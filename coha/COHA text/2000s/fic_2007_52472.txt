THE SUMMER BEFORE HE LEFT FOR COLLEGE Gib Harrell had been haunted by a fear too deep for reason . It was 1969 , he was eighteen , and he felt stalked by something terrible and mortal , afraid he was going to die before he 'd lived . Nothing he tried , not beer or weed or backseat groping , could take his mind from his dark thoughts ; and so when his uncle offered a job clearing some land out on the high plains of New Mexico , Gib took it . While his friends sweated the draft lottery back home in Memphis , he was camped alone in a stone sheepherder 's hut out on the Llano Estacado . Under a sky so wide he could track the passage of the sun from horizon to horizon , he hauled rocks the size of nail kegs and piled them into cairns . Nights he sat at the hut 's door , alert for rattlesnakes , many thicker than his arm . His shouts and wild stomp dances failed to rout them , and he slept uneasily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them off . He was n't sure the trick was anything but television cowboy lore , but it seemed to work , and he began to enjoy the night . Star clouds glimmered pale as glass , the Perseids shot sparks , and he liked to imagine he was the lone recipient of light from ages past . At the end of August he went off to Vanderbilt to begin the life that had proceeded without obstacle until the present . Now he was fifty . The millennium had newly turned . He had a sturdy marriage to a woman he loved , a son at Tulane and twin daughters in their last year of boarding school in Vicksburg , a radiology practice with congenial colleagues in his hometown , an orderly , contented life into which the black dog had come again . He saw death everywhere : in the starry efflorescences on X-ray firms , shadowy tumors , a near miss on the freeway , even when he mowed the lawn . His parents were in robust health , his children flourished , but these mercies somehow made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he feared , was running out , his number coming up . He decided that at summers end he 'd take time off and drive west on the back roads to the stretch of badland between Milnesand and Lingo to see if what had cured him before would cure him now . In the last days of August he drove the twins to St. Margaret 's , mustered them on the dormitory steps to deliver what they called his " danger talk " ; cautions about hair dryers near bathtubs , reminders about sunscreen and vitamins . They 'd heard it all before . Listing toward their classmates gathering in a grove , they pledged to be careful . " Nothing bad will happen , Dad . " He stood by while they murmured endearments to Hal-the deaf red setter who had come along for the ride-hugged them , and then remanded them to the delta heat and the other beautiful immortals waiting under the tupelos . He held open the car door so Hal could ricket his long body inside , and then got in himself , belted up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Mississippi was down . Sandbars stretched nearly to the middle where barges plied the coffee-colored water . As the bluffs of the battleground-so many dead , a mountain-receded in his rearview , it struck him that he 'd taken a wrong turn . This hitch rattled him , but there was no way to check the map until he reached the Louisiana side and pulled into the parking lot of a barbecue stand . A homemade sign proclaimed Lucky 's open for business . On the sign in front of Lucky 's name a vandal , or maybe Lucky himself , had spray-painted the letters UN . In a clump of knotgrass a billboard teetered . Across its collapsing scaffold plywood farm animals-a paint-scabbed cow , a pig in a top hat , a rooster wearing a jaunty-looking bib-jigged on hind legs . Smoke roiled from the chimney pipe of a meat smoker parked hazardously close to a propane tank . Briefly he wondered if he 'd warned the twins about what to do in case of fire . When he cracked the window , the hickory-and-vinegar smell of pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . Gib rubbed the dog 's ears , and then unfolded his map . He had just smoothed it across the steering wheel when Lucky 's screen door slapped open and out stormed a girl in purple shorts and a T-shirt the color of a Creamsicle . She hurried to a banged-up white Chevy Caprice , yanked open the squawking door , got in and started the engine , which roared like the big V8 it was . For a moment she rested her forehead on the steering wheel , and then she swung out to pull the door shut and slammed into reverse just as a young man appeared in the doorway . He wore a paper hat and a butcher 's apron smeared with what looked like blood or barbecue sauce . In a clotted voice he bawled obscenities at the girl . She braked , then shifted into drive . As she pulled across the lot the young man ran alongside the car , then heaved himself sideways in a martial arts kick so violent it dented the passenger door and left a waffle-grid boot print . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lugged onto the highway . Beyond wondering whether the scene had been a fragment of an ongoing argument or a final , overwrought parting , he gave little thought to the encounter except to marvel that if he had n't been just where he was just when he was , he never would have seen it . By the time he and Hal stopped for the night at a motel outside Little Rock , he 'd almost forgotten it . The next day he was passing a buffalo preserve in Oklahoma when he became aware that a car was bearing down behind him . He took it for a state trooper-the car was white , it rode low , its wide grille appeared to leer . But then the driver leaned on the horn and passed him . In the white blur he saw the dented door , the boot smudge still intact . Across the ribbed and gullied ranch land he marveled at the coincidence , and when in the early afternoon he saw the car a third time , crossing his westbound route and speeding north on a county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , he veered off to follow . His act was rash , foolhardy . Anyone who knew him would be shocked by what he 'd done . He was . But he was oddly exhilarated . In a harebrained way , he felt as if he were destined to take the chance , to follow her on whim , a breakaway . He told himself his trip to Milnesand had been put off so long , a few more hours would n't make a difference . He stayed back a quarter of a mile , but in such empty country it was n't hard to keep her in his sight . Late in the afternoon as they sped north on a sandy road to cross the Kansas line , his exhilaration had left him . His cell phone signal had gone flat-line , his fuel gauge below E. To save gas-he was n't sure if it mattered , but to be on the safe side-he cut the air-conditioning and rolled down the windows , letting the hot wind buffet him . He 'd exhausted his imagination as to her circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck him that the bare bones of his act were at best suspicious , at worst criminal , and that he 'd put himself in peril of running out of gas on a road to nowhere , a road so treeless that even the buzzards gathered around an armadillo carcass had no perch to flap away to and merely moseyed to the shoulder to let him pass . His warnings to his daughters oozed an irony that was ludicrous , and his tea-leaf reading for symbols and portents-Lucky 's ? a Caprice ? - was more crackpot than phrenology . In the distance a grain elevator promised a town he hoped he had enough gas to make . He wished the girl would turn off onto yet another side road so he could go on alone , leaving her to whatever fate she was bent on , but she made straight for the elevator . At the outskirts of a prairie town she pulled in beside the single pump of a rundown filling station , and he had no choice but to turn in . In order not to alarm her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a heap of asphalt slag . He left the engine running , rolled up the windows , and turned on the air conditioner for Hal , still dozing in the back , his chest falling and rising in heavy , olddog sleep . He was so relieved to have reached safety that when he got out of the car and hit the locks and shut the door , he did n't notice that he 'd left the keys in the ignition . He nodded to the attendant , a rangy youngster tipped back on one of the chrome-and-vinyl kitchen chairs on the concrete apron outside the door . The attendant touched his cap brim and then went back to chalking a pool cue . Gib fed quarters into the pop machine and then punched the button for root beer . When he 'd walked past the Caprice , the girl had been in the driver 's seat , but suddenly she stood behind him . " What are you , some kind of stalker ? " His root beer can clunked into the bin . He retrieved it and straightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so small and bony she seemed held together with wire and string , had made him think she was a girl . This close , he was shocked to see she was a woman , sixty or over if she was a day . She looked so hot and frazzled and sorely used that if she had n't sneaked up on him , he might have felt compassion for her and asked her what was wrong . She took a long pull from a blue bottle of antacid , recapped it , and then dropped it into the pocket of her baggy shorts . She put her hands on her narrow hips . The Creamsicle-colored T-shirt , billowing behind her in the hot wind , was plastered to her front . Beneath the shirt was a lump that made him think it was a colostomy bag . Training made him look for a MedicAlert bracelet , but she wore none . " Nothing better to do than follow me across the country ? " When he opened the root beer , the fizz sloshed over the can 's rim to drizzle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would n't spatter his khakis . " I thought you might be lost . " This was a lie , but how could he tell her why he 'd followed her when he was n't sure himself ? " It occur to you maybe I intend to be ? " There was a burned texture to the dark , dyed hair she 'd gathered into a stringy ponytail , and her skin seemed stretched over her cheekbones , giving her a skeletal look . At her scalp line ran a scattering of ulcerated sores . She stalked back to the pump to wrestle with the hose , shooting him a hateful glance . He raised a hand to show he meant no harm . " Just so you do n't go getting any big ideas , I 've got this . " From beneath her T-shirt where the lump had been she produced a pistol , a tiny thing , pearl handled ; a Ladysmith , he guessed . " Do n't think it is n't loaded . " He almost laughed ; her squint-eyed sneer made her look like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get on his way , he stood in front of the station window waiting for her to fill her tank , pretending interest in a display of Tom 's Peanut Logs . Heat waves rose from the hardpan lot . " Your engine 's about to quit , " offered the attendant , jerking a thumb toward the idling Cherokee . Embroidered on the attendant 's blue shirt were the initials R. D. " I know that , " Gib said shortly . R. D. sighted along the cue , balancing the fulcrum on his thumb , and then flipped the cue , rolled it deftly across his hand and snapping into shot position , " fust saying , is all . " Gib thought of walking over to turn off the car , but he did n't want to pass the pump and give her another opportunity to snarl . He went around the corner of the station to the men 's room . He would give her a head start and then take the opposite direction and work his way back to his mapped route . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , jotting something on a notepad . His tag numbers , he guessed , so she could report him . On what charge , he wondered . Superstition ? Folly ? R. D. craned around the cash register as if to size him up . At the precise moment Gib tried his car door and spotted the keys still dangling from the ignition , the engine died . He went around to all the doors , including the hatch window behind which his camping gear lay neatly stowed , but the car was sealed . On the backseat Hal lay as before , so deeply sacked that not even the ceasing of the engine vibrations roused him . R. D. had taken up his duty post on the kitchen chair and was working something out of his thumbnail with a jackknife blade . The woman 's car was still at the pump , but she was nowhere to be seen . Gib waved to get R. D. 's attention . " Locked myself out , " he said , " do you have one of those ... " He could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and R. D. 's look told him that he knew it but he had the livelong day to wait for him to get the phrase out , which he finally did , " ... a Slim Jim ? " Canting his chair so he could reach a clump of foxtail that sprouted from a crack , R. D. pulled up a stalk and damped it between his front teeth , for no purpose Gib could detect other than so he could mumble around it . " No can do . Illegal . " " A wire hanger ? " Gib reached into his pocket and brought out his wallet to see if he 'd tucked an extra key inside . He had n't . " The dogs locked in , " he said , hearing the rise in his voice . " He 's old and deaf , " he added , as if this made it worse . Sweat trickled into his eyes , making them sting from the sunscreen he 'd put on that morning . R. D. got up and ambled to the car . He peered inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then went into the station bay to root in a disordered tool bin . Gib , unable to meet the setters baleful gaze , followed . Discarding one object after another , R. D. at last brought up a narrow gauge file and a tangle of solder wire . He tripled the wire and twisted it , wound it around the file , then fashioned a noose at the end . " Looks like it 'll work " Gib said , trying to keep the urgency from his voice . " Pretty tricky deal . " R. D. tested the noose with an oil-blacked forefinger , then went to the car , set his stance , and began paving the wire into the space between the glass and gasket . Hal stood on the backseat , tongue lolling . When he caught sight of Gib , he gave a hopeful tail swipe . R. D. fiddled with the loop , wiped his brow with his sleeve . " Catch on these is pretty tricky . " Hal now sagged back down . Gib had brought the dog along because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their childhood they hung onto , what they left behind-but also because he liked the company . Hal was a riding dog ; say " car " or even mouth the word when he was looking , and the setter was at the door , chest out , nose up , alert . Now Gib did n't know whether to look at Hal or not to . Both seemed like betrayal . " Let me try , " he said , reaching for the file . R. D. shouldered him off , resank the wire . " Just needs a little English . " The woman had come over to watch . In her gritty little voice , she said , " I read that three minutes in a hot car can broil your brains . " Gib ignored her and R. D. went on working with the loop , each time coming up empty . She drifted off . In desperation , Gib ran to the slag pile and picked up a good-sized chunk of asphalt , intending to break a window , but by the time he returned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gripping a maul . " Hit the side one ! " R. D. yelled , but it was too late . She brought down the maul , the windshield crazed , then shattered . Gib brought down his rock on the hole she 'd made , caving the glass so he could reach inside and pop the lock . The woman opened the back door , clasped the dog around the chest , and hauled him out . She set him on the hot pavement where he sank to his haunches . " Water , " she yelled . R. D. said , " Gotcha , " and loped away . Stupid with relief , Gib knelt before the dog . Hal panted furiously , drooped more than usual . Still , Gib did n't think there 'd been any damage . " Thanks , " he said to the woman . " Georgette Boudreaux . " He looked at her , not comprehending ; he thought she might be speaking in a foreign language . " As in " Thanks , Georgette Boudreaux . ' " Although her smug prompt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescue to take issue . He stood up and repeated his thanks , this time using her name . R. D. returned , sloshing water over the rim of a dinged-up Baby Moon hubcap . He set the hubcap on the pavement . While Hal lapped noisily , R. D. inspected the shattered windshield , giving out a low whistle . To Gib he said dolefully , " I told her to hit the vent . " Georgette shrugged , taking another pull from her antacid bottle . A chalky imprint ringed her upper lip . " It 's all right , " Gib said . " It can be fixed . " He asked R. D. where the nearest glass shop was . R. D. pulled at his earlobe . " Closest anythings in Dodge . " " Dodge City ? Where are we ? " " Zenobia , the Pheasant Capital of the Sunflower State . " Georgette looked around . " I thought we were near Greensburg , Home of the World 's Largest Hand-Dug Well . " " How far ? " Gib asked . " From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the empty road , R. D. allowed that as soon as he got himself spruced up , he was headed there . " Play me some pool . I could pick you up a windshield and bring it back tomorrow . Put it in right here . " He gave Gib the once-over , taking in the expensive watch his wife Barbara had given him . " It 'd cost you . " When Gib did n't respond , R. D. said cagily , " Course you could try to drive it . Get you some duck tape and some Visquine . Maybe hang your head out the side window . We do n't have none of that here , though . Duck tape or Visquine either one . " His gaze darted swiftly to the station bay and then back to hold Gib 's stare . Gib took out his wallet . " How much ? " R. D. consulted his thumbnail . " Four , five hunnerd . " When Gib said he did n't have that much with him but that he had a credit card , R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand . " Got to be cash . No credit . Bad experience . " " Is there a bank ? " " Sure , but it 's closed . Saturday afternoon . " " But there 's an ATM ? " " In Dodge there is . " Georgette put in , " I could drive you , but you 'll have to wait until tomorrow . I want to see that hand-dug well . " As if sensing his chance slipping away , R. D. delivered a smart slap to his own forehead . " I got it . You could just send me into Dodge with that credit card . I can get the cash out of the ATM . Done it before for customers . Plenty of times . " Gib said he 'd call Triple A. " Shop phone 's on the blink " R. D. reported . " I 'll check into a motel and use the phone there . " R. D. cast an eye at Hal , who had returned from a foray into the sunflower field across from the station . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wrangled from R. D. the name of the nearest dog-taking motel , which turned out to be a short mile away and to cater to pheasant hunters . He arranged with R. D. to leave the car overnight in the station bay so he would n't have to unpack his camping gear , then gathered a few things and prepared to leave , thanking them again for the help . " Sorry I yelled at you , " Georgette said . " And about your windshield . " " No , I 'm glad . " He hazarded a laugh . " The windshield part , I mean . " Hal had come to lean against her leg . She patted his head . " Just about lost you , did n't we ? " she said tenderly . " You were almost a goner . A doggie goner . " She smiled at her feeble joke , and the lowering sun glared on her features , on her thin , yellowish skin , the wrinkles around her eyes as she looked up at Gib . " I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You two can join me if you want . It 's the least I can do , since I 'm the one who bashed your window . " The little laugh she gave was surprisingly pleasant , but more than anything Gib wanted to be done with her . " I should be here when the tow truck comes , but thanks . " He added , " Georgette Boudreaux . " " At least let me drive you to the motel . " When she opened the Caprice 's dented door , Hal lumbered in and sat at ride position on the center of the bench seat . " Thanks , again , " Gib said . He got in beside the dog . " Sure you do n't want to camp ? " she asked , when they pulled up to the motel office and got a look at the tumbledown building . He thought of her gun , her earlier attitude . One heedless act was enough . " This is fine . " He thanked her a final time and then watched as she drove away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affair , the doors stenciled with crescent moons so that the effect was of a row of outhouses . Beside the building ran the tall chain-link fence of a defunct kennel , and the place , he thought as he checked in , looked more un than Lucky 's . His room , equipped with a swamp cooler that dripped into a Maxwell House can and a matted shag carpet that smelled of hound , boded a miserable night . But the telephone worked and he called AAA . They promised to send a tow truck in the morning . In the middle of the night he was startled awake by a noise that seemed to come from the bathroom , a drawn-out scrape that sounded like a metal ladder being dragged across a rock bed . Hal 's knobby backbone was pressed into his side , and the dog had n't stirred . The scraping grew louder , rhythmic now , and so he got up and went into the bathroom . He pushed open the frosted glass of the window and stood on the tub rim to look outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ell that abutted the motel . Midway down it was a storm door , the top screen bellied inward and the lower one shredded , leading from a mound of broken boards and carpet scraps into the darkness of the ell . Above the rubble , protruding from the door 's lower opening , were the hindquarters of a large brindle dog , its back paws scrabbling against the pitted aluminum , head and forelegs having made the hurdle . The sight was so surreal that Gib could n't help thinking about all the events that had led up to his seeing it . Just as it occurred to him to stop making the sight a private omen and to go outside to help , the dog heaved its weight inside the ell , the door rattled and shook , and then all was still . He was awakened early the next morning by the sound of a horn . He got up and opened the door , expecting to see the tow truck driver , but there stood Georgette . Hal thumped his tail against the chenille spread , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faded Power Rangers beach towel and a box of baking soda , she looked worse than she had the day before . The skin on her face was inflamed , her arms and legs striated with long red wheals , some already suppurating . " Picked out a dandy campsite , " she said , " but a bunch of chiggers beat me to it . " She tried to laugh , but her lower lip drew up and her chin pitted the way his daughters " did when they were hurt but trying to be brave . Then she cleared her throat and jutted her jaw , her truculence regained . " Since you owe me one , you could let me use your bathtub " Despite her mean little bulldog face , she looked so miserable he could n't refuse . He gathered his things , leashed Hal , and went outside to wait . The tow truck arrived while she was still in the bathtub . He tapped on the bathroom door to teil her he was leaving , and then went out and climbed hi beside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personage known as Georgette Boudreaux . When he got to the station , he found his Cherokee still in the bay , but the station was closed , the doors locked tight , and R. D. was nowhere to be found . The tow truck driver called the Zenobia sheriff , who roared up in a dust-caked Suburban studded with antennas , but there was nothing he could do . R. D. was famous for his Dodge City benders . It would take an act of God to see him back in town before late Sunday night . Monday was more likely . Gib suggested a locksmith , but the sheriff shook his head . " Legal issues . Court orders , all like that . Be Monday , Tuesday at the outside . Best you can do is wait him out . Old R. D. will come on back . " He took off his hat and spanked it against his Levi 's to shake the dust off , then put it back on . He sighed . " Kid never has n't . " There was nothing to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still parked outside his door , which Georgette was just closing behind her . " Hello , puppy . Hello , hello , hello . " She bent to pet Hal , who leaned against her legs as if for shelter . Though her skin was still inflamed , she seemed a bit improved . Her hair was wet , which made her look older and smaller than before . As she slung her things into the Caprice , he told her what had happened at the station . " Look here , " she said , " I was going to see the worlds largest hand-dug well , but I overshot it . Now I owe you one . For the bathtub . I might as well drive you up to Dodge . We can hunt down R. D. and get the station key from him . How many pool joints can there be ? We could be back here by noon . It might be fun . A big adventure . " The idea that they would " hunt down " R. D. sounded ominous . He had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy-he was a boy , Gib was certain of it-back at the barbecue stand . " I 'll wait . " " Seriously . What else have you got to do ? " She eyed him quizzically . " What are you doing out here anyway ? " He explained about Milnesand , his time there , that he wanted to see it again . She crossed her arms over her meager chest . Today she wore the same baggy purple shorts and orange T-shirt , but she had added a black sweatshirt emblazoned with red flames licking at the words BAD TO THE BONE . " Just to look at it ? " " Maybe camp a night or two . Take some pictures . " It struck him only then that his Nikon was locked inside the station bay . " Hey , I 'm not as mean as I let on , " she said . " Why do n't we just go out there ? You can have your look , and then we 'll turn around and come back . By then your car 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barbara did n't expect him for days , and she did n't expect him to call ; the trip was open-ended . Still , he wanted to know more about Georgette , a diagnostic interview from which he could determine whether she was a full-bore sociopath or just a rough little character . " What are you doing way out here ? " he asked . " Are n't you from around Vicksburg ? " At her startled look , he explained that he 'd seen her at the barbecue stand , the coincidences that led him to follow her . She nodded as if his act had fallen in the realm of normal , and to his surprise-he 'd judged her as a simpler person , probably unread-she said , " Kismet ? " " Sort of . " " My son lives in Vicksburg , but I 'm from Jackson . " It embarrassed him to repeat his question , but he wanted to know . " And why are you all the way out here ? " " Long story . " She knelt to pet Hal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the dog . " I 'm on a pilgrimage . Oh , yes , I am . " She held her pose , stroking Hal but looking up at Gib . " Going around to see weird roadside things . World 's largest ball of twine . Quigley 's Castle-thing is built out of rocks and bottles . The stuff people make , the pitiful wonders of the world . " " You took off work to do this ? " " I 'm ... " she gave a comic cough , " retired . Can you believe I once taught highschool science ? " " Why not ? " " And then I decided to become an outlaw ? " He was n't sure how to take her , but he laughed . " What about you ? What do you do for a living ? " When he told her , she nodded , as if the fact of his profession fit somehow into her scheme of things . She straightened up and looked at him levelly . " Is the inquisition over ? Do I pass ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car door-her son , he guessedbut suddenly this did n't seem to matter . " Do I ? " She cocked her head and squinted . " No funny stuff ? " He took her meaning . Though the idea would have been last on his mindwith her or anyone-the fact that this scrawny little bug-bitten person worried that he might have such designs pulled his heart toward her . " No funny stuff . " " I already know your name and where you 're from . " She gestured toward the motel office , where from a crack in the Venetian blinds the clerk was observing them . " When I came to find you this morning , could n't figure out which room you were in ; so I told him I was undercover FBI and you were a fugitive traveling under an alias . I had a good look at the registration . Pretty tricky deal , eh ? " She pulled a cagey , sly-eyed face that looked so much like R. D.s that he had to laugh . He shook his head in astonishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go that far " she said drily , but he could tell that she was pleased . By noon they 'd driven through the Texas panhandle , taking a side trip so Georgette could see an immense white cross that dwarfed the trees at its base . She traveled without a map . " Dead reckoning , " she said , narrowing her eyes against the road glare , against his incredulity . The day was hot and windy . Russian thistle blew across the road , piled up along the fence lines . She was a lead-foot driver , and more than once he jammed his foot flush with the footboard . Outside Clovis on a county road she tailgated a mufflerless pickup , green as arsenic where it was n't eaten up with rust , its bed piled high with microwave oven boxes . Three surly-looking men riding on the boxes glowered , but when Gib suggested she slow down , she shrugged . " Pistol 's in the glove box . " The more time he spent with her , the more he noticed her age . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around awhile so she could unkink herself . She moved as arthritically as Hal . She traveled with a case of Maalox . Stowed in her backseat where Hal rode were blankets , pillows , a tent , a camp stove , a box fan , and brown paper grocery bags full of various supplies . One bag appeared to hold dozens of empty orange prescription vials , but he did n't think she was an addict . He had n't seen her put anything in her mouth except the eggs she ate for breakfast , a ham sandwich for lunch , innumerable sips of antacid . There was something not quite right about her , but she appeared to be glad for his company and she had set herself into a fine , determined mood , so he gave up speculating . The Caprice rode smoothly , lulling him into a pleasant out-of-body-ness , an anesthesia of hot wind and tire rhythm , the everlasting sameness of the rolling plains . She handed him a bag of pork rinds . Open that for me , will you ? " Holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bag and handed it to her . She took a rind and crunched meditatively . " Remember when you were a kid and you 'd go on family trips , those guessing games ? I see something green ? Let 's play one , all right ? I 'll give you three guesses to figure out what I have . " " In your hand ? A pork rind . " " No , what disease . What diagnosis . " She was ill . He should have known ; she had all the signs . The look about her eyes , her skin . Once , when she smiled , the word rictus had come to him . He 'd been so busy judging her on other counts-clothes , pistol , temperament-he 'd missed the obvious . " Why do n't you just tell me ? " " Here 's a head start . It 's a connective tissue disorder . " His curiosity kicked in . " Rheumatoid arthritis ? " " Good guess , but no .

There were scores of questions he could ask , numberless details , but the disease was incurable , heralding a painful death . " What are you taking for it ? " " Nothing . I flushed the lot and I do nt want to hear a word about it . " They were far out in the country , the road leading through folds and rises , across unexpected arroyos . In the distance herds of bounding antelope flashed white as wheeling gulls .

" She shrugged , then made a show of peering through the windshield . " Should n't we be coming up on that rock of yours ? " They were closing in on the area where a limestone pillar slashed with three diagonal cuts would mark the turnoffto the land he 'd broken , but nothing looked right . In his vision of the trip he came over a crest to see the stark brown hills stretching to the edge of earth , the sky blue and high ; but even the view seemed off . He was unnerved by her casual announcement that she planned to take her life . He 'd never settled the question in his mind , and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasions he 'd been called to deal with it as the resident on call , when there was n't " DNR " on a patient 's chart-Do Not Resuscitate-he 'd gone by the book . The light changed , the hills cast in shadow as a cloud passed overhead . He said , " I think we missed it . We should turn around . " She pulled to the side of the road , staring ahead , her face impassive . " Get out , Gib . This is the end of the line . " At first , thinking she was joking , he laughed at her bad movie dialogue and its clench-jawed Dirty Harry delivery . But when she deepened her glare , he understood that she was serious . He did n't know what he 'd done or failed to do . He 'd barely reckoned with the news . Again , the consequences of his rash action swirled around him , seeming to settle like the dust now drifting through the open window . It was late afternoon . They were at least ten miles from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He would have to carry Hal , who could n't walk more than a quarter of a mile before he gave out . " Water , " he said , thinking of the plastic jugs they 'd filled outside Clovis . " Will you let us take one ? " The dog stood up , nose over the seat back . Georgette gave Gib a sidelong look . " Hal can stay . But you get out . " " Oh God , " he said . Hals hot breath wafted over his shoulder . Something made of cellophane crackled under the dog 's feet . He could overpower her . She was so small and sick , she 'd have no strength . In front of him was the glove box , the pistol wrapped in a red oil rag . As if she 'd read his mind , she said , " Do n't even think about it . " " Listen , " he began , but he did n't know what to say . A smile played at the corners of her lips . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car , then at least just look around . " Fear , chagrin , disgust with himself had stupefied him . " Lets play another guessing game , " she said , now patiently , the high-school teacher she claimed to be . She gestured out the window . " I see something made of limestone with three slashes clearly marking . . . " He saw it , then , the pillar in the weeds beside the road , smaller than he 'd remembered , and he went limp with relief . " Did you really think I 'd kick you out ? " She cut her eyes at him . " Do n't trust me for a minute , do you ? " Before he could lie and say he did , she shifted into reverse , backed up , then aimed the car toward some high ground that provided a passage across the ditch , and set off bumpily across the grassland . " Do nt feel bad , " she said . " I would n't either . " She yanked the wheel to dodge a boulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two . " She looked at him out of the corner of her eye . " Thanks , by the way . " " For what ? " " Not putting up an argument . You really would have gotten out , would n't you ? " With a fist she pounded on the steering wheel , crowing , " Boy , I must be tough ! " What he 'd had in mind was to walk the acres , spend the night camped near the hut , courting the feeling he 'd had before , but now , as they threshed through prickly pear and Mormon tea , across loose rock and shaling outcrops , the place felt wrong . In its boundlessness he felt dislocated and unreal , unable to connect the man he was now to the boy he 'd been at eighteen . A mile or so in they found the sheepherder 's hut a pile of rubble , its tin roof gone . They walked down the grass around it , pitched her tent , fed and watered Hal and made a bed for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit to watch the night come on . In such wide space , the sun seemed to take its time going down . Darkness crept in from the east and in the last light the rolling ground looked molten . Overhead a goshawk dived , then soared again . Bats swooped . It was too dry and windy to make a fire , and so in the moonlight they ate the sandwiches they 'd bought in Clovis . The sky was spangled and the Milky Way stretched like a broad white road . Falling stars crisscrossed each other . She pointed out the Seven Sisters , glittering . He could n't shake from his mind what she planned to do . " What about the rest of your family ? " " Long gone . I 'm a stray . A human tumbleweed . " She stretched out on the blanket , put her hands behind her head . " Orphaned , divorced , a foster person . " " Did you ever try to ... ? " " Find them ? Sure . I 'm trying now . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm out driving that I 'll run into somebody or something , catch the tag end of a conversation or see something that rings a bell , and that will put it all together . But I do nt even know my real last name . Its like this lost word out there that if I hear , everything will come back . " He nodded . Milnesand had been named for a windmill in a dry gulch that settlers called " the mill in the sand , " slurring the phrase to form an oddly pronounced word . The mill was gone and the name was all that remained of the place . He considered offering this information , but in the face of the unknowables she lived with , the observation would be heartless . " My mother came from Oklahoma but I do n't know where . It was the Dust Bowl so I did n't come with papers . No birth certificate , no nothing . Well , a picture of us when I was a baby , but that 's all . Her face was blurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding this dandelion . Nita-that 's my foster-wrote a caption on it : " How Okies Look to Natives . " I 'd ask her what it meant , but she could n't say exactly . The separateness in people , the strangers they are to each other , something like that . " She was just a girl , my mother , when she left me . She meant to come back , my fosters said , but something must have happened . She followed rodeo , so maybe ... Did you know that Pretty Prairie , Kansas , is home to the world 's largest night rodeo ? " He shook his head . Hal yawned widely , stretched . The last full moon of summer shone a silvery path across the darkened bench land . " But then , Nita was a talker . She made up a lot of things . Probably to spare my feelings . " " But you believed her ? " " Sometimes . She said I was part Indian , too , but that 's the kind of thing drunks brag about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but now everybody wants to be one . More romantic . Mystic . But I 'll tell you , if as many people were as claimed they were and even halfway cared to , red people could take back the country . At least the western half . That 's my idea of revolution . Would n't that be something ? " From the arroyo coyotes yipped and howled . Hal lay drowsing , too deaf to hear them , too old , Gib realized with a pang , to howl back . " Now I figure I 'll know everything when I 'm a ghost . " She sat up and began to pick through Hal 's coat for burrs , collecting them in a neat pile . " What about you ? " As he told it , his life sounded privileged and charmed . Because it shamed him that he 'd had things so easy , he tried to put a wry tone to his account to show he was aware how mild and safe his life had been . She did n't speak for a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have dozed off , but then she said , " Do n't feel like you 've got something over me because you know who you 're related to . Sometimes it 's best if you do n't . Besides , I figure everybody 's got to be somebody 's **26;2631;TOOLONG . " He could make no sense of her theory of lineage , and so he gave up trying . " Maybe so , " he said . " You sound like that radio guy on the prairie show , " she said . " You sigh when you talk , and you make these little whistling noises when you breathe . " " Sorry " " No , it 's a good sound . Like somebody 's voice you sort of think you know . " She gave Hal a pat and then pushed up from the blanket , getting to her feet . " Except I have to tell you , Gib , it puts me and my pal Hal to sleep . " He planned to bunk on the bench seat of the car while she took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 'd rest better sitting up in the front seat , she said , it eased the pain of reflux . " Besides " - she gave him the half-eye- " a fugitive such as yourself , how do I know you wo n't hotwire the car and leave me stuck out here in bee-eff Egypt ? " Getting into the spirit of her banter , he said , " You do n't . Maybe I 'm an outlaw , too . " She cackled , pleased . He walked off a ways from the campsite to urinate , to give a last look toward the stars . He tried to let his mind expand to take in the vastness , but he was too weary for long thoughts . Maybe when he was in his own car driving home , something profound would come to him . When he crawled inside the tent , Georgette was already there . " Hal insisted " she informed him . " It 's fine , " he said . " The car 's just fine for me . No problem . " She patted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutual friend insists . There 's room enough . " Hal , tongue lolling , gathered himself beside her , thumped his tail against the blankets as if to ratify her invitation . On his hands and knees , Gib hesitated until she said exasperatedly , as she might to a house cat havering at a door , " Gibson , in or out . We 're only going to sleep . " Later , when he was back in Memphis and he came to the part in the story of his absurd trip that he would tell himself but no one else , he would remember how fragile the bones of her spine felt when she nestled hers against his . Hal lay backed into her ; her arm was slung over the dog 's chest . For a long time they lay that way , Gib conscious of her breathing , of her smallness , of the unlikely tableau they made-dog , woman , man-a thousand miles from home in a dark tent on an empty plain under a moon close enough for light but too far away for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them faced the same direction , and when he put his arm around Georgette , she gave a tired sigh . " Cousin , that feels better than you know . " Her breath-acrid , ketotic-seemed to gather in the air above them . They slept . The next morning in the gray light of false dawn Hal stood over him on stalky legs , tethered with his leash to a tent stake . A look outside told him the car was parked where they had left it , but Georgette was gone . He called her name , his voice insignificant in the endless space , but no answer came ; and so he put on his shoes , went out to check the car , thinking she 'd given up on the tent and bunked-up on the car 's bench seat . The red oil rag lay on the seat , the glove box hung open , empty . He swore . At a run , trying to recall whether or not a shot had awakened him , he set off for the rise from which he had framed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw himself finding her body in the arroyo , driving her car to the nearest town and trying to explain . Hal followed as if they were on a romp , tail waving , in high spirits . Just before they reached the arroyo Hal sniffed at the air and then turned off in a rachitic lope toward a low-lying thicket of sapling cottonwoods . The wind licked at the leaves to flick them white side up , and the quaking cottonwoods shimmered like a mirage , from which Georgette emerged . Fury dizzied him , and then a feeling of relief so callow and self-serving-it had n't happened on his watch-he gasped . She walked toward him , slinging the pistol as if it were an extension of her hand , and suddenly he was yelling at her . She tucked the pistol into her shorts . " How could I do whafi Go out to whiz ? " Hal swagged his tail across the tail weeds , licked her hand . Struck dumb , Gib gestured toward the lump the pistol made . She shrugged . " Rattlesnakes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the dog ? " " Same reason , Sherlock . I 'm supposed to be everywhere at once ? Are n't you going to ask me how I feel ? " He could only stare . " Never mind , I 'll tell you . Like a million bucks , all green and wrinkled . Worse for wear . You 're not the quietest bedmate . You snored worse than a troll . And you drive , OK ? " After they broke camp and packed the car , she said , " Look , Doctor Kildare , I would n't put another person in that spot . Not even a stranger . I 'd leave a note , for pity 's sake . " All the way back to Zenobia , they rode in a silence that if he did n't feel so foolish and unsettled he would have called companionable . She swigged Maalox , served as a morbid little tour guide pointing out turkey buzzards circling on updrafts , a road-killed bobcat , a rest stop on the high plains where a sign painted in park service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the counter in a motel coffee shop in the heat-blasted state-line town of Texhoma , he asked , " Where will you go after you drop me off ? " " Up to see that well , then maybe over to have a look at the Garden of Eden . Some old jasper forged all the scenes from the Old Testament in scrap iron . Or concrete or whatever . Quite the deal , I hear . " She took a sip of coffee , grimaced , and then shook off a shudder . " Hey , last night I think I figured out the reason people build the things they do . World 's biggest this , world 's only that . " He waited , wondering if it would offend her if he invited her to come back with him to Memphis . Care could be arranged , a place found , he could visit and watch over things . Barbara would come around . She 'd probably be glad he heeded an impulse , even one that put her out . One of the few contentions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They make the little ones because they 're poleaxed by the big ones . What do you think of that ? " He did n't know if what made him speak was guilt or compassion or some combination of the two . " I was thinking that maybe you 'd come up to Memphis . You 'd be closer to your son . There 's hospice care , and I know a couple of good . . . " " Forget about it , Gibson . I know what I 'm doing . I figure I started out on the road and that 's where I 'D wind up . End to end . A balance . Poetic whatever . " He wanted to do something , but she seemed to have shut all the doors . " Is there anything ? " She rolled her eyes , then smirked , jabbing him with her elbow . " Look me up when you 're a ghost . We 'll have ourselves another camp-out . " He made a noise low in his throat he hoped passed for a chuckle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel any better , I 'll go back and talk to Robbie . I do n't like things the way I left them , but I had to clear my head . " He nodded , but he was n't sure if he believed her . That afternoon when they pulled into the station at Zenobia , his Cherokee was parked out front , a new windshield installed . R. D. was scraping at the sticker . " Howdy , howdy , " he hailed them , his welcome both hangdog and hearty . " You 're good to go . I even gassed her up , no charge . " R. D. explained that the sheriff tracked him down in Dodge and blessed him out . " So I done it on good faith . You can just mail me the check . " When Gib asked him how much , R. D. said grandly , " Cost . " He pantomimed a twist on an imaginary cue . " Won me a little something . " Gib went inside to settle the amount and copy the stations address , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a farewell stark enough for Georgette to countenance , even if it was just to say thanks for the ride and he was glad he met her , no solicitude , no vows to keep in touch that she could growl at , she was already steering the Caprice across the culvert . Beside her on the seat , Hal sat at attention , a paw on the dashboard to steady himself , his long nose lifted toward the road ahead . Gib called out , but she did n't stop . " Wait ! " he shouted , but she rolled on . R. D. hurried to the door , and he shouted , too . " Pull over ! " Despite the loss it meant , despite the explanation he would have to make when he got home , Gib called out to tell her Hal was hers , that she could take him , but he was n't certain she heard , was less certain she cared . She stuck her arm out the Chevy 's open window and raised two fingers in a salute that to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then she hit the gas and sped away . R. D. stood beside him . " That 's your dog she 's running off with , dude . " Gib said yes , it was . " That 's wrong , " R. D. said . " You get her tag number ? Mississippi plates . . . " " It 's all right . " " You want me to call up J. D. ? " " J. D. ? " " My dad . The sheriff . He could head her off. ? " When Gib told him there was no need , R. D. seemed at a loss as to how to be of aid . He gestured toward the chair next to his in front of the station . Absurd as the offer was , Gib was grateful for it and he took a seat , tilting back to rest his head against the wall . In the field across the road sunflowers bowed and waved in the prevailing breeze . A meadowlark swooped from a power line to disappear among the blooms . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trill sounding for all the world like language , like the answer to a riddle or a question he had yet to form . Watching the field , he waited for the meadowlark to rise , for the song to come again , but all was quiet . It was as though the bird had never been . For a long time before he stood up to be on his way , he sat quietly beside his host , dazed by chance and sorrow , time and-for a wonder-love .
