Chapter One An easy and convincing case could be made that my life has been short on successes , both financial and romantic , but no one could say with any conviction it has been uneventful . In fact , of late , it had been so full of events , I concluded I had outlived my allotment of outlandish moments , and now the law of averages was on my side for pursuing a relatively tame existence . At least until old age set in and I took up residence in a cardboard box beneath the overpass on Highway 59 , taking a dump behind a bush and licking secret sauce off old Big Mac wrappers for sustenance . That was how I figured most of us baby boomers would finish the race . No Medicaid . No Medicare . No insurance . No couple of million stashed back for our dotage . Maybe not even the cardboard box . Hell , for that matter , we could n't even be assured of a bush to shit behind . My dotage was a ways off yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though I had days when I wished I would n't make that geriatric goal-end up in a cardboard box , stiff and rotting beneath an overpass with one of those Big Mac wrappers clutched in my fist-nor did I wish to gain the better scenario of passing on to the great beyond via a crisp white bed in a nursing home with a plate of mashed green peas on my dinner tray and a tube in my dick . My best friend , Leonard Pine , always says the best way to go is lying in bed listening to a Patsy Cline song , or watching the last fifteen minutes of Championship Wrestling , which was funny enough to kill you . None for me , though . Times like that , when I was blue and thinking of my exit , I wished to go out between the legs of some wild redhead while striving for a double on a cool winter night , her hot breath in my ear , her fingernails buried in my ass like tacks in a bulletin board . It could happen . Currently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , forties , her life full of her own unique events . Including setting fire to the head of an ex-husband and beaning his brainpan with the business end of a shovel . But even though she might worry me some when near matches or farm implements , going out between her legs was , as I said , not such a bad way to pass , so I tried to stay within her proximity as much as possible these days , lest I feel a bit of a murmur , a flashing of life 's events before my eyes . I could only hope if such a dire situation arose , she would be in the mood and I could fight off the inevitable for whatever time was necessary for me to selfishly satisfy myself . But redheads have drawbacks . They can be trouble and they can mess up your law of averages , even when they do n't mean to , even when they are n't directly responsible . Trouble sticks to them like pork to a pig 's ass , and if the trouble is n't on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know that sounds a little like astrology-the stuff about redheads , not pork-but then again , you been through what I been through , you might come to believe it . And even if I do n't believe it in the long run , in the short run , well , I got to consider it . For me all this got to rolling on a day when I was sorting my stuff in Leonard 's barn , where it had been stored for the last few months . Leonard had owned a house in town for some time now , and when a tornado took my place away , I moved into his old country place , and it was n't so bad . Then he sold his house in town for pretty good money , had to move back to his country place , and now we were housemates . Frankly , I felt put out . Even if it was his house . I went from sleeping in the bedroom to sleeping on the couch , and he made me clean up the place more than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short time , and it had been okay , but now I had gotten used to living alone again , and I was having a bad time of it . Worse yet , way things were going , I might be moving in with my nasty redhead any day . Brett had invited me , and I wanted to , but I was having so much trouble readjusting to Leonard , and I had known him for years , the idea of living with someone else was goddamn scary . I was suddenly concerned about skid marks in my underwear . Socks that did n't match . Farts , burps , and stink from the bathroom . I wished my house had n't blown away . I wished I were n't so set in my ways . I even wished I could find a good deal on a mobile home to move to the acreage where my house once stood . And if you knew how much I dislike mobile homes-those plyboard and aluminum tornado magnets in the pleasing shape of a shiny rectangle-you 'd realize just how desperate I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The one that always wanted a relationship . I did n't have a woman in my life , I was pouty and blue , and even watching the September lovebugs hump made me horny . Now I had met someone who had more to offer than just sex . Brains . Humor . A way with fire and shovels . Kind of a middle-aged man 's dream , I suspect . And still , I hesitated . Guess , when you come right down to it , you just ca n't make me happy . Anyway , I was on my knees , sorting my stuff in Leonard 's barn , which was essentially a gray , peeling , clapboard shell with a dirt floor . I had all my things in cardboard boxes , and I was trying to figure what I should keep and what I should get rid of . During the storm , a large part of my junk had been rained on , wind-blasted , and just generally screwed . Rats had been in it since , and some of the paper and cloth items had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been halfheartedly going through the stuff I 'd gathered up after the storm . Going through it , not so much afraid of what I might find , but more afraid of what I might not find . Some part of my life gone . The twister had knocked the largest part of my goods ass over tea kettle , blown them to hell , or maybe worse , all the way to New York City . Maybe up North some Yankee was looking at my books , wearing one of my shoes . Laughing at my photographs . My favorite pants might be in a tree somewhere . My record collection at the bottom of a lake . It was too goddamn depressing to contemplate . I had just put a batch of ruined books in the trash box when Leonard came into the barn . He was wearing sweats and carrying two cups of coffee . He looked as if he was straight from the shower . His short kinky hair glistened and his face looked like buffed ebony . The sunlight shone brightly through the door behind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee , blending with the dust motes in the air . Leonard said , " You going to move in with her ? " I stood and brushed the dust off my hands . Leonard gave me a cup . " I do n't know , " I said , and sipped the coffee . It was good rich coffee with some kind of chocolate flavoring in it . " You ought to . " " You trying to get rid of me ? " " Some . You 're fuckin ' up my house . " " Like it 's anything special . " " Hey , it may be a shack , but it 's better than your shack , which , I might point out , would be harder to put together than one of those thousand-piece landscape puzzles . If you had all the pieces . " " Touch ? " " And the way you handle your domestic business , man , it 's tiresome . Think I want to have your old smelly drawers hanging on my couch arms for doilies ? Goddamn shoes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the chair . Hell , man , smells like someone 's been wiping their ass and hidin ' the paper somewhere . " " You 're exaggerating . " " All right , then , your shoes are slightly off center of the middle of the floor . But I still trip over them . Now what about Brett ? You movin ' in with her , or not ? " " I 've been burned so many times in love I 'm not sure I want to go through it again . " " Yeah , but all your other relationships were stupid . This one is n't . " " She set her husband 's head on fire , burned his car too . " " Do n't forget she beaned him with a shovel and he 's in a home somewhere trying to decide if blue socks go with a paper hat and a fart . " " There 's that . " " Maybe she should have left the car alone , Hap , but way I see it , far as his head 's concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't burn his whole head up , just some of it . Guy beats a woman on a daily basis , and one day she 's had enough , it 's okay she sets the guy 's head on fire . " " This coming from an arsonist . " " Do n't bring that up . You 're tryin ' to change the subject . Law let me go , did n't they ? " " It was a miracle . " And it was . Leonard had burned down three crack houses , and each time he 'd managed to get off . ' Course , I helped burn down one of them , so I could n't be too self-righteous . " They let Brett go , did n't they ? " Leonard said . " The judge was a lecher . She was young then . She wore tight shorts and a halter top . I 'm surprised they did n't throw her a parade and give her the key to the city . Way she looks now , back then , man , she must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hard for me to know what a good-lookin ' woman 's supposed to look like , but I figure Brett 's it . She 's got all her workin ' parts , do n't she ? " " Yeah . " " You get along , do n't you ? " " Yeah . She 's funny . I like being around her . We seem to have something going besides dating and rutting , although I hasten to add I do n't want to undervalue rutting . " " Then what 's the holdup ? " " I just do n't want to screw up again . " " Hap , that 's what you do best . And if you ai n't willin ' to screw up , you ai n't ever gon na get any of the good out of life either . That 's the way of the world , according to Leonard Pine . And keep in mind I just went through somethin ' worse , and I 'm out here lookin ' for love all over again . It 's the way of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yeah , but we 're consistently stupid . So , you get what I 'm sayin ' ? " " You 're as big a screwup as me ? " " No one is , Hap . But thing is , even though you fuck up more than most , everyone fucks up . Only difference with you is you think your fuckups matter more than anyone else 's . Strangely enough , there 's a kind of conceit in all that . " " I reckon you 're right . " " Good . Why do n't you tell her you 're moving in ? " " Because I 'm still not sure . " " You see her today , right ? " " Right . " " She 's expecting an answer , right ? " " Right . " " Do it . " ( Continues ... )
