Charlotte had already picked the lettuces and set them , along with the bunches of asparagus tied with twine and the mason jars of fresh-faced pansies , out on the table in a shaded spot at the end of the drive . In July , she would have to pay someone to man the farm stand , but in June not so many customers were around , and those who did come by found a table holding a wicker basket with a small whiteboard propped next to the basket . In colored chalk , the prices for the day 's offerings were listed , and a note : Everything picked fresh today . Please leave the money in the basket . Thanks and blessings from Beach Grass Garden . She had n't been cheated yet . She knew the customers thought this way of doing business was quaint , harkening back to a simpler time , and they appreciated it . Perhaps it helped them believe the world was still a safe and honest place . <br> The day was overcast but hoeing was hot work and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trunk of an apple tree , uncapped her water bottle , and took a long delicious drink . Nantucket had the best water on the planet : sweet , pure , and clear . It was shady in this overgrown spot , so she lifted off the floppy straw hat she wore , in addition to a heavy slathering of sunblock , and sighed in appreciation as a light breeze stirred her hair . <br> She could n't linger , she had too much to do . She took another long drink of water , listened to her stomach rumble , and considered returning to the house for an early lunch . <br> When she heard the voices , she almost jumped . <br> People were talking on Bill Cooper 's side of the fence , just behind the green tangle of wild grapevines . Hunky Bill Cooper and his gorgeous girlfriend . From the tense rumble of Coop 's voice and Miranda 's shrill whine , they were n't happy . <br> " Come on , Mir , do n't be that way . " Bill 's tone was placating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What way would that be ? " A sob caught in Miranda 's throat . " Truthful ? " <br> The moment had definitely passed , Charlotte decided , when she could clear her throat , jump up , and call out a cheerful hello . Vague snuffling sounds informed her that Bill 's dogs , Rex and Regina , were nearby , nosing through the undergrowth . She thought about the layout of Bill 's land : along the other side of the fence grew his everlasting raspberry bushes . The berries would n't be ripe yet , so Bill and Miranda must be taking the dogs for a walk as they often did . She was glad the berry bushes grew next to the fence , their prickly canes forming a barrier between Bill 's land and Nona 's . A tangle of grasses massed around barberry bushes was wedged against the fence , and then there were the tree trunks . They would pass by any moment now . She would keep very quiet . Otherwise it would be too embarrassing , even though she had a right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never lied to you , Miranda . I told you I was n't ready for a long-term commitment , especially not when you 're in New York all winter . " <br> " You could come visit me . " <br> " I do n't like cities , " Bill argued mildly . <br> " Well , that 's pathetic . And sleeping with that  --  that slut  --  is pathetic . " Miranda was striding ahead of Bill . She cried out , " Rex , you stupid , stupid dog ! You almost tripped me . " <br> " Mir , simmer down . " Bill sounded irritable , at the end of his patience . <br> Miranda did n't reply but hurried into the orchard of ancient apple trees . Bill followed , crashing through the brush . Charlotte could hear a few more words  --  I 'm not kidding ! It 's over , Bill !  --  then she heard the hum of their voices but no words , and then they were gone . <br> " Gosh , " Charlotte whispered to herself . <br> Charlotte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coop was a hunk , but so easygoing and funny that when you talked with him you could almost forget how handsome he was . She seldom saw him , even though he lived right next door . Of course , " right next door " was a general term . Nona 's property consisted of ten acres with fifty feet of waterfront on Polpis Harbor , and the Coopers ' land was about the same size . With all the plantings , you could n't see one house from the other , even in winter when all the leaves had fallen . <br> Like the Wheelwrights , the Coopers mostly summered on the island , the Wheelwrights coming from Boston , the Coopers from New York . Eons ago , when they were all little kids , Coop had played a lot with Charlotte 's brother Oliver , even though Oliver was younger , because Coop was an only child , and the two families got together several times over the summer for cocktails or barbecues . Then came the years when they rarely saw each other , everyone off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the island . <br> Coop lived in California for a while , but three years ago his parents moved to Florida and Coop moved into the island house , telling everyone he wanted to live here permanently . He ran a computer software business from his nineteen-sixties wandering ranch house , mixed his plasma TV and Bose CD player in with his family 's summery bamboo and teak furniture , and was content . Mostly he allowed his land to grow wild , except for a small crop of butter-and-sugar corn famous for its sweetness . At the end of the summer , he held a party outdoors , a clambake with fresh corn , cold beer , and icy champagne . <br> Charlotte had seen Coop and Miranda about town now and then , when she went in to catch a movie or pick up a prescription at the pharmacy . It was obvious why any man would fall in love with Miranda Fellows . She was a dark-eyed beauty hired to run Luxe et VoluptT , an upscale clothing shop on Centre Street . She was British , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social-climbing set , men as well as women . She was such a snob , and Coop was such a genuine good guy , they seemed like an odd pair , but Charlotte had n't allowed herself romantic thoughts about Coop . <br> She had n't allowed herself romantic thoughts about any man for quite a long while . <br> Her own move to Nantucket had not been a lighthearted , impulsive act . She 'd thought about it a lot . She 'd searched her soul . She came to Nantucket to get away from men  --  at least from one particular man  --  and to somehow balance with good acts the wrong she 'd done . Her organic garden was her own self-imposed penance and repentance , and she 'd been diligent and hardworking and nunlike for three years . She did n't know when her penance would be over . . . but she knew she would find out when the time came . Until then , she forced herself to work hard , every day . <br> She stood up and stretched . On this June day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-sleeved T-shirt , a pair of striped bib overalls , and the floppy straw hat . She 'd been burned too many times after carelessly exposing her pale skin to the sun . She 'd learned her lesson . <br> Gardening seemed endlessly full of lessons , ones that had to be learned through personal experience instead of research and memorization . She liked that about working in a garden  --  the directness of it , the intimacy . It was so personal . No wonder people talked to their plants . Sometimes Charlotte sang to hers . And there was one stubborn wild rose , a rogue at the far end of the rows of winter onions , that had proudly kept a few green leaves all through the frigid winter . Charlotte actually visited it , touching its chilled leaves and whispering to it to cheer it on . When a failing plant began to thrive , she felt it as a personal victory ; she believed it was her good work that somehow brought about good results . <br> Now she scrutinized the long rows of plants shining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her part-time employee , was plucking weeds and tossing them into a bucket . Jorge was a good , fast worker , and she was lucky to have him , because hand weeding was backbreaking work and absolutely necessary for an organic garden . There were many positive aspects about growing lettuces on the island  --  lettuce liked sandy soil and cool weather , and Nantucket had plenty of both , even in the summer . And since her lettuces were harvested while they were still young , they were seldom in the soil long enough to develop insect and disease problems . But weeds were her nemesis . By U.S. Department of Agriculture standards , chemical weed killers could n't be used in an organic garden , and Charlotte did n't want to use them . The first year , she had tried to do everything herself , the seeding , planting , weeding , watering , and picking , in addition to taking the lettuces and other veggies to the various posh restaurants that would pay her prices for fresh locally grown produce , and at night she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes and for her records . She just had n't been able to do it all . Fortunately , Nona 's landscaper , who had tended her formal garden regularly for years , recommended Jorge , and Jorge had saved the day . <br> Jorge was weeding now and would weed most of the day . Charlotte ran down her mental list of duties . She wanted to plant more lettuces and arugula and , if she had time , pot the double impatiens people bought the instant they were available . She walked back to her work shed , trying hard not to think about Coop . <br> She would think about her family . That would provide sufficient distraction ! <br> Three years ago , she 'd presented her plan at Family Meeting and no one , not her brothers and not her cousins , had objected to Charlotte 's use of the roadside end of Nona 's land for a trial market garden . Even when she had the ground rototilled so that the familiar bronze tones of wild brush and grasses were transformed into shining rows of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil and manure that smelled to high heaven , even when men came to build an unattractive wire fence around the garden to keep out deer , rabbits , and other wildlife , and especially not when Charlotte contributed sweet fresh strawberries or crisp lettuces to the family meals , did anyone in the family object . <br> But last year Charlotte had made a profit of four thousand dollars , and suddenly everyone  --  well , her aunt and uncle and her cousins  --  was having fits of jealousy , claiming that Nona was giving more to Charlotte than to the rest of them . Which was crazy of them , because to them four thousand dollars was just nothing . <br> It was not the four thousand dollars , really , Charlotte knew , that was the issue . It was the whole property , land and house and beach , worth several million , that everyone wanted  --  and , rightfully , had a claim to . Nona was almost ninety ; she could n't live forever , even though everyone wished she might and Nona herself seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Charlotte 's father , Worth , and his sister , Grace  --  two in-laws  --  Charlotte 's mother , Helen , and Grace 's husband , Kellogg  --  six grandchildren , and  --  from Mandy , Grace 's daughter  --  two great-grandchildren . Nona had not , would not , disclose the details of her will , even though at each annual Family Meeting her children pressed her . When the time is right , she would respond , and it did n't matter if they claimed to be insulted , she would n't change her mind . <br> The three acres of land constituting Charlotte 's garden did n't belong to Charlotte . There had never been any kind of arrangement like that , and in fact Charlotte had insisted on paying a token rent to her grandmother for the use of the land . But no one in the family had ever expected her to stick with gardening ; they had all assumed that sooner or later Charlotte would think up some more appealing project and wander away , letting the acreage revert to its natural state . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grueling , dogged physical labor had paid off in unexpected ways . No one had expected her garden to be a success ; she could understand that completely . She 'd never been dedicated to anything before . <br> Continues ...
