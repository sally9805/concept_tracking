If you have been moody and sad , unable to eat or sleep , chances are you suffer from clinical depression  --  unless , of course , it 's just a bout of the blues . If you have a nasty habit of getting into brawls , chances are you are an antisocial personality  --  unless , of course , you are just a bit of a hothead . What determines whether you are sick or well ? Often as not , it 's whether you are male or female . <P> Diagnosing mental disorders has always been a tricky business , with doctors often relying on little more than observation , experience and the occasional hunch . Once the labels are applied , however , they stick , and medical texts tend to accept the results as truth  --  reporting , say , that two times as many women suffer from depression as men or that twice as many men suffer from alcoholism . Similarly , women are said to be more prone to anxiety disorders , while men may lean toward conditions stemming from impulsiveness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that makes one gender more vulnerable to some disorders than others ? Or does it have more to do with societal roles ? And if environment is the determining factor , will the illnesses that beset each sex change as society evolves ? <P> Researchers seeking to answer those questions come up against a confounding mess of variables  --  everything from changing hormone levels to a patient 's willingness to admit that a problem exists . But last summer a researcher at Stanford University tried to wave away some of the fog . Turhan Canli showed nearly 100 photographs  --  some of emotionally neutral objects like a fire hydrant , others of emotionally unsettling things like a severed hand  --  to 12 men and 12 women . Three weeks later he showed the subjects the same images and found that the women were 15% more likely to have accurately remembered the emotionally charged pictures than the men were . Brain scans produced by functional magnetic resonance imaging suggested why : the women stored both memory and the emotion linked with it in the same parts of the brain . The men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the memory into different spots within them . <P> If women are better integrated emotional organisms , that difference may begin in the womb , when estrogen and progesterone help shape the function and structure of the brain . " The hormones are very physiologic , " says Dr. Nada Stotland , professor of psychiatry at Rush Medical College in Chicago . " They have very measurable effects . " Similar hormonal surges later in life may have an equally profound impact , triggering higher rates of depression among women between puberty ( when estrogen starts to rise and fluctuate ) and menopause ( when the hormone is turned down low ) . Other  --  though less clear  --  physical differences may explain why boys are more likely than girls to develop such early-onset illnesses as autism . <P> But while biology is important , nobody discounts environment . Girls are taught early that the best way to manage feelings is to dredge them up and air them out . Boys are taught the value of suck-it-up silence .
