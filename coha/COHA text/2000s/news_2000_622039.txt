<p> When the remains of 13-year-old Christina Williams were discovered at the former Fort Ord Army base in January 1999 , residents in the city of Seaside thought the worst was over . <p> The grim news ended the months-long mystery of her whereabouts . The camera crews and reporters went home . At last , the Monterey Peninsula community was given time to heal . <p> But the haunting memories have returned as word spreads of the disappearance of a young Seaside woman . Tomorrow marks a month since 21-year-old Richelle Cherry , a fifth-generation Monterey County resident and mother of a 6-year-old boy , vanished under what police are calling suspicious circumstances . <p> " This town is n't that big , " said Cherry 's mother , Mary Jane Belanger . " Somebody has to have seen her . You do n't just go poof . " <p> Saying the community and media have been reluctant to get involved because Cherry is an adult , her relatives joined city officials at a news conference yesterday on the steps of Seaside City Hall to mobilize support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this incident is taking place , " Seaside Mayor Jerry Smith said . " We feel deeply for the family . It 's something that shocks the community as a whole and we will continue to utilize all police resources . We 're not going to give up . " <p> A stay-at-home mom , Cherry was last seen leaving her home in her car sometime between 10 a.m. and 10:45 a.m. on April 18 , after she had already made one round-trip to drop her son off at school . Neighbors also reported seeing a man who was known to visit the home walking from the house in the opposite direction , police said . <p> Cherry called her mother about 11 a.m. to tell her that she would pick her up for lunch in Monterey , according to Belanger . The frequent lunch dates had become a ritual for the two women , who live together in a modest one-story home about three blocks from the former Army base . <p> Cherry was often late , so Belanger said she was not terribly concerned when her daughter did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her hours later that Cherry had not picked up her son from school , Belanger started to worry , and on April 20 she notified police . <p> " She would never do this , " Belanger said . " I know my daughter . She would not just get up and go . " <p> On April 26 , eight days after Cherry was last seen , police found her car , a blue-green Nissan Sentra with a front fender smashed on the driver 's side . It was parked in a stall at an apartment complex about a half-mile from her house . <p> Police have no suspects in Cherry 's disappearance , according to Ron Long , one of two Seaside detectives assigned to the case . <p> Every day , investigators follow up on four or five tips that , so far , have yielded few results , Long said . <p> Nearly two weeks ago , authorities from across the state helped Seaside police search the city , coastal areas and Fort Ord , from the ground and the air , for signs of Cherry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it was in Christina Williams ' case , because Seaside investigators have not determined whether the case crosses state lines or whether Cherry was abducted , police said . However , the agency has offered assistance if necessary . <p> " I 've been concentrating on nothing but this case , " Long said . " And there really has n't been a whole lot . What 's most puzzling to me is that no one knows anything . " <p> Although police have been hesitant to say they suspect foul play , detectives and Cherry 's relatives are certain of one thing : The longer she is missing , the more likely it is she was the victim of a crime . <p> " We 're all on the same track . We 're all looking for somebody we all care for . We 've done a lot , but we need to do much more , " said Police Chief Fred Phillips . <p> Cherry rarely went to parties , and does not drink alcohol or use drugs , her mother said , although they shared a drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boyfriend , and she had very little contact with her son 's father , Belanger said . <p> But according to police , Cherry did have some contact with her son 's uncle , Treandous A. Cotton , whom police have questioned in the case . <p> In 1989 , Cotton , now 26 , was sentenced to 39 years to life in prison for stabbing an elderly man to death and then setting the man 's house on fire . Because he was a juvenile at the time , Cotton was sent to the California Youth Authority , where he was to be held until his 25th birthday . <p> Long would not provide details about the nature of Cherry 's relationship with Cotton . <p> " We have a pretty good idea of the relationship between him and her , but we 're not saying what kind of relationship , " Long said . <p> Belanger also did not want to talk about Cotton , but said he was not Cherry 's boyfriend . <p> " He did not live with us , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't really know anything about him . Richelle was n't involved with anyone . " <p> Marjorie Ingram Viales , Belanger 's cousin , said it has been difficult to muster the same kind of public support for Cherry  --  a woman who loved to wear blue jeans , and work with makeup and hair . <p> " It 's a little different because she 's 21 years old , " Viales said . " But to a mother , it does n't matter how young or old a child is . The reality is that someone 's child is missing . " <p> In Cherry 's neighborhood , residents say they know about the disappearance , but know little about the woman or her family . Throughout the city , white and yellow flyers with a description of Cherry have replaced those taped to shop windows after Christina 's abduction . <p> Christina , a seventh-grader with silky black hair , was abducted on June 12 , 1998 , while walking her dog on the former Fort Ord Army base . Four days later , the FBI released descriptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car . <p> Celebrities such as Mariah Carey helped bring the case national attention , and the FBI offered $100,000 to anyone who could lead them to the arrest and prosecution of Christina 's abductors . After a seven-month search for Christina , a botany researcher found her decomposed body not far from where she was last seen . <p> Authorities have yet to find those responsible for the girl 's death . Until last week , a composite sketch of the suspects was still tacked to a wall at the Seaside Police Department headquarters . It has been replaced by a flyer about Cherry . <p> Michael Williams , Christina 's father , has offered Cherry 's relatives his support . Bill Enders , a local motorcycle shop owner and president of Protect Our Kids Foundation , has started a reward fund for information about Cherry 's whereabouts . So far , the foundation , established after Christina 's abduction , has collected about $4,000 . <p> As the leads trickle into investigators , residents say they are bracing for what could be another tragedy . <p> When Mary Iracheta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard about Cherry , " I thought , Not another person missing . ' " <p> Tamara Bohannon , a Seaside resident and mother of two boys , said , " It 's frightening , but it 's becoming more common . I hope they find her . " <p> Seaside Police Sgt. Barry Pasquarosa said the legacy of the Christina Williams case has left a lasting impression on Seaside residents . <p> " People are becoming aware of the fragile aspect of life , " he said . " When things like this happen , it makes every thought possible go through your mind . People think about who is out there and who they know . " <p> For now , Belanger said , she has to stay focused for her daughter and her daughter 's son , whom she did not want to be identified . <p> " I have my good days and bad days , " Belanger said . " I try to keep busy , but at night at the house , that 's when it 's hard for me . But I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face and I have to be strong . "
