<p> As much as Milton Bradley would like you to think the company invented the board game , King Tut 's tomb says otherwise . When the ancient Egyptian king 's grave was opened in the 1920s , inside was a game board , playing pieces and even dice . That would make board games more than 3,000 years old . From then on , people played games of all kinds , over the years inventing such ultra- competitive mind-enhancers as checkers , backgammon and chess . And when the first settlers appeared on American shores , they brought board games that later occupied their children during the long treks across the country . Families that remember history are wise to repeat it . Research has shown that the family that plays together stays happier together . What games do for kids is well-documented . The right board games , including those that help build vocabulary and communication skills , can enhance math , reasoning and reading skills and teach problem-solving and logic . They can be a terrific extension of school-taught skills , with the bonus of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sportsmanship , creativity and interaction , and , as any parent who has been asked ' How are babies made ? ' during a Game of Life knows , sometimes the relaxed , intimate atmosphere allows unexpected questions and discussions to surface . But how to get a kid already addicted to video and other , more solitary , games excited about playing a board game u or ' bored ' game , as some see it u is another story . One possibility is to log on to www.million minutes.com , a website that came about four years ago when game company Patch Products came up with the idea to have a competition between states to see which one could spend the most time playing games . The event was such a success that the company plans to do it again this year , starting in September . It works this way : Families log their minutes playing games on the site , and at the end of the year , Patch announces the top five states . Last year 's winner was Washington ( hmmm , could weather have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California closely behind and New York a distant third . Colorado has always placed rather low ( hmmm , could weather have had anything to do with it ? ) . Another way to get kids ' attention is through snacks . Popcorn is a classic accompaniment to a night of game-playing , but snacks the kids help to make will be even more of a draw toward getting them to then sit down and play . Look for munchies that do n't make a huge mess , have broad appeal and are quick and easy to assemble . Cookies and milk , chips and dip , or veggies and ranch dressing are good options , or you can save dessert to have after dinner during the game . The recipes here have the added benefit of being simple to make and fun . And they 're tasty enough that , unlike the games found with King Tut , they wo n't be around for long .
