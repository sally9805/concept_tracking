Frank Nash was dead . Which is why it was such a surprise when I received his letter : <p> McKenzie : <p> You 're just the mug I need to help me get back my gold . <p> Think about it . <p> Jelly Nash <p> I checked the postmark . The letter had been mailed a day earlier , another surprise . Frank " Jelly " Nash might have been one of the nation 's most prolific bank robbers , pulling over a hundred successful jobs in a twenty- five- year career , but dead was dead , and since Nash had been shot in the head in 1933 , he was deader than most . Also , while I like to keep an open mind when it comes to the paranormal , somehow I was confident that if Nash wanted to speak to me from the grave , he would have chosen more efficient means than the U.S. Postal Ser vice . Still , there 's something about the word " gold " that captures the imagination , so as the letter writer requested , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning I received a second letter . <p> McKenzie : <p> I 'm planning a job worth millions . Do you want in ? <p> Jelly Nash <p> I did n't actually need the money , yet I had to ask  --  how many millions ? <p> Two days later , a Sunday , Nash sent an e-mail ; apparently he had an account with Comcast : <p> McKenzie : <p> The boys in St. Paul tell me you 're a mug who can <p> be counted on in a tight spot . Want to join my gang ? <p> Jelly Nash <p> I clicked the Reply button , wrote " I would never join a gang that would have me as a member , " and hit Send . <p> Twenty minutes later , the phone rang . <p> " Hello , McKenzie . It 's Ivy Flynn . " <p> " Ivy . How are you ? " <p> " I 'm really good . How ' bout yourself ? " <p> " Could n't be better . " <p> " McKenzie ? I 'm sorry to call you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a favor . " <p> Ivy was a graduate student in the Department of Entomology at the University of Minnesota , and about two years ago I had hired her to determine what was killing the honeybees owned by a close friend of mine . During the course of her research , someone took several shots at her with a twelve- gauge . <p> " I owe you one , " I said . " Tell me what you need . " <p> " It 's kinda complicated . Can we meet ? " <p> " Sure . " <p> We worked out the details . Afterward , I asked , " Ivy , do you know anything about some messages I 've been getting from Jelly Nash ? " <p> " That was my boyfriend 's idea . He thought they would pique your curiosity . " <p> " Did he actually use the word ' pique ' ? " <p> " Yes , sir . " <p> " Let me guess  --  English major . " <p> " American literature . He 's working on his Ph.D . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , sir . " <p> " Well , tell him the mug 's curiosity is indeed piqued . " <p> " I will . McKenzie ? This is going to be so much fun . " <p> " More fun than getting shot at ? " <p> She actually thought about it for a few beats before answering . " Yes , sir . Lots more . " <p> We agreed to meet at the same place we had met years earlier , Lori 's Coffee house on Cleveland Avenue across from the St. Paul campus of the University of Minnesota . I parked on Buford next to a small , classically designed Catholic church with arched stained glass windows , blond stone recovered from a church that was torn down decades earlier , and a peaked red tile roof . It was called the Church of St. Andrew Kim and served a congregation of Koreans . Before that it was called Corpus Christi ; the previous owners sold it to the Koreans when they moved to an ultramodern church with all the personality of a New Country Buffet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue Chevy Trailblazer was parked across the street from the church . The two men sitting inside had an unobstructed view of Lori 's front door . I might not have noticed them at all except for the still- burning cigarette butt that the driver flicked out the window . It joined three others in the street . Assuming he was a diligent chain- smoker , I decided he must have been parked there for at least thirty minutes . <p> Ivy and her companion were sitting at the same table as when I first saw her ; she could have been perched in the same chair . Even the paintings for sale on the walls looked familiar . While Lori 's had n't changed much , though , Ivy had . Twenty- four months ago I thought she was an attractive young woman hiding behind dowdy clothes , thick , large- rim glasses , and an unfortunate hairstyle . Well , she was n't hiding anymore . Irish red hair curled around her triangular face , setting off eyes that glistened like wet shamrocks . Her shirt was selected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too chilly to wear shorts in early May , but if I had legs like hers I would have worn them , too . <p> She came out of her seat for a hug . She was so happy to see me that she laughed out loud . I kissed her cheek and said , " You look fabulous . " <p> " You 've always been nice to me , " she said . <p> " Is this the boyfriend ? " <p> Her companion rose to his feet and extended his hand . " Josh Berglund , " he said like someone fond of reciting his own name . His appearance generated about as much excitement as a bowl of oatmeal  --  medium height and twenty pounds overweight , with straight brown hair , unremarkable hazel eyes , and a mustache that he should have given up on years ago . My first thought , Ivy could do a helluva lot better . <p> " Please , " he said and gestured at a vacant chair . <p> Two large mugs sat empty on the small square table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a lot of powdered sugar . <p> " How long have you been here ? " I asked . <p> " About a half hour , " Ivy said . <p> Berglund studied his watch . " Forty- two minutes , " he said . <p> It could n't be " about forty- five minutes , " my inner voice said . No , it has to be exactly forty- two minutes . C'm on , Ivy , what are you doing with this guy ? Still , the timing worked with the chain- smoker outside . <p> " So , what 's going on ? " I asked . <p> Berglund gestured at the mugs in front of us . " Can I get you something ? " " Sure . " " Mocha , latte , cappuccino , espresso , French soda  --  " " Coffee is fine . " He stared at me as if he had never heard of such a thing . " Black , " I added . " As you wish . Ivy ? " " Nothing else for me , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the counter . I turned to <p> Ivy . She reached across the table and squeezed my hand . " I am really glad to see you , " I said . " You look absolutely beautiful . " " Thank you . " " So , when did this Berglund happen ? Last time we chatted you were unattached and happy about it . " <p> " That 's what I said , but I did n't actually mean it . As for Josh , I 've known him on and off for a couple of years . We did n't start dating until three months ago . " <p> " Ahh . " <p> " Ahh  --  you sound like my brother . " <p> " Your brother goes ahh ? " <p> " Everyone I know goes ahh , especially when they 're about to tell me that I should be with someone who 's better- looking and has more money , but Josh is smart and generous and he 's kind to me and he makes me laugh . That 's a lot . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how she had been , and Ivy filled me in on the past six months  --  she was still going for her Ph.D . and expected to get it by the end of the term . A moment later , Berglund returned with the coffee . He set it in front of me and sat quietly while Ivy and I continued to exchange pleasantries . I was sure it annoyed him that I was holding hands with his girl ; I just did n't care . He seemed tired and uncertain , but that lasted only a few minutes . He gestured impatiently with an unexpected flash of energy . <p> " There are things we need to talk about , " he said . <p> " Yes , " Ivy said . " That 's why we 're here . " <p> I took a sip of the coffee . The house blend . Nice . Lori 's always served a good unadorned cup of joe . <p> " Okay , " I said . " I 'm primed . What 's your story ? " <p> " McKenzie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squeezed my hand for emphasis , then released it . <p> " No , " Berglund said . " Not need . " He glared at Ivy as if she had just tipped his hand in a high- stakes poker game . <p> She shrugged . " Why else did we call him ? " <p> He shook his head as if Ivy were discussing matters that were far beyond her grasp . I did n't like the gesture but let it slide . <p> " Why did you call me ? " I asked . <p> Berglund 's eyes went from me to Ivy to the ceiling and then back to me again . " Do you know who Jelly Nash was ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Jelly Nash was a bank robber who committed most of his crimes during the twenties and early thirties . " <p> " I know . " <p> " His real name was Frank Nash . He was born in the small town of Birdseye , Indiana , but he grew up in Oklahoma . His mother died when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care what I knew or did n't know . He had a story to tell and he was going to tell it his way and there was n't anything to do except lean back in the chair and listen . <p> " He was first arrested for burglary in 1911 ... " <p> I glanced at my watch several times , but if Berglund noticed , it did n't slow him down any . <p> " Nash was a meticulous planner . He spent many hours in the banks before he robbed them , drawing up detailed floor plans , noting the location of the safes as well as the movement of employees . Each robbery was timed . He and his gang would go in , stay for a specific number of minutes , then leave no matter how much loot had been collected . His escape routes were charted block by block . . . " <p> Finally I said , " You 're telling me this  --  why ? " <p> Irritation flashed across his face . Apparently he did n't like being interrupted . <p> " Approximately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank ' Jelly ' Nash stole thirty- two bars of gold bullion from the Farmers and Merchants Bank in Huron , South Dakota , " he said . " The gold has never been recovered . I believe it 's still here in St. Paul . " <p> " The gold was worth two hundred and sixty- four thousand dollars when Jelly stole it , " Ivy said . " At today 's prices , it would be worth  --  " <p> " Eight million , seven hundred sixty- six thousand , eight hundred eighty- eight dollars , " Berglund said . <p> I stared at him for a couple of beats while I digested the information . " I 'm sorry , " I said . " What were you saying ? " <p> " The gold had been en route to the Ninth District Federal Reserve Bank in Minneapolis for safekeeping , " Berglund said . He was smiling . He had a rapt audience now , and he knew it . " Prior to Franklin D. Roosevelt 's election in 1932 , gold was circulated freely in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private entities often maintained stores of bullion . In early 1933 , as part of the New Deal , Congress enacted a package of laws that criminalized private ownership of gold ; FDR himself signed Executive Order 6102 , which made the hoarding of gold an offense under the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 , literally an act of treason . All gold  --  coins , dust , bullion  --  was collected by the government and traded for other forms of money . The government had no single place to store it  --  the Federal Gold Repository at Fort Knox was n't built until 1936  --  so the gold was sent to the reserve banks and to the U.S. Mint in Denver and to any other place where it could be well protected . <p> " We believe Jelly Nash somehow learned about the shipment , which should n't come as a surprise . He had informants everywhere . He robbed the bank and got away with the gold as well as forty- six thousand dollars in cash . The theft was initially reported in the Huron Plainsman ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ county sheriff and a photograph of the safe Jelly had blown using nitroglycerin . Afterward , newspaper articles , as well as police reports , waxed extensively about the stolen forty- six thousand dollars , yet the gold was never again mentioned . " <p> " Perhaps the reporter made a mistake , " I said . " Goes to show , you should n't believe everything you read . " <p> Berglund shook his head . " I made use of the Freedom of Information Act to gain access to Treasury Department files , " he said . " There is no question that the gold theft took place as originally chronicled . However , authorities at the time deemed that it was in the public interest to keep news of it from broadly circulating . " <p> " Why ? " <p> " We can only speculate , " Berglund said . " There had been runs on several area banks during the months immediately preceding the theft . At the Security State Bank and Trust in Faribault , Minnesota , they had to literally stack money on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Bank of Grantsburg , Wisconsin , the parent bank flew in sacks of money and allowed customers to watch them deposit it in the bank 's vault . Possibly there was a fear that news of the gold theft would spark additional , more violent runs , especially since many people were incensed that the government was seizing privately owned gold supplies in the first place . We were in the middle of the Great Depression , and people trusted gold more than the government . <p> " Also , Minnesota 's financial community was lobbying heavily for a bank holiday , something that Governor Floyd B. Olson refused to sanction . Eventually Olson would give in , but at the time of the robbery , he may have thought that public outcry over the theft would produce pressure too great for him to weather , and it 's possible that he pulled strings to cover it up . " <p> " It would n't be the first time a politician believed that telling lies was in the public interest , " I said . <p> " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robbed the bank at 9:00 a.m. , immediately after it opened its doors to the public . Huron is three hundred thirty miles from St. Paul . Today , that 's a five- hour drive . Maybe less . In 1933 , it would have taken twice as long . Yet by nine that eve ning Nash was in St. Paul . The St. Paul Daily News reported that Nash and his wife , Frances , were seen carousing  --  that 's a direct quote from the newspaper  --  they were seen carousing with an architect named Brent Messer and his wife at the Boulevards of Paris nightclub . The newspapers loved to print gossip about gangsters in those days ; it was like they were celebrities . " <p> " So you believe Frank came straight here after the heist . " <p> " I do . And why not ? For nearly thirty years , St. Paul had been a refuge for gangsters , a safe harbor for killers , bank robbers , stickup artists , kidnappers , bootleggers , extortionists  --  criminals of every variety and stature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; authorities even afforded them protection from other law enforcement entities as long as they refrained from committing crimes within the city limits . " <p> A simple yes would have sufficed , my inner voice said . <p> " They called it the O'Connor System , named after Chief of Police John  --  " " I know all this , " I said . " It 's my town . " Ivy flashed a look of disapproval . Still , the interruption slowed <p> Berglund down for a moment . <p> " I 'm just trying to give you context , " he said . He slowly drained the cold coffee that had pooled at the bottom of his mug before beginning again . " Jelly and Frances Nash were at the nightclub on the eighth . By perusing FBI rec ords , we discovered that they spent the night of June ninth with Alvin Karpis and the sons of Ma Barker at their hideaway on Vernon Street in St. Paul . We know that they departed the following day , the tenth . " <p> " Abruptly is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't have the gold with him when he left , " Berglund said . <p> " How do you know ? " I asked . <p> " Nash was a different breed of criminal than most that flourished during those days . Yes , he was a thief , but he also was a comparatively honorable man . I believe that it is unlikely that he would have put his wife at risk by transporting her and the stolen gold in the same vehicle . That , of course , is merely conjecture on my part . However , it is supported by the fact that Nash did not have the gold with him when he was apprehended by federal agents six days later in Hot Springs , Arkansas . " <p> " You think it 's still in St. Paul , " I said . <p> " Yes . The nine minutes Nash spent inside the Farmers and Merchants Bank triggered a massive manhunt . Treasury agents searched for the thieves and the thirty- two gold bars for many years . Yet no one was ever arrested for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is in the Treasury Department 's own files . " <p> " Wait a minute . When Frank was arrested , it was n't for the gold robbery ? " <p> " No . " <p> " If the Treasury Department knew Frank robbed the bank  --  " <p> " It did n't know . That 's something we developed on our own . " <p> " He was n't identified at the scene ? " <p> " No one was identified . Witnesses claim the thieves wore masks . " <p> " Then how do you know Frank committed the robbery ? " <p> " His fingerprints were all over it . " <p> " He was identified by his fingerprints ? " <p> " No . What I meant by fingerprints  --  that was a metaphor . What I meant , the way the crime was executed , the way the vault was blown using nitroglycerin , the short amount of time spent in the bank , the escape route  --  it all fit Nash 's MO , his modus operandi . " <p> " I know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling me that there is n't a shred of evidence placing Frank in that bank . You do n't actually know that he stole that gold . This is mere speculation . " <p> " The facts fit , " Berglund said . <p> " The facts could be made to fit anybody . Hell , it could have been Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid . " <p> " They were dead by then . " <p> " Nonetheless , " I said . <p> I took a long pull on my coffee while Berglund stared into his empty mug . Ivy took his hand and looked at him with a deep kindness that made me jealous . <p> " I believe , " Ivy said . <p> " So do I , " Berglund said . <p> " That makes two of you , " I said . <p> " I believe Nash stole the gold , " Berglund said . " I believe he hid it somewhere in St. Paul with the intention of fencing it or moving it once it cooled down , only his arrest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been patiently waiting all these years for whoever can find it . " <p> " Assuming he did steal the gold  --  and that 's a big assumption  --  what do you think he did , bury it in his backyard ? " <p> " Why not ? Many people at the time  --  legitimate citizens  --  refused to give up their gold , choosing to hoard it instead until the price controls were lifted and they could sell it for considerably more than what the government was paying . Some of them did indeed bury it in their backyards . " <p> " What do you want from me ? " <p> " We want you to help us find the backyard . Ivy says you 're an investigator . " <p> " In a manner of speaking . " <p> " She says you know how to find things . " <p> " If it 's worth it to me . " <p> " We 'll give you a fair share of the gold . " <p> " How fair ? " <p> " A third . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third of $8,766,888 amounts <p> to $2.9 million and change . Yeah , that sounded fair . On the other hand , a third of nothing is nothing . " Why me ? " I asked . " Based on the research you 've already done , you <p> certainly seem to know what you 're doing . Why come to me for help ? " " Assuming you agree to accept our offer , what would you do first ? " " If this were 1933 , we 'd try to reconstruct Frank 's movements during those days he was here  --  interview all of his known associates , visit all of his haunts , and like that . Unfortunately , this is n't 1933 . This is the coldest of cold cases . Most people who witnessed the actual events are likely long dead . Those who are n't were probably too young at the time to be of much help to us . That limits us to police records , newspaper reports , historical references  --  " <p> " I would n't have thought of that . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 're a smart guy . " I glanced at Ivy when I said that , but I did n't mean anything by it . I still thought she could do better . <p> " You overestimate me , " Berglund said . <p> " Probably , " I said , but I did n't believe it . There was something else that Berglund wanted , and I thought I knew what it was . " McKenzie , will you help us ? " Ivy asked . " Well , I 'll tell you , kid . I 'm inclined to say no . I 'm inclined to tell <p> you that this is the wildest of wild goose chases , and if the gold had been hidden in St. Paul  --  if Frank had even stolen it in the first place  --  somehow someone would have found it in the past seventy- five years . <p> I 'm impressed that you believe that it exists , though . I 'm even more impressed by the two guys sitting in the blue Trailblazer across the street watching us who also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to look out the window . <p> " Do n't act surprised , " I said . " They 're the real reason you called me . <p> Is n't that right ? " " I did n't know they were here , " Berglund said . " You said we lost them , " Ivy said . " I thought we had . " " Who are they ? " I asked . " I do n't know . " " That 's no way to start a partnership , telling fibs . " " I swear , Mr. McKenzie , I have no idea who they are . " Berglund turned to Ivy , looking for support . " No idea at all . " " It 's true , McKenzie , " Ivy said . The anxiety in her voice was almost heartbreaking . " They just , they just appeared . " " When ? " " About a week ago . They 've been following us  --  everywhere . " " When I try to talk to them , they just drive away , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , there they are . " " They 're waiting for you to lead them to the gold , " I said . " Who else <p> did you tell about it ? " " No one , " Berglund said . " You told someone . " I glanced at Ivy . She shook her head . " A friend ? " I said . " No , " Berglund said . " Family member ? " " No . " " Someone you 've been in contact with while doing your research ? " " No one . We 've been very discreet . " <p> " Yet there they sit . " <p> Berglund opened his mouth to defend himself , but I flung a thumb in the general direction of the front window and he thought better of it . <p> " So what you really want is for me to watch your back while you search for Jelly 's gold , " I said . <p> " No , I . . . " Berglund turned to Ivy , looking for more assistance . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of mine . " More than that , I hope , " she said . <p> I might have read a lot of extra meaning into the gesture if it came from someone else , but I knew her and she knew me . I was the uncle she counted on when she could n't turn to Mom and Dad . The realization made me sad . When did I stop being attractive to young women , I wondered . <p> When were you ever attractive to young women ? my inner voice replied . <p> " Please help us , " Ivy said . <p> Her pleading eyes , the expectant expression on her face  --  I closed my own eyes . When I opened them again she was still staring at me . All I can say is , I 'm lucky she was n't selling time- share condos in Florida . <p> " Sure , " I said . <p> They both seemed relieved , and for a moment I wondered just how much trouble they were really in that they had n't told me about yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I asked . They seemed insulted by the question . " Do you know where Rickie 's is ? " <p> " The jazz joint on Summit Hill ? " Berglund said . <p> " That 's the place , only do n't call it a joint ; the owner does n't like it . I want you to give me a good five minutes , then go to your car and drive south on Cleveland until you reach Como Avenue . After that , I do n't care how you get to Rickie 's , just go . " <p> " What are you going to do ? " Ivy said . <p> " Make sure that the guys in the Trailblazer really are following you , then find out who they are . " <p> " How ? " Berglund asked . <p> " There are ways . " <p> " Then what ? " Berglund said . <p> " Are you going to shoot them ? " Ivy said . <p> " What a bloodthirsty young lady you 've become since I saw you last . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm not going to shoot anyone . Let 's <p> be clear about that , kids . No guns , all right ? " They nodded . " I mean it . " They nodded some more . Still , I do n't think they believed me . " Okay , " I said . I stood and splayed the fingers of my hand . " Five minutes . Then go to Rickie 's . I 'll meet you there . " <p> Berglund stood , took keys from his pocket that were on a chain with a USA Olympic emblem . Ivy remained seated . Her eyes sparkled as she looked up at me . <p> " Seems like old times , does n't it ? " I said . <p> Her smile matched her eyes , and she nodded in agreement . <p> Excerpted from Jelly 's Gold by David Housewright . Copyright 2009 by David Housewright ..
