George Bush and John McCain share a peculiar habit : they often introduce their fathers as a way of introducing themselves  --  even before they mention their wives , their children or the reason they are running for President . With Bush , the resemblance is so uncanny , his face does all the talking , even before he reminds you of how he got it . " When it comes to picking parents , " he likes to say , " I did a fabulous job . " McCain for his part presents his best-selling book as his coat of arms : Faith of My Fathers , he says , is the story of three generations of flawed men who found redemption in the service of their country . Now he is calling on voters to join him for one last mission . <P> One father waits in the wings , obsessed with his son 's crusade , dreaming of restoration ; the other lies buried in Arlington National Cemetery . But both men are eternally present in this race . In the Bush and McCain clans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at birth , resented in adolescence like hair that wo n't lie flat or legs too short for basketball . Each generation seemed to raise the stakes ever higher . McCain , whose family traces its martial roots back to Charlemagne , entered the Navy as the son and grandson of four-star admirals . Bush , whose family is distantly connected to the Queen of England , entered national politics the son of a President and grandson of a Senator . Both men were raised by absent fathers and strong mothers and delight in recounting their rebellion against the impossible standards they faced , even as they walked in their fathers ' footsteps like children leaping from one large bootprint to the next in deep snow . <P> Those journeys in long shadows are the scrapbook of this race . " Oh , Dad , " McCain said wistfully , looking out the window of his bus last Friday , when asked what his father would have thought about this moment . " To be candid , he would n't understand . He was a military man from the time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day he left the Navy . So I 'm sure he would be proud , but I think there would be some of it he would just not feel familiar with . " Bush does n't have that problem . His father knows all about life-and-death politics  --  and so does the son . <P> As he said last week , " I 'm a warrior for my dad . " <P> For all the echoes in the McCain and Bush family legacies , one difference screams out as the two men fight their way toward the White House . McCain is eternally willing to talk about his father and grandfather and the burdens and advantages that came with his birthright ; he throws credit their way like garlands . In the Bush universe , the subject is a private matter . Indeed , even as he honors his father and worships his example , George W. Bush never misses a chance to insist that what he has accomplished he has done on his own , by his own efforts and talents and grit . He touts his record as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflected the financial backing of his father 's friends and their desire to be associated with the Bush name . And he stakes his claim to the presidency based on his record as Governor of Texas , even though the fat war chest and thick stack of endorsements may owe something to his birth certificate as well as his resume .
