<p> Brad Warrick is always talking to his elementary school students about two things . One is football , a sport he played when he was in school . The other is birds . <p> Birds have fascinated Mr. Warrick ever since he was a boy . One day he was watching a bird with a red eye rummaging in the brush . He opened his field guide and found a picture that matched it . It was a rufous-sided towhee . " I was so excited about being able to identify it myself , " Warrick says . Now he 's been on birding trips to 30 countries and seen more than 2,250 of the world 's 10,000-plus bird species . <p> " He 's amazing , " says Andy Van Noy , an eighth-grader in Warrick 's private one-room school in Big Oak Valley , Calif . " He can identify birds without binoculars or a bird book - from five miles away ! " he adds , exaggerating just a little . <p> Today Warrick is taking the class on a bird walk on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm , sunny day in a week . The class is hoping to see some spring " migrants , " birds flying north for the summer . Fifth-grader Ariana Dale is eager to see something else - something in a nesting box Warrick put up in late winter . He asked her to keep track of it . <p> The kids step outside equipped with field guides , binoculars , and checklists of birds to look for . Within seconds Warrick spots the first bird : a tree swallow . Swallows eat only flying insects , he explains . So after the cold , wet weather , these birds desperately need to feed their chicks . Ariana hopes the sun has come in time . <p> ' Do n't forget our garbage cleaners ' <p> Warrick sets up his spotting scope - a telescope on a tripod that magnifies birds 20 to 60 times . The kids take turns looking through it . They see a flash of turquoise on the bird 's black feathers . So why is the tree swallow in their field guides blue ? <p> " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warrick explains . <p> The class spots a female Anna 's hummingbird and lesser goldfinches at a feeder . Then , " Quick ! " Warrick says . " There 's a beautiful western kingbird in that tree ! " The kids rush to take a look , find it in their field guides , and check it off their lists . " Make sure you see it , " Warrick says , " because part of the fun is seeing how pretty it is . <p> " And do n't forget our garbage cleaners , " he says , sweeping his arm over the valley where large birds are soaring in circles . They 're turkey vultures , and they eat the flesh of dead animals ( carrion ) . They can smell carrion up to seven miles away . The vultures are very efficient fliers . They roost in trees until the morning sun warms the earth . Then they spread their wings and let thermals ( rising currents of warm air ) carry them effortlessly upward . Because they can fly using so little energy , they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , but does n't get very far . Warrick has spotted a black-chinned hummingbird . <p> " It 's in the scope ! " he shouts , his voice rising . " Ellen , use your binoculars ! " he says . " If he turns his head , you 'll see a beautiful violet . " <p> Next the class walks down through a huge field , watching out for rattlesnakes . <p> " Can I check my nesting box ? " Ariana asks . <p> " On the way back , " Warrick says . He is searching the field for a flash of brilliant blue . He wants to get a male western bluebird in the scope . <p> Soon someone spots one sitting on a rock about 50 yards away . " OK , scopers ! " Warrick calls . " Is n't that a gorgeous bird ? " Warrick has seen the most beautiful birds in the world - quetzals in Costa Rica and birds of paradise on the island of New Guinea , north of Australia . But he gets just as excited over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a breeze ruffles his spectacular , royal-blue feathers . <p> Warrick 's ear is as keen as his eye . " Oh ! A western kingbird is taking food to its nest in the gutter of our house , " he says . " I just heard its call . " Then he hears another bird that has just returned from wintering in Mexico or Central America : an ash-throated flycatcher . " Listen ! " Warrick says . " His call sounds like ' Quick ! Three bricks ! ' " Everyone is quiet . <p> " I heard it ! " says a surprised student . <p> The ' Tyrannosaurus Rex ' of the air <p> Warrick teaches his class lots of interesting things : The cooper 's hawk is " the T-Rex of birds . " No bigger than a crow , it flies so fast and turns so sharply that it catches birds that larger hawks ca n't . The red-breasted sapsucker eats insects as well as sap . By pecking trees until sap runs , it attracts insects to eat . Wrens are secretive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a dead tree with hundreds of holes up and down its trunk . Ben Davis picks up an acorn shell . It is the same size as the holes on the tree . Warrick explains that an acorn woodpecker stored acorns in the tree for his winter food . <p> On the way back to the classroom the group passes a tree swallow nest . " They 'll dive bomb us ! " says Chris Dale , a seventh-grader who likes warplanes . But today they do n't . Chris thinks swallows are cool . <p> The bird walk is almost over . Warrick was hoping to spot a special bird called a phainopepla , a black bird with a crest . " This is where I usually see him , " he says , " but he 's not performing for me today . " Birding is like fishing , he says . You 're not guaranteed to catch a big fish - or to see a special bird . But it 's fun to try . <p> ' Now I think birds are pretty cool ' <p> Everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The wind flattens the grasses in waves that fly across the field . The bluebird chicks in Ariana 's box hatched before the bad weather . Are they still OK ? The first bluebird brood of the year ( they have two broods each season ) has a low survival rate . Still , she has hope . <p> Ariana is n't tall enough to see inside the nesting box , hung on a tree trunk . Eighth-grader Chris Greiner approaches the box . <p> " Are they moving ? " Warrick asks . <p> Chris does n't answer right away . " One 's moving , " he says . Ariana shoots her fists into the air . A big smile lights her face . <p> " They 're all moving , " Chris adds . Ariana jumps up and down . <p> " That 's such a relief ! " she says . <p> Back in the classroom , the kids are supposed to be doing math . But field guides and checklists - with about 20 birds checked off - linger on their desks . <p> " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixth-grader Jonathon Greiner says . " But now I think they 're pretty cool . They have cool lives , and are interesting to watch . " <p> With a mentor like Brad Warrick , any kid can find out just how cool birds are . <p> How to get started watching <p> 1 . Find a mentor . It 's no fun to spend time looking for birds and not see many . Or to see them but not know what they are . That 's why teacher and birder Brad Warrick recommends hunting for birds with an experienced birder . <p> Maybe you know someone like that already . If not , do n't worry . Ask your mom or dad to take you on a bird walk sponsored by your local Audubon Society . ( A list of local chapters is at : www.audubon.org . ) Leaders of these walks love to welcome new birders . They may take you under their wing . <p> 2 . Get a field guide and binoculars . There are lots of field guides to birds . For children 7 and up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of North America " ( St. Martin 's Press , $ 15.95 ) . The guide 's range maps tell you if a bird lives near you . Get a checklist of birds in your area from your local Audubon Society . Read up on some of those birds in your field guide before you go birding . Notice the " field marks " that will help you identify those birds . <p> If you can , get some binoculars . The ones best for birding are 7 X 35 or 8 X 40 . ( The first number is the magnification : 7 or 8 times . The second number is the diameter of the front lens in millimeters . The bigger the lens , the brighter the image . ) <p> 3 . Start a list . Every time you go on a bird walk , take a journal with you to keep track of birds you see . Write down where you saw each bird , the date , what the bird was doing , and any other interesting things about your experiences . If you like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 4 . Observe birds in your yard . Once you 've had some experience , try identifying some birds on your own at home . Learn their songs or calls . Put up bird feeders and a nesting box or two , perhaps . ( Many birds have a second brood in the summer , so it 's not too late to attract a nesting pair . ) You 'll love seeing eggs and then chicks in the nest . Do n't bother the birds too often , though . I recommend Stokes backyard nature books ( www.StokesBooks.com ) as a resource . The books can tell you all you need to know about attracting birds and providing for their needs . <p> 5 . Branch out . Sign up for a class on birding at a nature center .
