Christmas was coming , and I had killed a man . <br> Either of those facts was enough to make me want to stay in bed and pull the covers over my head for a long , long time . <br> Not to mention the fact that I was having feelings for two men , when I 'd never expected or wanted to love even one man again , ever . <br> Not to also mention the fact that I 'd agreed to take care of an unknown freewheeling iguana today . <br> It was all too much for any one person , especially this person . I figured I had every right to put the brakes on my life and refuse to go on . To just stand up and yell , " Okay , time out ! No more life for me for a while . I 'll get back to you when I 'm ready . " <br> Instead , I crawled out of bed at 4 a.m. , just like I do every friggin ' morning , and gutted up to face whatever the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming as I do from a long line of people who just keep on keeping on , even when anybody in their right mind would step aside for a while . <br> I 'm Dixie Hemingway , no relation to you-know-who . I 'm a pet sitter on Siesta Key , which is a semitropical barrier island off Sarasota , Florida . Until almost four years ago , I was a deputy with the Sarasota County Sheriff 's Department . My husband was a deputy too . His name was Todd . We had a beautiful little girl . Her name was Christy . We were happy in the way of all young families , aware that bad things happened to other people but blocking out how exquisitely tenuous life really is . That all changed in a heartbeat . Two heartbeats , actually  --  the last of Todd 's and Christy 's . <br> I 've read somewhere that excavators in Siberia found an intact woolly mammoth that had been entombed in ice for millennia . A butterfly was on the mammoth 's tongue . I think about that woolly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One second you can be blissfully standing in golden sunshine with butterflies flitting around you , and the next second  --  whap !  --  the world goes dark and you 're totally alone and frozen . <br> I went a little bit crazy when that happened to me . To tell the truth , I went more than a little crazy . My rage was so great that the Sheriff 's Department wisely decided that sending me out in public with a gun on my belt was like dropping a piranha in a goldfish bowl . But grief held too long eventually becomes a memorial to yourself , and you have to let it go . <br> When I was able to function again , I became a pet sitter . I like pets and they like me , and I 'm not often in situations where I might revert to the old fury that buzzed in my veins for so long . I ca n't say I 'm completely free of either the grief or the craziness that goes with it , but I 'm a lot better . <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> Not that he did n't need killing . He did , and the grand jury agreed that he did . Actually , they agreed that I had killed him in self-defense and that it was a damn good thing I had , given the awful things he had done and would have done again , but that did n't change the fact that I have to live with knowing I 've killed somebody . <br> Killing changes a person . Ask any combat veteran responsible for enemy deaths . Ask any cop who 's had to take out a criminal . You can justify it , you can know that it was your job , that it was necessary , and that you 'd do it again in the same circumstance , but it still changes you , even if nobody else knows it . <br> That , plus the fact that Christmas would be here in exactly twelve days , was causing me to avoid almost all human contact . <br> In my line of work , avoiding human contact is actually pretty easy . If a pet client @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we sign a contract and make sure everybody understands exactly what I will and will not do . I 'm pretty much a pushover when it comes to pets , so I 'll do whatever they need , but I try not to let the humans know that right up front . They give me a key to their house and a security code number if they have an alarm system , show me their pet 's toys and favorite hiding places , and tell me what they want done in the event they both die while they 're away . Living in a retirement mecca where the majority of the inhabitants are over the age of sixty-five makes that an issue that comes up more frequently than you 'd think . Sometimes it 's the other way around ; they tell me what they want done with the pet in the event it dies while they 're away . That also happens more frequently than you 'd think . Once we 've all made sure we 're in accord about what 's best for the pet , they leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until they return . <br> That 's my modus operandi and it 's practically set in stone . The fact that I 'd deviated so much from it when I agreed to take care of an iguana that day was a mystery . His owner had called the night before and talked me into taking the job even though he was n't one of my regular clients , and even though it is absolutely against my professional standards to take on a pet without first meeting both pet and owner . We 'd had a bad connection and I 'd had to strain to hear him . To this day , I 'm not exactly sure what he said that was so persuasive  --  the husky Irish accent , maybe , not full-blown faith-and-begorra Irish but with enough of a lilt to make my mouth want to smile . Or maybe it was just that I have a soft spot in my heart for iguanas because my grandfather had one . <br> I said , " The iguana is in a cage ? " <br> " No , no , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> I nodded at the phone . My grandfather had felt the same way . <br> He said , " Somebody will be there to let you in . All you have to do is put out fresh vegetables . He dotes on yellow squash , and there 's some romaine and red chard . I 'm forever in your debt for doing this , miss . Leave me a bill and I 'll get a check off to you the instant I get home . " <br> " You want me to go just the one time ? " <br> " Yes , that 's all . Oh , and this is very important  --  his name is Ziggy . Zig-ee . " <br> He gave me his address on Midnight Pass Road and rang off before I could get a phone number . When I looked at the notes I 'd scrawled , they were pathetic . I 'd written Ken Curtis ( ? ) Vegs Yellow sqsh Ziggy . <br> Except for the address , that was it . I had n't even verified the caller 's name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't sure I 'd caught it right . I pride myself on handling my business in a professional manner , but any half-assed amateur could have handled that call better . I consoled myself that it would be an easy twenty bucks . Iguanas do n't have to be walked or groomed , so all I 'd have to do was put out some veggies for him and I 'd be out in no time . <br> The weather for the last few days had been what Southwest Floridians call cold and wintry , meaning night temperatures had dipped into the high fifties , and the days ' highs hovered just below seventy . For tourists and seasonal snowbirds , the cold weather was a major disappointment . For thin-blooded year-round locals like me , it was an aberrant misery . <br> My apartment is above a four-stall carport , with a long covered porch running its length . The porch faces the Gulf of Mexico , where time and capricious tides have carved a narrow hiccup of beachfront property that shifts and transforms itself every few months , making it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened the French doors that morning and stepped out on the porch , it was so chilly I could see my breath in the pale light of a coconut sky . Rain clouds were building purple mountains over the Gulf , but they looked several hours away . At least that 's what I told myself when I decided to take my bike instead of the Bronco . The truth is that at that pre-dawn hour , when the birds are still sleeping in the palms , oaks , pines , and sea grape , I feel invincible on my bike , gliding down empty streets and breathing in the salty air as if I were a bird myself . <br> Siesta Key is eight miles long , north to south , with one main thoroughfare named Midnight Pass Road . Sarasota Bay lies on our east side , and the Gulf of Mexico is on the west . Two drawbridges connect us to Sarasota , each with a bathroom-sized bridge house where a tender pushes buttons and flips switches to open the bridge when a boat needs to pass through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one boat , but if several boats sail through , it takes a lot longer . One of our favorite bitch topics is how long we had to wait for a sailboat to pass , but the bridges also make for great excuses for being late to appointments . All we have to say is , " The bridge was up , " and people roll their eyes and groan in understanding . <br> About seven thousand permanent people call the key home , but during the season , from October to May , our population swells to around twenty-four thousand . Except for times when our streets are clogged with sun-bemused snowbirds , tourists , or carousing students on spring break , we 're a fairly laid-back bunch . <br> I live near the south end so I always begin the day working my way north , just taking care of dogs . Dogs ca n't wait for you the way other pets can . Once all the dogs have been walked and fed and groomed , I retrace my route and call on the pets who do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guinea pigs and birds . Not snakes . I do n't take care of snakes . I 'm not exactly snake-phobic , but it makes me go swimmy-headed to hold a squirming little mouse above a gaping snake 's mouth , so I refer those jobs to other pet sitters . <br> No matter who else is on my daily list of calls , I always start with Billy Elliot . Billy 's a former racing greyhound who lives with Tom Hale in the Sea Breeze condos . Tom 's a CPA whose spine was crushed a few years ago when a wall of lumber at a home-improvement store fell on him . Then , to make his misery complete , his wife left him and took their children and most of their possessions . Eventually , Tom got his act together , moved into the Sea Breeze , and started doing whatever it is that CPAs do at his kitchen table . He and I trade services . I go by twice a day and run with Billy Elliot , and Tom handles anything having to do with me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tom was about as closed off from the world as I was , but when I got to his condo that morning , there was a big Christmas wreath on his door . It was n't just a generic wreath , either , but a customized affair with a sassy red velvet bow and a toy greyhound perched above a nest of gilded pinecones . I stood a moment gaping at the thing before I unlocked the door and let myself into the dark foyer where Billy Elliot was nervously prancing on the tile floor . We kissed hello , I clipped the leash on his collar , and we slipped out of the apartment as quietly as thieves . On the ride down in the elevator , I considered asking him what had possessed Tom to have such a fancy wreath made for his door , but I thought it might hurt Billy Elliot 's feelings , seeing as his facsimile was the focal point of the wreath . <br> We ran tippy-toe across the downstairs lobby and went outside to the parking lot for our run . Billy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on selected bushes until we come to the oval track encircled by parked cars , and then stretch out and run like hell , full out , galloping like crazy , just like when he was a young dog chasing a mechanical rabbit while crowds cheered and bet money on him . Except this time he had a wheezing blond human slowing him down because her thigh muscles were n't nearly as strong as his . When he had finally run out all his nervous energy and I was about to fall over from breathing so hard , we ran at a slower pace back to the Sea Breeze 's front door . <br> A woman with a corgi on a short leash was just coming out , and we stood aside while they passed . The woman nodded , but the corgi was embarrassed on account of wearing a pair of miniature deer antlers and an ermine-trimmed red velvet jacket , so he kept his head averted . Billy Elliot and I exchanged a can-you-believe-that ? look , but we did n't let on how dorky we thought it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen , and the lights were on in Tom 's living room . I had n't noticed it before , but there was a lavishly decorated Christmas tree in the corner . Now that I knew it was there , I could smell it , too , a pleasant balsam odor . My gosh , not only a wreath but a real Christmas tree ! Tom and I do n't always talk when I pop in and out of his apartment , but you 'd think something like plans to buy a Christmas tree would have come up at least once . I wondered how he 'd managed to get the top ornaments on . To tell the truth , I felt a little put out that he had n't asked me to help him . I mean , I did n't want a tree of my own , but if he wanted to have one I would have been happy to help him with it . <br> I yelled toward the kitchen , " Morning , Tom ! Nice tree ! " <br> He wheeled into the living room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of curly black hair looking slept on . Instead of his usual sloppy sweats , he wore a snazzy red velour bathrobe . He looked a little bit like the corgi . <br> I said , " Wow , you 've really got the Christmas spirit , do n't you ? " I could hear the little defensive whine in my voice , but I could n't do anything about it . <br> He grinned even wider and made some inarticulate sounds that sounded like he was trying to deny it and claim it at the same time . Clinking sounds came from the kitchen , the sounds of mugs being removed from a cupboard , and a silky woman 's voice called , " Darlin ' , did you ask me something ? " <br> Oh . Now I understood . Tom had n't been hit by the Christmas spirit , he 'd been hit by romance . And he had n't told me . He had n't said , " Hey , Dixie , I 've got a woman in my life now , so when you come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <br> For some reason , that made me vaguely angry , which was stupid , because Tom 's personal life was n't any of my business , and I was actually glad that he had a girlfriend after being alone for so long . But I was still sulky at the change in him . <br> I said , " Oh , excuse me , " and beat a fast retreat , knowing all the time that Tom would feel bad at the way I acted , but not able to do anything about that , either . I did n't even hang Billy Elliot 's leash in the hall closet before I left , just left it sloppily looped over the arm of a chair . <br> The nasty truth was that I was jealous . Not like a woman jealous that another woman is with a man she wants , but jealous that Tom had found the strength to let his old love go and be happy with somebody new . I was n't sure I 'd ever be able to do that , and I was afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Copyright 2008 by Blaize Clement . All rights reserved . <br> <br> Continues ...
