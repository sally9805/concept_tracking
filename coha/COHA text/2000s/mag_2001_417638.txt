In my nutrition practice I have seen countless patients with brain injuries . These injuries can be a result of car , motorcycle , bicycle or skiing/ snowboarding accidents , or even from domestic or crime-related violence . Brain injuries are reaching epidemic proportions in America . Sadly , most patients with brain injuries do not realize that optimal nutrition can often make a difference in their recovery . They are even told often by well-meaning physicians that there is nothing they can do to improve their brain function . Not so . Brain nutrients for head trauma patients is one of the most exciting applications of optimal nutrition I have seen in my 15 years of practice . But let me make one thing very clear : optimal nutrition is not going to cure anyone from a brain injury . However , in a time of trauma , or even years after the trauma , it only makes sense to feed the brain as optimally as possible . The results will vary from mild to striking improvement in mental function . Of all of the nutrients needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important and best studied is acetyl-L-carnitine . Why Acetyl-L-Carnitine ? Acetyl-L-carnitine is a special form of carnitine that has the particular ability to optimize brain function . Acetyl-L-carnitine is able to cross into the brain more effectively than regular carnitine . It therefore enhances brain cell function much better than regular carnitine . As we age , acetyl-L-carnitine levels in our brains go down and for optimal brain function , supplements of acetyl-L-carnitine become mandatory . Particularly for those over 40 , acetyl-L-carnitine is the preferred form of carnitine . The research on acetyl-L-carnitine shows it to be nothing short of extraordinary . Acetyl-L-carnitine prevents the deterioration of the brain during stress and it helps the aging brain function better . Acetyl-L-carnitine also helps prevent damage that can occur to nerve cells when there is a lack of oxygen in the brain . It is therefore of no surprise that acetyl-L-carnitine is very helpful for stroke victims , who have been found to recover better on 1500 mg of acetyl-L-carnitine per day . Acetyl-L-carnitine acts in many ways to prevent the deterioration of brain cells that normally happens with age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a powerful antioxidant , provides the brain with healing energy and increases levels of a very important messenger molecule called acetylcholine . It is acetylcholine which becomes deficient in the brains of Alzheimer 's patients and that is why these patients have such poor memory function . So by increasing levels of acetylcholine , acetyl-L-carnitine helps the memory work better and may help prevent Alzheimer 's as well . Animal studies have shown that acetyl-L-carnitine can greatly improve the body 's ability to recover and repair nerves after physical trauma . Acetyl-L-carnitine is an exciting nutrient for application in any kind of nerve damage because it is a real " Renaissance nutrient " when it comes to healing nerves . The many roles acetyl-L-carnitine plays in promoting nerve healing include : promoting the growth and health of nerve cells in many ways accelerating the maturation of nerve cells protecting nerve cells from free radicals activating nerve growth factor , an important nerve cell healing compound made by the body speeding the healing of damaged nerves in peripheral neuropathies Helping Kim , who was in a car accident A woman we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a car accident . She had been rear-ended by a teenager looking at his girlfriend instead of the road . She had her head severely jerked forward and then back . A year after the accident she could not remember more than two states out of the union , though she studied a map of the u.s. often . She spoke slowly and haltingly . She was taking a few supplements and wanted to know if a more aggressive nutritional regimen could help-especially since it had already been a year since her accident . I said maybe , and at the worst it would do no harm except to her pocket book . ( These brain supplements are expensive . ) She was taking B complex , some vitamin c and an antioxidant formula . A nice start . But with brain damage of any kind , you need to get very aggressive with your nutrition . The sooner you can optimize nutrition for brain injuries , the better . The goal with such optimized nutrition is twofold : you want to help stop any further damage to the brain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help encourage the brain to heal . While some nerve cells are lost and may not be repairable , others may be encouraged to function better and pick up the slack . Making the brain cells you have work better can make an enormous difference . Optimizing nutrition for the brain also helps neurons set up new networks that can bypass damaged areas . // You also want to protect the brain from further damage that can be caused by an accident . One study showed that nearly a third of those with Alzheimer 's had had a head injury . Head injuries can set off a cascade of events that optimal nutrition can prevent . Wearing bike helmets and headgear during all sports is important for all of us as well . What was remarkable was that Kim responded to the regimen , even though she began it a full year after the accident , when one might think nutrition would no longer have a therapeutic effect-but it did . Here is what I put her on : After six months on this regimen , Kim was talking more clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she sounded better still as she talked to me over the phone and told me of plans she had to open her own business . She also told me that when she stopped the supplements for a month , she found that her brain function and memory were regressing . Helping Rosa with chronic fatigue A woman we 'll call Rosa is a good friend of mine . She had chronic fatigue since being in a car accident 10 years ago . She is an intelligent woman and would cry a lot because she could not perform well on her job or in life due to her fatigue . She had seen a host of alternative medicine practitioners and with little results . I was so busy when Rosa called that I could not fit her into my practice . I simply put her on 1000 mg of acetyl-L-carnitine and 300 mg of phosphatidyl serine and asked her to call me if she felt any better . That was on a Wednesday . On Saturday I got a message on my machine that for the first time in years she felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For her this was a huge breakthrough . From the striking results Rosa had , I believe that she was probably deficient in both acetyl-L-carnitine and phosphatidyl serine . This is not surprising , since there are virtually no food sources for these nutrients and since the body has a difficult time making them as we age . I saw Rosa recently at the health food store and she is still doing great : she just finished a huge project at work that she is very proud of . Helping Tom , who was robbed Violent crime in America touches many of us and brain injuries are often the result . A man we will call Tom was struck in the back of the head with a tire iron by a man who attempted to rob him . The result was that this once intelligent man could barely remember anything . He had great difficulty getting a job . Tom was put on 1500 mg of acetyl-Lcarnitine and 300 mg of phosphatidyl serine . His improvement was slow but after three months his memory was working better . He was able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and address-from memory . For Tom these were huge breakthroughs . He is far from his former self , unfortunately , but thanks to two powerful brain nutrients , he is able to support himself and is doing the best that can be hoped under the circumstances . The best thing about acetyl-L-carnitine is that it is completely natural . Because of this it is completely non-toxic . And acetyl-L-carnitine , like all natural compounds , works through many pathways to help keep the body well . When the body weakens , it does so at many points , not just at one particular area . That is why acetyl-L-carnitine and the natural medicine of which it is a part is so superior for disease prevention . No drug will ever work as well as acetyl-L-carnitine at slowing brain aging or promoting brain health , because no drug can match its breadth of influence on brain function . So do n't let anyone keep you from progressing because of their limited understanding of how the brain can heal . There are many stories like these and everyone I have ever dealt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nutrition to be a positive experience . No one has fully recovered because of nutrition but all have been helped . Brain cells always want to heal and have maximal function . Just give them an optimal supply of nutrients and they will show you just how much they want to heal . The Research on Acetyl-L-Carnitine Acetyl-L-carnitine maintains our ability to learn and interact positively with others as we age . In other words , it allows us to teach old dogs new tricks and make them happier throughout the process . It probably does this through its overall beneficial effects on brain function . Older adults given acetyl-L-carnitine saw their directional and word memory improve in a matter of weeks . Many studies have confirmed these beneficial effects on memory in older adults and the dose used in the studies is usually 2000 mg ( 2 g ) per day . Even alcoholics with cognitive impairment have benefited from acetyl-L-carnitine . Acetyl-L-Carnitine Benefits the Entire Body Acetyl-L-carnitine has been found to be an important nutrient for sperm health . It may also be important for the health of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sperm from free radical damage . Acetyl-L-carnitine has also been found useful in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy . There is mounting evidence that acetyl-L-carnitine plays a key role in immune defense . This is because immune cells require acetyl-L-carnitine to remain energetic when they defend the body and fight off pathogens . Acetyl-L-carnitine helps our immune cells stay healthy and strong . It has been found useful in the treatment of depression . This again is through its role in helping brain cells communicate more effectively . A social brain  --  one where nerve cells can communicate effectively-is a happy one . I have found the acetyl-L-carnitine , along with phosphatidyl serine , B complex and EPA/DHA , can virtually eliminate winter depression ( seasonal affective disorder ) , especially when combined with a healthy diet . Common Questions Asked About Acetyl-L-Carnitine Q : When should someone start taking acetyl-L-carnitine ? A : As early in adulthood as possible . College age is a good time . While I believe it is an essential supplement for everyone over 40 who wants optimal brain health and longevity , the damage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the college years . So for those who can afford it , I recommend taking acetyl-L-carnitine during stressful times ( studying , exam times ) , throughout one 's 20s and 30s , and regularly after age 40 . Brain aging starts young . If we are going to slow it down , we have to start optimizing nutrition and lifestyle as soon as possible . Only then can we get the best handle on preventing the loss of brain function later in life . Q. How much does acetyl-L-carnitine cost ? A : Acetyl-L-carnitine is somewhat expensive and I hope to see prices come down soon so that it will become more affordable . This may be the main limiting factor for many who want to take it . When you compare the cost of a dose of acetyl-L-carnitine ( 500 mg ) to the price of a cup of coffee , however , you realize that it costs less , energizes the brain in a much more beneficial way and has none of the downside of coffee . A lifetime of taking acetyl-L-carnitine will leave you with a much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Q Is there anyone who should not take acetyl-L-carnitine ? A : I do not recommend that acetyl-Lcarnitine be taken without supervision in someone with epilepsy or someone who is a manic depressive ( bipolar ) . Such people do not always need more energy in their brain cells . However , epileptics taking medications such as Valproate-which induces carnitine deficiency-should take supplemental acetyl or regular L-carnitine at a dose of 500 mg per day . Q. Are there any side effects to taking acetyl-L-carnitine ? A : One of the side effects of taking acetyl-L-carnitine regularly is more vivid dreams at night . Some enjoy this while others do not . Adjust your dose of acetyl-L-carnitine to correspond with how much you like to dream . Q : What about older folks who have the beginnings of dementia-how much should they take ? A : They should take 500 mg to 2500 mg of acetyl-L-carnitine per day . Ideally they should also be given vitamin B12 shots and plenty of B vitamins orally-these are all often deficient in those over 60 . Phosphatidyl choline , 2000 mg per day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the guidance of one 's healthcare practitioner . Q : Are there nutrients that help acetyl-L-carnitine work more effectively ? A : Yes , B vitamins , magnesium , phosphatidyl choline and EPA/DHA ( fish oils ) all increase the effectiveness of acetyl-L-carnitine . For references send a SASE to totalhealth magazine .
