Headnote Nine out 10 gastric-bypass patients with the disease report dramatic drops in blood sugar levels , but some doctors warn about taking such a drastic step // Populartalk show host Mother Love was 257 pounds , a diabetic and she knew she 'd be dead soon if something did n't change . Since diabetes killed both parents , and she was at high risk because she was obese , she opted for a drastic step-gastric bypass surgery . She was ready for the massive weight loss-she dropped 111 pounds-but what she and others did n't know was that the surgery would , in effect , " cure " her of the deadly blood sugar disease . Across the country , the gastric bypass procedure is starting to deliver the unexpected benefit of " curing " type 2 diabetes in many obese patients , according to experts in the field . Now , some in the medical community are calling for its more widespread use in an effort to stave off the rapid growth of the deadly disease , particularly in the African-American community . But other doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose weight through more natural methods to better manage their diabetes . In the most comprehensive review of gastric-bypass surgery to date , published in 2004 in the Journal of the American Medical Association , 70 percent of the more than 22,000 obese or morbidly obese patients with diabetes found that there was resolution of their diabetes after gastric-bypass surgery . Other studies , which assessed type 2 diabetes before and after weight-loss surgery , show as high as a 90 percent " cure " rate for diabetes . Now doctors like Titus Duncan , an Atlanta surgeon who serves on the executive council of the American Association for Bariatric Surgeons , are trying to spread the word that gastric-bypass surgery is indeed a viable option for those with diabetes . " With the right surgeon , this procedure is a lifesaver , " he says . " It pretty much cures diabetes . " Because type 2 diabetes is a disease of the foregut-the first part of the stomach and digestive system-the operation has proven effective in directing food and sugars away from the insulin-sensitive part of the body 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duncan , " the diabetes goes away . " " We used to think that the diabetes resolved because the patient was losing weight . But what we have found out is that the diabetes would completely go away within a couple weeks after surgery , and that is usually before the patient has lost a significant amount of weight . This happened by the food stream avoiding the foregut , because that 's where the receptors are that stimulate the problem that we have with diabetes . " Duncan says that the results have been so positive that there is a push to make the bypass procedure , now only available to the obese , available to anyone with type 2 diabetes , whether obese or not . " We are trying to get that changed because we think that if we can cure type 2 diabetes , it should be offered to everyone , " says Duncan , who says that he has " cured " more than 800 people with type 2 diabetes . " It 's a no-brainer to me . Dying by losing your extremities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow painful death is a terrible way to go , as far as I am concerned . Especially in the African-American community , which is hit so hard by diabetes . " But health care experts like Dr. Duane T. Smoot , chairman of the Department of Medicine at Howard University Hospital , warns that much thought should be given before someone who is obese , much less someone who is not , undergoes such a drastic surgical procedure . " It is an option ... but the problem is that there are just certain centers that do a good job , and other centers that do n't ... So it 's important to be picky , " says Smoot , adding that Howard 's hospital does not offer the gastric-bypass procedure . " This is something that was done many years ago and the outcomes were very poor ... There have been a lot of mistakes , and this has become one of the most frequent causes of lawsuits in the country . " Smoot says that one problem with weight-loss surgery is that the procedure uses a mechanical solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run into problems when you do that , " he says . " When you 're talking about weight and calories , it 's going to be more the art of medicine than the science of medicine that will be most effective . It 's better to try to get into a program where you lose weight naturally , using a team approach , to deal with the physical and mental aspects of weight . " The American Diabetes Association has remained neutral on the benefits of gastric-bypass surgery in resolving diabetes . In a position statement , the association noted : " Bariatric surgery may be considered for some morbidly obese individuals with type 2 diabetes ... and can result in marked improvements in glycemia ( blood sugar levels ) . The long-term benefits and risks of bariatric surgery in individuals with pre-diabetes or diabetes continue to be studied . " In the United States , two out of every three adults-or 127 million people-are overweight , and almost half of them are obese . But more worrisome , 8 million Americans are morbidly obese , being 100 pounds or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mass Index ( BMI ) of 40 or more . Studies show that diet and medication have low success rates in treating obesity , which is the second leading cause of preventable death in the U.S. Most people who lose 100 or more pounds through diet and exercise tend to gain some , if not all the weight back within one year , according to the National Institutes of Health . Conversely , about 140,000 patients a year undergo weight-loss surgery , and lose on average 77 percent of their excess weight within a year of surgery . The procedure typically costs between $20,000 and $25,000 , and is usually covered by insurance . While it 's still a risky procedure-many patients die each year on the table or following the procedure-the demand for the surgery is far outpacing supply of skilled doctors , resulting in many bariatric surgeons having two-year waiting lists . Mother Love is one who can testify to the benefits of gastric-bypass surgery as it relates to diabetes . Before having the procedure , the motivational speaker and comedian was morbidly obese and was taking pills daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both parents-to diabetes , she says that she saw the writing on the wall , and decided to take action . " It was either take a proactive approach and get better , or die early , " says Love , who has written a book , Half the Mother Twice the Love , about her experiences . " This is what I opted to do . This is what worked for me . It was a drastic , last-ditch effort for me . But my life was at stake . " Since having gastric-bypass surgery three years ago , she has lost 111 pounds and no longer needs diabetes medication . " I took the last pill for diabetes the day before I had my procedure , " she says . " Before the surgery , my blood sugar numbers were all over the place . " In her mind , she knows that she made the right choice for her , even though her family disagreed with her decision . " My sister slammed the phone down on me , " she says . " She told me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal with it . ' ' " Some of her business associates had the same attitude . " My agent dropped me , my management team dropped me , everybody in Hollywood turned their back on me , " she says . " They said , " If you lose weight , what are you going to do ? You 're Mother Love . You 're going to take people out of their comfort zone . How am I going to market you ? You 're supposed to be happy-go-lucky . ' ' " " My hope is that people do n't get to the point where they have to have gastric-bypass surgery , " she says . " But if they do , they need to know that it 's not a quick fix . It 's a tool . It 's a lifestyle change . I have to exercise . I have to eat right . I 'm a living example that you do n't have to live with this disease .
