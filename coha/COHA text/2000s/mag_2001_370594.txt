Chris Rock 's voice is a marvel in and of itself , an unlikely fusion of gravel and pipsqueakitude . Always shouting but miraculously never hoarse , he 's the bastard vocal son of Redd Foxx and Rosie Perez . And when it comes to American Bestness , Rock may be this project 's least controversial selection . After all , TIME has already labeled the 35-year-old comedian " the funniest man in America " in a previous issue . His professed admirers include peers such as Woody Allen ( " I 'd love to work with him " ) , Richard Pryor ( " Does he remind me of me ? I 'm afraid so " ) and Jerry Seinfeld ( " It 's the yelling that makes his style special " ) . <P> Then again , Rock may be one of this project 's more controversial selections . Just last month , The New Republic devoted 4,000 words to explain why he and fellow African-American comic Chris Tucker were " reactionary " and to decry Rock 's " reliance upon minstrelsy and coon comedy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politically incorrect humor gives cover to racists  --  most infamously his " Niggas vs . Black People " routine from the Bring the Pain HBO special that helped revive his career in 1996 after three years in the wilderness that followed his underutilized tenure on Saturday Night Live . As the heart of the bit went : " Every time black people want to have a good time , ign'ant-ass niggas f  --  - it up ! ... Ca n't do nothing ! Ca n't keep a disco open more than three weeks ! Grand opening ! Grand closing ! Ca n't go to a movie the first week it comes out ! Why ? Cause niggas are shooting at the screen ! ... I love black people , but I hate niggas , brother . Oh , I hate niggas ! " <P> As a lifelong white person , I would normally be reluctant to parse anyone 's use , aside from David Duke 's , of what my people now refer to as " the N word . " But since I 'm being paid to grapple with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point about how street culture celebrates boorish behavior , and how that can feed racist stereotypes , and how dispiriting that is . As with all great comedians  --  which is to say , as with all original thinkers  --  Rock 's insights are beyond tidy labels such as " black , " " white , " " left , " " right , " " offensive " or " as harmlessly amusing as Friends . " Unlike many of today 's allegedly political comics , whose insights go no deeper than poking knee-jerk fun at Bill Clinton 's appetites or George W. Bush 's intellectual dullness , Rock at his best lays bare society 's underlying fault lines . And there 's no one he wo n't take to task : last season his HBO talk show featured a parody instructional video , How Not to Get Your Ass Kicked by the Police . " Follow these easy tips , " Rock said . " First , obey the law ! " Rock knows the most cathartic laughter springs from a masochistic impulse . ( Sadistic laughter , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Bring the pain  --  please .
