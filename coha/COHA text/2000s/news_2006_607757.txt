<p> As the crowd in the Superdome roared its loudest and the New Orleans Saints drove steadily down the field , the Washington Redskins on the sideline screamed " Shut the box ! " to their defensive teammates . This was n't some obscure NFL code . The box in question was simply the cardboard container on the New Orleans sideline in which the Saints had stored their NFC South Division championship hats . After a season in which the Redskins have disappointed their own fans so often , Washington players wanted to spoil someone else 's celebration . <p> And why would n't so perverse a Washington season take such a twist ? " Tape that box shut , " yelled the Redskins , clinging to a 16-10 lead as Drew Brees led the highest-rated offense in the NFC to the 16-yard line with a minute to play . Finally , on fourth-and-seven , Carlos Rogers spun in the end zone and , at the last instant , deflected a pass away from Terrance Copper . <p> As the ball dropped and no penalty flags appeared , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dance . Guard Randy Thomas bear hugged defensive back Troy Vincent and tight end Chris Cooley exchanged high fives with defensive end Andre Carter . Offense and defense bonded as the team improved to 5-9 . To look at them , you 'd have thought the Redskins had won a crucial game . <p> " After everything that has happened to us this season , I 've never been prouder of a bunch of guys , " said Coach Joe Gibbs , who presumably was fairly proud of his three Super Bowl champions . " It would have been very easy for them to say , ' Hey , I 'm checkin ' it in . ' But they played as hard as they can play . " <p> Then , because he just ca n't control his decency , Gibbs added , " If we ca n't get in there to the playoffs , we wish the Saints the best . " Who does n't ? As luck would have it , other NFC teams lost and the Saints did get to the playoffs , winning the division title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Redskins , who have everything , think they have " overcome adversity " because they finally played one polished game  --  with no turnovers , no dropped passes , only three penalties and just one gain by the Saints for more than 20 yards . Ladell Betts rushed for 119 yards , caught passes for 43 more yards and outperformed Deuce McAllister and Reggie Bush combined ( 162 to 101 total yards on offense ) . Where has this been for 14 weeks ? Now they show up ? <p> Meantime , it is the Saints who have come to symbolize hope in defiance of long odds to football fans across the country . Last year , they were 3-13 . Now they 're one victory from bringing a home playoff game to New Orleans . No city has ever wanted a long postseason run more desperately . Each playoff game would bring dollars to an economically devastated city that counts every French Quarter tour and po ' boy it sells . <p> " Nothing bounced our way today . The Redskins came out ready to play . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brees , held to a 59.9 passer rating by the Redskins ' best defensive effort of the season . " We still had a chance to win in the end . But we did n't . <p> " Still , look where we are now after everybody picked us to finish last before the season . It 's a pretty big accomplishment . " <p> And yet it was not one gained at the direct expense of the Redskins . The Saints can wear their NFC South title hats  --  Monday . <p> " They were ranked number one in offense . People were saying we were near the bottom of the barrel on defense , " defensive tackle Cornelius Griffin said . " But we 've stuck together . We played for pride , for each other and for the uniform . " <p> And , like almost every one of the Redskins , Griffin gets excited every time he realizes that , in the last month , Gibbs has taken the team back to his old intimidating running style . " I love to watch Ladell run downhill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When we get Clinton Portis back , we 're going to wear some people out next year . " <p> That hope certainly keeps the Redskins focused . Betts had 22 carries , the same as McAllister and Bush combined , yet he outgained them 119-62 . For the fourth straight week , the Redskins stuck to their new/old mantra : Run the ball , stop the run . " We drew a line in the sand . This is what we want to be . This is Redskin football , " Gibbs said . " In general , we 've stuck to it . " With better execution or a few takeaways , all four games might have been won . Regardless of their record , however , the men in the trenches are playing with violent relish once more . <p> " On the sideline , our offensive linemen are saying , ' Let us have it . We want to run it , ' " Gibbs said , chuckling . Also , the more the Redskins run , the easier pass protection becomes and the less pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays . Early in the season , the team had to adapt to the offensive system of new coach Al Saunders . Now the game plan is a two-way street , attempting to marry Saunders 's 700-page playbook with the existing talents and temperament of Redskins who are more inclined to put 700 welts on somebody 's forehead . <p> " We kind of got away from it , " Thomas said . " This is what we do . " Then Thomas let out a menacing but comical grunt , akin to Tony Soprano saying , " This is what we do " after somebody is found encased in cement . <p> The largest mystery of the season has been the almost complete lack of takeaways and sacks by a Gregg Williams defense that can only justify its high-risk existence by making game-changing plays . Even in this stellar effort , the rewards were minimal . Brees was sacked twice and intercepted once  --  by Rogers . <p> " I teased Carlos about the fact that he wants three interceptions for that one , because it took him three times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Williams said of the critical fourth-quarter interception that was the first in Rogers ' hands-of-stone season . But that applies for much of the defense . <p> " If we would have caught half of the balls we 've dropped , this would have been a different season , " Williams said . Then , holding his fingers half-an-inch apart , he said , " It 's been that kind of year . " <p> Is that absolutely classic excuse-making ? Or are the Redskins closer to a Gibbs-style rebuilding than many think ? No question is more crucial because the answer informs every offseason decision on personnel . Yet it 's a devilishly tricky issue . <p> Late-season games by out-of-the-hunt teams are notoriously poor measures of future ability . Many teams , especially the highly-paid , underachieving kind , like the ' 06 Redskins , get ornery and productive as soon as their season has been torched . One of the worst reproaches in sports is to say a gifted team only plays its best once it is reduced to being a spoiler . <p> The Redskins have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they have to believe they are far closer to success than any normal NFL measure would suggest . After all , what 's their alternative ? Gibbs has almost finished three years of his five-year contract . If the team he has built is fundamentally flawed in either talent or competitive personality , then the Redskins have to blow up their roster this offseason  --  again . <p> That 's not going to happen . The Redskins ' hope is that the team on display against the Saints  --  the one that emerged after Gibbs drew his line in the sand  --  will be the outfit that shows up for the last two games . And next season , too , albeit with a more polished Campbell at quarterback . Truth or delusion ? Wait and see . It 's the only option .
