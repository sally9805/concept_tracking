There 's a nasty new trend out there that could turn you into an unwitting soft-core porn star . Find out why a silly vacation stunt could haunt you for the rest of your life . // Three years ago , Linda Field* , now 32 , decided to take a break from her job at a central Texas law firm and head down to Mardi Gras in New Orleans with her younger sister Shari . Along with thousands of other people crowded onto Bourbon Street for the annual preLent celebration , Linda and Shari enjoyed the frenzied carnival atmosphere , watching parades , listening to jazz bands , and laughing at the throngs of women who , in Mardi Gras tradition , flashed their breasts to male revelers in exchange for plastic bead necklaces . A few evenings into their five-day vacation , Linda paused on the sidewalk and impulsively lifted her tee shirt to the crowd too . " It was totally out of character , " she admits . " But I was hundreds of miles away from home and caught up in the fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to see these people again ? " Flash-forward two years . A former colleague and friend stopped by to see Linda , now a successful attorney at a different law firm , and informed her that he 'd seen her-topless-on a video called Girls Gone Wild Mardi Gras , which he 'd just watched at his cousin 's house . " At first , I did n't believe him . I thought it was a case of mistaken identity , " says Linda . " Then he described the exact scene from Mardi Gras when I 'd flashed the crowd two years ago . A video camera had captured all of it . " Humiliated , Linda told her boyfriend , John , who encouraged her to forget about it . " We figured that maybe only this one guy had seen the tape , " says Linda . But when John was approached by a coworker six months later who said , " Hey , I saw your girlfriend on a tape ! " and even the butcher at Linda 's supermarket was making comments about it , Linda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torment her for years . THE RISE OF REALITY PORN Welcome to the new world of reality porn , where women bathing topless on the beach , vying for beads at Mardi Gras , or doing any number of potentially silly but risque activities can be unwittingly turned into soft-core porn stars . It all started five years ago , when Joe Francis , a then-24-year-old producer of the independent video series Banned From Television , put a call out for footage of women flashing their breasts and letting loose at parties . Since that first hourlong compilation called Girls Gone Wild debuted in 1998 , Francis has released a whopping 51 more titles to overwhelming success . Although Francis 's company , MRA Holding , does n't release sales figures , it 's estimated that 2 million Girls Gone Wild tapes are sold each year . According to VideoScan , a company that tracks sales from major retailers , GGW titles have made it into the Top 10 Adult Video and DVD lists in the past two years . ( Francis now owns a private jet and is building a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ megabucks , these tapes have also launched a new trend in entertainment for men-from other video series like Wild Party Girls to Web sites boasting " real-girl content . " While subscriptions to old-school magazines like Hustler and Penthouse have dropped , reality porn is thriving . " Most men are getting tired of cookie-cutter porn starlets , simulated sex acts , and gaudy productions , " explains one of the owners of Realgirlstv.com , a members-only Web site that promises , among other things , " 65,500+ photos of drunk party sluts ! " " Guys love the idea of catching the girl next door doing something she would not normally do . " But what about how the girl next door feels ? " For a girl to be on Girls Gone Wild is a status symbol-it 's your 15 minutes of fame , " Francis has claimed . But several women strongly disagree , arguing that they did n't know they were being filmed , never gave their permission , and were never paid for the footage by companies like M RA . In one case , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was persuaded to enter a wet-tee-shirt contest and was then videotaped . " This is not fun and games , " says David Sergi , a lawyer based in Texas who is representing one of the women . " Do you really want topless pictures of yourself out there in public 10 years from now , once you 've become a successful actress or lawyer ? " CONNIVING CAMERAMEN Unlike regular porn , reality porn has often been shot not-by professional photographers but by amateurs who stake out bars and beaches in vacation spots , a practice that makes the genre seem deceptively noncommercial . Even regular  --  seeming guys who just happen to have a handheld video camera have gained worldwide distribution for their footage . Three years ago , Nikki Jones* , now 20 , was at a gas station in Panama City Beach , Florida , when two college-age guys with video cameras approached her Nissan Maxima . It was Labor Day weekend , and Nikki , a student in central Florida , and three of her friends had spent their day cruising the strip and hanging out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their breasts for what sounded like harmless vacation footage , even promising them some plastic beads like the ones given away at Mardi Gras . One of Nikki 's friends , 21-year-old Heidi* , gladly lifted her top . Nikki refused , but the guys did n't go away . " C'm on . It 's just for us . No one else will see it , " they pleaded-so convincingly that for a split second , Nikki pulled up her tube top . She had completely forgotten about the event until more than a year later , when a friend from Texas called and said he 'd seen Nikki on a Girls Gone Wild commercial shown during the Howard Stern show . " I was like No way ! I never did that ! ' It took me two minutes even to place where I could have been filmed , " says Nikki . " At first , I was just shocked , then I got really mad . Those guys made a point of saying they would be the only ones to see the footage . If I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national ad , I never , ever would have done it . " As if it 's not bad enough to find out your image is immortalized on tape , several women have been even more disturbed by the fact that they 're also being used to sell more of these products . In March 2000 , Becky Lynn Gritzke , then a Florida State University business student , traveled to Mardi Gras with her boyfriend and two other friends , became swept up in the mayhem , and like Linda , briefly lifted her shirt . A month later , Becky 's business classmates mentioned they 'd seen her in an ad for Girls Gone Wild . Becky 's humiliation did n't end there : Soon after , she learned her topless photo was also on the Girls Gone Wild Web site , on the cover of a video , and even plastered on a billboard in Italy . ( MRA has denied advertising in Europe . ) BEING BAMBOOZLED Some women even allege that alcohol was used to lower their inhibitions and get them to do kinky things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove down to South Padre Island with some pals from Southwest Texas State University to celebrate spring break . One night , they crossed the border into Mexico and wound up at a popular bar that was having a wet  --  tee-shirt contest . Amber says she was targeted by bar employees and given several drinks until she was wasted , and the next thing she knew , she was in front of a crowd of strangers with her top off . Nearly 10 months later , Amber 's friends began mentioning they 'd seen her on TV Then strangers on the street began whistling at her and yelling for her to take off her top . As it turned out , footage from that wet-tee-shirt contest in Mexico had been taped for Wild Party Girls , a video series and Web site owned by Floridabased AccroMedia . A shot of Amber was even being used to promote the Wild Party Girls video on cable , a red strip proclaiming " Too Hot for TV ! " stamped across her bare breasts . As a result of all the embarrassment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop out of school temporarily . " Some girls may want to be on these videos , but they need to be given a choice when they 're sober and able to sign a consent form , " says Sergi , whom Amber has hired to help her fight back . " If you bought a girl a bunch of drinks , then took advantage of her because she was exceedingly drunk , you 'd find yourself in jail for rape . In our opinion , the bar employees and agents of AccroMedia assisted my client in becoming intoxicated and got her to do things she would not otherwise do . " THE LEGAL LOOPHOLES Everyone has the right to privacy in one 's own home . But unfortunately , there is no specific law that says you ca n't be taped in a public place , so the argument that a victim 's privacy has been violated is n't particularly strong . However , some states have statutes against the unfair commercial use of such images . " A person 's going topless does n't inherently indicate agreement to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the editor of Privacy Journal . As a precaution against any claims of unfair commercial use , most mainstream filmmakers and magazines get signed release forms from anyone who is portrayed in their products . But women like Amber say they never signed any consent forms , and in the past year alone , at least four lawsuits-one against AccroMedia and three against MRA Holding-have been filed , and a class action lawsuit may also be in the works . Amber filed a whopping $5 million lawsuit against AccroMedia , claiming invasion of privacy and emotional distress . ( The case is still pending . ) Linda is suing for personal injury , while under a Florida state law , Becky and Nikki are suing for having their likenesses used for a commercial purpose without consent . ( To complicate things , Nikki was also a minor when she was filmed and not even legally able to give consent . ) Ronald Guttman , a defense lawyer for M RA Holding , contends that these lawsuits are unfounded . " The majority of women enjoy the experience and indicate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you look at the films , you can see that , " he says . Domenic Massari , legal counsel for AccroMedia , agrees . Posing for the camera in various stages of undress " is a rite of passage , " he says . " It may be the last time these girls get to do something silly before they enter adulthood and are unable to party in the same way . " Nonetheless , both companies seem to be changing their ways since being sacked with lawsuits . Guttman says that official GGW areas are now set up beachside or at participating nightclubs , with crew members clearly identifiable in Girls Gone Wild baseball caps and tee shirts . Participants are asked for IDs and are required to sign release forms . Although visitors to GGW 's Web site are still given the opportunity to send in nude or seminude photos of girls , a consent form must accompany each submission ( although such a form could easily be forged by someone else , like a disgruntled ex-boyfriend , for example ) . Meanwhile , Massari says that Wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crews , and all girls are asked if they want to participate before they 're filmed . " There are big signs up saying videotaping is going on . We 're not using briefcase cameras , " says Massari . " But we 're not the ones who put on the wet  --  tee-shirt contests in the first place . The club does , and we just tape them . " PROTECTION FROM REALITY PORN But do n't drop your guard just yet-it remains to be seen whether such reassurances will make a difference , and you 're still at risk of being shot by one of the many Web cams set up in bars in vacation spots around the country . The best defense is to go into party situations with your eyes open and be on the lookout for cameras . Also , realize the risk you take by baring yourself in public . Although you may feel anonymous in a huge crowd , someone with the latest digital lens may not agree . If your topless dare in Key West does surface on the Internet , contact the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If that does n't work , consider taking legal action , although the battle may be messy and wo n't ever fully restore your privacy . " You can get an injunction to stop the spread of videos or have pictures removed from Web sites , " says Harold J. Krent , the interim dean at Chicago-Kent College of Law and a privacy expert . " But it 's hard to control the damage to a reputation . " Footnote * 1ames have been changed . // <p>
