Until Mussolini drained the mosquito-infested marshes south of Rome in the 1930s , malaria struck the city with such deadly regularity each summer that it was called the Roman fever . Last week two British scientists said they have found what may be the first genetic evidence that the killer disease was a blight on life in ancient Rome as well . <P> The evidence comes from the leg bone of a three-year-old child buried in a cemetery 70 miles north of Rome in the empire 's waning days , circa A.D. 450 . The remains were among some four dozen small skeletons  --  mostly of infants or stillbirths  --  excavated there in the early 1990s by University of Arizona archaeologist David Soren and colleagues . Because so many of the babies were preemies , and all seem to have been interred at about the same time , Soren suspected a malaria epidemic . <P> Using bone samples from five children , Robert Sallares , a research fellow at the University of Manchester in England , succeeded in obtaining snatches of malarial DNA from just one skeleton . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most virulent form of malaria . <P> Though the technique may help unravel ancient medical riddles , Sallares is n't claiming it has explained why Rome fell . While malaria is debilitating and people would have done less work , he says , " they would have moved to the hilltops because mosquitoes do n't like to climb mountains . "
