A few weeks ago , an American Express security official placed an urgent call to New York City-based Secret Service agent Tim Raymond . Someone in Miami had racked up at least a half-million dollars worth of fraudulent charges against more than 100 American Express accounts . The cards had n't been stolen , so they had to be counterfeits  --  very good ones , since they had zipped past the security screens in the computers of the giant charge-card company . <P> The bad guys in Florida covered their tracks expertly , but the American Express computers spat out a curious fact . Every one of the victimized cardholders had recently dined at one of two New York City restaurants . Raymond and his partners visited one of them , a Brazilian steak house on Central Park South called Plantation , and with the cooperation of the restaurant 's mortified owner , they looked around the employee dressing room . There , in an open locker , they spotted the likely culprit : a black box the size of a Palm Pilot , with a slit down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Called a " skimmer , " the device can read and store the data embedded within a charge card 's magnetic stripe  --  not only the name , number and expiration date that appear on the card 's face but also an invisible , encrypted verification code that is transmitted electronically from merchant to card issuer to confirm a card 's validity at the point of sale . By copying that code , the counterfeiter has all the data needed to create a perfect clone of the charge card . <P> " Skimming is the biggest problem in bank fraud today , " says Gregory Regan , head of the Secret Service financial-crimes division . " It 's the bank robbery of the future . It 's technically simple , point-and-click technology . And the equipment is cheap . If you skim 15 or 20 accounts , you can generate $50,000 to $60,000 worth of fraud , and nobody is going to know about it till the victims get their bills , 30 to 60 days after the crime . So the odds of getting caught are reduced . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are losing to skimmers  --  in part because they do n't want to scare customers out of using their plastic . But an analysis of industry-published figures suggests that skimmers reaped about $125 million last year , and Secret Service agents suspect that the number is actually higher , with much of that plunder going to international crime rings . " It 's not unusual , " says Regan , " to see a card compromised in New York City or Washington and the numbers used overseas , in Taiwan , Japan or Europe , within 24 to 48 hours .
