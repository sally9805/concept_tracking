It 's not easy stepping into another mother 's shoes-but lots of love and patience can go a long way toward winning a little boy 's heart // A few days after we met , Zachary proposed . This was a problem . Zachary was 5 . I was the 37-year-old girlfriend of his widowed father . After I gently declined , Zach 's proposal took various permutations . Most of his ideas involved my waiting for him to grow up . Once , he suggested that I marry his dad , and then divorce him when he , Zachary , got big enough to marry me himself . Over time , Zach and I grew more attached to each other . He thrived at having a female ( and often simply a practical ) presence in his life-someone , as he put it , who knew that vegetables did not have to come out of freezers . In the meantime , his dad and I had been blessed with a certainty about our shared future . We met in September , were ring shopping by April , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Zach was upset when we told him about our plans . His mother had been diagnosed with colon cancer when he was 3 months old , and she died a month after his first birthday . He clung fiercely to the images he held of her , images drawn not from memory but from videos , stories , and bedside photos . When Ken and I mentioned marriage , his response was a heart-wrenching torrent of tears . Zach understood that nothing would bring his mother back , yet he hoped-and hope is painful to surrender . seeing the grief etched on his face , we decided to put a halt to our plans and give him time . He did n't need much , only a few weeks . One evening , as I was toweling him off after a bath , he extended his arm and tapped my shoulder with his toothbrush , " dubbing " me a member of his family . " You are now a Cohen , " he intoned , mimicking a king . As I tucked him into bed that night , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the family are you going to be ? " he said . " You 're too big to be the sister . I guess you 'll have to be the mommy . " Ken and I got formally engaged soon after , and we asked Zach not to tell anyone until we could tell our families . Fat chance . The next morning , Zach burst into his classroom shouting , " I 'm getting a mommy ! " He came home that afternoon glowing , with a book of crayoned drawings by his classmates all about his new mom . Zach found his own ways to deal with his conflicting feelings about his biological mom and me . We taught him from the start that he would always have two mommies , Mommy Gillian and me . I would live in his house , but Mommy Gillian would live in his heart . One day , while we were walking across the parking lot at the mall , he described the castle he was building in his heart for her , complete with chandeliers and Oriental carpet . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could visit me and we could become friends . I 'm not sure how I managed to drive us home safely through my tears . The wedding took place on a glorious summer day , amid shady trees and beds of bright flowers . With the gray tails of his morning suit flapping , Zach , five weeks shy of his sixth birthday , ran around excitedly telling everyone that he was the " ring barrow " and that he could keep the little satin pillow . When our guests commented on what a happy event the wedding was , he took proud ownership . " It was the best idea I ever had , " he 'd reply modestly , apparently believing that we would never have thought of marriage without him . Zach had wanted to call me Mommy as soon as Ken and I got engaged , but we 'd discouraged him . At bedtime , though , we let him say good night to " my mommy-to-be . " He clutched my hand as he said that and looked so happy . Right after the ceremony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " Mommy ? " he said softly , half querying , half rejoicing . I bent my head down to his . " Yes , Zach , I 'm Mommy . " At the reception , he watched Ken 's brother and mine give toasts , and then without any warning , he strode out onto the reception floor and lifted his own glass of bubbly cider . " To my new family , " he said . Zach integrated himself easily into my family , and I 'm forever grateful to all of them for embracing him as I had-not as my adoptive son , or my stepson , or my husband 's son , but as my son . There were moments of anxiety as Zach 's new grandparents , aunts , and uncles tried to get used to this energetic 5-year-old , but everyone was patient and , from the start , treated Zach just like any other kid in the family-hugged when he needed a hug , scolded when he needed a scolding . I had a new family , too-not just in-laws but ex-in-laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they welcomed me , if a bit tentatively . I knew it must be wrenching for them to see me take what to them was still Gillian 's place in Zach 's life , and it must have been jarring for them to hear me be called Zach 's mother . But we 're on good terms . Any doubts or antagonisms vanished years ago as we realized that we had one great bond in common , our love for Zach . Gillian also had two children from her first marriage . They were in their late teens and lived with their father in Michigan . I met them when they came east to visit Zach and the rest of the family , and Ken , Zach , and I flew out to see them a few months before the wedding . I never tried to be their mother-unlike Zach , they had their memories . I did n't try to be their stepmother either . But over the years , we became friends , then good friends , then family , and I 'm really happy to have them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed about how unfair it is that I get his entire adolescence but only half his childhood . I missed out on so many precious firsts-his first step , his first word . I did n't see his delight when he first saw a rainbow , an ocean , a monkey . I do n't know if he was afraid of thunder . Just as Zach has to try to wring knowledge of his mother from videos and scrapbooks , I have to turn to them to experience secondhand my own son 's early childhood . Shortly after our wedding , Ken and I drew up wills and Ken appointed me Zach 's legal guardian , giving me the right to make educational and health decisions and custody of Zach should anything happen to him . But we postponed a legal adoption for several reasons . We did n't want Gillian 's family to feel that I was " erasing " her . And we wanted to have a child together , so we thought it would be wise to hold adoption in reserve . If Zach felt less loved than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ritual around adoption to enforce our bond . As it turned out , four years later we did have a baby , but Zach , then 10 , did n't seem to experience a sense of being second-class . If anything , Ilan 's birth had tremendous healing power . It normalized Zach 's life somehow , made him more whole , patched up at least a few of those gaps in his psyche that I could never fill , no matter how much love I poured in . He stayed in the hospital with me overnight when Ilan was born . " It 's male bonding , " he told me . " You would n't get it . " And he 's a wonderful big brother ; Ilan said " Gak " at 10 months , even before he said " Mania . " Ken and I completed a legal adoption shortly after that , partly for Zach 's sake , but as much for my own . I wanted Zach to be as much mine legally as he was emotionally . I wanted him to be every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my belly . The adoption process , which required a ridiculous amount of paperwork despite the fact that I 'd already raised Zach for much of his life , turned out to be a bittersweet affair , more difficult for Zach and Ken than we 'd anticipated . It was a celebration of their bond with me , of our choice to be a family . Yet it triggered another avalanche of grief , particularly when we learned that Maryland law did n't treat this type of adoption any differently from that of a teen mom surrendering a baby at birth , and that Zach would be issued a new birth certificate , with my name replacing Gillian 's . We quickly ordered extra copies of the original certificate for him to keep . But we left the courthouse squabbling , and it took us a good hour before we understood why we were feeling so much heartache , and once again found a way to balance the sorrow of the past with the joy of our future . For the first two or three years after Ken and I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " our anniversary , " and I realized that in a way he was right . I had married both father and son , just as he 'd proposed back in kindergarten . Families are package deals . Friends , including other mothers , often comment on how lucky Zach was to get me . I always tell them that I was the lucky one-and that he has a heart large enough to wrap itself around both me and the woman who bore him . I 'm his mother , not his stepmother , not only because I want to be but because he 's allowed me to be , and our bond has a special intensity because we know we chose each other . After the wedding , Zach was a little bothered that I had n't changed my last name , that unlike him , I was n't a " Cohen . " But he quickly worked that out for himself .
