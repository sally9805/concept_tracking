When Early February - 11 p.m . Late February - 10 p.m . Early March - 9 p.m . Late March - Dusk In other months Early November - 5 a.m . Early December - 3 a.m . Early January - 1 a.m . How Go out within an hour or so of the time listed at left . Turn the map around so the edge marked with the direction you 're facing is down . The stars above this horizon on the map now match the stars in front of you . The map 's center is overhead . So a star plotted halfway from the edge to the center can be found in the sky about halfway from horizontal to straight up . For example : Turn the map so its northeast ( NE ) horizon is down . About halfway from there to the center is the Big Dipper , standing on its handle . Go out and look northeast about halfway from horizontal to straight up . There 's the Big Dipper ! ( Planets are positioned for mid-March . ) AS ED TING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IS WHEN // The map is plotted for 40 deg north latitude ( for example , Denver , New York , Madrid ) . If you 're far south of there , stars in the southern part of the sky will be higher and stars in the north lower . Far north of 40 deg the reverse is true . // scores of skygazers haul out their telescopes and attempt to observe all 110 objects in Charles Messier 's catalog of deep-sky treasures in a single night . But what about a Binocular Marathon ? Ting 's list of the Messier objects ( page 119 ) gives a rough indication of the challenge involved in finding each object on Marathon night . All objects listed as " easy " should be evident in 7X50 or IOX50 binoculars , while the majority of those in the 11 moderate " category should also be detectable . Much will depend on sky conditions and the skill and endurance of the individual , but I suspect that some observers will be able to track down as many as 50 or 60 objects . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Messier objects that can be swept up in a matter of minutes . Give it a try , and be sure to let us know how you make out . // <p>
