<p> By most every basketball measure , Lutheran Christian Academy in Philadelphia is among the most successful high school programs in the nation . More than a dozen of its athletes are currently playing at Division I colleges , including Georgetown and George Washington . And it has a 92-11 record over the past three seasons . <p> But among some college coaches , the private school has become a symbol of what they believe is one of the game 's growing problems : prep schools with questionable academic programs that help players with deficient academic performances become eligible to play Division I sports . <p> The school does not have its own building or formal classrooms , and it operates out of a community center in a ragged North Philadelphia neighborhood . It has just one full-time employee : the basketball coach , a former sanitation worker who founded the school . One former student , who attended the school for three months , said it did not use traditional textbooks and that the coach , Darryl Schofield , was the only teacher . <p> Yet Lutheran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Prep schools are the biggest problem in our sport today , and Lutheran Christian Academy is one of the worst , " said one college head coach , who has visited the school . Said an assistant coach , who recruits from schools in the Philadelphia area : " We do n't recruit players from Lutheran . Lutheran 's players are n't prepared academically to attend college , and we do n't need those headaches . " <p> Both coaches requested anonymity in the belief that fellow coaches would ostracize them . <p> Schofield defended the school , saying it employs four part-time teachers who work with the school 's 30 students , all male , and that the school offers a strong curriculum . He said the school affords opportunities to players who otherwise would n't be able to enroll in college . <p> Two current players on the team also said the school offers a legitimate curriculum . The NCAA Clearinghouse , which validates the transcripts of student-athletes for eligibility purposes , approved 35 courses offered by Lutheran Christian , according to the clearinghouse 's Web site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Schofield , referring to the popular youth basketball leagues across the country . " I did n't want to be one of the hypocrites that used the kids and pumped them up all summer and then when they need help , we 're not there for them . " <p> According to Pennsylvania Department of Education records , the school graduated all seven of its seniors in the 2003-04 school year . Schofield said his players have an 80 percent graduation rate from college . <p> " Our success rate of kids graduating from college is very high , probably up there with the percentages of the prep schools in Boston , " Schofield said . " It 's evident that all the kids who have come through our program , they 're doing well academically in college . I could care less about the basketball . Academics are the only thing I care about . " <p> There are more than 1,000 college preparatory schools in the country . The ones with strong athletic programs often enroll players who have completed four years of high school without achieving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basketball at a major university . <p> " Preparatory schools in general are to get kids intensive tutoring and support in an environment that is conducive to doing well academically , and in some cases take advantage of the additional resources that they have athletically to improve themselves , " said Peter Roby , the director of Northwestern University 's Center for the Study of Sport in Society , not speaking specifically about Lutheran Christian . " I do n't think there is anything in the prep schools model that is an issue . " <p> The money at stake in a young basketball player 's career has made the schools attractive to players whose academic shortcomings would otherwise detour their athletic careers and knock them out of the development chain . That could be the difference between that player going on to college , being drafted in the NBA and earning a multimillion dollar contract , and falling out of the talent pipeline . <p> A player can repair his qualifications at a prep school in two ways : The NCAA admits student-athletes on a combination of grade-point average and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his GPA , the lower test score he needs and vice-versa . A player with a 2.5 GPA needs an 820 SAT score , for instance . <p> Nearly 100 college scouts attended the first two days of the National Prep School Invitational tournament this weekend at Keaney Gymnasium on the University of Rhode Island campus . Teams from 13 states and Canada competed , and the recruiters each paid $200 for a tournament program that consisted of little more than photocopied rosters . <p> Lutheran Christian , with 18 players from five states , the District and Canada , clearly was one of the most talented teams in the tournament . Theo Davis , a 6-foot-9 forward from Toronto , is being recruited by Gonzaga , Michigan and Texas-El Paso , according to Schofield . Michael Scott , a point guard from Philadelphia , has been offered scholarships by Rice , Columbia , George Washington and Jacksonville . Lawrence Williams , an imposing 6-8 forward from Brooklyn , N.Y. , already has decided he will attend Texas El-Paso on a scholarship , Schofield said . <p> Among the Lutheran Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of the No. 8 Colonials ' top reserve players , spent one year at the school after he failed to graduate from a public school in Philadelphia and abruptly left a more established preparatory school in North Carolina . <p> " I never saw him in a game , just saw him in a couple of workouts . My thing about him was , I kept asking myself , ' Why is n't everybody killing to get this kid ? ' " George Washington Coach Karl Hobbs said . " I thought something was wrong . I thought I was missing something , like he was a crazy kid . I trust his high school coach and his coach told me , ' Give this kid a chance and I promise you 'll be happy . ' I do n't know much about the school . I 'm just happy we gave him the opportunity . " <p> Rice could not be reached for comment . <p> Georgetown freshman Marc Egerson played last year at Lutheran Christian after failing to graduate from Glasgow High School in Newark , Del @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not comment for this report . <p> In addition to Georgetown and George Washington , Lutheran Christian has sent players to Mississippi State , Massachusetts and Temple , among others , even though the school does n't even have a gymnasium . <p> The community center belongs to Helping Energize and Rebuild Ourselves Inc. , a nonprofit . The only sign of the school inside is a framed picture of the basketball team hanging on a wall . The single-story building has bars on its windows and graffiti markings etched over its red-painted exterior , but it 's still the cornerstone of its neighborhood . <p> Down the street , the Resurrection Life Church looks as if it is in need of salvation ; the doors are boarded , and a sign states that it will reopen " sometime in 2006 . " Directly across the street from HERO is an abandoned apartment building , with seven stories of shattered windows . <p> The community center has about seven rooms , two of which are used by the school , center director Doris Phillips said . Grade-schoolers take computer classes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yesterday , a child 's birthday party was being held there . <p> Lutheran Christian has used the center for more than three years , Phillips said . She said she has seen about 20 male students and one teacher arrive on weekdays at 9 a.m. and spend about five hours in HERO 's banquet hall . Yesterday the room was set up a little like a classroom , but there were no desks . The room is filled with several white plastic tables , with two chairs pushed into each table . Phillips said that some weeks Lutheran Christian holds school five days . Other weeks , Phillips said , the students come three or four times . <p> " We do n't get too involved in the school . It all happens through Schofield , " Phillips said . " We try to help them as much as we can by giving them space , but they pretty much just come and go . With their basketball schedule , you never know when you 'll see them . " <p> Phillips said Schofield uses the banquet hall for about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school moves into a small computer lab down the hall . <p> " I know they have a lot of recruiters come and talk to them and stuff like that , " Phillips said . " And then they have some school lessons . " <p> Schofield , 37 , said he was a sanitation worker for the city of Philadelphia before opening the school with David Anwar , now the director of basketball operations at Texas El-Paso . Schofield said he has an associate 's degree from Thaddeus Stevens , a two-year community college in Lancaster , Pa . <p> Lutheran Christian is licensed as a religious institution by the Pennsylvania Department of Education , which reports on its database that the school opened Sept. 1 , 2003 . Schofield said the school is currently not directly affiliated with a church . <p> Schofield said the school has four part-time instructors : two former players with bachelor 's degrees who returned to teach at Lutheran Christian and two women . One of them , Tamara Casey , has listed her residence as one of the houses Schofield said he owns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courses . Property records show that house is owned by Schofield 's parents . When asked for the name of the second instructor , Schofield could n't recall it , calling her " Mrs. Robinson . " None of the players he asked could remember Robinson 's first name , either . <p> Casey and Robinson could not be reached for comment . <p> Lutheran Christian guard Delonte Taylor , from H.D. Woodson High , said he enrolled at the school on the recommendation of his cousin , Chris Matthews , a former player at the school and now a freshman at Washington State . Matthews played three seasons at National Christian Academy before transferring to Schofield 's school . Taylor said he had a 3.66 GPA at H.D. Woodson , but did n't earn a qualifying score on standardized tests . Taylor said Lutheran Christian has helped him prepare to take the tests . <p> " The experience is great , " Taylor said . " Basketball-wise , it 's a lot more advanced than the D.C. public schools . The schoolwork is , too . " <p> Guard David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior at Crossland High School , is enrolled at Lutheran Christian as a junior this year . Tairu said he had a 2.189 GPA in high school and scored 720 on the SAT . By dropping back to his junior year at the academy , Tairu can retake some of his core courses and submit the new grades to the NCAA Clearinghouse . <p> " It 's a legitimate school , " Tairu said . " It 's a second chance for me . It 's a blessing to be here . " <p> James Woodson , who has worked the front desk at HERO for five years , said he used to hold a 30-minute session each morning about how to dress and act . " Nobody would ever listen or pay attention , " Woodson said . " I gave up a year or two ago . Now Schofield is the only one who works with them . " <p> Schofield said Lutheran Christian teaches each of its 35 courses , including English , psychology , sociology , geometry , trigonometry , chemistry and Spanish and French , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must pass an exam at the end of each pace , scoring 80 percent or better , before moving on to the next level , Schofield said . <p> Schofield said tuition is $5,000 but he normally receives only $2,000 , which includes room and board for nonlocal students . Schofield said he earns about $7,000 working as the school 's basketball coach and also works as a cook at a restaurant during the week . Schofield said the school has " tons and tons " of crates of books used for instruction , and said the school recently upgraded its computer lab to include 12 flat-screen computers and new educational software . <p> Phillips said the new computers were obtained by the center , not the school , with the help of a Pennsylvania congressman . And the former player , who attended the school for three months , said the school did n't have computers and did n't use textbooks in its instruction . <p> The former player and his mother both agreed to be interviewed for this story but later asked not to be identified for fear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my teacher , " the former player said . " You would walk in this room about the size of a Foot Locker store and he 'd hand you a gray booklet about the size of composition book . He 'd say , ' Read it or you 're not playing . ' I never saw any computers . I saw some books laying around there , but we never used them . Schofield was there sometimes . " <p> The former player 's mother said she worried her son was n't doing much at the school other than playing basketball . <p> " I was trying to figure out if the kids were going to school , " the former player 's mother said . " When I 'd ask her son how school was going , he 'd say he only had one teacher . I asked him who the teacher was and he said , ' Schofield . ' " <p> The former player said he enrolled at Lutheran Christian after Schofield promised a disciplined , rigorous academic program that enabled his players to improve their academics and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told the former player , that each of the players who had graduated from the school played basketball in college . <p> Instead , the former player and his mother said , they found an unstructured academic environment . The former player and his mother said nearly a dozen of the school 's basketball players lived in a cramped apartment owned by Schofield . She said the apartment lacked sufficient heat and the players had to turn on the oven and open the door to heat the room . <p> Schofield said his players never lacked heat and he often spends more than $500 a month heating their residences . He said yesterday that the players now live in three properties . <p> " It was n't what I thought it was going to be , " said the former player , who now attends another college preparatory school . " I thought it was going to be an opportunity to get my grades up and get more exposure to college coaches . But it ended up being a big step back . " <p> Schofield said most of the basketball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and former players . Schofield said he interviews the player and his parents or guardians and decides whether to admit them . If the player has severe academic deficiencies , he can still be admitted if he produces positive character references . " I do n't turn anybody down , " Schofield said . <p> The Post obtained the transcript of one player who enrolled at Lutheran . The player left high school as a junior after the 2003-04 school year . He had repeated the ninth grade and had a 1.33 GPA in the core courses in English , math , hard science and social sciences the NCAA requires for initial athletic eligibility at a four-year college . <p> According to the transcript , the player made grades of C or better in only three of the 14 core courses needed for initial eligibility and had not yet made the minimum score needed on the SAT or ACT . During one academic year at Lutheran Christian , the player passed six core courses , making four grades of A and two of B. He also scored high enough on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Schofield said Rice had similar academic problems when he enrolled at Lutheran Christian . <p> " When we first started , we had to take the kids no one else wanted , " Schofield said . " When we started , I was a little afraid myself because I grew up in the inner city . But those were the kids we had to save . We butted heads every day for about a year . But it was the right thing to do , so why fix it if it is n't broken ?
