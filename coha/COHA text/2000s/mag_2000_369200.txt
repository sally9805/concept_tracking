It was a great year for cracking codes , man 's and nature 's alike . The scientific high point of the year  --  if not of all intellectual history  --  was the decoding of human DNA , announced with much fanfare at the White House in late June by two scientists , J. Craig Venter and Francis Collins , whose agreement to share the credit and a podium was all the more remarkable because they can hardly stand to breathe the same air . Passions were no less intense on the Internet , where the music industry fought a rear-guard action against the forces  --  and free music  --  unleashed by an 18-year-old named Shawn Fanning and a piece of computer code he called Napster . Or on the front lines of the agritech wars , where the opponents of so-called Frankenfoods stirred a tempest in a taco shell when genetically engineered feed corn not deemed safe for human consumption ( because it might cause allergic reactions ) turned up at Taco Bells and other outposts in the human food supply . It was big year in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astronauts took occupancy of the new space station , and astronomers ( armed with a new generation of smart telescopes and a fleet of clever space-going robots ) snapped brilliantly sharp pictures of fire storms on the sun and watermarks on Mars , and brought the number of planets discovered outside our solar system to nearly 50 . Closer to home , this was the year they cloned a pig , approved an abortion pill and took saccharin off the list of known carcinogens . It was also the year that gene therapy , having shown promise in treating a pair of French " bubble boys , " suffered its first casualty  --  a brave young patient named Jesse Gelsinger , who underwent the experimental gene transplant not to save himself but to help other youngsters suffering , as he had been , from congenital disorders . <P>  --  Philip Elmer-DeWitt <P> Home and Away <P> Touching down on the West Side of Manhattan in late winter was a wondrous new vehicle for transport to the stars : the Hayden Planetarium , centerpiece of the $210 million Rose Center for Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hayden 's core seemed to float inside a 10-story glass-walled cube , which is the Hayden 's outer shell . " A cosmic cathedral , " was how architect James Polshek proudly described his creation . A planetarium is , of course , only a transmitter of outer space to those of us on terra firma . By contrast , the new space station , a U.S.-led international effort that has already cost some $60 billion , is to be a constant outpost in the heavens . It hosted its first party of astro- and cosmonauts in the fall , and progress was monitored on the big screen at mission control in Moscow . In mid-November Russia 's space program announced it was finally decommissioning its tattered , battered old station , Mir .
