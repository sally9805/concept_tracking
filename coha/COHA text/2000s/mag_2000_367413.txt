Reverse Seneca 's famous maxim  --  Ars longa , vita brevis  --  and you come up with a pretty fair description of many big , fat , fact-crammed current biographies : life is long , art short . Such narrative behemoths can , of course , contain much of value , particularly for readers who are passionately curious about the subjects . Admirers of Mary McCarthy , for example , would not wish Frances Kiernan 's recent , well-received Seeing Mary Plain : A Life of Mary McCarthy any shorter than its 768 pages . But what of those who are interested in learning more about the life of a notable person but unwilling to sacrifice a significant swatch of their own lives in the quest ? <P> Such a question occurred a few years ago to James Atlas , 51 , who was , oddly enough , working on a long biography of Saul Bellow at the time . ( Some 10 years in the making , the book is scheduled for publication this fall . ) While jogging in Manhattan 's Central Park , Atlas experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be short biographies by great writers .

' I 've been really fascinated by her since I was a little girl . " Although she was teaching at Barnard College and working on a novel , she does not begrudge the year and a half she spent on Joan of Arc .
