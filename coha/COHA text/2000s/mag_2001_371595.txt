In the first moments after American Airlines Flight 587 went down last Monday , the unthinkable seemed to be happening again : an airliner crashes in New York City , Air Force fighters scramble , tunnels are closed , the Empire State Building is evacuated , and the United Nations is locked down . As sirens wailed and hundreds of fire fighters converged on the scene , 8 million New Yorkers tensed with a fear that they were still in the terrorists ' cross hairs . " Be brave ... Stay calm , " urged Mayor Rudy Giuliani , reprising a sickeningly familiar role as a dozen homes blazed around him . <P> Within hours , authorities began to downplay terrorism as a possible cause of the crash , and the National Transportation Safety Board  --  not the FBI  --  took charge of the investigation . " All information we have currently is that this is an accident , " said NTSB chairwoman Marion Blakey on Monday  --  and every day throughout the week . For many families , though , what was no longer unthinkable still became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic convulsed in midair , flinging away its tail and engines and augering into the Rockaway Peninsula in Queens , just across Jamaica Bay from John F. Kennedy International Airport . The crash killed all 260 people on board and five on the ground  --  the worst toll for a U.S. carrier since another American flight crashed in Chicago in 1979 , killing 275  --  and it set ablaze several blocks of the seaside community of Belle Harbor . <P> In the gruesome recalibration of catastrophe that we have made since Sept. 11 , the assumption that Flight 587 was an accident brought some measure of relief to the city and the nation . Yet days later , relief turned to apprehension across a country poised for its busiest week in the air . How did a jetliner with a solid safety record , maintained by the nation 's biggest airline and flown in perfect weather by two experienced pilots , break into pieces less than 3 min. after takeoff ? What would cause the tail of a plane that has been thoroughly tested for years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or are American 's 34 remaining A300s susceptible ? <P> The answers will not be known for months , but in the meantime the Federal Aviation Administration late last week began to focus on the rudder-and-tail assembly , which is made of a carbon-fiber composite rather than the metal used in most jets . The FAA ordered an inspection of the tail section of all Airbus 300s as well as the smaller 310s . American is the only U.S. passenger airline to fly A300s , although UPS and FedEx also use them . <P> Flight 587 was full when it left J.F.K. at 9:14 a.m. , in contrast to the half-empty planes leaving from much of the country . Dominicans may move to the U.S. for a better life , but they love their homeland , and AA 587 was a virtual shuttle service between those two worlds . It was highly profitable for American , because it had no direct competition . It was filled with families such as Mariana and Lasar Flores and their son Isaiah , 2 , on their way to visit Mariana 's sister . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a visit to New York City , where she had worked for many years .
