The House of Saint Glinda So the talk of random brutality was n't just talk . At noontime they discovered the bodies of three young women , out on some mission of conversion that appeared to have gone awry . The novice maunts had been strangled by their ropes of holy beads , and their faces removed . Her nerve being shaken at last , Oatsie Manglehand now caved in to the demands of her paying customers . She told the team drivers they 'd pause only long enough to dig some shallow graves while the horses slaked their thirst . Then the caravan would press on across the scrubby flats known , for the failed farmsteads abandoned here and there , as the Disappointments . Moving by night , at least they would n't make a sitting target , though they might as easily wander into trouble as sidestep it . Still , Oatsie 's party was antsy . Hunker down all night and wait for horse hoofs , spears ? Too hard on everyone . Oatsie consoled herself : If the caravan kept moving , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of the carping , the second-guessing , the worrying . With the benefit of height , therefore , Oatsie spotted the gully before anyone else did . The cloudburst at sunset had fed a small trackside rivulet that flowed around a flank of skin , water-lacquered in the new moonlight . An island , she feared , of human flesh . I ought to turn aside before the others notice , she thought ; how much more can they take ? There is nothing I can do for that human soul . The digging of another trench would require an hour , minimum . An additional few moments for prayers . The project would only further agitate these clients as they obsess about their own precious mortality . Upon the knee of the horizon balanced the head of a jackal moon , so-called because , once every generation or so , a smear of celestial flotsam converged behind the crescent moon of early autumn . The impact was creepy , a look of a brow and a snout . As the moon rounded out over a period of weeks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheeks bulging . Always a fearsome sight , the jackal moon tonight spooked Oatsie Manglehand further . Do n't stop for this next casualty . Get through the Disappointments , deliver these paying customers to the gates of the Emerald City.But she resisted giving in to superstition . Be scared of the real jackals , she reminded herself , not frets and nocturnal portents . In any case , the light of the constellation alleviated some of the color blindness that sets in at night . The body was pale , almost luminous . Oatsie might divert the Grasstrail Train and give the corpse a wide berth before anyone else noticed it , but the slope of the person 's shoulders , the unnatural twist of legs  --  the jackal moon made her read the figure too well , as too clearly human , for her to be able to turn aside . " Nubb , " she barked to her second , " rein in . We 'll pull into flank formation up that rise . There 's another fatality , there in the runoff . " Cries of alarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutiny : Why should they stop ?  --  were they to bear witness to every fresh atrocity ? Oatsie did n't listen . She yanked the reins of her team of horses , to halt them , and she lowered herself gingerly . She stumped , her hand on her sore hip , until she stood a few feet over the body . Face down and genitals hidden , he appeared to have been a young man . A few scraps of fabric were still knotted about his waist , and a boot some yards distant , but he was otherwise naked , and no sign of his clothes . Curious : no evidence of the assassins . Neither had there been about the bodies of the maunts , but that was on rockier ground , in a drier hour . Oatsie could n't see any sign of scuffle here , and in the mud of the gulch one might have expected . . . something . The body was n't bloody , nor decayed yet ; the murder was recent . Perhaps this evening , perhaps only an hour ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if they 've taken his face , " she said . " No blood , " said Nubb . " Blood may have run off in that cloudburst . Steel yourself , now . " They got on either side of the body and bit their lips . She looked at Nubb , meaning : It 's only the next thing , it 's not the last thing . Let 's get through this , fellow . She jerked her head in the direction of the hoist . One , two , heave . They got him up . His head had fallen into a natural scoop in the stone , a few inches higher than where the rain had pooled . His face was intact , more or less ; that is to say , it was still there , though shattered . " How did he get here ? " said Nubb . " And why did n't they scrape him ? " Oatsie just shook her head . She settled on her haunches . Her travelers had come forward and were congregating on the rise behind her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had gathered stones , and were ready to kill her if she insisted on a burial . The jackal moon rose a few notches higher , as if trying to see into the gulley . The prurience of the heavens ! " We 're not going to dig another grave . " That from her noisiest client , a wealthy trader from the northern Vinkus . " Not his , Oatsie Manglehand , and not yours , either . We 're not doing it . We leave him unburied and alone , or we leave him unburied with your corpse for company . " " We do n't need to do either , " said Oatsie . She sighed . " Poor , poor soul , whoever he is . He needs no grave . He is n't dead yet . " In time , when the travelers had rejoined their cronies and relatives in the Emerald City  --  in salons , in public houses , in taverns of exchange  --  they heard more chatter about the hostilities they had managed to sidestep . Rumor flourished . Forty , sixty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scrow and the Yunamata . Barbarians , the lot of them:They deserved to kill off each other . But not us.
