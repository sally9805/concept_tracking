The shelled corn bin was like a huge box over the alleyway of the corncrib . Millions of crisp and yellow corn kernels , ten feet deep , and tell feet square at the top . The boys liked to dive into it , letting it sting their hands and faces as they squirmed until they almost disappeared into the golden wonder of it all . <p> Sometimes they pretended it was quicksand , swaying back and forth in it as they slowly sank down to their armpits , and another one of them would fling them a rope in this great but pretend rescue mission . <p> None of this was dangerous . But the boys were told not to play in the shelled corn bin when it was being emptied . You could get sucked down in a whirlpool of shelled corn . You could get buried in corn so far that you would n't be able to get out . You could choke . You could drown in corn is what could happen . You 'd be four feet under the corn before the corn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bin was full . Then what ? Nobody would know what happened to you . If a boy disappeared , people always looked in the wells and cisterns first to see if he had fallen in . But who would think of looking for a boy in the middle of a big corn bin ? It might be months before anybody found you . And then you 'd probably be half-eaten by rats . <p> The youngest boy knew that the problem with doing something you 're not supposed to do when the other boys were around was that one of them would always tell  --  and blame him . They 'd say that it was the youngest boy 's idea . It 's not our fault , they 'd say . We tried to stop him , they 'd say . <p> So the youngest boy waited until none of the other boys were watching to go play in the shelled corn bin while it was being emptied into a large wagon beneath it in the corncrib alley . <p> At first the moving grain was like a golden funnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle was like the center of the flour in a sifter as it slowly indented , or the way the center of a milkshake caves in if you have the straw in the middle . Then he saw the corn start to swirl a little . This is where the grown-ups got that whirlpool idea . But it was no fun if you could n't feel the kernels of corn moving against your body . There was no way a person could drown in shelled corn , he knew that . It was just another one of those things grown-ups said to keep kids scared . So the youngest boy jumped into the middle of the whirlpool of shelled corn . It was great . It was like having somebody rubbing you softly with a backscratcher all over your body . Gently scratching you and turning you over at the same time . He lay back and moved his arms the way he would if he were trying to swim on his back . The moving and gently swirling yellow corn was a million little fingers moving across his body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something grabbed both of his feet from the bottom and started pulling . He thought of the time he hooked a big mud turtle on his fishing line and slowly dragged the stubborn weight to shore . Now he was the mud turtle and something was pulling him . He tried moving his legs the way he would if he were running , but the suction from the opening at the bottom of the corn bin was pulling him down . His hands were still free , and he beat at the corn with them , but all of the kernels were working together now , working against him , working to pull him down under . At first it was the corn dust in his nostrils and eyes , and then the sting of the kernels on his face . He tried to take a deep breath . And could n't . <p> It was as if his body exploded then , and light came back as quickly as it had gone out . He pushed corn away from his face and rolled with the swirl of the corn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and over the way a log might turn over on the surface of water , but with his arms moving all the while , beating at the corn as he pulled himself against the suction . And then the sucking stopped . <p> He crawled out of the half-empty corn bin and looked down at what he had conquered . <p> I 'm not four feet under the corn , choked , dead , and drowned , he said to himself That was n't so bad , he said to himself I could do that again if I wanted to . <p> He stood up and looked down at what he had survived , more proud of himself than he had ever been in his life . He looked around smiling , ready for applause and praise . But there was no one to either punish him for doing what he was not supposed to have done , nor to praise him for surviving the sucking corn . <p> All right , he said to himself . All right , all right , he said again and again , trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this . <p> <p> By Jim Heynen <p>
