( Tice appears carrying a small lantern . He is dressed in an old hospital gown , one that closes in the back and could be from any era . He is barefoot ) TICE HOGAN Damn . Hope this is the right place . Well , it 'll have to do ' cause I 'm not about to make this trip twice . Facts is , I 'm still warm . Though if I 'd taken the time to get dressed , that little window , and you know what window I mean , would 've come down with a bang and who knows when I 'd 've had another chance . ( beat ) Strange thing is , there 's no glass in that window . Whole things made of ice . The sill so cold when you put your knee up on it to climb through , your bones turn black with the shock . And then you just . Fall on through . And none of that slow motion elegant gliding through black nothingness either , but shot through the air like a raisin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picking the shit of heaven out my ears like a new-born . Least I think it was heaven . Though I passed through so quick it could 've been hell . I saw three things on my journey : a chick-a-dee with a cow 's tongue , a wheelbarrow hauling a city , and my own bare ass flashing by in the eye of a beetle.There 's something biblical there but I ca n't yet put my finger on it . I think it 's the three . Because I came here , with such speed and undignified travel to talk with you about three things.One : There is always a knock at the door . And you know it 's the knock at the door that you 've been telling yourself you have n't been waiting for all your life , that it 's just like yesterdays knock on the door , or the day before . But this knock is different . Not by its sound but by the way it opens up a hole inside you and you start to cave in . And all the while you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're getting up , real calm , and going to the door to open it.Two : If you eat enough apples and save the seeds , which is no easy thing because they 're small and slippery little bastards , you will discover , as I did , how many seeds it takes to fill the human hand.Three : A good friend is not an apple seed . A good friend does not fit in the human hand . A good friend does not knock at the door . A good friend is not a dinner plate , nor a piece of string . ( beat ) p. 3 Imagine the treasures a man learns in a lifetime.Now close your eyes . But watch the back of your lids ' cause what I saw in my short time was not what I held in my arms ; what I spoke was not the weight I felt on my tongue ; what I touched I touched in the dark even when the world was lit up as bright as a furnace . ( Takes clothes off the back of a chair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaks ) . @x ( A simple wooden table in an almost bare room . Stillness . Tice stands reading a small book . A splitting log rolls onto the stage , slowly , and comes to rest in the room . He regards it , but then returns to reading . After a moment , a smaller log rolls in after it and comes to a rest . Stillness . Then Cali appears with an ax . Cali 's shoes do n't quite match , but she wears them well . Cali sets the ax on the table ) CALI HOGAN It 's not Saturday today . TICE HOGAN I believe it is . CALI HOGAN No . It 's Friday . TICE HOGAN I 'm reading . Are you reading ? CALI HOGAN No . I 'm swingin ' an ax . This was your Friday to do it . Last Friday was too . ( Cali watches her father a few moments as he continues reading . Then she picks up the smaller log , places it on the larger , and picks up the ax ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 'll bring us bad luck . CALI HOGAN You do n't believe in luck . TICE HOGAN That 's cause luck never believed in me . ( Cali swings the ax and splits the wood in one easy motion ) p. 6 TICE HOGAN Damn . Arms are getting thick , girl . That 's good . Strong . Men do n't like it . But you 're never one to care . CALI HOGAN Guess what I found in one of the sheets today ? TICE HOGAN A lady 's slipper . A gentleman 's belt . CALI HOGAN A blue ribbon . Look . ( Cali has a blue ribbon in her hair ) TICE HOGAN Stealing 's  --  CALI HOGAN A sin . And it 's this little bit of sin that reminds me to be good . TICE HOGAN But the colour is not for you , it 's too CALI HOGAN I 'm keepin ' it . TICE HOGAN All right . Then write a letter . Ask instead of steal . Write : Could I have the ribbon that I found in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' but my pay . TICE HOGAN How would Marx consider this situation ? CALI HOGAN He 'd say if you find a ribbon when you 're washing out their soil , then take it and wear it . TICE HOGAN Actually , I think he 'd say save your resistance for the larger battles . Stealing ribbons is not one of them . Now , if you took to smuggling some of our flyers in those sheets like your good friend Estelle does  --  p. 7 CALI HOGAN I wo n't work for your party . TICE HOGAN Well . A dead husband will not notice a ribbon anyway . And myself , I 'd rather read . CALI HOGAN My husband may be dead but his eyes are open . Always did like to watch the world . But he does n't need a fire to do it . You 're the one who needs the fire day and night . ( Cali throws the ax down ) My arms are thick . Your arms ? Out of work . You used to have steel for arms . Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long does to a man : thins the muscle . A bird could land on your arm just like a wire . ( Tice closes his book ) TICE HOGAN You need some air , my daughter . It 's Friday night . Go on down to the Joy Boy club and dance with the girls . Do some fast foot . Shake out that sag . Look at the men . You 're not old yet . CALI HOGAN Old enough to know that one 's the same as the next . TICE HOGAN Find one and change him . Fix him just like you like it . CALI HOGAN Stones do n't change . TICE HOGAN A man is not a stone . CALI HOGAN I 'm not talkin ' about a man . I 'm talkin ' about me. p. 8 TICE HOGAN No , no . You 're wrong , girl . It 's happening all the time . Even inside of you . Me , look what I 've molded myself into ? I could n't even sing as a child and now : ( Tice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his choir ) Top of the choir . Sometimes I even think if you just look at a thing long enough , it will change , just out of spite . Sit down . I 'll read to you . CALI HOGAN From which book ? TICE HOGAN Does it matter ? CALI HOGAN I 've got to finish stacking wood . Soup for dinner . TICE HOGAN Unit meeting at Tucker 's house tonight . You can come . Getting a block relief committee together to push for cash wages , ' stead of scrip . The six of us . I might sing , too . CALI HOGAN I 've got work . TICE HOGAN Unlike the women and men that 'll be there . Relief projects started on the new Park . But only for scrip . CALI HOGAN Do n't start . TICE HOGAN No cash , forced to shop at high priced shops  --  CALI HOGAN Here , take this ribbon and give it to your saddest unemployed . ( She takes the ribbon from her hair ) p. 9 TICE HOGAN No . It looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're not happy . CALI HOGAN I do n't ask to be happy . Be happy for that . I just want to be left . Alone . Here with you . It 's all right . The world 's out there . Hungry , it can stay there . ( Tice holds up the ribbon ) TICE HOGAN Things could be different . CALI HOGAN Old man . Now you make me sad . TICE HOGAN Look . It 's just a ribbon , see ? But now , watch , it 's a blue thing that floats a little while . ( He lets the ribbon flutter slowly to the floor . They both look at the ribbon ) CALI HOGAN A little while . ( Cali snatches it up ) That 's not long enough for me. end scene one p. 10 Act 1 , Scene 2 SCENE TWO ( Cali enters carrying a large bundle of clean sheets , which she then dumps on the table . She contemplates the bundle , sits before it and then quickly hides her head under the sheets . Tice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her head lost in the sheets . He quietly puts down his lunch box and a huge book on the far end of the table ) CALI HOGAN You coming to help me fold these sheets or creep back over to Tucker 's to study your book . TICE HOGAN Former . ( Cali rises and begins to disentangle a sheet ) CALI HOGAN Could you move your box and that oversized mounting block . ( Tice removes them from the table . They begin to fold the sheets together , neatly stacking them on the table ) CALI HOGAN You know what Rosie says about men with enormous bibles ? TICE HOGAN Nope , and neither do I want to hear it from my daughter . Rosie does n't think , let alone talk like that . Not about me anyway . CALI HOGAN She does . TICE HOGAN She does n't . CALI HOGAN No , she doesn't. p. 11 TICE HOGAN She does n't , really ? CALI HOGAN No , but she was round here earlier , lookin ' all biblical and ready for some Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't say much so what she does say will be significant . CALI HOGAN I wonder if I could have some sugar , Cali girl . That 's all she said . TICE HOGAN Well , it stands to reason . CALI HOGAN You 're disappointed . TICE HOGAN I 'd have to have some expectations to be disappointed . I do n't have any expectations regarding  --  CALI HOGAN But she did look all around here and it were n't for sugar since I had that covered . ( Cali pulls the sheet hard and Tice loses grip . It settles on the table . Tice regards his end . Cali waits . Tice studies her . He then picks up the sheet ) CALI HOGAN She looked all around as if searchin ' , sniffin ' even . TICE HOGAN Sniffing ? CALI HOGAN And her mouth all open . TICE HOGAN Open ? CALI HOGAN With expectation . Kind of . A mouth open as if waitin ' to be filled by  --  p. 12 TICE HOGAN For the final time , I know where you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not from my daughter . ( Cali picks up the bible and lets it drop onto the table ) CALI HOGAN A man carryin ' this is n't going anywhere in a hurry . TICE HOGAN But you forget the other book . Made for travelling . CALI HOGAN So ditch the heavyweight . TICE HOGAN A Sunday school teacher must know his students . And those two books agree on a number of points . CALI HOGAN Do unto others as you would have them do unto you . TICE HOGAN Number one rule , and if we 'd all do unto others- CALI HOGAN And that gets us right back to Rosie ( Tice begins humming so as not to hear Cali ) and what she wants to do unto you and  --  TICE HOGAN Those sheets always do this to you , I swear . CALI HOGAN And what you want to do unto her except you 're too big a coward . TICE HOGAN Now you know I 've tried my share of women over the years . Just did n't work out . p. 13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not listening any further . CALI HOGAN Offering you her sugar posy . TICE HOGAN I 'm not listening . CALI HOGAN You 're dryin ' up into a set of words , all marching along a straight and narrow road . TICE HOGAN If I 'm marching it 's to a tune your mother first put in my ear . When justice gets ahold of you like that  --  wrapped up in your ear drum  --  you ca n't ever let it go . CALI HOGAN And Rosie ? And her posy ? TICE HOGAN What with the party , the Sunday teaching , the choir , couple days a week digging for the park , my days and much of my nights are stuffed to bursting and then there 's you and me . We fill my space just fine . CALI HOGAN What , I got to go for you to taste Rosie 's sugar posy ? TICE HOGAN I come home to relax . You 're running me into the ground with this Rosie business . ( Cali picks up the pile of sheets but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read to himself . He looks up at Cali . She raises an eyebrow ) TICE HOGAN What now ? ( Cali just waits ) p. 14 TICE HOGAN Okay . I wo n't mention a husband again . You made your point . ( Cali smiles and leaves with the washing ) TICE HOGAN ( chants quietly to himself as he reads ) Rosie , Rosie , Rosie , offering her sugar posy . end scene two p. 15 Act 1 , Scene 3 SCENE THREE ( It is night . Tice is asleep in a chair . Two short , sharp knocks are heard at the door . Tice stirs but does n't wake . Cali enters , alert , and listens for some moments . She stands close to the door , listening , but all is silent . She 's uncertain if she heard anything . She returns to her father . ) CALI HOGAN You asleep ? ( Tice does not stir . ) That 's good . ( Cali carefully opens the Bible . She tears out a page , slowly , so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but sleeps on ) Forgive me father for I have sinned . ( Cali tears out another page , but in short bursts so it tears differently ) Twice so far . Here goes a third . ( Cali tears out a third page in a different manner from the other two ) That 's a kinder music , Lord . Forgive me . He wo n't know it cause he only goes to his earmarked pages . When he wakes he wo n't be missin ' somethin ' he does n't know he had . ( Beat ) And I need it to wipe ' cause he wo n't let me use the party newspaper . ( Cali puts the torn pages into her pocket , then stands over her father ) I 'm goin ' to bed . You still asleep ? ( Cali lightly brushes his hair once , but does n't want to wake him ) Still a handsome man . But I ca n't remember her like you do cause I was only six but she must of loved you up ' til you could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find it again . What was it like , Daddy , to be loved like that ? Must have given you a hope . Problem with hope is it gets you lookin ' way past the out there . You could be crawlin ' on coals and not even know it. I lied to you , I 'm sorry . My husband 's eyes are not open in his grave . They were closed when he lived and closed when he died . At least to me . You ever have a hand touch you like it was touchin ' a table , or reachin ' for a bowl of soup ? Then you 'd know me. p. 16 end scene three p. 17 Act 1 , Scene 4 SCENE FOUR ( The room is empty . It is still night . There is another knock at the door . After some moments someone knocks again . The knocks are short and precise , not desperate . Tice enters and stands listening to the door . Another knock , but softer . Tice takes a chair and props it under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , who points to the door . Again , a knocking . Cali studies the chair against the door . Then she adds the huge Bible , resting it on the chair seat . Another knock . Cali gives her father a look , then takes the small book from Tice 's shirt pocket and places that on top of the Bible . The knocks sound again ) . CALI HOGAN ( Whispers ) Should we see who it is ? TICE HOGAN It 's after midnight . CALI HOGAN Could be Tucker . TICE HOGAN He sleeps hard . CALI HOGAN Could be Rosie . TICE HOGAN She 's not that bold . CALI HOGAN The Sander 's twins ? Just playin ' ? TICE HOGAN They 're at their Grandma 's in Atlanta . CALI HOGAN I 'm goin ' to open it . p. 18 TICE HOGAN No . Call to them . CALI HOGAN ( Calls ) Who 's out there ? TICE HOGAN ( louder ) Who 's out there ? ! ( No answer ) CALI HOGAN Maybe they 're gone . TICE HOGAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper under the floor . Beat him and his two boys . CALI HOGAN You never said . TICE HOGAN The other night , it was Kelly . Hit his wife too . Broke her jaw . Every third house in the district , police went in swinging hard . ( Again , three knocks ) CALI HOGAN Daddy , there 's no body out there . TICE HOGAN That 's right . CALI HOGAN So let 's get some rest . TICE HOGAN Wo n't be able to sleep now . I 'll just sit the night out . CALI HOGAN Do n't open that door . It 's just the wind . ( Tice sits ) TICE HOGAN The wind . Yeah . CALI HOGAN Call me if you need me . ( Cali exits . The night passes , the soft knocking echoes into the night . Tice puts his head on the table and tries to sleep ) end scene four p. 19 Act 1 , Scene 5 SCENE FIVE ( Early morning . Cali enters with a basket and dumps a dozen single shoes on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a child 's sandal . None of the shoes match . Tice has not slept ) TICE HOGAN What the hell time is it ? CALI HOGAN Time for another pair of shoes . I 've got almost nine months worth here . ( Cali begins to sort the shoes . She lines them up on the floor ) TICE HOGAN You stay in this house today . Whoever was at the door last night might be waiting for us to leave . CALI HOGAN Then I 'll wack him with my shoe . TICE HOGAN Cali . This is no joke . CALI HOGAN I can crack a nut with the heel . Or kill a wasp . ( Cali smacks the shoe heel down hard on the table ) I can pop a skull if I have to . Stop worrying ! TICE HOGAN Cali , Cali , Cali . How do so many shoes end up lost in those sheets you gather and wash ? CALI HOGAN People are careless . TICE HOGAN But why careless with only one shoe ? Why not with both ? p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways , that 's worse than by full . Because when you lose one shoe in the laundry , you 're not even tryin ' . I ca n't stand folks with half measures . TICE HOGAN Then why keep them ? CALI HOGAN Because I do like shoes . ( Cali picks up a shoe . She takes some polish from her pocket and lightly polishes the shoe ) A child 's slipper . This is a sad child . See how the toe has pushed down and made a dent . This is a child that holds onto the ground , afraid of being blown away . And this one ( a man 's bedroom slipper ) . A cold man , and selfish . There 's no imprint in the slipper . He ca n't hardly relax . Jealous the heat in his foot will leave him . Probably by the name of Mr. George . ( A ladies shoe ) Oh I wo n't wear this one . Something bad happened here . A stain on the toe . TICE HOGAN Blood ? CALI HOGAN Worse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . TICE HOGAN Sorrow does n't stain . CALI HOGAN Some kinds do . Here ( another man 's shoe . Cali puts it on her hand like a puppet , and makes up a voice for it ) p. 21 VOICE OF THE SHOE/CALI I 'm still warm inside . Happiness makes you hot . ( Cali nears Tice with the shoe as it talks ) You do n't believe me ? ( Cali puts the shoe near Tice 's face ) Touch my seams , they 're so hot they 're burnin ' . TICE HOGAN I do n't like it when you do this . CALI HOGAN You do n't like it when I do this ? Kiss it . ( Tice does n't respond . Now Cali turns the " puppet " to her own face and talk to herself ) Kiss it , you whore . ( Cali crushes the tip of the shoe into her mouth . For one moment she lets it sit there , then Tice slaps it away to the ground . They are silent some moments ) TICE HOGAN You ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoe than this happy shoe . ( beat ) Touched my neck , my shoulder , as I was carryin ' the sheets out . But I kept movin ' . Turnin ' . Just a few steps ahead . Then out the door . Not this time . No . Not this time . Hey , I 've been thinkin ' ' bout your revolution . TICE HOGAN Thank the Lord . ( Cali takes off one of her own shoes and uses it to talk to the other one ) p. 22 CALI HOGAN And the situation now , before we get the changes , when one of them touches me I say CALI 'S SHOE/CALI Oh , please do n't , sir . I have to hurry . Scurry . Worry . No offence but please just do n't . Just please , please do n't . TICE HOGAN Three hundred other men like me laid off the steel works . If I had that job back , you could quit . CALI HOGAN But when we get those changes , there 's only one thing I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't , sir . ( Cali changes her voice to reflect a new attitude ) I say . Do n't . And if you ever touch me again I 'll rip that shoe lace right out of your mouth , wrap it ' round your tongue and tie your seems up so tight that if you so much as breathe on me again I 'll just go pling , pling and your plug will drop right off . TICE HOGAN Always been a barefoot man , myself . Never really liked to be in shoes . ( Cali sits down and takes off her other shoe . As she speaks , she puts on the discarded man 's shoe , then sorts through the other shoes until she finds a size that fits . She puts these two odd shoes on . They are different shoes but fit well ) . CALI HOGAN Ah , but a different set of shoes will take you the last place you knew you wanted to go . Might not change ourselves , but we can sure change where we 're going . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you think ? Where will they take me ? ( There is a sharp knock at the door . Tice and Cali freeze ) p. 23 TICE HOGAN Cali . Open the door . ( Cali opens the door . Corbin is standing there , dishevelled and dirty ) CORBIN TEEL My name is Corbin Teel . ( Silence between the three of them ) There was a ruckus at the foundry . A fellow caught up with me said you could help me . Hide me out . That you , Tice Hogan , were with the Party . TICE HOGAN What fellow ? CORBIN TEEL Did n't give his name . Just yours . TICE HOGAN I ca n't help you , sir . CORBIN TEEL Just a few days . TICE HOGAN I 'm not with the Party . Dirty reds . Not my style , sir . ( He moves to close the door ) CORBIN TEEL His name was Clyde Johnson . Worked beside me . He saw what happened , gave me your name . TICE HOGAN Clyde Johnson ? Never heard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got nowhere to go . They 'll string me up if they catch me . CALI HOGAN ( quietly ) Close the door , father . CORBIN TEEL Fact is . I hit a man . p. 24 TICE HOGAN How hard ? CORBIN TEEL He 's the foreman . TICE HOGAN With what ? CORBIN TEEL Tennessee Coal and Iron . TICE HOGAN You hit him with what ? CORBIN TEEL With a stick . TICE HOGAN A stick . CORBIN TEEL Three inch wide . TICE HOGAN Did he get back up ? CORBIN TEEL Of iron . They closed down two more blast furnaces . Foreman was layin us off . At random . He picked me . No reason . I hit him , then ran . TICE HOGAN Clyde Johnson does n't work at the foundry . ( Corbin enters the room a couple of steps . He has a limp ) CORBIN TEEL You 're right . It was n't Johnson who talked to me . I got his name from the fellow who sent me . TICE HOGAN And his name you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Clyde Johnson , said you might help me .

( Corbin notices the pile of shoes on the floor ) No decent shoes . p. 25 TICE HOGAN Too dangerous . They find you here , TCI police . They 're more law than the law . CALI HOGAN They 'd kill us all . CORBIN TEEL A couple nights . I 'll stay hid . TICE HOGAN Let me be frank . CORBIN TEEL No one saw me come here . TICE HOGAN Firstly , you 're of a white persuasion so we ca n't be in the same house . CORBIN TEEL This fellow swore you 'd help me  --  TICE HOGAN Secondly , I can risk my own life if I take you in , but not my daughter 's . CORBIN TEEL He said . TICE HOGAN You have to leave . Immediately . Please . CORBIN TEEL ( continues )  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you that I 'd go turn myself in to the police and then get leniency by saying you , Tice Hogan , put me up to attacking the foreman because ( Corbin makes a slow and carefully remembered list ) you 're a dirty , red , crime-animal anarchtic ,  --  TICE HOGAN That 'd be criminal anarchist. p. 26 CORBIN TEEL Free-leaving , TICE HOGAN ' Free-loving ' CORBIN TEEL foreign born , exploding Jew TICE HOGAN exploiting CORBIN TEEL Exploiting Jew , feeding off colored ignorance and excavating lurid sex TICE HOGAN Advocating CORBIN TEEL Advocating lurid sex betweenNegroes TICE HOGAN Niggers CORBIN TEEL Yeah , and white women .

Tice comes in with a bowl of hot cereal and sits to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly sips his cereal . Corbin stands up and begins to inch his way over to the table ) CORBIN TEEL Mornin ' . ( Tice answers with a long slurp ) Floor 's all right . Kind of soft , almost . I appreciate it . ( Tice begins to scrape with his spoon ) I 'd pay you board but I got no money . Had some . Not much . A drink . A knuckle of bread . They say you 're for the workin ' man , colored and white . Speakin ' for the jobless , organizin ' for work relief . That the Party 's the only place in Birmingham where men like me and you sit at the same table . Where the colored man can speak against the white man if he 's done wrong , even kick him out the Party if he acts with disrespect . No other place like that . Well I 'm jobless now .

Hard times hit , they dumped our wages , over and over ' til the money they put in my hand . Well . ( He holds his empty hand out ) Added up to that . But I still hung on . Signed a yellow-dog contract , fixed rate , said yes to no union . But we got laid off anyhow . Then on down here to Alabama .

How ' bout this : First day , steel plant , twenty three years ago . I was just shoving sand , pushing boards , but the second day on the floor : molding . I had my own floor , twelve feet wide , twenty feet long . I set my molds in a row , my walkway between the molds . They showed me everything , how to make the sand , how to line my mold . It was a first-class skilled job , molding . I was making a 4 inch tee and a 4 inch ell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not paid much . But I was goood . And that 's good spelled with three o 's when two is n't enough . But I was n't a road man . That 's a hot-shot fellow who can put up more molds than the average man . That was Joe Holton . Now he was a road man . CORBIN TEEL White ? TICE HOGAN Nah . And he was n't full of muscle but he had arms were n't made of bone . No , what run through Holton 's flesh was steel pipe , that strong . But every dip was a ladle of molten iron , and that ladle held sixty pounds of metal . Carrying that sixty pounds one hundred times or more . ( whistles his admiration ) . But Holton was a drinker , went to blind pigs and bought bootleg whiskey . He started a tall man . Months pass , carrying that load , and Holton 's bent over , half my size . And he keeps getting shorter until one day he dropped one of those ladles right where we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Holton , he was left standing in it until both his feet were gone . Then he just fell over . Not like a man , but a piece of wood . I carried him out of the foundry . I laid him in the little bit of grass they got left outside the plant . He opened his eyes then . He said " What day is it ? " I said " Tuesday . " He said " Are my feet gone ? " I said " Yeah , Joe Holton . Your feet are gone . " He smelled sweet of whiskey and burning . Holton said " Look up there , Tice . Look at all that sky . " And we both looked up and I never saw it so blue in that minute , never did again . Joe said " I do believe I 'm going to heaven , Tice .

He pushes his bowl over to Corbin . Corbin looks at it hungrily ) TICE HOGAN My daughter can fill this bowl . Almost like a miracle . Does n't taste much like porridge , what Cali makes . And her soup , damn . We grow and swap vegetables with our neighbors but it must be something criminal she does with those potatoes . That fine . ( Corbin picks up the spoon ) One week , and then you leave . Do we have an agreement ? ( Corbin looks hungrily down at his bowl , then at Tice ) CORBIN TEEL One week . Yeah . We can shake on it .

Corbin is doing nothing , bored . Then Cali returns and brings in a bundle of underwear and socks to wash . She throws them down on the floor . Cali drags a bucket of water into the room , begins to wash laundry in it . Corbin studies her . ) CORBIN TEEL Outside is where my mother did the laundry . More room , keeps the floor dry . ( Cali continues with her work ) Smells nice . The soap does . Not a lot of that around . Where 'd you get it ? ( Cali continues with her work ) Have n't used that kind of soap in Should n't say . Too good to use on laundry . Behind my ears , I feel a callin ' . ( Beat ) I thank you for the soup you been feedin ' me . You made it . Lots of folks out there with nothin ' in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd speak to me . Your father . Does n't really speak to me . More like at . ( beat ) Still , those folks are outside , doin ' . I 'm stuck here , not doin ' . Rather do laundry . Though I 'm a man . ( Corbin starts to move closer ) CALI HOGAN I can handle this on my own , sir . Thank you . p. 32 CORBIN TEEL Well . CALI HOGAN It 's what my father wants . CORBIN TEEL Say that again . CALI HOGAN It 's what my father wants . CORBIN TEEL No . The other word . CALI HOGAN Which word ? CORBIN TEEL The small one . ( She does n't understand him ) CALI HOGAN Sir ? CORBIN TEEL That 's it . Say it again . CALI HOGAN Why , sir ? CORBIN TEEL I like it . Have n't heard that said . To me , anyway . In a while . From a woman . CALI HOGAN Any man in this house not my father is sir to me . CORBIN TEEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not out back ? CALI HOGAN Just keepin an eye on the house . CORBIN TEEL Oh . ( beat ) You think I 'd steal from your father ? CALI HOGAN Do n't know you . Might be a good man . CORBIN TEEL Thank you . p. 33 CALI HOGAN Might not . No offence , sir . We are n't starvin . My father 's got a little money stored up . I wash . Some there too . Keep it well hid but still . CORBIN TEEL I never stole from friends . CALI HOGAN We are not your friends . Sir . CORBIN TEEL Put a roof over my head , food in my gut , that 's friend to me . CALI HOGAN You said you 'd turn us in for putting you up to a killin ' . CORBIN TEEL I did n't kill anyone . CALI HOGAN The man you hit never got back up . CORBIN TEEL Maybe he did after I was gone . CALI HOGAN Maybe he did n't CORBIN TEEL I get the distinct feelin ' you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd take you in . Me , I 'd a taken you in , then while you slept , run a fork through your gut , dragged you out back of the railroad and dumped you . No one would miss you . Not your kind . Sir . CORBIN TEEL My kind . CALI HOGAN Lotsa men around like you . Born with little . Die with less . Sir . p. 34 CORBIN TEEL You'da murdered a man in his sleep ? CALI HOGAN Best way to do it . CORBIN TEEL You 're pulling my leg . CALI HOGAN Got a long fork . Length of my arm I use in the fire . CORBIN TEEL You 're not a killer . ( beat ) Where those socks from ? CALI HOGAN Shades Valley . Sheets from Mountain Brook Estates . ( Corbin whistles ) CORBIN TEEL Washin for the finest families in Alabama . ( beat ) You do n't know me . Should n't dislike a man you do n't know . You want me to help you . CALI HOGAN Men do n't wash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of man comin out of this decade . CALI HOGAN We 're not Reds . And there 's no such thing as a new kind of man . Please . Go sit and be quiet , sir . I want to tell him when he gets back that all you 've done all day is sit and be quiet . CORBIN TEEL You 're not with the Party ? CALI HOGAN No . CORBIN TEEL Swear to God . p. 35 CALI HOGAN I swear to God . CORBIN TEEL Reds say , in this new world , the women and the men , they 'll work side by side . As equals . They 'll kneel down over . The bucket of dreams . And that bucket 's full of . Soapy water and they 'll wash the socks there . CALI HOGAN Reds say that . CORBIN TEEL Yeah , what I hear . But folks wo n't be washin ' the socks from Shades Valley , but their own socks and their neighbours , in good yarn , no darned heels , and each person 'll have three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer . Not a bad world . If it could be like that . CALI HOGAN Hmmm . And in this new world , who will work and who will sit and gabble ? ( Making it up as he goes along ) CORBIN TEEL They say . Everyone will do a bit of both . And work will be from dawn ' til dusk , but slow and lots of water to drink in between the hours . And the old will play with the children . The young will labor . And sing . Oh . And there 's a little song Mr. Red himself wrote : Stand up from the tub , come away from the steelThey 've broken our backs , but not our hard will . ( Cali just looks at Corbin and frowns . He tries again ) Wash only the socks that the laborer wearsand the water all ' round us will clean up ourcares. p. 36 CALI HOGAN ( Not even smiling ) And what is it you yourself believe about this new world ? Sir . CORBIN TEEL ( Turns away ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're all gon na die . One way or another . No matter whose socks we wash . end scene seven p. 37 Act 1 , Scene 8 SCENE EIGHT ( Tice and Corbin together ) TICE HOGAN Where 's my book , the big one ? CORBIN TEEL I do n't know . TICE HOGAN Thing that big does n't get gone . CORBIN TEEL I ca n't help you . TICE HOGAN Had that in my family since my grandfather 's days . What else are you besides a thief ? ( Corbin shrugs ) TICE HOGAN Give it back to me . Give it back to me or else . ( Tice studies Corbin a moment ) Something funny about you today . Neck not right . Kind of turkey like . CORBIN TEEL Warm . TICE HOGAN Something else too , sitting taller . Stringy looking . CORBIN TEEL Warmer . TICE HOGAN You 're sitting on something . CORBIN TEEL Burnin ' up . TICE HOGAN You 're sitting on my damn book ! ( Corbin triumphantly removes the bible from under him and hands it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tice feels the front cover ) It 's warm . p. 38 CORBIN TEEL Only for a few minutes . TICE HOGAN Did you fart on it ? CORBIN TEEL Christ , no . TICE HOGAN Well I know you 've been having to hold it in til the night time . Dear Lord , forgive him . ( Tice wipes the bible down with his shirt . Sets it on the table again . Tice exits , returns with a plate of dried meat . He sits and begins to eat it ) CORBIN TEEL Where 'd you go last night ? To a meeting ? ( Tice ignores him ) What 'd you talk about ? ( Tice just eats , with relish ) The meetings are mixed , right ? How many are white ? Damn . How do you expect to recruit folks when you wo n't even talk to them ? I 'm stuck up in here day and night . Your daughter does n't like me . One bowl of porridge in the morning . A splash of soup at night . If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm that lean . Look , I can see the crime in making folks work for nothing . I do n't like the way things are . I might even work to make a change . But if you wo n't let me in , talk to me . Tell me how it goes . ( Tice chews on ) I give you my word . TICE HOGAN For what ? CORBIN TEEL For anything . p. 39 TICE HOGAN Why ? ( Corbin starts to speak but Tice shushes him ) Nah . Not that hogsloggin-gobbledygook you 've been talking . Try it again . Convince me. ( beat ) Why should I accept your word ? ( Corbin takes some moments to think this over . Tice helps him along ) CORBIN TEEL Because I need TICE HOGAN a new CORBIN TEEL Way TICE HOGAN Direction . CORBIN TEEL Yeah . A new direction . All my life I thought the dirt was passing under my heel as I walked , that I was TICE HOGAN Covering ground . CORBIN TEEL That I was coverin ' ground . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not me . You could change that . You could give me TICE HOGAN A map ? CORBIN TEEL Exactly . TICE HOGAN I do n't trust you . So why should I take the risk ? CORBIN TEEL Because you want to . TICE HOGAN All right . ( Corbin lets out a whoop , then shuts himself up ) p. 40 CORBIN TEEL So when 's the next meeting ? TICE HOGAN I like a challenge . Even your kind . CORBIN TEEL You do n't even know my kind . TICE HOGAN That 's where you 're wrong . Just never have them in my house . CORBIN TEEL You might learn somethin ' . TICE HOGAN Think so ? ( Beat ) Well . You like to read ? CORBIN TEEL No . I do n't TICE HOGAN Good . Then we 'll start with reading . CORBIN TEEL Do n't like reading . It stings my eyes . TICE HOGAN We 'll start with reading and we 'll keep with reading until you love it . Until your face looks like a page . CORBIN TEEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOGAN Now , choose your book . I 've got two books . This big one here , the one you degraded with your buttocks , and this little one . You can choose which one to read . CORBIN TEEL What 's the big one ? TICE HOGAN The big one is the Lord 's Holy bible . p. 41 CORBIN TEEL I 'll study this little one then . What is it ? TICE HOGAN The manifesto of the communist party . CORBIN TEEL Shit . TICE HOGAN That 's what I thought ' til I began to read it . ( He hands it to Corbin ) There 's only three copies in all Birmingham . Be careful with it . Go on . Have a look inside . ( Corbin opens the book . He studies the first page . Then closes the book ) CORBIN TEEL I 'll be straight with you . I 'm going to be a hard case . I do n't believe in it . TICE HOGAN Do n't believe in what ? CORBIN TEEL Communist thoughts . Ways . Doings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book is very simple . ( Corbin slowly pushes the book back towards Tice ) You said you wanted a map . This book is a map . ( Tice now slides his plate , with some meat still on it , in front of Corbin ) CORBIN TEEL A man should read what he wants . You like it , you read it . Let 's just talk . I prefer to talk . Use my mind . ( Tice slowly pushes the book back towards Corbin ) p. 42 TICE HOGAN But that 's just it . Living like we do , working like we do , we ca n't study our own mind cause it 's broken . This little book puts the pieces back together . ( Corbin starts to slide the book back . Tice puts out his hand and stops the book . Then he slowly slides the plate away from Corbin . Corbin studies the situation , seems to understand . He starts to slide the book back towards himself . As he does so , simultaneously the plate moves back towards him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book and plate a few moments more until Corbin gives in and let 's the plate and book lie in front of him ) . TICE HOGAN Some of us change , Corbin . Some of us pretend to change . We 've made an agreement and whatever else you are , you 'll be one or the other in my house from now on . I do n't care which . CORBIN TEEL Can I use your fork ? ( Tice holds his fork out to Corbin . Corbin reaches for it , but Tice snatches it back . Tice holds it out again , Corbin reaches for it but Tice snatches it away again . Third time Corbin snatches the fork so fast that Tice is surprised ) end scene eight p. 43 Act 1 , Scene 9 SCENE NINE ( Corbin sits at the table alone . A razor in front of him . He seems to be waiting for something , someone . Then he picks up the razor . He unfolds the blade and looks at it . He wipes it on his sleeve . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) CORBIN TEEL Yeah ? Think you 're smart ? ( He then places the knife against his own neck ) CORBIN TEEL You think you 're smart ? Idiot . You 're gon na pay . Who 's gon na pay ? You 're gon na pay . ( Cali enters carrying a bowl of water . Corbin quickly puts down the razor ) CALI HOGAN Talkin ' to yourself 's the second sign of madness , sir . CORBIN TEEL What 's the first ? I may be doubly mad . And I should know the worst if I am . ( Cali puts the bowl in front of Corbin ) CALI HOGAN First sign is a white man hidin ' out in this house . ( Corbin again takes up the razor ) CORBIN TEEL That 's it then . I guess I 'm twice mad . How ' bout you ? CALI HOGAN Water wo n't stay hot just to suit you . ( Corbin leans over the bowl and looks at his reflection ) p. 44 CORBIN TEEL I do n't know . It might . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cali takes a small mirror from her dress pocket and hands it to Corbin . ) CALI HOGAN Before you drown . ( Corbin now admires himself in the mirror , one eye on Cali . She just stands at a distance and watches him ) CORBIN TEEL Now , how do you see this face ? Honest ? Prettier than most ? CALI HOGAN Is the choice between honest but ugly or pretty but dishonest ? CORBIN TEEL I never been called pretty but a fair few girls have been attached to this face , no two ways about it . CALI HOGAN How few ? CORBIN TEEL I 've had more than my fair share . There . Scratch fair few , since you 're gon na take issue with that , and replace it with fair share . CALI HOGAN Men who boast about how they 've had their fair share most likely been puttin ' all their energy intostudyin ' themselves , if you know what I mean . ( beat ) Sir . ( Corbin begins to lather up his face ) CORBIN TEEL You could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' to talk myself up since you do n't seem to want nothin ' to do with me . Ca n't see why . I know I could do with a bath . p. 45 CALI HOGAN If you talk this much over a bowl of water I 'd hate to see what you 'd do before gettin ' in a bath . CORBIN TEEL You might not hate it . CALI HOGAN What ? CORBIN TEEL What you 'd see . Me and a bath we sort of go together . I just  --  CALI HOGAN There you go again . You ever heard of Narcissus ? CORBIN TEEL Heard it 's a quiet town . ( Cali crosses to Corbin and takes the mirror from him just as he 's about to start shaving . She leans over his shoulder and holds it in front of his face ) CALI HOGAN He 's from an old Greek myth . He was in love with himself . CORBIN TEEL Got ta start lovin ' somewhere . Practice makes perfect . I practice on myself regularly . ( Cali now briefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of her closeness . She takes the razor and it appears as if she will shave him . After a moment she moves away ) CORBIN TEEL And what happened to old Narcissus ? ( Cali now begins to circle the table ) CALI HOGAN Narcissus . He lost his face . A goddess , angered by his vanity , swooped down and stole his face as punishment . He wandered for eternity , lookin ' for himself . p. 46 CORBIN TEEL How 's he gon na do that ? He has n't got any eyes . CALI HOGAN Exactly . CORBIN TEEL Damn . That 's hard . CALI HOGAN And I have your face here , in this mirror . I might break it . CORBIN TEEL Seven years bad luck for you . CALI HOGAN And no face . Forever . For you , sir . ( Corbin rises , his face still lathered up . He begins to slowly follow Cali ) CORBIN TEEL And what if Narciss-whatever , accidentally bumped into this goddess ? CALI HOGAN Chances are against it . CORBIN TEEL Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CORBIN TEEL This is a small room . CALI HOGAN Eternity does n't have a size . CORBIN TEEL And time is passing while the water 's gettin ' cold . ( Corbin corners Cali but does not try to touch her ) CALI HOGAN My , Sir , how your beard 's grown . ( Corbin takes some lather from his face with a finger and then very slowly puts it on Cali 's face . Then Cali gives him back the mirror and the razor. ) p. 47 CALI HOGAN I do n't want your face . You keep it . ( Cali wipes the fleck of lather from her skin ) end scene nine p. 48 Act 1 , Scene 10 SCENE TEN ( Tice is teaching Corbin how to soap box ) TICE HOGAN Sometimes all you have is a snap of time . Just that quick to step up and say what you 've got to say . Just a snap . The police come , you 've got to blend backinto the streets . Like you 're nothing . When Harry Haywood came to Birmingham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your head up in the air or these crackers 'll spot you . You 've got to get that slouch in your walk . Look scared , as if you are about to run . Now , first the snap , step out and loud : ( Jumps up on a chair and makes a strange , shocking cry ) Jesus Christ , Lord forgive me . Do n't look ! Do n't look ! That 'll get their attention . Moment they turn towards you , you plow on in . You 've got to know the mind only seems like a stone : hard , tight , solid . But really it 's a bowl of water and you can throw anything in it . Some of it will sink but sometimes some of it will float and when the day comes and they commence to drowning they 'll grab hold of that flotsam and use it . CORBIN TEEL Do n't see myself in public speaking . TICE HOGAN Damn it . You 've been at me for hours to show you how it 's done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your best box man . p. 49 TICE HOGAN The best box man , that 'd be me . Now listen and learn . CORBIN TEEL I ca n't speak to crowds . They scare me . TICE HOGAN Hey . You hear me : no other organization will have you . CORBIN TEEL So . Might change my mind . Could go back to Muscatine and CORBIN/TICE Cut buttons . TICE HOGAN No . Buttons are done . Out of fashion . It 's the zip , tie or clip these days . CORBIN TEEL Could join the Klan TICE HOGAN They wo n't have you . You 're too poor . In Birmingham , Klan 's a middle class organization . They wear that fine linen over their heads . Though they might let you wash their sheets . CORBIN TEEL Could join the NAACP . More respectable than your party . TICE HOGAN They wo n't have you either . NAACP are nice people . Nice people are n't poor people . Besides , they 've only got one , two , three , four , five , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got four hundred and ninety three . Want me to count that out so you 'll see the difference ? CORBIN TEEL The party down here , it 's just a puppet for the Reds in New York . That 's what they say . And the Russians . You jump when the Russians call . Jump . Jump . p. 50 TICE HOGAN Jump . Well , I guess we do sometimes . Just like the NAACP jumps when their directives are handed down . Just like any local jumps . But the New York cadre are n't here . Neither is Joe Stalin . Our work is local . Ideas are too . CORBIN TEEL Why do you want me in the party anyway ? TICE HOGAN Because you 're crippled up a bit and that attracts sympathy . Poor , that makes you like us . Not too ugly . That attracts trust . No family so if the police kill you , no hearts to break . ( Corbin is not impressed ) TICE HOGAN Facts are , we 're a bit low on white boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we 're a party of black and white . And black and white CORBIN/TICE must unite . CORBIN TEEL Why in the hell ? TICE HOGAN Because Jesus Christ says the poor , that 's us , are all brothers . And his right hand man , a quick little fellow , boils on his ass , goes by the name of Karl , says those who labor , that 's us again , even if we are out of work , to make the wealth are one . CORBIN TEEL Even when we 're at eachother 's throats ? TICE HOGAN That 's where the bosses want us to be , face to face , rather than  --  p. 51 CORBIN TEEL ( Bored ) side by side . TICE HOGAN That 's right . Now shut up and do what I do . ( Tice lets out a call again . Corbin gives a weak imitation ) What 've you got stuck in your throat ? Open up that hole , like this . ( Tice makes the call again . Corbin imitates him , a little better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chair ) I think what you 're missing is that feeling of being choked by the world . You wake up with it in the morning like a hand round your throat . All day long it 's squeezing . Your call , it 's got to break that grip . Now . Let 's try this ( Tice puts his hands around Corbin 's throat . The two men eye one another . For a moment , there is a sense of danger ) Now break my hold . No . With your voice . ( Corbin tries some feeble choked calls . Tice grips him tighter . Suddenly Corbin lets out a choke-freeing yodel that breaks Tice 's grip ) . You try that in the outhouse and I promise you everything just leap right out of there . Now , when you 've got their attention , main thing is , do n't ever repeat yourself . You 've got to throw them something different every time , making it up as you go : ( Now Tice gets on the table to soap box ) My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers swinging belts at your back , while you work for a spoonful of nothing and a cupful of less ? You may be jobless , but that 's no fair relief . Think of your gruelling , daily struggle in terms ofapples . We , my brethren , we are the appleson the tree . TCI and work relief want us to shrink up so small we forget we 're apples and think we 're just the shrivelled sum of our seeds . But wait , you say , Seeds are for planting , rebirth and hope ! ( Chants ) Let 's be seeds ! We are seeds ! p. 52 TICE/CORBIN ( Chant ) Seeds , Seeds , We are seeds.But hold on ! Wait a minute . Seeds are nothing without the hard flesh of the apple to keep them warm , to protect them from the icy winds til they 're ready to burst forth and make a new apple tree . Brothers and Sisters , we are more than the sum of our seeds . We 're the apple , the branch and the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into our parts . We will be whole or nothing . Therefore , we jobless apples got to demand a minimum work relief of ten dollars a week , paid in cash , not scrip , and free car fare , free coal . So we 're going down to city hall at dusk and we 're going down together , as a bushel , to get what we need . CORBIN TEEL You 'll never get ten dollars . TICE HOGAN ( turns on him , playing the part ) Ah , the white slave speaks . Just how much are you getting paid now , young man ? CORBIN TEEL I 'm not . TICE HOGAN Work relief ? CORBIN TEEL Red Cross would n't take any more of us on . TICE HOGAN But are you not a man ? Do you not need to eat ? CORBIN TEEL I need to eat , yeah . I am a man . p. 53 TICE HOGAN Then you are one of us . Come and walk and shout with us . We can get ten dollars . We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the back too . TICE HOGAN We get thousands on the street , we 'll make those bullets turn tail , shoot right back up their barrels . CORBIN TEEL You sound like a Commie . Dirty red , you are ! Want to mix the races . Give these stupid people big ideas until their heads go pop . You want to make us believe that we 're equal , me and you . TICE HOGAN Nah . I 'm not here to teach you to see me as equal , to behold my humanity . You 're here to learn why you 're so small , soul all squashed up in the back of your neck , your eyes , your big blue eyes , like two assholes holding their breath . Look at yourself . You 're nothing but a pit sucking , coal shittin CORBIN TEEL Crippled up TICE HOGAN road trash piece of bukra CORBIN TEEL peckerwood TICE HOGAN pork-skinned CORBIN TEEL son of a pig 's bitch about to be slaughtered with a fork because the knife 's too good for me . TICE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TEEL I 'll be there . TICE HOGAN What did I tell you ? It works . end scene ten p. 54 Act 1 , Scene 11 SCENE ELEVEN ( Corbin is alone with the little book . But the little book is on the floor . He is looking at it . He gives it a hesitant , small kick , but quickly looks around to make sure he is still alone and no one has seen this . Then he gets up on a chair and stands looking down at the book . He glances around once more to check that it 's clear , then jumps off the chair and lands with both feet on the book . He remains standing on the book . Then he slowly lifts one foot and peaks at the book to see what damage he 's done . He 's almost afraid to look . He lifts the other foot . The book is still intact . He now speaks to the book ) . CORBIN TEEL What ? Think you 're a man ? Think you 're something else , huh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your back . Should I do it again ? ( He threatens to climb back on the chair , but does n't . Instead , he sits down on the floor next to the book , as though it were a person . He glances at it a few times ) Yeah , you can talk and string a few words together but you know what , little book , **84;2746;TOOLONG book , you know what you ca n't do ? ( Corbin begins to whistle . He whistles a little tune ) Ha . And what 's more , he thinks when we 're alone together , you 're all snuggled up in my face . And I tell him we are . And you do n't say nothing . You are . Yeah , complicit in the lie . Thought I did n't know any big words , huh ? Yeah , you little complicit bastard , **31;2832;TOOLONG book . Ca n't use a pickax , can you ? Ca n't dig a hole . ( Beat ) Or kiss a woman ( Suddenly Tice appears from outside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stunned . Tice slowly crosses the room . He sits . He closes his eyes . Corbin just stares at him. ) p. 55 TICE HOGAN What the hell is my book doing on the floor ? ( Corbin snatches up the book , dusts it off and hesitantly offers it to Tice , who starts to take it but then pulls his hand back ) No . Blood . CORBIN TEEL What happened  --  TICE HOGAN ( interrupts , quietly ) Read to me . CORBIN TEEL Why do n't I  --  TICE HOGAN ( Harsh ) Damn you , I said read to me . ( Corbin is unsettled by this and opens the book at random ) CORBIN TEEL " Differences ofage and sex have no longer any distinctive social validity for the working class . All are instruments of labour , more or less expensive to use , according to their age and sex " TICE HOGAN When I rewrite that book , it 'll say " more or less expensive to use , according to their age and sex and race . " ' Cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party , colored women and men , our focus is on our lives and works . Not yours , not yours Corbin . But you can come along .

" TICE HOGAN ( Finishing it for him , though in pain ) . " According to this , bourgeois society ought long ago to have gone to the dogs through sheer idleness ; CORBIN TEEL For those of its members who work , acquire nothing , and those who acquire anything TICE/CORBIN do not work . " TICE HOGAN No . No . I read those pieces to you yesterday . You read me something else . ( Corbin does n't move , then he puts the book down ) CORBIN TEEL I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TEEL What happened to you ? TICE HOGAN I said why ? CORBIN TEEL I 'll get some water . TICE HOGAN Read the damn book . CORBIN TEEL No . TICE HOGAN Say it , Corbin . Say it now or I 'll start screamin out the door I 've got a murderer in my house and they 'll come and finish us both off . p. 57 CORBIN TEEL You do n't know if that foreman died . TICE HOGAN I know . CORBIN TEEL I did n't mean to kill him . TICE HOGAN How stupid do you think I am ? That I did n't know the moment I laid eyes on you , heard your talk , listened to that tick , tick , tick ? You 're no surprise to me . CORBIN TEEL You 're saying I 'm a cold blooded killer ? That what you 're saying ? TICE HOGAN No , god damn it . I 'm saying you ca n't read , ( beat ) Knew it the first time you opened the book . Asking me to read it first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line . And then you 'd memorise . And I 'll be damned if you did n't memorise ' bout half that book . You 're good . Oh , you 're good . What 're you after ? Most men like you , they ca n't read . Are n't ashamed of it , neither . Why 're you so good at pretending you 're just a little like me ? CORBIN TEEL There 's blood in your mouth . TICE HOGAN I said what are you after , Corbin Teel ? ( Blood has trickled down Tice 's chin . He just stares at Corbin . Corbin comes closer to him , hesitantly . Even more hesitantly , he uses his fingers to wipe the blood gently from Tice 's chin ) p. 58 CORBIN TEEL Let me have a look . ( Tice reluctantly let 's Corbin open his shirt . Corbin touches Tice 's ribs and Tice stifles his pain ) Maybe some ribs cracked . TICE HOGAN Where 's Cali ? ( Corbin removes his own shirt ) CORBIN TEEL Deliverin ' sheets . " Going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have to wrap you up . Tight . So those ribs can heal . ( Corbin tears his shirt into a couple of strips to bind Tice ) Not as bad as it looks . Mostly just blood . TICE HOGAN I could teach you to read . But you 've got to ask . CORBIN TEEL Nah . Too late . TICE HOGAN Half the party ca n't read . They pair us up . One 's that can read 've got to teach the ones that ca n't . And when they begin to read , they begin to figure . Figure out that this broken piece of Alabama fits into something larger , that what we 're pushing here might just shift something somewhere else . CORBIN TEEL Tell me what happened . You get in a fight at the pool hall ? You mangy old rascal you . ( Tice is silent . Then he starts to laugh , even though it hurts him . Corbin laughs too ) p. 59 TICE HOGAN Fifth time we 'd moved the meeting since June . Do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a postcard campaign to the mayor for cash wages , protection from eviction .

A man on each hand while a third one started to count . One , two , three , four . He broke the fingers on each hand . Of your man , Clyde Johnson , the one you never met . I heard the bones pop . Little sounds . Like walking in the woods and stepping on sticks . Would hardly notice the sound but for Clyde screaming . I was in the corner , thinking what a lucky bastard he was . Just his fingers . Not that they wo n't kill a white man . Tenant farmer J.W. Davis lynched for working with the Sharecroppers Union . But more likely it 's just fingers . Ralph Grey . They did n't break his fingers . He was a colored man so they shot him instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Back , chest . Dumped his body on the steps of the courthouse . In a crowd there , kicking and shooting his body , though he was long dead . CORBIN TEEL Problem with the Klan , you ca n't see their faces . TICE HOGAN Was n't the Klan . It was the Police , TCI guards , and any white man on the street who wanted to take part . Men of good standing . Men who wear the buttons you made in Muscatine . Men who go home to good pies and meats for dinner , touch their women late in the night . ( beat ) Then they went through the streets . Word is dozens wounded and dead . p. 60 CORBIN TEEL You 're safe now . TICE HOGAN You are too . All this mess and they 've forgotten about your foreman . CORBIN TEEL Maybe . TICE HOGAN If you really did kill a foreman . If you name is Corbin Teel . ( Corbin is still wrapping Tice 's torso ) CORBIN TEEL You 're gon na be pretty sore tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cools down . I want you to get out . CORBIN TEEL Ca n't leave now . TICE HOGAN Not my daughter . CORBIN TEEL Have n't touched her . TICE HOGAN Never will . ( As Corbin speaks , he tightens the strips around Tice and makes him gasp . As the scene progresses , it 's as though Corbin has taken over physically ) CORBIN TEEL I like your daughter . I like you . I 'll go by your rules . But both of us know that all I got to do is open that door and then what you got over me in here , Mr. Hogan , is the same as nothing out there . So I 'll stay here long as I want . My one question is , why did n't those men kill you if they had you ? p. 61 TICE HOGAN ' Cause I know how to run . CORBIN TEEL With broken ribs . TICE HOGAN That just makes me faster . CORBIN TEEL It 'll take that a while to heal . Meanwhile . ( Corbin roughly jerks Tice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . Then Corbin slaps the book in front of Tice . Tice does n't respond . Corbin opens it to the first page for him ) You teach me . Your daughter can read , and if I 'm going to impress your daughter , I 've got to learn it myself . TICE HOGAN Impress her all you like . You touch her and I 'll TICE/CORBIN Kill you . CORBIN TEEL What ? Beat me to death with one of your broken ribs ? TICE HOGAN If I have to . CORBIN TEEL Well , we 've all got to die some way . TICE HOGAN Bastard . CORBIN TEEL How could we look at this in terms of apples ? TICE HOGAN I 'm gon na crush you up into cider with my own bare hands . CORBIN TEEL I wo n't harm your daughter . p. 62 TICE HOGAN And suck up the juice . CORBIN TEEL You have my word . TICE HOGAN Yeah , I have your word and you ca n't even read it . CORBIN TEEL So teach me . ( Adjusts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trapped . Tice does not respond ) CORBIN TEEL One word at a time . Then I 'll read it back to you . ( beat ) Read the god damn book . ( Tice does n't look down at the book but instead says the words from memory , looking elsewhere . Corbin sits beside him , close , and looks at the page ) TICE HOGAN First thing I did to learn myself is I counted out the letters . Then the words . Something about knowing what it was all made up of , helped me  --  CORBIN TEEL ( Interrupts ) Just show me . TICE HOGAN A. CORBIN TEEL A. TICE HOGAN Spectre . CORBIN TEEL Spectre . TICE HOGAN is . CORBIN TEEL is. p. 63 TICE HOGAN haunting . CORBIN TEEL haunting . Okay . Now say the letters for me. ( beat ) Say the letters . ( Tice is silent some moments ) TICE HOGAN U. CORBIN TEEL U. TICE HOGAN R. CORBIN TEEL R. TICE HOGAN A. CORBIN TEEL A. TICE HOGAN Son-of-a-bitch . ( Corbin just looks at Tice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) CORBIN TEEL Turn the page . Let 's read a different page . Always something better on the other side , right ? TICE HOGAN Party ca n't use a man like you . You 've got no- CORBIN TEEL What . TICE HOGAN Foundation . ( beat ) That 's F. O. U. N. CORBIN TEEL Turn the page . You will teach me to read . And that way I 'll know everything that you know . ( Tice suddenly looks at him , then looks at the book in front of them . Tice moves his hand to touch the page . Suddenly Corbin smacks his hand away ) . p. 64 CORBIN TEEL Hey . You 've got blood on your hands . I 'll do it . ( Corbin carefully turns the page . After some moments Tice looks at the page with Corbin ) @x ( Tice appears sharpening a small piece of steel , a home-made blade . The stone against the steel makes an eerie sound that echoes from another world . As Tice speaks , he 'll sharpen the blade in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ binding , with a strip of leather , the blade to a home-made wood handle . He is wearing the same clothes as in Act One , but a different shirt ) TICE HOGAN Criminal violence is overrated in America . ( scrapes the knife with the stone ) Hell , we know what it does . Makes lots of noise , most of the time . Glass , wood , bone . Brick , plaster , gravel . Tires on fire as they spin amphetamines . Guns , coins and rattle . And death , some of that too , which is a ( scrapes the knife ) bullet in the wall . A bullet in a sack of flour . A bullet in a piece of fruit . ( Scrapes the knife ) And this takes me back to apples . Over the years , it started to rub on me , how I used the apple . The fruits of labor , the apple tree family . Etceteras . But then I got to thinkin ' ' bout the apple and yeah , its flesh is white , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hmmm . Follow it a little further and the good part , the sweet part is the white flesh . Who cares about those little seeds ? You eat one by mistake , you just ( does three quick spits ) p. 66 . Not a second thought . So I quit on the apples . Gave them a rest for a while . But then it crept up on me again , because the seeds are , naturally , at the core ; the seed is the core . You swallow one , it shoots right back out , ready to make a tree wherever it lands . ( Says the following in one , smooth breath : ) And then it came to me a little further that maybe an apple is just an apple for a horse not a man and better left out of conversation all together . ( Begins to bind the knife to the wooden handle with the leather strip ) Things fall apart , yeah . They do . With time . But for a reason . And a rhyme . There 's another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This one is the one we knew . ( beat ) And so there came a-sweeping , over these bony , penniless comrades in Birmingham , Alabama a wave of repression inconceivable in a democratic country . In-con-ceivable . We , the down and dirty reds , who were mostly black , but for a few whites , some of which were Klansmen gone red , we pushed for jobs , for work relief , to free the Scottsboro boys . Inconceivable in a democratic country . Not what we worked for , but the state forces that worked against us : beatings , torture , death . Takes only . Shit . Twenty letters to spell that out : B.E.A.T.I.N.G.S. , T.O.R.T.U.R.E. , D.E.A.T.H . And you read it right there on the page and it does n't make a sound . Not a god damn sound . ( The knife is complete now ) p. 67 You ever had a knife at your throat ? That too , is overrated . A knife at my throat I can see does n't bother me the way the ones I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have got the ones we ca n't see circling ' round our neck and all your life you 've got to watch which way you turn your head or you 'll get . Stuck . ( Tice holds out the knife ) Here , how sharp it is ? Feel it . See how it shines ? ( Now he withdraws the real knife and slowly holds out his other hand with the invisible knife in it ) And this one , the one you ca n't see , feel that blade . Go on . Touch it . Just touch it . ( beat ) There 's nothing like it . ( Suddenly Tice throws the invisible knife high up into the air above him . He does some wild dodges and then catches the invisible knife in the air , perfectly ) Damn I like that one . One of my favourites : the invisible knife . ' Course it only goes so many miles cause then you 're back to the stuff you can see : in my time , in thirty five years , ' bout three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see them hanging.And it would have taken more than an invisible knife to cut them down . ( Then Tice seats himself at the table , and with his knife he flips the pages of the small book , to the page he 's looking for ) @x ( In the dark , Cali is asleep on the floor among the largest pile of sheets we have yet seen . These sheets seem to glow in the darkness with a strange , ethereal light . Magically , a sheet rises from its pile and floats in the air above Cali . If possible , more than one sheet rises up , perhaps many . The sheets float around the stage like ghosts . Cali sits up in her " dream , " and marvels at the floating sheets . She reaches to grab one , but it evades her . She tries again . ) CALI HOGAN Come back here , you . ( Cali follows the sheet/sheets around the room , mesmerized by it , jumping for it , laughing as it evades her , enjoying the strange game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come back down . Damn . Way up there . Give me a ride . Wo n't you give me a ride ? ( Finally Cali gives up and sits back down on the pile of sheets . When she does so , the sheet , or sheets , floats down into her arms , and she " wakes " and begins to sing ) CALI HOGAN Church offers me a sermon sweetbar begs me to move my feetmeetin ' discusses how we all gon na eatbut only place I 'm gon na beis both ends of a whiteman 's sheetboth ends of a whiteman 's sheetShee-eet , Shee-eet , Shee-eet . ( Corbin enters the room , with a bowl of porridge . He repeats the last line of her song ) p. 69 CORBIN TEEL ( Sings ) Both ends of a whiteman 's sheet . CALI HOGAN ( coldly ) What do you think would happen in Shades Valley and Mountain Brooks if their sheets never came back to their house ? CORBIN TEEL Guess they 'd sleep in their towels . CALI HOGAN I 'm washing those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in their curtains . CALI HOGAN They 're out back with the shirts . CORBIN TEEL I 'll be leaving after the weekend . CALI HOGAN More soup for us . ( Cali gets up and begins to sort the sheets ) CORBIN TEEL You know , there 's other things you can do with sheets besides fold them . ( He takes the other end of the sheet and wraps Cali in it ) You can wear it like a Greek Goddess . CALI HOGAN Nah . Too tight . And those Goddesses were always fightin ' over babies and fruit . Not my style . Eat your porridge or it 'll get cold . ( Corbin twirls her from the sheet ) CORBIN TEEL You could make a tent . ( Corbin gets under the sheet and spreads his arms to make a kind of tent ) Hey , pretty Lady , would you like to come in and see my tent ? ( He dances around her as a tent , but she shakes her head no. ) p. 70 CALI HOGAN Besides , looks like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drops his arms and speaks as a ghost under the sheets ) CORBIN TEEL I 'm not the Klan . I 'm a good citizen . CALI HOGAN There 's a difference ? ( Corbin pulls the sheet off and stares at Cali ) CORBIN TEEL Tell me what I need to do to get close to you . CALI HOGAN Keep your distance . That way you 'll get close enough . Meanwhile , why do n't you take hold of some of these and help me fold ' em . ( Cali piles some sheets in his arms . She begins to fold them ) CORBIN TEEL Look . I understand why its a Difficult thing for you and me . CALI HOGAN Hold the corners so I can pull ' em tight . CORBIN TEEL Another man . He 'd take what he wanted . No one to stop him . ( Cali stops folding for a moment ) But I 'm not like other . Men . I am . Decent . Yeah , a decent man . ( Cali does n't respond ) Tell me what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't move . p. 71 CORBIN TEEL That 's all ? Hey . What are you doing ? ( Now Cali is wrapping Corbin in a sheet . She does this easily and expertly so that before he knows what is happening , he 's wearing the sheet ) I ca n't move my arms . ( Corbin is wrapped in the sheet , which looks like a makeshift dress ) Cali , girl . What is your game ? CALI HOGAN Ask me how you look . CORBIN TEEL How do I look ? CALI HOGAN You look like a girl . CORBIN TEEL Am I pretty ? CALI HOGAN No . But I can take care of that . CORBIN TEEL Go on then . ( Cali takes shoe polish from her dress . She puts it on Corbin 's face ) Hey ! CALI HOGAN Quiet , Corbin Teel . You want me to play with you , you do it my way . ( She continues applying the shoe polish as he speaks ) CORBIN TEEL Well , I admit I kinda had something else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this CALI HOGAN Shhh ! ( Corbin relents and she finishes his face , which is now black with shoe polish . Cali fluffs his hair , stands back to look ) p. 72 CORBIN TEEL Now you gon na kiss this girl or what ? ( Cali turns away ) Hey . I did n't let you dress me up for nothing . Come here . Kiss me . ( Corbin comes after her , still wrapped in his sheet and walking awkward . He stumbles ) Shit . CALI HOGAN Wait . Stay there . I 'm not done . ( From the table , Cali picks up and handful of porridge . She smears it onto her face until she 's wearing a white mask of porridge . Corbin watches her , unsure ) There . How 's that . How do I look ? CORBIN TEEL I do n't think I 'm liking this game . CALI HOGAN What 's the matter , little girl does n't want to play ? Little girl wants a kiss , does she ? ( Cali makes kissing noises as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh . Little girl wants more than a kiss ? ( Cali circles him , talking sweetly ) Problem with you , little girl . Little . Savage . Girl . You want it all . ( Cali suddenly shoves Corbin back against the wall . She puts her arm across his throat and pins him there , so he can not speak . As she speaks , now with menace , she increases the pressure on his throat so he begins to struggle ) I see the lust in your eyes , bitch . I smell the sex on your breath . You 're just waiting for me to take it , are n't you ? ( Cali puts her hand between his legs . She tuts her disapproval ) You ought to be ashamed . Wet as you are . I could turn you inside out . ( Corbin breaks free of her hold , and with the force of his body , shoves her backwards . Cali stumbles and falls . Corbin violently frees himself from his sheets and stands over her . He unbuckles his belt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cali strikes him in the face . He freezes ) p. 73 CALI HOGAN Corbin Teel . Now I see you . All these days I was n't sure but now I see you clear : a decent man . ( Corbin stares at Cali on the floor below him . Then he steps away from her ) CORBIN TEEL Damn you . ( Corbin wipes his face on one of the sheets ) Damn you . I 'm sorry . ( After some moments , Cali takes the sheet from him ) CALI HOGAN Do n't you ruin my sheets . Sit down . ( Corbin sits . Cali spits on the edge of her apron and cleans his face with it ) CORBIN TEEL I take it you do n't like me . CALI HOGAN There are parts of me you ca n't know . No matter I lay down with you or not . CORBIN TEEL Then I 'll love the parts I come to know . And hardest the parts I ca n't . CALI HOGAN My , my . How you can honey the talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You want something ? Here . You can have this . ( Cali scrapes some porridge from her face . She roughly smears it across his mouth ) But I tell you one thing , Mr. Teel . You will not dream on my body . ( Cali leaves the room . Corbin looks after her . After some moments , he wipes his mouth ) end scene one p. 74 Act 2 , Scene 2 SCENE TWO ( Tice , Cali and Corbin have finished dinner . Tice is reading to them at the table . Corbin picks at the calluses on his hands with his razor ) TICE HOGAN " But not only has the bourgeoisie "  --  ( Corbin makes a long , strange , irritating noise . Tice stops . Then starts again , patiently ) " But not only has the bourgeoisie "  --  ( Corbin again makes a long noise . Cali stifles a giggle ) In my house , Mr. Teel , you will listen to me read . Or no more soup . CORBIN TEEL In your house , I can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a moment , then continues ) TICE HOGAN " But not only has the bourgeoisie forged the weapons that bring death to itself ; it has also called into existence the men who are to wield those weapons  --  " CORBIN TEEL Are we done for tonight ? Seems like we 're just turnin ' somersaults here . Why wo n't you quit this readin ' and take me to a meeting with you ? Let me meet the rest of the men . TICE HOGAN But some men do not fight for their brethren . CORBIN TEEL I could follow you one night , you know . I could follow you and turn you in . I could bring the roof down . ( Tice finds another section and reads ) p. 75 TICE HOGAN But some men , they become " an appendage of the machine . " ( Tice stares at Corbin ) CORBIN TEEL Do n't look at me . Shit . I 'm not the one sounding like some machine . Tell me something . This Karl the-plug-ugly - beard- man - Marx . He wrote that bitty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOGAN Jewish . CORBIN TEEL Skin 's white . Just like me . And he 's dead . And you 've got his words all stuffed up in your mouth . Live by ' em . It do n't figure . TICE HOGAN I do n't live by them . I use them . CORBIN TEEL You eat his words . TICE HOGAN Yeah . And I mix them with Du Bois , the Bible . Lots of things . All good words of justice they come from . Some kind of heaven . Maybe that 's right . But what 's driving those words comes from the motor right here under our feet , what we learned fighting a slave-owning culture with something you could never imagine : spectacular resistance and spirit- CORBIN TEEL ( interrupts ) Nah , nah , nah . All you seem to know how to do is talk , Tice . Tice-the-talker . Yeah . It 's a pretty way to move in the world but some of us , our bodies get in the way and we ca n't find the talk for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cuts his own arm . It bleeds . Cali is disturbed . ) I think a man 's natural state is to bleed , not to talk . What do you think , Cali ? ( Cali just watches him ) p. 76 TICE HOGAN You 've got it backwards . We talk so we do n't have to bleed . I think I 'll have another potato . Pass the salt , comrade . ( Corbin slaps his hand away ) . CORBIN TEEL Hey . CALI HOGAN Oh , today he 's a comrade . Yesterday he was an S.O.B . TICE HOGAN Do you mock me in front of guests ? CALI HOGAN Now he 's also a guest . CORBIN TEEL Actually I 'm a po-ten-tial member of the Party . The key word here being TICE/CORBIN Potential . CORBIN TEEL And there 's no end of potential in this room . Cali , let me help you with the dishes . TICE HOGAN You will not help her with the dishes . Your po-ten-tial shrivels with your even thinking about it . Now pass the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor ) CORBIN TEEL Get your own salt . Shit . Spilled salt . Means the devil 's gon na get your ass , Tice . Can the party protect you from the devil ? ( Tice gets up slowly and retrieves the salt . He sits back down ) . TICE HOGAN We 're in session over that right now . But that 's my problem . You 're problem is you are not , after all , what you think you are . p. 77 CALI HOGAN Get on your marks . CORBIN TEEL And what does that mean ? CALI HOGAN Get set . TICE HOGAN Let me explain . CORBIN TEEL You better do that . CALI HOGAN Go . TICE HOGAN But you 'll have to close your eyes . You have to listen , not look . It 's your lookin ' that 's got you where you are now . It 's your seein that 's twisted your mind . Twisted your soul into believin ' that the pursuit of property , which is kin to the pursuit and consolidation of whiteness  --  CALI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  really might be the pursuit of happiness . ( beat ) Got it ? ( Corbin opens his eyes ) CORBIN TEEL This 's got somethin ' to do with salt ? ( Cali giggles . Tice slams the table in frustration ) TICE HOGAN ( To Cali ) Damn it , you wo n't learn from me so let him do it . CALI HOGAN I just do n't like to see you waste your time , Daddy . p. 78 CORBIN TEEL Now wait just a darn minute  --  TICE HOGAN ( to Corbin ) But Cali 's right . Until you 've proven otherwise , you 're neither a comrade nor a guest . Nor are you CORBIN TEEL What ? An idiot ? ( to Cali ) Now you heard it from your father first : Cali , I am not an idiot . TICE HOGAN No . You 're not an idiot , but neither are you a white man . CORBIN TEEL Huh ? TICE HOGAN Your heard me . CORBIN TEEL No . Do n't think I did . Say it again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CALI HOGAN He said . TICE HOGAN Do n't you speak for me . CALI HOGAN He said . TICE HOGAN I said You . Are . Not . A. White . Man . There . Do n't make me say it again . CALI HOGAN Damn . TICE HOGAN It 's a hard truth . Hard and ugly and I do n't like saying it but some things have got to be said . p. 79 CALI HOGAN And all this time I thought . TICE HOGAN What ? CALI HOGAN I was sure he was- TICE HOGAN ( to Corbin ) There have always been black and white , right ? But that 's a lie . There were slaves in Greece and Rome , long ago , but they knew nothing about race . CALI HOGAN Imagine . A better world . Too bad it 's behind us . TICE HOGAN They made their divisions between civilised and barbarians . And you could have a white skin and be a slave . CALI HOGAN Sounds like my kind of heaven . TICE HOGAN A black skin and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to die right here at this table  --  TICE HOGAN Oppression was justified in terms of culture , not race . CALI HOGAN  --  and be born again a Roman . TICE HOGAN ( To Cali ) Cali . I may not inspire in you a feeling for books , but please shut up and let him learn . CALI HOGAN Alright . I 'll go and wash your socks , Father . p. 80 TICE HOGAN Good . ( to Corbin ) You became a white man only ' cause I was said to be colored . CALI HOGAN I can smell them stinkin ' from the other room . ( But she does n't move ) CORBIN TEEL Then if I 'm not white , you 're not colored . TICE HOGAN Not until the slave trade gave me that definition . CALI HOGAN Finished all the sheets from that big white house . TICE HOGAN What I 'm saying is white is not how you 're born , it 's what you 're paid . CALI HOGAN Now I can start on your laundry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privileges that come with acting white . CORBIN TEEL I do n't . Act white . I 'm just . Me . TICE HOGAN No . No . You are a white me . A white Corbin Teel . And you have a ticket in your pocket which is now sewn to your ass . And that ticket says you get privileges . If not money , then laws that 'll decide in your favour . CORBIN TEEL You got a ticket ? TICE HOGAN Well . Well then . Yes , I have . p. 81 CALI HOGAN Let me guess . Your ticket , unlike Corbin 's , says you 're getting on the train at the back of the station . No roof , no seats to sit on . Hold on to a piece of string tied to your neighbour 's waist when you go round a corner . Headed to the next back of the station . No peanuts served . When the tracks break down , lay down in front of the train and help it pass over . TICE HOGAN Exactly . ( Cali @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corbin 's face . Corbin and Tice are stunned ) CALI HOGAN How dare you come into this house masquerading as a white man . Give me that damn ticket , I 'm gon na tear it to pieces . TICE HOGAN Wo n't make no odds . He 'll just run on back to Daddy and get him another one . CORBIN TEEL Hey , listen up . The both of you : I 've got no ticket . I 've got nothin ' but the shirt on my back . That enough to make me white ? TICE HOGAN A shirt is property . CORBIN TEEL But this is your god damn shirt ! TICE HOGAN That 's not the point . CORBIN TEEL You lent it to me after I cut mine to shreds to bind your busted ribs . p. 82 TICE HOGAN Nevertheless , if you take it and sell it you 'll get a better price for it than I could because CORBIN TEEL of my ticket . Bullshit . It 's just a shirt . CALI HOGAN Actually , it 's my shirt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small for him . ( Corbin smells the shirt ) CORBIN TEEL ( To Cali ) I 'm wearing your shirt ? CALI HOGAN It 's yours now . TICE HOGAN And property is privilege . CALI HOGAN You 're right , Daddy . Every little bit counts . CORBIN TEEL So this is all about having clothes ? TICE HOGAN No . It 's a way of seeing things . CORBIN TEEL Well . Then I guess there 's only one way to find out . I 'll take off my clothes . Right here where I stand . And then we 'll see what we 've got . TICE HOGAN ( Laughs ) I do n't think my daughter would take too kindly to that in her house . CALI HOGAN Father , let him do what he dares . ( Cali and her father look at one another . Corbin looks back and forth at both of them , not sure if it 's a game ) p. 83 CORBIN TEEL ( Challenging ) All right . Shit . Yeah . Okay . ( Corbin takes off his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methodically takes off his socks and hands them to Cali . Then , he dramatically takes off his shirt He is now undressing for Cali . He gives her his shirt ) How 'm I doin ' ? CALI HOGAN Some of that shine is comin ' off yourface . CORBIN TEEL You like it ? ( Cali gives him a first real smile . Corbin laughs in triumph , standing only in his long pants , and makes to take the clothes back from Cali to get dressed ) TICE HOGAN Finish what you started , Corbin Teel . Go on . CALI HOGAN Daddy . TICE HOGAN A man that does n't finish what he 's started is only half a man . Cali does n't like things by half . Neither do I. And neither does the communist party . ( Corbin considers this , then begins to unbutton his pants . Cali turns away ) CALI HOGAN Do n't . You 've gone far enough . ( Corbin stops . He looks at Tice ) TICE HOGAN Go on . p. 84 CORBIN TEEL What kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game . A test . CORBIN TEEL What for ? TICE HOGAN Just want to see how far you 'll go to make yourself a new man . ( After a moment , Corbin takes off his pants ) TICE HOGAN Finish up . ( Corbin hesitates , then takes off his underpants . He throws them , hard , at Tice , who catches them . Corbin just stand there , naked ) . Well , well . What have we got here now ? CORBIN TEEL ( Quietly ) A man with nothing . If I knew how , I 'd spell it out to you . Lowest man on earth . TICE HOGAN That 's right . CORBIN TEEL No more no fuckin ' less . TICE HOGAN Hmmm . I 'd say you 're a little more than less . What do you think , Cali ? And look at the battle scar on that leg . CORBIN TEEL Yeah . A hole right down to the bone . Maybe that 's where I lost all my property . ( Tice jumps up as though he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just wait a damn minute . I think . I think I 've had a revelation . I 've beenwrong . Yes . Wrong ! There 's nothing changed here . You 're not a naked man , but an idiot to take off your clothes , degrade yourself and insult a woman that I do declare was actually beginning to like you . p. 85 CORBIN TEEL Cali ? TICE HOGAN ( to Cali ) Leave the room , daughter . ( Cali lets the clothes in her arms drop , then she walks a few steps away and stops ) CORBIN TEEL Cali . Please . TICE HOGAN You 're looking sort of goose pimply too . Are you cold ? CORBIN TEEL ( to Cali 's back ) I took the ticket . Like you take a drink of water . Yeah . I did n't know what it all meant but I knew it would clear a path to walk on . And it would give me some little bit of hope that I would n't be last . That someone else would do that for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am ? TICE HOGAN Blow me down , not sentiment . CORBIN TEEL Could you want me as I was n't made to be ? ( Cali turns around . She keeps her eyes on Corbin 's eyes and does not look him over . She comes in close to him ) CORBIN TEEL I 'll stop being what I am . Your father says it 's possible . CALI HOGAN In here , not out there . ( beat ) You want to fuck my father . TICE HOGAN Cali ! p. 86 CORBIN TEEL Shit . CALI HOGAN You want to fuck me . ( Corbin grabs Cali 's collar and tries to pull her closer , but Cali stands her ground ) . TICE HOGAN Let go of her ! ( Cali holds our her arm to warn her father off ) CALI HOGAN You want to get so deep down in our minds that we ca n't let you go . Well it wo n't happen Mr. Teel . I wo n't let that happen . CORBIN TEEL ( Quietly ) Touch me . ( Cali @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Please . ( Tice looks away from them . Cali slowly but firmly removes his hand from her collar , then she turns and leaves the room . Corbin just stands there . Then he takes a seat next to Tice . They sit in silence together for a long moment ) CORBIN TEEL Whatever I am. ( beat ) I am a man . TICE HOGAN Yeah . That you are . And I 'm an apple seed . end scene two p. 87 Act 2 , Scene 3 SCENE THREE ( A small chopping block rolls into the room , from another direction than in scene one . Then a very small log rolls in after it . Tice follows , proudly carrying the ax . He lines up the small log and gets ready to swing . He hesitates . The alignment is n't quite right . He adjusts it again . He swings back with the ax . Just then Cali enters ) CALI HOGAN There 's my ax . TICE HOGAN Yes . Yes . Here 's your ax and it 's Friday today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire . ( Cali stares at the little log ) CALI HOGAN Log . More like a piece of straw . TICE HOGAN Never underestimate the power of the little ones . ( Beat ) He 's out back . CALI HOGAN What if someone  --  TICE HOGAN No one 'll see him . I 've hung your sheets in a circle . CALI HOGAN What for ? TICE HOGAN He 's having a bath . I gave him some of that soap you use . CALI HOGAN That soap belongs to the Graftons . For their sheets only . TICE HOGAN He 's leaving tomorrow . Begged me for a bath . Ca n't have him leave this house all stinked up and yellow . ( After some moments : ) p. 88 CALI HOGAN Daddy , he wants me . TICE HOGAN Yeah . He wants you , Cali . But he ca n't have you . So I 've been telling him he should look around . Lot 's of women like you in the party . Talking smart and loud . Strong arms . Not afraid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meetin ' . TICE HOGAN No , he may never get to a meeting but I tell you he 's going out of this house a changed man . He had no eagerness when he came in . Spirit all flickering dull in the back of his skull , ' bout to go out . And a meanness in his eyes , like small change . All these days , I 've been stoking that little flame . Yeah , I 've been bringing it back to life . And a flame like that is hungry . Not just for learning but for flesh so I told him there were some very fine revolutionary comrades in the Party , or real close to it . CALI HOGAN ( Weary ) YeahHelen Longs , Estelle Milner , Cornelia Foreman . TICE HOGAN Alice Mosely . Addie Adkins . Eula Gray . CALI HOGAN No . TICE HOGAN You 're the same as them , Cali . It 's where you belong . You just do n't know it . CALI HOGAN Let me have my own damn life . p. 89 TICE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . CALI HOGAN This is n't yours to say . TICE HOGAN He 's not made to love you . CALI HOGAN Well , he makes me wonder . TICE HOGAN He makes you wonder . Oh Jesus spare me . CALI HOGAN And then something goes . Pop inside , when he makes me laugh . TICE HOGAN He makes you pop inside ? Huh . What are you , a piece of corn ? CALI HOGAN Do n't you dare make fun of me . TICE HOGAN There 's things we do n't know about him . CALI HOGAN There 's things you do n't know about me . TICE HOGAN Listen to me . I am saying this as your father : not now and not when he leaves this house . CALI HOGAN So this is what you 've become ? No room in that head of yours left for feeling ? TICE HOGAN Feel all you want . I 'm warning you not to touch . CALI HOGAN I ca n't love without touchin ' ! TICE HOGAN Well damn it , learn to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CALI HOGAN Leave me alone . I heard you . TICE HOGAN It 's a thing you just ca n't take up in your arms . Sometimes love 's behind you , where you ca n't touch it . Rosie , yeah , Rosie 's a good woman and there 's a lot of her to touch , and one of these days I might just decide to do some more of that touching , but behind me , still breathing on my neck , is your mother , Isabel . And today , that 's still enough for me . Yeah , you think I 'm dried up . Got no sense left in my body . You 're wrong , girl . I 've got a body ' bout as wide as an ocean . Isabel , she ploughed her hands deep in me , and when she got finished , I was something else all together , not just for loving her , but for loving and wanting another kind of Alabama . No , another kind of world , one I could n't see , not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round the corner . ( Beat ) The way Corbin looks at you , I know that look . And the way you look back , I know that too . But watch out . Love like that can make you think you 've got the world fixed between the two of you . But that 's only half . You stop there , you do n't use that ocean out past this room , out past this city line , it 's just gon na . Stop being ocean . And one day you 'll wake and look out and that ocean 's just an old pond out back , even the fish have left it . ( Some moments of silence ) CALI HOGAN I wo n't leave you , father . p. 91 TICE HOGAN I 'm not afraid of being left . CALI HOGAN Then what is it ? TICE HOGAN Something 's woke up inside you . But just do n't let it be him . Use what he makes you feel , but take it somewhere else . You 're breathing fire , girl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CALI HOGAN I am not a dragon ! Stop turning everythin ' into everythin ' else . I am not wakin ' up . I never went to sleep to begin with . But like you , I once loved . Only my husband , he never talked to me . Really talked to me and looked me in the face . Do you know what mean ? That was my first disappointment . Then he died and I did n't miss him . That was my second disappointment for I 'd sort of looked forward to finally feelin ' something deep . That kinda life and folks leave you alone . TICE HOGAN He 's not the one . CALI HOGAN But you like him . I 've never seen you work so hard to teach a man to read . He 's under your skin . TICE HOGAN No . CALI HOGAN And he 's under mine too . That 's what he wants . What he 's working for . TICE HOGAN Then stay out of his way . Look , Cali . He 's a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be just you and me again . Let 's leave it at that . Better idea , you show me how to swing . p. 92 CALI HOGAN But Daddy  --  TICE HOGAN ( Tice takes up the ax again ) Have n't done this in a while . Thought I might start buildin ' up my arms a bit . Long fight ahead of us . Who knows , might even get real good . Enter the competition at the county fair end of the month . ( Tice raises the ax and looks at Cali ) CALI HOGAN First thing is , you 've got to loosen that grip . You hold on too tight and it wo n't split the wood . That 's right . ( Cali puts her hand on the ax and makes him lower it ) But you do n't do it in this house cause choppin wood inside a house is the second sign of madness . TICE HOGAN What 's the first ? ( Cali takes the ax from him ) CALI HOGAN Entertainin ' the thought that you 'll ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got . end scene three p. 93 Act 2 , Scene 4 SCENE FOUR ( Corbin is alone . Polishing his shoes . Cali enters . She just stands there and watches him ) . CORBIN TEEL Just trying to put some shine back in my shoes . You sorry about me leavin ' ? CALI HOGAN More room in this room after you 're gone . No . CORBIN TEEL I do n't believe you . CALI HOGAN Suit yourself . CORBIN TEEL Hey . You do n't say sir anymore . Like you used to . But I like it that you do n't use it too . It makes us more familiar . ( Beat ) I think you are . Delightful . CALI HOGAN Delightful . A fancy word . CORBIN TEEL I 'm gettin fancier by the minute . I can spell my name out now . And this morning your father learned me that in the 1930 election campaign , the communist party endorsed a black candidate for governor : Walter Lewis . No political party 's done that since reconstruction  --  CALI HOGAN Corbin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history . But here 's another little piece for you my own Daddy likes to forget . 1929 . John Owens , in the national . He was dead set against bringing colored folks into the communist party ' cause  --  and for your benefit I 'll quote  --  ( She imitates John Owen 's voice ) : " the vast majority of Southern Negroes are not revolutionary , not even radical . Given a society of peace , prosperity and security , they are content to drift through life . " p. 94 CORBIN TEEL Oh . CALI HOGAN You ever met anyone who was content to drift though life ? I have not . CORBIN TEEL Owens . Huh . Sounds like a man still using his ticket . CALI HOGAN And how do you sound like a man ? ( Corbin considers this , then makes a series of strange , new noises . Cali bursts out laughing ) CORBIN TEEL A new kind of creature . That 's all me . ( Beat ) When you laugh . ( Corbin hesitates ) CALI HOGAN Do n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CALI HOGAN Oh , go on then . CORBIN TEEL When you laugh . I hear . Haydn . CALI HOGAN Haydn . When did you ever hear Haydn ? CORBIN TEEL Never did . But your father says there 's this Ted Wellman . Russian Jew . Known for his . Marxian interpretation . Of a Haydn symphony . ( beat ) I figure it must be . Interesting music . CALI HOGAN Interesting . p. 95 CORBIN TEEL And beautiful to the ear . CALI HOGAN Rather have something from your mouth than Haydn . CORBIN TEEL You think your father 's wrong ? CALI HOGAN I think children play . Just as we do . CORBIN TEEL Then maybe it 's time you left your Daddy 's house . You 're not his wife . CALI HOGAN No , I 'm not . But watch your step , Mr. Teel . I am my father 's friend . And he is mine . That kind of thing , you do n't know . CORBIN TEEL Kiss me . CALI HOGAN No . CORBIN TEEL Look . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CALI HOGAN A kiss wo n't teach you to read . CORBIN TEEL I bet you have n't kissed a man since your husband got sick and died . CALI HOGAN Better you get back to your books . You do n't have much time left . CORBIN TEEL But a kiss falls under the same . Category . As a book . CALI HOGAN Really . p. 96 CORBIN TEEL And is the best . Instrument . For teaching a cracker ' bout . Dialectical materialism . CALI HOGAN Christ . CORBIN TEEL Not sure it 's something he 'd 've understood . ( As Corbin speaks the following , he does so as if remembering a lesson , but adding his own as he goes ) The way I 've come to learn it from your father is everythin ' is . Material . At this moment , now , that 's our mouths too . And change happens through the . Struggle of opposites . That being your mouth and my mouth . Locked in struggle . Cause everythin ' is made up of different . Elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposing forces . Leads to growth , change and development . ( Beat ) You need to kiss me so that I can have my development . CALI HOGAN I think Marx was talking about class , not kiss . ( As Corbin speaks the following he slowly takes steps towards Cali ) CORBIN TEEL I 'm dyin ' here , Cali . Dyin ' of a Dialectical disadvantage . I 've got no way to really comprehend how it all works . CALI HOGAN And my mouth is . Your book . ( Corbin now stands face to face with Cali ) CORBIN TEEL That 's a fact . ( He speaks as though quoting ) But I 'm not there yet . And I 've got to make it there so I can be right here . ' Cause half way lost is worse than being gone . ( Beat ) Made that bit up myself . You like it ? p. 97 CALI HOGAN I like it better this time with your clothes on . ( Beat ) There 's nothing here for you , with me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( She does ) CALI HOGAN I do n't need to look at you to see you , Corbin Teel . One thing I never liked ' bout white men . There 's no tomorrow in their face . CORBIN TEEL Take another look at my face . Maybe you can find something there . ( Cali just looks at him , then he slowly moves to kiss her . As he does so , Cali raises her hand to cover her mouth , so her palm will catch his kiss . Corbin hesitates only slightly and then kisses the palm of her hand , as though it were her mouth . The two of them are not touching each other , except through her hand . Then Corbin quits and turns away from her . They stand in silence some moments . Cali looks at the palm of her hand . Corbin turns away from her ) CORBIN TEEL I think if they did n't go back to those houses . The sheets you wash . I think those folks 'd use their fuckin ' money to sleep on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gift from God sent to keep them warm . Me , I been cold all my life . end scene four p. 98 Act 2 , Scene 5 SCENE FIVE ( Tice and Corbin together . Corbin is agitated . Tice is very calm . He has got an old cloth and he 's wrapping a few things up in it for Corbin 's travel . He holds the items up for Corbin to see . First , a piece of string ) TICE HOGAN A piece of string for your travels . Never know when something might up and fall off and you have to tie it back on . ( He holds up a plate that 's missing a big chunk out of it , polishes it , and puts it in the pile ) A dinner plate . For eating . Can use it as a mirror too . ( Beat ) A piece of cheese . CORBIN TEEL That 's not cheese . TICE HOGAN Well , that 's not its fault . But I assure you it 's edible . And some bread to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I should hate you . Lots of people do . TICE HOGAN You still might . CORBIN TEEL Why . Why do you think they hate you ? TICE HOGAN Do n't know . Maybe ' cause we 're the best kind of . Citizen . To see us makes them feel ashamed . ( Tice ties up the bundle for Corbin ) You want to love your country ? Then you got to take it by the scruff of the neck and kiss it smack , hard , right on the mouth and you do n't let go of that kiss ' til she does three somersaults and ends up upside down , standing on her head , feet in the air , givin ' her soles the first good view of the sky they ever had . p. 99 CORBIN TEEL Shit . ( Corbin turns away from Tice , disturbed ) TICE HOGAN Well , you got to get through that too , Corbin . But along the way , there 's diamonds . CORBIN TEEL Diamonds . Hell . Why 'd you join the party in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times . Shot at . Beat up . Scared most of your days . TICE HOGAN Well , justice , maybe . ( Corbin begins to get angrier while Tice just gets calmer ) CORBIN TEEL Nah . Justice . Justice . Do n't give me that . Why 'd you join ? Why did Tice Hogan join the Communist party rather than walk on by and get on with his life ? TICE HOGAN Because I do n't like being alone . And neither do you . CORBIN TEEL Damn you . Answer me . TICE HOGAN Few years back , first big meeting I went to in Birmingham . ' Bout seven hundred colored folk , maybe a hundred whites . At Capitol Park , protesting the arrests of six fine communists in Atlanta . To the left of me , Hosea Hudson . The man sweats justice . To the right of me , an old woman , jumping up and down with the vigour of a child . ( Takes a huge breath ) And suddenly I was breathing deep . And I mean God deep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in church , but I never stood in a crowd like that . We were shouting for work relief , shouting ' gainst segregation . But it was n't just the words that took me up . It was a kind of . Humming . All those bodies together , yearning in that hot May sun . I 've held women in my arms , yeah . And my own child . But it was the first time I did n't feel . Alone . p. 100 CORBIN TEEL Almost a miracle , huh ? TICE HOGAN Almost . CORBIN TEEL Well , the thing about miracles is they do n't hold . Afterwards , the crowd goes home . And you 're twice alone . TICE HOGAN You got a fever ? You 're sweatin ' . ( Tice nears Corbin to touch his forehead and check his temperature but Corbin jumps back like he 'll be burned ) You that scared to leave this house ? ( Corbin laughs nervously ) Want us to sit down one last time and write out your name ? It 's got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TICE HOGAN T.E.E.L. CORBIN TEEL No , god damn it . I do n't give a fuck about ever seeing my name on a piece of paper again . You 're just like a school girl . Put a ribbon in your hair . I 'm sick of it . God damn it I did n't need it before , I ca n't use it now . TICE HOGAN Your profanity is not a testament to your enlarged vocabulary . CORBIN TEEL You know what . Yeah . We 're different you and me . But it 's not just about tickets . You 've got a roof . You 've got clothes . TICE HOGAN And two books . p. 101 CORBIN TEEL You . You 're one of those nice people . You think you 're better than me . TICE HOGAN I think we could work togeth- CORBIN TEEL ( Interrupts ) I do n't want to work with you . I do n't want anything with you . I just want to walk out of this house and forget it all . Forget TICE HOGAN  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , god damn it . Forget that I ever tried . To be somethin ' different . ( Tice now lightly smacks the back of Corbin 's head , as though reprimanding him ) TICE HOGAN But you are different . CORBIN TEEL No . I 'm not . ( Tice smacks him again ) TICE HOGAN Yes . You are . CORBIN TEEL No . I am not . ( Tice smacks him again , harder ) TICE HOGAN You are . CORBIN TEEL You ca n't change a fucking stone . TICE HOGAN A man is not a stone . ( Suddenly Corbin 's razor is at Tice 's throat ) p. 102 CORBIN TEEL Then I am not a man . ( Tice is completely calm , almost ) CORBIN TEEL I need three names . People you know . People like you . Core of the party . TICE HOGAN And then what ? CORBIN TEEL Then . Well . It 's nothin ' personal , but I 'll have to stick you . My own life depends on it . TICE HOGAN The lowan stooge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I killed a foreman . TICE HOGAN Suppose I should be honoured . If TCI thinks I 'm better off dead , then we must be making a difference . CORBIN TEEL Nah . They read me out a dozen names . I just picked one I liked the sound of . I picked Tice cause it rhymes with . Lice . Easy to remember . TICE HOGAN John Friar , Buddy Wall . CORBIN TEEL Christ . I did n't even have to cut you first . ( Puts the knife closer to Tice 's skin ) One more . TICE HOGAN Michael Grimes . ( Corbin releases him but keeps the knife out and ready to use ) p. 103 CORBIN TEEL You surprised ? TICE HOGAN Nah . I knew what you were . From the start . Just was n't sure how you 'd go about it . CORBIN TEEL Bullshit . TICE HOGAN Oh yeah . But I thought to myself " Tice Hogan . You 'll never have a chance like this at your door again . Let him in . Go to work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make me a better man . TICE HOGAN No . That 's where you 're wrong . It was all about the challenge . If I could turn a snitch like you into a comrade , there would n't be a thing outside this house that could stop me . Not a thing . And I 'd blow apart that noise inside my ear I fight every damn day that says , " Human nature does n't change " . " You ca n't remake the world " . If I could change a man like you , Hallelujah . What 's next ? ( beat ) This is n't about you . It never was about you . That 's just yourself telling you lies . CORBIN TEEL I do n't believe you . TICE HOGAN I used you . CORBIN TEEL No . We were friends . TICE HOGAN I never gave a fuck about you , Corbin Teel . I do n't even like you . ( Corbin slams Tice into the table , then hard onto the ground . Then he drags him across the floor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as though he were trying to get Tice 's body to disappear . Tice hardly resists and in doing so , is less harmed ) p. 104 CORBIN TEEL Well , now I 'll teach you something : you are not a God . God performs miracles , not you . Who gave you the right ? Who gave you the power to reach down into a man 's soul and twist it ' til he does n't recognise it himself . Well , you know why it did n't work ? ' Cause some of us lucky ones , we 've got no soul . All that reading , all that talk , talk , talk . It all goes to hell , to hell for a handful of change . That simple . And that 's what they 're gon na give me . ( Corbin quits ) What you forgot : my stomach . TICE HOGAN Food 's not all we need . CORBIN TEEL Bullshit . TICE HOGAN I just made a poor bet , that 's all . CORBIN TEEL And you lost . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spits in his face . Corbin calmly wipes it off and just stares at Tice ) ( Quietly ) You fuckin ' lost . TICE HOGAN Yeah . I believe I did . And you know what you 're doing ? CORBIN TEEL What ? ( Tice says the following slowly , with sincerity ) TICE HOGAN You are breaking my heart . CORBIN TEEL God damn your arrogance . Take a look at me , Tice Hogan . Take a look at me . ( Corbin brings the knife close to Tice and seems about to cut him . But suddenly Cali is there , at their side . She holds the knife , the one we saw Tice making in the Act Two prologue , to Corbin 's throat ) p. 105 CALI HOGAN You 're going to kill my father , then be quick . I ca n't stop you . But by the time your blade is half way ' cross his throat , I 'll stick my knife in yours . You 'll bleed to death before you get to the road . Do n't underestimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin rabbits . I may 've been stupid enough to fall for a man like you but I can cut you out of my heart so fast it wo n't miss a beat . ( After some moments , Corbin releases Tice . He faces Cali and her knife ) Here . Take these notes with you . ( Cali holds out to Corbin a couple of printed pages , folded up . Hardly glancing at the papers , Corbin takes them , slowly , from Cali 's hand ) They 'll tell your bosses more than they need to know about the inner workings of the party . Now get out . ( Cali throws the bag at Corbin . Corbin just stands there , looking at her ) CORBIN TEEL So . You do want me . CALI HOGAN Yes . ( Beat ) And I hope you die .

She walks slowly to different corners of the room as though considering the different spaces . Then she seems to find where she wants to be . Then she lies down on her back and is still . After some moments , Tice comes into the room , carrying his two books . He regards his daughter in silence . Then , he lies down elsewhere in the room , on his back . They lie like this together , quietly ) . CALI HOGAN You ever notice there 's a crack in the ceiling looks like a wheelbarrow . TICE HOGAN More like the map of a city . CALI HOGAN Or a beetle . TICE HOGAN See there , a row of houses . And there , a row of trees . CALI HOGAN No birds in the sky . TICE HOGAN Just ca n't see ' em . They 're living in the houses . It 's the folks that 're hanging in the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You betrayed your friends . TICE HOGAN Yeah . I got to looking at him so hard , I forgot ' bout looking ahead .

She takes them ) CALI HOGAN What should I do with them ? p. 108 TICE HOGAN I do n't care . ( beat ) Those names I gave him . They 're names of board members at TCI . ( They silently regard one another for some moments ) CALI HOGAN Could he know that ? TICE HOGAN I do n't know . ( Cali puts the books back on the table ) CALI HOGAN I 've got to go . Meeting Estelle on the corner . TICE HOGAN You are the apple of my eye , Cali . There 's no changing that . ( Cali leaves the house . Tice stares absentmindedly about the room . Then his eyes fix on his books . He purposely takes a chair and drags it to the other side of the room , as far from the books as he can sit . He sits , determinedly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and in a rage , smashes the chair against the floor . A leg breaks off it . Tice 's rage now vanishes . He tries to set the chair back upright . He ca n't , but determined as ever , he sits on the chair anyway , as though it were not broken . And strangely , he finds a way to balance himself on its three legs . He sits still , quietly for some moments ) TICE HOGAN Ca n't change human nature . That 's a fact . Right . ( He glances at the books on the table , then speaks to them ) Right ? Christ . Take a look at yourselves . You 're just damn books . ( Beat ) It 's your nature to dream .

Then again the soft knocking ) TICE HOGAN Yeah . Wo n't ever leave us alone . ( After some moments , Tice goes to the door . He pauses a moment , then opens it . It 's Corbin . He looks tired and sick . But he tries to sound perky ) CORBIN TEEL I 'm looking for Tice Hogan . Word is he might help me . TICE HOGAN Tice Hogan 's dead . Hireling for TCI cut his throat . CORBIN TEEL Bastard . What was his name ? TICE HOGAN Corbin Teel . CORBIN TEEL What happened to him ? TICE HOGAN They cut off both his feet . CORBIN TEEL Damn . ( Beat ) But I heard it different . Heard Corbin Teel was a good snitch . That he gave the men at TCI some names . That they laughed for a long time . Do n't know why . One of those men in the suits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck a knife in Corbin 's side . He asked them why . They did n't even hear him , just stepped over his body and moved on . ( Tice stands aside to let him in . Then Corbin steps inside . His shaking hands are covering the wound in his side , under his shirt . Cali just looks at him . Corbin does his best to act like he 's all right ) p. 111 TICE HOGAN Have a seat . CORBIN TEEL I 've pissed in my pants . TICE HOGAN So have I , on occasion . ( Corbin sits , Tice examines his wound . It looks bad ) CALI HOGAN Go get someone . CORBIN TEEL It 's too late . TICE HOGAN Let the man die . CALI HOGAN No .

CORBIN TEEL I do n't know . ( Silence some moments ) CALI HOGAN Went out dancin ' since you 've been gone . CORBIN TEEL Only been gone three days . CALI HOGAN Went to a Party meetin ' too . Decided to join . CORBIN TEEL Why 'd you do it ? CALI HOGAN I do n't know . Desire , maybe . CORBIN TEEL Hell . CALI HOGAN I 'm not talking about that kind of desire , touching the body of someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second . I 'm talking about the kind of desire that wakes you when it 's still dark and you go outside and even the ground at your feet is asleep . But then you listen real hard and you hear the world waking up , leaves talking about things you forgot , insects making a quarrel , and then a little piece of morning comes to rest on your neck . That kind of desire . That everything out there 's a gift . It 's that simple . Me , you , my father , the rest of us . We were n't born to live broken lives . ( Beat ) Why 'd you come back ? CORBIN TEEL Sleepin ' on this floor , night after night . Sound of your father turnin ' those pages . Like a lullaby . No . Like something else . I do n't know . And then there was you , there just in the next room . Even when I was asleep I was more awake that I 'd ever been . ( Cali just looks at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress . Corbin watches but then he stops her ) Don't. p. 113 CALI HOGAN I want you to see me . CORBIN TEEL Candy for a dying man ?

( Cali buttons up her dress again ) CORBIN TEEL Do n't ( Cali stops ) CALI HOGAN Make up your god damn mind . ( Cali kisses Corbin suddenly . He 's taken aback ) CORBIN TEEL Never met a woman like you . Hard nosed . Arrogant . Persistent . Just like your father . ( Corbin muffles a cry . He holds onto the chair , as though it could keep him afloat ) A fucking communist through and through . ( Beat ) That 's a compliment . ( Corbin starts to shake . He is dying ) Cali . Just sit with me . I 'm scared . Cali . Let me touch you . ( Cali stands beside him . After some moments , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CALI HOGAN Be quiet . Close your eyes . ( Corbin does so . Cali takes his hand . He moans ) Be still . ( Cali moves his hand to different places on her body as she speaks , and not necessarily sexual places on her body , but also on her ribs , her breast-bone , her arm , elbow ) Here is where I cut myself as a child . Here , where I burned when the fields caught fire . Here is where my mother touched me . I ca n't remember , but I know it 's her . This is where I stripped the corn . This is where I slept too long . And this place , here , you can never know . p. 114 CORBIN TEEL Cali . ( Corbin is still . He is dead ) CALI HOGAN And this is where you knocked on the door . ( Cali takes his hand from her body and puts it gently back on the table ) @x ( Tice enters . He is in his travelling clothes again . The same ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , we see Corbin 's body still sitting there . In the darkness , Cali stands a few feet away , looking elsewhere , still ) TICE HOGAN Funny thing about time is , not how it does n't come back to you . But how it does.I did n't leave the party . Did for a little while . But then it got real cold . My daughter was always up and gone , travelling with those mettlesome women , delirious comrades carrying sticks and beatin back the smothering world . And Cali forgot to chop the wood for the fire . So I went back over to Tucker 's house . He always had it roaring . And from there , all those years went flashing past us , sparked up in jail time , hiding under floor boards and always . Always . That deeply underrated and American phenomenon : the persistent murdering of resistance , ( beat ) That 's thirtyfour letters . I still take the time to count.Some of the things we did in those years , well , they fell apart . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lasted ? Yeah , what lasted . That 's always the question that finally comes to us . Shhh . There it is again . Listen . ( Tice makes a soft humming noise , which lasts one long breath , but it is as though it were coming from outside him . It echoes ) p. 116 A humming that 'd be felt for decades , if you knew where to put your ear to the wall , if you knew how to listen . ( Tice takes an apple from his pocket ) One in my head . One in my throat . One in the mattress . Three bullets in all.I was asleep . It was some years after Corbin . We 'd just got a union started at the new plant . A few cents more 's all we got . Bit it was worth it . They were thugs for the management , and some officers too . But they did n't get my daughter . Nah . Cali was out late that evening , holding a meeting to unionize workers in the fields.They say fires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah , I can go with that , and that it 's in the nature of the dream of a better world to collapse at the feet of it 's tiresome dreamers . Just how it is , that 's all.Inevitable . Predictable . Yeah . But then there 's another story . The one about the apples that fell off the tree and decided to take a walk in the other direction . They even grew little feet to walk with . ( Uses another voice for the following : ) " But it 's not in their nature . Apples do true nature is to swim , or to fly . It just has n't found the right ramp for take-off . Maybe the apple is a friend . Maybe this here fruit can break your heart . ( Tice holds the apple up to his ear ) Or maybe it 's a clock . Tick , tock . Tick , tock . Tick , Tice . That 's me . Tice Hogan . Time to go home . Time to make that fast , flying , fuck of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to exit , then stops ) p. 117 Or hey , maybe , just maybe , an apple is a letter from another world . The world that walks behind us . The world that wo n't let us go . The world that whispers : " We lived . We lived . Oh listen to our call . " And all you have to do . ( Tice takes out the knife he had in the second prelude . Tice neatly cuts the apple in two ) Is open it . Read what it says on the inside . And then , get to work . ( Tice reads what the apple says on the inside ) Well I 'll be damned . ( Tice studies the public , then he smiles . He squats and carefully puts the pieces of apple on the stage floor . He stands up , no longer smiling at the audience , just looking at them . Then he exits . A light lights the apple pieces , very brightly . As though they were burning in another world . Then the lights go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
