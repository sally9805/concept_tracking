Lee Benson Jr . is still waiting for a hard foul . In the six months since he traded his prison jumpsuit for the uniform of Brown Mackie junior college in Salina , Kans. , Benson , a 6 ' 11 " , 231-pound freshman center , has suffered bruises , bumps , hacks and clawing triple teams , but he has encountered nothing like the body blows he endured on virtually every shot he took during 8 ? years of prison ball . " Those games were tough , " he says . " We played by the no-layup rule because you could get hurt going inside . You were forced to shoot jumpers. " // A well-developed outside game is only one reason Benson has been attracting the attention of NBA scouts , even though he 's 28 years old and admittedly rusty . " He has huge hands , long arms and a great court temperament , " says one NBA scout of Benson , who through Sunday led Division II junior colleges in scoring , at 35.4 points per game , and ranked second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor well and is clever around the basket . Problem is , he 's 28 and could be 31 before he 's ready to play . But his body is lively and well-preserved . He looks like he 's 19. " // Benson has matured immeasurably in the last 10 years , but he says that physically he does n't feel much different than he did as a junior at Dunbar High in Dayton in 1990-91 , when he was named co-MVP of the city league after averaging 22.5 points and 18.0 rebounds and drew interest from scores of schools , including Cincinnati and Oklahoma . When his coach quit before his senior season , Benson did n't play ball , got behind in school , dropped out and later that year headed for Independence ( Kans . ) Community College . He left there after a few weeks , when he learned he could n't play basketball until the following year . // Benson returned to Dayton and began hanging out with " the wrong people , " he says . In January 1992 he was arrested for auto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was suspended . Three months later Benson fired a gun while arguing with a man over a previous drug deal . Benson then forced the man to go to a nearby apartment , where the man told Benson he would make a phone call to try to clear things up . Benson was charged and convicted of abduction and gun possession . In a separate case Benson pleaded guilty to three counts of drug trafficking . He was sentenced to a total of 10-to-25 years in prison . // Mackie Brown coach Francis Flax heard about Benson from Benson 's cousin Marcus Stewart , who played on Flax 's 1999 Division II junior college championship team , but he did n't think of pursuing him . Then on a trip to Dayton in the spring of 2000 , Flax stopped in to see Colonel White High biology and physics teacher Lee Benson , whose 6 ' 6 " son , Prince , had been on Flax 's recruiting list the year before . Pulling out a scrapbook and a stack of nine-year-old press clippings , a teary-eyed Benson told Flax , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NBA , but he 's in prison . " // Intrigued , Flax began to correspond with Lee Jr . and in August 2000 secured a permit to visit him at the Warren Correctional Institution in Lebanon , Ohio . " We talked for about 2 ? hours , and I saw a good person there , " says Flax . As he was leaving , Flax noticed on a prison transcript that Lee Jr . had become eligible for parole in December 1998 . Flax called the elder Benson and encouraged him to hire a lawyer to speed up his son 's release . After an agreement between the Ohio and Kansas parole boards was worked out , Lee Jr . walked out of prison on Aug. 17 , 2001. // Flax was there waiting for him , and within three weeks , Benson had earned his GED and enrolled at Brown Mackie , a 350-student school located between a Mister Penguin Tuxedo Rental and a Domino 's Pizza in Salina . Benson had much to get acquainted with , including the Internet , cell phones , Flax 's brutal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying bricks  --  and a populace that embraced him despite his background . " I really like it here , " says Benson . " It 's peaceful , and the people are the nicest people I 've ever met in my life . " // Though at least one NBA scout says he is willing to bet that Benson will play in the NBA , Benson is n't getting too far ahead of himself . " My main focus now is staying straight , " says Benson , whose parole does n't end until August . " Wherever I go from here , I do n't want to go back . "
