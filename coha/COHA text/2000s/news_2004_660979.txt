<p> Imagine this scenario : Computer hackers working for Al Qaeda break into Russia 's nuclear weapons network , and " spoof " the system into believing it is under attack , setting off a chain reaction , and a real nuclear counterattack . <p> Another doomsday possibility made headlines when Ayman al-Zawahiri , Osama bin Laden 's No. 2 , was quoted last month boasting that Al Qaeda had already acquired " some suitcase bombs " - radioactive material packed with conventional explosives . Mr. Zawahiri said that anything was available for $ 30 million on the Central Asian black market or from disgruntled Soviet scientists . Russia immediately rejected the claim . <p> But such what-ifs are among the nuclear terrorism threats that analysts are reexamining , as the learning curve of terror groups today comes closer to intersecting the vulnerabilities of atomic arsenals . <p> A handful of Russian and American nuclear experts , both military and civilian , are quietly convening a first meeting in Moscow later this month , to launch a year-long modeling exercise to specify the new dangers . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them today , " says Pavel Zolotarev , a former major general in Russia 's Strategic Rocket Forces , which inherited the vast Soviet nuclear arsenal . " There should be no chance that wrong signals get into the system , to provoke a presidential decision to launch . " <p> In the past , top priority in Russia has been protecting its stocks of bomb-grade nuclear material . The US has been spending roughly $ 1 billion per year to upgrade Russia 's nuclear security and dismantle warheads . <p> But experts are now looking at new terror tactics , from hacking to seizing a complete weapon . <p> " The threats are changing in the most radical way , " says Vladimir Dvorkin , a former rocket forces major general , who was head of development for the Russian Defense Ministry 's strategic forces , missile defense , and space systems until 2001 . <p> Cyberwarfare meets 50s tech <p> Ironically , Russia 's older systems may be less vulnerable than US weaponry to the most cutting-edge threats , particularly cyberwarfare . <p> Russia 's strict centralized control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it " harder , at some level , for terrorists to do something to break the safeguards and launch , " says Bruce Blair , a nuclear security expert and former Minuteman launch officer who heads the Center for Defense Information in Washington ( CDI ) . <p> In contrast , the US Department of Defense infrastructure consists of over 2.1 million computers , with 10,000 local area networks , and 1,000 long-distance networks . <p> Danger from hackers <p> Hackers have been active against government networks , if targeted US systems are any gauge . Mi2g , a digital security analyst company based in London , found that 2003 yielded a " meteoric rise in electronic crime , " and that along with criminal scams , " extremist group activity " had risen by several hundred percent . <p> The sobering results of the still- classified work by a Pentagon " Commission on Nuclear Fail-Safe " - to which Mr. Blair testified about Soviet nuclear safeguards , inside a vault at the Pentagon around 1992 - point to US vulnerabilities that could also apply to Russian systems today . Investigators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navy 's system for broadcasting nuclear launch orders to Trident submarines . <p> " This deficiency allowed unauthorized hackers , which could be terrorists or high school mischief makers , to potentially insert a launch order and transmit it to the Trident , " Blair says . The gap was so serious that Navy launch order verifications had to be revised . <p> Indeed , few systems are safe . The US National Security Agency hired 35 hackers in 1997 to simulate a cyberterrorist attack . They were able to break into defense networks and shut down parts of the power grid and emergency services . <p> Such risks prompted the UN 's nuclear watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency , to hold a first meeting on the issue of vulnerable electronic systems in October 2002 . <p> " We are aware of the problem and addressing it as part of our broader nuclear security , " says an IAEA official in Vienna . " It goes hand in hand with the ability of hackers to get into supposedly secure systems . " <p> Russia 's early warning and launch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any way to the Internet or other outside portals , so it is widely deemed here to be secure . Like US nuclear command and control - some elements of which were built in the 1950s and 1960s - Russia relies on an antiquated system . <p> " It 's like having a first generation Mercedes Benz that no modern repair center can fix , " says Maxim Shingarkin , a former major in the 12th Main Directorate of Russia 's Defense Ministry , which protects the nuclear arsenal . <p> Even when military cables are laid alongside nonmilitary ones , exposing the system to outside access , terrorists could " take the signal , but could not generate it " without being detected , Maj. Shingarkin says . <p> ' Old scrap of metal ' <p> A special project begun in the late 1990s took three years to get a modern computer to recognize and integrate information from " this old scrap of metal " that handles nuclear weapons systems , Shingarkin adds . <p> Even today , perforated punch cards are often used instead of normal computer passwords . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own terror risks , says the CDI 's Blair . " There 's now the question of insider collusion , and if you have people on the inside sharing information about potential vulnerabilities , you quadruple the problem . " <p> $ 750,000 for a can of mercury <p> Tentative first signs of such collusion are already raising red flags , though making the link has n't been easy , says Matthew Bunn , a nuclear expert at Harvard 's Project on Managing the Atom . <p> " The connection between the guy in a position to steal , and Al Qaeda , is a pretty difficult step , " says Mr. Bunn . " It 's not like you can walk in wearing a white turban waving a million dollars around , and expect to get anywhere . " <p> Last year , however , a Russian businessman was found to have offered $ 750,000 for weapons-grade plutonium , and contacted scientists at a key Russian institute , Bunn says . They deceived him by selling him a canister of mercury . <p> The days of the " desperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sites left their posts to forage for food , or electricity to alarms and weapons systems was cut because bills had gone unpaid - are now giving way to the " greedy insider , " Bunn adds . <p> And what money ca n't buy may be more easily acquired by force . <p> The US military has demonstrated this danger by staging successful mock terror attacks on American nuclear facilities that included setting off an improvised nuclear device within minutes on site . Secret Russian test exercises have also broken through security at nuclear sites . <p> Several terror-related events have been raising concern . In four incidents in 2001 and 2002 , Chechens were caught scoping out two nuclear sites - so secret that even their location was supposed to be unknown - and two mobile missiles . <p> Chechen separatists have strong links with Al Qaeda , and have warned explicitly that they might take over a nuclear facility . Few doubt their chutzpah . Russians were shocked when 41 heavily armed Chechens seized a theater in downtown Moscow in October 2002 - a force that could easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is very worrisome , " says Bunn . " The basic assumption is that the intelligence services are so good , they 'll know when intruders are coming . But if they do n't know , they 're going to be in trouble . " <p> Security kits remain in boxes <p> Bureaucracy is blunting the effectiveness of US efforts to tighten Russian nuclear security . Just half of the 123 US-supplied kits for making quick-fix upgrades at secret sites have been installed , four years after delivery . They each include a half a mile of multilayer fencing and an array of intrusion detectors . <p> " A huge part of security for those sites is that nobody knows where they are , " Bunn says . " The upgrade kits are sitting on shelves , and terrorists apparently know where sites are . It 's unbelievable . " <p> Many Russian experts argue , though , that even if a terror group seized a nuclear weapon , they would not be able to use it . American and most Russian intercontinental ballistic missiles have various safeguards that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or require an actual missile launch to arm the warhead . <p> " We ca n't exclude terrorists seizing a missile , but that will be the end of this terrorist act , because they will not be capable of launching it - never , " says Dvorkin , who also discounts chances of an inside job . " There is not a single worker next to a nuclear weapon who is capable of giving this information , because the codes are only known to the highest command . " <p> However , Russia is believed to have around 3,400 live " tactical " nuclear weapons - such as mines and artillery shells , which are sometimes triggered only by radar or radio signals . US experts suspect that these weapons are often not protected by much more than padlocks . <p> Beyond James Bond <p> Still , the amount of foresight Al Qaeda displayed in the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks deepens fears of nuclear terror . <p> " It 's more complicated than slapping on an alarm clock and running a couple of wires , like James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington . " But we believe it 's within the capability of more sophisticated , well-financed groups , especially if they can get their hands on scientists or engineers with knowledge of these systems . " <p> Al Qaeda tops that short list . <p> " Al Qaeda cells are not very capable , technically , but they 're learning more and more , and this is n't going to go away in one or two years , " says David Albright , a physicist who heads the Institute for Science and International Security in Washington . Searching for clues about the level of Al Qaeda nuclear expertise , he has examined troves of documents and videos uncovered in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban . <p> " They make a lot of mistakes , but they 're becoming more capable over time , " says Mr. Albright . Recruiting nuclear and computer experts could make the dangers surge . <p> " People have that capability , they may turn sympathetic to Al Qaeda , or be blackmailed by Al Qaeda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a defense on the premise that Al Qaeda ca n't do it .
