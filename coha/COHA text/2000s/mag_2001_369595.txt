No hype here : there are nearly 11 hours of buried treasures , most of them from the first half century of movies , all rescued and restored by nonprofit institutions . Among the finds in this handsome four-disc set are footage of Orson Welles ' 1936 " Voodoo " Macbeth and Marian Anderson 's 1939 concert at the Lincoln Memorial ; a 1901 trick film transferred from paper prints ; a 1905 ride on a New York City subway ; such avant-garde classics as The Fall of the House of Usher ( 1928 ) and Joseph Cornell 's Rose Hobart ( 1936 ) , a work with such power to shock that Salvador Dali , in the first-night audience , kicked over the projector . Modern viewers should jump for joy at this collection  --  a heroic work of excavation and , at $99.99 , an ideal Valentine 's Day gift for and from film lovers .  --  By Richard Corliss
