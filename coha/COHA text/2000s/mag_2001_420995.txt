Three getaways reveal a different , more natural island , where misty waterfalls , ancient temples , and family adventure await // Sliding the steaming mug across a counter both polished and scarred by years of use , Al Franco smiles and waits for me to sip his coffee . I 'd been drawn into the false-fronted old building by the pungent aroma of roasting coffee beans . While waiting for a pot to fill , Franco explained that his organic coffee is all grown on small farms within walking distance of his tiny restaurant  --  Grandma 's Coffee House  --  high on the slopes of Maui 's Haleakala volcano . I take a sip : The rich , black brew is delicious . With all the vacationers jammed in all the resorts along Maui 's fabled beaches  --  we can see the white sands stretching far below  --  I 'm surprised that there is n't a line lingering out the door . Franco is n't . " A man came in the other day who said he had been staying at the same condo in Kihei for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , " Franco recalls . " The poor guy said he was sorry he waited so long . " That experience is typical of most travelers to Maui . The fact is , the vast majority of the island 's vacationers head to the beach resort areas of Makena , Wailea , Kihei , and Kaanapali  --  and stay there the whole time . They have ample reasons . Maui 's sunny beaches are some of the best in the state and are fronted with shopping , dining , and lodging options for all budgets . Photograph Photograph Island bookends : Hana 's lagoon  --  fronted Hana Hale Malamalama hotel is about as far from West Maui 's beachfront IO restaurant as you can get on an island . Photograph This foaming cascade , tumbling beneath the lush foliage that cloaks a rainforest canyon , is one of many waterfalls along the Hana coast . // Of course , the same intensity of development that makes a vacation along Maui 's west coast so appealing can also make it confining . The most spectacular and least developed corners of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The secret to exploring these hidden gems is taking the time to do it right . Maui 's figure-eight system of roads  --  portions of which are rough and narrow enough in places to make driving a real adventure  --  lends itself to leisurely exploration . Each of the following drives can be a destination in itself . That , I tell Franco  --  just a bit smugly  --  as he tops off my mug , is what I 've been doing for years .

The hotel dining room ( 6:15 PM. - 8:45 P.M. daily ; 808/248-8211 , ext. 133 ) should improve with the arrival of chef Larry Quirit .

On the Hana Hwy. ; ( 800 ) 321-4262 , ( 808 ) 248-8211 , or www.hotelhanamaui.com . There are said to be 54 bridges on the road to Hana , and I always intend to count them . But once again I 'm distracted by the impossible beauty of this torturously twisting , narrow road that runs 44 miles from Paia to Hana . Somebody with a bean counter 's soul has probably tabulated the waterfalls , as well . I just try to spot them all . Early afternoon is the perfect time to go if you intend , as I do , to spend a night or two . By then , visitors who 've made the killer day trip ( from most resorts a six-hour round trip , minimum ) are beginning to straggle back . Tucked between the highway and its placid , horseshoe-shaped harbor , Hana is about as low-key as Maui villages come . The town 's old plantation-style homes , a couple of quirky B &Bs,; and even the posh Hotel Hana-Maui @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem invitingly impervious to change . One continually improving attraction is Kahanu Gardens , a branch of the National Tropical Botanical Garden , Hana native Arnold Lono has worked here for 18 years with his father , Francis , who recently retired after 30 years . In the Hawaiian tradition , Arnold is now taking over the stewardship of the garden 's cultural resources . The garden contains a remarkable collection of some 178 cultivars of breadfruit , but as we walk through the 123-acre site , Lono stresses its cultural heritage . At one time this must have been an important place , with several thousand Hawaiians living in the Hana area , " Lono says , pointing out new plantings for what he calls a canoe garden  --  a plot containing the plants the early Hawaiians brought with them from Polynesia . But what really makes Kahanu Gardens a must for visitors is the view of Piilanihale Heiau , the largest ancient Hawaiian temple in the state . The recently restored , 45-foot-tall temple may be as much as 800 years old , and it is still considered sacred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beach . The choices are incomparably scenic : the black sand beach ( dangerous when surf is up ) at Waianapanapa State Park just north of town , the beach park ( typically the safest swimming ) in town on Hana Bay , and the white sands of my favorite , Hamoa Beach , south of town . I get up early my last morning in Hana to beat the traffic to waterfalls and swimming holes in Oheo Gulch in Kipahulu in the coastal arm of Haleakala National Park . The trailhead parking at the Kipahulu Visitor Center is nearly empty , and I see only a few other hikers on the 1.8  --  mile trail up through guava groves and bamboo forests to Waimoku Falls . On the hike back , I detour down the trail toward the ocean and the series of deep pools in the lower canyon that are perfect for an after-hike dip . Photograph Splash your brother , then run down the black sand beach at Waianapanapa State Park . // About 4 miles beyond Kipahulu ( see rental car caution on page 91 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then winds slowly beneath high bluffs for 2.4 miles to the turnoff to Hui Aloha Church . It is is the perfect place for a picnic : a windswept promontory with stunning views and a simple church dedicated in 1859 . The surprise as you drive here is how quickly the vegetation changes in the rain shadow of Haleakala . A mile farther down the road is Kaupo General Store , an outpost built in 1925 , and the only stop for a cold drink  --  and not much else  --  beyond Hana . This stretch of road used to regularly wash out in hard rains , but a couple of recently built bridges have solved most of that problem . I roll down the dusty window to let the afternoon heat pour in and to better watch the sere coast fall away as I slowly angle up the rugged flank of Haleakala , eventually looping back to Kahului .

The grassy slopes ( I have never seen them not green ) slowly gain shape , revealing the dripping outlines of outcroppings , trees , and stone fences . An hour passes and the sun is still hidden behind Haleakala ( the volcano 's name is Hawaiian for House of the Sun ) , but its light is on the move . First it touches the distant tops of the West Maui Mountains , then it gradually works down to the emerald fields of sugar cane that define the blue , blue waters of Maalaea Bay . As the angled rays creep up the last few hundred yards below my deck , illuminating individual blades of grass and bloodred flowers , the dawn chorus of birdsong begins to fade . Now I understand why Betty Hay Freeland and a surprising number of Maui 's most successful artists choose to live and work Upcountry . Many visitors rushing to explore the colorfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country . From my cottage , I can watch the sunrise in comfort and still be in the park in time for morning birdwatching on the 1/2-mile loop through Hosmer Grove . There would even still be plenty of time to drive to the 10,023-foot-high summit for views or a more difficult hike into the stunningly desolate crater on the aptly named Sliding Sands Trail . Haleakala is on my agenda , but today I 'm meeting Freeland , a landscape artist whose work I 've admired , to learn more about the burgeoning Upcountry arts scene . After meeting for lunch in Makawao , we visit a few of the galleries that have opened in recent years along Baldwin Avenue . Photograph // Viewpoints Gallery is a local cooperative with a little bit of everything from paintings to bronzes . Hot Island Glass makes whimsical jellyfish art and other hand-blown glass items .

Set back on the shady grounds of an old estate , the main gallery of the complex is in a 1917 stucco mansion set in a serene garden . As we walk the grounds , a welcoming breeze rustling leaves , Freeland acknowledges that Maui 's artistic life is changing . The island 's art scene is becoming world-famous . The most successful artists show their work mainly in big galleries in Lahaina and Wailea . But much wonderful , lesser-known work is shown only in smaller galleries Upcountry . Freeland seems more concerned about where she works than what she sells . " It 's still quiet up here , " she says , pausing to admire the light on a line of trees , " and there is an endless supply of inspiration .

" Resist the urge to bounce , " Jason Latas says as we walk beneath the great , spreading branches of a banyan tree . Treading gingerly among the columns of aerial roots supporting the luxuriant green canopy overhead , the leaf-covered ground feels almost like a trampoline. // Latas explains that banyans in the wild develop a dense mat of surface roots . Over the years , soil beneath this mat can gradually erode , leaving a woven surface stretched above the forest floor . " Last week a young girl up here could n't resist the urge to jump , and one of her legs went through the root mat , " he continues . " She was n't hurt , but she was convinced the tree was trying to eat her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups to West Maui sites not open to the public . Our hike was through Maunalei Arboretum , established some 70 years ago by Maui plantation manager D.T Fleming . Long abandoned and undisturbed , Fleming 's collection of exotic plants  --  such as the Moreton Bay pine with its exploding cones  --  is now the wild centerpiece of an easy 4-mile hike . Latas 's other tour options range from an easy walk up a lush valley where taro is still farmed the old way to kayaking and snorkeling West Maui 's ruggedly spectacular coast . The northwestern edge of Maui is admittedly one of the least accessible parts of the island . The plush hotels and condominiums of Kapalua are the closest gateway . The area has no developed parks ; most land is private . The narrow ribbon of roughly paved road snaking around the northern tip of the island is its own destination . Photograph // Packing a picnic , I head out early to Honolua Bay , just north of Kapalua , normally one of the island 's best snorkeling spots but dangerous when waves are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the day-get there by 9 A.M. to find parking . Waterlogged after a morning of snorkeling , I continue beyond Honolua to Maui 's northern tip at Nakalele Point , a dry bluff topping a ragged edge of black lava rock relentlessly pounded by waves . Once the site of a lighthouse , it is also the location of a blowhole . While there is no formal trail here , you can park at the Nakalele Point Light Station sign and , facing the ocean , walk past the Private Property sign and work your way down along the blufftops to the site of the lighthouse . I spread my picnic out nearby and watch the blowhole spew water high above the shoreline  --  high tide offers the best show . Beyond Nakalele the road grows more scenic as it narrows to barely a lane and a half wide in places ; go slow and honk on blind hairpin turns . By the time you reach the village of Kahakuloa , tucked at the lush curve of an impossibly blue bay , you 're ready to stop . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Panini Pua Kea Fruit Stand on weekdays  --  Randy , the stand 's owner , goes fishing on weekends . During summer months you can also get a good shave ice here . Ululani 's pink roadside stand sells polished seed necklaces ; at the green stand on the edge of town , two small , shy girls sell tasty loaves of their mother 's banana bread for $5 ( it 's worth it ) . At the top of a sweeping slope of rangeland beyond the village is Kaukini Gallery , purveyor of local arts and crafts . And then there 's nearly 10 miles of alternating panoramas of mountain and sea as the road twists south to Wailuku . Tired from snorkeling , clambering above the blowhole , and the adrenaline rush of navigating the narrow road , I 'm content to enjoy the scenery as I munch on banana bread . The only thing that would make this drive any better is a rich , black cup of Al Franco 's Haleakala-grown coffee . BEFORE YOU GO Guidebook .
