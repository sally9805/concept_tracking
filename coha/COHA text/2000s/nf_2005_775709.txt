Outsourcing of High-Wage Jobs // The increasing loss of high wage , white collar , and high tech jobs to offshore outsourcing in the past few years has taken Washington by surprise . These were the jobs that were thought to be immune from low wage competition . Outsourcing alone does n't explain the loss of jobs in white collar sectors , and especially in the high tech sector , but it is an increasingly important source of job loss and will only grow in significance . // Since neither economic theory nor Washington policymakers anticipated this phenomenon , there are no reliable statistics on the loss of jobs . Exacerbating the lack of official statistics is the fact that the companies that are moving jobs offshore are keeping the process under wraps , in the hope of avoiding negative publicity . However , some investigative work can begin to bring together the various pieces into a picture that suggests how serious this outward flow has become and what exactly is the nature of the positions that are moving overseas , as well as provide insight into why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // How Much Outsourcing Is Happening ? // Identifying the precise number of jobs being outsourced overseas is difficult , for two primary reasons . First , the federal government does not collect data on jobs shipped overseas . Second , companies are reluctant to reveal which jobs they have shipped overseas and ask their overseas outsourcers to keep quiet about the deals . Companies are so secretive that they are even unwilling to speak at off the record meetings organized by policy think tanks even , refusing to send representative to attend the meetings . These meetings are specifically off the record in order to elicit frank and open discussion among various stakeholders , but in many meetings that we have attended over the past few years , only two companies have spoken openly about their outsourcing plans . Even the organizers of such meetings have been surprised by how few companies are willing to attend . // This lack of a window into corporate planning makes policy design and formulation much more difficult . Without access to corporate executives minds , the best way to gain insight into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years is from independent observers namely , consulting firms that have corporate clients and from company announcements . // Current Estimates of Job Losses // The report that jump started the debate on offshore outsourcing and has had the most influence with business planners and policymakers was done by John McCarthy of Forrester Research , Inc. , a consulting firm . McCarthy predicted that approximately 3.3 million white collar jobs and 136 billion in wages would move overseas by 2015 . It should be noted that the report was released in November 2002 , before offshore outsourcing was a house hold phrase among managers . In a subsequent report , released in May 2004 , McCarthy increased the long term prediction slightly to 3.4 million but said that the near term exodus over the next two to three years would be much faster than earlier predicted , with 830,000 jobs leaving by the end of 2005. // A summary of McCarthy 's predictions is included in Table 4-1 . The report predicts that the exodus of computer occupations will happen earlier and deeper than other types of jobs , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overseas include a wide range of occupations , such as architecture , accounting , engineering , information technology , and call center operators . This report and its numbers have been cited so frequently that many people believe it is a precise forecast rather than simply an educated guess . In some ways , with the amount of publicity that the Forrester report has drawn , it has become something like a road map for company managers , and may be a self fulfilling prophecy . // A flurry of other reports were issued by research firms that compete with Forrester , including A.T . Kearny , Deloitte , Gartner , and McKinsey . Gartner upped the ante by predicting that one half million , or 10 percent , of U.S. IT jobs would move offshore by the end of 2004 . Others such as Deloitte Consulting have focused their efforts on financial services firms , like Citigroup , JP Morgan Chase , and Fidelity , and they estimate that as many as 2.3 million U.S. jobs in banking and securities may move overseas . // The figures in these reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are at best educated guesses and at worst biased advocacy pieces . As with most emerging phenomena , no good forecasting models exist so no one can predict with any reasonable certainty what will happen . In fact , the reports themselves are usually rather sparse documents , devoid of methodology , with simple tables of predictions . For example , the Gartner report is only four pages long . // The other reason to be cautious is that these research firms also sell consulting services on how to move work overseas ; consequently they have a built in bias to encourage outsourcing efforts . As more work is outsourced overseas , these research firms stand to gain more business . However , these firms exert a strong influence on U.S. corporate management . They can often shape managerial strategy for an entire industry because they are believed to be on the cutting edge . Corporate managers , afraid of being left behind , may adopt a research firm s pronouncements because they have no better window on their competitors strategy . In fact , many of these same research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by forecasting ridiculously high revenue growth in Internet commerce . // The Kinds of Jobs That Are Vulnerable // Some academics and think tank fellows have identified occupations that are particularly vulnerable to offshore outsourcing . Cynthia Kroll and Ashok Deo Bardhan , from the University of California at Berkeley , have estimated that a staggering 14 million positions , or nearly one in nine of all U.S. jobs , are vulnerable to being outsourced overseas , the majority of which are back office jobs . The results of the Kroll and Deo Bardhan study are shown in Table 4-2. // Rob Atkinson , a senior fellow at the Progressive Policy Institute , a think tank established by the business friendly New Democratic wing of the Democratic party , has estimated that a similar number ( 12 million jobs ) are vulnerable . Atkinson notes that 54 percent of those jobs pay more than the median wage , which by definition means that high wage occupations are especially at risk . // Professor Martin Kenney and his colleague Rafiq Dossani have traveled numerous times since early 2003 to India , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They went to study the Business Process Outsourcing ( BPO ) phenomenon , and as a result they predict that some 700,000 customer service and corporate back office jobs will move from the United States to India by 2008. // Even architecture services are moving offshore . HLW International , a New York based architectural firm , designs office complexes for upstate New York in their facilities in Shanghai , China . The Chinese architects use videoconferencing in lieu of face to face meetings and are able to design to local building codes . And tax breaks are not enough to keep even call center positions . After getting 3.85 million in tax breaks from the state of Florida , the lure of cheaper labor spurred Capital One to shift 1,100 credit card call center jobs to India and abandon five buildings and 550,000 square feet of office space . Reuters Group shifted six of its financial reporting jobs to India in early 2004 , which it followed later in the year by cutting twenty editorial positions in the United States and Europe and hiring sixty people in India to replace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because Reuters subsequently announced it was making Bangalore the company s primary information gathering hub . It is hiring 1,500 workers in its Bangalore office , the equivalent of 10 percent of the company s total workforce . // How Outsourcing Snowballs // The financial services industry provides an interesting case of how offshore outsourcing snowballs from IT to other occupations . The industry is information intensive and has long been a cutting edge customer for IT services because of its unique set of information security needs . In a 2004 survey of forty three top financial services institutions , Deloitte Consulting found that the companies had on average increased their offshore personnel 500 percent , from 300 to 1,500 workers , between 2003 and 2004 and that 80 percent of that increase went to India . // The pace seems to be accelerating rapidly in the financial services . In fact , pent up demand in this sector is so great that many Indian IT firms now specialize in IT and BPO work , especially for financial services . Mastek , an Indian offshore outsourcer , earned 42 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent the year before . A CFO Magazine survey of 275 finance executives reveals that 64 percent of the firms that already outsource offshore are planning on increasing the number of jobs they send abroad , indicating that they are happy with the results . Also , according to the survey , 47 percent of the offshored jobs were high paying , with salaries of more than 50,000. // As companies become more comfortable with outsourcing IT over seas , they begin to see the possibility of shifting related tasks , such as loan processing . Companies that offshore are establishing facilities , building intangible knowledge on how to do business overseas , and tapping the local labor pool . It can only be expected that they will increasingly move more functions overseas . // The Number of Outsourcing Companies Is Rapidly Growing // A quick scan of news articles , press releases , and the Internet makes it abundantly clear that the number of companies announcing expansions of their overseas operations is accelerating . Lou Dobbs s Web site lists hundreds of companies that are Exporting America his phrase for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject . WashTech , a labor union established by the Communication Workers of America in Washington State , hosts the Offshore Tracker , a Web site that tracks company announcements of overseas expansions ( http : **29;957;TOOLONG ) . The Bibliography for this book gives the addresses for these and other important Web sites . // Many companies are either not hiring in the United State or are downsizing their domestic workforce . Nearly every major technology company , including Microsoft , Intel , Hewlett Packard/Compaq , Yahoo , Google , IBM , Electronic Data Systems ( EDS ) , and Computer Sciences Corporation ( CSC ) , is expanding its workforce abroad . In a bold move , Siemens , the German industrial conglomerate , announced that they were moving most of their 15,000 programming jobs from the United States and Western Europe to China , India , and Eastern Europe . Even smaller specialized engineering firms like Brecis Communications are moving all of their design verification and software development from the United States to India . The company designs advanced electronic chips for the latest Internet devices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been paying close attention to the global job shift . For instance , on June 17 , 2003 , the Economic Times of India , a leading Indian financial newspaper , announced that EDS was opening its first BPO center in India , with about 500 jobs . A company executive was quoted as saying , This is part of our best shore strategy wherein we are not only looking at India but several other countries within Asia . The very next day , the American press reported that EDS was laying off 2 percent of its workforce , or approximately 2,700 people . In fact , in March 2003 , we received inquiries from the Indian press about our thoughts concerning the coming backlash from U.S. workers , about four months before anyone in the U.S. press was thinking seriously about it . Table 4 3 shows a small sample of companies expanding their offshore workers while down sizing in America . // Government Services Are Offshored , Too // It s not only private companies that are outsourcing white collar jobs . Federal , state , and local governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are few estimates in this area , but a study showed that just about every state government has offshored at least some of its work , oftentimes unwittingly . In many cases , companies are not required to inform states if the work is being completed overseas . For example , the state of Washington determined that about 150 contracts contained at least 50 million worth of offshore outsourcing. // Government procurement is at the heart of many offshore outsourcing controversies . The issue is often framed as , Should tax dollars be used to create jobs offshore when there are so many unemployed Americans ? The outsourcing advocates argue that the answer is obviously yes because it is cheaper . However , this kind of debate only scratches the surface . // U.S. government procurement rules are complex and take into account a large array of noneconomic criteria that limit competition . For example , advanced technology work for the Defense Department is often limited to U.S. companies , such as the Navy 's supercomputer purchase from IBM , because this serves national security goals such as preserving U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is somewhat iron ic that IBM is able to present itself as a U.S. company when it means get ting billions of dollars in U.S. government contracts , but calls itself a glob al company when it wants to export jobs. ) // But nonsecurity objectives also shape the U.S. government procurement policies . For instance , many contracts are set aside for small and disadvantaged businesses ( precertified by the government ) so that only they can bid on them . The rationale is that this special treatment increases business ownership and employment in traditionally underrepresented groups . Offshore outsourcing , however , may significantly and severely distort the intended impact of such procurement regulations . U.S. firms that win U.S. government business because they have small and disadvantaged business status could turn around and perform all of that work offshore . // A Lack of Government Monitoring // Despite this growing trend toward offshore outsourcing , the U.S. government has made little effort to monitor the flow of jobs overseas . The U.S. Commerce and Labor Departments have no system for tracking the number of jobs moving overseas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In early 2004 , Congressman Frank Wolf , a long serving Republican from the Virginia suburbs of Washington , D.C. , asked the Commerce Department to study the problem . The department 's report is hampered by the paltry funds appropriated by Congress for the study ; the 335,000 was enough to do only a cursory examination of the problem and a rehash of existing data . // What is desperately needed is original data collection and research . Some people in government claim that they lack the resources to collect the data , which is remarkable considering how much the federal government spends ( 130 billion annually ) on research and development . Only a few million dollars are needed to conduct the research needed to develop a better sense of what is happening . Fortunately , there is recently passed legislation , also sponsored by Congressman Wolf , that appropriates 2 million to conduct such as study . // In the first quarter of 2004 , the Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) added two questions on offshore outsourcing and offshoring to their Mass Layoffs Statistics survey of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4,663 , or just 2 percent of the layoffs during the first quarter of 2004 , were due to companies moving work overseas , either offshoring or offshore outsourcing . The offshoring advocates were ecstatic , pointing out that the jobless recovery had nothing to do with moving work overseas . There are a few problems with using this statistic , though . //
