Dad is addicted to sleeping pills . His son is a pothead . The stepmother Mika ( Isabelle Huppert ) wanders about with a benign half-smile on her face , lacing the family 's bedtime hot chocolate with a potent  --  and in her hands potentially lethal  --  soporific . The Swiss chateau is an unlikely stoner 's paradise  --  and maybe , in Chabrol 's mind , a metaphor for the way the bourgeois sleepwalk around their problems . Merci pour le Chocolat occasionally succumbs to Mika 's legato rhythms , but it is more often a sly , subtle comedy about the oh-so-gentle art of murder .  --  By Richard Schickel
