DESIGN Headnote A young famiiy bucks tradition to make a personalized home Photograph Like an update of the Yellow Brick Road , the gallery 's terrazzo floor runs from the front door to the light-filled kitchen at the rear of the house . // Mark and Carol Lerdal 's lifestyle did n't match their surroundings . A couple with four active kids , an interest in energy conservation , and a love for all things modern , including art photography and furniture , they lived in a traditional San Francisco Edwardian-dark , with small , confined rooms . So they decided to give their house an extreme makeover . " The Lerdals wanted an open , fluid space that would bring in more light , " says architect Byron Kuth . " We also wanted to create living and play areas that were better integrated . " At its heart , the Lerdal residence is a family home . Although the rooms are sophisticated , their multifunctional materials and uses make them suited for kids and adults . A long , terrazzo-floored gallery runs the length of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors at both ends . Its walls are lined with Carol 's extensive collection of contemporary color photography , making it function as an art display . But the hall-like gallery also acts as a superhighway for kids on their way to the lower-level playroom or backyard . " The terrazzo floor is tough and durable , hides dirt , and stands up to muddy boots , " Kuth says . Photograph Above : The street front shows how the entry and living room glow at dusk , beckoning guests toward the entry and gallery . The master suite is stacked above the children 's bedrooms , and the main living spaces on the first floor open to the gallery-hall . Near left : The kitchen contains a bright breakfast area beside the back staircase . A wall of translucent glass cabinets keeps the space as open as possible . // Instead of keeping areas closed off with walls , " we differentiated spaces with materials and light , " the architect explains . " The living room , dining room , and kitchen opening off the gallery have wood floors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rooms provides another clue to how the Lerdals live . The living room is only one-third the size of the combined kitchen and dining room , since gathering informally as a family takes priority . The novel use of industrial materials-from acrylic plastic railing panels to rubber stair treads-reinforces the family-friendly approach . The overall result is a modern home that 's a true reflection of how its owners live . " The Internet has opened up a whole new world of industrial materials for residential architects , " Kuth says . " We 've been able to find materials that are tougher and less expensive than some of the usual ones used in homes . This makes a lot of sense for a family .

The - inch acrylic plastic panels are orbitally sanded , giving them a " nondirectional " finish-akin to sandblasting-that amplifies light from the skylight and makes them appear to glow . * Brightly colored wood doors ( B ) .
