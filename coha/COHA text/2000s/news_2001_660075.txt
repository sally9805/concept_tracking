<p> Shraddha Patil wakes up at 5:30 a.m . She rolls up her floor-pad bed , eats fruit or porridge , puts on a spotless uniform , ties ribbons in her hair , and starts to study . For decades the Patil family , now eight members , has lived in one room in this Bombay " chowl structure , " a moldy three-story built in the 1940s as a male dormitory for mill workers from the village . By Indian standards , the Patils are solidly lower-middle class : Shraddha 's father respools yarn in a textile mill . Her mother tapes labels on boxes in a factory . Neither parent went past seventh grade . But already their promising daughter , who likes Chinese food and dancing to Hindi film songs , is poised to pass the crucial 10th-grade exam in March . That exam holds both the key to higher study in the Indian school system , and what is increasingly difficult for the average Indian to find : a better job . For the Patils , Shraddha may be a " break-out " child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this working-class neighborhood known as Lal Bagh . She speaks of being a naval officer . Such a career normally would be far beyond the expectation of Lal Bagh 's sons , and especially its daughters . What 's changed in India in the 1990s is that such a career is no longer impossible for a 15-year-old female who applies herself . For the first time , on a large scale and for many reasons , Indian society is breaking tradition and sanctioning the upward movement of its working-class females . They , in turn , are proving to be the top-scoring students . The India best known today in the West is the India of Bombay neon and dotcom startups . It is largely an upper-middle-class India , whose offspring circulate successfully in Silicon Valley and Ivy League schools ; who in India read smart English-language magazines like " Outlook " and jet comfortably between Delhi and New York . But this India represents barely 5 percent of the world 's second-most-populous country . Shraddha Patil comes from a vast and often invisible working-class segment of India that is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social terms , this large class , hundreds of millions strong , is poised to make the largest strides in coming years - or to be the most disappointed . Whether or not this working class makes progress in coming years will be a real test of the government , which has abandoned the socialist ideals of Indian founder Jahawarlal Nehru for a " globalizing " future . Metaphors like " India Rising " and " India Unbound " pepper the phrases of Indian officials today who see India as an untapped resource for Western investment and human capital . For Shraddha , the drama is whether she can tap her own potential , while facing the ruggedly competitive conditions in a country whose population has risen from 300 million in 1960 to 1 billion today . In her immediate world , that means scoring high on the 10th-grade exam in two months . " I have to score well , " says Shraddha . " How else can I get out of this ? " she says , stretching her arms out to the walls of the small flat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the working-class urban kids who are going to bring the broadest changes , " says Sudipta Dhruva , a leading Bombay educational consultant who works with adolescent girls and street children . " Girls like Shraddha will make the biggest impact . They have the potential and the possibility of making something of themselves . " Certainly the Patil family is putting its entire support and hopes behind the daughter . They have gone into debt to give Shraddha after-school coaching classes . They allow her to forgo her chores at home in order to study . They will let her wait as late as age 25 to marry ( her mother was married at 16 ) . She is fortunate to have four strong women - mom , two unmarried aunts , and maternal grandmother - urging her on . Its OK now to marry at age 25 Shraddha also benefits from the development of new attitudes about females in India . Partly , this shift is due to a calculation that an educated girl is a better match for a more financially secure groom . Partly it is due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband and wife must work to make ends meet . But the change in India is also due to a still-permeating awareness that old attitudes of male " ownership " of women , or a sanctioning of the neglect of girls , is no longer quite right or acceptable , experts say . In the 1990s , world forums like the UN Population Summit in Cairo , the UN Copenhagen Declaration of 1995 , which used a vocabulary of " empowerment " for women , and the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995 laid down public rhetorical markers for female equality . Small women 's advocacy groups in India , often pooh-poohed by local and even national politicians , have proven tough beyond their numbers in using such international declarations to prick the conscience of the majority . " Things are not as they were , " says Shraddha 's grandmother , who grew up in British-ruled Karnataka state , and who never went to school , since it required a two-hour walk over a mountain . " Girls are now fearless ; they are able to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would only go out with a chaperone . Shraddha 's mother was always accompanied , " she says , nodding at her daughter . Still , those familiar with Shraddha 's situation say it is quite touch and go as to whether she can escape the gravitational pull of her world . English , the official language of government , is still a foreign tongue in this neighborhood . Few in Lal Bagh can afford cable TV . Their children have little access to the new cultural idioms , ideas , and styles that have been so quickly adopted by upper-middle-class Indian students . Few of the popular new Indian TV sitcoms , dramas , and soap operas , for that matter , are set in one-room apartments . Shraddha knows who Ricky Martin is , and she can identify various continents on a map . But there is little " picture " in her mind of the India beyond Bombay . She has no disposable income ; she can not swap or buy pirated CDs , or even dream of saving for a laptop computer . Her parents have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or what questions to ask about pushing a naval career . Moreover , Shraddha 's grades average about 68 percent , and she needs to score well above 70 to enter a class that will prepare her for a future in civil service . If her studies slump , if she is distracted even for a month , or if she does not find good guidance - she could easily settle down into a marriage and a life that is more familiar to previous generations of Indian women . She could become , like many in Lal Bagh , someone who has been exposed to physics and trigonometry , but who today drives a bus or sells fabric . Still , India is a " land of extremes , " to quote an old cliche . And Shraddha 's case dramatizes its truth . The Patils live in a single room , but their standard of living is better than probably 70 percent of the Indian populace . The Patil family could " sell " their room for 150,000 rupees ( about $ 3,400 ) . They are not scraping by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or on illegal land . Their Lal Bagh neighborhood has a history of strong unionism and family loyalty . The kids from the five chowl structures in this area all play cricket in a lighted field out front . There are four sources of income for the Patils pulling in about 8,000 rupees a month . With a grandmother in the house - who is invariably frying fish , chopping garlic , or grating coconut on the floor - they eat well . Educationally , Shraddha ( who on a recent afternoon was studying how to identify phosphorus gas ) is also far beyond more than half of India 's children who , according to World Bank studies , never make it to first grade . Nor is Shraddha enrolled in a " municipal school " as her father was . Such schools are largely dysfunctional - lacking books , teachers , discipline , attendance , and often electricity . Yet if India is a land of extremes , it is also famously a land of contradictions . The hard truth in Indian working-class life today is that just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem more difficult to find . " Working-class girls struggle harder because they are more realistic about their prospects , " says Dr. Anil Sadgopal , dean of Delhi University School of Education . " In the 1980s when we were in college , no one ever worried about getting a job , " says Shraddha 's math teacher . " Today when we advertise for a teacher , we get hundreds of applicants . " Where 's the high tech ? Given India 's enthusiastic embrace of high tech , and the expectations about jobs for students in the computer industry , it is notable that no serious computer training is offered at Sridokhar School , where Shraddha studies . She is not sure how to make an Internet connection . A computer room holds about a dozen machines , which one teacher confides were donated as a political favor after several low-scoring kids with connections were admitted to the school . More tellingly , perhaps , are the number of Sridokhar students who go on to study at Indian IITs ( India Information Techs ) - the much-touted seedbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many students have gone from Sridokhar to an IIT , Principal S.S. Pathak seemed a little stunned by the question , as if he were being asked about the geography of Neptune . " No , " he finally said . " We 've never had a graduate like that . " At the end of a long day of school and coaching class , Shraddha returns to the Patils ' apartment . The lights on the cricket field glow warmly outside . Shraddha 's grandmother , and her mother - just back from the factory job she took to support her daughter - welcome her . They all smile . Her aunt gazes with pride as Shraddha describes how to calculate the volume of various shapes . Goldfish in a tiny window aquarium circle languidly . Later , Shraddha might catch a little TV ; a Hindi film is showing . Tomorrow will be soon enough to think about the obstacles between her and a life as an Indian naval officer . Shraddha 's schedule 5:30 a.m . Rise and shine 7 to 1 p.m . School , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day 's classwork 4 to 5 p.m . An hour for relaxing 5 to 6:30 Head to coaching classes for math study 6:30 to 9:00 p.m . Go to study hall 9 p.m . Head home Cramming for the big exam The latest educational phenomenon at all levels of society , coaching classes are seen as indispensable for passing the 10th-grade exam . The test is so important that during the past four years Shraddha 's family has borrowed some 25,000 rupees , or three months ' salary , to pay for it . The Patils are well aware of an open secret : About 20 percent of the math and science questions on the test will not be answerable without outside study . Technically , the material is part of the national curriculum . But many students , parents , and teachers confide that higher-level questions are either not in the books , or not covered in the course of the normal school day . After coaching class , Shraddha walks to a study hall provided by the city that costs 75 rupees ( $ 1.60 ) a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In some parts of Bombay , before exam time , the city sets up tables where barefoot students study under streetlights . Shraddha is more fortunate . By 9 p.m. the study hall closes and Shraddha walks home . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2001 . The Christian Science Publishing Society
