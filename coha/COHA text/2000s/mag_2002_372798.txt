Everyone is caught up in the blame game . But nobody talks much about the fact that the now-famous Phoenix FBI memo , which warned last July that terrorists might be studying in American flight schools , is hardly unusual . The memo raised the possibility of attacks similar to what occurred . But reams of other , equally plausible memos  --  written before and after 9/11  --  are in the files as well . A constant stream of theories and proposals comes from FBI field offices to the bureau 's headquarters in Washington . We agents see things we think are worth a closer look . We recommend opening a case . We recommend a wiretap , an undercover operation or around-the-clock surveillance . But all proposals need to be reviewed for legality , practicality and the potential of public backlash . <P> If the Holland Tunnel in New York City imploded from a terrorist attack tomorrow , you could then find official memos about the vulnerability of that tunnel . Convicted terrorists are in prison now for conspiring to take it out . But that does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Muslims who drive through it every day . <P> The Phoenix memo 's main proposal  --  a nationwide sweep of flight schools in search of al-Qaeda terrorists  --  now appears to be solid and rational . But if I had been a unit chief at FBI headquarters reading it last summer , my first thought would have been that such a sweep would lead to a massive hue and cry over " profiling " of Muslims . I would have been disinclined to push the memo upstairs . To justify such a sweep would have required far more than knowing that bin Laden was possibly trying to hijack a plane . <P> Politicians and the media are talking about a failure to connect the dots , and the FBI and CIA can do more to share information with each other and local police . ( Since 9/11 , the bureau has been sharing raw reports just so it is not accused of holding anything back . ) But I have not seen any pre-9/11 dots that could have been connected , at least with the FBI operating under current laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the requirements for due process , then there is a lot more the FBI and police could do . But does the country want to go there ? <P> I do n't think so . The public expects FBI agents to use instinct to surgically extract terrorists from society  --  and to do it without inconveniencing the public or infringing on innocent lives . Americans have unrealistic expectations about what law enforcement can do in a society in which personal freedom is deemed more important than public safety . Americans say they will give anything to be safe from terrorists . They do n't really mean it . They would rather live in a free society than be completely safe . That means some dots wo n't ever be connected . <P> The agent , a veteran of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , asked to remain anonymous
