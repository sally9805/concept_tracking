<p> WASHINGTON  --  Three years after the U.S.-led invasion , the war in Iraq is dominating George W. Bush 's presidency and defining his legacy . <p> As surely as Franklin Roosevelt is remembered most for his leadership during World War II and Lyndon Johnson for Vietnam , presidential scholars and some of Bush 's own advisers predict that history will judge Bush by his decision to order a pre-emptive attack on Iraq on March 19 , 2003 , and by the long-term consequences of America 's first war of the 21st century . <p> His signature No Child Left Behind education bill ? Overshadowed . Individual investment accounts in Social Security ? Beaten back . Tax simplification ? Shelved . The " compassionate conservative " he described in 2000 ? Replaced by a wartime president arguing the need to stay the course in a conflict that has lasted longer and cost more than most Americans imagined when it began . <p> " They were expecting to move on to a bunch of other things in the second term like Social Security reform and the ' ownership society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Iraq , " says political scientist Steven Schier , author of High Risk and Big Ambition : The Presidency of George W. Bush . " It 's the whale in the bathtub for the administration . " <p> Nearly two-thirds of Americans say the Iraq war will be what Bush is most remembered for , according to a USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup Poll taken Friday through Sunday . Just 18% cite the president 's efforts against terrorism , 10% his response to Hurricane Katrina , 5% his Supreme Court appointments . Tax cuts , the hallmark of his first year in office , were chosen by 2% <p> The invasion of Iraq has shaped not only what the president has done in office  --  including policies he hopes will spark democracy across the Arab world  --  but also what he 's been unable to do because of the war 's demands . It has jeopardized his hopes of forging an enduring Republican majority . <p> " There 's no question the president 's legacy will be dominated by Iraq , " says Mark McKinnon , a top adviser in Bush 's presidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in government . " <p> Consider : <p> *Bush 's job-approval rating in the USA TODAY Poll has declined in almost perfect tandem with falling support for the war , overwhelming the boost he might have expected from relatively optimistic views of the economy . In the new poll , his standing sank to a record low , 36% . <p> *That erosion and the focus on the war have cost him political clout on other fronts , from creating health savings accounts to facing congressional opposition to the Dubai ports deal . <p> *The financial bill for the war  --  now running nearly $6 billion a month  --  has limited the administration 's options on seeking more tax cuts and cutting the deficit . <p> When the war began , 69% of those surveyed said the United States was " certain " to win in Iraq ; an additional 25% said victory was likely . No more : In the new poll , four in 10 predict the United States is likely or certain to lose . <p> On Monday , Bush delivered the first of several speeches to mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I wish I could tell you that the violence is waning and that the road ahead will be smooth , " he said in an address at George Washington University . " It will not . " He asked for patience and vowed resolve . <p> History 's judgment <p> Supporters note that history 's judgment will wait for the conflict 's outcome and its long-term repercussions  --  something that may not be known for decades . <p> " We 're in the middle of a struggle that is not fated " to end one way or the other , says David Frum , a former White House speechwriter for Bush . " Depending on whether America does or does not succeed , the president will be judged accordingly . I know many people speak very harshly about him right now . I think that the final judgment is going to be from the result . " <p> At the moment , efforts to form a broad-based government in Iraq are struggling , and sectarian conflict between Sunni Arabs and Shiites has become a bigger threat than the insurgency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commander in the Middle East . A full-fledged civil war would multiply the perils for the U.S. mission . More than 2,300 U.S. troops have died in the Iraq war . <p> Bush 's allies compare him to Harry Truman , unpopular during much of his tenure but highly regarded in retrospect . Bush 's critics compare him instead to Johnson , a fellow Texan whose presidency was engulfed by the Vietnam War . <p> " It 's going to take us a while to figure out whether Iraq in the long term is a plus or minus for us , " Schier says . " Is it Vietnam or something much more successful ? " How wise will the doctrine of pre-emption turn out to be ? And , in the end , will the war spread democracy or instability ? <p> The lesson from Truman and Johnson : Wars trump almost everything else . Efforts to do other big things often are overtaken by the demands and controversies of war . Since the United States was founded , it has been involved in only four wars longer than this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Korean conflict and Vietnam . <p> " War kills reform , " says Robert Dallek , an LBJ biographer and author of Hail to the Chief : The Making and Unmaking of American Presidents . " It consumes the energy of the administration , the public , the press . This is what the focus is on . " <p> The Spanish-American War curtailed a populist wave . The Progressive Movement ended when World War I began . When the United States entered World War II , FDR told Americans that " Dr. New Deal " had been replaced by " Dr. Win-the-War . " The Korean War stalled Truman 's Fair Deal . Vietnam overshadowed the Great Society . <p> For Bush , the attacks on Sept. 11 , 2001 , transformed a presidency that had been focused on domestic affairs into one consumed by concerns about international terrorism . The invasion of Afghanistan a month later to oust the Taliban regime , which had sheltered al-Qaeda terrorists , commanded broad foreign and domestic support . <p> The decision to invade Iraq was far more controversial . Within months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war a mistake ; now 57% do . An American public that had united in the wake of 9/11 divided over the attack on Iraq , and that split has hardened . While seven of 10 Republicans now say sending troops was n't a mistake , eight of 10 Democrats say it was . So do six of 10 independents . <p> Bush 's top strategist , Karl Rove , talked expansively in 2000 about building a durable GOP majority akin to the one William McKinley forged in 1896 ; it prevailed until the Great Depression of 1929 . The divisions over the Iraq war have made that a more distant prospect . <p> Some GOP successes <p> Republicans have scored political successes . Bush is only the 15th president to win a second term . Since he has been in the White House , the GOP has gained five seats in the Senate and 10 in the House . Still , the proportion of Americans who describe themselves as Republican , now 32% , has n't changed since Bush 's first inauguration . His approval rating among independents , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The elections in November will test the public 's views of Bush and the war . " The president is always somewhere on the horizon in any midterm election , and in this one it might very well be more than the usual referendum on the president , " says Mickey Edwards , a former Oklahoma congressman and member of the House Republican leadership . " Bush could be a heavy shadow in this election . " <p> New York Sen. Charles Schumer , chairman of the Democrats ' Senate campaign committee , says Iraq has become " a metaphor " damaging to Bush : Concerns about the administration 's competence were raised by the war , ignited by the faltering response to Katrina and reinforced by the maladroit handling of the controversy over a Dubai-owned company taking over some cargo operations at several U.S. ports . <p> A majority of Americans continues to view the president as a strong leader , and most approve of his handling of terrorism . By nearly 2-1 , however , they disapprove of his handling of the war . Most say the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asserting that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction . <p> The repercussions of that judgment doomed initiatives closer to home , according to Michael Tanner of the libertarian Cato Institute , a White House ally on its proposed Social Security overhaul . In the State of the Union address in 2005 , Bush called that the top domestic priority of his second term . <p> " For those of us out in the field , we could tell support for the idea of personal accounts declined with the president 's rating , " Tanner says . " Particularly as we went through last year , and the war was going badly and the disapproval of Bush was ratcheting up , it had a significant impact . " The trouble was n't that Bush failed to stump for his plan , Tanner says . The problem was convincing skeptics to try a controversial approach that had been sketched in broad strokes . " He said ' Trust me , ' " Tanner says . " People said , ' No , we do n't . ' " <p> The setback on Social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax-simplification plan drawn up by a bipartisan commission he appointed , according to the panel 's co-chairman , former senator John Breaux . Bush had spent much of his political capital already , and the White House was finding it " hard to juggle all the balls in the air at the same time , " the Louisiana Democrat says . <p> Breaux argues that tax reform could have been a unifying achievement for Bush . Now , he says , Iraq is " going to be the first line in the history books : He got tied up in a war that was very difficult to get out of . " <p> Bush seems to be thinking about the history books , too . When conservative commentator Fred Barnes interviewed the president last summer for his book Rebel-in-Chief , Bush noted he had read three new books analyzing the first president 's place in history . " He said , ' Even after 200 years , they 're still reassessing George Washington , ' " Barnes recalls . " ' What will they say about me ?
