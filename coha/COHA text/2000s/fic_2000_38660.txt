A Picture of Time <p> You say there 's no time like the present . But what is the present here ? I 've watched TV for ages and seen movies since I was three . TV 's daily life and movies are a communal fantasy . Today is in color , yesterday 's in black and white , and there 's no agreement about tomorrow . <p> I hear music everywhere , and then there are voices . Everyone 's speaking in a flow and rush of language , the words are like water . There are echoes , too . And I know the whispering wo n't stop . It 's the past . Time passes on and fools us by living underneath the surface . <p> You say there 's a reality we all exist in , and I say I wo n't agree to it . You become red , enraged , and I make something from that . Red becomes an opening , surprising you . But I put it in the corners , where its brilliance is held in suspension . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I keep it , like dreams and wishes , for myself . <p> I suppose it 's obvious . I 'm always fighting time . It 's relentless in its mission , and I 'm nothing to it . But there 's no time in dreams , which is why I need them . There 's protracted suspense , the ragged drama of discontent and tempestuous wishes . And morose blue may suddenly pop up , disguised as threat , to announce the predatory present . I may be able to appease it , the blues , if I can find a place to put it . Even in dreams I want to control sadness and danger . I surround and contain them , and later everything catches up with me . <p> You say take hold of yourself . I hold on to dear , difficult life and keep track of success and failure-and loss , the holes and emptinesses where I could fall off and forget the world . Oases and shelters beckon , tempting illusions wrapped in bars and stripes . I reach them and take the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moves on without my consent . I should have known better . My schemes might be planted next to startling green thoughts and in earthy , black fields . If I 'm lucky , the dark is rich and compassionate and will let me rest for a while . Something good might come along . <p> Is it judgment I 'm awaiting or merry ? I do n't know . I draw a broad line around myself and make a fortress against inevitability . Suddenly there 's static , an impish , contentious energy I never expect . It disrupts connections , compelling me to assimilate forces I do n't fully comprehend . Like electricity , which I 've never stopped relying upon . I know it was discovered and had to be captured , even subdued . Yet it was always there , and it probably was n't waiting , the way I am . <p> You 're naked , you say . Protect yourself . I cover myself in shame , lust , and greed , smearing and hiding the humiliating marks of battle . I 've done this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You say no one can escape , and I run down a narrow , single-minded trail . I burrow deep and throw on another layer , for warmth or as a palliative . I grow big and orange . Fire is more orange than red and , like anger , throws off more heat than light . When it dies , there are embers and ash , wan reminders of its glory . The sky becomes night and swallows everything . The night is a thrilling action figure in the human theater . I hide in the dark . <p> You say I ca n't fight the inevitable . But what else is there to fight ? I arrive at my destination and tremble at reason 's door . It 's inviting to enter , seductive , but there 's really not enough room . Still I 've learned I ca n't be an exception and walk in through the back door . To outfox reason 's complacency , I escort the unpredictable unconscious . As usual no one notices . Later , perpetually , everyone 's surprised . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irrationality . I bet on what we ca n't know , which wrestles with everyone 's limits and confounds certainty . It usually claims victory , and tonight I win easily . There was more behind the scenes than we ever appreciated . You 're sorry to lose , and I console you . But the truth is I applaud the victory and prefer it to reason 's insensible claims . Like the one that says time heals all wounds . Time 's no cure , no doctor . You and I go on . We continue somehow , and our persistence is the source of everything we make . I want to surrender , but I ca n't , and I live in that paradox , and so do you . <p>
