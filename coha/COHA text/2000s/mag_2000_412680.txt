Ken Tucker discusses how Survivor and Big Brother are struggling to keep it real with unguarded portrayals of modern black men . Photograph BLACK BOX ( 1 ) Peterson , ( 2 ) Underwood , ( 3 ) Hines , ( 4 ) The PJs , ( 5 ) Collins , and ( Ii ) Cosby // WHAT A DIFFERENCE a season makes . Before this past summer , the biggest question regarding race on TV was whether CBS ' low-rated hospital drama City of Angels was failing because Americans did n't want to watch a primarily black cast or because it was just an erratic drama . The icy stoicism that paralyzes the performance of Angels ' Blair Underwood is merely the serious version of what Gregory Hines does as Will 's boss on Will &; Grace and what Steve Harvey does as a schoolteacher on The Steve Harvey Show . Hines and Harvey play up the jiving coolness of their authority-figure characters to emphasize the novelty of black men in positions of power on television . Bill Cosby , at the height of his popularity on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if he too often experienced adulation from many of his white fans as a form of condescension-which , in many cases , it probably was . But this summer , with the pervasive prime-time appearances of two nonactors-Gervase Peterson on Survivor and William Collins , a.k.a . " Will Mega " on Big Brother-we witnessed black men whose complexities and conflicted behavior would never be permitted on a conventional drama or sitcom . At a time when no scripted show , for example , would ever allow a black character to be depicted as lazy ( or " shiftless , " in more traditional racist nomenclature ) , Gervase 's fellow survivors felt free to castigate him for not doing enough work in the most bitterly frank terms . The G-man told The Early Show host Bryant Gumbel that he 'd " planned to do as little work as possible , be friends with everybody , coast through , and win . " Gervase cultivated as much of a laid-back persona as one can while subsisting on rice , as well as weathering the seething anger and lush green envy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Collins , confined to the Motel 6 From Hell with Julie Chen as its chattering chambermaid , made it clear he was one brother the Big producers were not going to manipulate before he was done doing some manipulating of his own . His very first day in the BB house , Collins voiced his most pressing , media-savvy concern : " Me bein " long-winded , how am I gon na get some airtime ? " Surrounded by roommates intent on inoffensiveness , Collins proclaimed , " We 're here to confront our fears . " He wanted to talk about race relations and religious faith , and when the Brother-ites expressed discomfort with such topics , Collins both explained the reason for his insistence- " The only things I have are my principles , my raison d'etre " - and dismissed their reticence for the social squeamishness it was : " You 're all a bunch of softies . " News broke toward the end of Collins ' BB stay that , under the name Hiram Ashantee , he was a member of the New Black Panther Party , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Jews and whites . It 's too bad that many of Collins ' subsequently broadcast remarks to his housemates ( who remained unaware of his political affiliation ) were not scrutinized for their content but merely for that affiliation . Meanwhile , Collins was insisting , " I do n't want to be known as the superhero for black rights on this show , " yet that 's how the " houseguests , " in deeming him arrogant , stereotyped him . ( Brother 's other black occupant , Cassandra , shrewdly remarked to William , " Your body language is intimidating .... You have so much power " - that is , a power to provoke . ) In a 1969 essay on black power , the critic Seymour Kim wrote that " art is not enough unless it becomes a revolutionary weapon that will affect society in just about the same way that a bomb will . " Substitute the word " TV " for " art " and you 'll know how Collins felt , and why he was doomed to be disappointed by the level of discourse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed , the debates that Collins prompted proved to be the most stimulating moments on this show , which degenerated into staring-at-the-walls banality the instant he was voted out . Given a television landscape in which , on any given week , the most wellrounded images of black men may be the underrated cartoon characters of Eddie Murphy 's The PJs and David Letterman 's stage manager Biff Henderson ( no flunky , he enhances Dave 's man-on-the-street stunts with his own good-natured but firm irony ) , I do n't want to hear TV sitcom and drama writers whining about how the reality-show craze is robbing viewers of vivid characterizations . Let 's see if the writers for The Hughleys , on which Gervase is scheduled to make a guest appearance , can come up with an image any more comic and pointed than the black T-shirt emblazoned with a bulls ' ' - eye on one side and the word target on the other that Peterson devised for himself his last night on that island . <p>              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
