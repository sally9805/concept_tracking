<p> Harry Potter is growing up . <p> Not just Daniel Radcliffe and his boy wizard , both of whom are older and wiser in the second installment , Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets , which opens today . But the franchise itself is maturing . The planned series of seven , based on the J.K. Rowling best sellers , is gradually creating a magic all its own . <p> Secrets ' predecessor , Harry Potter and the Sorcerer 's Stone , was the event of the season last year . It went on to become the top-grossing film of 2001 , taking in $ 318 million in North America and landing behind only Titanic in all-time gross . But many critics and some moviegoers thought it a bit tedious and lacking in humor and imaginative fancy , largely because filmmakers were so faithful to the letter of the book . <p> Though this one is n't expected to do as well at the box office as the first movie ( sequels rarely do ) , the film reflects a confidence that could win over reluctant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years to come . <p> " You do n't need to sell $ 900 million worth of tickets to be a huge success , " says Seth Siegel , co-founder and licensing chairman of The Beanstalk Group , the world 's largest trademark licensing company . " Whether it 's a little more or a little less than the first time , it ca n't do anything but enormous numbers . The franchise is very , very healthy and moving forward . " <p> Advance ticket sales " are on par with last year 's , maybe even a little better , " says Robert Bucksbaum , president of Reel Source Inc. , which tracks box office sales . <p> In this installment , the bespectacled wizard hero is 12 , in his second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry , and facing his biggest challenge yet : identifying and fighting a dark magic that could take over the academy . His closest pals , Ron Weasley ( Rupert Grint ) and Hermione Granger ( Emma Watson ) , and his archenemy , Draco Malfoy ( Tom Felton ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are some distinctive new faces as well , notably Kenneth Branagh as the comically self-absorbed Gilderoy Lockhart and Jason Isaacs as the slyly villainous Lucius Malfoy . <p> But for this movie , the book became less gospel , more guide , in part because the success of the first movie bolstered director Chris Columbus ' ability to be bold . <p> * Stone was nearly an hour longer than most family films ( 2 hours , 31 minutes ) , and industry watchers fretted that kids could n't sit still that long . Instead , some fans complained that the movie was too short . This time , they might be satisfied : Secrets runs 10 minutes longer . <p> * Stone was thought to be too scary for children , another fear that proved unfounded . This time , there are even darker moments : Harry hears creepy voices that no one else can pick up and finds frightening messages written in blood . As a class assignment , he and his pals must repot ( and later slice ) shrieking mandrake plants that look like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ron are nearly squashed to death by a killer tree known as the whomping willow and are attacked by swarms of giant spiders . <p> The underlying themes are darker , too , and more serious . Where Stone narrowly drew on the differences between the world of wizards and the non-magical world of muggles , Secrets emphasizes the evils of racism . There is an effort underway , led mostly by the cruel Lucius Malfoy and his bully son , Draco , to purify the wizarding world of muggles ( humans ) and mudbloods ( wizards with some human ancestors ) . By exploring a kind of ethnic cleansing within a wizardly setting , the movie presents a lesson in tolerance . <p> " Lucius believes his own race is superior , " says English actor Jason Isaacs , who plays the despicable character . " You do n't need to go back in time to Hitler . There are plenty of people getting elected all over that are terrified of change . There are the recent anti-asylum and anti-immigration movements that political parties seem to be acting on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running around with a pillowcase on his head . " <p> But it 's not all scary morality tale . Secrets also offers more laughs , and characters are better developed . Both filmmakers and actors display a greater assurance with the material . <p> Radcliffe himself noticed the difference : " I am much more confident with the filmmaking process and would often discuss ideas with Chris Columbus , which I would not have a year ago . The atmosphere was more relaxed because we knew each other very well and felt comfortable in the world . " <p> Says Columbus : " Dan 's an incredibly bright , serious person , and he has taken the time to work on his craft day after day for two years , so he 's really become much more professional . All the kids were more confident in their performing . " <p> In the first movie , the initial 45 minutes dealt mostly with exposition and introduction of the characters . Secrets is more of an action film , and newcomers  --  especially Branagh 's narcissistic Lockhart  --  are fully formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added their own touches to the story . Lucius , for example , mistreats his son , Draco , which shows the origins and motivations behind the boy 's bullying behavior . <p> And Columbus suggested that Radcliffe deliver one line in the subtly swaggering style of a young Clint Eastwood rather than the less dramatic verbal confrontation in the book . After Lucius says sarcastically , " Let 's hope Mr. Potter is always around to save the day , " Radcliffe asserts , " Do n't worry . I will be . " <p> The sequel also sets up the audience , ever so subtly , for the third Potter movie with a reference to Azkaban prison . That film  --  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban , which starts shooting in March  --  will again likely be dark and frightening . Towering demonic presences known as dementors menace Harry , " draining peace , hope and happiness out of the air around them . " But , on a lighter note , the remedy for their efforts is chocolate . ( Raisinets tie-in , anyone ? ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the series : <p> * Replacing a key character . Septuagenarian Richard Harris , who played Hogwarts ' wise headmaster , Albus Dumbledore , died just weeks ago . ( A stand-in is said to have taken his place on days he was too sick to work . ) A rumored front-runner to take over the role is said to be Christopher Lee , most recently seen in Star Wars , Episode II : Attack of the Clones and a villain in the upcoming The Lord of the Rings : The Two Towers . But matching Harris ' spirit will be difficult . <p> " The kids were very shocked at his death , " Branagh says . " They loved him . The line between fiction and reality was rather blurred in their relationship . When they were around him on set , he was like a compassionate , wise old uncle . They all felt really safe around him . He had a kindly presence . " <p> * Bringing on a new director . Alfonso Cuaron ( A Little Princess , Y Tu Mama Tambien ) takes over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The kids will be 14 , and producer David Heyman has said Cuaron 's ability to direct teenagers as exhibited in Tu Mama shows " that he knows what that intense time is like . " But Columbus has been fiercely protective of the children , believing that kids still need to be kids . <p> * Spreading release dates . The third movie is scheduled for summer 2004 instead of next November . Columbus says more time is needed to accommodate the complex story and acquaint Cuaron with the material . That shift could harm the momentum gained by opening Stone and Secrets just a year apart and at the start of the popular holiday filmgoing season . And the dark , magical world seems less suited to summer , when lighter fare dominates . <p> * Waiting for the book . Secrets hits theaters more than two years since the last Potter novel , Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire , reached bookstores . The existing Potter quartet ( though still on best-seller lists ) has had some heavyweight competition from books such as Lemony Snicket 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie and possibly spurring its own franchise . Rowling 's long-awaited fifth book , Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix , is scheduled for publication next year . It reportedly is even longer than Goblet of Fire , which was a weighty 742 pages . Rowling recently said she is just weeks away from finishing , but there are those who believe she might never write the last two . <p> * Passing of time . The young stars could outgrow their roles by the fourth movie . " Temperamentally , I think they would continue , " Branagh says . " But time may catch up . Maybe they 'll just get too big or their physical growth will outstrip the characters . " <p> In the meantime , the kids are clearly still enjoying , even marveling over , their stardom . <p> " The oddest thing was seeing myself as a Lego action figure , " Radcliffe says . " It was so strange seeing my cylindrical head .
