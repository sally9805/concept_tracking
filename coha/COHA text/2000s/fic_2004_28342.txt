ONE Atlanta , Georgia Tuesday , May 6 , the present , 10:35 a.m . Judge Rachel Cutler glanced over the top of her tortoiseshell glasses . The lawyer had said it again , and this time she was n't going to let the comment drop . " Excuse me , counselor . " " I said the defendant moves for a mistrial . " " No . Before that . What did you say ? " " I said , ' Yes , sir . ' " " If you have n't noticed , I 'm not a sir . " " Quite correct , Your Honor . I apologize . " " You 've done that four times this morning . I made a note each time . " The lawyer shrugged . " It seems such a trivial matter . Why would Your Honor take the time to note my simple slip of the tongue ? " The impertinent bastard even smiled . She sat erect in her chair and glared down at him . But she immediately realized what T. Marcus Nettles was doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on trial for aggravated assault , Judge . Yet the court seems more concerned with how I address you than with the issue of police misconduct . " She glanced over at the jury , then at the other counsel table . The Fulton County assistant district attorney sat impassive , apparently pleased that her opponent was digging his own grave . Obviously , the young lawyer did n't grasp what Nettles was attempting . But she did . " You 're absolutely right , counselor . It is a trivial matter . Proceed . " She sat back in her chair and noticed the momentary look of annoyance on Nettles 's face . An expression that a hunter might give when his shot missed the mark . " What of my motion for mistrial ? " Nettles asked . " Denied . Move on . Continue with your summation . " Rachelwatched the jury foreman as he stood and pronounced a guilty verdict . Deliberations had taken only twenty minutes . " Your Honor , " Nettles said , coming to his feet . " I move for a presentence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I move that sentencing be delayed . " " Denied . " Nettles seemed to sense the mistake he 'd made earlier . " I move for the court to recuse itself . " " On what grounds ? " " Bias . " " To whom or what ? " " To myself and my client . " " Explain . " " The court has shown prejudice . " " How ? " " With that display this morning about my inadvertent use of sir . " " As I recall , counselor , I admitted it was a trivial matter . " " Yes , you did . But our conversation occurred with the jury present , and the damage was done . " " I do n't recall an objection or a motion for mistrial concerning the conversation . " Nettles said nothing . She looked over at the assistant DA . " What 's the State 's position ? " " The State opposes the motion . The court has been fair . " She almost smiled . At least the young lawyer knew the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stared at the defendant , a young white male with scraggly hair and a pockmarked face . " The defendant shall rise . " He did . " Barry King , you 've been found guilty of the crime of aggravated assault . This court hereby remands you to the Department of Corrections for a period of twenty years . The bailiff will take the defendant into custody . " She rose and stepped toward an oak-paneled door that led to her chambers . " Mr. Nettles , could I see you a moment ? " The assistant DA headed toward her , too . " Alone . " Nettles left his client , who was being cuffed , and followed her into the office . " Close the door , please . " She unzipped her robe but did not remove it . She stepped behind her desk . " Nice try , counselor . " " Which one ? " " Earlier , when you thought that jab about sir and ma'am would set me off . You were getting your butt chapped with that half-cocked defense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mistrial . " He shrugged . " You got ta do what you got ta do . " " What you have to do is show respect for the court and not call a female judge sir . Yet you kept on . Deliberately . " " You just sentenced my guy to twenty years without the benefit of a presentence hearing . If that is n't prejudice , what is ? " She sat down and did not offer the lawyer a seat . " I did n't need a hearing . I sentenced King to aggravated battery two years ago . Six months in , six months ' probation . I remember . This time he took a baseball bat and fractured a man 's skull . He 's used up what little patience I have . " " You should have recused yourself . All that information clouded your judgment . " " Really ? That presentence investigation you 're screaming for would have revealed all that , anyway . I simply saved you the trouble of waiting for the inevitable . " " You 're a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a hundred dollars . Payable now . Along with another hundred for the stunt in the courtroom . " " I 'm entitled to a hearing before you find me in contempt . " " True . But you do n't want that . It 'll do nothing for that chauvinistic image you go out of your way to portray . " He said nothing , and she could feel the fire building . Nettles was a heavyset , jowled man with a reputation for tenacity , surely unaccustomed to taking orders from a woman . " And every time you show off that big ass of yours in my court , it 's going to cost you a hundred dollars . " He stepped toward the desk and withdrew a wad of money , peeling off two one-hundred-dollar bills , crisp new ones with the swollen Ben Franklin . He slapped both on the desk , then unfolded three more . " Fuck you . " One bill dropped . " Fuck you . " The second bill fell . " Fuck you . " The third Ben Franklin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
