<p> LAKEWOOD - The year-old Walden Family Playhouse has made a name for itself by creating nine original musical adaptations of literary classics . <p> It is also quickly becoming known for rolling rockers over into Beethovens . <p> Gary Pozner , synthesizer and keyboard guru on the Tom Tom Club 's popular party album , ' Boom Boom Chi Boom Boom , ' has composed the music and lyrics for Walden 's ' Nautilus : 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea , ' which opens for previews Wednesday . <p> Pozner joins Billy Straus , an engineer on Bruce Springsteen 's seminal ' Born in the USA ' album ; and Erik Della Penna , who has written and performed with Natalie Merchant and Joan Osborne , in making their theatrical debuts with the Lakewood playhouse . Straus scored ' Rock Odyssey , ' and Della Penna wrote ' Toby and the Big Top ' and the upcoming ' Kitty Hawk . ' <p> Walden is n't trying to turn these rockers into writers of traditional musical theater . It is trying to turn traditional musical theater upside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has no traditional musical theater influences at all , ' Pozner said , ' if only because I do n't know musical theater at all . ' <p> Walden producing artistic director Douglas Love said his mission is to create a unique voice in family theater by partnering with contemporary composers who can bring signature sounds to his source materials . <p> ' We want the music to resonate with the kids in our audience but we also want it to be entertaining and relevant for their parents as well , ' Love said . ' When I was creating children 's television for Disney ( ' Out of the Box ' ) and HBO ( ' Jammin ' Animals ' ) , I did n't go the ' Barney ' route . I created songs for kids that parents would n't go crazy listening to over and over again . That 's what we are going for here , too . ' <p> Pozner is best-known for his Tom Tom Club tomfoolery , which in 1988 brought together Jerry Harrison , Chris Frantz , Tina Weymouth and , briefly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Club 's well-received third record . A tour with the Grateful Dead , Keith Richards and U2 followed . <p> Pozner 's 13-song ' Nautilus ' score is peppered with original soundscapes , such as ' Ice Music , ' that incorporate world genres , including funk , reggae and African . But it has plenty of ballads to satisfy the musical-theater fan ( ' No Man Is an Island ' ) , a fact he attributes to the king of ' Crocodile Rock . ' <p> ' I would describe the score as my early Elton John period , ' Pozner said . ' He was one of my heroes , but I would also cite Jane Siberry , who is probably the greatest songwriter of modern times . ' <p> Siberry , who wrote ' Calling All Angels ' for the Wim Wenders film ' Wings of Desire , ' ' has this spirit of improvisation in writing lyrics that I had never seen before , and in approaching this musical , I tried to channel her , ' Pozner said . <p> An about-face <p> If Weymouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former bandmate is penning sophisticated ditties for kiddies , imagine what the Catskills kiddie who had a pitcher of milk poured on his head by an aggravated Pozner 30 years ago might say ? <p> Time has so transformed the self-described ex-anti-kid that he writes songs for a youth choir in New York City , and is so committed to a youth performing-arts camp in Portugal that he is contemplating moving there full time . <p> Time also has evolved his musical career , which began humbly as a teenager playing piano in the Catskills for fading stars such as Barbara Eden , Joel Grey , Mel Brooks , Henny Youngman and Chubby Checker . <p> ' That was a place where they do n't want to pay anyone but they will want to use you and exploit you , ' he said , ' so you can play for people who could n't get gigs anywhere else anymore . ' <p> And to think he had to work his way up to that . Before he got to tickle Eden 's ivories , Pozner had to play the piano as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before that , he was a waiter , ' and since I was new , they give me all kids , ' he said . ' These kids were beyond belief obnoxious . So I poured a pitcher of milk on this one kid 's head and , well , then I was no longer a waiter . ' <p> Pozner 's professional career began in earnest playing synthesizer for electro-dance bands in Europe , which led to gigs working for Peter Gabriel , Roberta Flack and the Gipsy Kings . His big break came when he was hired to produce a solo record for legendary Talking Heads keyboardist Bernie Worrell . <p> ' Immediately after I was hired , Bernie decided to take a gig with the Pretenders , because he always takes 3,000 gigs at once , ' he said . ' But he had an album due , and so he taught me how to play the clavinet just like he did . ' <p> Pozner was so successful , ' even his managers could n't believe the music was mine , ' he said . ' It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you should hire me . ' <p> That 's exactly what Weymouth and Frantz did in 1987 , when they were charged with producing a record for Ziggy Marley . They wanted Worrell on keys . <p> They got Pozner . <p> ' Chris and Tina do not like working with anyone they did n't know , ' Pozner said . ' So they said to their engineer , ' Have you ever heard of a keyboard player named Gary Pozner ? ' And he said , ' Yeah , actually I grew up two blocks from Gary Pozner in Brooklyn . You guys should hire him ! " <p> By then , the Talking Heads had stopped touring and Weymouth and Frantz wanted to turn the Tom Tom Club , a seven-year side project , into a real band . <p> ' Chris said , ' We 'll play CBGBs for 15 nights straight , and we 'll come out a band , " Pozner said . ' And at the very first sound check , we sounded like one . ' <p> Good thing . The crowd that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ramones . By the second night , Harry was singing along with the band , and by the time word got out that CBGBs legend Lou Reed wanted to sing ' Psycho Killer ' as the finale one night , the Tom Tom Club was a local phenomenon . <p> ' CBGB 's holds about 230 people , but they sold 1,500 tickets that night , ' Pozner said . ' People were stacked on top of one another . ' <p> Pozner left the band in 1991 to form an African-Celtic-gospel- <p> rock band called EO , which includes former members of the Waterboys , They Might Be Giants and Mambo X. He has spent much of the past decade scoring television programs , including the four-hour ' Russia , Land of the Czars , ' which became the highest-rated show in the history of the History Channel . <p> He was recommended to Love by a mutual associate at HBO . Pozner passed on the initial offer because of the time commitment , but on a chance trip through Denver , he took in last season 's ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Douglas was doing something different , that was really well-done , ' he said . ' So I told him , ' If you really think I can do it , I want to give it a try . " <p> He jumped on the chance to score Jules Verne 's classic , which had changed his life as a boy . <p> ' I was totally in awe of Jules Verne , because I could n't believe that this one man had envisioned all of this , and a time machine , and air travel , ' Pozner said . ' Reading his work opened up this other world for me . All of a sudden I could imagine for the first time . ' <p> Pozner was just starting on ' Nautilus ' when another break came his way . He received a frantic call from National Geographic , which was in need of immediate help on a new series called ' The Mysteries of the Deep . ' He sent off samples of sea-sounds he was tinkering with for ' Nautilus , ' and was told they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have known ? ' and I just said , ' Ah , heck , you know , I 'm just really good . " <p> He 's definitely in the big ( 20,000 ) leagues . <p> Sea fare <p> What : ' Nautilus : 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea ' <p> Presented by:Walden Family Playhouse , 14500 W.
