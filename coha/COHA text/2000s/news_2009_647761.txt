" Where are you from ? " A Roman Catholic in 1940s Chicago might have answered , " St. Rita 's , " " St. Bernard 's , " or " St. Columbanus , " - identification by parish , not by neighborhood . <p> It was boom time for the Catholic Church in the United States : Between birth and conversion rates , the ranks of US Catholics were swelling . Men were joining the priesthood in record numbers and Catholic schools becoming an institution in their own right . " Catholic ghettos " provided religious , social , and educational outlets so encompassing that a Catholic could go days without substantial interaction with someone of another faith . <p> In some ways , however , American Catholicism became a victim of its own success . That self-contained life that some Catholics enjoyed would be fundamentally altered within 20 years , when World War II and postwar educational initiatives assimilated the nation 's 50 million Catholics to such a degree that the Catholic John F. Kennedy was elected president in 1960 . <p> From that point on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Catholic " in a changing world , a project that continues today . <p> That 's what being a " practicing " Catholic means , writes James Carroll , a writer , Boston Globe columnist , former Paulist priest , and dedicated Catholic born in Chicago in 1943 . <p> Carroll 's memoir Practicing Catholic uses his own life as a lens through which he explores the development of American Catholicism from the time of his birth - when the challenges of individualism and ecumenism grew - through today 's hurdles : a continuing battle over birth control , fallout from clergy sex-abuse scandals , and the marginalization of women . <p> These challenges persist due to hierarchical attempts to quash to church reforms of the 1960s , Carroll says , stressing that change must come from those who sit in the pews . <p> " For us , the primary meaning of ' practicing is that , through these disciplines , rituals , and searches , we have some prospect of getting better , " he writes , challenging the church to share power , while acknowledging how far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declaration of papal infallibility came relatively late from Rome ( 1870 ) but by Carroll 's youth , American Catholics " had forgotten that the Pope-centeredness of our faith was a modern phenomenon . " <p> Power was further centralized shortly after Carroll 's birth , when Pope Pius XII issued Mystici Corporis ( The Mystical Body ) , an encyclical codifying that , " Just as Jesus had all the attributes of a human yet was divine , so with the institution of which he was a founder . " <p> While belonging to a " divine institution " may have soothed some of the pain of American Catholics encountering pervasive anti-Catholic attitudes , the encyclical nevertheless reflected Catholics feelings of inferiority inside church walls , writes Carroll , whose most powerful childhood memory is of parishioners kneeling in church , repeating , " Lord , I am not worthy ... Lord , I am not worthy ... Lord , I am not worthy . " <p> But as Catholics grew in number and stature - by the early 1950s there were some 50,000 priests , 400 seminaries , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on individual choice and interreligious dialogue . <p> American Jesuit John Courtney Murray , for example , stressed that natural law enabled Catholics to make moral decisions , and that the separation of church and state best ensures religious freedom . After his sister married a Jew , Boston Archbishop Richard Cushing campaigned against the doctrine of " no salvation outside the church . " <p> " At age ten , I felt an intense relief to be able to assure my chums and fellow Boy Scouts - Protestant Dickie Boris , Jewish Peter Seligman - that as far as I was concerned they were fine with God , " Carroll writes . <p> Carroll later joined the Paulist Fathers , a US-founded order whose members made " promises " rather than vows . Instead of a " rule , " the Paulists adopted a constitution , " an implicit attack on the very structure of hierarchy . " <p> The movement for a more inclusive church hit a high point in the 1960s , when the Vatican II council approved celebrating mass in the vernacular , and defined the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purification , " Carroll writes . <p> But while Vatican II ushered in reforms , it also incited " Catholic fundamentalists " - Carroll includes current Pope Benedict XVI among that group - to attempt to retain centralized church control via actions in three key areas . <p> Birth control is one . A 1964 encyclical ruled that the pope alone handles teaching on birth control , even though there was no history of church teaching on it , Carroll writes . <p> And refusing to acquiesce on birth control , " There was no way the Church could ease up on the sexual demand it imposed on clergy . " One result of imposed celibacy , Carroll writes , was that some priests became cold , others secretive - a " petrified clerical culture , " that was somehow complicit with the many archbishops who simply moved abusive priests , rather than handing them over to authorities . <p> Third , Carroll from an " important disciple " into a repentant prostitute , disempowering her " so that her succeeding sisters in the Church would not compete with men for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholics to address . <p> Writing a memoir is one way , of course , to raise public consciousness . But memoirs like " Practicing Catholic " provide only a slice of the picture , colored by the writer 's experiences and priorities , which may or may not reflect universal challenges . Does Catholic teaching on birth control , for example , really hinder today 's American Catholics , when surveys regularly show some 75 percent of Catholics disagree with the ban ? <p> A bigger problem with " Practicing Catholic , " however , is the book 's lack of female voices , despite a lengthy discussion on the church 's oppression of women . Former Boston College professor Mary Daly gets a mention , but Carroll 's contemporaries - women like activist Dorothy Day , Mother Theresa , anti-death-penalty leader Sr. Helen Prejean , and Catholic scholar and theologian Rosemary Radford Ruether - are all left out . <p> Similarly , only passing note is made of the Catholic church 's advocacy work on human rights , including women 's rights - even within some of the encyclicals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church control . <p> Carroll never claims to provide the entire picture , and his memories are n't all dark . He passionately describes working with conscientious objectors at Boston University during the Vietnam War and helping other students create a democratic , welcoming chapel - all while preaching a Gospel he believed in and by which he was invigorated . <p> He vividly links his own civil rights work on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial to the church 's gradual turn towards accepting common ground with Jews . And he uses lyrical prose to describe Catholic personalities with wit and compassion : Readers will close Carroll 's book feeling they know the gregarious Archbishop Cushing , for example , a South Boston everyman who , in lighter moments wore outrageous hats and visited nuns with bags full of Hershey 's kisses announcing , " These are the only kisses you and me will ever get ! " <p> Nevertheless , Carroll admits he felt " anguish " when joining the order he ultimately left more than 35 years ago ( he always had uncertainty , he admits - uncertainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible to read the memoir without wondering how that colored some of his stronger condemnations of clerical culture and Catholic feelings of subservience . <p> Or the idea that values must change - understandable perhaps regarding teaching on birth control , but should the church really compromise on core concepts like its preferential treatment of the poor ? <p> Changing doctrine can be murky . But perhaps that 's why Carroll remains in the mix : his faith combines both ritual and reform . <p> Sarah More McCann is an intern at the Monitor . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2009 .
