But to transform this basic house into a true home-personal , comfortable , and workable for a family with two little boys-they consulted with interior designer and Country Living contributing editor , Stanley Hura . " We had a scrapbook of ideas and knew the sorts of things we wanted , " says Kristy . " But Stanley really pulled the look of the house together-without going over our budget . " His secret : Do n't think just room by room , but consider the house as a whole .
