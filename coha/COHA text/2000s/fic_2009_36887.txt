Greer Beckett breathed deeply , filling her lungs with the same air that caressed her upturned face . Indian summer . She had once heard Seattle 's weather described as " perpetual drizzle interrupted by occasional rain . " The remark was fairly accurate much of the time , but she doubted if any city could be more spectacular on a balmy , mid-September day like this . <p> She glanced at her adoptive sister who sat beside her on a bench . A breeze ruffled Casey Wyatt 's short , blond curls . Her pert features were arranged into a distant expression . <p> " What are you thinking about , Case ? " <p> Casey stirred . " How much I like being here , with you . I 've been very lucky . " <p> " Not half as lucky as me , " Greer replied . She touched Casey 's hand lightly and concentrated on the familiar scene around them . " I 'm still grateful I managed to salvage enough out of the business to open Britmania . I 've also never regretted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always feels so alive . " <p> Pioneer Square was crammed with its usual assortment of humanity . Tourists and local workers rubbed shoulders with shambling street people amid a jumble of small , offbeat shops and restaurants bordering the cobblestone plaza . The city hugged the square on three sides . Towering modern buildings in the central business district loomed immediately north , like a painted backdrop against a cerulean sky . To the west a warren of narrow streets led beneath a viaduct to Elliot Bay and the awesome vista of Puget Sound and the snowcapped Olympic mountains beyond . <p> On a bench across from Casey and Greer , an old man lay outstretched , his bare ankles pale between ragged polyester pants and the tops of new army boots . A yellowed newspaper shaded his face from the early afternoon sun , and his crossed hands rose and fell atop a protruding belly that jiggled with each breath . Greer eyed the brown paper sack wedged between his body and the back of the bench , noting that the wine was probably the only possession he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man came from and who missed him . Dozens of transients roamed the area day and night , but she could never think of them as faceless and forgotten . Everyone had a past . <p> Casey had hooked her elbows over the seat back and crossed her long legs . Her pink T-shirt , which read , Seat-tleites Do n't Tan , They Rust , was hiked up to show an inch of smooth midriff . <p> " Sis , " she said , peering sideways at Greer . " Let 's be irresponsible . " <p> " What did you have in mind ? " Greer asked cautiously . <p> Casey 's eyes closed like a lazy cat . " Taking the afternoon off . " <p> Greer chuckled and brushed sandwich crumbs from her lap . " Lunch break 's over for me . Time to get back to the grind . You can fritter away the rest of the day if you want to . But if we 're going to keep on paying the rent and covering my expensive whims , someone had better tend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Casey put an arm around Greer 's shoulders and squeezed . " This trip back to England is n't a whim . It 's something you 've got to do . And it 'll be good for the store , too . Where better to dredge up some oddball British memorabilia ? " She tugged her hair theatrically , stopping with her elbows pointing to the sky . " The mind boggles . I can see the newspapers . ' Glamorous proprietor of Seattle 's trendiest shop does it again . Import store becomes the only American establishment to stock genuine imitation crown jewels . Orders are being taken at Britmania by  --  ' " <p> Greer placed a finger to Casey 's lips . " You 're wonderful . I love you . But you talk too much . Stay and soak up the sun for a while . I 'll start back . " She stood , threw the remnants of her lunch into a garbage can and adjusted her belt around her tiny waist . <p> " Okay , slave driver . You win . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was only trying to make you take it easy for once . You push yourself too hard . Remember what the doctor said ? It has n't been two months since the hysterectomy and he told you to give yourself at least three before returning to full activity . " <p> " I do n't want to discuss that . " <p> " Why ? " Casey shook her head impatiently at a grizzled man who approached from a doorway , his hand held out . " Why do n't you want to discuss it , Greer ? It 's unnatural for you to avoid something so traumatic as if it never happened . " <p> While Casey marched ahead Greer dug in her purse for some coins . " Here , Charlie , " she said to the white-haired man , who gave a courtly , slightly wobbly bow . " Something to eat this time , okay ? " She handed him the money . He closed his grimy fingers around the money and displayed a mouthful of stained teeth . <p> " I wish you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to her . " You should n't encourage these people . They know you 're a soft touch . " <p> Greer shrugged , grateful for the change of subject . " It does n't hurt anything . And I 've seen you do the same thing . Want to go to Takara for dinner tonight ? " <p> " Maybe . Is it four weeks or five before you leave ? " <p> " Five . October 21 . " <p> " I worry about you going alone . Why do n't we hire someone to run the shop and I 'll come with you ? " <p> Familiar threads of anxiety started to wind through Greer . " No . Even if we could afford it . This is one thing I want to do by myself . And there 's nothing to worry about . Anyone listening to you would think you were the one who was four years older instead of me . I know what 's best for me . " <p> " Josh would help us out " <p> " No ! " Greer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Josh Field had been Colin 's partner and , since she became a widow , Greer 's close friend  --  too close for Greer . Lately she sensed his growing impatience for more than a platonic attachment . She wanted to gently discourage the relationship , not encourage it . <p> Casey caught Greer 's elbow and pulled her to a halt . " Look at me , " she said . " Your behavior is n't normal . " <p> Two couples passed , glancing curiously at the women . " This is n't the time or place for this , " Greer muttered , feeling her color rise . <p> " There never is a time or place . But at least out in the open , you ca n't hide . Please , Greer , do n't stay clammed up like this . I 've waited weeks for you to let your feelings out . " <p> " I do n't feel anything , " Greer insisted . At five foot one , Greer had to crane her neck to meet her tall sister 's eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ? We 're late . " <p> " Fine , " Casey said as she released Greer 's arm . " Keep on pretending you do n't give a damn . When you said you were going back to England , I thought you 'd decided to stop pretending you do n't care about all that 's happened to you . You 're only twenty-six . And you 're gorgeous . You ought to marry again and we both know who 'd be only too happy to oblige . " <p> Greer walked faster , but Casey hardly lengthened her stride to stay alongside . They crossed Occidental Square and headed for Post Street where they had rented space in the basement of a renovated building . <p> " Listen , Greer , " Casey began , before having to dodge a wild-eyed teenager in a headset who practiced a dance that took up the width of the sidewalk . " Listen , " she repeated as they fell into step again . <p> A panicky sensation invaded Greer 's stomach . She smiled , knowing the effort was obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me off on poor Josh Field , forget it . Just because he used to be Colin 's partner , and he 's been good to me , it does n't mean he wants to get permanently saddled with a cripple . " <p> " Give me a break , " Casey exploded . " You limp a bit . Since when did that make you a cripple ? And if you 're worried about not being able to have children , big deal . Mom and Dad adopted you . They felt exactly the same about both of us , and if you adopted kids you 'd love them , too . Anyway , I do n't think Josh even likes children that much . You 'd be perfect for each other . " <p> The panicky sensation spread to Greer 's legs . Why would Casey choose now to bring all this up ? There was nothing to say that had n't already been said a hundred times . She slowed down , forcing herself to take deep breaths . " Do n't get mad , Case . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A garish poster flapped away from a wall as they passed and Casey batted it with a fist . " I 'm not mad , just frustrated . Josh is n't good to you , as you put it . The guy 's crazy about you and all he gets is the runaround . " <p> " That 's not true . " <p> " It is , sis . He wants you to be his wife . " <p> They reached the flight of stairs leading down to Britma-nia . " I 've been a wife . And I had the best husband in the world . That 's enough , more than most women ever have , " she said , favoring her right leg slightly as she walked down . <p> Casey 's backless sandals slapped the concrete when she loped past , taking two steps at a time . She fumbled in her jeans ' pocket and produced a key . " Colin was a good man . But he was n't a saint . " She unlocked the door and went inside . Quickly she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I understood that the main reason for you going to England again was to make another attempt to find your biological family . And I thought that was great . But I 'm beginning to suspect the real reason . What you want to do most is be where you last were with Colin , is n't it ? You 're going to his and Colleen 's graves , are n't you ? " <p> " Yes , " Greer muttered . She took a comb from her purse and started to drag it through her hair . " Is that so strange ? " <p> " I suppose not , " Casey said . China wine decanters  --  each shaped like one of the wives of Henry VIII  --  clattered as she pushed them to the end of a shelf . " Maybe there you 'll finally cry the tears that must be waterlogging your brain by now . Put the ghosts to rest and get on with your life . " She twisted a ceramic head sharply on its cork neck . <p> " Look , Casey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm not falling apart . When I first got back here I was pretty broken up . Destroyed would be a better description , but who would n't be ? If I did n't cry then it was because I was too numb , and later there was n't time . " <p> " Greer " <p> " No , Case . You wanted me to spill all this , so let me finish . " <p> Taking several deliberate steps , Greer reached the door , locked it and turned the sign around to read closed . She paced in front of her sister . " I want to trace my original family very much . And I do intend to search for them . But I never faced up to Colin and Colleen dying . They say you have to go through a bunch of phases to grieve properly , and I missed just about all of them . I thought about it a lot while I was in the hospital for the hysterectomy and decided I 'd like to try and catch up . Does that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad . You know I did n't mean to criticize you , do n't you , sis ? " Casey inquired gently . <p> " Yes , I know , but it 's important to get things straight between us , " Greer answered just as gently . " Before the accident , Josh had already signed the papers to buy Colin out . I took what money was left after  --  after everything  --  and made it work for me . You make it sound as if I 've sat around for two years feeling sorry for myself . " <p> " I never said that " <p> " Pretty close . I know Colin would approve , of Britmania and of what I 've done . He 'd be proud of me . And I thought you enjoyed all this  --  this crazy stuff we deal in . It works , and it uses my only real talent  --  imagination . I love selling ashtrays with coats of arms to people named Smith . It 's a kick to watch customers cart away bits of the white cliffs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers . Oh , sure , they pretend the whole thing 's a big spoof but they enjoy every minute of it . And we make a good living . As far as I 'm concerned that 's success , and I made it . " Greer paused . Her blood pumped hard and it felt good . <p> Casey massaged her temples . " Every word you say is true . You 've done marvelously well . I love being a part of it all , and you know that . But I still say you 're avoiding the point . " <p> " I do n't know what you mean . " <p> " You do . " The younger woman grasped Greer 's shoulders and backed her to a chair . " Sit there and listen . All you 're talking about is the business . There 's no question that it 's a success . But I 'm worried about you  --  Greer Beckett , the woman . If Josh twists your arm you go out to dinner or the theater . By eleven you 're home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee . The guy wants you . If you gave him one little word of encouragement he 'd whisk you down the aisle so fast our heads would spin . " <p> To her horror Greer felt moisture well in her eyes . She tipped her head back , but the tears sprang free and coursed down her cheeks . " Do you think I do n't know that ? " she whispered . " And feel like a creep about it ? " <p> Casey dropped to her knees , cradling Greer 's head against her shoulder . " I do n't know how you feel . You never tell me . " <p> " I do n't want to marry Josh . I do n't want to marry anyone . If I live to be a hundred I 'll always miss Colin . I have n't cried because I 'm afraid that if I do I 'll never stop . " She felt herself begin to tremble and took a deep , controlling breath . " If you just relax Casey , everything will be fine . Josh will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend . I have all I want . Forget the idea I 'm yearning for new beginnings . " <p> " Oh , Greer , " Casey said in a wobbly voice , " I want you to be happy . " <p> " I am . Please let it go at that . " <p> Casey sat back on her heels and sniffed . " Okay . I guess I 'll have to  --  for now . Need a tissue ? " <p> Greer swiped her cheeks with the backs of her hands . " Yup . But I 'll get it . Turn that sign over , kid . I 'm going to unpack the stuff that was delivered this morning . Then I 'll make us some coffee . " Before she went through the door to the storeroom she looked over her shoulder . Casey was still on her knees , staring through the window . " You did n't say yes or no to Takara 's for dinner , " Greer said , deftly smoothing over the awkward moment . " Sushi 's healthy , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place and have seven-layer mocha cake  --  just to keep up our energy . " <p> " You 're on , " Casey said , not turning around . Her voice was muffled . <p> Greer went into the sloping space under the stairs of the business behind Britmania . A naked electric bulb hung from a long wire that could be looped over various hooks in the wall , depending on where light was needed . How could she explain feelings that were a mystery even to her ? Greer started the coffee maker and went to work opening boxes . <br> Continues ...
