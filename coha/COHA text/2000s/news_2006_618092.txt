<p> Atlanta headhunter William Reeves has brokered some of the Southeast 's most notable executive search deals during the past two decades . But even Reeves is surprised at the pace of turnovers lately in the upper echelons of Atlanta 's executive suites . <p> Equifax . AGL Resources . Coca-Cola Enterprises . Georgia-Pacific . Newell Rubbermaid . Those are the big ones . Headhunters estimate there are even more CEO departures in the ranks of smaller firms . <p> " This is unusual to have this much turnover in this market , " said Reeves , senior director at Spencer Stuart . <p> Executive defections are n't new . But the stakes are higher , riskier and , for those with staying power and the right skills , more lucrative . <p> CEOs and other top officers face greater personal and financial scrutiny . Company boards , once rubber stamps for many CEOs , are taking a more adversarial role . <p> " In Atlanta , we 're not immune to the same pressures everybody else experiences , " said Dale Jones , Atlanta-based managing partner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Everybody wants it faster , sooner and quicker . And everybody wants a CEO with a proven track record . " <p> The fishbowl existence has CEOs  --  and other top-level officers  --  jumping ship in unprecedented numbers . <p> Last month , 148 CEOs nationwide left their jobs , the highest number of departures since Chicago-area outplacement firm Challenger , Gray &; Christmas began tracking executive movements in August 1999 . <p> The disgruntled and discarded are n't the only ones in this latest wave of defections . Nearly one in five who left were lured away by competitors or they left to start their own venture . <p> And the defections extend beyond the CEO 's office . <p> More than 3,160 top-level management changes were recorded in May , the highest in the two years Liberum Research of New York has tracked executive turnover . The firm monitors changes among CEOs , chief financial officers and other top-level jobs as well as boards of directors , where defections have been " particularly pronounced . " <p> Scrutiny is n't the only reason they 're leaving . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially for executives , " said John Challenger , CEO of Challenger , Gray &; Christmas . " It 's a free-agent CEO market , the likes of which we have never seen . " <p> Pay grows <p> Executive pay has grown fatter , tenures shorter and their ranks leaner . <p> Venture capital is flush . So are hedge funds . Mergers and acquisitions have created a need for new blood at many companies , not just for CEOs , but chief financial officers , chief operating officers and other top-level executives . <p> The defections are coming amid a troubling problem : an emerging leadership gap . <p> " Leadership is hard to find , " said Emory Mulling , chairman of Mulling Corp. , an Atlanta-based executive search , coaching and outplacement firm . " There 's fewer qualified leaders . So existing executives are finding jobs quicker . " <p> Mulling estimates that 75 percent of middle management jobs have been eliminated in the past two decades , leaving companies with fewer people to groom . <p> At the same time , companies do not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often " do not adhere " to them , Mulling said . <p> The gap has prompted some companies to take risks with executives who 've not previously been chief executives . <p> Heidrick executive Jones cited the new CEO appointments at Newell Rubbermaid and Equifax . <p> " Those guys were not sitting CEOs , " Jones said . " But they have a good opportunity to demonstrate their capabilities . " <p> Retirement delayed <p> Stuart Heap had to delay his early retirement until he could find a suitable replacement for his job as president of a newly created medical device company in Norcross . The company , Molnlycke , is part of a Swedish conglomerate . <p> " It took about six to seven months to bring in my successor , a couple of months longer than I anticipated , " said Heap , who hopes to hand over the reins soon . <p> He cited " a little difficulty attracting the level of person we wanted for the job , " in part because of competition in his industry . <p> Competition has become so intense that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a period that 's almost reminiscent of the dotcom time when there was a lot of turnover . It 's different now , " Challenger said . <p> " There 's a lot of people chasing business , buying up pieces of bigger corporations , buying family businesses and then going out and looking for CEOs to run them . <p> " Most CEOs , certainly any CEO with strong performance , has a search firm sitting at their door with opportunities in hand . " <p> The stepped-up regulatory heat , too , has made finding CEOs especially tough for public companies . <p> Mulling , an executive search industry veteran , recently spoke in Atlanta to a group of top-level financial executives who worked for private companies . <p> During his speech , he asked the group to indicate with a show of hands how many had left public companies . <p> " Seventy-five percent raised their hands , " Mulling said . <p> Search firms thrive <p> The renewed quest for executives has translated into a robust comeback for the multibillion-dollar global executive search firm business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2001 after the dot-com bust . <p> Just last week , one of the world 's largest executive search firms , Korn/Ferry International , reported fourth-quarter revenue from its fees rose 17 percent to $145.3 million . <p> " As the demand for talent continues to escalate worldwide , we have experienced steady and significant growth , " company Chairman and CEO Paul Reilly said in a prepared statement . <p> A typical retained executive search firm  --  a company that is kept on retainer to find talent for a company  --  gets a percentage , usually a third , of the cash compensation of the executive who is hired . Most top search firms deal mostly with executives earning in excess of $300,000 a year . <p> Heidrick &; Struggles ' Atlanta office has hired five consultants in the past two years to handle the workload . <p> Just like companies want strong , quick results from these new CEOs , they want the search firms to find them fast . <p> " We 've seen a strong resurgence in our business , " said Jones , managing partner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has increased tremendously because of the changing landscape of the CEO office . " <p> Jones tied the resurgence to a combination of factors : Sarbanes-Oxley , a shortage of talented executives , wealthy executives wanting to retire young and the investment community and companies wanting quicker results . <p> With all the whirlwind in the executive suites , some worry about the effects of CEOs ' short tenures on corporate America . <p> " You ca n't get that much accomplished , " Challenger said . " It takes you a year to understand what 's going on and establish the necessary relationships . <p> " When they jump and leave , it can leave a lot of companies in a lurch , particularly if they were unprepared and the leave was voluntary . " <p> EXECUTIVE TURNOVER <p> The number of chief executives leaving U.S. companies set a monthly record in May .
