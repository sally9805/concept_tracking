A GROUP OF ATHLETES USES EVERY BIT OF TEAMWORK LEARNED IN SCOUTING TO GET THROUGH ONE OF AMERICA 'S TOUGHEST TESTS . Photograph Photograph After nearly a week of hard travel , a weary Team Phoenix Gold/UPS nears the final stretch of the Primal Quest race . The members of Team Phoenix Gold ( from left to right ) : Todd Olsen , Keith Peterson , Joelle Ypma and Toby Evans . // Four weary travelers enter the home stretch of a six-day , 250-mile grind of hiking , biking , kayaking and mountaineering . Tired ? Centainly . Grouchy ? Not in the least . In fact , former Life Scout Toby Evans , Eagle Scout Keith Peterson and their teammates Todd Olsen and Joelle Ypma make jokes and laugh as they run from Bridal Veil Falls in the Colorado Rocky Mountains toward the ski-resort town of Telluride . The Group , which calls itself Team Phoenix Gold/UPS , is nearing the end of the Primal Quest adventure race . After crossing several mountain passes , enduring an extreme range of temperatures ascending and descending 140,000 feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day after day , they 've tried to gain time over rival teams by skipping sleep or taking shortcuts over ridges . They 've just rappelled off a terrifying 400-foot rock wall near Colorado 's highest free-falling waterfall . But despite hours of sleepless backcountry trekking , they 're in a wacky mood . Photograph A nice smooth , downhill stretch comes at just the right time for ( left to right ) Peterson , Olsen , Evans and Ypma . Peterson finds out that some paths are steeper than others . By the end of the day , the feet of the travelers had paid the price . // " We were all just being kind of goofy , " Evans says . These outdoor adventurers have n't gone bonkers from lack of oxygen at high altitude . They 're happy because they 've just learned that an unlikely ally-a member of a rival team they befriended on the trail-has recovered from heat exhaustion .

Six days of shared struggle has taught them lessons about teamwork , loyalty , sacrifice and friendship-the kind of lessons Evans and Peterson remember from their Scouting days . TRUST YOUR TEAMMATE Adventure racing is sometimes called " Scouting for adults " because the sport takes outdoor skills to an extreme . Teams of four set out with specially designed lightweight backpacks filled with space blankets , water , food and a minimum of personal and mandatory supplies . Each team must reach a series of checkpoints marked on a topographical map . The teams rely on their orienteering and backcountry skills . For part of the race , competitors ride mountain bikes . In another section , they kayak river rapids . The rest of the time , they run and hike . ( See " Grueling Regimen " sidebar . ) But for all its difficulty , adventure racing is n't about being the biggest and strongest . It 's all about attitude . Team members have to trust and help one another , or the group could crumble apart on the trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ski Resort a week earlier , Evans and Peterson knew the race would test their loyalty and friendship . But they had no idea just how extreme that test would be . During the first days of racing , Team Phoenix Gold/UPS was neck-and-neck with rival Team Baja , made up of Scott Key , Pamela Fletcher , Susan Murphy and Kiviok Hight . Just when Team PhoenixGold/UPS believed it had gained a few hours by taking a shortcut over a ridge or by skipping sleep , Team Baja would show up .

When you 're rappelling off cliffs in 95-degree heat , you ca n't drink too much water . // Olsen had been working especially hard to maintain a fast pace . But at around 1 a.m. on Day Three , he began to stumble . " He was sleep deprived , he was low on food , and he started to wander all over the road , " Evans said . The team put Olsen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one tent they 'd carried along , wrapping themselves in space blankets and hoping to catch up on sleep in the chilly night air . At 5:30 a.m. , they heard the footsteps of Team Baja . GRUELING REGIMEN Adventure racers say the key to a successful competition-or any great backcountry trek-is being prepared . They get into shape by starting slowly , and then gradually increase the intensity of their workouts over a period of months . They study the terrain and climate they 'll be racing in . Primal Quest , for example , was all about mountains and summer heat . The best adventure racers write down their outdoor-trekking weaknesses , then practice to improve them . They experiment with different foods and sports drinks ahead of time . Teams get together to go over topographical maps weeks before hitting the trail . Most important , they develop a strong rapport with their teammates , so that once in the wilderness , they can overcome unanticipated obstacles together .

Then the two teams packed up and headed down the trail as inseparable friends . " From then on , " Peterson says , " we decided we were going to finish together . " After another grueling day of hiking , the two teams made it to the last difficult climb , a seemingly endless trail that peaked at more than 13,000 feet . Just before the team crested the climb , Peterson noticed Team Baja member Might was n't drinking enough water . " The next thing we know , he 's curled up in a ball on the side of the road , " Evans says . The two teams were just 30 minutes from Bridal Veil Falls .

Competitors often work throughout the night , trying to gain a step on the competition . // WINNING IS N'T EVERYTHING It 's 2 p.m. and Peterson sits in the dry grass near Hight 's makeshift tent . He 's hot , exhausted , disappointed and frustrated . But , like his teammates , Peterson is determined to stick with his fallen rival . " It 's something you learn in Scouts , " Peterson says . " When somebody needs help , you stop and help them . " After six hours , medics arrive and inject special hydrating solution into Hight 's arm . Team Baja members insist that Team Phoenix Gold/UPS continue on alone .

" There are always choices and compromises in the things you need to do , " Peterson says . " In the end , though , when you 've made a compromise to help somebody else , you win in a different way .

Peterson , 49 , who earned his Eagle Scout badge in 1970 with Troop 191 in Happy Valley , Ore. , planned what he calls the Grand Slam of Endurance : running four individual 100-plus mile ultramarathons in the most extreme circumstances : at the highest and lowest altitudes , and in the hottest and coldest temperatures imaginable . The coldest , a 130-miler in Alaska in February , and the hottest , 150 miles in the Sahara in April , had already been completed before the Primal Quest . In July 2002 , ten days after the Primal Quest race , Peterson completed a 135-mile foot race from The United States ' lowest point of Death Valley , Calif. , at 282 feet below sea level , to the portals of Mount Whitney , a peak of more than 14,000 feet . In October , Peterson completed his Grand Slam of Endurance by running a 100-mile race in the Himalayas with elevations up to 15,000 feet .
