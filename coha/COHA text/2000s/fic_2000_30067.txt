ARYA At Winterfell they had called her " Arya Horseface " and she 'd thought nothing could be worse , but that was before the orphan boy Lommy Greenhands had named her " Lumpyhead . " Her head felt lumpy when she touched it . When Yoren had dragged her into that alley she 'd thought he meant to kill her , but the sour old man had only held her tight , sawing through her mats and tangles with his dagger . She remembered how the breeze sent the fistfuls of dirty brown hair skittering across the paving stones , toward the sept where her father had died . " I 'm taking men and boys from the city , " Yoren growled as the sharp steel scraped at her head . " Now you hold still , boy . " By the time he had finished , her scalp was nothing but tufts and stubble . Afterward he told her that from there to Winterfell she 'd be Arry the orphan boy . " Gate should n't be hard , but the road 's another matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company . I got thirty this time , men and boys all bound for the Wall , and do n't be thinking they 're like that bastard brother o ' yours . " He shook her . " Lord Eddard gave me pick o ' the dungeons , and I did n't find no little lordlings down there . This lot , half o ' them would turn you over to the queen quick as spit for a pardon and maybe a few silvers . The other half 'd do the same , only they 'd rape you first . So you keep to yourself and make your water in the woods , alone . That 'll be the hardest part , the pissing , so do n't drink no more'n you need . " Leaving King 's Landing was easy , just like he 'd said . The Lannister guardsmen on the gate were stopping everyone , but Yoren called one by name and their wagons were waved through . No one spared Arya aglance . They were looking for a highborn girl , daughter of the King 's Hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . Arya never looked back . She wished the Rush would rise and wash the whole city away , Flea Bottom and the Red Keep and the Great Sept and everything , and everyone too , especially Prince Joffrey and his mother . But she knew it would n't , and anyhow Sansa was still in the city and would wash away too . When she remembered that , Arya decided to wish for Winterfell instead . Yoren was wrong about the pissing , though . That was n't the hardest part at all ; Lommy Greenhands and Hot Pie were the hardest part . Orphan boys . Yoren had plucked some from the streets with promises of food for their bellies and shoes for their feet . The rest he 'd found in chains . " The Watch needs good men , " he told them as they set out , " but you lot will have to do . " Yoren had taken grown men from the dungeons as well , thieves and poachers and rapers and the like . The worst were the three he 'd found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because he kept them fettered hand and foot in the back of a wagon , and vowed they 'd stay in irons all the way to the Wall . One had no nose , only the hole in his face where it had been cut off , and the gross fat bald one with the pointed teeth and the weeping sores on his cheeks had eyes like nothing human . They took five wagons out of King 's Landing , laden with supplies for the Wall : hides and bolts of cloth , bars of pig iron , a cage of ravens , books and paper and ink , a bale of sourleaf , jars of oil , and chests of medicine and spices . Teams of plow horses pulled the wagons , and Yoren had bought two coursers and a half-dozen donkeys for the boys . Arya would have preferred a real horse , but the donkey was better than riding on a wagon . The men paid her no mind , but she was not so lucky with the boys . She was two years younger than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Lommy and Hot Pie took her silence to mean she was scared , or stupid , or deaf . " Look at that sword Lumpyhead 's got there , " Lommy said one morning as they made their plodding way past orchards and wheat fields . He 'd been a dyer 's apprentice before he was caught stealing , and his arms were mottled green to the elbow . When he laughed he brayed like the donkeys they were riding . " Where 's a gutter rat like Lumpyhead get him a sword ? " Arya chewed her lip sullenly . She could see the back of Yoren 's faded black cloak up ahead of the wagons , but she was determined not to go crying to him for help . " Maybe he 's a little squire , " Hot Pie put in . His mother had been a baker before she died , and he 'd pushed her cart through the streets all day , shouting " Hot pies ! Hot pies ! " " Some lordy lord 's little squire boy , that 's it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I bet that 's not even areal sword . I bet it 's just some play sword made of tin . " Arya hated them making fun of Needle . " It 's castle-forged steel , you stupid , " she snapped , turning in the saddle to glare at them , " and you better shut your mouth . " The orphan boys hooted . " Where 'd you get a blade like that , Lumpyface ? " Hot Pie wanted to know . " Lumpyhead , " corrected Lommy . " He prob'ly stole it . " " I did not ! " she shouted . Jon Snow had given her Needle . Maybe she had to let them call her Lumpyhead , but she was n't going to let them call Jon a thief . " If he stole it , we could take it off him , " said Hot Pie . " It 's not his anyhow . I could use me a sword like that . " Lommy egged him on . " Go on , take it off him , I dare you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hey , Lumpyface , you gim me that sword . " His hair was the color of straw , his fat face all sunburnt and peeling . " You do n't know how to use it . " Yes I do , Arya could have said . I killed a boy , a fat boy like you , I stabbed him in the belly and he died , and I 'll kill you too if you do n't let me alone . Only she did not dare . Yoren did n't know about the stableboy , but she was afraid of what he might do if he found out . Arya was pretty sure that some of the other men were killers too , the three in the manacles for sure , but the queen was n't looking for them , so it was n't the same . " Look at him , " brayed Lommy Greenhands . " I bet he 's going to cry now . You want to cry , Lumpyhead ? " She had cried in her sleep the night before , dreaming of herfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and could not have shed another tear if her life had hung on it .
