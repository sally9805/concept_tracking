Three nights later , and the chill autumn wind prowled over a desert painted silver by a brooding half-moon . It simmered like a window fan set angrily on low , fretting at chimes and whirligigs on porches , then gusted up hard enough to rattle windows in their frames and bow the jagged crowns of Joshua trees and yucca plants , roaring in across the empty California desert as if looking for a place to hide from whatever chased it . <p> A storm was coming , but nobody had the slightest clue how bad it was going to get . <p> The news of the day was focused elsewhere , loaded with the same domestic absurdity and foreign atrocity as ever , fodder aplenty for arguments that the world continued to chase its own tail , or charge straight off a cliff . <p> For those looking for signs of the end times-aside from the wars , floods , famines , hurricanes , earthquakes , tsunamis , conspiracies , scandals , UFO sightings , soaring oil prices , homosexual agendas , and polar ice caps melting-there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A " rather popular " Shiite cleric-whose name reporters dutifully mangled with every repetition-was killed by a suicide bomber in Basra , along with two dozen of his followers . After loudly denouncing the sectarian violence and American occupation of Iraq , he foretold his own death , but proclaimed that " I will be the last to die . " <p> The assassin who made the cleric a martyr was disguised as an Iraqi policeman . His prophecy held true for three eerily quiet days , until this morning , when an IED outside Kirkuk flipped a Humvee filled with marines . <p> In other news-and a stunning reversal of centuries-old doctrine-the Catholic Church issued a digital papal bull closing the limbo loophole , retroactively consigning untold millions of pagan babies to the fires of hell . <p> This , combined with their admission that life on other planets did not contradict biblical infallibility-since extraterrestrials would be " God 's children , too " - begged the question : what else did the pope suddenly know that he was n't letting the rest of the world in on ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort to bereaved humanity , or at least some closure , as a melting glacier off Baffin Island disgorged the frigid remains of a Kiwi survey plane and its crew , given up for lost in 1964 . Loved ones and descendents gathered on a chartered ship to watch as the wreckage thawed in the summer sun , then tumbled into the sea . <p> Signs and portents . But mostly smoke and mirrors . For gloomy true believers and faithless curmudgeons alike , the real indicators never appeared as mainstream news . They were tiny details , stuck between the cracks of consensus reality : hidden in sacred texts and environmental reports , research dug from the Fortean Times , or the rantings of little-known small-town cable access prophets . <p> For most people , the only news that mattered was the substance of life that impacted them directly : money , jobs , friends , and loved ones . The world was too big , too unwieldy to fathom . The question was , " How are you today ? " <p> On a desert road in the Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what would JESUS DO ? <p> The frightened people inside asked themselves the same question . It was a personal question , which they kept to themselves . <p> The desert , as always , was full of secrets . <p> But the storm was blowing in . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
