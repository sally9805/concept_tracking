1 . Eric : <br> Welcome Back to the Void <p> If you 've never been blown up before , I ca n't recommend it . I suggest it even less if the perpetrators are using blessed shaped charges of C-4 . Being atomized by that kind of firepower would have ended most vampires , but I 'm not that lucky . I 'm special . <p> In ice cream terms , vampires come in three flavors : chocolate , strawberry , and vanilla . I 'm grape sherbet  --  hard to come by and much more likely to give you brain freeze . Technically there 's one more type of vampire , Drones , but they 're barely even immortal  --  the vampire equivalent of ice milk  --  and they certainly would n't have survived what happened to me . <p> My name is Eric Courtney and up until several minutes ago , I was a vampire . Now ... ? Let 's just say I 'm working on it . <p> The only good thing about being explosively deconstructed was that the sensation was new and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting too bored . Being blown up by my best friend , having my body destroyed , and seeing my strip club obliterated were n't what I would have chosen to shake things up , but I 've learned to roll with the punches , even the sucker ones . <p> For the first few seconds I actually thought I might be really most sincerely dead . Ended . Gone for good . I hovered over the still blazing ruin of my strip club , a glowing blue specter wearing jeans and a Welcome to the Void T-shirt ; unseen , unheard , and utterly unamused . The neon sign flared impressively before melting into slag . Shards of glass covered the street between the Demon Heart and the old Pollux Theater , where the Casablanca poster in the display began to wither under the intense heat , browning at the edges as it curled . I owned both buildings , having bought them inexpensively after , of all things , a fire . <p> Security alarms from the buildings on the block adjoining mine rang out into the night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How do I get my body back ? <p> That was the first question . I 'd been reduced to ashes before , but Talbot ( my ... bouncer ) or one of my other employees had always been around to pour blood on my remains . Vampires run on blood , so blood plus vampire ashes meant poof  --  instant vampire , kind of like the instant Martians in those old Looney Tunes animated shorts . I had no idea how Talbot and the gang could bring me back this time , though . No ashes . <p> Being a ghost was n't all bad , at least . As a ghost , my thoughts were clearer than they 'd ever been , and the hunger for blood , that ever-present inner dark that had driven me to do most of the questionable things I 'd done in my unlife , was gone . It was as if , for once , my brain worked like everybody else 's ; no memories seemed to hover just out of reach . Even my attitude had shifted . I 'm an angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger replaced by pain and more grief than I 'd ever felt before , a sense of endless loss . <p> The world of the living was a faded watercolor painting seen through my noncorporeal eyes , blurry and surreal . Most of the Demon Heart 's side of the street burned , flames devouring the place hungrily . <p> Firefighters and police showed up in time to save the Pollux . Distorted figures in half-recognized uniforms sprayed water on the ancient movie palace . It bothered me that I could n't smell the smoke or feel the heat of the fire . Even with all the hustle and bustle , the heartbeats of the humans responding to the emergency did not echo in my ears . Instead , their voices were muted and far away . <p> I stared at the fire engine . They had parked it in the middle of the street , right over the spot where my former best friend Roger had been eaten by werewolves . I saw a flash of him in my mind 's eye , reduced to a skeleton , still screaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I felt a pang of guilt for siccing them on Roger , even though he 'd betrayed me , but it was a brief pang . Intellectually , I knew he had n't really been my friend . <p> For the last forty years Roger had plotted my downfall , but with my memory functioning properly , it was hard not to hear his screams echoing through my brain . Worse , though , were the memories of Marilyn , watching as the explosion ripped through her , seeing her die ... Her death had been Roger 's parting birthday present to me . What a pal . <p> At least Tabitha had n't been at the club when it had happened . If there 's a good time to ditch your boyfriend , I 'd say right before he gets incinerated is a good pick . So , kudos to her for timing . <p> " It 's all so eerily beautiful , " said a voice . Marilyn was standing next to me . Young again , red hair hanging down past her shoulders , she sported the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd carried in my wallet before it got torched with the rest of me . If Ann-Margret or Maureen O'Hara had been blessed with more attractive younger sisters , they might have looked almost as sensational as my Marilyn . She 'd been the bait for the trap Roger had set for me . I had to give him high marks for effectiveness there . Picking the love of my life ( if not the love of my death ) to lure me to my final destruction was primo angst material . <p> " Like a Van Gogh painting , " Marilyn continued . " The Starry Night or The CafT Terrace on the Place du Forum , Arles , at Night . " <p> " ' Starry , Starry Night ' is an old Don McLean song right ? " <p> Marilyn laughed . " That song 's called ' Vincent , ' but ' Starry Night ' is in the chorus . " <p> I was born in 1926 and Marilyn was a few years my senior . When I turned into a vampire , she stayed human , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched her age for over forty years . I had missed her so much without even realizing it . The person she had become , the one who was old and sick and smoked too much , bore almost no resemblance to the Marilyn I remembered , the one who was here now . <p> " I 'm sorry , " she said softly . " I am so sorry , Eric . " <p> Ghosts , as it turns out , can hug one another . I took her in my arms , crushed her to my chest . We probably looked like long-lost lovers in some old black-and-white movie , but given our ages , I guess that should n't have come as a big surprise . Her breasts pressed against me , without warmth . It did n't matter . I covered her with kisses and she laughed again , despite herself , before she pulled away . <p> " What is it ? " I asked . <p> " I need to tell you something . " I did n't need an orchestral cue to know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She could stare down an angry vampire , blow smoke in his face , and laugh when he snarled . I could n't count the number of times she 'd done exactly that ... to me . I had never seen her so scared . <p> " Tell me , " I said . " Look . It 's okay . I mean , we may be forced to haunt the remains of a strip club for eternity , unless our bus is just late or something , but I do n't see how this is your fault . " <p> Shaking her head , she walked away from me , passing unthinkingly through a firefighter . <p> " I 'm not staying , " she said . " I can feel it "  --  she placed her hand over her bosom  --  " inside . I just ... I have to tell you something before I ... go . " <p> Go ? Going sounded like a bad idea . Marilyn walked back and put her arms around me . " I did n't know about it , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and horrified , and when you rose , I knew that I could n't go through with it . So he ... " <p> A babbling Marilyn was an even bigger warning sign . My girl did n't babble . She did n't mince words , and she sure as hell did n't let her words trail off into nothingness . <p> " When I rose ... as a vampire ? " <p> As far as I knew , I 'd died in a car wreck . Coming back as a vampire had surprised me as much as it had anyone else . When I rose , it was two weeks after the crash at two in the afternoon on the day Marilyn and I were supposed to have been wed . " Am I late for something ? " I 'd asked her before bursting into flames . The look in her ghostly eyes , there in the remains of my club , was the same as the look she 'd had back then standing over my grave . And I was afraid of that look , that **128;748;TOOLONG  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not want to know . Call me King Avoidance . I have a sixth sense for things I do n't want to know and her manner pegged this as top of the scale ignorance-is-bliss material . Her confession or revelation or whatever was best left unsaid , best taken into the grave and left there . All the bad ones are . <p> No one wants to hear that you never really loved them , that it was you who ran over their pet dog , that you forgot to pull out , or that you actually did nail your secretary that one time in New York when you claimed you were in separate rooms . <p> You 've got to understand ... being blown up was not the most traumatic thing that has happened to me lately . When it turned out Roger was behind all the attempts on my unlife , the one who set me up to fight the werewolves , the one who tried to spike my blood supply ... I had n't wanted to know that , either , would have given almost anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cover it all up without my ever knowing . That way I 'd still have been able to think he was my friend . I 'd have preferred the lie . <p> Marilyn 's eyes told me I 'd prefer a lie in her case , too . Any secret that had stayed buried that long did n't need exhuming . She opened her mouth to tell me , but I could n't let her finish that sentence . I was n't ready for her to move on , so I kissed her . <p> She kissed me back  --  not a passionate kiss , but the tender intimacy of two people who have grown old together and accepted the best and the worst in each other . <p> It might have been more romantic if that fat policeman had n't stepped through us . A bed would have been nice , too . If we could touch , I was pretty sure we could do other things . For forty years I had craved her touch . To make love one last time would have been a kindness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kiss and there was no second one . <p> Marilyn took my hand and led me over to a bench in the little glassed-in bus stop where my bouncers would leave guys who 'd had one too many . " I missed you so much , " I told her . <p> " I 've been with you for half a century , Eric . " She scowled . <p> " You know what I mean , " I said sheepishly . I gestured to her body . " Not like this , not in the same way . " <p> Her expression softened . " That ought to make me angry , but it does n't . I always find it hard to be mad at you for long . " <p> " Brain damage , " I responded . <p> She almost laughed . It literally rose and fell dead in her throat . The laughter could n't escape whatever was bothering her . <p> " Do n't joke , " she said sharply . " Do n't be so much like your old self . It makes everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be too hard , " I said briskly , rushing through the words , running them together . " If not telling me will keep you here with me , then do n't tell me . I 'd rather not know . " <p> " You really need to know this , Eric . I 'm sorry . " She looked at me , expecting a response . <p> " No , you are n't , " I told her . " You do n't have to say anything , but if your mind 's made up ... I 've never been able to unmake it . " <p> " Do you remember what happened when you died ? " she asked . <p> " I was driving Roger 's car , the brakes went out , blah , blah , blah . What are you going to tell me , that you sabotaged the brakes because you did n't want to marry me ? " <p> " Roger did , " she spat out quickly . <p> I froze . If I 'd been in a cartoon , the angel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just been gut shot by the devil representing my bad side . <p> " He wanted me to marry him , " she continued . " Roger and I had been seeing each other for months , and I did n't know how to tell you  --  " <p> I got up and walked off toward the Pollux , leaving Marilyn still sitting on the bus stop bench . Two of the firemen pointed at the enclosure . Its rear window froze and shattered as I passed through it . I did n't know why it happened . I assumed it was part of whatever ghost powers I 'd wound up with , but I did n't give a damn , not then . <p> " Eric , " she called after me . " Wait ! You need to hear this . " <p> " Actually , I do n't . " My voice was calm , but I was n't . " I was murdered by my best friend and my fiancTe ? " I scoffed . " Nope , did n't need to know that . What , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sucks to be you ? " <p> " No , Eric . " She chased after me . I stopped just shy of the middle of the road , did n't turn to face her . " It was n't like that . I had nothing to do with it . When they called me and told me you were dead ... I called Roger and he already knew . I went over to his house and he told me what he had done to you and then he showed me what he had let someone do to him . " <p> " He 'd become a vampire , " I said flatly . <p> " He said that it had happened three weeks earlier when he 'd driven over to Chicago for that conference . He 'd met a woman from Atlanta ... a woman named Gabriella ... " <p> " A woman who was really a vampire , and then she turned him . " I shook my head , rounding slowly toward Marilyn . " Well , that 's just so fucking cute I could puke . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I did , I had a brief glimpse of Carl 's garage , of my Mustang . I loved that car , an artifact from my living days , a 1964 1/2 convertible . I 'd wrecked it three days before , but Carl was doing a great job on the repairs . Why I saw it in my mind then , I could n't say . It was weird . <p> " I told him to get away from me . " Marilyn touched my shoulder , then pulled away as if she 'd been stung . " I ran from the house , but he caught me .... He pushed himself inside my mind and touched my thoughts . He left something there . He smeared blood on my skin , willed it into a tattoo , a little frog . He said that if I would n't join him willingly then I would be his human slave , his thrall . " <p> Thrall . I had one of those . Rachel , my ex-girlfriend 's little sister , had damn near forced me to make her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marilyn described the process , it sounded pretty familiar , except I had n't given Rachel any kind of tattoo , blood or otherwise , and Rachel sure as hell was n't my slave . As far as I knew , thralldom granted the mortal participant protection from other vampires , marked them as protected . It also widened a vampire 's senses , allowing them to detect the thralls of other vampires while simultaneously allowing the vampire to sense the location of their vampiric offspring . <p> " Why did n't you say anything ? " I demanded , turning back to face her . <p> " He would n't let me . When you rose and you were stronger than him , he was n't sure what to do . He 'd made me his thrall , and every time I tried to talk about it , the words just would n't come out . He 'd specifically forbidden me to tell you . " <p> I cursed aloud and saw another glimpse of my car . Ignoring the automotive strangeness , I grabbed the front of her jacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What the fuck good does this do me now ? Did you tell me just to make yourself feel better ? To drive me out of my freakin ' mind so my crazy-ass ghost can haunt the Demon Heart ? " <p> " He 's been afraid of you for years , Eric , too afraid to kill you , and too afraid to really do anything to me when you were around . " <p> " When I was around ? What about when I was n't around ? " I yelled . " What then ? " <p> " I think you already know the answer to that , " she told me , resignation clear in her voice . And I guess she was right , at that . <p> " I 'm so glad Willie and his werewolves ate that motherfucker , " I ranted . <p> " That 's why I had to tell you , " she sobbed . Marilyn tried to put her arms around me , but all the love-struck puppy had gone out of me and I pushed her away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her . " Good ! Be mad at me , Eric , as angry as you want , but you have to hear this . You may think you know how devious Roger was , but he 's worse . I ca n't believe I ever thought about leaving you for him ! He had some kind of plan to steal your power , to become whatever it is that you are . You 're not a normal Vlad . At first Roger did n't believe it , but all the things he did to you , they were part of a test , to convince him , to prove what you were ... are . " <p> I looked back at her and she was n't crying . The cadence of her words was increasing , trying to beat the clock . She sounded as if her time was running out , the commercial was almost over and she had to get the rest of her message out before she returned to regularly scheduled programming . " Last night , when I was tied to the chair , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare , a king of kings , an emperor . " <p> " Emperor ? " I scoffed . <p> " It has something to do with why your eyes are still blue , why you never went through postmortem syndrome . She said it 's like your transformation stopped just before it was finished , and in that gray area , not alive , not dead , and yet not entirely undead , there is a lot of power to be had . " In retrospect I should have asked her who the " she " in that sentence was , but I was too caught up in thoughts of Marilyn and Roger to think very clearly . <p> " Well , la de fucking dah , Marilyn . " I tossed up my hands . " What the hell good does that do me now ? " <p> " Because Roger had a backup plan . I do n't know what it was , but he was working with ... " She clawed at her throat , eyes ablaze with terror . " Oh , God ... " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tried to help , but my hand passed through her shoulder . <p> " Marilyn ! " <p> Her mouth opened wide in a silent scream , and then it grabbed her . I did n't know what it was , at first , and then my memories of El Segundo washed over me in a wave . I 'd never been on fire so many times in one weekend . El Segundo was where I 'd met Talbot , and where I 'd met my first demon . Being in the presence of a demon had never bothered me when I 'd been a vampire . Now that I was a ghost , its presence burned . <p> Fear ripped through me , tore at my ectoplasmic brain with tiny meat hooks . A swirling cloud of Marilyn screeched through the air toward its open mouth , her ghostly essence both compressed and stretched , converting her into an unrecognizable blue smoke funnel  --  a hellish I Dream of Jeannie moment . But this was a demon , not a bottle , and that was Marilyn , not Barbara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my spirit eyes , the demon was an outline , a hole of blackness in the air . Marilyn , what was left of her , vanished into that void . <p> The presence turned its attention to me . " Do I know you , revenant ? " it asked . <p> " Give her back ! " I charged the demon , certain that I might get sucked into the same vortex , but not giving a damn . Fighting is one thing I 'm never afraid of . My hands passed through the creature with no effect . Ghosts ca n't harm demons , I guessed . <p> The demon let loose with a series of loud whinnies combined with the sound of a machine crushing ice . It could have been laughter . " Her soul was promised to me , angry one . It is my due for services rendered . " <p> " Let her go . " <p> " I have a contract . " The demon moved closer . Supernatural panic forced me to my knees like a two-ton bouncer . The power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my face , but I refused to go all the way down . A Mustang 's engine roared to life somewhere far away . Beneath me frost formed on the asphalt . <p> Cops and firefighters screamed . I do n't know if they saw me or the demon , but most of them ran . One of them was too close . His life called to me , not like blood , but warmth . The ground rushed up to meet him as his soul tore free and surged into me . The frost on the ground spiraled out from my phantom knees , crusting thickly on the man-made surface . <p> " Give her back ! " Nourished by the firefighter 's soul , I forced myself to my feet . His spirit coursed through me , the sensation not unlike the feeling of warmth and fullness I got when , as a vampire , I 'd made a fresh kill . Powers , I thought to myself . If I 'm a ghost , then I have ghost powers , like freezing the window , breaking it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " An arrangement might be reached , " the demon purred . He sounded mildly impressed . If he was giving in , willing to deal , then it was likely I could hurt him . I just needed to figure out how . " An exchange , " the demon continued . " You for her ? " <p> " An old friend of mine warned me about deals like that , " I growled . " He said that demons always cheat . " <p> " No prevarication has ever taken place on my part , I assure you , but I do obey the letter of the agreement . It is true that many do not "  --  he paused  --  " think through contracts as carefully as they should . <p> " Marilyn made her deal . The agreement was reached under compulsion from her vampiric master , but the signature is hers . Her soul in exchange for an ... intercession . " The demon moved back , its edges bleeding into its surroundings . " I believe I have a viable substitute , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up Ms. Robinson 's soul . I 'll hang onto her for now , shall I ? I hope we meet again , angry ghost . But having collected this lady 's soul , I now have other duties to perform , including the intercession of which I spoke . " <p> I lunged for him again , but when I crossed the white line in the middle of the road , I flew apart , my essence bursting into countless little particles of self , the world blurring even more than before . Everything went silent , then dark , until I re-formed , standing in the spot where the bomb had gone off . Nice ! Not only was I a ghost , I was a ghost with a short leash.Copyright 2009 by Jeremy F. Lewis <br> Continues ...
