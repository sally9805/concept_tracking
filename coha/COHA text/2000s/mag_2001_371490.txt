Robert Cochran knows a great idea when he hears one . So when his production partner Joel Surnow called him with a brainstorm  --  " a show , 24 episodes , the whole season takes place in one day , each episode is an hour of real time "  --  Cochran responded as many a seasoned producer might have . " I said , ' That 's brilliant . But it 's impossible , ' " he recalls . " ' I do n't want to think about it . Do n't ever say that to me again . ' " <P> Surnow did bring it up again , and finally the two ( who teamed up for USA 's La Femme Nikita ) worked backward to write a story that would justify the gimmick . Starting at midnight , counterterrorist agent Jack Bauer ( Kiefer Sutherland ) has 24 hours to foil an attempt to assassinate Senator David Palmer ( Dennis Haysbert ) , who is about to become the first major African-American nominee for President . People in Bauer 's agency may be in on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his teenage daughter ( Elisha Cuthbert ) is AWOL in a van with two skeevy-seeming young men . At the end of the pilot , it 's 1 a.m. , and he does n't know where his daughter or the killer is . " If you lay all this on one guy , " says Cochran , " he wo n't be getting any sleep , and hopefully the audience wo n't either . " <P> Forget sleeping through this one  --  you wo n't even want to blink . 24 ( Fox , Tuesdays , 9 p.m . E.T. ) is the most distinctive , addictive new TV series this season . As an old-fashioned thriller , it 's relentless , tense and deliciously paranoiac , with more twists than a Twizzler . But it 's also boldly different . Most notably , there 's its clever visual signature : picture-in-picture screens that show two , three and even four different scenes simultaneously . Director and executive producer Stephen Hopkins first used the device to handle the show 's many phone calls , but it proved the perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is something going on at every moment , " Hopkins says . " We wanted to show the connection between people and each one in their own environment . " Like Web pages or the headline " crawls " on cable-news screens , the device is a visual metaphor for busyness , implying that the program is too bursting with action for one screen to contain . It 's drama for the age of information overload . <P> 24 , in other words , is 21st century TV . Therein lie its pleasures and its risks . The real-time concept is a dramatic answer to reality TV 's aesthetic of immediacy and edge . ( Next year NBC will air a real-time Julia Louis-Dreyfus sitcom , tentatively titled 23:12 for the average length of a sitcom minus ads . ) But the format is a pain to pull off . The tight time frame means the first few episodes cement choices that will be hard to reverse if the creators have second thoughts . " We had to lay out a map , literally , of where people were at what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If somebody 's 45 minutes from somebody , you ca n't just cut to the next scene and they 're there . " On the plus side , the costume designer 's job is a breeze .
