SOMEONE WAS DYING . Deborah felt it in her chest . She felt it along her spine . She felt it , though she could not have explained how , in her womb . The feeling stirred her out of half sleep . She opened her eyes . The shades were drawn but a blue light had begun to seep in around the edges . It was 6 a.m . Now would be a good time to hear a voice . She would like to have been called . Deborah ! Deborah ! But it no longer happened that way , if it ever had . Deborah smiled at herself for a childhood fantasy that had never left her . The window glowed . She heard the flop of The New York Times against her front door . The newspaper delivery boyactually a middle-aged black woman ; Deborah had spied on her once through the peepholestood in the open elevator and flung the papers , as if dealing a giant pack of cards . After a sleepless night Deborah found the sound reassuring , a town crier 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there had been a lot of sleepless nights . The strange sensation darkened her again , an inner shadow . Someone was dying . She tried to think who it might be . William who had emphysema and could n't talk but whose hand she often held . The old woman on the eighth floor nobody came to see who had given her a recipe for sponge cake . Frank the trumpet player with AIDS for whom the complex cocktail no longer worked . That poor baby in the neonatal ICU , baby Emily the nurses called her , who had been born with a hole in her heart.Deborah shuddered at the memory of the tiny blue child . Angry Caroline with ovarian cancer , scarcely older than she herself was . That might explain the strange sympathetic sensation nestled in her own belly . She rested a hand there but her body told her nothing . Somehow , she did n't think it was any of these . Of course , someone was always dying . It did n't have to be someone you knew . Visiting a hospital regularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cup of coffee and start the day . The newspaper was waiting for her . Reuben , when they had been together , all but heard the Times crying on the doorstep like an abandoned child . He would bring it into bed . Deborah could never look at the paper first thing in the morning . Though she was keenly attuned to the world 's sorrows , internal matters always concerned her more . Deborah decided to pray . She had promised herself that she would pray more regularly . She rose and stretched . She was wearing a T-shirt and nothing else . She stepped into a pair of underpants . It did n't seem right to stand bare-assed before God , though of course everyone was supposed to be naked before Him . Not that she thought of God as a seeing presence . Or a Him . Still , she slipped on a pair of red running shorts over the underpants . Barefoot , she padded across the wood floor and removed a large zippered velvet envelope from her top drawer . She left a smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the air conditioner . It had been in the high eighties the past few days but Deborah hated the artificial cool . There was something dishonest about it , though this was the kind of observation that drove Reubenwho had bought the air conditioner for hercrazy . She always imagined that the heat was still lurking somewhere in the room , hidden behind an invisible veil of refrigerated air . If you exerted yourself only slightly you felt hot and realized that the whole thing was a kind of physical illusion . This belief was , in Reuben 's words , a pantheistic delusion . But Reuben was gone , though his machine lived on , sucking life out of the room in his absence . Deborah 's grandfather had been surprisingly tall ; she was reminded of this as she unfurled his large prayer shawl , ivory white with bold zebra stripes of black . Though she was five foot six inches tall , when she raised the shawl over her head she was completely shrouded . She loved the feeling of being wrapped , hidden away inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meditation she now recited , God was described as robed in light . Deborah held the ends of the prayer shawl together above her head and felt , for a moment , blissfully cocooned . When Reuben had seen her in her tallis for the first time he had called her a transvestite . Remembering it now , she burned with shame and indignation . He had pretended it was a joke and flashed her his gleaming , bearded smile , but she could see the disgust in his eyes . He had nothing against women praying , he told her , but why did they have to pray dressed like men ? Reuben was Orthodox . Of course he had slept with her anywaynot , she felt sure , the only one of the 613 commandments he had violated , but perhaps the one he most easily discounted . He had shown more anxiety about the state of her kitchenthe morning after , she 'd found him sifting through the silverware to make sure that she indeed had a set for milk and a set for meat . Deborah lowered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind her slender neck ; she gathered up the extra material on either side and threw it over her shoulders , doubling the great square of striped cloth back on itself so that she wore it like a cape . The tassels hung down in front and behind . It annoyed her to be thinking of Reuben now , in her moment of prayer , with his ortho-arrogant awkwardness , his air of entitlement and insecurity . Modern Orthodox men were macho sissies . He was n't the first one she 'd dated . They expected to inherit the earth but they had a nagging , inborn fear that they might be driven from it first . In this respect they were n't quite American , and Deborah supposed it was this mild foreignness , coupled with her own weakness for ritual rigor , that had drawn her to them in the first place . She had met Reuben in his synagogue , not hers . She herself must have held a certain exotic appeal for hima Reform woman rabbi . She must not have seemed quite American either , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed a substitute for the inner state . Did she have a Reform soul ? She did n't feel that way , especially draped in her grandfather 's tallis . Reuben can kiss my Reform rabbinical cross-dressing ass . She hurled herself into Ma TovuHow goodly are your tents , oh Jacobher heart pounding , trying to recapture the tented pleasure of the moment before . But it was n't until she had blazed through Adon Olam and Yigdalcontaining Maimonides 's thirteen principles of Judaism , beginning with the existence of God and ending with the resurrection of the deadthat she settled down . Deborah loved the praise part of prayer . In rabbinic school there had always been students who wrestled with praise and took a **30;262;TOOLONG attitude toward God , an attitude of human entitlement and anger . Deborah had never understood this . To praise God made her feel whole and she recited Birkot Hashachar with a schoolgirl 's relish : Blessed are you God who gives sight to the blind ; blessed are you God who clothes the naked ; blessed are you God who did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's little prayer book , which made no apologies for blessed are you God who did not make me a woman . Deborah skipped that blessing and recited the female alternative , Blessed are you God who made me according to his will . She found her groove and raced along , fast but focused , gathering the four tassels of her tallis in her right hand when she came to the " Shema and her Blessings " so that she could kiss them every time she uttered the word tzitzitAnd you shall look on them and remember the commandments , and not be seduced by the desires of the heart of the eye . . . By the time she got to the Amida she had forgotten the distress of the morning and was moving smoothly along ancient verbal tracks of praise and petition . One of her liturgy professors had spoken of prayer in the language of sports . You break through the wall , he said , and you 're no longer thinking , I 'm running , I 'm running , you 're simply running . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She entered the Amida almost before she knew it , bowing and bending and feeling the words alive inside her . But then the persistent whisper in her blood distracted her . Again she thought , Someone is dying . Was it the hospital getting to her at last ? Her sister , Rachel , had been telling her that she spent too much time there , which , considering the fact that Rachel was a doctor , was laughable . Though she was spending more and more of her time among the sick . She 'd begun visiting congregants but had found herself spending time with other patients , too , Jews and non-Jews , old people and babies alike . Rabbi Zwieback , the senior rabbi , was only too happy to give her hospital detail , and for the past two years half her salary was paid by a grant that supported ministering to the sick . Deborah had found in the hospital an air of truthfulness and , strange to say , vitality , that she could not account for . She sometimes felt the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonishment that he likes war . That in the thick of battlebullets whizzing around his head , comrades falling , death undeniable , life its brightest and most immediate and most perishablehis inner state has finally found its outer expression . In the hospital Deborah found not fear but , oddly , a kind of peace . Not that she had abandoned her other responsibilities . This very Sunday she would be performing a wedding . Now that was scary . Deborah had met with the couple twice and it seemed clear they were n't ready for marriage . Janet was only twenty-four and had already broken off the engagement once , during which time she had briefly returned to an earlier , non-Jewish boyfriend . Deborah felt this woman was still torn but , a pleaser by nature , she had reconciled because she could not bear to assert herself in a lasting way . Deborah had heard only a tiny piece of this story from Janet when they had spoken on the phone and had imagined she would learn more , but with her fianc beside her the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax attorney ( Deborah tried not to hold his profession or his goatee against him ) did most of the talking , and he did it in a controlling way Deborah resented . " We 've had some times " Rick had said , " but we 've worked through them . We 're ready to make the leap . " He kept on talking without pause , about what kind of service they wanted and about his father who had died and about how Janet 's sister would be playing the flute . He left Deborah no opening so she had cut him off abruptly . " Have the invitations already gone out ? " she 'd asked , more harshly than she 'd intended . Tact was never her strong suit and when she was agitated or annoyed it went out the window . Man and wife-to-be had both looked at her in surprise . But she had persistedshe blushed at the memory of it . " I understand there have been some problems with . . . fidelity . " At last Rick , waking from his stupor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therapists . We 're not looking for another one . " No , dickhead , Deborah thought , you want a spiritual caterer to hand you your wedding on a tray . But she retreated . Janet had given her no support , saying only , " We 're very comfortable now , " several times . Comfortable ? Deborah had wanted to scream : Do you love him ? What about that other guy ? Do n't use religion as an excuse . Marry for love ! But she had held her tongue . They did seem comfortable . It was she herself who was n't comfortable these days . Weddings had become difficult . As a rule she loved them , standing at the center of the white ceremony , a figure of almost magical authority , braiding two lives together . The Talmud said the world was a wedding . But was it one for her ? She was thirty and single . She felt more profoundly alone than she ever had in her life . Deborah caught sight of herself in the full-length mirror on the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's prayer shawl . Her bare legs came out the bottom . She should shave them before the wedding . Still , they were nice legs , though slightly knock-kneed . She adjusted her stance and almost turned to see her behind in the mirror but caught herself . She realized to her astonishment that she was still praying , her lips on automatic . She was impressed with herself and perturbed at the same time . So she knew the Amida by heart ! Or at least her lips did . This did not altogether gratify her . When she swam laps she believed that if her mind wandered too much , she was n't really exercising . It was one thing to break through the wallit was another thing to leave the building . She drove her mind back to the prayers . Oh Lord , guard my lips from speaking falsehood and my tongue from speaking guile . . . Let my soul be as dust before you . She finished the Amida , took three steps backward , turned her body to the left and right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the absence of air-conditioning , had begun to grow warm . Deborah yawned . " Dear God , forgive my distractions , " she murmured . More and more she was given to spontaneous prayer , something she had picked up in the hospital from a Baptist minister . There was no danger of your mind wandering when you spoke directly to God . The ice broken , she added , " Please do n't let me be alone . " Was she praying for a man now ? Or was it God she wanted ? She sensed the mysterious presence again in the room . A sort of tiptoeing shadow . She often her father , dead now fifteen years , with her , but that was a kind of inner glow . This felt different , stranger . God ? The Angel of Death ? Or only her overactive imagination ? She did not really believe in God as a physical being and yet she knew , too , that if a voice called out to her she would answer , without hesitation , " Here I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always happening , and , what is more , on the verge of happening . She was constantly encountering , if not God , then at least the outer garment of God . A few days before , she had seen an elderly man on Broadway , copper bearded and stooped but neatly dressed in a seersucker suit , swaying over his own untied shoelaces . He was wearing running shoes , an incongruous but not uncommon fashion choice for Upper West Side elderly . The laces of both shoes were untied and he seemed incapable of bending over enough to get to them or of deciding which shoe to tie first . Without asking permission , Deborah had knelt down and tied them both . The humble gesture had flooded her with joy . It was the joy of kneeling down , erasing herself for a moment in an act of kindness . She 'd felt astonishingly alive at that instant , as if she had been created for just such a purpose . Deborah was no longer praying . Her mind was merely wandering . " Sorry , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Talking to yourself ? she thought , and then quickly added , Or are You there ? Deborah smiled inwardly . Are you There God ? It 's Me , Margaret had been one of her favorite books when she was eleven . After four years of a very good college , five years of seminary , two and a half years as an assistant rabbi , after reading Maimonides and Kierkegaard and Heschel and Buber , had she come no further ? But why be embarrassedthe psalmist himself asked such questions ; he simply put them more gracefully . Oh Lord , how long will you turn your face from me ? Oh Lord , answer me . Are you there , God ? It 's me , King David . Deborah began to sing a verse of Psalm 116 . It was not the prescribed psalm for that day but by this time she had given up on the prayer book . Psalm 116 was one of her favoritesshe recited it often with patients in the hospital and the most stirring of its verses had been set to music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Deborah had a beautiful voice and loved to sing . She swayed as she sang , her soft , pure voice filling the room and soothing her . Her mind felt free again . Tears came to her eyesnot tears of sadness , precisely , but something deeper and at the same time less personal than ordinary sadness . They were tears of an unknown emotion , an unfathomable longing . They were tears of prayer . Deborah cried a lot , in many situations . It did n't bother her , though Rabbi Zwieback still looked at her in alarm when , midway through a service , she would stand up to announce a page number , her cheeks shining . The prayer shawl slipped off one shoulder and hung over her like a toga , but Deborah did n't notice . She had shut her grandmother 's little prayer book and held it against her breast as she sang , in Hebrew , her eyes closed swaying . Answer me , Lord , answer me , for I am your servant , the son of your handmaid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . She had never cared about making prayers gender neutral . The soul knew no gender . The words were intended for her . She wished to be God 's Servant . She felt a keen , delicious ache in her heart as she sang the verse over and over , lulling herself with the words and music . She stood in the warmth of the brightening room , swaying and singing . Answer me , God . Answer me.
