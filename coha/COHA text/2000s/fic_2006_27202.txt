Chapter One My " Gift " It was n't easy having two mothers . Selene , who 'd given me life , was small , dark , feminine as a fan . The other , her tall , tawny lion of a cousin , Agrippina , was granddaughter of the Divine Augustus . My father was second in command under Agrippina 's husband , Germanicus , commander in chief of the Rhine armies and rightful heir to the Empire . Growing up in one army camp after another , my sister , Marcella , and I were often in Agrippina 's home , treated as her own . She favored her sons , but their time was given over to trainers who drilled them daily in the use of sword and spear , shield and ax . We girls remained clay for her to mold . When I was ten , the ceaseless chatter of the older girls bored me . " Which officer is handsomest ? " " What stola the most alluring ? " Who cared ! I was reading Sappho when Agrippina swept the scroll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light , she admired my profile . " Your nose is pure patrician , but that hair ! " Agrippina grabbed a gold comb from the table , swept my hair this way and that . Then , as I sat rigid under her restraining hand , she began to cut . Slaves scurried to brush away the thick unruly curls fallen to the floor . " Ah , this is much better . Hold the mirror up higher , " she instructed Marcella . " Let her see the back , the sides . " Agrippina was always full ofideas , so sure she knew best . I glanced at Marcella , who nodded her approval . The wild hair had been tamed-thinned , pulled back , and bound by a fillet so that my curls cascaded like a waterfall . Agrippina scrutinized me carefully . " You 're really quite pretty-not a beauty like Marcella here , but who knows . " She glanced again at my sister . " You 're a rose-no doubt about it-but Claudia ... let me think . Who is Claudia ?

This is your color ; wear it always . " Wear it always ! Agrippina was so imperious . Her enthusiasm overwhelmed me . It infuriated Mother . " Those were your baby curls ! " she stormed angrily when I came home laden with purple tunics , flowers , scarves , and ribbons . And so it went between them , with me always in the middle . Still , to this day , I favor purple and take pride in my profile . People who felt entitled , even obligated , to impose their wills on me were everywhere . Tata and Mother , of course , but also Germanicus and Agrippina-I called them aunt and uncle . My sister , Marcella , two years older , expected to dominate me , as did our rich cousins , Julia and Druscilla , and their brothers , Drusus , Nero , and Caligula . Caligula missed no opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tongue in my ear and only laughed when I smacked him . Small wonder I coveted my own company . Perhaps it was from these quiet times that the sight came . At an early age , I often knew of a visitor 's approach before a slave announced the arrival . It happened so naturally that I wondered why others were surprised or even suspicious , imagining that I played a joke . Because the knowledge was trivial and rarely benefited me , I thought little of it . My dreams were different . They began when we were stationed in Monokos , a small town on the southwest coast of Gaul . For a time it seemed that I could scarcely close my eyes without a vision of some sort overtaking me . They were fragmented dreams . I remembered little and understood less , yet awakened always with a chilling sense of impending danger . The frequency and intensity of these nighttime visions increased ; I feared to sleep , forced myself to lie awake late into the night . Then , in my tenth year , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten it or the events that followed . I saw myself in a wooded wilderness , a fearful place , thick , dark , almost black . Wet leaves scraped across my face as I breathed the damp smell of decay , shivering miserably in the cold . I struggled to free myself but could not ; the dream held me prisoner in its thrall . All about me strange and fearful men chanted words I could not understand . As they crowded forward , surrounding me , I saw that they were dressed as legionnaires , but unlike the soldiers in our garrison , their faces were hardened by anger and bitterness . A huge , fearsome man with pockmarked skin came forward , a young wolf trotting companionably at his heels . This awful person urged the others to violence . Answering cries echoed through the dark forest . He grabbed a sword and lunged toward the wolf who sat trustingly at his feet . With one swift stroke , he impaled the unsuspecting creature . The wolf screamed horribly or was it I who shrieked ? In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncle . It was dear Germanicus who lay dying at my feet . Though Tata and Mother rushed in to comfort me , I could n't banish the ugly picture from my mind . " Someone wants to kill Uncle Germanicus , " I gasped . " You have to save him . " " Tomorrow , love , we 'll speak of it tomorrow , " Tata promised , stroking me tenderly , but the morning 's talk was brief . My parents agreed : a child 's nightmare scarcely warranted bothering the commander in chief . Two days later when a messenger brought word of a threatened mutiny in Germania , I saw them exchange troubled glances . My retreat in those days was a secluded corner of beach obscured by rocks . I went there alone , waded in tide pools where no one saw me but the tiny sea creatures I called my own . This is where Germanicus found me . Dropping down on a rock , eyes level with my own , he spoke . " I understand we have a seer in our midst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't important . " ( Continues ... )
