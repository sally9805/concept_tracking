We found the kittens in a pile , too young to even stagger , the mother too hungry herself to feed them , or caught by the dogs . We had a big old plastic purse with a blanket inside , and we put them all in there and hauled them around in the wagon . I liked them , they were a little town of their own , part of our gang to defend against the Polish kids that lived right next to the tracks , or the Irish kids in the houses down by the river . Gang warfare , but our gang was only us . We boys kept our pockets full of rocks , small ones to chuck at the dogs . Now and then the City would clean the stray dogs out of the rail yard , put out poisoned meat . We 'd see carcasses dropped in the ditch round back of the tracks , like the dogs crawled there on purpose when they knew something was wrong . Some City worker emptied bags of lime over them , shaking the bags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sleep dust for the dogs . We 'd see him , and he 'd shoo us away , angry , like we 'd caught him at murder . But it was just a benediction , like Father Salvadore gave in the shape of the cross after services . Grass grew up over the dogs , high and green , till they were only bones , and the rangy pups who 'd survived were big enough to slink after us , compete with the cats for mice and rats , hunt the cats . Those dogs ' faces were so scarred they looked painted in thin white lines . <p> I was a murderer myself . The first time , my dad made me , showed me how . He put that passel of kittens we brought home into a burlap sack like they pour wood pulp into at the sawmill . He made me hold it open and put in the rocks . The rocks were heavy , and I put them under the kittens , like a hard bed . The kittens were so young they barely had their eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in some of the soft rags we kept around for washing cars or cleaning motors , wiping oily grime off carburetors . Even then , we had a car that worked and a car that did n't , for fooling with . My dad told me it was fine to cushion the rocks , and I could let these kittens go a few blocks away , but they 'd die of starvation or something would kill them , and they would suffer . If I brought them back here , he said , or any other passel of animals so young he could n't chase them off , we 'd have to do all this again , and he 'd personally escort me to the riverbank and watch me throw in the bag . Rule one , he said , you do n't make a baby and then leave it , unless you 're dead yourself . Plenty around here might have been taught this simple rule . That was about all he ever said about my mother . Or any of the other fathers and mothers missing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that seemed honorable . Other people should take care of what he was forced to leave , no matter how hard that might be . Here I 'd intervened in something , my dad said , and I should be a man and finish it . He struggled to keep us fed and clothed . No one was going to bottle-feed these kittens and find them homes over on Fairmont Hill , where the rich people kept their cats indoors and fed them out of cans . He was right . Where we lived on the alley , so close to the rail yard , people thought cats were diseased vermin , and they shot them and chased them and kicked them . This was the cleanest and strongest those kittens were ever going to be . <p> So I took them to the riverbank , to the tunnel under the rail bridge . I put the bag on the ground , and I could see the kittens shifting around in the burlap and hear them mewling . They sounded loud in the tunnel , where the air was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church . We kids always went there , but I 'd never been there alone . It was deep and shady under the rail bridge in the summer , with the river beside , and you could watch the trains overhead sometimes and see them cross the river . Trains came barreling across from the rail yard over us . Just at the midpoint , a stone support of the same thick rock stood up in the deepest water of the river . It was built to look like the tunnel bridges on either side , but it was only half as big , and bore the most stress . It stood out of the water like a man with a massive weight on his shoulders . As a train reached it , I had to fight not to hold my breath , then the train streaked across to the other side and filled the entire span before it lost itself around the bend of the hill . At dusk you could see town lights come on up and down the riverbank , but the other bank was darkness and trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of the river , not far from the central support of the bridge . Might have been slag at one time because it was treeless , but the river had risen and fallen over it enough times to deposit a rich layer of sediment . The island was green every summer with grass and flowering weeds and brush that died back in winter . Deer swam out to it from the other side of the river . You could see them plain if they were standing on top of the mound , one or two or three of them . They 'd look up when a train passed , then fall to grazing again , safe from whatever hunted them in the woods . <p> It was quiet that day . There were no trains . Even the kittens had got quiet . They must have fallen asleep on those soft rags , all curled up into one another . There was n't a sound when I put them in the water . <p> After that I would n't let anyone take kittens from the rail yard until they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them loose by the river where there were toads and minnows and mice and lizards . They could take their own chances . Death was not the bad thing . Leaving something behind when you gave up or walked away was the bad thing . <p>
