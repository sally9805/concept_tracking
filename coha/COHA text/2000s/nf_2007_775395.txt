THE LUCKIEST GUY IN THE WORLD // I 'm going to tell you a story you 've never heard before , because no one knows this story the way I know it . It takes place on the night of June 12 , 1994 , and it concerns the murder of my ex-wife , Nicole Brown Simpson , and her young friend , Ronald Goldman . I want you to forget everything you think you know about that night , because I know the facts better than anyone . I know the players . I 've seen the evidence . I 've heard the theories . And , of course , I 've read all the stories : That I did it . That I did it but I do n't know I did it . That I can no longer tell fact from fiction . That I wake up in the middle of the night , consumed by guilt , screaming . // Man , they even had me wondering , What if I did it ? // Well , sit back , people . The things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't even imagine . And I 'm going to share them with you . Because the story you know , or think you know-that 's not the story . Not even close . This is one story the whole world got wrong . // First , though , for those of you who do n't me , my name is Orenthal James Simpson- " O.J. " to most people . Many years ago , a lifetime ago , really , I was a pretty good football player . I set a few NCAA records , won the Heisman trophy , and was named the American Football Conference 's Most Valuable Player three times . When I retired from football , in 1978 , I went to work for NBC , as a football analyst , and in the years ahead I was inducted into both the College Football Hall of Fame and the Pro Football Hall of Fame . // I did a little acting , too , and for a number of years I was a pitchman for Hertz , the rental car people . Some of you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running late , pressed for time , leaping over fences and cars and piles of luggage to catch my flight . If you do n't see the irony in that , you will . // All of that was a long time ago , though , a lifetime ago , as I said-all of that was before the fall . And as I sit here now , trying to tell my story , I 'm having a tough time knowing where to begin . Still , I 've heard it said that all stories are basically love stories , and my story is no exception . This is a love story , too . And , like a lot of love stories , it does n't have a happy ending . // Let me take you back a few years , to the summer of 1977 . I was married then , to my first wife , Marguerite , and we were about to celebrate our tenth wedding anniversary , but it was not a good time for us . Marguerite and I had been on shaky ground for a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we reconciled for the sake of our two kids , Arnelle , then nine , and Jason , seven . A few months into it , though , while Marguerite and I were in the middle of dinner , she set down her fork and gave me a hard look . // " What ? " I asked . // " This is n't working , " she said . " And I 'm five months ' pregnant . " // I knew the marriage was n't working , but the news of the pregnancy was a real shock . // We finished dinner in silence-we were at the house on Rockingham , in Brentwood-and after dinner went to bed , still silent . I lay there in the dark , thinking about the unborn baby . I knew Marguerite would never consider an abortion , and it made for a very strange situation : The youngest Simpson would be joining a family that had already fallen apart . // In the morning , I told Marguerite that I was going to go to the mountains for a night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packed a small bag and took off . // On my way out of town , I stopped at a Beverly Hills jewelry store to pick out an anniversary present for her-we 'd been married a decade earlier , on June 24 , 1967-then paid for it and left . As I made my way down the street , heading back to my car , I ran into a guy I knew , and we went off to have breakfast at The Daisy , a couple of blocks away . We found a quiet , corner table , and our young waitress came over . She was a stunner : Blonde , slim , and bright-eyed , with a smile that could knock a man over . // " Who are you ? " I asked . // " Nicole . " // " Nicole what ? " // " Nicole Brown . " // " How come I 've never seen you before ? " // " I just started here , " she said , laughing . // She was from Dana Point , she told me , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come up for the summer to make a few bucks . // " How old are you ? " I asked . // " I just turned eighteen last month , " she said . " On May 19. " // " I 'm sorry I missed your birthday , " I said . // She smiled that bright smile again . " Me , too , " she said . // After breakfast , I made the two-hour drive to Lake Arrowhead , and I spent the night up there , thinking about my failing marriage , and trying not to think about the gorgeous young waitress who had served me breakfast . When I got back from the mountains , I went home , having resolved absolutely nothing , and a few nights later I went back to The Daisy . Nicole was there , and I took her aside . " I want you to know that I 'm married , but that my marriage is ending , " I said . " So , you know-I 'm still technically a ' married man . ' I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does I 'm just letting you know that things are going to change soon . " // " Is that the truth ? " she asked . // " It 's the truth , " I said . // Later that same night , I stopped by her apartment , on Wilshire Boulevard , and took her to a party . By the end of the evening , I was hooked . // That was in June , 1977 . For the next month , I saw her almost every single day , until it was time to leave for football . I missed her , and I spoke to her constantly . I also spoke to Marguerite , of course , to see how the kids were doing , and to make sure the pregnancy was going okay , but I was pretty confused . I had a wife back home , with a third kid on the way , and I was already falling in love with another woman . // I came home in time for the delivery of the baby , but split almost immediately after to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with back then . When football season ended , I returned to L.A. and took a room at the Westwood Marquis , and I found myself pretty much living two lives-one with Marguerite , as an estranged husband and father of three , and the other with Nicole , my new love . I spent most of my time with Nicole , of course , at the hotel or at her little apartment , and from time to time-when I was called away on business-she 'd hit the road with me. // Eventually , I met Nicole 's family-two sisters , Denise and Dominque , who were living in New York back then ; a third sister , Tanya ; and their mother , Juditha , who lived in Dana Point with her husband , Lou . I did n't meet Lou till later , but that was only because the situation never presented itself . He knew about me , of course , and I do n't think he had any objections , and if he did nobody shared them with me. // Nicole also met my kids , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was a little wary , for obvious reasons , but Nicole took to them as if they were her own . They liked her , too . Before long , the kids would n't go anywhere with me unless Nicole was part of it . // I 've got to tell you : Life was pretty good . I felt like the luckiest guy in the world . // The following year , I moved out of the Westwood Marquis and into the Hollywood Hills home of my old friend Robert Kardashian , and I asked Nicole to move in with me . I think everyone saw us as the perfect couple , including Nicole , but as the months turned into years she began to drop not-so-subtle hints about getting married . I kept trying to put her off , of course , because I 'd failed at marriage once , and because I 'd seen plenty of other couples fail , but Nicole kept pushing . This led to a number of heated arguments , and from time to time I was sure we were finished , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She believed that our relationship was special , and that we could beat the odds , and pretty soon she had me believing it , too . // In 1979 , my divorce from Marguerite became final , and Marguerite moved out of the Rockingham house . I was making arrangements to put the place on the market , but Nicole talked me out of it . " This is a beautiful place , " she said . " All it needs is a little fixing up . " // She walked me through the house , room to room , telling me what we could change , and how it would look , and it was obvious that she had an eye for that kind of thing . She ended up redesigning and redecorating the whole place , top to bottom , and it turned out so well that I encouraged her to become a licensed interior decorator . Within a year , she was working professionally . // She was happy . Sort of . The fact is , we still were n't married , and I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love her ? Did n't we have a future ? Could n't we have children now , while she was still young enough to enjoy them ? These little discussions often ended in arguments , and I absolutely dreaded them . Nicole had a real temper on her , and I 'd seen her get physical when she was angry , so sometimes I just left the house and waited for the storm to blow over . // Finally , in 1983 , we got engaged . We had a big party , and Nicole seemed very happy , but it did n't last . Within a few weeks she was pushing me to set a date for the wedding . " I 'm tired of being your girlfriend , " she kept saying . " I want to get married and have children . I 've been helping you raise your own kids all this time , and I love them , but I think it 'd be nice to have a few of our own . " // The woman had a point , but I just was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // One night in 1984 , we were in the middle of another argument , and I went outside to get away from her . There was a tether ball hanging from one of the trees , and a baseball bat lying nearby , and I picked up the bat and took a few hard swings at the ball . Nicole came out of the house and watched me for a few moments , still angry , glaring , and I crossed into the driveway , sat on the hood of her convertible Mercedes , and glared right back . I still had the bat in my hand , and I remember flipping it into the air and accidentally hitting one of the rims. // " You going to pay for that ? " she snapped . // " Yeah , " I snapped back , then took the bat and whacked the hood . " And I guess I 'll pay for that , too , since it 's my car-and since I pay for everything around here . " // She shook her head , disgusted with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into the yard and took a few more swings at the tether ball . It was crazy . It seemed all we did lately was argue . People say a lot of marriages get into trouble at the seven-year mark , and we were n't married , but we 'd been together seven years , and maybe that was the problem . // As I was trying to make sense of this , a Westec patrol car pulled up to the gate . Nicole came out of the house to meet it , and I realized it was n't there by accident . The guy got out of the patrol car and addressed us from beyond the gate . " We folks having a problem here ? " // " He just hit my car , " Nicole said . She turned to look at me , still glaring , her arms folded across her chest . // " You want to file a complaint ? " // Nicole was still staring at me , but I could see she was feeling a little foolish . // " Ma'am ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for summoning him , and he got back into his patrol car and left . Nicole looked at me again . I smiled and she smiled . A few weeks later , we set a date for the marriage . // We got married on February 2 , 1985 , right there at the Rockingham house . We had a private ceremony in the late afternoon , with close friends and family , and followed it up with a seven-course dinner for three hundred people . We had put a big tent over the tennis court , and hired a band , and people danced into the morning hours . Just before dawn , we had a second sit-down meal , kind of breakfast-themed . We did n't think there 'd be more than a hundred people left at the party , but most everyone was having such a good time that they had refused to go home . // Nicole and I went to bed long after the sun came up . We were happy . Maybe marriage is just a piece of paper , but it carries a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flew down to Manzanilla , Mexico , for our honeymoon . We stayed in a beautiful place called Las Hadas and made love three times a day . That 's why we were there , right ? To give Nicole a family of her own . // Six weeks after we got back to L.A. , Nicole found out that she was pregnant . She was so happy she was glowing-she looked lit up from inside . She read just about every book ever written on pregnancy and motherhood , then went back and reread the ones she liked , underlining the parts she found most interesting . I do n't remember her being sick once , or even feeling sick , and she was never even in a bad mood , which was kind of weird , given all the clich ? s about raging hormones and stuff . But I was n't complaining . // Throughout the entire pregnancy , the only big issue-for her , not for me-was food . She became obsessed about her weight , and when her friends were around she was very vocal about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain more than twenty-four pounds in the course of the nine months , " she 'd say , repeating it tirelessly . I guess she thought she was a big pregnancy expert or something , having read all those books , but things did n't turn out exactly as she 'd planned . She gained twice that , if not more , and pretty soon decided to stop weighing herself altogether . That was a relief , to be honest . I had no problem with the weight . My kid was in there . I thought my kid deserved a nice big home . // On October 17 , we were in the hospital for the birth of our first child , Sydney Brooke . Nicole was over the moon . She cried when we took her home , but I guess all new mothers cry . I do n't know if it 's from being happy or from being terrified , but I figure it 's probably a combination of the two . // Nicole had nothing to be afraid of , though . Right from the start , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a little too terrific . She would n't let anyone near Sydney . Not the housekeeper . Not her mother . Not even me at times . This was her baby , and her baby needed her and only her , and nothing anyone could say or do was gong to change her mind . Only Nicole knew how to feed her baby . Only Nicole could bathe her . Only Nicole knew how to swaddle that little girl and hold her just right against her shoulder . // It got to be a pain in the ass , frankly . I could n't get her to leave the house . // " Why do n't you let your mother take care of her for one night ? " I 'd say . " She 's been volunteering from the day we got back from the hospital . " // " No , " she 'd say . " Sydney needs me. " // It took months to get Nicole out of the house . We had gone from hitting all the best places in town and jetting around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part is , I kind of liked it . At first , anyway . Then I started getting antsy , and then food became an issue again . Nicole was having a tough time losing the weight she 'd gained during the pregnancy , and it was making her crazy . She would get out of the shower , look at herself in the mirror , and burst into tears . // " So do n't look in the mirror , " I 'd say . // " That 's not what I need to hear ! " she 'd holler . // " You know what ? I 'm sorry I said anything . But you 're the one that 's having a problem with your weight , not me. " // It 's funny , because suddenly I 'm remembering what Nicole 's mother told me on the very day that we first met : " Do n't let Nicole gain weight , " she said . " She 's miserable when she gains weight . " // Eventually , most of the weight came off , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survive a night or two without her , and things slowly got back to normal . No , that 's wrong-they were better than normal . Motherhood had changed Nicole in wonderful ways . She was happier than she 'd ever been , as if she 'd found her place in the world , and every day she was more in love with Sydney . I think she also loved me a little more , too . After all , we 'd created this little girl together . We were becoming a family . // On August 6 , 1988 , our son , Justin Ryan , came along . When we took him home , I looked at my little family-my second family-and I felt strangely complete . I do n't know how else to put it . All I know is that whenever I looked at them-Nicole , Sydney and Justin-I felt that I understood what life was all about . //
