<p> Parents seeking a high school with a track record of sending kids to top colleges and an environment resembling real-world diversity often end up at Lakeside . <p> The DeKalb County school 's 1,092 SAT average exceeds the national average , and a national magazine recognized the school as second in the state for the percentage of kids in Advanced Placement courses . Click on the school 's report card on the state Department of Education 's Web site and a starburst appears with the proclamation : " Bronze Award : Highest percentage of students meeting and exceeding standards . " <p> About half the school 's students are white , and a quarter are African-American . About 13 percent are Hispanic , and 9 percent are Asian  --  diversity you wo n't find in many of metro Atlanta 's other highly regarded high schools . <p> But now Lakeside has a new distinction . The school did not meet state testing goals under the federal No Child Left Behind law . And it was the diversity Lakeside touts that kept it from doing so . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students perform overall , but also the test scores of its subgroups  --  Latinos , African-Americans , English language learners , students with disabilities and those from poor families . If one group fails to meet the state standard , the whole school takes the fall . <p> That gives schools with largely homogenous student populations an advantage . For example , Southside High School in Atlanta has an SAT average of 812 , but the school met the state 's testing goals . ( Southside also got a state " gold award " for improving passing rates on state tests . ) Almost all the school 's students are African-American , and most are economically disadvantaged , so it had fewer subgroups to contend with . Southside passed . <p> Overall , Lakeside students easily met state standards . But Lakeside 's Latino students and its students deemed " economically disadvantaged " because they participate in the federal free lunch program fell short in English language arts . <p> " It 's just a fact we have to live with , " said Wayne Chelf , Lakeside 's principal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we perfect ? No . " <p> If Lakeside falls short again next year , it will get labeled " needs improvement " and have to offer students the option of transferring to another DeKalb County high school . <p> System fair or flawed ? <p> Some say the labeling of Lakeside shows that No Child Left Behind is doing exactly as intended . The law is forcing schools to teach all its students and not just ride on the success of the kids with the most advantages . <p> " To be a top-tier school , Lakeside certainly needs to serve every child , " said Pam Mason-Norsworthy , who has children at Lakeside and its feeder school , Henderson Middle , which also did n't meet the No Child Left Behind standard , known as adequate yearly progress , or AYP . <p> But Lakeside parent Larry Foster called the school 's failure to make adequate yearly progress " a bizarre development that shows just how totally inappropriate and unrealistic this rigid , nationally imposed system of evaluating school success and failure is . " <p> No Child Left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with bipartisan support . Lawmakers wanted to pressure schools into bringing test scores of poor and minority children up to the level of their affluent white peers . The law requires states to test all kids and publish passing rates within various groups as well as the schoolwide average . States gradually will raise the passing rates required to avoid the dreaded " needs improvement " label until 2015 , when all students will be required to pass . <p> Unlikely schools snared <p> More parents are learning about the law as more schools accustomed to accolades get caught in the No Child Left Behind net . <p> Centennial High in north Fulton County  --  SAT average of 1,104 and also a bronze award winner  --  did n't make adequate yearly progress this year . Economically disadvantaged students did n't do well enough in English or math . Those students make up less than 15 percent of the school 's population , but that 's enough to fill a subgroup under the state 's complex formula . And under the law , the school is only as successful as these kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ivy League . <p> Sandra Nachtmann researched Centennial High 's reputation before enrolling her daughter , who had attended a private school . Nachtmann said she was surprised the school did n't meet state standards . " That part bothers me , " she said , noting that colleges might not view her daughter 's transcript as favorably . But she is pleased with the school 's diversity . " I do feel like it represents the real world  --  being able to understand and not have such a narrow vision . " <p> Bruce Fuller , a professor of education and policy at the University of California , Berkeley , co-wrote a 2003 policy brief about what he calls the " diversity penalty . " He said it 's " sadly ironic " that metro Atlanta schools that have tried so hard to integrate and persuade middle-class families not to eschew their schools for private academies or mostly white suburban schools now face the possibility of parents moving because they see only the " needs improvement " label . <p> " No Child Left Behind inadvertently works against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law comes up for reauthorization next year , and some changes are expected in response to complaints that the law is n't fair . For example , all subgroups ' test scores could be averaged over three years , giving a more complete picture of how those students are doing , he said . <p> Some to stick it out <p> Some Lakeside parents managed to find a bright spot in their school not making adequate yearly progress . As a school that fell short , Lakeside wo n't have to accept transfer students from other failing schools . An onslaught of " AYP kids " led to crowding and chaos at some DeKalb schools last year . <p> In Gwinnett County , Norcross High  --  with an SAT average of 1,046  --  has seen its Latino population swell to 25 percent . The school , which also draws from the affluent Peachtree Corners area , is more than a quarter African-American and more than a third white , earning it a reputation for diversity and strong academics . The school offers International Baccalaureate , a program based on international standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a row , Norcross High missed under No Child Left Behind and is now deemed " needs improvement . " Latino students fell short in math and English language arts . <p> Large high schools like Norcross , which has more than 2,600 students , can offer a variety of courses . The highest-achieving kids take honors , Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate , and those who need help with English language take courses geared to language . So the kids that keep Norcross ' SAT above the national average might never sit in a classroom with the kids who ca n't pass the state tests required under No Child Left Behind . Yet the whole school wears the " needs improvement " label . <p> Lee Ann Early is n't worried about her daughter , Charlotte , a rising junior at Norcross . " Charlotte is not sitting there in class with kids who are struggling with English , " she said . " I feel bad for those kids . I hope they are getting the help they need . " <p> Donna Scullin also sees no reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if one of the county 's less diverse and higher-performing schools were an option . <p> " The world is diverse ; that is how life is now , " said Scullin , whose kids first attended Simpson Elementary . Simpson is 80 percent white , draws from the affluent neighborhoods of Peachtree Corners and has test scores that are among the highest in the state . <p> " Norcross High is giving my children a strong , well-rounded education , " Scullin said . " The bottom line for me is my children are happy ; they are excelling and doing well in school .
