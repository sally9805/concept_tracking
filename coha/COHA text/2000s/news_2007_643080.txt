<p> Many devotees of Benjamin Britten feel that his final opera , " Death in Venice , " based on the Thomas Mann novella and first presented at the Aldeburgh Festival in 1973 , is a profound , piercing and inexplicably neglected masterpiece . At the moment , though , the opera seems anything but neglected , at least in Britten 's native land . The Aldeburgh Festival , which Britten helped found , is presenting a grippingly austere production of the opera , its first staging here in nearly 30 years . The first performance , on Friday night , provided a momentous opening for this renowned festival 's 60th anniversary . <p> In London , meanwhile , the English National Opera is also presenting a production of " Death in Venice , " its first , which opened May 24 . The elaborate and brilliant staging by the director Deborah Warner offers the British tenor Ian Bostridge in the demanding lead role of Gustav von Aschenbach . I attended the performance on Thursday night . <p> John Berry , the artistic director of the English National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a coincidence . Jonathan Reekie , the chief executive of Aldeburgh , says that the matter is " more complicated . " He wanted to present " Death in Venice " at Aldeburgh for years and approached the English National Opera with the prospect of a co-production . But during the last decade that company went through tumultuous times , with administrative turnovers , deficits , labor disputes and canceled performances . So it was hard to elicit a commitment , Mr. Reekie said . The overlap may be curious , but the winners are Britten , " Death in Venice " and lucky audiences . <p> Some criticism of the opera has come from champions of Mann 's 1912 novella , which tells of an eminent German author who , suffering from a debilitating creative block , travels to Venice , where he becomes enthralled from a safe distance with Tadzio , a boy in an aristocratic Polish family on vacation . Aschenbach 's feelings turn into an obsession . Succumbing to a cholera outbreak , Aschenbach dies while sitting in a beach chair and watching his angelic Tadzio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks . <p> With a libretto by Myfanwy Piper , the opera does simplify Mann 's elaborate and philosophical story . By making dancers of Tadzio and his playmates on the beach , Britten found a stage-worthy way to depict the spell the boy casts on Aschenbach . Mann 's Tadzio , while enchantingly beautiful , is imperfect , with jagged , pale teeth and an anemic look . In Britten 's operatic telling , the music , rich with complexity , regret and ambiguity , powerfully conveys the vulnerability of the ascetic and intellectual Aschenbach as he is overcome by the vision of a beautiful boy , causing him to question every choice he has made and the worth of his art . This is something Britten understood ; though devoted to his life partner , the tenor Peter Pears , he was continually smitten with boys and young men . <p> There are ingenious strokes in this engrossing score . Though somewhat reduced , the orchestra is enriched with a battery of percussion evoking Balinese gamelan music , which Britten uses effectively to convey the Dionysian cavorting of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which depicts Aschenbach enmeshed in the intellectual world , is contrasted with hauntingly sensual diatonic sonorities to suggest idealized youth . Aschenbach sings extended passages of minimally accompanied and devastatingly poignant monologue . <p> These productions enhanced my respect for the opera 's dramatic intensity . <p> Ms. Warner 's staging uses handsome period costumes colored mostly in black , white and brown . The story opens in a graveyard and continually shifts scenes : a boat to Venice , the bank of the Lido , the canals of the city , various rooms and salons in the hotel , the beach . All are conjured here through fluid movements of curtains , walls , furniture , a steamship smokestack , dropped cloths and rope nets . The sunlight on the beach is sometimes so glaring that you almost feel the humidity . <p> Edward Gardner , a dynamic 32-year-old conductor in his first assignment as the company 's music director , delivered a nuanced and incisive performance . Besides Aschenbach , the other major role is a tour de force for a baritone , who portrays seven characters , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the hotel barber : slyly Mephistophelean figures who entice Aschenbach to follow his desires . Peter Coleman-Wright was commanding in those roles . <p> Kim Brandstrup provided sensually athletic choreography for the dancers , and Benjamin Paul Griffiths was boyish and perfect as Tadzio , sweet-faced yet slightly flirtatious as the character realizes , on some level , the allure he has for a strange man . <p> But the production is dominated by Mr. Bostridge . Although some have found him , at 42 , too young for the role , Mann 's notes suggest that he thought of the character as about 53 , and Mr. Bostridge , his back bent with perplexity , gives a courageous performance . At one point he thrashes about the stage floor in a dream scene when , tempted by Dionysus , he experiences erotic feelings for Tadzio . <p> The music suits the myriad qualities of Mr. Bostridge 's unusual voice : spectral yet warm , virile yet boyish , and , when need be , raging and intense . Mr. Bostridge 's English diction was a model of clarity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was meaningful to experience this opera in the space for which it was conceived , Snape Maltings Concert Hall . This large brick building in the neighboring town of Snape was originally a mill house for the brewing of beer . But Britten and Pears turned it into an acoustically lively and intimate 840-seat hall suitable for concerts and opera , which opened in 1967 . In the ceiling you still see the square vents through which foamy white steam was emitted during malting time . <p> But with no proscenium or backstage area to speak of , productions must be simple . This one , by the director Yoshi Oida , made simplicity a virtue . The set was just movable platforms atop a shallow pool of real water . Many images were stunning , as during the dream scene , when dancers lighted the stage with hand-held torches and surrounded the agonized Aschenbach . <p> The tenor Alan Oke gave an honorable , plaintive and volatile portrayal of Aschenbach . Peter Sidhom was arresting in the multiple baritone roles .

In another coincidence the excellent conductor was Paul Daniel , well known as the former music director of the English National Opera , a post he quit two years ago . <p> On Saturday morning I actually found myself thinking , " Well , no ' Death in Venice ' today , " and feeling a little wistful . <p> #
