Before they had ever lived in the house , somebody 's useless cow had sickened and died in the shed next door . The shaggy rope that tethered her still lay in a corner , so when Sonia figured out that her older sister , Goldie , was having to do with a boy , she got up in the night , disentangled the rope , and tied Goldie to a leg of their bed . <p> Goldie never sneaked out at night . The town was dark even during the day . Wooden sheds , shops , and houses leaned into one another , creating attenuated triangles of shadow that met and crossed and made further overlapping triangles : layers of deeper shadow . It was n't hard for Goldie to meet the boy-who was tall and chubby , with a laugh that flung droplets onto her cheeks and made her ears tingle-during what was known as day . <p> In the morning , Goldie 's leg jerked sideways when she turned to put her feet on the floor , and she laughed at her sister 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was still sleeping . The rope 's rough fibers had hurt Sonia 's fingers . When she felt Goldie 's touch on her ankle , in her sleep , her sore hand went to her mouth . Sonia , at fourteen , still sucked her thumb . <p> Goldie became pregnant . Their parents were frightened . Nothing like this had happened in either of their families before . They had n't known about the tall boy-who had gone to America . ( Everyone wanted to leave if possible . ) The parents never spoke of Goldie 's big belly , but at last Aunt Leah , the mother 's sister , came to see them . " Reuben and I have money for the ship , " she said . " Give us the baby . " Leah and Reuben had no children . Goldie screamed in childbirth and for days after , bleeding in the bed , but the baby , a girl , was taken the day of her birth . Goldie 's breasts were hot . They felt as if they were about to explode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried to Sonia at night . <p> Aunt Leah was religious . She went to the ritual bath ; when she married , she 'd cut off her hair , and now wore a dusty wig . Goldie cried , " She 'll shave my baby 's head ! " Sonia was impressed that her sister could imagine the bald baby they 'd barely seen ( whose ineffective kicks and arm-swats Sonia could n't forget ) as a grown girl with hair , getting married . Maybe in New York life would be different , Sonia told Goldie . <p> Aunt Leah , Uncle Reuben , and the baby , Rebecca ( who was theirs , they told people ) , emigrated promptly . Goldie recovered quickly from childbirth , but she looked voluptuous from then on . A man who worked on the roads married her , though Sonia disliked him . He talked loudly in the presence of their still-frightened parents , but going to America was easy for him . He could n't imagine things the rest of them feared , and did n't understand how faraway and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the horrors of the passage , the trials of Ellis Island-but he did n't believe . Goldie , who could read a little , tried to show him a map in a Schoolbook , but he tore out the page , saying , " Nothing like that . " Sonia could n't read but had some respect for print . She was shocked , but her angry brother-in-law , whose name was Aaron , was making a point : his experience-simpler than other people's-never did resemble what people who spoke in detail described , not to mention the subtleties reportedly found in books . In a moment he uncrumpled the map . " All right , we 'll go to that place , " he said , waving at half of North America . <p> They followed a cousin of his to Chicago . Goldie had mixed feelings . She would never have been permitted to tell Rebecca the truth . Aaron knew about the laughing boy and the baby , but did n't believe in them , either . In Chicago , nothing turned out as Goldie expected it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hardest was losing her daughter , but now Goldie was also separated from her parents and from Sonia , who could n't even write a letter . Goldie remembered Sonia 's shy mouth on her breasts in the middle of the night , her sister 's tongue mastering the unfamiliar technique , her teeth held back but just grazing the nipple , giving relief and a terrible pleasure . When Goldie had a baby boy , the old secret made her laugh and cry when he nursed . <p> She reared her boy , then three more , with spurts of pleasure at the time of the holidays-which she celebrated primarily with food-or when she 'd hear indirectly of her sister . Best of all for Aaron and Goldie was sex , which was excellent , but second best was going out . They went to band concerts and parades , vaudeville and the Yiddish theater , then films . They ate out before anyone they knew . Aaron made a reasonable amount of money , not working on the roads here but selling fruit off a pushcart and later in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't see her , across the street from his pushcart or outside his store , observing him with a customer . His big mouth opened wide when he spoke , and sometimes she thought she could hear his loud voice-dismissing , denying , doubting-even when she should have been out of earshot . <p> Sonia married a man who whispered respectfully to her parents . They could n't always hear him , but they liked him . She soon had a girl and a boy . When her husband , Joseph , left for America alone , he announced his plans in such hushed conferences that nobody was surprised when he did what he said he 'd do : he secured a job in New York and after two years sent money for his wife 's passage , his children 's , and his in-laws ' . His own parents were dead . But Sonia 's mother had something wrong with her eyes and was afraid she 'd be turned back at Ellis Island . Saying goodbye at the train , Sonia and her parents pretended that their only important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their grandmother wrapped them in so many shawls , wiping her eyes with the corners , that the children could scarcely move . <p> On the trip to New York , Sonia thought only of her mother and father , whom she 'd never see again . She was afraid she would n't find Goldie , and she could n't remember why she cared about Joseph , but he met her in New York and had not lost his distinctive smell or sound ; he had a quizzical way of speaking , as if he found himself a bit foolish , and in turn found that discovery amusing . The babies who were no longer babies made him shake his head in silence . When they were settled , Joseph wrote letters to Goldie for Sonia . The second summer , Goldie and Aaron and-by then-three boys came overnight on the train to visit . Sonia had had another daughter . <p> One day when Joseph was at work and Aaron was engrossed in a game of pinochle taking place in the street-not shouting , for once-the sisters and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of a trolley ride . Goldie trembled when Leah 's sturdy daughter kissed her gravely . Rebecca took little interest in the cousin from Chicago and her boys , but asked to hold Sonia 's baby . Aunt Leah was quiet , and they quickly returned on the trolley to Sonia 's house , not talking , busying themselves with the children . The next night , Aaron insisted that the women leave the children with a neighbor , and they all went to a boisterous performance at the theater . The actors ' shouts , their stylized and exaggerated gestures , seemed to calm Aaron . Otherwise he was constantly restless ; Sonia did n't know what he wanted and that made her feel like a bad hostess . She wondered what it was like to be Aaron , and got far enough to sense his relief when something was vacant , when nothing was inscribed on an object or a moment , so he did n't have to deny whatever others discerned in it . <p> Rebecca knew Sonia as a cousin , and Sonia 's children-the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clara , Sophie , Sylvia , Bobbie , Minnie ) - as slightly more distant cousins . At nine Rebecca scolded Cousin Sonia for insufficient attention to the Passover restrictions , and Sonia spoke sharply , then touched Rebecca 's arm apologetically . Rebecca began taking the trolley herself to help Sonia with the children . She took good care of them , but was too strict about keeping them clean and quiet . She had unruly curly hair and a neat little nose rather like Reuben 's , not that her father ever looked up from the Talmud to notice her . Cousin Rebecca did n't laugh , Morris and the girls complained . They sat her down and played her their favorite of a pile of records that their father had brought home one night , along with a Victrola : it was called " No News but What Killed the Dog , " and told a story Rebecca found sad , though the others shrieked with laughter . <p> Rebecca finished high school and found a job typing . It was a Jewish company , and they gave her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sonia 's children did n't see her as often once she was working , but sometimes she 'd come on Sundays . " Can I help , Cousin Sonia ? " Rebecca would say , walking into the preparation of a meal or the bathing of small children . She said it so often that " Can I help , Cousin Sonia ? " became a household joke , and the girls said it to one another whenever anybody picked up a dishrag or a paring knife . <p> Sonia had never learned to read-Sylvia tried to teach her , but Sonia 's eyes became red and watery , and the project was abandoned-but the children read Goldie 's letters out loud to her , and she dictated replies . Sonia mentioned Rebecca only occasionally in her letters , not wanting to make her children wonder or make Goldie sad . Rebecca stared when Sonia 's girls talked about Aunt Chicago , as they called Goldie : Aunt Chicago ate in restaurants , went to plays , and wrote letters containing sentences about the bedroom . <p> One day Sophie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goldie to her mother . Sonia screamed , too , before she even knew what had happened . Aaron had disappeared : one day he had taken his shoes to the shoemaker 's for new heels , and had never returned . The shoemaker said he did n't remember Goldie 's husband or his shoes , and that was that . Goldie 's oldest son had been talking about quitting school and going to work . Now he did so , and Goldie took a job in a dress factory . <p> Sonia pictured her brother-in-law , in shoes run down at the heel , walking into nothing-finding , at last , some fragment of life where for some reason nobody told him about what he could n't believe in . " It 's a disease , " she told her family . " He ca n't remember where he lives . The police will bring him home when they figure it out . " <p> Goldie wrote , " At last it 's quiet around here , but I miss you-know-what . " <p> Joseph sent Goldie money . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now he was part-owner . <p> Several years after Rebecca graduated from high school , a friend married and quit her job , a good job : selling and keeping the books in a store that sold musical instruments and sheet music . The friend told the two bosses ( who never yelled , she said ) about Rebecca , who was hired after an interview , even though they were not Jewish and she said she would n't work on Saturdays . " I understand , " said Mr. Hardy , the younger boss , nodding respectfully . <p> The store was called Stevens and Hardy . Mr. Stevens was an elderly man who could repair any musical instrument , while polite Mr. Hardy , who knew little about music , talked to customers . He was a widower in his forties , with two daughters . The third week Rebecca worked in the store , she was straightening the racks of music in the evening , after Mr. Stevens had left and they 'd closed , when she was suddenly gripped around the legs . She looked down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seized Rebecca 's skirt and was hiding her face in it . <p> " What 's wrong ? " Rebecca said . <p> " Mama died . " Mama had not just died , but that was what was wrong . The little girl , Mr. Hardy 's younger daughter , Charlotte , was playing a private game with Rebecca or her skirt . At the moment she was not grieving . Nonetheless , Rebecca bent compassionately and touched the child 's hair , figuring out who she was . <p> A tall woman appeared . " I 'm sorry , miss , " she said . " Charlotte , get up . " <p> Charlotte stayed where she was . The woman was Mr. Hardy 's sister . She and Rebecca spoke politely , and then Mr. Hardy came out and introduced them . <p> The girl still knelt at Rebecca 's feet , still with Rebecca 's hand on her hair . Facing the child 's father and aunt-two well-dressed , blond , self-confident Americans , descendants of George Washington , for all Rebecca knew-Rebecca felt for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she imagined took place at a church she passed ( all but averting her eyes ) on her way to work . <p> " Get up , Charlotte , " said Mr. Hardy . Charlotte stood at last , flushed and laughing , and Rebecca 's feeling passed . Rebecca swept the floor while Mr. Hardy replaced the trumpets and saxophones that customers had examined in the course of the day , and rechecked lists he 'd made , as he did every night-sitting in his tiny office with the door open , singing jazz melodies extremely softly and slowly . When everyone left that evening , Mr. Hardy 's sister and Charlotte went out first . Mr. Hardy held the door for Rebecca so as to lock it behind her , and he turned and looked at her in a way that seemed expectant . " Your daughter is pretty , " Rebecca said . <p> Mr. Hardy 's cheeks reddened , and then-standing in his coat , holding his hat at his side-he changed suddenly . He seemed to grow slightly shorter and wider ; his limbs seemed rounder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a human being had been replaced by a live person , inevitably less precisely assembled . Mr. Hardy was a gentile , but when he grasped the brass doorknob , Rebecca realized , it felt round and hard to him , exactly as it did to her . She suddenly pictured his arm , under his coat and shirt , full of tangled veins . " How did your wife die , Mr. Hardy ? " Rebecca said . " If it 's all right to ask . " <p> " It 's all right , " he said . " She had a ruptured appendix . " <p> " I 'm sorry . " <p> " Thank you . " <p> A few weeks later , after Rebecca had found herself having occasional strange thoughts about Mr. Hardy-not just about the veins on his arm but other parts of his body-he invited her to come for a walk . It was spring , and still light when they closed the store . They walked to a German bakery , where they drank tea and ate coffee cake . Rebecca , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object . The bakery was n't kosher , but Mr. Hardy was such a conscientious person that she knew he did n't understand , and she did n't want to make him feel bad . The walk was repeated . <p> Her parents did n't ask why Rebecca came home from work later and less hungry . Everything about the music store baffled them ; there was no point in inquiring . But Rebecca was surprised at how readily she ate at the bakery , just because poor Mr. Hardy was a widower , a man to be pitied-as if the kosher laws had an exception for tea with the grieving . She asked him questions about his daughters , about his own life . Rebecca was well-behaved , but not shy . At last , on a day when she was particularly enjoying Mr. Hardy , enjoying the look of his neck coming out of his shirt collar , she blurted out , " I 'm not supposed to eat at a place like this . " <p> " Even though it 's not pork ? " <p> " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you tell me ? " <p> " They do n't know . " <p> Timothy Hardy was not accustomed to concealing his behavior or feeling ashamed of it . He 'd assumed she understood he was courting her , and that her parents would , too . Before asking Rebecca to walk , he 'd decided he probably would marry her . He planned to give up pork and to accompany her to the Jewish church on Saturdays . He thought her parents would be doubtful at first-he was not Jewish , he had been married , he had children-but they would be reassured when they realized what an upright and serious-minded son-in-law he 'd be . <p> Rebecca had liked Timothy Hardy 's seriousness from the start . he reminded her a little of Cousin Sonia 's husband , Joseph , who 'd parcel out a small chicken with scrupulous fairness to his many children , making ironic , self-deprecating comments , sometimes inaudible except for their tone . Timothy Hardy was not ironic . Irony alarmed him because he could n't endure the risk of being misunderstood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guessed he wanted to marry her . Rebecca did n't know gentiles could marry Jews . <p> " Tell them , " Timothy Hardy now began to urge her , though he still did n't mention marriage . " Tell your mother I 've asked you to drink tea . Let me visit her . " <p> " What will you talk about ? " <p> " I 'll tell her I 'd like to take you to a concert . She 'll see that I 'm not young , but that is n't so bad . " <p> " I do n't think I can do that , " said Rebecca . She tried to imagine her mother , who was engaged these weeks in embroidering a Torah cover for the shul , putting down her work and rising to greet Timothy Hardy . It was n't just that Leah would object to him . She would be as alarmed by his interest in her daughter as if Rebecca reported that the streetcar or the lamppost on the corner wanted to visit her at home . <p> Mr. Hardy stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother , now dead , with a warmth Rebecca envied , and she knew he would n't allow himself to lead a young person into disobedience to her parents . " Whenever I went to see my mother , " Timothy had confided one afternoon , " she 'd insist she had known just when I 'd get there . At last I went to visit her at six in the morning , and she said , ' Well , Timothy , I am surprised to see you ! ' " After that story he blinked several times , smiling hard , his dimples showing and his mustache looking stretched . Rebecca understood how daring-how loving-it had been for him to go so far as to play a trick . <p> After taking some walks by herself in a different direction , Rebecca knew that she loved Timothy Hardy , and that he 'd given her up because she was too cowardly to tell her mother about him . If she was in love , she thought she ought to be brave enough to tell Leah , even though she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a walk or to a concert or anywhere . When she looked at her broad face in the mirror , with heavy curls falling over her forehead-the alert face of someone about to follow instructions carefully-she was astonished to discover that it could be the face of someone in love . She thought she 'd like to die saving the lives of Timothy Hardy 's children . <p> One evening , Leah was alone , embroidering near the window , when Rebecca came back from visiting her cousins . The day was fading , and it was time to stop and light the lamp , but Leah had kept working , making neat silvery lines and loops , soothed and enchanted by her own skill . When Rebecca came in , Leah smiled apologetically . " I should have more light , " she acknowledged . Leah 's eyesight was n't as good as it had been . <p> It was unusual for Leah to sound apologetic or tentative . She was a firm , vigorous person who followed the elaborate dictates of her religion precisely , picturing herself as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had a deeply pious father , and now she had a deeply pious husband . She was grateful to both of them , feeling obscurely that if they had n't taught her to be quite so scrupulous , something bad would have been freed in her . Her father and husband did n't seem to experience something Leah had known from childhood , a slightly exhilarating , slightly nauseating awareness that truths might also be false . Sometimes a compelling , hateful picture appeared uncontrollably in Leah 's mind : the embroidered Torah cover , for example , smeared with feces . Leah knew how to keep her head down when that happened , whisper a prayer , and keep embroidering . She 'd brought up her daughter carefully . <p> Rebecca lit the lamp . Her mother looked up and smiled , and Rebecca thought that Leah looked surprisingly young at that moment , with her double chin and the bags under her eyes momentarily in shadow . A look of query passed over Leah 's face , and it was almost as if she 'd invited her daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat , slid into a chair , rather than seating herself properly , and said , " Mama , I think I love Mr. Hardy . " <p> " I think " was a lie , Rebecca 's bow to convention , her effort to sound as she thought she should . She had always been so good that she 'd had no practice speaking of hard subjects . Everything she 'd said up to now had been something she knew her parents wanted to hear . <p> Leah looked up , so startled she thought for an instant that she must have imagined rather than heard her daughter 's words , and her hand went to her mouth . " Sha ! " she said involuntarily , though nobody could hear them . <p> " But I do . " <p> Rebecca suddenly grinned at her mother like a baby , and her wide face glowed . Leah 's hands prickled . She saw herself sitting in her chair , the Torah cover in her lap , as if she were someone else : she had a sensation of disconnection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when someone told her that her father was dead . She said , " He wo n't . . . " <p> " He did . I think he 's changed his mind , so there 's nothing to worry about , but I want to tell him I love , him , just so he 'll know . He 's a good man , Mama . Sometimes when we walk together , he says just what I 'm thinking . It 's as if he 's Jewish . " <p> " Shhh . " Leah shook her head hard . It was beyond consideration . They would have to hold a funeral . " You must stop talking like this . " It was her fault . Leah should have thought about men . She should have pointed Rebecca toward a man at shul , or spoken to a friend . In Europe it would have been simple . " Rebecca , " she said , " would you bring me a glass of water ? " <p> Rebecca hurried out , still in her coat , and brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward her mother when she was still halfway across the room . Leah started to rise and accept the glass , but its surface was slippery , or Rebecca , with new recklessness , let go too soon . The glass did not fall for a moment . Somehow it seemed to rise , and the water-Rebecca had filled it too full-rose in a circle as well , as if a heavy fish had dived , making a wave that broke over the hands and arms of Rebecca and her mother , and the Torah cover that was still in Leah 's other hand . For a moment the water resembled feeling , pure and intense . Then it was just water , and the conversation ended with mopping , broken glass , apologies , and consultations about damp embroidery . <p> Just after the front door of the store had been locked the next evening , Rebecca stood in front of Timothy Hardy 's desk as if she wanted to request permission to buy ink for the ledger . He looked at her over the rims of his glasses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " said Rebecca . " I know you do n't want to take me walking anymore , and of course we could n't . . . I told my mother- " <p> Timothy sprang up , letting his glasses fall to the desk and slide onto the floor . He seized her by the shoulders . " Marry me , " he said . " I will become a Jew . " <p> " You ca n't . " <p> " I mean I 'll convert . " <p> " I do n't think . . . " <p> " Your mother will change her mind when I convert . " <p> She shook her head tearfully . He kissed her . <p> Timothy went to a synagogue he 'd noticed on the Lower East Side . He knew enough to go on Saturday , but he could n't read the Hebrew letters saying what time the service began . He thought ten a.m. would be fine , and when he arrived he saw men coming out and going in , so he walked in behind them and sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murmuring , stopping to converse , swaying and murmuring again . Eventually the scrolls in their silk cover were brought out , and Timothy was amazed to see something lavish and colorful in this drab setting . The service went on for hours . When it was over , Timothy approached the rabbi , hat in hand . " Excuse me , " he said , " I would like to become Jewish . " He wondered if the rabbi spoke English . <p> " Put on your hat , " the rabbi said , and Timothy took that as a dismissal , apologized , and left . Maybe he could find a different synagogue . <p> Rebecca noticed that her mother looked frightened for weeks after their conversation , and she worried that she 'd damaged Leah 's health with her surprising admission . She did n't mention Mr. Hardy again . When they were alone in the store , she and Timothy planned their life . She could n't resist these conversations . She would care for his children , and they 'd have more . " Maybe you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You might not like Lucy 's taste . " Lucy was his dead wife . <p> " We 're keeping Lucy 's furniture , " said Rebecca , sounding like her mother . <p> " You are the bride . " <p> " Bride shmide . " She 'd found her true work and wanted to get busy . She 'd learn to laugh so Timothy and his daughters could laugh . Her cousins could teach her jokes . She 'd get them to explain what was so funny about that record , " No News but What Killed the Dog , " which consisted of a recital of disasters . <p> One evening Timothy told her that the rabbi who was preparing him to become Jewish , after discouraging him several times , had explained an unexpected next step . It was necessary for Timothy to be circumcised . He looked at Rebecca with love and some embarrassment , and she slowly took in what he was saying . Rebecca had allowed herself , for a few seconds at a time , alone in her bed , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as if lights had been turned on in a room that should be dark . Staring into Timothy 's face , Rebecca acquired a rapid education . Her father must have a penis , too , as well as Cousin Joseph and his son , Morris . When they were little Jewish babies , their little penises had been cut . She had been to a bris more than once . She knew all about mohels and what they did , but she had never allowed herself to think the thoughts she thought now , that baby boys grew into men , that their penises grew , too , that men who were not Jewish had different penises , that a different penis hung at this moment in Timothy 's trousers . Involuntarily she glanced down , and then she glanced down frankly . " It will hurt . " <p> " They do something ... " <p> " When are you going to do it ? " <p> " Next week . There 's a man who does it . " <p> " A mohel . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slender and very bright . " Shall I come with you ? " <p> " If you would walk to the building with me ... " <p> " And wait ? " <p> He hesitated . It was late fall , and Timothy was wearing thick trousers . He stood firmly on his two big legs , which he tended to separate a little . His tweed jacket was thick , too . It seemed to her that his clothing was fur ; he was naked in the way an animal is . Rebecca knew she wanted to do something , but at first she did n't know what . Then she pulled her broadcloth blouse free of her skirt . As she pushed it up toward her neck , she knew the gesture was clumsy , that she must look more foolish than alluring , with crushed cloth bunched under her chin . Holding the sturdy material in place , she tried to push aside her slip , which came up high on her chest , with a brassiere under it . Rebecca 's breasts were large , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hand , which trembled , and drew it under her clothes . He pushed the cloth aside , leaned over her , found and released her breast , and put his mouth on it . He seemed to be crying . " Walk there with me , but then go away , " he said . <p> " But wo n't you need someone , later ? " Her voice had a sob in it , because of the pleasure of his touch on her breast . <p> " Jews are used to trouble , " Timothy said . He was making a joke , the second of his life . <p> She loved his joke . " Are you really Jewish ? " she said . <p> He stepped back from her and held out his hands , turning them as if the answer was written on them , maybe on his palms , maybe on the backs of his hands . " Shema Yisrael ... , " he began , and though the vowels were flat , Rebecca recognized what he was saying . Her cheeks grew warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , throbbing-Timothy was enraged with himself and with all Jews . He wondered if a cruel trick had been played on him , and if years from now he might discover that circumcision was rare among Jews , and that the rabbi had put him through such an experience as punishment for desiring one of their women . First his wife had died , and now , when he had miraculously fallen in love again , this hideously ludicrous requirement had been placed upon him . A religion that required him to expose himself , that required blood and pain ... They gave him whiskey , but it just caused a headache . In bed , he tried not to think of his view of the knife , just before the job had been done , despite the mohel 's courteous effort to place his black-clothed self between Timothy and the table where it lay . Now his penis felt as large as a melon . If it were infected , he would die and be buried a Jew , to the consternation of his Protestant relatives . Timothy began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Jesus , the Jew he 'd betrayed . As the pain lessened a little , as he began to think he might want to touch his penis to someone else 's body again , he imagined the future , in which he and Rebecca would endure derision and shame . Timothy and Rebecca , the well-behaved . That was what they had in common , good behavior and the discovery that it meant nothing : it originated in no excellence , afforded no ease or safety . <p> Timothy wanted to be present when Rebecca told her parents that he had become a Jew , but she refused . Three days after his conversion , she helped her mother cook supper , though her hands shook and she dropped the potatoes . " Stir , " Leah said , and Rebecca stirred the soup and skimmed the fat . It was Shabbos . Rebecca waited until her father came into the dining room , then until her mother had spoken the blessing and lit the candles . She still could n't speak .

Rebecca said , " Mr. Hardy wants to marry me . " Her father sat back quickly ; obviously Leah had n't told him . " He has become a Jew , " Rebecca continued . Then she started to cry . " Because he loves me . He ... he went to the mohel . He was cut . " <p> Her father stared . " You did n't tell me ? " he said . " Rebecca ? " <p> It had n't occurred to her how he 'd feel . He did n't look angry , as she had expected . He pushed his chair back , looking pinched and fearful , as if he 'd been exiled . She 'd never seen her father look that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth , and now she bit it and pulled it away quickly and then put it on the table . Rebecca could see tooth marks . " Rebecca , " said Leah quietly , her voice unsteady , " I am not your mother . " <p> In a rush , Rebecca heard the mumbled story of Goldie the difficult and shameless , who she thought must somehow remind Leah of Timothy-but that was n't the point . It became clear why Papa , by now , was backing his chair toward the window . The knob at the top of the chair made a star-crack in the glass that nobody noticed until next morning , by which time Rebecca , who 'd cried all night , no longer thought of it as her window , or in any sense her responsibility . Yet she felt for the poor broken pane a nostalgia that made her weep some more . For calamity had not made Leah 's speech extravagant and hyperbolical .

Rebecca was their first cousin , and Sonia , who seemed incapable of secrecy but had known all along , was Rebecca 's aunt . After the first hard night , Rebecca had taken the trolley , Shabbos or not , to her cousins ' house . " Mama says she 's not my mama . " <p> Sonia started and sucked in her breath . " Aunt Chicago is your mama . " <p> Nobody remembered Goldie very well . " Aunt Chicago whose husband walked out .

" <p> " She was a girl . What did she know ? " <p> Rebecca got on a bus and went to Chicago , where she located her mother in a tenement that seemed from the outside much like the one where she 'd grown up , but was different inside . Rebecca had not thought to telephone Goldie ; she 'd simply taken the address from Sonia , packed a bag , had a tearful , stubborn conversation at the store with Timothy , and set forth . When Aunt Chicago-who had long gray-brown hair that she had n't yet braided that morning-opened the door in her bathrobe , a dog pressed past her , wagging her tail and barking . Goldie and Rebecca looked at each other , listening to the dog . Finally Goldie said , " Who ? " <p> " Rebecca . " <p> " From Aunt Leah ?

Suddenly Rebecca belonged to twenty people and a dog she had never known about : half-brothers , friends . The rejoicing involved food , dancing , drink , talk , shouts . Goldie said , " I lost that worthless Aaron , but I got my baby back . " When Rebecca told her about Timothy , Goldie asked , " What if he ca n't still do it , from the cutting ?

Timothy was the oldest , but he outlived them all , weeping and praying in a Florida synagogue in his old age , when he looked more Jewish . People asked him what his name was changed from . He thanked God for the happiness he 'd had in his life . He and Rebecca , Goldie and her second husband , would all go dancing at a big hotel in Miami Beach . Rebecca always looked like a demure young girl , even as she grew gray , but she learned lightheartedness . At the wedding of one of Goldie 's sons , she walked to the microphone in a slinky green satin dress and wished her half-brother " every kind of happiness , including with no clothes on . " It was Rebecca 's closest approximation to a dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Timothy thought , remembering-as he drove a big white convertible to the synagogue in the Florida sun-the way she had offered him her breast that first time , drawing his hand under her clothes .
