Chapter One : Now You have to watch what you say here because everything you say means something and somebody 's always telling you what you mean . " Step off , " I tell this nurse when she tries to get me to eat . " You mean , thank you for caring , " she says . " You 're welcome . " " I need a lighter , " I tell her , and she goes , " You mean you want a lighter . Dream on , sweetheart . " So I take their medicine and walk around in socks the way they make you , and stay real quiet . " Hello , America , " he goes . " I 'm Dr. B. " He holds out his hand , but I play like I do n't even see it . " I 'll be your therapist while you 're here at Ridgeway . " He drops his arm like it 's no big thing and dumps his skinny butt in a chair behind his desk . " You can sit anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messed-up eyeglasses or an attitude like those other ones back at Applegate . He 's just regular . I stay standing . " We 'll meet at this time for forty-five minutes every Tuesday and Thursday . " I keep my back right up on the door . He 's all calm , like it 's cool with him . " Our sessions will be confidential . Are you familiar with the rules of confidentiality ? " I do n't bother answering . " Confidentiality means what 's said in this room stays in this room . " He stops a second , looking at me , close . " Except for three things . " Looking at me straight up . " If you tell me that someone is harming you , if you express the intent to harm yourself , or do so , or if you express the intent to harm anyone else , or do so . Those three things do n't stay private between us . " " That 's it ? " I go . " ' That 's it , ' what ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That 's all you 've got , if I say I 'm going to off myself ? " " Is that what you 're planning ? " " Huh ? " " Are you planning to kill yourself ? " " That 's not what I asked . " " I know that 's not what you asked . " He 's leaning forward on his elbows , like he 's interested , like he for real even cares . " It 's no big secret , doc , " I go . " How the hell do you think I got here ? " They try to make me do group . " Who wants to share with America what the purpose of this group is ? " the lady goes . Nobody bothers , so she picks on some kid all bent over with his arms crossed looking like he 's got nails twisting up his stomach . " Don ? " the lady goes , and he squeaks his chair and crosses his arms the other way . " Supposed to talk or something , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Please sit down , America , " the lady tells me . I head for the door . " America , you are required to participate in group , " the lady goes . I keep walking . " Privileges , " I hear her yelling . Points , tickets , privileges . You do this , they give you that many . You get that many , they let you out . Let you out where ? Some other sorry-ass place . I do n't need this . I 'm not stupid . I know it 's going to get real tiring standing by his door for near to an hour . So I sit this time . " I guess you 're not in the mood to talk , " Dr. B. goes , after a lot of minutes . I lean my head over the back of the chair and stare up at the ceiling . " I guess you 're not much in the mood to be here , either , " Dr. B. says , all calm . " You 're some genius , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know , and I do n't care . I 'm just slamming my pillow on the floor every night . Sleeping on my back , flat out , with my arms straight down my sides . Like I 'm in a coffin . " It 's hard to know how to begin . " " What 's that supposed to mean ? " His ceiling is white stripes and a round light in the middle . " Just what it says , " he goes . " Sometimes , it 's hard for people to begin their sessions . " " Ah , man . " My neck aches , bad , but I keep my head hanging over the back of my chair anyway . " You seem annoyed . " " Yeah , I 'm annoyed . Who would n't be ? " " Maybe that 's part of why it 's hard to start each session . " " Maybe you 're repeating yourself . " " Maybe you 're so annoyed to start with , it makes you not want to talk . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did talk ? " " I talk , man . " " Not so much . " " So ? " " I 'm curious about what keeps you from talking . " " Well , you 're going to have to live with curious a long time , doc . " You get in line , and you slide your tray , and they hand over your baby carrots and your chicken and your roll , and you sit at some table with a million other dudes , and you eat , and it tastes like your own tongue , and you wish you could just choke to death once and forever right here , right in the middle of nothing . " Some people believe that depression is anger turned toward the self , " Dr. B. says . He might not have attitude like those other ones back at Applegate , but he 's got the same old pile of stupid games . Connect Four and checkers . Chess and Monopoly and all that . I grab his Uno cards and knuckle-shuffle them . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Because usually people who try to kill themselves are depressed , and often they 're depressed because they 're angry . " I shuffle again and then slap the stack down on his desk . " People who are able to somehow acknowledge their anger often become less depressed . " " Cut the deck , " I go , because he 's giving me a headache with all that . I try not to think about it in the rec room . I watch those guys play Ping-Pong , and I try not to think . About that anger mess . About depressed . Only every time I remember that cement rectangle with a footprint in one corner , I watch Mrs. Harper sending me away , and whenever I see Clark Poign-ant , it 's when he 's got tubes running all into the backs of his hands , and if I try to picture Liza , I just hear how she said she 'd hate me if I ever killed myself , and anytime Brooklyn 's face pops up in my head , I see him stealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about hide-and-seek , I see Browning . I watch that ball popping back and forth , and I try not to think . " What would it be like ? " Dr. B. goes . " Huh ? " " Being dead . " " Huh ? " " You 're interested in being dead . I 'm interested in what you think being dead would be like . " " You 're the doctor , man . You tell me . " " I do n't know . Different people imagine different things . I 'm wondering what you imagine . " Empty . Quiet . Nobody 's good . Nobody 's bad . Nobody 's nobody . You do n't think . You do n't remember . You do n't be . Nothing hurts . " Step off , " I tell him . " Hmm , " he goes . CONTRACT FOR SAFETY I , America , agree that if I feel I might harm myself , I will immediately follow the plan below : 1 ) Notify on-duty nurse of my feelings . 2 ) Write down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of each feeling I 'm experiencing , followed by the thoughts and/or events which preceded it . 4 ) Notify and discuss all of the above with Dr. B. immediately upon our next scheduled session . In addition , I give my promise that I will not try to harm or kill myself , should I experience the wish to do so . It 's one of the most messed-up things I ever heard in my whole stupid life . If you feel so bad you want to die , why would you even care what kind of lame-ass promises you make ? I 'm not signing shit . " Some kids do n't want to feel better , " Dr. B. says . So what . " Because it 's too frightening , " he goes , and then he stops . I 'm resting my head over the back of this chair and staring up at his ceiling . " Think about it a second . " " I do n't like to think . " I hang my head way far back and see his bookshelves upside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got some kind of little statues lined up . Dollhouse people , or something . We 're quiet for a real long time , but then he goes , " I 'm guessing you 're used to feeling mad and bad . " " So ? " I go . " Feeling better would be something you do n't know . " " You got that right , " I tell him . " A lot of people are scared of what they do n't know . So they hold on to mad and bad . " I 'm not even going to play like I know what all he 's saying . So I stay quiet . My pills used to be green . Wheatgrass , Mrs. Harper would say . Then blue . Now yellow . They 're all the same shape . Stretched-out ovals . The nurse brings me one every morning and watches me swallow it . I do n't care . Some people take all different ones . A mess of colors , and all these shapes . They try to hold their pill under their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's likely a million pills these nurses have to keep all stocked up here . Somebody 's making a straight-up fortune . " How many weeks have I been here ? " I go to the group lady . " Excuse me ? " " I did n't know that kid could talk , " some scrub goes . " How long have I been here ? " " About three weeks , " the group lady says . " Is that something you 'd like to speak about ? " I shrug and stare at this crack on the wall , this crack that does the shape of a big-ass crumpled square . It looks like a TV after someone smashed up all the corners . I watch it for the whole rest of the time , so I do n't know how I get to noticing it , but all of them that used to be in this group are gone except me . It 's new guys now , and I 'm the only old one . " All right , " Dr. B. goes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't play anything else , and I still wo n't talk , either . " Where would you like to be five years from now ? " " Nowhere , " I tell him . The thing is , Mrs. Harper might be alive . She might be in some bed somewhere , in some nursing home , just hoping for someone to come see her . Or she could be hanging out with Clark Poignant up there in Heaven . Dead . This one kid screams at night . If Liza or Brooklyn were here , either one , they 'd find out quick right where he 's at and tell him to shut the hell up . This kid 's in some other hall or wing or someplace . The screaming 's not real loud , because must be he 's far away , but it 's bad . It 's the kind that makes you picture a movie scene with some crazy-looking dude , wrapped in sheets , all sweaty and bug-eyed . Like something real , real deep went down with him he 's likely never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betting he 's real pissed they 're keeping him alive . I could ask , but I 'm too tired . So I listen instead . I listen to the nurses chitchatting , and I listen to the other guys telling all their private business and everybody else 's , and I listen to Dr. B. even when he thinks I 'm not . You figure out a real lot when you 're just quiet and you listen . Here 's what I figure out . This place , Ridgeway , has just about everything . It 's got buildings for girls and buildings for boys and buildings for both . It 's got buildings for real serious , like me , where you live , and for people who sleep somewhere else but come in here for the day . It 's got a building for if you 're here because a judge made you , and it 's got a building for if you 're all used up from drugs . The street kind , not their kind . Me . I was in emergency first , right after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugged me up intense for a while , and then they did n't drug me up as much , and then emergency kicked my butt out and put me here . Most people stay about a month , maybe two , and then go somewhere else . They go home for good , or else to sleep at night and then back to Ridgeway or some other place for day treatment . Or they skip home and land right in long-term residential . That 's what Applegate was , long-term residential treatment . I was n't supposed to get sent there in the first place . I should have gone to some group home . Some foster care group home , only the system screwed up . Stupid thing is , right now I would go back to Applegate , only they just got this new rule of not letting kids in older than thirteen , and the other long-term residential eighteen miles away is full , and the rest are out of my district , so I 'm not allowed in , and there 's no beds left in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is jail , which is where I know I ought to be . Or else a state hospital , but you only get sent to a state hospital if you 're so far gone , you 're pulling out your eyeballs thinking they 're grapes , or some damn thing . So I 'm here . " You only let people out after they spill their guts , right ? " " What do you mean ? " " I 'm saying , you only let people leave this place if they 're all talking every minute in their sessions , right ? " " Something 's given you that idea ? " " Hell yeah , man . I see how it is . It 's those guys who talk that get to leave . Like that Don guy from group . He used to never say boo , then all of a sudden you ca n't shut him up . He 's talking every second , and bang . He 's out of here . " " I see . " " Well , I 'm not telling you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your thoughts and feelings with me , you 'll leave here more quickly ? " " I do n't think . I know . " " So you 've decided not to talk . " " Yup . " " So you do n't want to leave here . " " I did n't say that . " " So you do want to leave here , " he goes . " So , nothing , man . " " Maybe you have mixed feelings about it . Maybe sometimes you want to be here and other times you do n't . " " Can you just be quiet a second ? " " Or , maybe , sometimes right at the same time you want to be here and also you do n't . " " I asked you to shut up . You 're making me dizzy . " We play checkers . You do n't have to think . You do n't have to talk . Say things that might make you remember , might make them send you away when you 've got no place to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ground , no shopping mall to hide out in , or bushes in a park . No couch up for grabs in some dude 's crib . No nothing . I 'm listening to that kid screaming from which-ever wing they 've got him in , and I wish I had my shoelaces . You can see good enough in the middle of the night here because they keep the hall lights on , and I could hypnotize my sorry self the way they do in those cartoons where some hanging watch going back and forth makes a dude black out even though the guy 's awake and all . I could tie something heavy to the end of a shoelace and swing it back and forth in front of my face and stare and stare , keeping my head real still , and letting my eyes go all side to side , and make myself get all spaced out . Only problem is these Ridgeway nurses , man . They took my shoe-laces , and damn if I can find anything else to use . " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you just read my file ? " " Your file . " " I know you 've got a file on me , doc . Do n't even try to play like you do n't . " " I 'm not trying anything , " he goes . " So what are you bothering me for ? " I go . " You lazy or something ? Just read the file . " " Actually , I 've read it . " " Then why do you need to talk to me ? " " Why do you think I might need to talk to you ? " " I do n't know , man . " " I 'm aware that you do n't know . I 'm just wondering what you think . " " I do n't like to think . " " Yes . You 've said that before . " " Okay . What do I think ? I think it 's your job . " " What does that mean ? " " What do you mean , ' What does that mean ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Hmm . " Sometimes , he 's just stupid . " So what 's in my file , anyway ? " " What do you imagine is in the file ? " " Are you for real ? " " Yes . What do you imagine ? " " I do n't go around imagining . " That file probably says how I was in special ed . How I cursed at teachers and stole lighters and made Mrs. Harper sick . It probably says something like , America is a boy who is a lot of trouble . America is a boy who is crazy . America might be a murderer . Be real careful of America . That 's probably what it says . That 's how those files go . I must be walking my ass from the bed to the cafeteria to the rec room to his office , but I do n't know . I just end up wherever I am . I ca n't hardly remember how I even got here . " How 's it laid out ? " I go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. B. Am I going to have to explain every last little thing ? " " Maybe , " he goes . " How 's the order of it ? Is it all one paper , like somebody telling some story about me , or is it all blanks and squares and like that ? " " You 're asking me how your file is organized ? " " That 's what I 'm asking . " " Well , how are you picturing it ? " " Would you stop with that , man ? I swear to God . " " Stop with what ? " " With that picturing shit . I 'm not stupid . I know picturing 's the same as imagining . " " Hmm . " " So just answer my question . " " All right , " he goes . " Your file has a sort of story about you as well as blanks and squares . " " How 's the story set up ? " " There 's a section about your medical history . Another section about your school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing-up history . And other sections . " " How are you supposed to know if they got all those sections right about me , if I do n't even get to check it out my own self ? " " You want to be sure what I read about you is accurate . " " That 's what I 'm saying . " " One way I could know that is to have you tell me about your own self , your own self . " " Nice try , doc . " " I 'm not trying anything , America . " I 'm flat straight without any pillow on my coffin bed . Here 's what I imagine . The growing-up section starts with me getting born . It goes like this : America got born to a crack addict who did n't want him . Two days after that , America got with a rich white family , only they did n't want him after he started turning his color . So in a couple of months quick , America got taken by the rich white family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my coffin bed and I decide imagining is right up there with thinking . Do n't like either one . " You 're going to blackmail me , right ? " " What do you mean ? " " You 're going to make me tell you all my private business before you let me see the file . " " Really . " " What else ? You 're doing your job the way they tell you . Trying real hard to get me to give it up . So now you 're all , ' America , you tell me your business , and I 'll show you the file . ' " " Hmm . " " I 'm not telling you shit . " " You dropped your pillow . " I did n't used to see these other beds right next to mine . " Hey , " this new kid 's going . " I think you dropped your pillow . " Must have been weeks before I even got to noticing this room , much less any of these other guys in here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many times , I never know who all is going to be in the next bed . " Here , " this new dude goes . He picks up my stupid pillow and drops it on my legs . America is a boy who 's been a lot of places . I bet that 's what that file says somewhere . America is a boy who gets lost easy and is not worth the trouble of finding . He 's all leaning forward on his elbows . " There 's an opening at a group home . " That 's how it works . You stay awhile one place , and then you go . " Medicaid 's been clear with us that stays on this unit are to be short-term only . You 've been here over six weeks . A time frame Medicaid does not consider to be short-term . " " Medicaid 's same as the state , right ? " " I 'm not sure what you mean . " " You know exactly what I mean . It 's all the same . Medicaid . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " America , if you 're still unable to sign the safety contract . I 'm not sure the group home will take you , regardless of Medicaid 's requirements . " " I guess you and Medicaid have a problem , then , doc . " " So you 're still thinking of killing yourself ? " " I do n't think , man . I keep telling you . " America 's nanny 's name was Mrs. Harper . Mrs. Harper was real good to America . Also Mrs. Harper 's half-brother , whose name was Browning , was real good to America . Also , Mrs. Harper 's man friend , Clark Poign-ant , was real real good to America . But then , America turned out to be bad and made people sick , so Mrs. Harper and the state sent America back to his mother . But then America 's mother had better things to do and left America with his two older brothers . Lyle was the oldest one , but Brooklyn was the baddest , so Brooklyn was in charge . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch those guys play Ping-Pong , and I try not to think . Trouble is , the more you try not to think , the more you end up thinking . This is what I think . You can know who you 're mad at but still know you 're bad and ought to be dead . Partly because just knowing who you 're mad at does n't make you any less bad and partly because if you do get better the way they want , then the feelings are going to come crashing down on you like some kind of goddamn avalanche . " If you let me read my file , I 'll sign your stupid safety contract , and you can get rid of me to that group home , " I go . " First of all , the safety contract does n't work that way . " " What way ? " " The safety contract is not some sort of trading tool . It stands on its own . And second , what makes you believe I 'm trying to get rid of you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . " I sleep in that room with all the dudes who show up and leave again . Some kid with an earring who used to be in cottage two back at Applegate shows up four beds over for a week and then disappears . I do n't care . I stand in that cafeteria line and eat their nastiness . I sit in group and do n't listen and watch Ping-Pong in the rec room . That 's all I do , besides try not to think . He wo n't show me the file , and I wo n't sign the contract , and he wo n't sign for me to leave , and some other kid gets my spot in the group home . " Looks like we 're stuck with each other , doc , " I go . " Stuck , " he goes . " S-T-U-C-K . Stuck , " I go . " Rhymes with fuck . " " Hmm . " " Should have let me read the file , man . " " What is it about the file that feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with your stupid questions ? Just bring it out , already . " " I 'm sorry , but I ca n't do that right now . " " Why not ? " " Partly because I 'm not comfortable showing it until we 've talked further about what reading it might be like for you . " " Huh ? " " Reading your file could bring up feelings , America . It 's a complicated thing to read what other people write about you . I think it might feel too complicated for you to handle right now . " Those files probably only have the bad . America is a thief and a wrecker of property . America did not learn to read right until he was almost ten years old . America is a runaway . They only have all the messed-up stuff . They do n't have the smaller things . The parts that matter . " What is it about the file that feels so important to you , America ? " A red ball lollipop . The UPS man who delivers the angels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I get to the fizz in the middle , Mrs. Harper smiles at my face and touches my chin and says , " Real meaning is in the smaller things . " " It 's mine , man . " That smell of mint leaves on Mrs. Harper 's hands , same as the Chap Stick she makes me smear on in the winter . A rusty streak in Clark Poignant 's silver hair . The way he always brings Mrs. Harper white tulips cut straight from his garden and teaches me to shake hands , real firm and solid . The sweet smell of Browning 's brown cigarettes . " It 's yours ? " Dr. B. goes . " That 's right , man . My business is mine . I own that shit . " I hide under the paint table , and Mrs. Harper goes , " Where is America ? " And I pop up , and she goes , " There he is ! " And I scream because it 's real good to get found . And she stands up from her stool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes , " I see you , Mister . I see you over there . " And I scream because it 's real good to be seen . And she pulls off her smock and goes , " I 'm going to get you , America ! I 'm going to get you ! " And I 'm banging out the screen door running real hard and laughing real hard , and she 's running right after me and laughing , too , and she 's going to snatch me up any minute and hold me real close and tickle , and I run harder , and then she catches me , and she 's going , " I got you ! I got you ! " and she 's got me right down between her warm self and the scratchy grass , and she 's wiggling her fingers up under my arms , and we 're laughing like crazy , and I 'm screaming my head off . " My not letting you read your business makes you feel I 'm taking away something that 's yours , " Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harper screw the paint caps on and soak the brushes , and those angels stand and fly and kneel and sit on our built-in bookshelves waiting to dry off , get repacked , and sent back to the people who pay us for them . They cover every wall of Mrs. Harper 's workroom , the great big mess of them protecting the whole house , like a real pretty army . " Maybe you could just tell me more about your business being yours , " Dr. B. says . " I told you , doc . I 'm not telling you anything . " I lie flat out straight in my coffin bed , and it 's getting on my nerves . How Dr. B. gets things going in my head , making me see things I do n't hardly care to see . That 's the problem with talking to people . All that talking makes you get cracks in your brain , and then all these flashes start leaking right on through . " You seem extra quiet today . " I 've got my neck fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open on that round light . " I 'm always quiet . Nothing extra about it . " I lean my head back more and check out those sand people on that bookshelf behind me , all upside down . They 're gray and little , the size of my fingers . " Maybe what I mean is that I 'm noticing you 're not interested in playing any games today and you have n't looked at me at all . " " Whatever . " They 've got guns and drums and all that . Soldiers . A bunch of soldiers . " Maybe something 's happened that 's brought up some feelings . " " Nothing 's happened , man . I eat . I sleep . I piss . I go to group . I come here . Time up yet ? " " Almost . Those are things that happen for you on the outside . Maybe something else has happened with you on the inside that 's brought up some feelings . " I 'm sitting in a booster seat in the middle of Clark Poignant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm . I 'm filling in the coloring book page with crayons the waitress gave me . " Look , " Mrs. Harper goes . " It 's America . " She points her finger with the round , black ring to my page . Clark Poignant says , " That 's a map of where we live . " " That 's New York , " Mrs. Harper says . " That 's in America . We live in New York in America . " " I 'm America , " I tell them . " Yup , " Browning goes , hanging his arm over my shoulder . " You 're America . " " America is the place where we live , and it 's also your name , " Mrs. Harper says . " I 'm in America , " I say . " And America is me . " I like saying that . I like the sound of it and the beat of it and the way it makes Mrs. Harper and Clark Poignant and Browning smile . So I say it again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " We 're done now , if you want to leave . " I sit up . " Huh ? " " I said , " Dr. B. goes , " we 're done for today . " You try not to think . You try not to imagine , but then those cracks pop up , and these flashes squeeze right through . At first , some of it 's not too bad , and you get stupid , maybe even wanting a little more , but then you pull yourself together , knowing what all is likely going to ooze out if you 're not careful . So you try to patch up this one crack real quick , but then some other one pops up faster than you can spit , and then you 've got to rush your ass around trying to keep things shut tight . That 's the problem with being in one place too long . You 're at somewhere too long , and your brain gets weak . It 's enough to drive a person straight out of his own mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , doc ? " I go . " How long do you want to stay here ? " " Who says I want to stay here ? " " I 'm just remembering that time you mentioned that you were n't planning to talk much because you believed that meant you would leave soon . " " So ? " " So I took that to mean that a part of you would like to stay here . " " Well , I do n't know what all you 're talking about now , man . " " Hmm . " " Anyway , I do n't stay places long . " " What 's long ? " " What do you mean , ' What 's long ? ' " " I mean , how long is long . A week ? A year ? " Clark Poignant 's in his bed , even though it 's light outside , and he has his own nurse , even though his house is n't a hospital . " Saturday will go by quicker than you think , " he tells me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . And then Monday you 'll start kindergarten . " He raises his arm to touch my shoulder , the way he always does , and I 'm scared the tube in the back of his hand will slide out , making him bleed . " He 's just confused , " Mrs. Harper says when I hide behind her . A little rip in her voice makes me look up at her face and then grab her finger with the black , round ring on it . I rub the top of the ring , and she lets me , and it 's smooth and feels good . " Kindergarten , " Clark Poignant says . " Can you believe it ? " " An unsupervised visit , " Mrs. Harper says back , with that rip again . " That 's what I ca n't believe . " " Does he know how to call us ? " Clark Poignant asks Mrs. Harper , and she says , " He 's got everybody 's number memorized , " and then I make them smile by saying all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Harper said a boy my age could do it , and I did . " Tell Clark about collect , " Mrs. Harper says , so I do , and he says when I get home to call him collect for practice . Back at Mrs. Harper 's , on the upstairs phone , I push zero , just like she showed me , and I give out Clark Poignant 's number , and the operator goes , " Who can I say is calling ? " " America , " I say , and Mrs. Harper smiles at me from her rocking chair . I hold the phone out to her for a second , but Mrs. Harper waves it back at me , and then Clark Poignant 's voice is on the line , and he 's saying , " Good job . Good job . " I like the way his voice is real still and buzzes fast , like the way a bee 's body is real still and buzzes fast around a flower , both at the same time . " Long is long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I go . " Who 's ' they , ' America ? " " The state , " I tell Dr. B. " Medicaid . " " The state and Medicaid ? " Dr. B. goes . " Now you 're getting on my nerves , man . " Before my visit to my mother , Mrs. Harper 's going to paint something special with all her angels . " Can you sit still for half a second ? " she goes . I do n't figure I can , but if I say no , she 'll think I 'm being mouthy . " Do I have to go ? " I say to Mrs. Harper . " You do , " she says . " But it 's only for Saturday , America . And then you 'll come right home , and Monday after that , you 'll start your kindergarten . " " If I act extra good , do I have to go ? " I ask her . " Has nothing to do with how you act , " she says . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to abduct me ? " I say . " Adopt you . Not abduct you , " Mrs. Harper says . " She does n't have to adopt you . You 're already hers . She 's your mother . I 'm the one trying to adopt you . " " What about the papers ? " I ask her . " What do you know about papers ? " Mrs. Harper says , and I 'm scared she 's going to look at me hard and turn her back , the way she does when I 've made her mad , but she just pats her paintbrush over angel wings . " Browning said she could write her name on a paper and then the state would let her keep the paper and let you keep me and I would n't have to visit her . " " She does n't want to write her name , " Mrs. Harper says . " How come ? " I ask . Mrs. Harper looks real hard at her wet wings and then throws the angel down . It breaks into pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially not on purpose . " I do n't know , " she tells me . " I really do n't know . " " I 'm getting on your nerves , " Dr. B. goes . " Can you stop repeating every other thing I say ? " I go . " Damn . " " Unfortunately it 's a bad habit of mine , but I 'll try to stop . " " Why do n't you just try to be quiet ? " " You 're pretty aggravated right now . " " I 'm not aggravated . I 'm pissed . " Browning 's gin root beer smells nasty . His bag of Tootsie Rolls is stuffed in my back pocket . It 's heavy , like it might just take my pants right down . " Do n't you have yourself together yet ? " Mrs. Harper goes after dinner , and I wonder which part of him fell off : his head , or his arms , or his legs . Then I wonder if he has wings , so I go to check , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside . " If I 've told you once , I 've told you a million times , " she goes to Browning . " I 'm not having liquor in this house . " So now Browning holds his gin root beer in one hand and throws me the Wiffle ball with the other . " Now listen , " Browning says , tossing me an easy one . " We 're buddies , right ? " " Yeah , " I say , hitting it straight to his chest . He drops his root-beer can and claps both hands around the ball quick , the way I catch fireflies . " So listen to me careful , " Browning says . " More careful than you ever listened before . Okay ? " " Yeah , " I say , waiting for the next pitch . " Because what I 'm about to say is real different from what Mrs. Harper and Clark have been telling you . Okay ? " " Okay , " I say . " Pitch it . " He pitches it . I hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he sits on his butt in the grass and waves his hand at me to come get next to him . I do , and our faces are real close . His breath smells . He talks real low . " What you have to do is , when you get to your mother 's tomorrow , as soon as you get there , as much as you can , you be bad . " " Be bad ? " I back up from his breath . " That 's what I 'm trying to say . " He pulls a brown cigarette from behind his ear and sets it between his lips without lighting it . " Do n't listen to anything your mother tells you . Do as many bad things as you know how . Act like a real bad kid . Okay ? " His cigarette moves up and down in time with what he 's saying . " I do n't want to . " " If you act bad , " he says , " that mother of yours will make sure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your day is even up , and she wo n't ever want you to visit again , much less want to keep you . " " But Mrs. Harper will be mad . " If I do it like he says , she 'll end up looking at me hard and turning her back . " Mrs. Harper will get extra mad . " " Nope , " he tells me . " She wo n't be mad as long as she gets you home for good . " " But  --  " " I 've told you what to do , " Browning says , messing with a dandelion . He knows how to tie a knot in it and then snap the stem so the flower part flies off . " If you want your mother to leave us all be . " He shrugs at me and flicks the dandelion top . The flower hits my eye . " It 's up to you . " " What 's pissed you off ? " Dr. B. goes . " You . " " What is it that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please sit down , America . " " I 'm out of here . " " We have five minutes left , America . " " Fuck your five minutes . " " I 'll see you Thursday then . " " Oh , yeah ? Fuck Thursday . " I fuck Thursday . I keep my ass in the rec room watching Ping-Pong . I watch that ball popping all back and forth . I watch it careful , concentrating real hard , and doing that shit helps keep those cracks in my brain sealed up tight . It works so good , I almost do n't even notice Dr. B. hanging out in the doorway awhile , looking at me . " Something kept you from coming to our session Thursday . " " Whatever . " " I looked for you . " America gets lost easy . " I found you in the rec room . " And is not worth the trouble of finding . " I was interested in what it was that took you to the rec room instead of to our session . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his stupid pile of games . " War , " I go . " Something happened that kept you from our session , America . " " You know the rules ? " I 'm knuckle-shuffling . " You do n't want to discuss what happened . " " I asked if you know the rules , man . " " I 'm not sure if I know your rules . " I slap down the deck . He cuts it . " Two of spades beats everything , including aces . Aces beat everything but the two of spades . Count your cards . " " Twenty-five , " Dr. B. goes . " Twenty-seven , " I go . " Here . Pick one . " He picks . " Now we 're even . " " All right . " " So throw down , man . " We throw down . " See that ? " I say . " We got war already . " " War . " " Well , let 's go then , doc , " I say . " I De @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
