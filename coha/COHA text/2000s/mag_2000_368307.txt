Not since the Gulf War has America seen oil prices of $35 dollars a barrel , last week 's high . And the prospect of stiff prices for heating oil this winter is already giving us a chill . Not surprisingly , share prices for the big three oil companies , ExxonMobil , BP Amoco , and Royal Dutch , have risen accordingly . If you missed Big Oil 's runup , consider Not So Big Oil : companies such as Conoco and USX Marathon have been relatively ignored by investors , but they 're turning analysts ' heads . " These are companies whose profits have exploded while their share prices remain dormant , " says Ed Maran of A.G. Edwards . While a company like ExxonMobil may be stronger in terms of distribution and product diversification , " a barrel of oil is a barrel of oil  --  no matter who owns it , " says Paul Cheng of Lehman Brothers .

" For example , based on Lehman 's earnings estimates for 2001 , Marathon 's price-to-earnings ratio is less than half that of ExxonMobil .
