The Amazing Goulart denies having been an influence on either of the main characters in Alan Arkin 's story ( elsewhere in this issue ) . He does , however , own up to being the author of four mystery novels featuring Groucho Marx as a gumshoe , the most recent of which is Groucho Marx and the Broadway Murders . Due out shortly is a collection of some of his mystery stories with the wonderful title Adam and Eve on a Raft . We F &SF; readers first encountered Heather Moon in the June 1997 issue and she showed her magical presence again in our Fiftieth Anniversary issue nearly two years ago . Is the third time a charm ? <p> IT STARTED WITH THE goblins . Just about every evening at sundown back then I was in the habit of taking a walk along the beach . The cottage I was renting in the town of Santa Rita Beach sat on a low bluff overlooking the Pacific . You went down some quirking redwood stairs and there was the seashore . After I 'd hiked less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that particular evening , the weather abruptly changed . The twilight sky turned a thick , leaden gray ; a chill wind came rushing in across the darkening sea . Not typical early evening weather for Southern California in October . Then came fog , thick cold stuff that smelled strongly of damp , freshturned earth . Up ahead on my left , where nothing had been the night before , sat a fruit juice stand . It was one of those old-fashioned kind , made of galvanized metal and shaped like an orange , that you still sometimes saw at the side of roads leading to out-of-the-way towns . As I slowed , eyeing the dented orange sphere , a panel creaked and rasped open to reveal a slightly lopsided counter and a thin yellowish light within . All at once a large neon sign blossomed to life above the metal orange . GOBLIN FRUIT STAND . OPEN ALL HOURS ! Inside the sphere someone spoke in a deep , growly voice . I could n't make out any of the words , although I thought I caught my name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few previous experiences with supernatural manifestations . So I was n't exactly horrified that a batch of goblins had set up shop on the stretch of beach near my cottage and was now apparently trying to solicit my business . Squaring my shoulders once , I walked across the gritty sand to the juice stand . " I did n't quite catch what you said , " I called in the direction of the opening in the orange . " Give me a boost up , asshole , else I sha n't reach the flapping counter : " " Here now , what did I tell you about calling me insulting names ? " inquired a falsetto voice . " Stand on the blinking stool , why do n't you ? " I noticed two paws gripping the edge of the counter . They were furry and catlike paws , yet somewhat too large to belong to a cat . The fellow who looked out at me had a sort of catlike face , too . A surly gray cat about the size of a three-year-old child . He was dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monk 's robe and cowl . " You 're , am I right , Will Harkins ? " " I am , yeah . And you 'd be what exactly ? The sign mentions goblins , so is that - " " Stow the blooming small talk and get to the dire warning , if you please , " piped the unseen goblin . " You have to build up to these things , " said the monkish one , frowning at his partner down below and his eyes flaring yellow . " That 's what they call the old soft sell . Am I right , Harkins ? " " Well , when I was in advertising back in New York it was . Right now , though , I 'd like to know what - " " Okay , here comes the warning , kiddo , " announced the shaggy goblin . He coughed into his shaggy paw . " Do not aid , abet , or otherwise help Heather Moon in any way or - " " Wait , whoa . You guys have got this wrong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the visible goblin . " It 's Heather Moon who , on past occasions , has helped me out of supernatural predicaments . I do n't help her , see , she - " " Tell him about the demons , " urged the falsetto goblin . " I was coming to that , mate . If you so much as help said Heather Moon in any way , shape , or form ... well , buddy boy , huge unseemly demons from the pits of the fiery inferno will come fetch you and you 'll barbecue in the netherworld for all eternity and then some . " " Listen , guys , I have n't even seen Heather Moon for almost three damn years , back when LBJ was still president , " I told them , annoyed . " And that was back in Manhattan . Far as I know she 's still there , married to some bearded stage magician who treats her badly . " " She 's approaching , " warned the unseen goblin . " Let 's scram . " The stool made some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from view . " A word to the wise , Harkins , " he called . The neon sign sputtered , died , and faded away . The word GOBLIN went last . Shimmering , producing a harsh keening , the whole stand then vanished . I watched the fog close in over the spot where the orange had stood . " I 'm sorry about this , Will . " Turning , I saw Heather Moon standing there near the water 's edge . Slim and pretty , wearing jeans and a cablestitch pullover . Her auburn hair was longer and she wore it pulled back and tied with a single twist of scarlet ribbon . " We were just talking about you , " I managed to say . She nodded , smiling faintly . " I came to see you , " she said , moving up across the sand toward me , " because I need your help . " " A minor annoyance ? " I asked . Heather shrugged her left shoulder . " They 're only goblins , " she said . " Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heckle you . " " This went a little way beyond heckling , Heather , " I pointed out . " They were threatening me with eternal damnation , " " That 's one of their stock threats and they , usually , ca n't back it up , " she said . " I would n't , though , eat any of their fruit . " We were sitting in the beam-ceilinged living room of my beach cottage . Looking downhill through the picture window you could see the dark surf come foaming in across the night beach . Shifting in my yellow canvas sling chair , I said , " So goblins are n't what you need my help with ? " Heather was sitting on my low white sofa , holding the cup of cocoa I 'd fixed . " Nope , I have a perfectly good spell that gets rid of goblins , " she assured me . " Which they know full well . " I took a sip of my cocoa . " Before we get to the part where I can be of assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of non-occult questions ? " She smiled . " Divorced , " she said , " nearly two years ago . " " You and Harry Firedrake , Jr. , the stage magician ? " " Him , my only husband so far . " " When you and I got together , briefly , in Manhattan three years ago , the time you helped me rid my life of imps , I thought - " " I remember what happened then , Will , " she said . " And , yes , Harry did n't treat me especially well . That 's why we parted eventually . " " He did n't fight the idea of a divorce ? " " At first , but then my father teleported him to the Gobi Desert for a couple days . When he brought Harry back , he was somewhat subdued . " " Good . " I grinned . " Firedrake seemed like the sort of guy who could do with considerable subduing . One more thing I 'd like to know is - " " Why I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A visit or are - " " I moved out here almost a year ago , " Heather told me . " My Uncle Alfie has a big place in Bayside , near Santa Monica , and I have one wing . Live there , do business from there . " " " Business ? " She stood up , walked over to the window , and gazed out at the night . " Maybe this is why I did n't look you up earlier , Will , " she said quietly . " Because I 'm not exactly using my abilities the way I 'd like to . " She paused , taking a sighing breath in and out . " What I 've done is set up as a sort of psychic consultant . Since I settled in Southern California , I 've built up a darned good client list that includes a lot of wealthy movie people . They depend on me for advice . " I left my chair . " What are you pretending to be , a fortune teller ? " I asked her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your whole familyon both sides-is gifted in a hell of a lot of supernatural ways . You can trace your ancestors back to white-magic sorcerers , wizards - " " I know , I know . But right now I want to set aside enough money so that I can do what I really want to do . " " Which is ? " I moved up behind her , put a hand on her shoulder . " We 'll talk about that later . " She lifted my hand away , turned to face me . " I want to explain the favor I 've come to ask you to do for me . " " Since we met back in college , you 've saved my life twice , " I said . " So I own you a lot , Heather . One favor is sure - " " This is going to take a while to explain . " We sat down beside each other on my sofa . It took Heather over a half hour to tell me what was wrong and what I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lunch with a friend of mine at Moonbaum 's Delicatessen on Sunset in Hollywood . Out through the windows of the place you could see the hazy afternoon , a fine sampling of smog , and an impressive variety of foreign sports cars whizzing by . You 'd find Paul Arkadian in his usual booth most afternoons . At that time Arkadian ran a small and very successful advertising agency with offices on the Sunset Strip . He was noted for producing what they used to call offbeat ads and commercials and was almost as good as Stan Freberg . I think somebody told me a year or so ago that they 'd seen Arkadian 's obit and that he 'd died in a hospice down near San Diego someplace . I lost track of him after I left LA . I thought about sending condolences , but apparently there were no survivors to send them to . Back then I used to see Arkadian a couple times a week . He was one of the few people I could discuss personal , and sometimes strange and unusual , stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latest troubles he was having with his Jaguar XKE . Arkadian was a slim man in his late thirties , with crinkly black hair and dark rings under his eyes . " And she reversed the charges on the long distance call , " he was saying as he forlornly poked at one of his blintzes with his fork . " Has it ever occurred to you that Nicky may not be the girl for you ? " She is n't , we already know that . But when I 'm in the sack with her , I tend to forget past - " " I 'd also be careful of sleeping with a woman who makes her living doing animal imitations for radio spots . " " She 's a gifted actress and voice work is only a stepping stone on the - " " Maybe so , but this is the third time she 's borrowed your Jag and then abandoned it someplace . " " It 's the fourth actually , but who 's counting ? " " Seems to me , Paul , you could find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and yet not borrow your car , take assorted beaus for joy rides , and then abandon the thing at rundown motels in remote sectors of Southern Cal . " " True , but their tits would n't compare with hers . " He took another forlorn bite of his blueberry blintz . I said , " Something unusual came up last night . " New wrinkles formed under Arkadian 's eyes . " Is this a subtle hint that you do n't want to hear any more about my wayward Jaguar ? " " I try to allot only a certain amount of my time each day to the topic , and we 've exceeded that . " " You appear , now that I look at you closely , to be both elated and a mite stunned , " he observed . " The events of last night are responsible ? " Resting my elbows on the tabletop , I said , " Well , it started with the goblins and then , of all people - " " Goblins ? " He hunched , forehead furrowing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tell me they 're after you now . " I eyed him . " The goblins are only a minor annoyance , according to " Deep shit , " pronounced Arkadian forlornly . " If the goblins are harassing you , buddy , you are in deep shit . " " They were trying to sell me orange juice initially , " I said . " But what do you know about goblins ? I 'm the one who usually - " " That 's how I lost the Little Miss Muffin account this spring and my eighteen percent of their $3,000,000-a-year billing , " he confided , lowering his voice , " It sure sounds to me , Will , as though you 've attracted the attention of the Sunset-Dacobra Agency . " I sat up . " You 've heard of them ? " " Have n't you ? " " Not until last night , when Heather - " " They set up shop in Hollywood about eight-nine months ago , very low profile . " My friend paused , glancing around the half empty afternoon deli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They call themselves a talent management organization and their clients include actors , writers , copywriters , advertising execs , and so on . Seems they wanted that Little Miss Muffin account for an ad agency they represented and they started sending goblins around to persuade me to drop it . " " These goblins , so I 'm told , are n't all that dangerous . They 're only the first wave of supernatural - " " I never got beyond that . First they showed up on my doorstep , making snide remarks and threats , " he recounted . " Then they 'd pop up in my bed whilst I was dallying with Nicky . It was damned distracting . They 'd let the air out of my Jag tires . Some nights , just for variety , they 'd put too much air in . I capitulated in about two weeks , quit the account , and I 've been as happy as a clam ever since . Not that clams are very good in the sack . " " So you never met the Dacobras ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under his eyes . " As I told you , buddy , I never got beyond the goblin stage , " he answered . " But from what I was able to learn discreetly-very discreetly-the outfit is run by one Vivian Dacobra , a mature lady in her fifties , and her son , E. Jack Dacobra . I also heard rumors that she 'd made some sort of unsavory deal with the forces of evil . That was about the point when I lost interest in doing further research into Sunset-Dacobra . " I nodded . " Vivian Dacobra is a sorceress , well versed in black magic , " I told him . " Mature she is , since her actual age is around 360 . " " That is mature , yes . Think of all the back Social Security benefits the lady could collect if she admitted her true age , " he observed . " And how the hell , if one may ask , do you know so much about this ? " " That 's what I 've been endeavoring to tell you between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down his fork and I started off by telling him about my goblin visitation of the night before . Then I explained that Heather Moon had come back into my life again . " That 's good , right ? From what you 've told me before , you 've had an abiding yen for this mystical lady for a decade or more . " " Since college , yeah . I dated Heather and she saved me from a bunch of demons . But this time - " " It was right after college that you did that dumb thing , was it not ? " " I married Sue Smith , " I said . " Heather is divorced now , too , and - " " Oops . It just occurs to me that Heather Moon only recurs in your life when you 're either involved or on the brink of being involved with demons , imps , or other unpleasant occult entities . She 's , one might say , an omen of deep shit to come . " " Not this time , though , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help her . " " You do n't practice magic , " he pointed out , " or even do card tricks . " " This has to do , in a way , with my career , sort of . " " Your present career as a screenwriter , you mean ? " " Okay , I 've only sold two movie scripts since I quit writing sitcom scripts , but that 's the career I 'm talking about . " " How 's the latest script coming , by the way ? " " Great . Oskar Quintoon , who heads up Rudigore Productions , loves my second draft even better than the first draft . He 's going to try to get Vincent Price to star in The Cabinet of Count Monstrodamus . " Count Monstrodamus , the notorious eighteenth-century wizard , " he said . " Would that be why Heather Moon paid a call ? " " It is , yeah . She got wind I was working for Quintoon and - " " How 'd she get wind-tarot cards , crystal ball , telepathy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trades , " I said . " The rarest book the count ever wrote is entitled The Most Foul and Evil Black Magic Spells of the Nefarious and Notorious Satan Worshipper , Noneother Than the Vile and Eternally Damned Count Monstrodamus . " " Catchy title . " " The point is there are only three known copies of the book in existence in the entire world , " I continued . " One is in the hands of Vivian Dacobra . By using certain spells that appear only in the count 's book , Vivian has been able to achieve powers even greater than what Heather and all her family can summon up . " " How 'd dear Viv get hold of a copy of such a rare book ? " " Bought one when it first came out in 1797 , " I replied . " There 's one other copy in the British Museum , kept locked away in their Vile and Forbidden Books wing . The only other is in the collection of my producer Oskar Quintoon , who 's got one of the biggest collections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin to see why Heather Moon has reinstated herself in your humdrum life , " Arkadian said . " She needs to consult that book and since you 're both a chum and employee of Quintoon 's , you can get her into his mansion for a peek . " " Well , something like that , yeah , " I admitted . " But we 're also , more or less , friends , too . " " And what does she need from this forbidden book ? " " There 's a spell in the damned thing that , so Heather believes , can cancel most all of Vivian and E. Jack 's powers . " " If she could do that , I could pitch the Little Miss Muffin account again , " he said , brightening . " Just why , though , does Heather Moon want to toss a spanner in the Sunset-Dacobra works ? " " Personal reasons . " " E. Jack make a play for her ? " " Among other things . " " So you intend to escort her over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " He 's having a party at his place in Bel Air tomorrow night . I was invited and I 'm taking Heather , " I said . " She 's got ulterior motives , but I 'm thinking of it as a date . " " Good luck , " he said . " But keep a weather eye out for goblins . " " YOU 'RE SURE you do n't mind our driving to Quintoon 's party ? " I said , guiding my second-hand Mercedes 220S up into Bel Air . This was one of those hot , windy nights , with a rough Santa Ana wind blowing . " Driving as opposed to what ? " Heather asked . She was looking very pretty , wearing a simple black cocktail dress . " Well , you could teleport us or - " " I like to save teleportation for emergencies , " she said , smiling faintly , leaning back in her seat . " I really appreciate your dragging me to this party tonight , Will . None of my other clients happen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hey , I 'm not exactly dragging you . I consider you my date and " We have n't dated since college , " she said . " So this is something of an occasion , huh ? " " All right , okay . I made some mistakes back then , " I acknowledged . " Biggest mistake was to quit seeing you and then marrying Sue Smith . It did n't take me long to realize that was an error of judgment . " " You probably do need a bland , completely conventional girl like Sue , though , do n't you think ? As I recall , your friends and fraternity brothers considered me a very strange girl . " " Screw them , " I said . " I was stupid back then and I 'm glad you 've reappeared in my life . " She smiled . " Well , now that you mention it , so am L " I noticed that in spite of the hot wind , a fog was starting to spill across the winding road . " Has E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she said , " Oh , he was lurking out in the back yard and howling last evening . Uncle Alfie tossed a bucket of water on him , but it did n't help much . And , as you know , I do n't have access to a spell potent enough to send him packing . " " Howling ? What shape did he take ? " " He was a wolf this time , I think . Something large and gray and shaggy . " " He does n't stalk you as himself ? " " Used to , but we got a cease and desist and he had to quit hanging around in his own person , " she explained . " It 's tough , though , to get a restraining order against a wolf or a huge German shepherd . " " You could call the cops . " " We did that a few times , but he always vanishes before they show up . " Slowing the car , I flicked on the windshield wipers . The fog was closing in . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " As I told you the other night , Will , the guy met me at a party in Malibu about three months ago . He started pressuring me to go out with him . I tried to explain I do n't date guys who are devil worshippers and practice the worst kind of black magic . Besides he 's too old . " " How old ? " " Uncle Alfie looked him up in his crystal ball and E. Jack is actually 127 . He is n't really Vivian 's son , though he poses as such . She picked him up in Vienna in the 1890s and they were originally lovers . " " You told me that Vivian wants you to work for her . " " She 's sensed that I 'm a true magician , yes . So she 'd be very pleased if I came to work for Sunset-Dacobra , " she said , hugging herself and shivering once . " The agency is n't big yet , but it 's Vivian 's ambition to control most of Hollywood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You can stop her . " " With the help of that spell in Count Monstrodamus 's book , I 'm pretty sure I can fix her and E. Jack , too . " " Well , you 'll get a look at that soon as .. Oh , Christ . " " Pull over , " she advised . A giant galvanized orange had materialized out of the fog . It was squatting smack in the middle of the road . This time the neon sign read simply BEWARE ! " Why she keeps relying on these dippy goblins I do n't really know . " Heather rolled down the window on her side . From her purse she took a talisman that looked somewhat like a Celtic cross . Holding it out into the fog , she recited , " Begone , foul goblins . Plague us no more . " She recited a few lines of Latin , made a few gestures with the cross . The big metal orange bounced a few times , teetered far to the left . Then it exploded and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mist to squash against my windshield . As the fog lifted , I said , " One hurdle passed . " " The first of many , I 'm afraid , " she said . Heather hesitated on the first step of the curving marble stairway that led up to the front door of Oskar Quintoon 's multilevel glass and redwood mansion . The night wind fluttered her long auburn hair . Behind us an attendant in a gold jacket was driving my Mercedes away toward a parking spot . " You 're certain this is Quintoon 's place ? " Heather asked , taking hold of my arm . " Sure , I 've been here several times , talking about my script for The Cabinet of Count Monstrodamus , " I assured her . " What 's wrong ? " " Maybe nothing . " She shivered again , then gave a resigned shrug . " C'm on , let 's go in . " Slowly we climbed the stairs . I asked , " Did you sense something ? " " I 'm not sure . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just get a look at the book and get the heck out of here . " " We can do that . " I looked at her face and it was very pale . There were well over fifty people already gathered in Quintoon 's immense glass-sided living room . Movie people mostly and a few aerospace execs . At the piano a frail , bald man was playing in a pretty fair imitation of Bud Powell . There was the faint scent of pot in the air and one of Quintoon 's Chinese houseboys was passing around a tray of small , round sandwiches . A lean dark man in a white jacket was acting as bartender over against the far wall . I could n't see Quintoon himself anywhere . Heather 's frown deepened as she said quietly , " Something 's not right . " " All of Quintoon 's parties look like this . " The houseboy approached us . " Lobster salad sandwich , Mr. Harkins ? " I started to reach for one , then noticed that his right thumb , which was gripping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprout fur and take on a distinct goblin appearance . " No , thanks . I 'm allergic to seafood actually . " " And you , Miss Moon ? " " Pass . " Her grip on my arm tightened . Leaning close to her , I said , " I 'm commencing to agree with you about something going on wrong . " She said , " These are not really the guests . The Dacobras have taken over somehow and substituted their own . " " Meaning this is a trap for you . " " For both of us , I 'm afraid . " Nodding , I suggested , " Suppose we , very casually , make our way up to Quintoon 's library on the second level ? We 'll grab the Count Monstodamus book and scram . " " We may not even have time for that chore , Will . " By now we were in the middle of the living room . I noticed , which did n't cheer me at all , that the fellow at the piano had green scaly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Powell , though . Up at the top of the curving indoor staircase a dark-haired , very pale woman in a scarlet cloak had appeared . She was vaguely handsome and looked to be in her mid-fifties . " Vivian Dacobra ? " I inquired . " Herself , " answered Heather . " Okay , I 'm going to teleport us clean out of here . Hang on . " " Must you two leave so soon ? " asked Vivian Dacobra . Everyone else fell silent . The huge lizard quit playing the piano , the goblin ceased passing out little sandwiches . The bartender had shed his skin and off in the shadowy corners some of the guests were reverting to their true shapes . After reciting a few phrases of what I think was ancient Greek , Heather whispered , " Here we go . " The party began to blur . I saw sudden crackling zigzags of multicolored light and felt as though I was smack in the center of a huge animated Stuart Davis painting . My ears popped . Light was replaced by darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my low white sofa back home in my beach cottage . " That 's terrific , Heather , " I said , laughing with relief . " You got us out of .... " Then I realized she had n't returned with me . I was alone . I WAITED another five minutes , increasingly certain that Heather was n't going to show up . Then I called her home phone , although it was doubtful she 'd teleported there instead of here . I hung up after the sixth ring . " They got her , " I said . " She was able to get me out , but they stopped her . " Heather 'd given me her telephone number , but not that of her Uncle Alfie . I was asking the operator for Bayside information when I heard coat hangers , shoeboxes , and paperback books rattling and tumbling in my hall closet . Pronging the phone , I took a deep breath and , gingerly , went into the hallway . " I 'm really not in the mood for any more goblins , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my boy . We 're in absolute accord on that . " The door was pushed open . " Matter of fact , I 'm growing weary of lycanthropes , too . " He was a heavyset man , about the same height as I was . He had a plump pinkish face and very wavy white hair . " Who might you be ? And , more importantly , how 'd you get in my closet ? " " Poor aim , " he answered . " I was intending to materialize in your parlor , Will , my lad . " " You teleported here ? " " Exactly , yes . It 's gratifying to find someone who takes supernatural manifestations in his stride and does n't stand around gaping and - " " Then you 're probably Uncle Alfie . " " That 's absolutely who I am , " he confirmed , stepping fully out onto the hall carpeting . " Heather 's beloved uncle and mentor . " " I was just trying to phone you . To tell you that - " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoner in their Moorish style mansion in Beverly Hills . " " I did n't know that last part . " " That 's because you do n't have a crystal ball . " Uncle Alfie reached into his crowded coat pocket and produced a tennis ball . " No , that 's not it . I thought it felt too fuzzy . " He tried another pocket and , after retrieving a handful of assorted jawbreakers , located a palm-fitting crystal . He winced as he held it up toward me . " Thing 's been overheating lately . " I pointed at it . " You can see where Heather is in that thing ? " " Certainly , my boy , " he answered . " Once I became aware of her fate , I felt it was expedient to consult with you . " " Vivian Dacobra stopped her somehow from teleporting back here with me , " I explained to Heather 's uncle . " I 'm not sure what they have in - " " They are , at this very moment , trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She 'll never do that . " " It 's unlikely , " he agreed , " but they 'll do some pretty vile things while striving to convince her . Eventually , I fear , they 'll destroy her . " " So how do we rescue her ? " " We have to procure a copy of the spell in Count Monstrodamus 's vile book . " He headed into my living room , seated himself on the low white sofa . " As you know , Oskar Quintoon has a copy . " I followed him into the room . " Heather and I did n't get a chance to consult it , but if you and I go back there - " " Alas , no , lad . Vivian and E. Jack left all the real guests in trances down in the wine cellar , " he informed me , " and also swiped your producer 's copy of the book . " " Okay , Heather says there 's another copy in the British Museum , " I said , starting to pace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " " Not unless , " he said , shaking his head , " I see it first and get a look at the exact location . " " Okay , then you can teleport yourself over to London , take a look , swipe the book by magical means , and get the hell back here . " " I 'm afraid I can no longer span continents , not to mention oceans , in a single hop , Will , " Uncle Alfie sadly informed me . " Fact is , I have n't made a transatlantic hop in nearly five years . Not since the time I aimed for Paris and ended up bobbing in the surf off one of the lesser Azore Islands . " " Then why did you come to see me ? We have to do something to rescue Heather and so far , Uncle Alfie , all you 're giving me is - " " Have faith , my boy , " he said . " I had a premonition that coming here was the thing to do . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bastards are torturing Heather and - " " Ah , hold on , Will . " He gestured in the direction of my telephone . " This phone call is exactly what we 're waiting for . " " What phone call ? " The phone rang and I grabbed it up . " Yeah ? " " How did the party go , buddy ? " inquired Arkadian . " Did you and Miss Moon get hold of that copy of the Count Monstrodamus book ? " " No , but why are you - " " There 's another copy here . " " You ca n't be at the British Museum ? " " Nope , I 'm attending the birthday party of Lawrence J. Bannerman , publisher of Hollywood Horrors Magazine , " replied my friend . " He collects all sorts of horror ephemera and - " " There are only three copies of that book in the world . " " Three originals , sure . But what Bannerman owns is a Photostat copy made for him , on the sly , by the rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is terrific news , Paul . I 'll explain why later , " I told him . " Tell Bannerman we 'll be right over to take a look at it . Where 's the guy live ? " Arkadian gave us a Pasadena address , adding , " That 's near the route of the Rose Bowl parade . " " I 'll watch out for stray floats . See you as soon as possible . " " Perhaps , " suggested Heather 's white-haired uncle , " I can teleport the two of us to Pasadena . " " Your aim has n't been all that great lately , " I reminded . " We 'll drive . Oops ! My car 's still at Quintoon 's . " " No problem , " he said . " I 'll teleport it back here for you . " Shortly before the fog started closing in I said , " You probably should n't have torn that page out of the book . " " It was the most expedient way to acquire the spell we need , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racing against time , keep in mind . " " You took time to visit the john while we were at Bannerman 's . " " Frequent visits are a necessity at my age . " " You could simply have copied the spell . Matter of fact , while you were - " " I can never read my own handwriting . " We were driving higher up into Beverly Hills and the mist was starting to surround my car . " You think maybe this fog is a prelude to goblins ? " He made an annoyed noise . " Probably so , since we 're less than a half mile from the Dacobra manse and - " Mushy fruit-oranges , apples , and something prickly I could n't identify-started sailing out of the night to whap my hood and windshield . " Reminds me of my brief career in vaudeville , " observed Uncle Alfie . He located a stick of incense in the breast pocket of his coat . He rolled open the window , lit the incense with a wood match and tossed the smoking stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Heather prefers using a traditional spell , but I find the little buggers ca n't stand this particular odor . " He shut the window . The pelting with fruit ceased , the mist rose up into the night and vanished . " Drive up around the back of the joint , " advised Heather 's uncle . " They 're anticipating us , but it 's easier to sneak in via the back way . And there 's much less broken glass on the rear wall . " WE GOT OVER the wall , and the broken glass , with relative ease . Uncle Alfie simply levitated both of us and we floated gently up and over the eight-foot adobe wall . I 'd never been levitated before and it produced , briefly , some stomach cramps . Soon as we landed on the wooded half-acre behind the two-story red tile and stucco house , hounds began barking and growling quite nearby . Their approaching footfalls shook the ground as they came pounding through the brush toward us . There were three . Two were dark hounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The third was an extremely large snarling gray German shepherd . " The one with the collar is E. lack , " Uncle Alfie pointed out , raising both arms out in front of him . " Let me handle him . " From my coat I took the spell I 'd copied from The Most Foul and Evil Black Magic Spells of the Nefarious and Notorious Satan Worshipper , Noneother Than the Vile and Eternally Damned Count Monstrodamus while Uncle Alfie had been in the bathroom . Snapping my fingers , I got E. Jack 's attention . So much so that he came galloping straight at me . There was n't much moonlight , but by squinting I was able to recite the spell . It was in , I 'm nearly certain , a mixture of Greek and Persian . Count Monstrodamus had helpfully provided a pronunciation guide after each word . E. Jack , in his hound form , was leaping for my throat , fangs bared , as I read the final phrase . He seemed to halt in midair , then he yelped and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , he produced some whimpering . " Nice boy , " I said , bending and rubbing his stomach . " Go over and sit by the potting shed for a while . " Panting , E. Jack rose up and went trotting off . " Admirable job , my boy , " said Heather 's uncle . " I happened to notice another spell in the count 's book , " I explained . " Guaranteed to keep E. Jack locked in his hound format forever . And also make him docile and obedient . " " Very efficient reading of the spell , although you pronounced a few of the Portuguese words incorrectly . Worked anyway . " I glanced around . " What happened to the other two dogs ? " " Oh , they were hellhounds , demonic dogs from the lower depths , " he said . " I exploded them by sprinkling each with an old Egyptian elixir that I carry around for just such emergencies . They exploded with considerable fireworks . " " I guess I was too preoccupied with hexing E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pocket , he said , " Now let 's double-check on dear Heather 's location . " The crystal ball lit up , glowing a pale bluish white . An image of Heather took shape . She was lying , apparently unconscious , on an ornate brass bed in a white-walled room . Uncle Alfie held up the crystal to me for a moment before stuffing it back into his pocket . " Second floor bedroom around on the side of this pest hole . " He started trotting in that direction . I caught up with him beside a large plashing fountain . A marble sea nymph was toting a dolphin who was spewing water enthusiastically into the fishpond below . " We 'll try a variation on the old floating lady stunt , " decided Heather 's portly uncle as he raised both arms and pointed all ten fingers in the direction of an unlit second floor window . I heard a muffled rattling , then the wrought iron grillwork guarding the window came popping free to tumble down to the dark grass and bounce once . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , in a stiff horizontal position , Heather came floating out into the night . Her unconscious body hovered up there , then gradually drifted down toward me . " Catch her , my boy . " I did and she murmured faintly but did not awaken . " What 's wrong with her ? " I asked . " The same thing , dear heart , that shall soon be wrong with you two oafs . " Silently Vivian Dacobra had materialized on the other side of the gurgling fountain . She was wearing a night-blue cloak and her lean face glowed white . " I feel compelled to warn you , madam , " began Uncle Alfie as he dug into one of his cluttered pockets , " that unless you leave Greater Los Angeles , after first freeing my dear niece from this foul spell , I shall be forced to - " " Up your snoot , you old bastard . " " Me old ? Ironic that someone who 's lived several centuries since her first birthday should - " " The spell , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Got it here someplace . " He was still rummaging in a pocket . Laughing , Vivian raised her left hand . " You 'll all make excellent employees for Sunset-Dacobra , " she announced . " You , Harkins , we can utilize as a typist and stenographer . The old gent might - " " Ah , here it is . " Unfolding the borrowed page , he commenced reciting . This spell included Latin , Middle English , Persian and , maybe , a little Portuguese . " Do you honestly believe that such a trite amalgam of outmoded mumbo jumbo can possibly .... " Vivian paused , lowering her hand and clutching at her midsection . A look of pain was spreading across her pale white face . " Reach into my coat pocket , " urged Uncle Alfie out of the side of his mouth . " We 'd best sprinkle some rosemary and thyme on the old girl at this point . Placing Heather gently on the dark grass , I poked into one of his pockets and came out with a small cylindrical bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we need . Apply it , quick . " He continued reciting the Count Monstrodamus spell . Twisting off the bottle lid , I skirted the fountain and tossed a handful of the herbs at the now doubled-up sorceress . When the flecks hit her cloak dazzling sparks were given off . Vivian sank to her knees . Uncle Alfie reached the conclusion of the spell and lowered the borrowed page to glance across at Vivian . " I 'll put , " she said in a thin , gasping voice , " a curse on all .. all .... " She fell against the fountain . When her head hit the marble edge of the pond , it made unsettling crackling sounds . Wrinkles began spreading across her face . Her skin grew brittle and began to flake . Then she started to disintegrate , turning to a foul-smelling pile of dust that the night wind blew into the water and across the grass . " When three hundred years catches up with you , " observed Uncle Alfie , folding up the spell , " it really catches up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her ? " I asked , kneeling beside her . She sat up . " I 'm okay , " she told me , reaching out to hug me . " Once Vivian was gone , the spell she put on me ended . " I put my arms around her . " I 'm glad of that . " " I 'm sort of pleased myself , " she said , kissing me on the cheek . " And thanks for coming to rescue me . " " I had a little help from your Uncle Alfie . " " Even so , " she said , smiling . I leaned closer and kissed her . " Ah , I truly love these romantic endings , " said Uncle Alfie , sighing .
