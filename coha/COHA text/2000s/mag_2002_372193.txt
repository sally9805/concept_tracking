Toppling dictator Saddam Hussein has been a Bush Administration goal from the start , and the war drums were beating louder than ever last week . Administration hard-liners said Dick Cheney 's upcoming trip to the Middle East will build a coalition for action . Even moderate Colin Powell told the Senate that " a regime change would be in the best interests of the region . And we are looking at a variety of options that would bring that about . " <P> Still , many of the obstacles to ousting Saddam remain . Some Bush advisers believe a force of just hundreds of U.S. troops bolstering local insurgents could spark a nationwide drive to topple Saddam . But many uniformed officers say it would take between 200,000 and 500,000 troops to assure his downfall . And getting that many soldiers into Iraq would not be easy . Neither Saudi Arabia nor Turkey , likely key launching points for an attack , is eager to help . <P> Another problem for would-be invaders is how to deter Saddam from launching any biological , chemical or radiological weapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saddam feels it 's the end , the constraints that acted on him last time would n't this time , " says an Israeli diplomat . Israeli leader Ariel Sharon expressed this fear to Bush during his visit to Washington earlier this month . <P> And even if U.S. forces could spread unrest and limit Saddam 's retaliation , there is no one waiting in the wings to take power in Baghdad . One candidate is Ahmad Chalabi , Shi'a leader of the Iraqi National Congress , an opposition group in exile . But Chalabi has little personal following inside Iraq , is distrusted by many U.S. officials and is opposed by key Arab states like Saudi Arabia . Washington is increasingly looking for an exiled Sunni from Saddam 's professional army to rally the country against him . An emerging candidate is Nazar Khazraji , a former Iraqi chief of staff who defected in 1996 and is living in Copenhagen . Khazraji can rally the professional military against Saddam , experts say , and would reassure the Saudis and others that Iraq wo n't fragment into Shi'ite and Kurdish enclaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power in Iraq create problems for him . A court in Copenhagen is considering bringing war-crimes charges against Khazraji for the massacre of Kurds in northern Iraq in the late 1980s . Khazraji says the blame for the massacres lies entirely with Saddam . <P>  --  By Massimo Calabresi , with reporting by Scott MacLeod/Cairo and Mark Thompson/Washington
