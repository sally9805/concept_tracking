<p> HOW much is your life worth ? How about a year of life ? How much is your vision worth ? What about being pain-free ? Able to walk unassisted ? Have sex ? <p> Unanswerable questions all . Or maybe not . <p> Economists are sometimes accused of knowing the prices of everything and the value of nothing . Now they are trying to answer what may be the most difficult question of all  --  the price of health . <p> The exercise has enormous real-world implications that are reverberating as health care technology becomes more expensive and health care spending becomes a bigger burden on companies , taxpayers and patients . The price of health is part of the calculus in determining whether a new medicine or treatment is worth the cost . <p> While making such determinations may seem unsavory , some countries , including Britain , are explicitly using the cost-effectiveness of treatments in deciding what drugs to cover . Even in the United States , where there is a general reluctance to limit health care based on a treatment 's expense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " The reality is we have to make these comparisons , and we either do them implicitly or explicitly , " said Dana Goldman , director of health economics at the RAND Corporation , a nonprofit research institute in Santa Monica , Calif . <p> To make the process more explicit , economists want to compare the cost-effectiveness of different treatments in a single measurement , one that doctors and policy makers will trust enough to use . <p> So , how much is your life worth ? You may think the answer is infinity , that no amount of money could compensate you for the loss of your life . <p> But people do put a price tag on their existence . Workers accept riskier jobs for higher pay , for example . And the rich tend to think their lives are worth more than poor people 's . <p> Studies of real-world situations produce relatively consistent results , suggesting that average Americans value a year of life at $100,000 to $300,000 , said Peter J. Neumann , director of a program at Tufts-New England Medical Center that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment provides another data point to suggest that estimate is fair . Keeping a patient with kidney failure alive on dialysis costs about $70,000 per year , according to a federally financed survey of dialysis clinics . But no one has suggested that dialysis is too expensive or that it should be limited . <p> So a year of life is worth at least $100,000 . <p> But that figure only begins to answer the question of what health is worth . Dialysis saves lives directly . But most medical care has a more modest goal : back surgery is performed to relieve the pain of a herniated disk , and drugs are given to lift depression or end an asthma attack more quickly . Those treatments are meant to improve  --  not necessarily to save  --  lives . Can their value actually be compared ? <p> Yes , say health care economists , who have created the " quality-adjusted life year . " The idea is that a year in perfect health is worth more  --  both to the patient and to society  --  than a year spent in pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse ? Losing one eye or both ears ? Constant back pain or severe asthma ? Late-stage diabetes or congestive heart failure ? <p> To get the answer , these economists have developed several tests . The simplest and most elegant is called the standard gamble . People are asked to imagine having the symptoms of a certain disease  --  the pain , loss of function and shortened life expectancy . ( Economists try to avoid using the specific name of the disease when they are describing it because some diseases , especially cancer , provoke disproportionately negative responses . ) <p> Then the people are told that an operation exists that would cure them . But if the operation fails , the patient will die . <p> Under those circumstances , what odds of failure will the sick person tolerate ? The higher the odds , the worse the disease . For example , a survey of people with severe diabetes , including blindness , found that they would accept the operation even if there were only a 42 percent chance they would survive , according to a registry compiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other words , these patients would , on average , accept a better than 50-50 chance of immediate death to be rid of their condition . Patients who had suffered a severe stroke carried an even more negative view of their condition . <p> On the other hand , people with severe sleep apnea  --  which causes them to wake up repeatedly during the night and requires them to wear a breathing mask in bed  --  were much more willing to live with the disease than stroke or diabetes patients were . The apnea patients would accept an operation only if their chances of dying were no higher than about 10 percent . <p> Economists put these conditions on a simple scale , with a year in perfect health scored at 1 . Death is scored at 0 , but 0 is not the lowest point on the scale . A person who is in intractable pain , bedridden , depressed and unable to care for himself could have a score below 0 , because many people would rather be dead than living with those problems . <p> Economists acknowledge that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of different ways of eliciting this information , and depending on how it 's done and who you ask , you get different numbers , " said Emmett B. Keeler , a math professor and specialist in health care economics at RAND . <p> Many sick people , for example , adapt surprisingly well to their conditions , Dr. Keeler said . As a result , those who are actually sick tend to be more tolerant of their diseases  --  and less willing to gamble their lives on a cure  --  than healthy people who are asked to imagine having a disease . <p> " People are terrible at doing this , " said Richard M. Suzman , director of the behavioral and social research program at the National Institute on Aging . " There are data that show that people overestimate the impact of spinal cord injuries compared to people who 've actually had them . " <p> Despite these caveats , economists insist that the estimates have value , at least as guides to the diseases and conditions that people will spend the most to avoid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weather like ? ' " said David Cutler , a professor of economics at Harvard and author of " Your Money or Your Life : Strong Medicine for America 's Health-Care System . " " There 's no firm answer , but pretty much everyone would agree that some days are nicer than other days . " <p> Once they know how to rank the " costs " of various diseases , economists can determine the worthiness of a particular treatment . To do so , they use the " quality-adjusted life-year , " or QALY . <p> The idea of QALY is to put a value on treatments that may not save lives but improve them . For example , if a blind person 's quality of life is " worth " 0.75 points per year , a treatment that would restore him to perfect vision  --  and raise his quality of life to 1 per year  --  is worth 0.25 per year of life . If the person lived another 30 years , the treatment would be worth 7.5 QALYs , or 30 times 0.25 . <p> With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 patients on dialysis  --  whose lives are also " worth " 0.75 points per year  --  alive for a year . <p> In theory , QALYs offer a single figure that can measure value of every treatment , from drugs to surgeries to preventive care , like vaccines and cancer screenings . <p> Once they know how many QALYs a treatment is worth , economists can figure out its cost per QALY  --  the broadest measure of the cost-effectiveness of health care . <p> For example , what does screening for colon cancer really cost ? First , divide the cost per screening by the probability that a screening will find cancer to determine the cost of a cancer diagnosis . Then divide that figure by the number of QALYs lost in an average case of colon cancer . <p> And as any gastroenterologist will you , because screening is relatively cheap and colon cancer is expensive and difficult to treat , colon cancer screening turns out to be something of a bargain , at $10,000 to $25,000 per quality-adjusted life year  --  at most , one-third the cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to choose between dialysis and colon cancer screening , most economists would suggest it pick screening . <p> But the United States has never accepted that health care should be rationed , or that new treatments should not be covered simply because they are expensive . That attitude has led to coverage for technologies like the left-ventricular assist device , a wildly expensive way to help failing hearts pump blood more usefully . <p> Costing as much as $1.4 million per QALY , the device is an enormous use of resources . Some new cancer medicines are also inefficient , extending the lives of very sick patients by a few weeks at a cost of tens of thousands of dollars per case , or several hundred thousand dollars per QALY . <p> Meanwhile , some people without insurance do not have access to cholesterol-lowering drugs , which cost just a few thousand dollars per QALY when they are prescribed to patients who have a high risk of heart attack . <p> Such inefficiencies contribute to the high cost of American health care , economists say . They argue that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead of other countries , notably Britain , and begin to examine cost-per-QALY explicitly when it considers the coverage of new treatments . <p> " When we go and buy health care , we have no idea how much health we 're going to get for a dollar , " said Dr. Goldman of RAND . " And if we had this just right , we 'd know how much health we 're going to get . You 're not really interested in buying health care  --  you 're interested in buying health . That 's what this is trying to do . " <p> Still , Dr. Goldman said that using QALYs would work only if policy makers use them as guides and do not make decisions on the basis of efficiency . In some cases , like new cancer treatments , Americans simply do not want to consider cost , he said . <p> " They 're incredibly expensive and do n't work so well , " Dr. Goldman said of the cancer drugs . " But Americans have said they want these things . We like to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ #
