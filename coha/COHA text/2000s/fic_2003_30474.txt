TUESDAY , APRIL 27 , 1891 Unlike Bierce , my friend Father Flanagan , of Old St. Mary 's Cathedral , applauded my piece on the slave girls , and said to me , " I will introduce you to a person who is actually doing something about the plight of those unfortunate children . " Miss Eliza Lindley , directress of the Protestant Stockton Street Mission , was seated at a cluttered desk beneath an elaborate sign that announced : I CAN DO ALL THINGS THROUGH CHRIST WHICH STRENGTHENETH ME . Upstairs was the cheerful racket of the girls the Mission had saved from slavery- " at study , " which sounded more like play to me . Miss Lindley wore severe black-rimmed eyeglasses , a white shirtwaist , and her light brown hair drawn into a bun . She smelled of soap . She ran this place with an iron hand , Father Flanagan had told me . She was a New Englander of granite conscience and devotion to her cause . " Thank you for your piece in the Examiner , Mr. Redmond , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was very encouraging to our work here . " " Saving Chinese children 's souls , " I said . " And their bodies , Mr. Redmond . " It was the Mission 's work to rescue the enslaved children who were worked to the bone by cruel masters and mistresses . She admitted an inability to deal with those who had been imported as the most degraded of prostitutes . Some of their powerful masters were reputed to be white men , and their guardians were armed highbinders . She was assisted by a teacher of English , Miss Cochran , and a Chinese interpreter . The girls were instructed in American homemaking and female responsibilities in preparation for marriage with reputable gentlemen of their race . I wanted tosee her in action , if that was possible , and she quickly assented . So we went for a walk through the noisy streets of Chinatown , with its powerful smells and brilliant colors and exotic mix of the foreign and the familiar . Miss Lindley seemed very much at home here , in her tight tweed jacket and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face a severe expression , and now she looked eager , expectant , and quite pretty , with her high cheekbones and vivid blue eyes . I had to stretch my steps to match the confident stride of her polished black boots . We halted by a basement entrance beneath an herbalist 's shop , where a wraith of a girl was chopping wood . She looked nine or ten , in a filthy white shift , her hair in two untidy braids . She balanced a piece of log on its end , grasped her hatchet with both hands , and brought it down to split off a sliver of the wood . She glanced up at Miss Lindley and quickly away . " They will claim she is their daughter , " Miss Lindley said , as we strode on . " She is not , of course . Did you notice the burns on her arms where they have tortured her ? " " I 'm afraid I did not . " " I beg of you that you did , " Miss Lindley said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Does she know who you are ? " I asked . " She knows , " Miss Lindley said . In Judge Tallent 's office in Old City Hall I cheerfully perjured myself . A search warrant was issued , a patrolman provided . His name was Perkin and he seemed to be an old friend of Miss Lindley 's . With Miss Lindley leading the way almost at a trot , Perkin hustling behind her in his eight-button blue uniform , we returned to the herbalist 's shop . Miss Lindley threw open the basement door . Here were pots boiling over wood fires , in a powerful steaming-vegetable stench . We made our way past clotheslines and hanging garments . A sour-faced Chinaman with a gray beard appeared , calling out , " This velly good house ! You go way , Missy Lingling ! " I knew that many of these storefronts concealed gambling establishments and opium dens . Miss Lindley proceeded along a dim passage , sliding her hands over wooden paneling , stooping and stretching . Finally she found something . " Perkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket , inserted it into a crack , and levered a panel open . Miss Lindley was first inside : a dim room with a lamp burning , a fan-tan layout on a teakwood table , a human squeaking sound . The Chinese child detached herself from an old woman and flung herself into Miss Lindley 's arms . " Perkin ! Mr. Redmond ! " Miss Lindley said . " Observe that she wears no jewelry . They will come after her for theft . " We observed . The old woman shrieked at us in Chinese . We departed with the child clinging to Miss Lindley 's skirts , this time with Perkin bringing up the rear flourishing his iron bar . We made our way past the malodorous pots and into the light and air . " My God , Miss Lindley , " I called to her . " Do you do this often ? " " She do , mister , " Perkin said . Back at the Mission , Miss Lindley showed me the red welts of a recent beating on the child 's painfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a motherly Chinese woman who rattled at her in her own language and escorted her from the room . Miss Lindley seated herself behind the desk again . A few strands of hair had come loose from her tightly combed coif ; her scrubbed face was bright with triumph . " Well , Mr. Redmond , " she said . " Have you enjoyed our foray ? " " Indeed I have ! " " May I summon you if this comes to court ? " " You may . " " And what will you write of us here at the Mission ? " " Just what I have observed . " " Always there is a shortage of money , " Miss Lindley said . " Our faithful lawyer , Mr. Duggan , is on one of his infamous drunks again . So we must hire another , who does not serve for the love of a worthy cause . " I asked if I might escort her to dinner . She directed me to a nearby restaurant replete with golden dragons and red flags . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We became friends . I saw that she liked the people among whom she worked , and was loved in return , though I had no doubt she was hated by others . I thought she lived a dangerous life , and one of service to a cause , beyond that of anyone else I knew . At that time I did not know that she often carried a revolver in her reticule . " And were you impressed with Miss Lindley ? " Father Flanagan inquired when I met him in the vestry at St. Mary 's the next day . He was a short , balding young man in a black cassock with a face so sympathetic you knew that forgiveness was built into his soul . I said I had been very impressed indeed . " She is a natural wonder . " " She is , unfortunately , a Protestant wonder . She is truly saving souls , Tom , and I do have an impression there is the True Faith somewhere in her background . You must help me to cultivate her . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , I meant . " I wish it did . I 'm afraid it requires an indomitable and truly blessed lady such as Miss Lindley . Those poor children trust her ; they all know her by some underground railroad of communication . She risks her life , you see . She is offending powerful tong forces . " " I have told her I will write of our adventure , " I said . " You have her permission ? " " I have . " But I wondered how Sam Chamberlain would view my topic .
