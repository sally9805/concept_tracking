<p> Tucson , Ariz.  --  The cases grabbed headlines : Ten police officers indicted on charges ranging from drugs , to aggravated assault to child molestation . An off-duty officer shot to death  --  apparently while trying to rob a convicted felon . <p> The year was 1996 , and elected officials in Tucson debated the same question that is now being asked in DeKalb County and Atlanta : <p> Who should watch the police ? <p> Ultimately , Tucson adopted a civilian review board and a professional auditor . <p> As Atlanta and DeKalb County contemplate forming civilian review boards , Tucson 's board provides a glimpse of how this process might  --  or might not  --  work here . <p> In Tucson , even those providing the oversight seem divided on their effectiveness . <p> The professional auditor , Liana Perez , a former tax and civil rights investigator , has unlimited access to ongoing internal investigations and also may attend meetings of police internal review boards , which determine whether shootings by officers were justified . Tucson police shot to death three suspects last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witnesses are questioned thoroughly and that all issues are considered , Perez said . <p> The civilian review board can examine files on any civilian 's complaint once the internal investigations are finished , and that keeps police on their toes , said Cindy Schiesel , who chairs the board . <p> But some board members have been frustrated by what they see as the board 's failure to address important controversies , such as complaints from anti-war demonstrators who often have conflicts with counter-demonstrators at a weekly protest outside a military recruiting station on the city 's busiest highway . <p> " In my opinion , we 're a paper tiger , " said board member Michael Elsner . " We have no teeth . " <p> A sampling of complaints <p> On a warm Tucson evening , 17 people sat around a horseshoe of folding tables in the Joel D. Valdez Main Library . <p> Most of the participants were civilians , but they dug into details of police procedure as they reviewed a sampling of citizen complaints selected by their chairman : <p> * Could an officer have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ? <p> * Did the department try hard enough to verify the complaint of a suspect who said an officer cursed him ? <p> * Should n't an officer have moved away from the doorway of a woman who complained the officer 's interview with a witness was disturbing her ? <p> Board members accepted most of the explanations offered by police representatives seated with them , though the seven voting board members unanimously gave a negative vote to one investigation they regarded as incomplete . <p> After an hour and 45 minutes , the board 's public work was over . <p> The six people in the audience  --  including the police union president , at least two other police employees and an Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter  --  quietly filed out . Board members would meet again in another month . <p> Despite the scant attendance that night , Schiesel said she believes the oversight has given more attention to citizen complaints . <p> That level of oversight , along with strict policies of the police chief , have helped get rid of the " bad cops , " Schiesel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any complaint encourages police to thoroughly investigate all complaints , she explained . <p> " I think the board has tremendous value , " said Schiesel , a retired high school teacher . <p> But Elsner said the board has been too timid . <p> " It 's a good thing that the chief of police is responsive to what we recommend , but there 's no feedback loop that I 've seen since I 've been on the board , " said Elsner , the president of the Tucson-based Institute for Social Justice , who joined the board one year ago . <p> There is no organized way for the board or the public to track results , said Elsner , who complained that the board 's last annual report failed to tell the public how many cases it considered  --  and the disposition of each . <p> Last year , people who came to a board meeting to complain about policing of the anti-war demonstrations were not allowed to speak , apparently because a city attorney misinterpreted the board 's rules . <p> Schiesel  --  and the city attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board 's job is to review citizen complaints , not to try to direct the police department 's response to incidents such as the anti-war protests . <p> A good investment <p> Members of the civilian review board are unpaid , but Perez , the police department 's independent auditor , is a full-time city employee . <p> She and her full-time staff have access to all internal affairs investigations . <p> They can even take part in witness interviews , including interviews with officers accused of misconduct or involved in shootings . <p> Perez originally had one assistant , but in 2003 she also took over the equal opportunity office , giving her 12 employees to handle both functions . <p> Police oversight costs are not calculated separately , but the combined office 's proposed budget this year is about $800,000 . <p> Perez thinks it has been a good investment , even though she does not have the subpoena power envisioned for the proposed civilian review board in Atlanta . Advocates of a civilian board in DeKalb also favor subpoena power . <p> " It has worked well for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter if I 'm not doing an investigation , my questions are getting asked . " <p> By most accounts , Tucson has avoided the problems of boards in other cities that wound up at odds with police . <p> In Portland , Ore. , for example , city leaders replaced the civilian board with a professional auditor after clashes between the board and the police department , which did n't think the board knew enough about police work . <p> It helps , said Larry Lopez , president of the Tucson Police Officers Association , that members of the civilian review board attend the " citizen police academy " to learn police procedures and that they take " ride-alongs " with officers . <p> " They understand there are times we need to put our hands on people , " Lopez said . " There are times we need to raise our voices at people . " <p> Atlanta to go further <p> Atlanta 's civilian review board will have greater authority to delve into police operations than the Tucson board , said City Councilman H. Lamar Willis , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooting last year of elderly Kathryn Johnston in a botched drug raid . <p> The board will have the authority to comment on police budgets , officer pay and polices and procedures , he said . <p> " So the idea is to make this body more pro-active than reactive , " Willis said . <p> In DeKalb County , John Evans , president of the anti-discrimination group Operation LEAD , is circulating a proposal for an elected civilian review board after a spate of fatal police shootings of suspects . <p> Evans wants the board to have subpoena power and the ability to follow any information it turns up . <p> " We certainly would n't want any witch-hunting , " he said , " but I think when you 've got subpoena power , there are things that will come out .
