<p> ANACORTES , Wash .  --  Isabelle and Natalie , ages 8 and 10 , have at least six sets of grandparents and great-grandparents , depending on how you count in these days of blended families . <p> Today , the U.S. Supreme Court will hear the plea of one set of paternal grandparents who have been determined to play a bigger role in their grandchildren 's lives since their son , the girls ' father , died in 1993 . <p> The question before the court is whether grandparents have the right to spend time with their grandchildren , even when parents object . The case could be decided narrowly by the justices . But it also could lead to a definition of what constitutes a family and decide what weight should be given the rights of parents , grandparents and the children caught in the middle . <p> " We just want to let Natalie and Isabelle know they have an extended family out here that loves them , " says grandmother Jenifer Troxel , 59 . " We have eight other grandchildren , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was welcome at first , says the girls ' mother , Tommie Granville Wynn , but soon it became overbearing . As she prepared to marry and form a new family , she limited the grandparents ' visits to once a month and nixed any overnight stays . <p> The girls " were 2 and 4 , and we did n't want any overnight visits , " says Wynn , who never married the Troxels ' son , Brad , but lived with him for two years . " That 's what our counselor recommended . . . . We were trying to build a new family . " <p> By the end of 1993 , the dispute had moved into the courts , and it 's been there ever since . A trial court ruled in 1995 that the Troxels could have one visit a month , from Saturday afternoon through Sunday afternoon , plus one week during the summer and four hours on each granddaughter 's birthday . <p> In 1997 , a state appeals court reversed that decision . Then , in December 1998 , in a resounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5-4 to invalidate the state 's visitation statute because it violated parents ' constitutional rights . <p> " A parent 's constitutionally protected right to rear his or her children without state interference has been recognized as a fundamental liberty interest , " the state court said . " Parents have a right to limit the visitation of their children with other persons . " <p> In the past year , the Troxels say , they have seen Isabelle twice and Natalie once . <p> The case seemed an unremarkable custody dispute here in bucolic northwestern Washington , an hour north of Seattle . But it took on new importance last September when the U.S. Supreme Court , which usually defers to state courts on family matters , stunned observers by agreeing to take up the issue . <p> Charged case <p> " Here they really jumped into state family law in a very , very sensitive area , " says University of Texas law professor Sanford Levinson , who is teaching this year at New York University . " However they decide , a lot of people are going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spend their political capital on this one . " <p> " It 's easy to see how politically charged issues of custody and parental rights are in this country , " Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe says . " Just look at that little boy in Miami " who is caught in an international custody battle involving the United States and Cuba . <p> With the mother and the grandparents in the audience today , the nine justices  --  six of them grandparents themselves  --  will hear arguments from Seattle attorneys on both sides . Family law specialist Mark Olson for the grandparents and appellate lawyer Catherine Smith for Wynn each will get 30 minutes . A decision is expected by July . <p> The fact that so many justices are grandparents is a wild card , experts say . " It 's kind of interesting to speculate " whether they will identify in some manner with the grandparents in this case , Levinson says . " Every now and then , justices emerge between the lines when they are deciding things that could affect them personally . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the term and has prompted friend-of-the-court briefs from many organizations and more than a dozen states . <p> All 50 states have some kind of grandparent-visitation law on the books . In some states , courts can order visits for grandparents only if parents are deceased , divorced or unmarried . Some state laws require proof of a close relationship between children and grandparents before visits can be ordered . Still others insist that courts consider the effect of such visits on parent-child relationships . <p> All states require that judges must determine , before they permit visits between children and their grandparents , whether such visits are in the " best interests of the child . " <p> The 1973 Washington law at issue had the broadest visitation provisions in the nation , says Columbia University family-law expert Carol Sanger , and went far beyond grandparent visits . It allowed courts to order child-visits with " any person , " even a non-relative . <p> After the Troxels filed their lawsuit , the Washington Legislature changed the law to spell out the factors a judge could consider in deciding on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the child . <p> But the justices will have before them the law as it was when the lawsuit was filed . Sanger says the statute was so broad that some people are concerned that gay parents , deeply religious parents , single mothers or even poor parents might have to contend with unwanted , court-ordered visits from third parties . <p> On the other hand , she points out , supporters of " third-party visitation " fear the Supreme Court will go too far in blocking well-thought-out , court-approved visits not just with grandparents but with former stepparents and others , such as the ex-partners of gay parents , who may have strong ties to a child even if they no longer live in the same household . <p> The American Association of Retired Persons and the National Conference of State Legislatures are among those weighing in for the grandparents . Advocates for the parents range from the American Civil Liberties Union to the National Association of Evangelicals . <p> The case could be tough for judges on the court who might favor parents ' rights in this case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of federal constitutional law that guarantees such rights , Levinson says . <p> ' Not an easy call ' <p> " It 's not an easy , conservative versus liberal call , " Harvard law professor Elizabeth Bartholet says . " The court may be taking up the case just to consider the area of grandparents ' rights since there have been growing numbers of laws and court decisions allowing grandparent intervention . Or it may be considering something broader . " <p> Tribe , also of Harvard , declined to speculate on how the court would rule , suggesting that the justices may eventually " fail to resolve this case and punt . " They could , for example , set out some broad principles and then return the case to the Washington courts to decide the specific dispute . <p> The court has dealt once before , but not in a custody case , with grandparents ' rights , Tribe notes . In 1977 , the Supreme Court struck down an East Cleveland , Ohio , housing ordinance that barred a grandmother from living in public housing with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Ours is by no means a tradition limited to respect for the bonds uniting the members of the nuclear family . The tradition of uncles , aunts , cousins and especially grandparents sharing a household . . . has roots equally venerable and equally deserving of constitutional recognition . " <p> Although the focus of the case is broader than the rights of the nation 's 60 million grandparents , they have surely fought hardest for these visitation laws . <p> Just last week , the AARP released results of a survey of 823 grandparents over age 50 taken last fall . It shows that 85% had talked to their grandchildren in the past month and 82% had seen them . About 11% are active caregivers , either rearing a grandchild ( 3% ) or providing day-care regularly ( 8% ) . <p> Of the grandparents who do n't live with their grandchildren or provide day care , 44% see them once a week . They said they spend a median $ 489 a year on their grandchildren , mostly for clothes and books . <p> " It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minor infringement on parental rights , " says AARP attorney Rochelle Bobroff . The Troxels " are not challenging the parents ' custody in any way . " <p> " The grandparents do n't get to pick their school , their religion . We are talking about visiting for a few hours , so it is our position that this is a minor infringement . It is not going to stop parents from raising their children . " <p> The case of Troxel vs . Granville has its roots here in Anacortes , where Brad Troxel and Tommie Granville began living together in 1989 . They never married , but together they had Natalie . Isabelle was on the way when they separated in 1991 . The mother , who had three children from a previous marriage , continued as primary caregiver for the children . Brad Troxel took the girls from time to time and often stayed with his parents . <p> After Brad committed suicide in 1993 , his parents reached out to Brad 's daughters and sought to spend more time with them . The girls ' mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treating the girls as a " substitute " for their son . She resisted their desire for overnight visits every other weekend and longer visits on holidays and birthdays , and finally limited their visits . <p> Unhappy with the result , the Troxels filed a lawsuit for child visitation shortly before Granville married Kelly Wynn , a local businessman with children of his own . He adopted the girls , and the couple now has eight children in all . " We definitely have a blended family , " says the mother , who goes by the name Tommie Wynn . " Mine , his and ours . " <p> Living 15 minutes away are the Troxels . Jenifer is assistant finance director of the city of Anacortes . Her husband , Gary , 60 , is a longshoreman and was the lead singer in the Fleetwoods , a late-1950s era trio .

" I think she 's doing just fine . " <p> And mother Wynn says , " We 've been willing to allow visitation throughout all of this . We just disagree on what kind . " <p> Both sides are already nervous about today 's arguments and the high court 's decision . " It affects every child in our house . It 's been a tremendous financial burden , " Tommie Wynn says . " It 's been very hard . " <p> When it 's all over , Jenifer Troxel says , " I just hope and pray that we can still see the grandchildren .
