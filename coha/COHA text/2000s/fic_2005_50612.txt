THERE ARE REASONS I was pitching horseshoes with my father on the last Wednesday in November . My mother was three years dead , and Dad was still nonplussed by the loose ends of his retirement , and my brother Ted , who had a wife and twin daughters and a brand new house across the Bay , had decided that this was the year his family needed to start establishing some traditions of their own . He tried to include us , of course , extended several invitations , but Dad could n't be persuaded to leave Mobile for Thanksgiving . I suggested that Ted bring the girls over for a visit the day before or the day after , whatever he wanted , but he felt provoked by our fathers obstinance and he , too , refused to bend . Telling it now , the whole business reeks of pettiness and folly , but like most family squabbles it seemed important at the time . <p> I watched Dad draw back , slowly , slowly , watched him let a horseshoe fly , watched the horseshoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a discouraged voice he said , " What are we playing to again ? " <p> It was early evening , unseasonably warm even for lower Alabama , light melting down through the branches of the trees . The ground was littered with fallen leaves , brown and brittle , all curled in upon themselves . I thought maybe I should rake tomorrow , wondered if he 'd raked at all this year . <p> " Eleven , " I said . <p> " I used to be good at this . " He rubbed his eyes , gazed over the chain link fence . There was a little yellow house back there , an old woman puttering on her back porch . " We 'll visit your mother in the morning , " Dad said , meaning her grave . <p> We walked the length of the pit , toeing the ground in search of wayward horseshoes . That 's how deep the leaves were piled . Down in the mulchy yellow grass , I spotted the ID tag from a pet collar . The lettering had weathered off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just shrugged . <p> " I need a drink , " he said . <p> And he trudged off toward the house without another word . I sat on the ground to wait for him , rubbed the ID tag between my fingers . You could hardly feel the traces of engraving there . Hardy the Lab , Mullet the mutt , Salmon P. Chase the cat . The long gone pets of my youth . It was hard to believe the tag could have belonged to any of them , could have remained undiscovered in the backyard all that time . My father drove those horseshoe stakes when I was nine years old . That was nearly a quarter century ago . <p> Behind me , I heard a woman calling , " Allo-o . " There was plenty of French accent in her voice . " Who is that I see ? " <p> I stood and faced the voice and saw the old woman closing fast from her side of the fence . <p> " You must be the son , " she said . " Ted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm the other one , " and I would have sworn she looked disappointed . She was my fathers age , maybe a little younger . It was hard to tell . She wore her hair in a silver blond pageboy , and her features were all pinched together in the middle of her face . <p> " Frank , " I said . <p> The woman extended her hand . Her fingers were limp and knotty in mine . <p> " Madame Langlois . I am your fathers neighbor . " She pointed behind her at the little yellow house . " You look like your father very much . " <p> " He 's inside , " I said . <p> Madame Langlois fmgered the collar of her turtleneck , a gesture made girlish by the tilt of her head and by the fact that her nails were painted prom dress pink . " Your father , he is a good man . " Her accent was like something from the movies , all bouncy pitch and rounded vowels , her s 's edged with z 's . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dedicate themselves to-how you say ? - public service . " She bobbed her head to underscore the words . <p> What she said was true . My father was a twelve-term city councilman , an important man in his way , dedicated , locally connected . There were photographs of him with Jimmy Carter , with Mike Dukakis , with Bill Clinton hanging in the room we had always called his " den . " The Clinton photo was taken in 1994 , the year Dad ran for Congress . The president was in town stumping for local Democrats . Likely his endorsement hurt more than it helped in this part of the world . <p> Mohawk Street is located in an older part of the city known simply and practically as Midtown-halfway between the bars and the business district and the shipyards down near where the river meets the Bay , and on the other side , the more upscale neighborhoods in west Mobile , the country club , the private schools , and so on . My father moved us there when I was six years old in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old southern liberal like my father , diversity meant black people ; he wanted to see his boys riding bikes and playing ball with a more colorful group than was handy in west Mobile . Much to his dismay , however , lots of well-intentioned white folk had the same idea , and the neighborhood began to gentrify around us almost as soon as we moved in : new paint glistening on the shotgun houses and Creole cottages , contractors banging away all day long , landscapers ' trucks parked along the curb-all of which had the effect of driving property values up and most of the black residents to the other , less pallid side of Government Boulevard . The house had tripled in value since Dad bought it , and Ted was always pushing him to sell-maybe buy a condo on the Bay , closer to him and Marcy and the girls-and sock the rest into a mutual fund or something , set him up big time in his retirement , but Dad refused . He claimed both inertia and nostalgia , but I think he was embarrassed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was waiting around for the neighborhood to go to pot again . <p> As if to expedite the process , he 'd let the old place fall into disrepair both inside and out . The toilets ran . The paint was chipped . The gutters sagged . The floors needed refmishing . The shutters were missing slats . This is not to mention nonstructural wreckage : the pile of New Yorkers in the foyer , the discarded undershirts and boxer shorts on the bathroom floor , the unwashed dishes in the sink , all of which seemed somehow to emanate , like fallout , from the den . <p> That 's where I tracked him down after parting ways with Madame Langlois . He was pretending to sleep in his recliner , but I could tell he was awake . His face was alert even though his eyes were closed . A single lamp was burning beside the chair , spotlighting him , accentuating shadows , making the scene look staged . He had the TV on , the news , the volume muted . <p> " Dad ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faked a yawn . " Did you say something ? I just turned this on to see the weather . I guess I dozed off . That 's what happens when you get old . " <p> I tossed yesterday 's Press Register on the floor to make room on the couch . The other cushions were cluttered with men 's dress socks , maybe three dozen , brown , black , blue , argyle , none of them balled into a pair . The room was a sort of quintessential den , with its wood paneling , its furniture banished from other , better rooms . It had a vaguely disgruntled and embarrassed air . Mom always kept her distance from the den , partly , I suppose , to allow Dad a sanctuary in the house , but also because it had reached , long before she died , an irreversible momentum toward decay . <p> " Your neighbor dropped by . " <p> I watched his face , his eyes . <p> " Which one ? " <p> He brought the recliner upright with a hand lever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a tumbler of scotch sweating on the end table . I was pretty sure the timing of his exit was deliberate . He knew exactly who I meant . <p> " The French one , " I said . <p> " Is she gone ? What did she want ? " <p> I sniffed a blue sock to see if it was clean . " I do n't know . Just to talk to you , I guess . To introduce herself to me . " I pushed my hand up in the sock and worked it like a puppet . " Sounds like you guys are pretty friendly . " <p> My father made a face . " That woman 's nuts , " he said . <p> We ordered pizza for dinner , and when there was nothing left but rinds of crust , I suggested a game of chess . We Poseys have always played games-horseshoes , chess , backgammon , poker , darts , croquet-to pass the time . We set up on the breakfast table . By the time the doorbell rang , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two more scotches and played me into a corner . It was just after nine o'clock . I padded through the darkened dining room , dodging furniture by memory , catching my knee on an umbrella stand . There was Madame Langlois on the stoop bearing some kind of Tupperware container . <p> " I brought you a cake , " she said . " It is nothing . I was baking . " <p> Without waiting for an invitation , Madame Langlois retraced my route through the dining room to the kitchen , but my father was gone when we arrived . She surveyed the room , took in the chess pieces still poised , the pizza box on the counter . I could hear the shower running in the upstairs bathroom , the rattle and wheeze of old plumbing . His timing struck me as suspicious . Madame Langlois turned on her heel . <p> " It is poppy seed and lemon , " she said . <p> I thanked her , told her that she should n't have , but Madame Langlois waved my gratitude away . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly anything in there-I 'd already decided to go shopping in the morning-but Madame Langlois hesitated with her cake as if searching for space . She made a pensive , puckery sound , then faced me again , the cake at her shoulder , like a waitress . <p> " Listen to me , " she said . " I can see that you are helpless . You must let me cook for you tomorrow night . " <p> " I thought I 'd take Dad out . " <p> " Non " said Madame Langlois . " The holiday , it is about the home . The turkey and the Pilgrims and the giving thanks . " <p> I almost laughed . " That 's too much trouble . " <p> " I insist , " she said . " It is final . No more talking . My family is , how you say- " She fluttered her hand . I had no idea what expression she was looking for , so she finished the thought herself . " I am alone . I have no plans . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I liked this woman , her over-cooked accent , her aggressive loneliness , and I wanted , just then , to make her happy . Plus , I 'm sure part of me was worried about being alone with Dad , worried we 'd both be miserable . The whole thing was purely selfish . Though I could sense repercussions looming , I shunted all thoughts of the future aside and focused on the look on Madame Langlois 's face when I accepted her invitation . I walked her out , feeling pleased with myself , then headed upstairs to check in with Dad . <p> " I 'm in the shower , " he shouted . " What do you want ? " <p> I tried the knob , unlocked . I poked my head in so we could hear each other better . He was perched on the toilet fully dressed . A look of panic washed over his face , then anger , then resignation . Finally , his features settled into sheepish . I 'd never seen him look sheepish in his life . <p> " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " Nothings going on . " <p> I told him about Madame Langlois 's visit , about the plans we 'd made , and my father pushed abruptly to his feet . " No . No . I will not have my Thanksgiving with that woman . " <p> He dropped his shoulder , brushed past me out the door . I followed him to his room down the hall . To my surprise , the room was immaculate , a perfect contrast to the rest of the house , the bed neatly made , no clothes scattered on the floor . Even his loose change was stacked in little piles atop the dresser-pennies , nickels , dimes , quarters . My mother was always on him about picking up after himself . <p> " C'm on , Dad , " I said . " She 's nice . She 's all alone . " <p> " She 's a nuisance , " my father said . <p> On what used to be my mother 's nightstand , I noticed a long wig , the color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The last one she bought , I thought . Seeing it there like that made my joints all watery . She 'd bought lots of wigs during her run of chemo . I reassured myself with the notion that at least this was the only one he 'd kept . <p> I told him , " It 's too late to cancel , " but there was no resolve left in my voice . <p> " It 's not . Go over there right this minute . It 's not too late . Tell her anything you want . " <p> " I ca n't . " <p> " Please . " <p> His eyes were round , bloodshot , his hair mussed like he 'd been asleep . My father had gone gray years ago , and he had these wild white eyebrows . My mother used to say his eyebrows put her in mind of a demented genius , but just then he resembled nothing so much as a tired old man . I did n't see how I could refuse him . <p> Madame Langlois answered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peacock feathers on the lapel . She smiled , blinked , clutched her robe across her chest , which was mottled with liver spots , and right away I knew I could n't go through with breaking the date . My father would be furious , but I 'd figure something out . The question now was what to tell her about why I 'd come . <p> " Bonsoir , " she said . " Come in , come in . You will excuse my appearance , s'il vous plat . I was n't expecting anyone . " <p> I followed her to the living room and she waved me into a chair , offered me tea ? brandy ? a little wine ? I said no thanks . Madame Langlois settled herself on a chaise longue . The room was spare but tasteful , everything antique , old books in the built-in shelves . The whole house smelled of cooking . Not just baking but the savory aroma of meat warming in the oven . Was it possible she 'd already started preparing for tomorrow ? <p> " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oui . " She pointed at a bird cage draped with a pale blue sheet , drew her knees up . Her shins were practically translucent . " My parakeet , Abigail . She is asleep . " <p> " It 's just that I found an ID tag , you know , like for a dog collar . I thought maybe you might have lost it , your pet I mean . " <p> " Abigail does not wear a collar . " <p> " Right . " I felt a blush coming on . " It would only apply if you had a dog or cat . Maybe you know if one of the neighbors is missing a pet or something- " <p> " This is why you 've come ? " <p> I cleared my throat . <p> " Well . " <p> Madame Langlois reached over to pat my knee . <p> " Tell me about yourself ? ' she said . " I know about your brother . The lawyer . " She accented the second syllable instead of the first , making Ted 's profession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandchildren . Twins , yes ? But I know only that you exist . " <p> " He talks about Ted ? " <p> " Your father is very proud . " <p> I turned thirty-three years old that year . I was single and without prospects . When people asked me what I did for a living , I told them I was a member of Shakespeare Express , this theater group that traveled around to high schools all over the South doing half-hour versions of Hamlet or Romeo and Juliet or a sort of greatest hits compilation , the big , dramatic moments from the most popular plays , anything we could cram into the time allotted for a school assembly . I hated it , but how else was I supposed to pay the bills ? I also performed at The Playhouse over on Spring Hill Avenue . That summer just past I 'd done Vince in Buried Child , which sounded , at least to me , more legitimate than Shakespeare Express but paid less well than delivering pizzas . Now and then I had a date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was working on . Sometimes we had sex . I mention this only because , given the specifics of my life , people often assumed that I was gay . The rest of the story is that I had tried New York after college and failed , and when I came home I thought I 'd figure out some other way to make a living . I never did . Here 's the point : I understood why , despite the holiday dustup , my father would be more likely to discuss Ted 's life than mine , but still it took the wind out of me out a little . <p> This time , he really was dozing in his recliner when I got home , the TV blaring CNN , his mouth hanging open , his chin slick with drool . His face looked thin and pale . There was a half-empty scotch between his legs , his right hand capped over the glass , as if to keep foreign objects out while he was asleep . I worried that he was drinking too much and thought maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had always liked a drink and it was a holiday besides-certainly not the time . So I woke him up and waited for him to get oriented . He would n't let me help him up to bed . <p> I 'd planned to go on home and come back in the morning , but I made up my mind then and there to spend the night . It seemed like the right thing . And my place was n't much of a home . I was on the road enough that it did n't make sense to spend a lot on rent , so I kept a little efficiency here in town . It sounded nice to sleep in my old room . The posters and pennants on the walls , all left over from my boyhood . The twin beds . There was still a working phone on the nightstand . I was n't ready to pack it in , so I called Ted . <p> " It 's late , " he said , after I 'd identified myself . " We 've got kids here , pal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I just wanted to check in . " <p> " How 's Dad ? " <p> " He 's all right , " I told him . " A little down , you know , but all right . Do n't forget to call tomorrow . " <p> In my pocket , I found the ID tag . I 'd forgotten it was there . <p> " I 'm not an idiot , " he said . <p> " It 's just that you sounded pissed last week . " <p> " To be honest , I was pissed . I am pissed . I think I have a right to be pissed that my father does n't want to visit his granddaughters on Thanksgiving . We 've come to him every holiday since the girls were born . I miss Mom , too , but I have a family to think about . It 's been three years . " Ted paused , took a breath . " And you 're not doing anybody any good humoring him . He 's a grown man , Frank . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ID tag between my teeth . How familiar all this was , the spongy mattress , the window leaking a draft over my feet , my brother 's voice on the phone , my father snoring down the hall . Ted and I had shared that room until he went away to the University of Alabama . I 'd gotten in the habit back then of calling him after everyone else had gone to bed , listening to his adventures , fraternity stuff and stuff with girls , nothing major , but it all seemed foreign and magical at the time . <p> " I guess . " <p> Ted said , " It 's true . " <p> " He 's got this neighbor , this crazy French lady . " <p> There passed a stretch of silence on the line . <p> " I fail to see the relevance , " Ted said . <p> In the morning , as promised , we visited my mother 's grave . It was cooler than the day before , cold enough to mist our breath , a suggestion that winter might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't say a word about my sleeping over . For a long time we stood there without speaking . I tried to think about Mom , tried to pray , but I did n't know what to ask of God . She was or was not in heaven by now , and I had all these mixed feelings about religion to begin with . I tried , after a while , to empty my mind , to pay homage to my mother with silent meditation , but life kept creeping in . I could n't quit thinking about Ted , wondering if he was sorry that he was n't coming for Thanksgiving , and I was worried about what to tell Dad about Madame Langlois . <p> My mother was originally from Baton Rouge , a big , Cajun-looking woman , dark hair , dark eyes , broad shoulders , just over six feet tall , though she disliked her size and lied about it on her drivers license . She moved to Mobile to take a job at the Planned Parenthood Center here . The work was trying and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable . She was managing the center inside two years . That 's how she met my father . He was still practicing law back then and had agreed to do some pro bono stuff for Planned Parenthood . Decades later , when the cancer forced her out of work , Mom said to me , " The good news is I 've seen the last of all those stupid , careless girls . " I 'm still not sure if she was kidding . There was real bitterness in her voice . At the time , I believed she was angry at her illness , not her job , but I do n't know . That kind of work , there 's never any end in sight . It can t help but wear a person down . In old pictures , the first thing you notice is my mother 's carriage , how proud-looking she was , how erect , even with two young sons hanging on her like chimpanzees . But her height worked against her over time , and even before she got sick , she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Back on the road , headed home , I asked Dad , apropos of nothing , why he had n't taken another crack at national office . It 's not like he lost in a landslide . His opponent nipped him by 4 percent . <p> " Well , " he said . Then he went quiet a moment , gathered his thoughts . He kept his eyes on the windshield . " You have to remember , I 'd already been on the city council a long time , so I 'd made plenty of enemies . Even in the party . Plus , this district is pretty conservative , you know that . They wanted a moderate to run against the Nazis that pass for Republicans in this part of the state . Plus , I 'm sixtysix years old . " He switched on the radio , spun the dial , turned it off . " Plus , your mother-she was pretty disappointed . " <p> When they got married , Dad had just hung out his shingle , and he was taking a lot of court-appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was Mom 's idea for him to run for city council , not to win necessarily , but to get his name out there , to give him a forum , which might drum up better-paying business . But he did win , to their surprise , and it turned out he liked having a say in how his city worked . I wondered if Congress was n't her idea as well . <p> We drove awhile in silence , past a church , a pawn shop , a Burger King . Then it was my father s turn for a non sequitur . <p> " Your brother is a lucky man , " he said . <p> " How 's that ? " <p> " He 's making money hand over fist and he 's got Marcy . I hope he knows how lucky he is . " <p> I thought about my brothers wife , how pretty she was , how unflappable with Ted and the girls . And I thought about the twins , each a lovely and perfect replica of the other . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made partner not ten months before , how he was always telling me , without actually saying the words aloud , that it was high time for me to get serious about my life . <p> I said , " You had Mom . " <p> " Your mother , who lived her whole life right , died at sixty . That 's not luck . " <p> I could imagine several replies , all of them having to do with how fortunate my father was to have found someone to love at all , but it did n't make sense to argue . I considered broaching the subject of Madame Langlois , but before I could speak , my father bolted forward in his seat . <p> " Turn here , " he said . " Here . Quick . " <p> I followed his directions through a four-way stop . <p> " Where are we going ? " <p> " I want to show you something . I was visiting your mother not too long ago and got turned around on the way home , so I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He was sitting on the edge of his seat , hands on the dashboard , eyes scanning out the window . " There , " he said . " Take this right . " He directed me to a nondescript brick rancher , told me to pull over at the curb . He was out of the car and on the lawn before I had time to kill the engine . It took a moment to realize what he wanted me to see : a small house in the grass , plantation style , maybe four feet tall , a miniature Cadillac parked out front . <p> When I opened my door , I heard Elvis doing " Spanish Harlem . " <p> " It 's Graceland , " my father said . <p> " It 's what ? " <p> " Look in the windows . It 's an exact replica . The jungle room . And the bathroom where he died . It 's Graceland down to the last detail . " <p> I walked over and peeked inside . There was an Elvis doll in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet propped up like he was winding down after a show . <p> " You 're kidding me , " I said . <p> " It 's up year-round . They pipe music in and everything . " Dad pointed at a speaker on a corner of the rancher . " Twenty-four hours a day , though I understand they turn the volume down at night . The neighbors just got used to it , I guess . I talked to the owners last time I was here . The wife grew up in Memphis . Nice people . Love Elvis , of course . They voted for me many times . " <p> " I have no idea what to think about this . " <p> " Is n't it perfect ? " my father said . <p> Elvis sounded deep and sad as ever , just about right for that late November morn . <p> While he napped , I raked and bagged leaves and contemplated my father in his retirement . Dad made up his mind to call it quits in 1998 , near the end of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleagues , his secretary , his sons most of all . He was still a young man , relatively speaking , and he had nothing particular in mind for the rest of his life . He refused to give anybody a reason . When we asked , he 'd go on about how he was fully vested in his pension plan and we did n't have anything to worry about . At first he took some pro bono cases and advised other lawyers now and then in their dealings with the city , and I was happy for him . It looked like he was getting back to where he started in the world . That was something I could understand . At some point , however , he quit working altogether-it took Ted and me a while to arrive at this conclusion-and what I could n't figure was how he filled his days . He had no hobbies to speak of . Most of his friends were still employed , so he was n't hanging out with them . I did n't want to ask him what he did with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I was concerned . I had an image of him lounging in his recliner , drinking scotch in the middle of the day , and watching the world go by on CNN . <p> When I finished the leaves , I headed for Winn Dixie and loaded up on basics : soup and cereal , bread and fruit , coffee and milk . That 's all Dad ever bothered with by himself and pretty much all I could afford besides . <p> I stopped off at my place to pick up a change of clothes . The thermostat was off and it was cold . It felt like nobody had been in there for a long time . <p> Dad started in on me as soon as I got home . <p> " What the hell ? " he said . " I do n't believe you . I ca n't believe you lied . " I mean his eyes were bulging , hands chopping the air . He caught me so off guard that it took a minute to get my head around what had happened . Turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to propose a change of plans : she was still cooking but she wanted to eat at our house instead of hers . <p> " Goddamnit , Frank . " He followed me out to my Subaru while I retrieved another load of groceries . " You promised . I sounded like a fool . " <p> " Look , I 'm sorry . You should have seen her . All alone in this robe . It had feathers on it , Dad . I could n't do it . " <p> He stared . Nothing can make you feel more like somebody 's kid than that look of disappointment . He stomped back up to the house and I started lugging the groceries in myself , thinking I was supposed to be there to spend time with my father , not humor Madame Langlois , thinking no way did a thing like this happen on my brother s watch . That 's when the bottom of one of the bags gave way and three cantaloupes went bowling down the driveway . I managed to catch up to the first one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gutter , while the third raced toward Mohawk , where it was exploded beneath the tires of a passing SUV . <p> Four o'clock found me cleaning house . Td always thought there was something sad about that hour , that season . It had to do with early nightfall and the encroachment of another year . Dad was holed up in his room with the door locked . I did the best I could , but the vacuum cleaner did n't work and I could n't find a dustpan and the house was pretty far gone besides . Mostly I wound up hiding the mess in closets and under furniture or trying to organize it-what else to do with all those back issues of The New Yorker ? - into a neater semblance of itself . Madame Langlois was due at 5:30 , and it was way too late to put her off . <p> I thought about calling Ted . He 'd never have admitted it , but I knew it would make him happy to hear that Thanksgiving had gone to hell without him , and I was pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I was embarrassed and I did n't want to give him the pleasure . He was probably sitting down right that minute to a beautifully set table with his beautiful wife and his beautiful little girls , all of them done up like something from a Brooks Brothers catalog . Or maybe they 'd already finished the meal , and the house had settled into nap time , a fire burning toward embers in the hearth , a football game on TV with the volume turned down low . It was cheesy , sure , but it was so bewitching in my imagination that I was jealous of Ted and irritated with Dad for his unwillingness to compromise . <p> Eventually I gave up on the house-it was as neat as it would get-and trudged upstairs , knocked on my fathers door . No answer , but I could hear NPR ticking off the headlines on his clock radio . <p> " Dad ? " <p> Nothing . <p> " Do you think Ted voted for Bush ? " I said . <p> I knew the answer and so did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election and I hoped politics would provoke a response . Ted 's politics in particular . I pressed my ear to the door . Somehow , the faint droning of the radio made the silence more pronounced . <p> I said , " I know Marcy has a sticker on her Suburban , " but Dad held out . <p> Back downstairs , I hunted up matching place mats , set the table for three just in case . I found some candles in the pantry . By the time I was finished , it was 5:15 . Still no sign of Dad . I decided to tell Madame Langlois he was n't feeling well . It 'd be just the two of us tonight . To steel myself , I poured a great big scotch and sat at the table , took a minute to catch my breath . I was wondering if there was more to my father 's desire to avoid Madame Langlois than personal distaste-he seemed almost afraid of her-when Dad himself appeared in the doorway , wearing a blazer and tie . His hair was wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of those , " he said , aiming a finger at my drink . <p> Madame Langlois was right on time . It took the three of us two trips to haul all that food in from her car . Turkey on a silver platter . Sweet potatoes . Stuffing . Bread . Some kind offish and mushroom casserole in a Pyrex dish . Salad in a huge plastic bowl . She made both a cake and a pumpkin pie . She insisted that Dad and I take our places at the table while she did the final preparations . <p> From the kitchen , Madame Langlois said , " I hope you do not mind . The casserole , it is French . I know this is your holiday , but I love to see my American friends enjoy French food . " <p> She said eet instead of if . Her accent seemed somehow even thicker than before . <p> I waited a second , gave my father a chance to reply . He did n't bother . Before I could speak , Madame Langlois was running on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the kitchen . It gives me such a pleasure to cook for men with their appetites . " <p> Zee , she said . Geeves . <p> I cut a look at my father , tried , with an eyebrow thing and a complicated smile , to let him know that I was in on the joke-sure , she was ridiculous-but also gratified that he and I had been able to make her happy in this small way . He looked away , sipped at the Sauvignon blanc shed poured . He screwed his face up at the taste and went back to scotch instead . <p> " Your mother , " he said , " she used to drink merlot with everything . Red meat , white meat . It did n't matter . She knew what she liked . She 'd put a single ice cube in the glass . She preferred it just a little chilled and watered down . " <p> An egg timer dinged and I heard a tiny continental-sounding exclamation from Madame Langlois . <p> Dad went on . " She never liked a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'd do beef tenderloin instead . She was n't much of a cook , but it always turned out nice . " <p> He was talking like Mom had been gone for decades , like he was worried I 'd forgotten her . His voice was way too loud . <p> There was some banging and rustling in the kitchen . A minute later Madame Langlois swung into the room bearing the turkey platter , which she placed on a trivet beside my father . She lifted the lid with a flourish . It was a beautiful bird . <p> " You will carve for us , Jeff , no ? " <p> My father grunted his assent , and Madame Langlois shuttled in a few more platters then took her seat across from me . She looked a little wilted . We watched Dad hack at the turkey . <p> " So , " she said . " Tell me , Frank . You have been to France ? " <p> I bobbed my head . " After college . I did the backpack thing . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let 's see . Paris for about a week , " I said , " then the south , Nice and Antibes . Maybe two weeks altogether . " <p> Madame Langlois served herself some casserole , started the dish on its round . " You did not visit the Loire Valley ? " <p> " Afraid not . " <p> I took some , passed the casserole to my father , and waited for Madame Langlois to finish with the salad . She made a little sucking sound with her tongue . " Then you did not see France . The Loire Valley is the very-how you say ? - the very soul of the country . My grandfather and his father before him and on and on like so , they had a vineyard near Lyon . " <p> Right then , my father slapped the serving spoon into the casserole dish , hard enough to splatter his tie and one lens of his glasses . Madame Langlois and I both startled in our chairs . <p> " That 's it ! " he said . " I cant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't seem to notice the dollop of cream sauce obscuring his left eye . " This woman , " he said , bolting to his feet and aiming a finger like a TV lawyer , " she 's from North goddamn Carolina . Her father may have run a vineyard , but what he made was third-rate domestic cabernet . " Madame Langlois 's lips were pressed into a thin white line . My father addressed her directly . " You 've been in this country almost fifty years . " His voice leapt up in volume at the end of the sentence . " It 's absurd . You 're more American than Frank . " <p> I was n't sure what he meant by that . He turned , too quickly , tipping his chair back on its hind legs , and stormed off from the table . The chair wobbled a moment , righted itself . Because it was too awkward and confusing to meet one another 's eyes , Madame Langlois and I stared at the space my father had vacated , as if he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped Madame Langlois pack all that food into Dad 's refrigerator-she insisted , said she 'd made it for us , said it was too much for her-she told me two stories . <p> The first confirmed a fair amount of my father 's accusation while casting the details in a different light . It turned out that the Langlois family vineyard went bellyup when she was in her teens , and her father was forced to take a job overseeing production at a fledgling winery in the States , the pet project of a poet who 'd married an heiress and had the advantage of her money . Her father would n't let his children ( Madame Langlois was the youngest of three ) speak English in the house , which explained , she said , the fact that she still had an accent after all this time . She 'd come to Mobile to take a job teaching languages at the Jesuit college here in town . <p> I was beginning to wonder how my father had arrived at his knowledge of her past , when she launched , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cajoling , he 'd accepted an invitation to dinner at her house . This was just before Halloween . Madame Langlois spared me no detail . The wine , the music , the candlelight . The food-smoked salmon souffl , followed by fruit terrine . They talked : she about her father , he , after a while , about my brother . Madame Langlois was just setting a cup of coffee at his place when he took her face in both his hands and kissed her on the mouth . <p> " It was a perfect little kiss , " she said . <p> Except that it caused her to forget herself so completely that she spilled the coffee in my father 's lap . Except that once he recovered from the coffee , he was embarrassed by the kiss , and neither of them knew how to find their way back to intimacy . Dad had been vague and distant with her since . <p> When the food was put away , I walked her to her car and she rolled down the window . <p> " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sorry . " <p> " But how could you have known ? " <p> I could n't help listening for traces of North Carolina in her voice . I put on an apologetic face . <p> " I ruined your Thanksgiving . " <p> She shrugged . " It is not my holiday , " she said . <p> Inside , the phone was ringing and I snatched it up in the kitchen half a beat after my father answered upstairs . <p> I heard him say , " Jeff Posey , " like he was at the office . <p> " Hey , Dad . " <p> " Son , " my father said , his voice thick with pleasure . Son-like Ted was an only child . <p> I was just about to hang up when Ted said , " Y'all eat yet ? " <p> I hesitated . I wanted to know how Dad would answer , but he dodged the question like a pro . <p> " I bet Marcy really laid it on . " <p> " I 'm still stuffed , " Ted said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I worried that if I hung up , they 'd hear it , they 'd find me out . Plus , I was curious . In the weeks leading up to Thanksgiving , I 'd been acting as a go-between , getting accounts from each of them about what the other said . I had n't seen or heard them together . To listen now , you would have thought nothing was wrong . My ear felt hot under the phone , but I stayed put . The two of them were maybe the most interesting thing in my life . <p> Dad said , " The girls OK ? " <p> " You bet , " Ted said . " You 'll see . " <p> " Maybe you 'll come at Christmas . " <p> Ted was quiet . Then he said , " Marcy 's calling , Dad . I got to run . " <p> People always described my mother as a " no-nonsense " woman , and it was true . She never babied me or Ted or treated her clients at Planned Parenthood with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody 's feelings . She disliked public displays of affection . She disdained extravagance in almost any form . It was n't that she was cold . I always knew she loved me , and so , I 'm sure , did Ted ; and the girls down at the center seemed to appreciate that she was n't full of shit . During Dad 's run for the House , Mom told a reporter for the Press Register that she was almost certain her husband would lose . The piece was supposed to be a profile of the candidates ' wives , something for the " Living " section , interior design photos and tender memories about the candidates . When the reporter asked why Mom did n't like Dad 's chances , she said , " Look , my husband has actually been doing his job all these years instead of cultivating influence with the business bigshots and religious phonies , and it 's been my experience that people like him hardly ever win elections anymore . " Dad loved it , worked it into his campaign , though Ted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the editor ( he was not altogether without influence , no matter what Mom said ) to have the paper strike the next line of her quote which read something like , " This is not to mention that most people around here think of me as a kind of back-alley abortionist . " <p> What I 'm saying is , I 'm sure she would have wanted her husband to find comfort wherever he could when she was gone , even with someone as frivolous as Madame Langlois . But Dad did n't see it like that . <p> I was in the kitchen making a turkey sandwich when he finally came downstairs . He sat at the breakfast table , and without asking I prepared the sandwich the way he liked-salt and pepper , a little mayo , nothing fancy-and fixed him a scotch . I knew I should n't have , but I did . He tucked in without a word , and I set about making a second sandwich for myself . <p> " Everything all right ? " <p> " Your brother called , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded , chewed . <p> " Tell me something , " he said after a while . " Be honest now . What did you think about that miniature Graceland ? You thought it was silly . " He did a bashful grin . " Tell the truth . " <p> " OK , sure . It was silly . " <p> He shook his head . I carried my sandwich to the table , took my seat . Both of us had gotten more comfortable . I was in yesterdays jeans and a fleece pullover , and Dad had put a robe on over his trousers and his undershirt . <p> " I do n't want to stop loving your mother , " he said . <p> That made me flinch . Dad took a bite , dropped his eyes . I tried to imagine what sort of feeling swept through Dad when he reached for Madame Langlois 's face , touched his lips to hers ; how his heart must have raced , how all the loneliness in the world must have been welling up inside him . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and Madame Langlois , and I had no idea how to respond ; but he was n't after my opinion anyway . <p> " Ill fix it with Louise , " he said . <p> " Who ? " <p> " Madame Langlois . " <p> " Oh , " I said . <p> Somewhere , not too far off , a dog was barking . We listened for a second , then it stopped and a silence settled over us , neither awkward nor profound . <p> My father was the first to speak . <p> " Do n't tell your brother about all this . " <p> " Right , " I said . " No problem . " <p> When we finished eating , Dad freshened his drink and we adjourned to the den and watched three hours of a Star Trek marathon on TV . Halfway through the second episode , about a shape-shifting alien trying to commandeer the Enterprise by impersonating Captain Kirk , I looked over and saw that he 'd been crying . Halfway through the third , I heard him snoring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around in the pocket of my jeans and found that pet ID tag from yesterday . It gave me an idea . I waited until the commercial then crept out the front door and around the block to Madame Langlois 's , slipped the tag into her mailbox . By way of apology . She 'd know who left it there . <p> Elsewhere , my brother was bedded down beside his lovely wife , his girls dreaming sweet dreams down the hall . Elsewhere , my mother knew all the secrets of the universe or nothing . Elsewhere , even at that late hour , Elvis was crooning to a tiny simulacrum of his life . <p> I found Dad right where I left him , an afghan over his legs , his glasses reflecting blue light from the TV . <p> This time , he let me help him up to bed . <p> Author Affiliation
