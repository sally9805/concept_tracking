Last week my head was too small . This week , it is too big . My face in the mirror is a picture of dismay , if I try to correct the disproportion with baggy clothes , I will look not only moonheaded but squat , Charlie Brown  --  esque . When the head is too small , ! fare no better : tight clothes serve to distract the viewer 's eye downward , but to a double-A chest . <p> There is only one thing to do , and that is not to go to Erling 's house . It is to stay home with my enormous head and wait for it to correct itself . I lie down on the bed and rest my hand on the alarm clock . I stroke its smooth face with my thumb . I find comfort in objects  --  they are unchanging and useful . In the laundry room down the hall , I hear the telephone ring and ring . <p> It stops , and I hear my mother say , Yes . Just a minute . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? My mother knocks on the door , but is already pushing it open . She says , Sigrid 's on the phone for you . <p> I moan sleepily . <p> Oh , she says , and then says into the telephone , I think she 's napping , Siggi . Pause . Okay , then . I 'll tell her to call . <p> She turns off the phone but does n't leave . I can feel her standing there . I open one eye and say , What ? <p> What 's the matter , hon ? She picks up the small wooden box with all my baby teeth in it from the top of the dresser and fiddles with the lid . <p> Nothing , I say . I was sleeping . Put that down . <p> No you were n't , she says . What 's wrong ? Are n't you getting along with Sigrid ? <p> No , it 's fine , I say . I just did n't feel like talking yet . I sit up on my elbows and put on a smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head again . They are blinded by parental love , or parental vanity , and refuse to see it . <p> I am that most unfortunate of creatures , the homely child of attractive parents . My parents are a perfectly coordinated set , one fair and one dark , one petite and one grande . They have proportionate bodies and oval faces with regular features . My younger brother is the mirror image of my father , and all of them photograph well . I , on the other hand , have thin , flat , white-blond hair and grayish eyes with yellow flecks , and not a single facial feature is correct . Without going into minutiae , the basics are : my chin is too sharp , my jaw is too soft , the angle of my nose is too acute , my nostrils are too oblong , my eyelashes are too sparse , one eye closes more than the other when I laugh , my skin is so thin the veins show through , and it burns easily , and my smile is asymmetrical , the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth for a school play . I have since quit the theater . <p> Secretly I think that my imperfections are not accidents or coincidences . They are manifestations . As a child I was more or less symmetrical and pleasant-looking with only the traces of what was to come ; then as I got older , hit puberty , my flaws started to surface and move into my face and body . By the time I am an adult they may be uncorrectable . They are not always definable , but I have figured out what distorts my head . Worry . <p> I worry about losing things . I worry about throwing things away . I worry about forgetting things . I worry about the abandonment of useful things . I worry so much my head swells just to accommodate it all , and then shrinks to squeeze it out . The swelling is a wild uncontrollable twitch , worry growing and growing . The shrinking induces crushing headaches and a sense of dread , the inevitability of unnamed worries to come . <p> And I worry about my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The few times I have tried to explain the head condition  --  first to my mother and then to my father and then to Sigrid  --  they each scoffed and told me that I was crazy to think it . Either my head was at an in-between phase or they were trying to reassure me . I know every inch of my body , and I know when something is wrong . <p> I do n't even call Sigrid back , but she walks into my room at four o'clock , car keys in hand . Her thick brown hair is pulled back in a ponytail , and she 's wearing an old denim jacket the same color as her eyes . I am still lying on my back on the bed . <p> Hey , Onion , she says . You ready to go ? She frowns theatrically and says in a German accent , You do not look rheady to go . <p> I put a pillow over my face . I do n't feel up to it , I say . <p> Aw , you ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You stayed home all last week . What 's going on with you ? <p> I do n't know , I say . I pull the pillow down below my eyes . I do n't feel right . I do n't know what to wear . <p> Come on , baby , she says . Get up and get over here . Let 's find you something . <p> I trudge over to the closet and stand behind her in my T-shirt and underwear , massive head bobbing on my shoulders . She pulls open the door and draws her head back . <p> How is this arranged ? Color-coded ? <p> I did it yesterday , I say . It 's much easier like that . <p> How did you have it before ? <p> Organized by number of pockets . <p> You are not for real , she says . <p> Where did you get that ? You say it to everyone now . <p> Shut up , she says and hits my arm . She holds up my new Beavers Hockey 1990-91 sweatshirt . Here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Sigrid hauls me out to her mother 's old wood-paneled station wagon , the same cat that drove us to kindergarten together . We roll down the gravel driveway and onto the road . <p> Need soundtrack , Sigrid says . She never calls it music . She digs through the clacking tape cases and pushes in a cassette that crackles and pops like the vinyl it was recorded from . The soundtrack is a thudding drumbeat and snarling guitars as we drive through town , where half the stores arc still closed for the winter , and then over the dirt roads that cut through fields and woods . Spring is brief " and uneasy here . Finally the snow seems to have left for good , and all that 's left are small cold puddles in the ruts . The world looks exposed and a little awkward , like when my father shaved off his beard . His chin and jaw looked weak and naked . I felt embarrassed when I looked at him . <p> We come to fields of short , conical evergreens , evenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounded by untamed trees , dark bristly pines shot through with silver birches . This is the Christmas tree farm where Erling lives . <p> We pull into the driveway in front of the house , a stern gray split-level . Five or six cars are parked at the edge of the lawn . In the open garage , tour guys are playing pool . <p> Fuck , I say . There are so many people here . <p> Not that many , Sigrid says . You 're in quite a mood . <p> Sorry . It 's hard for me to be social in this state . <p> She pats my head , and I flinch . You 'll be fine , she says . She turns off the car , and the music stops . <p> We get out of the car and hear Guns N ' Roses , tinny and distant , from the pool game in the garage . An adolescent chocolate Lab bounds up to us , wriggling and jumping . Sigrid coos , Hello , Bailey ! and we try to pet him and kiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the house carrying a case of Mountain Dew . Bailey , get down ! he calls to the dog . Hey , guys , he says to us . We wave . He stops and waits for us to reach him . His hair is the same caramel brown as the freckles that blanket his cheeks and nose . <p> Sigrid pulls back his open flannel shirt to look at the T-shirt underneath . I ca n't believe you 're wearing that , she says . <p> Erling looks down at his chest . The T-shirt is crisp white , with a tank and an eagle and a Scud missile and an unfurling starred-and-striped banner that says OPERATION DESERT STORM . <p> This shirt kicks ass , he says . They 're on sale at Pamida now . Only five bucks . <p> Sigrid pulls the flannel shut but holds on for a second , fists resting on his chest . You are not even for real , she says with a grin and releases him . <p> Is the fire going yet ? I say . <p> Gorbachev @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check it out . The three of us walk around to the back of the house . <p> On the wide bare lawn behind the house , back by the edge of the tree fields , is the bonfire spot . It looks like a bomb hit the lawn , leaving a six-foot circle of ash and unidentifiable charred chunks . It is fed like an insatiable pet every weekend . Three old couches border it , stained and worn , one of them pocked with bullet holes . <p> Gorbachev , whose name is really Steve , turns off the chainsaw when he sees us . He is lanky with dark hair that curls over his collar in the back . When he gets nervous or embarrassed , a key-shaped purple stain creeps out from his hairline by his temple and spreads . In front of him is a dried-out balsam fir hacked into foot-long sections . <p> How 's it comin ' , Gorb ? says Erling . He stands next to him and looks down at the dismembered tree . <p> Gorbachev wipes his forehead . Pretty good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree , y'know . After New Year 's , he and Erling drive around town in Gorbachev 's pickup and load it up with discarded Christmas trees , which they pile behind the shed and chop up one by one every weekend for the fire . Even in the icy depths of January the blaze is high and hot enough to stand around it , one side of your body freezing while the other side roasts . <p> Erling nods and says , Yeah . We 'll figure something out . <p> Gorbachev looks at us and says , Hey . He looks at me for a second longer and smiles weirdly . Hey , Anya . <p> I smile back warily . Is he mocking me ? Hi , I say . I take Sigrid 's arm . We 're going to go inside for a minute . <p> I pull her into the kitchen and say , Sigrid . I have to ask you something . Okay . <p> You have to promise to be totally honest with me . <p> Of course . <p> Is my  --  is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too big ? <p> What ? she says . I see her glance behind me for a second , and her mouth turns up in the slightest smile . <p> My head , I say , feeling panic . I know it 's enormous , but can you- <p> I 'm cut short as a pair of cold hands clamp over my eyes . I jump and let out a squeak , but the hands press tight . <p> Who is it ? I say . I sniff deeply . No cologne or perfume ; clean T-shirt smell ; faint hint of mild , almost sweet sweat . Hiiii , Erik , I say with extreme patience . <p> The hands drop , and I turn around to see Erling 's thirteen-year-old brother grinning , as pleased as he was the first twenty times he did that . <p> What 's up ? I say , tapping my foot . <p> Not much , he says . I 'm kinda bored . <p> Why are n't you downstairs kicking some Nintendo ass ? <p> He shuffles his fret . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to it ? <p> My dad smashed it with a hammer . <p> For real ? says Sigrid . Shit . <p> Why 'd he do that ? I ask . <p> I refused to say grace , he says . He lifts his chin a little . <p> Shit , Sigrid says again . <p> It 's okay , he says . I 'm gon na be out of here in five years . <p> Sigrid and I nod and look at each other . Five years , I say . <p> It 'll fly by , Sigrid says , unconvincingly . You know , I 'm kind of hungry , : Do you guys have any chips or something , Erik ? He digs two bags out of a cupboard and follows us outside to the bonfire . <p> Sigrid and I sink into a battered plaid sofa and eat potato chips while we watch Gorbachev stoke the fire . Erik tosses Bailey a Frisbee . Guys wander back and forth between the bonfire and the pool game in the garage . <p> Damn , we 're the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she cracks open a can of pop . <p> Uh-huh , I say , and I take the can from her and steal the first sip . Sigrid makes protest noises until Erling looks over and smiles . I secretly prefer it this way , . just us two . I feel uncomfortable around other girls . I have read the teen magazines they read , and I know how they  --  we  --  are trained to scrutinize and compare , develop a shipbuilder 's eye for measurement and proportion . Sigrid does n't do that with me . <p> The fire climbs . I catch Gorbachev looking at me , and I feel my head swell a fraction of a millimeter on the spot . I try to convince myself the growth was too minute to be visible . Note to self : invest in hooded sweatshirt . I turn to Sigrid and try to manufacture a vigorous conversation . I manage to get her going on Quayle . I focus my eyes intently and nod with concern . <p> Erling and Gorbachev go out to the garage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pigeons . Sigrid stops for a second . <p> Maybe you should n't do that now , she says . It 's going to be dark soon . <p> That 's why we 're doing it now , says Erling . Sigrid frowns at the gun . I uneasily watch him open the box and pull out a stack of reddish clay disks . Erik drops his Frisbee and jogs oven delighted . <p> I hate it when they do this , Sigrid says without bothering to lower her voice . Me , too , I say . <p> Erik says , What , are you scared ? <p> No . I just do n't like guns , Sigrid says . <p> The guns do n't bother me , I say . It's. the noise . <p> It 's not the noise . It 's the clay pigeons , stacked calmly in their box . I know they 're made to be destroyed , that their usefulness lies in their demise . They fly once and shatter and fall , their pieces sink into the ground . As intended . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a life , not like ours , but a strange parallel object-life , and I desperately , absurdly want the clay pigeons to remain whole . <p> Erling lifts the gun to his shoulder first . Gorbachev tosses a clay pigeon like a Frisbee up and out over the field , a dark slot in the yellowing sky . Boom , crack , suddenly it 's gone , and the pieces rain to earth . The shotgun and the shooting look strangely simple and primitive now  --  a lead bullet , a direct arc to its target . In the war everything shifted . Nothing moved as it should : targets darted sideways and backwards , missiles wiggled and swerved , televised in eerie green digital light . Out here in the cold spring evening , the shooting  --  with metal and wood and clay , the loud crack and smoky smell  --  is too real . <p> The boys whoop and give Erling five . <p> Gorbachev takes the gun , and Erling tosses the clay pigeon up into the air . A second beore Gorbachev pulls the trigger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the soaring disk , and plunge into the tall grass in the field . Bailey ! ! yell . The gun fires . <p> The day pigeon glides undisturbed through the air and descends gracefully to earth . The dog continues bounding through the field , impervious to our shouting . He stops and dips his head and then comes trotting back with the disk in his mouth . <p> Jesus Christ , says Gorbachev . <p> Erik , put the dog in his kennel , says Erling . His voice is low but a little shaky . <p> You do it , says his brother . <p> Just fucking do it , Erik . <p> I jump up . I 'll do it , I say . Come on , Bailey . I pry the clay pigeon from his mouth and slip it into nay jacket pocket  --  one saved  --  and grab his collar . His head is big and blocky , and his paws are enormous , while his ribs are puppy-skinny . I feel a surge of affinity . Hey , buddy , I say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . We go around to the far side of the garage where the chain-link kennel is built against the wall . Erik opens the door , and Bailey balks . Come on , puppy , I say . <p> A gunshot echoes , and I decide we can take our time , I kneel down to scratch the dog 's silky chocolate head . As he licks my chin , I glance up at the corner of the garage and notice a chunk of bright peach-colored wood chewed out of the gray paint . I point at it and say , Hey , Erik , what 's that ? <p> We got a porcupine , Erik says . Dad 's been trying to shoot it for a week now , but we have n't seen it yet . Get in there , Bailey , He gives the dog 's butt a firm push and latches the entrance behind him . <p> I do n't look forward to returning to the bonfire and the clay pigeon massacre , but I ca n't just hang out by the kennel making small talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we go back . Erling is sitting by Sigrid now while the other guys take turns shooting , so I sit next to him and half-listen to their conversation . I draw my knees up to my chest and watch the clay pigeons soaring , blown to pieces . Someday archaeologists will find the shards buried deep and imagine they were art , pottery , tools . <p> By the time the box of clay pigeons is empty , the fire has burned down to a low , tame flame . My head is throbbing faintly , threateningly . I finger the disk in my pocket . <p> That fire 's getting low , says Gorbachev , We 're out of wood . <p> Let 's burn that old green couch , Erling says . <p> Do n't burn the couch , I say . <p> It 's a piece of crap . <p> Someone can still use it , I plead . <p> Who would want it ? It 'll do us more good as firewood than furniture . <p> There 's no stopping them . They get a guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drag it over the fire spot , Erling pulls a branch out of the fire . The tip glows orange , and flames wind around its dark midsection . He holds up the burning limb . <p> Stand back , he tells us . He turns to the couch-bearers . Ready ? Okay . Let it go , <p> The couch drops onto the fire with a heavy thud and crack . Embers shoot out from underneath , and a cloud of soot and ashes puffs up around it . Erling touches his torch to the arm until the flame catches , then to the back and the cushions . <p> The flames eat away the canvas and burst high into the air when they hit the stuffing of the cushions . A sweet , sick smell fills the air . The wooden framework will burn long and slow . <p> My head throbs . I feel like I 'm watching a whole life burn . If the clay pigeons had brief , naive object-lives , this couch is like a generation , like a library , like a history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bull elephant or some battle-scarred ship sinking fast and without dignity . The pressure mounts in my head . I ca n't watch anymore . <p> Are you crying ? says Gorbachev . <p> My contacts are burning from the smoke , I say . I hear the dog barking and say , I 'm gon na go check on Bailey . <p> As I round the corner of the garage , the barking and snarling turns to frenzied squeals . Bailey is launched and twitching , tail tucked between his legs , yelping and whining . He tries to paw at his face , then lick his paws , and scurries back and forth in the kennel . <p> White-tipped quills protrude like stiff whiskers from the dog 's entire lace . His muzzle , damp mauve nose , lips , eyebrows , chin , throat , are pierced and swelling . Quills stick out of his chest and neck , his forelegs , his shoulders . <p> On top of the doghouse , the porcupine glares down at him , bristling , its tail a stiff spiked paddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed up and over the kennel fence and staggers swiftly into the trees . Bailey whines pitifully : <p> Erling ! Erik ! I yell . Get over here ! Quick ! <p> Erik comes running , with Erling walking behind until he figures out what happened . <p> Oh shit , oh shit , he says , over and over . <p> Erik looks panicked . That must be a hundred quills , he says . <p> It 's like two hundred quills . Erling paces along the side of the kennel . What are we going to do ? <p> I know how to get ' era out , says Erik . <p> Can you do it before Dad gets home ? says Erling . <p> I think so , says Erik . You guys can go back to the fire . <p> You 're going to need some help , I say . I 'll hold him still . <p> But I ca n't . The dog wrenches away vehemently . For a puppy he 's astonishingly strong , and his squeals and yelps are ear-shattering . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Erling 's pushing at the blazing couch with a pitchfork , and the flames climb higher and higher . Gorbachev volunteers to go , and I throw myself " back onto the sofa next to Sigrid , who puts her arm around me and says , You okay ? <p> He looks awful , I say . I 've never seen an animal in so much pain . <p> No , I said , Are you okay ? <p> I look at the flames leaping out of tile sofa . Can we go home ? <p> Okay , Sigrid says . I 'll take you home . <p> As we stand up we hear a ear door slam . Erling jumps back from the fire and drops the pitchfork . My dad 's home , he says . <p> A moment later his father comes walking over the yard toward us , arms swinging . He wears a cap and a gray down vest . Hey , kids , he says gruffly . Quite a fire you got there . He squints . You burning that old green couch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was shot . <p> About time , says his father . That thing was a piece of crap . He laughs , and the boys echo the laugh , and then we hear a sharp yelp from behind the garage . <p> The father looks toward the garage . Is that Bailey ? He smiles . Bailey ! C'mere , boy ! <p> A second later the dog comes bounding around the corner , Erik and Gorbachev stumbling after him . <p> Hey , there , buddy ! says the father , and suddenly he sees the quills and steps back . What the hell happened here ? <p> The porcupine got him . It was in his kennel , says Erling . His voice sounds different  --  higher , quieter . He says , Erik 's working on the quills . <p> I got some out already , Erik says , breathing hard . <p> Goddamn , says the father . He bends over , hands planted on his knees , and looks over Bailey 's ruined face . You 'll never get those quills out . Dog looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dad , says Erik . I 'll fix him . <p> There 's only one way to fix him , says the father . He straightens up and walks toward the garage . <p> Come on , Dad , says Erling . Do n't shoot him . <p> Dad , we can fix it , says Erik . I can get them out . I 'll stay up all night if it takes . <p> He does n't respond , but goes into the garage and comes out with the shotgun . Erik starts to beg , and his father holds up his hand and says , Do n't be a woman . <p> We all stand there , unable to watch , unable not to watch . <p> Come on , Bailey , says the father , and starts walking out into the field . The dog trots beside him , hobbling a little . Tile sky above the trees is citrine pink and orange and yellow , behind us a cool deep cobalt . <p> This is not for fucking real , Sigrid says . <p> Shut up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field and stares into the fire . The rest of us watch , transfixed . Erik is trembling . I feel oddly nothing but a tiny , steady pulse in my temple . <p> The man and the dog walk through the field , growing smaller and smaller as they move toward the woods at the far end . Soon we ca n't see Bailey anymore , just the father 's head and shoulders weaving through the Christmas trees . He stops at the border of the woods and raises the gun . <p> Sigrid covers her ears and looks down at her feet . I stare at the fixed point of the father 's head and wait . The lone shot sounds soft and faraway . No yelp , no crack , no thump . The father bends down for a minute , then stands and turns back toward the house . He grows larger with each step until he is hack in the yard , life-sized . He does n't look at us . Ill his hand is the dog 's red canvas collar , tags jingling softly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground . Then he goes on into the house . <p> Erling reaches down and picks up the collar . You tucker , he mutters . Fucking asshole . He pulls his arm back to throw the collar into the fire . <p> I ca n't take it . I say , No , Erling , do n't , and I step toward him . Why do n't you give it to me . <p> Why ? <p> It 's almost brand-new , I say . It 'd be stupid to ruin it when you could still use it . <p> Use it on what , Anya ? What the luck are we gon na use it for ? <p> Give it to me , Erling , says Erik . His eyes are full of tears , and somehow they make him look not younger but older . Erling looks at him for a second and then tosses him the collar . <p> Erik catches it . He rubs his thumb across the metal tags etched with vaccination proof , his phone number and address , the word Bailey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he throws tile collar into the fire , onto the blazing sofa . <p> I feel an almost audible snap as my scalp contracts . I feel my skull tighten and my brain begin to squeeze and condense . Ow ! I cry , and grab my temples . Everyone turns to stare at me . <p> Are you okay ? says Sigrid . <p> I try to shake my head , but it seizes sharply , and I double over . <p> Anya ? says Gorbachev . <p> Everything is flashing  --  the flames , the faces , the fields  --  and I ca n't focus my eyes . I need to find a way out . Erling 's parents are in the house . I ca n't possibly drive the car like this . I ca n't stand here with my head shrinking in front of everyone . <p> Instead , I turn and run into the field , out into the Christmas trees . Everything grows larger as my head shrinks and shrinks , and I navigate with my tiny head this unwieldy body through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
