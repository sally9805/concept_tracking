A jailed Fatah chief has put a major crimp in hopes for a smooth transition of power in the wake of the death of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat . Until last week , Mahmoud Abbas  --  Arafat 's longtime P.L.O . deputy who has the backing of the Central Committee of Fatah , the most powerful Palestinian party  --  seemed likely to roll up a big victory in the Jan. 9 election for Palestinian President . But last week Marwan Barghouti , who is serving five life sentences in an Israeli prison for his part in deadly shooting attacks early in the four-year intifadeh , announced his candidacy for the job too . Barghouti , a former moderate who now represents the radical wing of Fatah , has much greater support among ordinary Palestinians than the more moderate  --  and more aloof  --  Abbas does . At 45 , Barghouti also has the backing of younger Fatah leaders who are pressing for longtime Arafat confidants like Abbas , 69 , to reform the corrupt regime . Barghouti 's candidacy threatens to produce a major split in Fatah that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results . <P> But is Barghouti a serious candidate , or has he simply thrown his hat in the ring as a bargaining chip to win his release ? People close to Barghouti tell TIME he decided at the last minute to renege on a deal not to run , dismayed at failing to win promises from Abbas to nominate people from Barghouti 's camp for top jobs in a new administration and to push Israel for his release . A senior U.S. State Department official tells TIME he believes that Barghouti wants to leverage his threat of running for his own interests . Since Abbas controls the apparatus of the P.L.O . but has little legitimacy on the street , Barghouti could be in a strong position to demand his own release . <P> Israeli officials insist they will not free Barghouti  --  even if he stays in the race and wins the presidency . Israeli Police Minister Tzahi Hanegbi said last week that Barghouti would remain in jail " for 100 years . " But agents in the Shin Bet , Israel 's domestic security service , tell TIME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected the next Palestinian President , international pressure will force Israeli political leaders to go against the security service 's advice and release him .  --  By Matt Rees .
