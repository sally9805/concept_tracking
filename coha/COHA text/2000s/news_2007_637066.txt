<p> Ciudad Hidalgo , Mexico  --  The wide but shallow Suchiate River separating Mexico and Guatemala is no barrier . <p> Each year , hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants from Central America , most hoping to make it to the United States , cross the river on huge inner tubes and enter Mexico on the easiest part of an often hellish journey . <p> Dennis Enrique Corea , a 17-year-old Honduran , made the passage last week , hoping to travel on to Atlanta , where his aunt lives . But after setting foot on Mexican soil , Corea was confronted by soldiers , who he says stole his money and his aunt 's phone number and address . <p> " It 's like they do n't know what it 's like to suffer , " Corea said from a migrant shelter in nearby Tapachula . <p> Immigration is certain to be a major topic when President Bush visits Mexico this week . <p> But as Mexican officials vigorously defend the rights of Mexico 's immigrants in the United States , Mexico faces criticism of its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials and inhumane conditions . <p> And Mexico 's inability to seal its chaotic southern border has long been a sticking point when it comes to negotiating immigration reform with the United States . <p> Bush and the new Democrat majority support the kind of immigration laws Mexico would like to see Congress pass . <p> But before that happens , pressure is mounting on new Mexican President Felipe Calderon to fulfill his vow to fix his country 's contradictory laws and bring order to Mexico 's borders . <p> Once illegal immigrants arrive in Mexico , they face an army of corrupt and thieving officials , violent gangs called maras and dangerous rides on top of trains , which maim or kill many . <p> Mexico detained 182,705 undocumented immigrants in 2006 , and the government expects that number to rise to 204,910 this year , after 10,094 were caught in January . <p> Corea 's first attempt at reaching Atlanta was cut short last year when he slipped off a moving train and cut his foot . He was deported to Honduras after going to a hospital . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , " he said of his latest attempt . <p> When it comes to enforcing immigration laws , Mexico is caught between competing pressures , said Carmen Fernandez , an immigration expert at College of the Southern Border in southern Mexico . <p> On one side is the pressure to stop the flood of Central Americans heading north . <p> On the other , there are calls to respect the human rights of Central Americans . Officials know any abuse leaves them open to charges of hypocrisy . <p> " For the migrants that try to cross Mexico 's border , we ca n't give less guarantees than those we demand for Mexican migrants , " said Mexico 's immigration chief , Cecilia Romero . <p> Calderon is expected to announce a series of changes , including an expanded temporary-work visa program for Central Americans and improvements to immigration detention centers , which critics say can be dungeon-like . He already has formed special border police . <p> But at the top of most migrant advocates ' list is changing a 33-year-old law that makes illegal entry into Mexico a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not only did Mexican leaders howl when U.S. Republicans proposed similar legislation , but observers say corrupt police often use the threat of prison to demand bribes . <p> With little money to cross Mexico , a small percentage of the illegal migrants reach the United States . Francisco Aceves , local coordinator of Grupos Beta , the government agency charged with protecting migrants , believes less than 20 percent make it . <p> For Jose Francisco Gonzalez , a baby-faced Salvadoran father of two , reaching the United States has become a vocation . <p> Francisco , 24 , has spent a quarter of his life attempting to reach Houston and a promised job with his uncle . He 's tried at least four times , and last year got as far as Laredo , Texas , before the U.S. Border Patrol caught him . <p> Unlike Mexican immigrants , who are deposited on the other side of the U.S.-Mexico border , Central Americans face deportation back to homelands thousands of miles away . <p> Francisco 's eyes well up as he remembers the frustration of getting so close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me up , " he said fiddling with hands crisscrossed by scars from cutting sugar cane in El Salvador . " It cost so much effort to get there . " <p> Now he 's trying again , but his " trip has been a disaster so far . " <p> Shortly after crossing the Suchiate River on a raft , he was attacked by robbers , he said , who made off with all his money . He walked to a Tapachula shelter , where he is trying to regroup . <p> He plans on begging or looking for work so he can get enough money for a phone card to call his uncle and ask him to wire more money . <p> " If God wants me to arrive , then I 'll make it , " he said . <p> Perhaps nothing exemplifies the contradictory nature of Mexico 's immigration system than Grupos Beta . Although it 's part of the immigration agency whose goal is to catch and deport migrants , Grupos Beta is a humanitarian organization , whose members carry water and crackers instead of guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grupos Beta is often their only friend . On a recent afternoon , Aceves patrolled an isolated section of railroad track notorious for attacks by gang members who prey on migrants . <p> In 2005 , Hurricane Stan wiped out the railroad tracks along the border , <p> so migrants have to walk about 150 miles to the nearest train depot in Arriaga to hop a train north . <p> Near the tracks , orchards of towering mango trees and groves of ripening papaya belie the danger the crossers face . Aceves comes upon a group of three who try to hide when they see his orange truck . <p> " It 's OK ! " Aceves shouts . " We 're here to help you . We 'll give you food . " <p> The men approach the truck , where Aceves gives them tins of tuna , pamphlets and water and reminds them that only federal agents can demand their documents . <p> " We invite them to make a complaint against corrupt police , but they 're usually too scared and worried that they will get deported , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nearly 95 percent of undocumented immigrants detained in Mexico are from Central America , and about half are caught in the southern border state of Chiapas . Their countries of origin include : <p> Guatemala ... 46.3 percent <p> Honduras ... 31.7 percent <p> El Salvador ... 14.9 percent <p> Nicaragua ... 2 percent <p> Other ... 5.1 percent <p> THE NUMBERS <p> Officials say poor economies and increasing gang violence in Central America caused a spike in apprehensions in 2004-2005 .
