The Rosario was the deepest canyon in the world . Four thousand meters , twice as deep as the Grand , cut by a fast , north-flowing river of the same name which eventually turned eastward to braid itself into the Amazon . A chasm full of sky , too vast to think about . Even those times when Maggie was actually standing on the Rosario 's top rim , she could never quite withstand the sight of it . She always had the same unbidden thought : This can not be real . So much void , full of so much hazy hanging light ; and the opposite wall striped like a tiger ( Cretaceous limestones , according to her grandfather , who had been the first to map them ) ; and past it , the black horizon ; and past even that , the rain forest , invisible on the back slopes but sending up sweet white puffs of cloud in the afternoons . The rain forest , full of ruins and bones and gold but uninhabited , stretched endlessly , the local people said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the bottom of all this was Piedras , barely clinging to the slim gravelly terraces of the Rosario River , which was cutting all too quickly through soft rock , rushing to attain the level of the sea . In Piedras , where Maggie and her husband , Carson , were living , all was airless heat and flies and bushes coated in dust . Somehow it never seemed to have sufficient reason for existing , let alone the importance it had possessed in Maggie 's imagination ever since she was a child . Back in February , when she and Carson had first arrived , Maggie had known immediately that she would never get used to the bus ride . It was near the end of the rainy season , and the road from Cajamarca had only recently been reopened after a section fell off during a torrential December rain . Going over the canyon 's western lip , the bus had tilted like a roller coaster , and her stomach had dropped away . She could not see the bottom of the canyon , just the road like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mountains . The canyon was vast , unexpected , a hole in the ground bigger than any idea of it could ever be . Then its east wall rose up , suddenly contradicting everything , a frozen angry-looking wave of black stone . Distant details were clear , grainy as in an excellent photograph , so that Maggie felt she could have picked out a fly on a cliff face . " Cliff tombs , " she said to Carson , " waterfalls ! " Her grandmother Althea had told stories of the strange things hidden in the canyon 's folded cliffs . Tombs , waterfalls where you could take a shower . Maggie could almost feel a rope of frigid water shattering against her own skull , driving out every thought ; and how it would feel , then , to step out onto the bare , bright , burning trail again : clothing drying instantly , skin staying cool . Carson was making a guess that the canyon sides were about twelve miles apart . Twelve miles , Maggie thought . How far was that ? How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A cold wind whistled through the cracked window as the bus began threading its way down through standing rocks that looked like a demolished , or an about to be constructed , Inca fortress , of the type she and Carson had visited last week in the southern part of the co untry . They 'd taken a honeymoon in Cuzco and Machu Picchu before settling down to a year of serious work , reopening Piedras 's medical clinic . " So then do n't look , " Carson said as Maggie gripped his thigh . But she could n't stop . The chasm drew her in ; its emptiness exerted a suction . In comparison , the road was too narrow . For the first time she realized what defined the edge of any mountain road . Nothing . Nothing was fine on its own terms . That was exactly what was wrong with it . The road here was slimy white mud with big rocks in it and turns without protection , all causing the driver to manhandle the wheel , hand over hand ; and to anticipate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and topheavy , too , partly because of Maggie and Carson 's gear tied to a rack on the roof . They had purchased a small refrigerator in Cajamarca and had it reinforced with iron straps . If only this refrigerator could be sacrificed , she thought , they 'd all have a chance to survive . The road grew worse as it went down , mostly because the mud got deeper . Though it had n't rained in a week , none of the mud had hardened . It did change from white to red , and brown , and yellow . Some places were as badly churned as if an army had recently retreated along them , full of ruts and hoofprints and the tracks of the heavy equipment that had gone down to repair the bad section , which was still ahead . Steering and braking would have been difficult under the best of circumstances , Maggie thought , but now the driver seemed desperate , wrestling with the wheel . Likely this bus had things wrong with it , such as thin brake shoes , loo se @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet of muddy skid . What if another vehicle came at them around these blind , unprotected curves ? Fortunately , the bus was going downward ; because of this , it stayed next to the mountain 's body instead of the edge . The road was barely wider than one lane , so the bus would push any opponent off , but Maggie found little comfort in that idea . One day she 'd have to leave , and it would be her turn on the outside . Carson pointed out a wooden cross on the shoulder . " Third World warning sign , " he joked . " Comforting , are n't they ? " Maggie said sarcastically . Grateful for an excuse to talk , she told him how , when she and her sister were little , in Mexico and in Colombia , they 'd ritually crossed themselves each time they 'd passed a roadside memorial , despite not being Catholic . " The maids taught you how , " guessed Carson . " You know me well . " Their Colombian maid , Gloria , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories so enthralling that Maggie and Sonia had never needed games , nor pinched each other . The bus heaved up to the point of a curve where a thicket of crosses surrounded a hutch of raw cement . With her right hand , Maggie performed a series of quick figure eights , fingertips swooping just short of her lips . " Bad spots are a lot of work , " she said , though she could n't remember any place as bad as this one . A whole bus must have gone off the edge here . Carson leaned forward to peer at Maggie from the front . She was doing the crossbar backwards , he said . " That 's Greek Orthodox or something . " He ought to know : he had been brought up Catholic . Gently he corrected her , brushing his fingertips across her breasts . Left to right , opening her heart like a door - or closing it , depending on which side she imagined the hinges . She crossed herself Carson 's way at the next bend , kissing her fingertips at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lap . Despite the dire reminder , she was glad to see the crosses . They returned her to herself . It was curious too , she thought , how Carson saw them in reference to safe , North American highway warning signs . He 'd grown up in Baton Rouge , in the same house all his life . When he spoke , she could feel his childhood inside him , a solid grid of hamburger stands , summer lawns , blacktopped highways sticky in the sun . Maggie Goodwin had been born in Mexico . She 'd lived there until she was five , and then the family moved to Colombia . She was ten and her sister Sonia thirteen when their father 's shoe factory had failed unexpectedly . Calvin Goodwin 's Colombian partner had suggested to the authorities that they might inspect the books , enforce certain laws that protected against imperialism . Calvin 's capital became the fine . By coincidence , Sonia had caught typhoid in the same month when Maggie 's mother had begun firing the servants , packing some things , selling others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so Maggie first blamed her older sister and then her mother , Julia , for their departure . Julia kept insisting she was overjoyed to go back to the United States . She 'd had it with the chaos , envy , and dishonesty that ruled the rest of the world . Then Maggie had known that her mother was betraying herself , not to speak of everybody else in the family . Julia had been born in Bengal , and brought up in all the most unstable places , Peru , Turkey , Chile , India , and Afghanistan , where her father , a seismologist , had studied the world 's most grievous faults . Maggie 's grandmother Althea could always draw a protest from Julia by joking that Julia 's dark hair and fathomless eyes came from all the Indian sun Althea had absorbed while pregnant . Maggie 's features were almost the same . Maggie liked to think of India as an explanation for her own thin ankles , and the way her skin turned yellowish when she was tired , and for the tiny hook at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water beginning to form under a faucet . Julia would n't hear it , any of it . Her father , Johnny Baines , had always attributed Julia 's coloration to a Cherokee great-grandmother of his . To the end of his life , he 'd called Julia his Indian princess , Princess Oh-What-a-Part-o-Me . Princess indeed : as soon as she 'd reached ninth grade , Julia asked to leave Ecuador , where Johnny was inspecting the Cotopaxi volcano , and go to a Swiss boarding school instead . Not long afterward , arthritis and financial stress put an end to Johnny 's geological explorations . Despite his reputation for eccentric thinking ( he was determined to produce a theory predicting earthquakes ) , he 'd gotten a job lecturing at Harvard , based on his work measuring tension in stable rocks . Maggie was the opposite of her mother . She 'd always been glad of her dark hair and eyes , jealo us that her parents had given Sonia a name that was the same in Spanish . She blamed the United States for causing her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including , eventually , itself . As for her father , Calvin Goodwin , Maggie had always understood how hard he had fought to escape from Connecticut . Through all her childhood , he 'd seemed a foreigner in the family , paler than his wife and daughters , the red-haired gringo Julia married . They 'd seen him as if from a distance , slurping his dinner cold long after the girls and their mother had eaten , alone in the dark kitchen , late home from his factory . He 'd sit worrying over his papers on a Sunday in his study , his presence defining the farthest room in every house . She 'd been shocked to realize that it was Calvin who had held them in particular places on the surface of the earth ; when he 'd lost his grip , the rest must lose theirs , too . He 'd been happiest in Colombia , but in the end he 'd been lucky to get a job in his family 's hardware distribution business , outside Bridgeport . His snake-proof boots grew mold in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad section of road : even softer mud than elsewhere , nothing but a few tons of new dirt dug out of the hillside and pushed together . Carson said , " Maggie , look . " There was the old road , a small landslide spilling down for about a hundred yards before it reached the edge of a cliff and disappeared . To Maggie 's relief , the bus got stuck here , in an awesome slough where some kind of quicksand lurked at the bottom of a puddle twenty yards long . The driver and his helper donned rubber boots and first tried tossing some cabbage-sized rocks under the wheels . Soon they had to ask all of the men to get out and push . Maggie would have liked to help , but she was told to sit inside with the other women . At least , she thought , there was little danger of the men 's pushing the bus too far . She watched as her new husband took off his hiking boots and rolled up his jeans as far as he could , revealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark , fine French hairs . She told him she was worried that he 'd cut his foot on something sharp . " Pfft , " said Carson , stepping into calf-deep , murky water . Despite twenty men 's heaving , the bus rocked only slightly . The driver 's boy stuck his head in to announce that the women must get out , too , in order to lighten the burden . Maggie declined his offer to be carried piggyback across the puddle , but the other two women accepted . She took off her shoes and waded through the opaque brown water . The bottom was silky , safe , the water cold . Oh , it was grand to stand on solid ground again . Soon the bus was high and dry , a matter of rocks and ropes and grunting . Several men celebrated , sipping from a flat bottle . Carson had a slug , then came up to where Maggie stood on a tussock of muddy alpine grass that seemed to have been chewed down by sheep . " What was it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's coated all my teeth . " He wiped one hand across his beard . His forehead already bore a streak of war paint . " Whew , that was rough . You okay ? You look kind of pale . " &n; bsp ; " I wish I had an excuse to walk the rest of the way . " " Want to go home ? " He meant it , she saw . " No . " " Good ! " Maggie did n't speak to him again until they had sat down and the bus had begun to roll . Then she said , in a carefully quiet tone , " I ca n't wait to get to Piedras . It 's just that I hate being trapped inside this box . I 'd rather be in a truck I could jump out of . " " If we die , we die , that 's my attitude , " Carson said . " If ? " Maggie said . She returned to gazing out the window . How dare he think he belonged here more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was ahead of her . Even if she hated the road , she already loved the canyon . Its immensity drew her into a focused , particular joy , so that she felt she had discovered it herself . In fact , she had rights over it , at least compared to Carson . Her uncle had been conceived in Piedras , according to an intricate and perhaps unreliable story of her grandmother 's . That was why , when she and Carson had been searching for a place to do health work together , and the name of Piedras had scrolled down the computer screen in white letters on royal blue , Maggie had stood up and looked for an atlas , then phoned her grandmother . First thing the next morning , she 'd called up Catholic Charities , begging them to modify the job to accommodate two North Americans : a physician 's assistant and an administrator-trainee . They agreed , perhaps because the post had gone begging for so long , or because Maggie had insisted , as her grandmother Al thea was famous for doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Getting to Peru must be the greatest achievement of her life so far - the only deed , Maggie thought , that had ever flowed from her own true character . She hoped happiness would ensue , of course , though she knew happiness was often too much to expect . This trip was an experiment , to see what resulted from acting purely on the intuitions of one 's heart . Her friends approved of her leaving Larry , they just thought she should have stopped there , rather than remarrying and running off to South America two weeks after the divorce was finalized . " Far , " and " away , " Maggie had argued , were relative concepts . Far from what ? Away from what ? In her own mind , she was running toward something . From the point of view of Piedras , it was the United States that would seem distant and bizarre . Moreover , she loved Carson and he loved her , and she was pretty sure of both these things even though they 'd known each other less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic Charities , which would not have allowed them to work together otherwise . Maggie had n't revealed this detail to her mother , for whom Carson 's willingness to marry her questionable daughter was his chief merit . Julia Goodwin believed that a wedding band was a woman 's first line of defense , all over the world , beginning in her own house . She 'd even pushed for Maggie to take Carson 's name , Miller , but Maggie had refused , claiming she disliked the initials MM , which was true . She told Julia she 'd do it the grand old Latin way , " Maggie Goodwin de Miller , " and left it to her moth er to recall how good it was that Maggie had never let herself become " Mrs. Larry Fabularo . " People made big changes all the time , Maggie thought . There would always be voices , inside and out , shouting reasons why one should n't . If this venture did n't work , she could always go back and make peace with a half-life , like everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing she had to lose . Until then , at the very least , she and Carson were in this together . She jerked her head back , a reflex , for her window had come within inches of an outcrop . The bus had not ceased to fling its passengers violently about , lurching unpredictably on several tilt-axes at once , as if attempting to dislodge their vital organs . Carson turned away and stuck his long legs into the aisle to avoid crushing his knees against the steel back of the seat ahead of him . Absurd , under these conditions , to wish for him to kiss her . If she wanted a kiss , the back of his neck was available , but then she ran the risk of crushing her lips between Carson 's spine and her own incisors . She picked out a dark spot on the opposite wall of the canyon , a cave , or maybe just a huge black spot of mildew that had dripped from the roots of the hanging vegetation . This scenery justified everything it had taken to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning to him again and finding , happily , that he was facing in her direction . She asked permission to lick a speck of mud off the corner of his eyebrow . " No , " he said , but he was tickled , she could see ; he permitted her to rub it off with the ball of her thumb while wit h the other hand , invisible to the other passengers , she caressed his penis . He clamped his hand between his legs for a few seconds . " Dirty girl , " he said approvingly . By now both of their clothes were dry . Halfway down , still before you could see the river bottom , the canyon had suddenly turned into a desert . A rain shadow , Maggie explained : the upper slopes took all the moisture . Cactus and mesquite grew here , just like in a western , but there were orchids in the jacaranda trees . Nothing smaller than trees grew from the bare yellowish dirt . The road here was no less bad , except for being dry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cracking off and falling to the floor . Dust came in the windows until Maggie 's teeth were gritty . She exulted when the bus finally rattled off the wall of the canyon onto the relief of the river flats . She pinched her husband 's biceps . " We 're here . I ca n't believe it . I 'm totally happy . " Carson pinched her back , more gently . " Yeah , I know . " They were entering a mango grove , surely the same one her grandmother had talked about . You could hear the river even in the bus . These crumbling buildings must belong to the hacienda , maybe the same one where Althea and Johnny might have taken shelter after their raft broke up in the whirlpool , back in 1932 or so - her grandmother was bad at years . " Piedras , Arenas , Aguas , Piedras . Yes , " Althea had said . Did Carson remember hearing about the raft that had the live cow tied to the back of it ? He did not , even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marvels of her grandparents ' trip . What could have distracted him ? The cow 's fate had worried her deeply as a child . Which was worse , she had kept trying to decide : drowning tied up or having your throat slit by someone who had taken care of you all your life ? She 'd asked her grandparents about it again and again . Sometimes they did n't remember . Other times they just said whatever came into their heads - that they had sold her to someone before they reached the whirlpool , that they had eaten her somewhere downstream . Even today , with a fervor strong enough it could almost alter the past , Maggie still hoped that the cow had swum to shore . " Points for spotting our first patient . See that guy on the verandah ? " Carson pointed out . The man , about sixty , was staring at the bus . His clothes were so old they had turned the color of river water . " Why is he our patient ? What does he have ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Maggie said . " What could we do for him ? You ca n't operate , right ? " " We 'll get a doctor down here . Line up all the cases , guy comes down for a few days ? The surgery 's easy . " " Great . I 'll write the letters , translate the interviews . " Maggie saw herself in the modest dark skirt she 'd brought for formal purposes , persuading the Cajamarca health officer , a fat bureaucrat in aviator sunglasses , to disburse some tiny amount of funds . " We 'll do it , " Carson promised . Satisfied , Maggie went back to inspecting the hacienda , which consisted of several buildings and many walls . A trio of ragged children stood in a doorway . They might have been the same children who appeared in all villages . Maggie waved at them . The littlest one balled up a fist and lifted it halfheartedly to her mouth . This hacienda must have been abandoned by its owner in the agrarian reform , then taken over by local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains of grace . Through the trees , Maggie glimpsed the chapel where Grandma Althea had looked into the glass eyes of the saint . Here was an iron bridge , the only means of crossing the river for many days ' travel in either direction . They crossed , the bus tires loud on dusty planks , and almost immediately passed a low adobe building with a corrugated roof . It stood far from its neighbors , between the road and the river , and was painted a thick , shabby government-green with a blood-red cross . " That 's it , " Carson cried , " that 's our clinic ! " Shuttered for years , the building did n't offer any encouragement . " Looks pretty well closed , " Maggie observed . It had been shut down five years ago , due to generalized subversive activity in rural Peru . Maggie had checked carefully , finding a few bombings and assassinations in Cajamarca , the nearest big city , but nothing in the Rosario area . Piedras was remote from everything , including terrorism . Now most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of the mountains had been officially pacified . After years of internal warfare and lack of foreign in vestment , the new government could n't afford to run its rural health care system , so international organizations had stepped in . Carson and Maggie had a one-year contract with Catholic Charities . If things went well , it would be renewed , but eventually the goal was to replace the gringos with Peruvians . Now they were arriving in what they would soon call downtown Piedras . On the left side of the road , against the mountains , were more mango groves , and cane fields and corn and some low leafy stuff , probably vegetables . All this must be irrigated from the river . The first houses were half hidden behind a long fence of living cactus and hibiscus plants that were choked with road dust . No one came out to wave . One woman was trudging alongside the road . She stood aside , turning her back and putting her hand over her face against the bus 's passing . So this was Piedras : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall of the canyon . Call them adobe or mud brick , they were of mud plastered together with mud , most of them unpainted , with corrugated roofs , shaded by mango trees and papaya trees with fruit like giant milky breasts . The stringy road ran in one end of town and out the other along the river 's terrace . Skinny dogs slept curled up in the soft dust at the bottom of potholes . If a truck or the bus came ( all year , there would be only one car ) , the dogs got up leisurely , inches ahead of the oncoming wheels , and sauntered off not looking back . At the center of town was the general store , with a small area of beaten earth in front of it , the main arena for Piedras 's social life . On that first day , as on most days , the store own er had set out a lawn chair and collapsed into it , so relaxed that when Maggie first caught sight of him , she had felt with a little thrill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he was only Don Nasir , the Syrian . As Maggie would soon learn , he was a person who did not rise to occasions unless rising was profitable . The bus shuddered to a halt . So this was the center of town . Maggie spied a man sprawling face-down in the sun next to the door of the general store , inert as death . Suddenly she felt a gut-sinking certainty that , having confirmed the existence of the canyon , river , hacienda , chapel , and mango grove , she had already done all that was possible for her here . The bus would leave , and she and Carson would stay , and there was nothing for them . No school , no phone , no post office , no movie house . No doctor other than Carson , and Carson was only a physician 's assistant , though he 'd worked for twenty years overseas and knew more about wounds and tropical diseases than many M.D.s . " Oh , God , I 'm sorry , " she whispered , almost involuntarily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his feet , revealing a face half covered with bright fresh blood . He turned . " What did you say ? " " Nothing . " The passengers were crowding into the aisle all at once , pulling bags and boxes with them . The drunk fell down onto his hands and knees . " Terrible , " Maggie said . " He 's the reason we came . " Carson began p ushing forward through the struggling passengers . Maggie wondered whether she should follow , translate , but he 'd left her with all their hand luggage . Besides , he had n't asked for help . Before coming here , he 'd requested that Maggie not hover excessively or worry about translating for him . He knew how to make himself understood ; he 'd done it in Thailand , India , Angola . The drunk struggled to his feet again and zigzagged toward the bus , each step correcting a severe mistake made by the previous foot . He laughed at the disembarking passengers , who insulted him in return . A short , barrel-shaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think this way , but his face looked coarse and corrupted . His lips were purple , turned inside out . His forearms covered with blurring tattoos - one was a tick-tack-toe . He and Carson met at the bottom of the bus 's stairs . Maggie saw Carson step down onto the ground and raise his right hand tenderly toward the drunk man 's cheek , indicating the bleeding wound . The drunk pulled his head back like a boxer and said something that gave his face an ugly look . Carson gathered a couple of supporters who seemed to be trying to explain to the drunk that he was offering help . At some point the message reached the drunk man 's central nerve ganglion and he made an even uglier face than before . He put out his hand , insolently begging for money . At this , Maggie slung all of the hand luggage about her body and squeezed forward through the aisle , straps catching , bags banging against the seats . Carson had given up and gone around the back o f the bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the handrail at the bus steps , swaying as if a wind were blowing from the opening of the door . Clearly he intended to climb the steps and was only waiting for Maggie to start down them . She waved at him to get on and he did . His smell was complex , shocking . The bus driver explained to Maggie that this man was a minero and had spent the weekend drinking in Piedras . He had drunk , and fought , and slept , and his paycheck was gone , and now he wanted a ride back to La Tormentosa , the gold mine eight hours uphill , but he had no money left . " This man is from Huancayo , " the bus driver concluded . " He is not from our zone . " " Here you do n't drink like that ? " " Oh , no , here we drink until we crawl home on all fours ! Get on , " he said to the drunk . " Sit down , you man without a conscience . " Maggie thanked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bus , trying to slow the boy helper , who was flinging their bags and boxes from the roof of the bus directly onto the ground . Three men struggled to lift down the refrigerator , but having completed this task , they disappeared . The bus drove off , leaving Maggie and Carson standing amidst an immense amount of stuff . Together , they dragged their suitcases and boxes closer to the store . The refrigerator was a small one , but very heavy with its lockable iron straps , so they left it in what , now that the bus had pulled away , had again become the middle of the road . The man in the lawn chair watched them , still immobile . A boy with a shaven head was fanning him with a folded glossy magazine . They walked into the store wondering who was responsible . The air smelled edible , thick : motor oil , cheap perfume , dust , rancid flour , sunlight , cigars , and last night 's frying onions . Voices could be heard from the back room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long tables covered with plastic , with vases of dirty plastic flowers and napkin holders stuffed with sharp triangles of wax paper . A couple of used tumblers remained at the end of one table , with two related chairs pushed back at careless angles . A poster of a fat , garish baby decorated one wall . Carson said it looked like an ad for contraception . They leaned over the glass counter , peering into the kitchen . It seemed deserted . Under the counter they saw wax matches and cigarettes , sold one by one from an open box . Carson pointed out a tiny brass scale , a miniature of the one used by blindfolded Justice ; soon they 'd learn that it was used for weighing gold dust . Maggie liked the dried piranha , apparently not for sale ; and the loops of PVC joints , faucets , and machetes clipped to nylon ropes , festooned diagonally under the ceiling . Shovels , pickaxes , and hoes leaned in a corner . There were stacked boxes of yellow and blue batteries , hinges and chisels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt , and a small shelf of items where the beautification of women commingled with good and bad sorcery : jasmine soap , bleaching cream , Florida water , myrrh , envelopes smelling of sulfur with dollar signs on the front , love soap , mo ney soap , soap to get rid of devils . Carson called out , " Hey ! Hola ! " Eventually a woman came out . She was about four feet tall , stout , and her face had a kind expression . She wore a green-and-white-checked pinafore . Maggie explained in her best voice that this was her husband , a doctor , el Seor Doctor Miller , and that she was his wife and assistant and trainee , Seora Margarita Goodwin de Miller . They were here to open the clinic . They had brought many things with them but would purchase more . Just now they needed transport . Was there a taxi , any kind of vehicle for hire ? " Nasir ! " the woman howled , and went back into the kitchen . At last the man unfolded from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver . His shiny skin and small mustache reminded Maggie of a card shark ; in another life , he would have worn a Panama hat . " Nasir , " he said , offering his hand to Carson , but not to Maggie . She stepped forward and put her own hand out . With some surprise , Nasir took it . While she repeated their introduction , Nasir smiled and actually rubbed his hands together . At the end he said he had a truck that he would rent to them for fifty soles . " Fifty ! " Maggie said . This was almost twenty dollars . The clinic was a thousand yards away . " Tell him we expect a discount , " Carson said . " Tell him we 'll be buying all our food from him for a year . And tell him we may need to rent his truck at other times . Maybe , you know , we 'll have some emergency and we 'll have to drive someone up to Cajamarca Hospital in it . Oh , and ask him if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're so smart , " she told him . Yesterday , the Cajamarca health officer had announced that there was no longer a key for the Piedras clinic . " The padlocks are Chinese , " Nasir told them . Taking one from under the counter , he showed where to strike it so that the lock sprang open . " Descuento , " Maggie reminded him . " On the truck . " Nasir said he paid to have all of the gasoline trucked here from the city . Surely they appreciated his difficulties . " Ten soles , " Maggie said , wondering why Nasir did n't drive the truck to Cajamarca and load it with barrels of fuel . They agreed on fifteen . The truck was stoutly chained into its own dark shed , a monster rarely allowed to emerge . When it did , it was so enormous that Maggie almost understood why Nasir had wanted fifty soles . He could have charged five just to look at it . Its rust-brown cab had a tall oval grill like whale baleen . Its windshield was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shielded by a narrow aluminum eyebrow . The gas cap was a petroleum-soaked rag that converted the whole thing into a rolling bomb . Tent cloth had been draped over part of its back platform , which was wood planks , surfaces white and eroded soft as suede . The planks were so long that Maggie was sure Nasir had stolen them off the bridge , which , she recalled , had been missing several . &nb; sp ; The bridge had not existed when Althea was here , Maggie was sure of that .
