IF YOU RIDE THROUGH YOUR TEENS , IT DEFINES YOU . Like it does Brian Hancock , 18 . He is n't who most of us were ( or are , or will become ) . He shaves his legs . Has a drawer full of Lycra . Spends his spare time training . He just moved away from home to Michigan State University-and despite the excitement of living on his own and striking out into the wild world of college , the thing he gets most enthused about is riding . " I brought my cyclocross bike with me , " he says , " and I 'll bring my mountain bike later . Riding with the State collegiate team is awesome . There are plenty of good riders to train with , and it 's a change for me because I do n't normally train with guys my age ! " Brian Hancock is the true , rare , uninterrupted lifelong  --  cyclist-in-the-making , the odd kid who never got seduced away from bikes by a driver 's license . So very few of us ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls age 16 found that cycling did n't even rank among their favorite 12 sports-less than 3% participation . ( By age 34 , both men and women peg cycling among their top 12 . ) It all makes sense . As we enter our teens we 're strong and skilled and ready for independence-and the bike is our best means of gaining it . The bike is our car . There are some athletes drawn to cycling , of course-but junior high and high school are little mirrors of society , and just as cycling is a niche in the adult world of ball sports , so it is a tiny slice of adolescent sports . ( With no cheerleaders , school-sanctioned legacy , pep rallies , letter jackets or paid coaches , either . And you ever try letting flash a pair of shaved legs in a guy 's shower room in high school ? ) So the bike is a car . Except it is not , and when the real thing comes along , why there you go . You have to be a little weird , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe some of all of that-to ride a bike through your teen years . Some of us pull it off , finding a hodgepodge circle of friends who also ride , getting jobs at the local shops , plastering our rooms with posters not of rock stars or legendary beauties but of skinny Europeans with funny names . We do n't know how you did it , Brian Hancock , 18 , self-described road , mountain and cyclocross racer . But we 're glad you did . WHAT 'S THE BEST THING ABOUT RIDING ? " It 's a way to stay fit , have fun and be competitive that most people do n't do-it 's a way to be different but work hard . It 's a lifelong sport , it 's different for everyone and everyone has different goals . I brought my dad into recreational cycling . Forty years from now I hope to help my kids in cycling . " CYCLING AND HIGH SCHOOL ? " Being a serious cyclist in your teen years ... there 's no school cycling team-except for some in Colorado . Too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'd go out and win or do an impressive ride , but the whole school would n't know anything about it-it 's not like they announce it over the PA system Monday morning . Cycling 's all about not getting any recognition except from your family and close friends . Nobody stops you in the hall and says Nice sprint last weekend . ' " WHAT 'D YOU LEARN ? " You ca n't go to any race and not learn something-and no two races are alike . In ' 98 , my team went to junior nationals , and we were all confident . We went there thinking we were going to do something-but got completely railed ! It was a little depressing and a real eye-opener-there are a lot of fast guys out there . I still get toasted by 40- and 50  --  year olds on rides . It gives you some perspective to ride with a guy who 's 50 and still strong as heck , and experienced too . I look forward to getting physically and mentally stronger , but if I could choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your youth , the lack of experience makes a big difference . " WHY HE STARTED RIDING " I remember watching Greg LeMond win the Tour de France on TV , but I did n't really get into it until middle school . My older sister had a friend who raced locally . That 's what led to the single most changing moment of my life  --  there 's 5 inches of snow on the ground and the doorbell rings . It 's the racer guy out for a training ride , stopping by to say hi . It 's freezing outside and he 's out there training-I could n't believe the dedication of someone out there training in the middle of winter in Michigan . From that moment on , I was into it .
