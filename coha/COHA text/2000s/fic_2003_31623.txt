Chapter One My girlfriend was fifteen percent of my age , and I was old-fashioned enough that it bugged me . Her name was Lil , and she was second-generation Disney World , her parents being among the original ad-hocracy that took over the management of Liberty Square and Tom Sawyer Island . She was , quite literally , raised in Walt Disney World , and it showed . It showed . She was neat and efficient in her every little thing , from her shining red hair to her careful accounting of each gear and cog in the animatronics that were in her charge . Her folks were in canopic jars in Kissimmee , deadheading for a few centuries . On a muggy Wednesday , we dangled our feet over the edge of the Liberty Belle 's riverboat pier , watching the listless Confederate flag over Fort Langhorn on Tom Sawyer Island by moonlight . The Magic Kingdom was all closed up and every last guest had been chased out the gate underneath the Main Street train station , and we were able to breathe a heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and relax together while the cicadas sang . I was more than a century old , but there was still a kind of magic in having my arm around the warm , fine shoulders of a girl by moonlight , hidden from the hustle of the cleaning teams by the turnstiles , breathing the warm , moist air . Lil plumped her head against my shoulder and gave me a butterfly kiss under my jaw . " Her name was McGill , " I sang , gently . " But she called herself Lil , " she sang , warm breath on my collarbones . " And everyone knew her as Nancy , " I sang . I 'd been startled to know that she knew the Beatles . They 'd been old news in my youth , after all . But her parents had given her a thorough-if eclectic-education . " Want to do a walk-through ? " she asked . It was one of her favorite duties , exploring every inch of the rides in her care with the lights on , after the horde of tourists had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic . Maybe that was why I kept picking at the relationship . " I 'm a little pooped . Let 's sit a while longer , if you do n't mind . " She heaved a dramatic sigh . " Oh , all tight . Old man . " She reached up and gently tweaked my nipple , and I gave a satisfying little jump . I think the age difference bothered her , too , though she teased me for letting it get to me . " I think I 'll be able to manage a totter through the Haunted Mansion , if you just give me a moment to rest my bursitis . " I felt her smile against my shirt . She loved the Mansion ; loved to turn on the ballroom ghosts and dance their waltz with them on the dusty floor , loved to try and stare down the marble busts in the library that followed your gaze as you passed . I liked it too , but I really liked just sitting there with her , watching the water and the trees . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft ping inside my cochlea . " Damn , " I said . " I 've got a call . " " Tell them you 're busy , " she said . " I will , " I said , and answered the call subvocally . " Julius here . " " Hi , Julius . It 's Dan . You got a minute ? " I knew a thousand Dans , but I recognized the voice immediately , though it 'd been ten years since we last got drunk at the Gazoo together . I muted the subvocal and said , " Lil , I 've got to take this . Do you mind ? " " Oh , no , not at all , " she sarcased at me . She sat up and pulled out her crack pipe and lit up . " Dan , " I subvocalized , " long time no speak . " " Yeah , buddy , it sure has been , " he said , and his voice cracked on a sob . I turned and gave Lil such a look , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , softly but swiftly . I waved her off and switched the phone to full-vocal mode . My voice sounded unnaturally loud in the cricket-punctuated calm . " Where you at , Dan ? " I asked . " Down here , in Orlando . I 'm stuck out on Pleasure Island . " " All right , " I said . " Meet me at , uh , the Adventurer 's Club , upstairs on the couch by the door . I 'll be there in- " I shot a look at Lil , who knew the castmember-only roads better than I. She flashed ten fingers at me . " Ten minutes . " " OK , " he said . " Sorry . " He had his voice back under control . I switched off . " What 's up ? " Lil asked . " I 'm not sure . An old friend is in town . He sounds like he 's got a problem . " Lil pointed a finger at me and made a triggersqueezing gesture . " There , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pleasure Island to your public directory . Keep me in the loop , okay ? " I set off for the utilidor entrance near the Hall of Presidents and booted down the stairs to the hum of the underground tunnel-system . I took the slidewalk to cast parking and zipped my little cart out to Pleasure Island . I found Dan sitting on the L-shaped couch underneath rows of faked-up trophy shots with humorous captions . Downstairs , castmembers were working the animatronic masks and idols , chattering with the guests . Dan was apparent fifty-plus , a little paunchy and stubbled . He had raccoon-mask bags under his eyes and he slumped listlessly . As I approached , I pinged his Whuffie and was startled to see that it had dropped to nearly zero . " Jesus , " I said , as I sat down next to him . " You look like hell , Dan . " He nodded . " Appearances can be deceptive , " he said . " But in this case , they 're bang-on . " " You want to talk about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I hear they ring in the New Year every night at midnight ; I think that 'd be a little too much for me right now . " I led him out to my cart and cruised back to the place I shared with Lil , out in Kissimmee . He smoked eight cigarettes on the twenty minute ride , hammering one after another into his mouth , filling my runabout with stinging clouds . I kept glancing at him in the rear-view . He had his eyes closed , and in repose he looked dead . I could hardly believe that this was my vibrant action-hero pal of yore . Surreptitiously , I called Lil 's phone . " I 'm bringing him home , " I subvocalized . " He 's in rough shape . Not sure what it 's all about . " " I 'll make up the couch , " she said . " And get some coffee together . Love you . " " Back atcha , kid , " I said . As we approached the tacky little swaybacked ranch house , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jules . " I waved him off . " No , really . I tried to think of who I could call , and you were the only one . I 've missed you , bud . " " Lil said she 'd put some coffee on , " I said . " You sound like you need it . " Lil was waiting on the sofa , a folded blanket and an extra pillow on the side table , a pot of coffee and some Disneyland Beijing mugs beside them . She stood and extended her hand . " I 'm Lil , " she said . " Dan , " he said . " It 's a pleasure . " I knew she was pinging his Whuffie and I caught her look of surprised disapproval . Us oldsters who predate Whuffie know that it 's important ; but to the kids , it 's the world . Someone without any is automatically suspect . I watched her recover quickly , smile , and surreptitiously wipe her hand on her jeans . " Coffee ? " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the sofa . She poured him a cup and set it on a coaster on the coffee table . " I 'll let you boys catch up , then , " she said , and started for the bedroom . " No , " Dan said . " Wait . If you do n't mind . I think it 'd help if I could talk to someone ... younger , too . " She set her face in the look of chirpy helpfulness that all the second-gen castmembers have at their instant disposal , and settled into an armchair . She pulled out her pipe and lit a rock . I went through my crack period before she was born , just after they made it decaf , and I always felt old when I saw her and her friends light up . Dan surprised me by holding out a hand to her and taking the pipe . He toked heavily , then passed it back . Dan closed his eyes again , then ground his fists into them , sipped his coffee . It was clear he was trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I was braver than I really am , is what it boils down to , " he said . " Who does n't ? " I said . " I really thought I could do it . I knew that someday I 'd run out of things to do , things to see . I knew that I 'd finish some day . You remember , we used to argue about it . I swore I 'd be done , and that would be the end of it . And now I am . There is n't a single place left on-world that is n't part of the Bitchun Society . There is n't a single thing left that I want any part of . " " So deadhead for a few centuries , " I said . " Put the decision off . " " No ! " he shouted , startling both of us . " I 'm done . It 's over . " " So do it , " Lil said . " I ca n't , " he sobbed , and buried his face in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great , snoring sobs that shook his whole body . Lil went into the kitchen and got some tissue , and passed it to me . I sat alongside him and awkwardly patted his back . " Jesus , " he said , into his palms . " Jesus . " " Dan ? " I said , quietly . He sat up and took the tissue , wiped off his face and hands . " Thanks , " he said . " I 've tried to make a go of it , really I have . I 've spent the last eight years in Istanbul , writing papers on my missions , about the communities . I did some followup studies , interviews . No one was interested . Not even me . I smoked a lot of hash . It did n't help . So , one morning I woke up and went to the bazaar and said good-bye to the friends I 'd made there . Then I went to a pharmacy and had the man make me up a lethal injection . He wished me good luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there with the hypo all afternoon , then I decided to sleep on it , and I got up the next morning and did it all over again . I looked inside myself , and I saw that I did n't have the guts . I just did n't have the guts . I 've stared down the barrels of a hundred guns , had a thousand knives pressed up against my throat , but I did n't have the guts to press that button . " " You were too late , " Lil said . We both turned to look at her . " You were a decade too late . Look at you . You 're pathetic . If you killed yourself right now , you 'd just be a washed-up loser who could n't hack it . If you 'd done it ten years earlier , you would 've been going out on top-a champion , retiring permanently . " She set her mug down with a harder-than-necessary clunk . Sometimes , Lil and I are right on the same wavelength . Sometimes , it 's like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do was sit there , horrified , and she was happy to discuss the timing of my pal 's suicide . But she was right . Dan nodded heavily , and I saw that he knew it , too . " A day late and a dollar short , " he sighed . " Well , do n't just sit there , " she said . " You know what you 've got to do . " " What ? " I said , involuntarily irritated by her tone . She looked at me like I was being deliberately stupid . " He 's got to get back on top . Cleaned up , dried out , into some productive work . Get that Whuffie up , too . Then he can kill himself with dignity . " It was the stupidest thing I 'd ever heard . Dan , though , was cocking an eyebrow at her and thinking hard . " How old did you say you were ? " he asked . " Twenty-three , " she said . " Wish I 'd had your smarts at twenty-three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straightening up . " Can I stay here while I get the job done ? " I looked askance at Lil , who considered for a moment , then nodded . " Sure , pal , sure , " I said . I clapped him on the shoulder . " You look beat . " " Beat does n't begin to cover it , " he said . " Good night , then , " I said . Chapter Two Ad-hocracy works well , for the most part . Lil 's folks had taken over the running of Liberty Square with a group of other interested , compatible souls . They did a fine job , racked up gobs of Whuffie , and anyone who came around and tried to take it over would be so reviled by the guests they would n't find a pot to piss in . Or they 'd have such a wicked , radical approach that they 'd ouster Lil 's parents and their pals , and do a better job . It can break down , though . There were pretenders to the throne-a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved off to other pursuits-some of them had gone to school , some of them had made movies , written books , or gone off to Disneyland Beijing to help start things up . A few had deadheaded for a couple decades . They came back to Liberty Square with a message : update the attractions . The Liberty Square ad-hocs were the staunchest conservatives in the Magic Kingdom , preserving the wheezing technology in the face of a Park that changed almost daily . The newcomer/ old-timers were on-side with the rest of the Park , had their support , and looked like they might make a successful go of it . So it fell to Lil to make sure that there were no bugs in the meager attractions of Liberty Square : the Hall of the Presidents , the Liberty Belle riverboat , and the glorious Haunted Mansion , arguably the coolest attraction to come from the fevered minds of the old-time Disney Imagineers . I caught her backstage at the Hall of the Presidents , tinkering with Lincoln II , the backup animatronic . Lil tried to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She could swap out a dead hot for a backup in five minutes flat , which is all that crowd-control would permit . It had been two weeks since Dan 's arrival , and though I 'd barely seen him in that time , his presence was vivid in our lives . Our little ranch-house had a new smell , not unpleasant , of rejuve and hope and loss , something barely noticeable over the tropical flowers nodding in front of our porch . My phone rang three or four times a day , Dan checking in from his rounds of the Park , seeking out some way to accumulate personal capital . His excitement and dedication to the task were inspiring , pulling me into his **35;740;TOOLONG mode of being . " You just missed Dan , " she said . She had her head in Lincoln 's chest , working with an autosolder and a magnifier . Bent over , red hair tied back in a neat bun , sweat sheening her wiry freckled arms , smelling of girl-sweat and machine lubricant , she made me wish there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her behind affectionately , and she wriggled appreciatively . " He 's looking better . " His rejuve had taken him back to apparent twenty-five , the way I remembered him . He was rawboned and leathery , but still had the defeated stoop that had startled me when I saw him at the Adventurer 's Club . " What did he want ? " " He 's been hanging out with Debra-he wanted to make sure I knew what she 's up to . " Debra was one of the old guard , a former comrade of Lil 's parents . She 'd spent a decade in Disneyland Beijing , coding sim-rides . If she had her way , we 'd tear down every marvelous Rube Goldberg in the Park and replace them with pristine white sim boxes on giant , articulated servos . The problem was that she was really good at coding sims . Continues ...
