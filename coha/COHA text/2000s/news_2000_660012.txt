<p> Their eyes are glazed . They sit in the shadow , dozens of men and women , waiting for what will happen next . Some men shuffle stiffly in circles , straightened by steel corsets that support their injured spines , Band-Aids cover their bruised foreheads . Women cradle their children . A little girl sits in the dirt , playing with an empty box of cigarettes . They literally wash ashore almost every night on Italy 's southern Adriatic coast : Kurds , Kosovar Albanians , Afghans , Ethiopians , and lately , Chinese . Those who are caught by the Guardia di Finanza , the Italian police , end up at the Casa Regina Pacis , a refugee center at the far end of this wind-swept fishing village . Albania 's people smugglers say they are providing a service to these refugees . And , they like to point out , nobody forces them onto their speedboats . But do n't use that line on Don Cesare Lodeserto , the director of the center . " Look at the faces of these people , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women outside his window , " and then tell me if these are the faces of people who have been taken here by good Samaritans . " Don Cesare , as everyone here respectfully calls him , is a burly man with a round , bald head and thick hands . He has seen too much hurt to be diplomatic in his assessment of the smugglers . " People get killed , " he says . " They get on these boats with no life vests and babies in their arms . They pay outrageous amounts of money , and nobody tells them about the danger . " Wittingly or not , the volume of refugees risking their lives to escape poverty or persecution at home is staggering . In just the first 10 months of this year , Italian security forces report intercepting 21,000 people in the 42-mile wide channel between Otranto , Italy , and Albania . For Americans , a comparison of scale would be the flood of 30,000 Cuban " boat-people , " who fled across the Caribbean in 1994 . Last year in Italy , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kosovo ) , up from 7,100 in 1998 . Kosovars have the right to claim political asylum if they can get here . For many other illegal immigrants , Italy is a convenient stepping stone to other parts of Western Europe , where jobs and relatives are waiting . In fact , the Italian and Albanian mafias originally set up the networks to smuggle drugs , guns , and prostitutes into Italy . For some time now , the bulk of the business involves moving people . Most of those who arrive here at the refugee compound will be returned to the countries and the lives they tried to leave behind . Last year , Italy expelled 65,000 people . A few will be granted political asylum . But it has become increasingly difficult for refugees to establish a " well-founded fear " for their lives in their home countries . It helps to be a Kurd from Iraq , a " rogue state " with a despised leader . It is a different story for a Kurd from Turkey , an important NATO ally . Amiel Daniel Yako understands the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . The young man with jet-black hair and dark-brown eyes now works as one of Don Cesare 's assistants . But he came here just the way they did , on a speedboat from Vlore , after what seemed to him a never-ending odyssey from Iraq . He started in Baghdad , where he left a father who Mr. Amiel says was often harassed by the security police because of his Kurdish roots and his underground work for Kurdish autonomy . Friends helped Amiel to cross into Turkey , where he set out for Istanbul , the main hub for immigrant smugglers in the region . He had heard that the place to find a smuggler was the Hotel Kaskul , and he did . There he paid $ 6,000 for a fake Iraqi passport and a promise to be taken to Italy . A few days later , Amiel was sitting among 30 other Kurdish refugees in the back of a truck en route to Bulgaria . They drove for two days and two nights . In Bulgaria , they waited for five days in a house without furniture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ border guards were bribed , Amiel says . A day later they finally arrived in Vlore , but the Adriatic Sea was too rough for the speedboats to cross , and again they had to wait for days in an empty house with little food . " For 20 days we lived on nothing but cheese , " Amiel recalls . " We cut it with a knife and ate it in big chunks . We had to pay the smugglers for it , and they did n't even give us bread . " But the worst part of the journey lay ahead . He had been pushed and slapped before , Amiel says , but the smugglers in Vlore beat him with a stick . He touches his head , neck , calves , and ankles to show where they hit him . His head injuries were so severe , he says , that after his arrival in Otranto he had to stay at a hospital for three days . " They were ruthless , " Amiel says . The smugglers demanded another $ 500 for the crossing and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ring , and all the money he had left . And then they gave him a beating . When Amiel and the other Kurds finally boarded the speedboats in Vlore one night , they had to curl on the floor in fetal positions , with no space to stretch or move . " Like animals , " he says and presses his arms against his chest to show how the refugees cowered next to each other . There was a skipper and a lookout with binoculars and a cellphone , he says . They gunned the boat full speed , without lights , through the darkness . Amiel opens his right hand and repeatedly slaps it on the back of his left hand to show the enormity of the impact each time the boat hit the waves . He vividly remembers the moment when he first saw the lights of Otranto . " I prayed and thanked God , " he says , and then he folds his hands as if in a prayer and raises his head and looks at the sky . But in the final moments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragedy struck . When they approached the shore , the skipper ordered the refugees to jump in the water and swim . He threw their plastic bags after them , turned the boat around and vanished . " There were about 10 children and one woman who could n't swim , " Amiel says . " We were able to help the children , but the woman drowned . " And when they finally made it to the shore , the Italian police were waiting for them . For many , the hope of a life less painful ended on the very shore they had given all their money and all their strength to reach . Amiel was granted asylum , but many of the others were sent back . There are scars on his chin and his wrists , and only after being asked about them does he tell the whole story of his flight from Iraq . The Iraqi security police wanted him to work as an informer , he says , and they already had a target for him - his father . When he refused to cooperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , and then they slashed his chin and wrists . He knew then that it was time to go , and he fled to Turkey . That was more than a year ago , and he has n't yet been able to contact his parents . He knows that to hear from him would put them in danger . And he knows that as long as the Saddam Hussein regime is in power , he will not be able to go back . Amiel is safe now , and he doubts that he would have made it to Italy without the help of the smugglers . But he would never do it again , he says , and he is not grateful . " They live off our misery , " he says . " They know we have no choice . " Amiel hopes to find a job as a mechanic soon , and he longs for a peaceful life in Italy , even though he knows it will never be complete without his parents . He now wears his baseball hat backwards and runs around in Adidas sneakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memories , he took a new name . He now calls himself Johnny . Italy 's long coast is almost impossible to control adequately , and the government has called for greater international coordination to combat the traffic . " We are facing one of the most dangerous organized crime networks operating in the Mediterranean , " Italian Interior Minister Enzo Bianco said last week . Italy wants the European Union to establish its own police force . " Europe must understand that its external frontiers do not belong just to national states , but to the whole European Union , " said Mr. Bianco . Germany and Italy recently agreed to an exchange of police officers in border areas . Bianco is working on similar agreements with Spain and Britain . Meanwhile , the smugglers continue to elude the authorities , and refugees continue to drown . " Our first priority is to save lives , " says Lt. Paolo Soro , a section chief for naval operations at the Guardia di Finanza in Otranto . " That is why we wait for the smugglers to drop off their passengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrested skippers as young as 15 , Lieutenant Soro says , and these young men resort to extremely dangerous maneuvers when pursued by Italian patrol boats . Often they manage to escape because they know that the police will try to avoid collisions . " They have no shame and no fear , " Soro says . " Sometimes they make people jump out of their boats 300 feet offshore . Many of the refugees ca n't swim , and they are still cold and sore when they jump in the water . " The sea between Otranto and Vlore is narrow , and the lighthouse at the Cape of Otranto is a good point of reference for the speedboats , says Soro . And when it comes to the smuggling business , the Albanian and the Italian mafias work together well , he adds . Italian informers are positioned along the coast and guide the skippers of the speedboats with cellphones . The Italian authorities have a radar station on the Albanian island of Sazan . They see the speedboats leaving Vlore , but there is nothing they can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a routine , " Soro says in frustration . " It 's the same story every night . " The question of how to curb the trade is a contentious issue between the authorities on both sides of the Adriatic . The Albanians complain about condescending , colonial-style behavior by the Italians . The Italians accuse the Albanians of inaction . " The problem is that the Albanian government ca n't control this problem , " Soro says . Asked if he is trying to imply that the Albanian government does n't want to control the problem , Soro sheepishly smiles . " That 's not my problem , " he says and shrugs . " That 's a political problem . " On Tuesday , Rome praised the fact that a new law enacted two weeks ago has enabled the Albanians to seize 15 speedboats used by smugglers . At the refugee center , Don Cesare deals with the problem in his own way . Every night , when the smugglers in Vlore prepare their speedboats on the opposite coast of the Adriatic , he opens the gate to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There they stand on the rocks in a circle , facing the sea they crossed . As the night falls , soaking the sea in darkness , Don Cesare , glowing in his white gown , raises his arms and begins to pray . The refugees speak after him , their eyes fixed on the water reflecting the orange lights of the village . Their faces look serene , as if illuminated by a flicker of hope . But as they 're moving their lips , some closing their eyes , there is no way to tell if they are thanking God that they made it here safely or if they 're asking Him not to send them back .
