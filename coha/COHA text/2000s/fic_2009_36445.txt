Carlos <br> " Give me your hand . " <br> It was dark in the bar , the air thick with cigarette smoke and the salt stink of pisco and perspiration , but he could see that she was as lovely as she had seemed from across the room . She was standing with one hand outstretched . Her hair was long , black , heavy ; her teeth white and straight behind the radiant smile . <br> " Come . You 've been staring at me long enough . You want to dance ? " <br> He felt the fever of the evening 's accumulated drink make a slow , pleasant course for his brain . His friends were laughing , slapping the hard oak with their hands . Someone shouted , " Bluhm ! She wants to see you move ! Go on ! Give her something to look at ! " <br> They had come from the Club Germania , the venerable establishment on the outskirts of the capital where they had spent a quiet evening with their wives , plying them with pork chops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy matrons to Oscar 's sleek black Mercedes , they had instructed his chauffeur to take them to a nearby parlor for ice cream . The men would go off to Las Americas for brandy and cigars . <br> But it was n't to Las Americas that they had gone . Willy , who had long been carrying on with a woman in San Borja , had a better idea . There was a place not far from Carmela 's apartment , he told them  --  Noches Lindas . Good bolero , fresh Havanas , pretty women . <br> Willy being Willy , his description was wrong on most counts : It was tango , not bolero . The cigars were stale . The sign over the door read Noches Limenas  --  Lima Nights . But the women were reasonably good looking , the only exception a toothy mestiza with orange hair . <br> They had taken a table a good distance from the dance floor so that they could survey the lot . Clearly , some of the women had come with men  --  or would be leaving with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stroking their hair , nuzzling their necks . The ones with red collars were employees of the bar , the waiter explained , and available as dance partners . All you had to do was wiggle a finger . <br> Marco , a genial hotel manager and ever the catalyst where women were concerned , had been the first to call one over . She was delicate as a bird  --  tiny and freckled  --  pale for a Negro , hair bleached the color of wheat . " Why her ? " Willy barked , as she made her way to their table . <br> " Why do you think ? " Marco barked back over the loud music . " She looks German ! A bit more nose , a bit less lip , and she could be my cousin Hilda . " <br> They laughed and watched him go off , the three of them content to sit and take in the liquor . <br> It was true Bluhm had been ogling the one with long dark hair . There was , after all , the matter of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red frill along the hem . Slit to one hip , it clung to her , so that there was no mystery about the curve of her breasts or the sweet little shape of her ass . It was the dress that got his attention . Then came the rest : The nut-brown skin , smooth , dusted here and there with gold glitter . The angel face , the scarlet pout of her lips . And , finally , the red velvet ribbon that circled her neck , signaling her status as an available partner . <br> The loud , fluttering wail of the bandoneon drowned out the men 's voices , but he no longer cared what they were saying . With an impish grin , Bluhm beckoned the woman closer . She leaned in . " I do n't do the tango , " he said . <br> " Sure you do , " she countered , her voice resolute and deep . " You just have n't tried . And no one has taught you . " <br> He could smell her perfume at that distance : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apple ? Quince ? He could n't tell . But fruit it emphatically was , the kind of fragrance his wife had never favored , preferring as she did the subtle , warm scent of tuberoses . Earlier that evening , kissing their sons good night , Sophie had swept a silk scarf over her shoulders and filled the room with the redolence of those diminutive white flowers . Even out in the vestibule he 'd noted it . It was an aptitude he 'd always had  --  that strong , indisputable sense of smell . Totally useless for an importer of cameras . <br> " Go on , Carlos ! " His friends were pounding the table with fists now . " Do n't disappoint the lady ! " Lady . They knew all too well he had an appetite for cholas  --  the browner the better . But he would n't have called any one of his conquests a lady . <br> Maybe it was the scent of their skin  --  the sharp bouquet of it , as natural and welcoming as loam . Or the small hands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cunning tilt of their eyes . All of it so different from , so antithetical to Bluhm , whose hands were large , skin like milk , eyes blue . Or Bluhm 's wife , for that matter . <br> In all his forty-four years , he had never known anyone who looked less Peruvian than Sophie . She , like Bluhm , had been raised entirely in Spanish , on Creole food , in the heart of the Inca continent . But , like him , she was fair and blond , a real Teuton . The years had been kind to Sophie  --  she still had her slender figure , hair the color of a German autumn  --  but time had sharpened her features , hardened her jaw . Since the birth of Rudy sixteen years ago , her lips , which always had been daintily bowed , had settled into a grim line . Eventually , a certain severity  --  a Berliner elegance , his mother called it  --  had taken command of her face . <br> He stood and let the woman lead him to the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black mane with all the vigor of an eager pony . There was something exhilarating about her . Wild . The bandoneon was at full throttle now , and the player was pumping his long arms , sending quick fingers across the buttons . A fat man in an ill-fitting suit crooned , " Te ha-a-a entrado muy adentro en el pobre cora-a-azon ! " <br> The chola took his hands and began a simple two-step , as if she were teaching a slow child . It was easy to follow . In the distance , he could see Marco twirling the yellow-haired Negress under one arm . Bluhm could n't help but laugh , and his partner laughed with him . She placed Bluhm 's right hand firmly against the small of her back and held it there as she looked up triumphantly . " See ? " she said . " This is the tango . You 've mastered the first lesson . " <br> They finished the dance and he and his friends left shortly afterward . He thought little more of the woman in the tight black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark of his bedroom . Reaching into a pocket to fish out his keys , he felt an unfamiliar bit of paper , no larger than a business card . By the light of the bathroom , he read : <br> Juana Maria Fernandez <br> For Your Next Lesson , call : 466-0777 . <br> The next time he saw her was at Santa Isabel , the fancy new Chilean-owned supermarket on the Avenida Camino Real . He was with his son , wheeling along a cart filled with ingredients for pilsner , which he liked to make in the comfort of his own kitchen . He turned the corner and there she was , standing to one side of a cash register , moving someone 's groceries efficiently off the conveyor belt into bags . <br> He did n't recognize her immediately , although he was drawn to the face . Her hair was pulled into a tidy knot at the nape of her neck and she wore no lipstick , but , as she chatted with the cashier animatedly , the unmistakable loveliness was there and , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruity perfume , and the drunken night  --  two weeks before  --  when a woman with the same face had led him to the dance floor . <br> " Here , Fritz , " he said to his son before he could think better of it , " let 's get in line over here . " <br> " Why ? " the lanky nineteen-year-old protested . " That register there has fewer people ! " Fritz was too tall for his trousers , disheveled , a halo of amber curls framing his face , and he spoke with a young person 's certitude that grown-ups were inferior creatures . Seeing his father move in the opposite direction , he sighed and slouched along like an obliging dog . <br> The woman computed the situation immediately . She had seen Bluhm standing in line , inching his way toward her . By the time the cashier was ready to check him through , she had calculated that the boy was his son , the groceries were for his wife , and , more than likely , the store they were standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Good to see you , sir . " <br> The voice was strong and thrilling , full of welcome  --  hinting at all the ways a woman might please a man . He remembered hearing that voice in the din of the tango bar . <br> " You work here now ? " <br> She looked up from under her thick eyelashes . " I work here too . " <br> Fritz straightened to his full height and looked from his father 's face to hers and back again with quick curiosity . <br> " In both places ! Really ? And when do you ever sleep ? " Bluhm reached casually for his wallet , enjoying the secrets in that very public conversation . <br> She laughed and pulled the six gallons of distilled water , four packets of yeast , and jar of malt syrup from the aluminum table into plastic bags , working her small hands nimbly . The cashier , deprived now of her sunny attention , punched the register 's buttons glumly and kept to himself . <br> " So , this is your son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fritz . Come on , Fritz , be polite , say hello to . . . Juana ? " <br> " Maria . I go by my middle name . " <br> " Ah . " Then , turning to Fritz , " Maria also works in a restaurant in San Borja . She 's waited on me there . She 's a friend . " <br> Fritz nodded , understanding the clear exaggeration of the word , the grace of it  --  men of his father 's class were not friends to waitresses . He said hello dutifully and , his curiosity satisfied , shuffled off to look at wristwatches on a faraway counter . <br> Bluhm studied the young woman more closely now , trying to square the demure vision before him with the voluptuous bargirl he had held briefly in his arms . She looked to be in her twenties  --  round face , a doll 's chin , small nose , more jungle than mountain Indian  --  and , in the full light of day , he could see that her complexion was smooth and perfect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a paradox too : In the full light of day , she seemed straightforward , guileless  --  not at all the sort of woman who would slip her number into a stranger 's coat . <br> " You never came back for your second lesson , " she said , pushing the reloaded cart toward him . <br> " No , " he said , and winked at her openly . " But do n't give up on me yet , sweetheart . I 'm not as slow-footed as I seem . " <br> Bluhm chatted idly with his son as he pulled the old black car past the open gate into the driveway of 300 Avenida Rivera . He did n't have to step foot inside his house to know that Sophie was at the piano and Rudy in the straight-backed chair at her side . The boy was playing his cello  --  he was better than good at it  --  and the sad , plangent strains of Bach 's " Erbarme Dich " rode out of the house 's elaborate windows into the bright November afternoon . <br> Bluhm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat in the car a few minutes longer , allowing the music to fill his senses . It was a piece his father had played on that same cello every Sunday , after the siesta  --  a poignant prayer set to music . Every weekend of Bluhm 's childhood , for as long as he could remember , he had wakened to that inexpressibly mournful melody , and now here was his younger son , rendering it beautifully , echoing a past he had never known . <br> Bluhm closed his eyes and breathed in the sweetness of his garden . He could smell the bougainvillea cascading down the wall , the peach trees thrusting their fleecy new progeny into spring , the hosta lilies , like so many soldiers , lining the walk in triumphant welcome . He caught the scent of his mother 's lilacs , arching over the double doors and tumbling down along the latticework . She had planted them herself , well before his father had died , well before Bluhm and Sophie had moved in  --  when 300 Avenida Rivera had hummed with servants and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when German bankers from Stuttgart stood out on the veranda , taking in the night 's fragrance and stars . <br> The house was still grand . No one could deny it . Nestled between the Golf Club and the ancient pyramids , it sat at the very heart of San Isidro  --  in a neighborhood whose shops sported French names and catered to women with haughty faces . The streets here were clean , hosed down by gardeners every morning ; the walls freshly painted every spring . Standing guard in the magnificent doorways of the commercial establishments were armed sentries in handsome uniforms , whose only apparent charge was to shoo off the beggars who stumbled in now and then from the heartbreaking dunghills of Lima . <br> Bluhm 's house stood on as a tribute to the family affluence , even if that affluence was now largely gone . It had stood through the First World War , when Carlos 's grandfather Johann Bluhm had been drafted along with hundreds of other Latin Americans of German origin to serve in the kaiser 's army . It had stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embassy had come around , sat under the house 's vaulted ceilings , drunk schnapps , and insisted , to no avail , that Johann 's son , Rodolfo , do the right thing and join the Wehrmacht . It had stood on through the boom days of the ' 50s , when Rodolfo was made head representative of the Deutsche Bank in Lima ; when he and his wife , Dorotea , left little Carlos to roam its vast halls with four nursemaids , a butler , and three cooks , while they toured the world on the Queen Elizabeth . It stood on in the early ' 70s when the socialists parceled out the rural haciendas of the rich to the peons ; when Dorotea , by then a widow , shuttered her windows against anyone with a possible eye for the family silver . And it was standing now , in this nervous decade of terrorism , in a country festooned with barbed wire and bedeviled by random violence . It was standing fast , even though Carlos Bluhm was no banker but an ordinary , run-of-the-mill camera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a postlapsarian limbo and its unfinished buildings and bridges hung like mastodons in midair , half born , and waiting for issue . <br> Continues ...
