There are people who attend karate exhibitions to marvel at the discipline and focus that the sport demands of its participants , and the ritualism that evokes hundreds of years of history . Then there is karate master Kazuyoshi Ishii , who just likes watching people get their teeth knocked out . <P> Ishii created the K-1 Grand Prix , an ultimate fighting tournament in which expert practitioners of such disciplines as karate , kick boxing , kung fu , kempo , kakutogi and tae kwon do duke it out to determine which " K " martial art reigns supreme . It 's a lot like Iron Chef , with humans taking the pounding as opposed to the veal cutlets . <P> A founder of the famed Seido Kaikan karate school in Osaka , Japan , Ishii , 48 , has respect for the aesthetic and ascetic virtues of the martial arts . It 's just that he prefers the martial to the arts , and he believes spectators do too . " To increase the popularity and visibility of karate , we need to professionalize it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I want to make K-1 as popular worldwide as F1 Formula One . " <P> He 's on his way . As a promoter Ishii puts Don King to shame , selling out every event he has ever held , including last year 's championship in the 55,000-seat Tokyo Dome . In Japan , K-1 fighters like world champion Ernest Hoost , a 6-ft. 5-in. , 220-lb . Muay Thai kick-boxing expert from Holland , enjoy rock-star status . The sport is also gaining audiences in Europe and in the U.S. A recent event at the Bellagio Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas kept Ishii 's sellout streak alive , and a new PlayStation game is bound to hook any American kid who just might happen to enjoy animated pummeling . <P> Beyond blood , the appeal of the Grand Prix lies in its king-of-the-hill simplicity . Sixteen fighters square off in a bracket-style tournament . There 's only one division  --  heavyweight  --  and the champion must survive several brutal bouts in a single day . Whatever patina of class and skill the martial arts lend to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Cheech levels of smoke . Ubiquitous ring announcer Michael Buffer has already collected a K-1 appearance fee . <P> For karate-tournament purists , accustomed to the elaborate formality of participants and a code that discourages cheering , K-1 is an abomination . Says Ishii : " I 'm proud of that . " <P>  --  By Josh Tyrangiel , with reporting by Hiroko Tashiro/Tokyo
