TOMMY FRANKS <P> Could you stare this man down ? General Franks is the officer in charge at U.S. Central Command , the nerve center for American military operations in 25 countries in Asia , Africa and the Middle East . That means he is responsible for running the war in Afghanistan , and , if it comes to that , he will be giving orders in Iraq . Franks has taken flak for wanting to wage war the old-fashioned way . But no one questions the strength of his resolve . <P> CHIEF CHARLES MOOSE <P> The situation called for subtlety , smarts and swiftness , and for a few days people wondered whether a man named Moose was the right person for the task . But with all eyes on him , the Montgomery County , Md. , police chief led some 1,000 investigators in a 22-day manhunt for the snipers who haunted Washington 's suburbs . In the end , he got the duo believed to be the shooters , and America got a new hero . <P> HANS BLIX <P> Those impassive eyes do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like your grandfather 's accountant , but the affable Swede , who heads the U.N . weapons-inspection team in Iraq , is now the eyes of the world , which is counting on him to find out what Saddam has up his sleeve . Blix knows , however , that what you see is n't always what you get . <P> NANCY PELOSI <P> The first woman to be elected party leader in either house of Congress , Pelosi has practical experience in doing the impossible . She will need it for her next assignment : an unapologetic liberal , she must bring unity and direction to a Democratic Party still smarting from its midterm spanking . As the daughter of an old-school Baltimore , Md. , ward boss , Pelosi might just be the woman for the job . <P> SERENA WILLIAMS <P> When 2002 began , there were only two players in women 's tennis who mattered : Venus and Serena Williams . Now there 's only one . Serena took the last three Grand Slam events of the year , besting her older sister in all three , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the Tiger of tennis  --  and she has the cat suits to prove it . <P> BISHOP WILTON D. GREGORY <P> A rising star in a year of fallen priests , Bishop Gregory led the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops in drafting a new , tougher policy to deal with clergy accused of sexual abuse . In December the Vatican approved it , albeit in modified form , but the heartbreak and the lawsuits will continue , and Gregory , whose home diocese is Belleville , Ill. , must pray for guidance on the difficult road ahead . <P> PERVEZ MUSHARRAF <P> How 's this for a balancing act ? In 2002 Pakistan 's President cooperated with America 's war on terrorism while mollifying his fundamentalist Muslim subjects . He reasserted Pakistan 's claims to Kashmir while avoiding an all-out war with India . Washington can only hope the act lasts a long time ; if Musharraf were to go , there would always be the chance a hard-line Islamic radical could rule a nuclear-tipped Pakistan . <P> ARIEL SHARON           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
