THE EKUMEN Ursula K. Le Guin Rocannon 's World ( 1966 ) Planet of Exile ( 1966 ) City of Illusions ( 1967 ) The Left Hand of Darkness ( 1969 ) The Dispossessed ( 1974 ) The Word for World is Forest ( 1976 ) Four Ways to Forgiveness ( 1995 ) Most of my science fiction takes place within one future-historical frame . As this developed haphazardly along with the books and stories , it contains some spectacular inconsistencies , but the general plan is this : The people of a world called Hain colonized the entire Orion Arm of the galaxy over a million years ago . All hominid species so far encountered are descendants of Hainish colonists ( often genetically tailored to fit the colony planet or for other reasons ) . After this Expansion , the Hainish withdrew to Hain for hundreds of millennia , leaving their far-flung offspring to hack it . When Earth people began to explore nearby space , using Nearly As Fast As Light ( NAFAL ) ships and the instantaneous communicator called the ansible , they met up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lost kinfolk . A League of Worlds was formed ( see the novels Rocannon 's Word , Planet of Exile , City of Illusions ) . This expanded and matured into an egalitarian association of worlds and people called the Ekumen , administered from Hain by people called Stabiles , while Mobiles went out to explore unknown worlds , find out about new peoples , and serve as envoys and ambassadors to member worlds . The " Ekumenical " novels are : The Left Hand of Darkness , The Word for World is Forest , and The Dispossessed . Most of the science-fiction stories in the collections The Wind 's Twelve Quarters and The Compass Rose , the last three stories in A Fisherman of the Inland Sea , and all in Four Ways to Forgiveness , are set in the Ekumen . This last book introduced the planets Werel and Yeowe . On Werel , thirty-five hundred years ago , an aggressive black-skinned people dominated the paler northern races and instituted a slave-based society and economy , with caste established by skin color . First contact by the Ekumen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spaceships , and incidentally into colonizing Yeowe , the planet next inward to their sun , which they exploited with intensive slave labor . Soon after Werel finally admitted diplomats from the Ekumen , a great slave uprising began on Yeowe . After thirty years of war , Yeowe won its freedom from the dominant nation on Werel , Voe Deo . Voe Dean society was destabilized by the Yeowan liberation , as well as by the new perspectives offered by the Ekumen . Within a few years , a widespread slave uprising in Voe Deo pitted " owners " against " assets " in a full-scale civil war . This story takes place late in that war . Ursula K. Le Guin Old Music and the Slave Women by Ursula K. Le Guin The Chief Intelligence Officer of the Ekumenical Embassy to Werel , as man who on his home world had the name Sohikelwenyanmurkeres Esdan , and who in Voe Deo was known by a nickname , Esdardon Aya or Old Music , was bored . It had taken a civil war and three years to bore him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself in ansible reports to the Stabiles on Hain as the Embassy 's chief stupidity officer . He had been able , however , to retain a few clandestine links with friends in the Free City even after the Legitimate Government sealed the Embassy , allowing no one and no information to enter or leave it . In the third summer of the war , he came to the Ambassador with a request . Cut off from reliable communication with the Embassy , Liberation Command had asked him ( how ? asked the Ambassador ; through one of the men who delivered groceries , he explained ) if the Embassy would let one or two of its people slip across the lines and talk with them , be seen with them , offer proof that despite propaganda and disinformation , and though the Embassy was stuck in Jit City , its staff had not been co-opted into supporting the Legitimates , but remained neutral and ready to deal with rightful authority on either side . " Jit City ? " said the Ambassador . " Never mind . But how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Utopia , " Esdan said . " Well , I can pass with contact lenses , if nobody 's looking closely . Crossing the Divide is the tricky bit . " Most of the great city was still physically there , the government buildings , factories and warehouses , the university , the tourist attractions : the Great Shrine of Tual , Theater Street , the Old Market with its interesting display rooms and lofty Hall of Auction , disused since the sale and rental of assets had been shifted to the electronic marketplace ; the numberless streets , avenues , and boulevards , the dusty parks shaded by purple-flowered beya trees , the miles and miles of shops , sheds , mills , tracks , stations , apartment buildings , houses , compounds , the neighborhoods , the suburbs , and exurbs . Most of it still stood , most of its fifteen million people were still there , but its deep complexity was gone . Connections were broken . Interactions did not take place . A brain after a stroke . The greatest break was a brutal one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no-man's-land of blown-up buildings and blocked streets , wreckage and rubble . East of the Divide was Legitimate territory : downtown , government offices , embassies , banks , communications towers , the university , the great parks and wealthy neighborhoods , the roads out to the armory , barracks , airports , and spaceport . West of the Divide was Free City , Dustyville , Liberation territory : factories , union compounds , the rentspeople 's quarters , the old gareot residential neighborhoods , endless miles of little streets petering out into the plains at last . Through both ran the great East-West highways , empty . The Liberation people smuggled him out of the Embassy and almost across the Divide successfully . He and they had had a lot of practice in the old days getting runaway assets out to Yeowe and freedom . He found it interesting to be the one smuggled instead of one of the smugglers , finding it far more frightening yet less stressful , since he was not responsible , the package not the postman . But somewhere in the connection there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Divide and partway through it and stopped at a little derelict truck sitting on its wheel rims under a gutted apartment house . A driver sat at the wheel behind the cracked , crazed windshield , and grinned at him . His guide gestured him into the back . The truck took off like a hunting cat , following a crazy route , zigzagging through the ruins . They were nearly across the Divide , jolting across a rubbled stretch which might have been a street or a marketplace , when the truck veered , stopped , there were shouts , shots , the van back was flung open and men plunged in at him . " Easy , " he said , " go easy , " for they were manhandling him , hauling him , twisting his arm behind his back . They yanked him out of the truck , pulled off his coat and slapped him down searching for weapons , frog-marched him to a car waiting beside the truck . He tried to see if his driver was dead but could not look around before they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government state-coach , dark red , wide , and long , made for parades , for carrying great estate owners to the Council and ambassadors from the spaceport . Its main section could be curtained to separate men from women passengers , and the driver 's compartment was sealed off so the passengers would n't be breathing in what a slave breathed out . One of the men had kept his arm twisted up his back until he shoved him headfirst into the car , and all he thought as he found himself sitting between two men and facing three others and the car starting up was , I 'm getting too old for this . He held still , letting his fear and pain subside , not ready yet to move even to rub his sharply hurting shoulder , not looking into faces nor too obviously at the streets . Two glances told him they were passing Rei Street , going east , out of the city . He realised then he had been hoping they were taking him back to the Embassy . What a fool . They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people on foot as they flashed by . Now they were on a wide boulevard , going very fast , still going east . Although he was in a very bad situation , he still found it absolutely exhilarating just to be out of the Embassy , out in the air , in the world , and moving , going fast . Cautiously he raised his hand and massaged his shoulder . As cautiously , he glanced at the men beside him and facing him . All were dark-skinned , two blue-black . Two of the men facing him were young . Fresh , stolid faces . The third was a veot of the third rank , an oga . His face had the quiet inexpressiveness in which his caste was trained . Looking at him , Esdan caught his eye . Each looked away instantly . Esdan liked veots . He saw them , soldiers as well as slaveholders , as part of the old Voe Deo , members of a doomed species . Businessmen and bureaucrats would survive and thrive in the Liberation and no doubt find soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . Their code of loyalty , honor , and austerity was too like that of their slaves , with whom they shared the worship of Kamye , the Swordsman , the Bondsman . How long would that mysticism of suffering survive the Liberation ? Veots were intransigent vestiges of an intolerable order . He trusted them , and had seldom been disappointed in his trust . The oga was very black , very handsome , like Teyeo , a veot Esdan had particularly liked . He had left Werel long before the war , off to Terra and Hain with his wife , who would be a Mobile of the Ekumen one of these days . In a few centuries . Long after the war was over , long after Esdan was dead . Unless he chose to follow them , went back , went home . Idle thoughts . During a revolution you do n't choose . You 're carried , a bubble in a cataract , a spark in a bonfire , an unarmed man in a car with seven armed men driving very fast down the broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city . Heading for the East Provinces . The Legitimate Government of Voe Deo was now reduced to half the capital city and two provinces , in which seven out of eight people were what the eighth person , their owner , called assets . The two men up in the front compartment were talking , though they could n't be heard in the owner compartment . Now the bullet-headed man to Esdan 's right asked a muttered question to the oga facing him , who nodded . " Oga , " Esdan said . The veot 's expressionless eyes met his . " I need to piss . " The man said nothing and looked away . None of them said anything for a while . They were on a bad stretch of the highway , torn up by fighting during the first summer of the Uprising or merely not maintained since . The jolts and shocks were hard on Esdan 's bladder . " Let the fucking white-eyes piss himself , " said one of the two young men facing him to the other , who smiled tightly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offensive , not provocative , and kept his mouth shut . They only wanted an excuse , those two . He closed his eyes and tried to relax , to be aware of the pain in his shoulder , the pain in his bladder , merely aware . The man to his left , whom he could not see clearly , spoke : " Driver . Pull off up there . " He used a speakerphone . The driver nodded . The car slowed , pulled off the road , jolting horribly . They all got out of the car . Esdan saw that the man to his left was also a veot , of the second rank , a zadyo . One of the young men grabbed Esdan 's arm as he got out , another shoved a gun against his liver . The others all stood on the dusty roadside and pissed variously on the dust , the gravel , the roots of a row of scruffy trees . Esdan managed to get his fly open but his legs were so cramped and shaky he could barely stand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now stood directly in front of him with the gun aimed at his penis . There was a knot of pain somewhere between his bladder and his cock . " Back up a little , " he said with plaintive irritability . " I do n't want to wet your shoes . " The young man stepped forward instead , bringing his gun right against Esdan 's groin . The zadyo made a slight gesture . The young man backed off a step . Esdan shuddered and suddenly pissed out a fountain . He was pleased , even in the agony of relief , to see he 'd driven the young man back two more steps . " Looks almost human , " the young man said . Esdan tucked his brown alien cock away with discreet promptness and slapped his trousers shut . He was still wearing lenses that hid the whites of his eyes , and was dressed as a rentsman in loose , coarse clothes of dull yellow , the only dye color that had been permitted to urban slaves . The banner of the Liberation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The body inside the clothes was the wrong color , too . Having lived on Werel for thirty-three years , Esdan was used to being feared and hated , but he had never before been entirely at the mercy of those who feared and hated him . The aegis of the Ekumen had sheltered him . What a fool , to leave the Embassy , where at least he 'd been harmless , and let himself be got hold of by these desperate defenders of a lost cause , who might do a good deal of harm not only to but with him . How much resistance , how much endurance , was he capable of ? Fortunately they could n't torture any information about Liberation plans from him , since he did n't know a damned thing about what his friends were doing . But still , what a fool . Back in the car , sandwiched in the seat with nothing to see but the young men 's scowls and the oga 's watchful nonexpression , he shut his eyes again . The highway was smooth here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postadrenaline doze . When he came fully awake the sky was gold , two of the little moons glittering above a cloudless sunset . They were jolting along on a side road , a driveway that wound past fields , orchards , plantations of trees and building-cane , a huge field-worker compound , more fields , another compound . They stopped at a checkpoint guarded by a single armed man , were checked briefly and waved through . The road went through an immense , open , rolling park . Its familiarity troubled him . Lacework of trees against the sky , the swing of the road among groves and glades . He knew the river was over that long hill . " This is Yaramera , " he said aloud . None of the men spoke . Years ago , decades ago , when he 'd been on Werel only a year or so , they 'd invited a party from the Embassy down to Yaramera , the greatest estate in Voe Deo . The Jewel of the East . The model of efficient slavery . Thousands of assets working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living in enormous compounds , walled towns . Everything clean , orderly , industrious , peaceful . And the house on the hill above the river , a palace , three hundred rooms , priceless furnishings , paintings , sculptures , musical instrumentshe remembered a private concert hall with walls of gold-backed glass mosaic , a Tualite shrine-room that was one huge flower carved of scented wood . They were driving up to that house now . The car turned . He caught only a glimpse , jagged black spars against the sky . The two young men were allowed to handle him again , haul him out of the car , twist his arm , push and shove him up the steps . Trying not to resist , not to feel what they were doing to him , he kept looking about him . The center and the south wing of the immense house were roofless , ruinous . Through the black outline of a window shone the blank clear yellow of the sky . Even here in the heartland of the Law , the slaves had risen . Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when thousands of houses had burned , compounds , towns , cities . Four million dead . He had not known the Uprising had reached even to Yaramera . No news came up the river . What toll among the Jewel 's slaves for that night of burning ? Had the owners been slaughtered , or had they survived to deal out punishment ? No news came up the river . All this went through his mind with unnatural rapidity and clarity as they crowded him up the shallow steps towards the north wing of the house , guarding him with drawn guns as if they thought a man of sixty-two with severe leg cramps from sitting motionless for hours was going to break and run for it , here , three hundred kilos inside their own territory . He thought fast and noticed everything . This part of the house , joined to the central house by a long arcade , had not burned down . The walls still bore up the roof , but he saw as they came into the front hall that they were bare stone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or covered painted tile . There was no furniture at all . In its ruin and dirt the high hall was beautiful , bare , full of clear evening light . Both veots had left his group and were reporting to some men in the doorway of what had been a reception room . He felt the veots as safeguard and hoped they would come back , but they did not . One of the young men kept his arm twisted up his back . A heavyset man came towards him , staring at him . " You 're the alien called Old Music ? " " I am Hainish , and use that name here . " " Mr. Old Music , you 're to understand that by leaving your embassy in violation of the protection agreement between your ambassador and the Government of Voe Deo , you 've forfeited diplomatic immunity . You may be held in custody , interrogated , and duly punished for any infractions of civil law or crimes of collusion with insurgents and enemies of the State you 're found to have committed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position , " Esdan said . " But you should know , sir , that the Ambassador and the Stabiles of the Ekumen of the Worlds consider me protected both by diplomatic immunity and the laws of the Ekumen . " No harm trying , but his wordy lies were n't listened to . Having recited his litany , the man turned away , and the young men grabbed Esdan again . He was hustled through doorways and corridors that he was now in too much pain to see , down stone stairs , across a wide , cobbled courtyard , and into a room where , with a final agonising jerk on his arm and his feet knocked from under him so that he fell sprawling , they slammed the door and left him belly-down on stone in darkness . He dropped his forehead onto his arm and lay shivering , hearing his breath catch in a whimper again and again . Later on he remembered that night , and other things from the next days and nights . He did not know , then or later , if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely the handy object of aimless brutality and spite , a sort of plaything for the boys . There were kicks , beatings , a great deal of pain , but none of it was clear in his memory later except the crouchcage . He had heard of such things , read about them . He had never seen one . He had never been inside a compound . Foreigners , visitors , were not taken into slave quarters on the estates of Voe Deo . They were served by house-slaves in the houses of the owners . This was a small compound , not more than twenty huts on the women 's side , three longhouses on the gate side . It had housed the staff of a couple of hundred slaves who looked after the house and the immense gardens of Yaramera . They would have been a privileged set compared to the field hands . But not exempt from punishment . The whipping post still stood near the high gate that sagged open in the high walls . " There ? " said Nemeo , the one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alatual , said , " No , come on , it 's over here , " and ran ahead , excited , to winch the crouchcage down from where it hung below the main sentry station , high up on the inside of the wall . It was a tube of coarse , rusty steel mesh sealed at one end and closable at the other . It hung suspended by a single hook from a chain . Lying on the ground it looked like a trap for an animal , not a very big animal . The two young men stripped off his clothes and goaded him to crawl into it headfirst , using the fieldhandlers , electric prods to stir up lazy slaves , which they had been playing with the last couple of days . They screamed with laughter , pushing him and jabbing the prods in his anus and scrotum . He writhed into the cage until he was crouching in it head down , his arms and legs bent and jammed up into his body . They slammed the trap end shut , catching his naked foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while they hoisted the cage back up . It swung about wildly , and he clung to the wires with his cramped hands . When he opened his eyes he saw the ground swinging about seven or eight meters below him . After a while the lurching and circling stopped . He could not move his head at all . He could see what was below the crouchcage , and by straining his eyes round he could see most of the inside of the compound . In the old days there had been people down there to see the moral spectacle , a slave in the crouchcage . There had been children to learn the lesson of what happens to a housemaid who shirked a job , a gardener who spoiled a cutting , a hand who talked back to a boss . Nobody was there now . The dusty ground was bare . The dried-up garden plots , the little graveyard at the far edge of a woman 's side , the ditch between the two sides , the pathways , a vague circle of greener grass right underneath him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while laughing and talking , got bored , went off . He tried to ease his position but could move only very slightly . Any motion made the cage rock and swing so that he grew sick and increasingly fearful of falling . He did not know how securely the cage was balanced on that single hook . His foot , caught in the cage closure , hurt so sharply that he longed to faint , but though his head swam he remained conscious . He tried to breathe as he had learned how to breathe a long time ago on another world , quietly , easily . He could not do it here now in this world in this cage . His lungs were squeezed in his rib cage so that each breath was extremely difficult . He tried not to suffocate . He tried not to panic . He tried to be aware , only to be aware , but awareness was unendurable . When the sun came round to that side of the compound and shone full on him the dizziness turned to sickness . Sometimes then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold and he tried to imagine water , but there was no water . He thought later he had been in the crouchcage two days . He could remember the scraping of the wires on his sunburned naked flesh when they pulled him out , the shock of cold water played over him from a hose . He had been fully aware for a moment then , aware of himself , like a doll , lying small , limp , on dirt , while men above him talked and shouted about something . Then he must have been carried back to the cell or stable where he was kept , for there was dark and silence , but also he was still hanging in the crouchcage roasting in the icy fire of the sun , freezing in his burning body , fitted tighter and tighter into the exact mesh of the wires of pain . At some point he was taken to a bed in a room with a window , but he was still in the crouchcage , swinging high above the dusty ground , the dusties ' ground , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavyset man were there , were not there . A bondswoman , whey-faced , crouching and trembling , hurt him trying to put salve on his burned arm and leg and back . She was there and not there . The sun shone in the window . He felt the wire snap down on his foot again , and again . Darkness eased him . He slept most of the time . After a couple of days he could sit up and eat what the scared bondswoman brought him . His sunburn was healing , and most of his aches and pains were milder . His foot was swollen hugely ; bones were broken ; that did n't matter till he had to get up . He dozed , drifted . When Rayaye walked into the room , he recognised him at once . They had met several times , before the Uprising . Rayaye had been Minister of Foreign Affairs under President Oyo . What position he had now , in the Legitimate Government , Esdan did not know . Rayaye was short for a Werelian but broad and solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a striking man , a politician . " Minister Rayaye , " Esdan said . " Mr. Old Music . How kind of you to recall me ! I 'm sorry you 've been unwell . I hope the people here are looking after you satisfactorily ? " " Thank you . " " When I heard you were unwell I inquired for a doctor , but there 's no one here but a veterinarian . No staff at all . Not like the old days ! What a change ! I wish you 'd seen Yaramera in its glory . " " I did . " His voice was rather weak , but sounded quite natural . " Thirty-two or - three years ago . Lord and Lady Aneo entertained a party from our embassy . " " Really ? Then you know what it was , " said Rayaye , sitting down in the one chair , a fine old piece missing one arm . " Painful to see it like this , is n't it ! The worst of the destruction was here in the house . The whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gardens were spared , may the Lady be praised . Laid out by Meneya himself , you know , four hundred years ago . And the fields are still being worked . I 'm told there are still nearly three thousand assets attached to the property . When the trouble 's over , it 'll be far easier to restore Yaramera than many of the great estates . " He gazed out the window . " Beautiful , beautiful . And Aneos ' housepeople were famous for their beauty , you know . And training . It 'll take a long time to build up to that kind of standard again . " " No doubt . " The Werelian looked at him with bland attentiveness . " I expect you 're wondering why you 're here . " " Not particularly , " Esdan said pleasantly . " Oh ? " " Since I left the Embassy without permission , I suppose the Government wanted to keep an eye on me . " " Some of us were glad to hear you 'd left the Embassy . Shut up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my talents , " Esdan said with a deprecatory shrug , which hurt his shoulder . He would wince later . Just now he was enjoying himself . He liked fencing . " You 're a very talented man , Mr. Old Music . The wisest , canniest alien on Werel , Lord Mehao called you once . You 've worked with usand against us , yesmore effectively than any other offworlder . We understand one another . We can talk . It 's my belief that you genuinely wish my people well , and that if I offered you a way of serving thema hope of bringing this terrible conflict to an endyou 'd take it . " " I would hope to be able to . " " Is it important to you that you be identified as a supporter of one side of the conflict , or would you prefer to remain neutral ? " " Any action can bring neutrality into question . " " To have been kidnapped from the Embassy by the rebels is no evidence of your sympathy for them . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It would be so perceived . " " It can be . If you like . " " My preferences are of no weight , Minister . " " They 're of very great weight , Mr. Old Music . But here . You 've been ill , I 'm tiring you . We 'll continue our conversation tomorrow , eh ? If you like . " " Of course , Minister , " Esdan said , with a politeness edging on submissiveness , a tone that he knew suited men like this one , more accustomed to the attention of slaves than the company of equals . Never having equated incivility with pride , Esdan , like most of his people , was disposed to be polite in any circumstance that allowed it , and disliked circumstances that did not . Mere hypocrisy did not trouble him . He was perfectly capable of it himself . If Rayaye 's men had tortured him and Rayaye pretended ignorance of the fact , Esdan had nothing to gain by insisting on it . He was glad , indeed , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to think about it . His body thought about it for him , remembered it precisely , in every joint and muscle , now . The rest of his thinking about it he would do as long as he lived . He had learned things he had not known . He had thought he understood what it was to be helpless . Now he knew he had not understood . When the scared woman came in , he asked her to send for the veterinarian . " I need a cast on my foot , " he said . " He does mend the hands , the bondsfolk , master , " the woman whispered , shrinking . The assets here spoke an archaic-sounding dialect that was sometimes hard to follow . " Can he come into the house ? " She shook her head . " Is there anybody here who can look after it ? " " I will ask , master , " she whispered . An old bondswoman came in that night . She had a wrinkled , seared , stern face , and none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw him , she whispered , " Mighty Lord ! " But she performed the reverence stiffly , and then examined his swollen foot , impersonal as any doctor . She said , " If you do let me bind that , master , it will heal . " " What 's broken ? " " These toes . There . Maybe a little bone in here , too . Lotsalot bones in feet . " " Please bind it for me . " She did so , firmly , binding cloths round and round until the wrapping was quite thick and kept his foot immobile at one angle . She said , " You do walk , then you use a stick , sir . You put down only that heel to the ground . " He asked her name . " Gana , " she said . Saying her name , she shot a sharp glance right at him , full face , a daring thing for a slave to do . She probably wanted to get a good look at his alien eyes , having found the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bones in the feet and all . " Thank you , Gana . I 'm grateful for your skill and kindness . " She bobbed , but did not reverence , and left the room . She herself walked lame , but upright . " All the grandmothers are rebels , " somebody had told him long ago , before the Uprising . The next day he was able to get up and hobble to the broken-armed chair . He sat for a while looking out the window . The room looked out from the second floor over the gardens of Yaramera , terraced slopes and flowerbeds , walks , lawns , and a series of ornamental lakes and pools that descended gradually to the river : a vast pattern of curves and planes , plants and paths , earth and still water , embraced by the broad living curve of the river . All the plots and walks and terraces formed a soft geometry centered very subtly on an enormous tree down at the riverside . It must have been a great tree when the garden was laid out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back from the bank , but its branches reached far out over the water , and a village could have been built in its shade . The grass of the terraces had dried to soft gold . The river and the lakes and pools were all the misty blue of the summer sky . The flowerbeds and shrubberies were untended , overgrown , but not yet gone wild . The gardens of Yaramera were utterly beautiful in their desolation . Desolate , forlorn , forsaken , all such romantic words befitted them , yet they were also rational and noble , full of peace . They had been built by the labor slaves . Their dignity and peace were founded on cruelty , misery , pain . Esdan was Hainish , from a very old people , people who had built and destroyed Yaramera a thousand times . His mind contained the beauty and the terrible grief of the place , assured that the existence of one can not justify the other , the destruction of one can not destroy the other . He was aware of both , only aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body at last , that the lovely sorrowful terraces of Yaramera might contain within them the terraces of Darranda on Hain , roof below red roof , garden below green garden , dropping steep down to the shining harbor , the promenades and piers and sailboats . Out past the harbor the sea rises up , stands up as high as his house , as high as his eyes . Esi knows that books say the sea lies down . " The sea lies calm tonight , " says the poem , but he knows better . The sea stands , a wall , the blue-grey wall at the end of the world . If you sail out on it , it will seem flat , but if you see it truly , it 's as tall as the hills of Darranda , and if you sail truly on it , you will sail through that wall to the other side , beyond the end of the world . The sky is the roof that wall holds up . At night the stars shine through the glass air roof . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the world . " Esi , " somebody calls from indoors , and he turns away from the sea and the sky , leaves the balcony , goes in to meet the guests , or for his music lesson , or to have lunch with the family . He 's a nice little boy , Esi : obedient , cheerful , not talkative but quite sociable , interested in people . With very good manners , of course ; after all , he 's a Kelwen and the older generation would n't stand for anything less in a child of the family , but good manners come easy to him , perhaps because he 's never seen any bad ones . Not a dreamy child . Alert , present , noticing . But thoughtful , and given to explaining things to himself , such as the wall of the sea and the roof of the air . Esi is n't as clear and close to Esdan as he used to be ; he 's a little boy a long time ago and very far away , left behind , left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes , or breathe the marvelous intricate smell of the house in Darrandawood , the resinous oil used to polish the wood , sweetgrass matting , fresh flowers , kitchen herbs , the sea windor hear his mother 's voice : " Esi ? Come on in now , love . The cousins are here from Dorased ! " Esi runs in to meet the cousins , old Iliawad with crazy eyebrows and hair in his nostrils , who can do magic with bits of sticky tape , and Tuitui who 's better at catch than Esi even though she 's younger , while Esdan falls asleep in the broken chair by the window looking out on the terrible , beautiful gardens . Further conversations with Bayaye were deferred . The zadyo came with his apologies . The Minister had been called back to speak with the President , would return within three or four days . Esdan realised he had heard a flyer take off early in the morning , not far away . It was a reprieve . He enjoyed fencing , but was still very tired , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came into his room but the scared woman , Heo , and the zadyo who came once a day to ask if he had all he needed . When he could he was permitted to leave his room , go outside if he wished . By using a stick and strapping his bound foot onto a stiff old sandal-sole Gana brought him , he could walk , and so get out into the gardens and sit in the sun , which was growing milder daily as the summer grew old . The two veots were his guards , or more exactly guardians . He saw the two young men who had tortured him ; they kept at a distance , evidently under orders not to approach him . One of the veots was usually in view , but never crowded him . He could not go far . Sometimes he felt like a bug on a beach . The part of the house that was still usable was huge , the gardens were vast , the people were very few . There were the six men who had brought him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commanded by the heavyset man Tualenem . Of the original asset population of the house and estate there were ten or twelve , a tiny remnant of the house-staff of cooks , cooks ' helpers , washwomen , chambermaids , ladies ' maids , bodyservants , shoe-polishers , window-cleaners , gardeners , path-rakers , waiters , footmen , errandboys , stablemen , drivers , use-women and useboys who had served the owners and their guests in the old days . These few were no longer locked up at night in the old house-asset compound where the crouchcage was , but slept in the courtyard warren of stables for horses and people where he had been kept at first , or in the complex of rooms around the kitchens . Most of these remaining few were women , two of them young , and two or three old , frail-looking men . He was cautious of speaking to any of them at first lest he get them into trouble , but his captors ignored them except to give orders , evidently considering them trustworthy , with good reason . Troublemakers , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great house , killed the bosses and owners , were long gone : dead , escaped , or reenslaved with a cross branded deep on both cheeks . These were good dusties . Very likely they had been loyal all along . Many bondspeople , especially personal slaves , as terrified by the Uprising as their owners , had tried to defend them or had fled with them . They were no more traitors than were owners who had freed their assets and fought on the Liberation side . As much , and no more . Girls , young field hands , were brought in one at a time as use-women for the men . Every day or two the two young men who had tortured him drove a landcar off in the morning with a used girl and came back with a new one . Of the two younger house bondswomen , one called Kamsa always carried her little baby around with her , and the men ignored her . The other , Heo , was the scared one who had waited on him . Tualenem used her every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they or any of the bondspeople passed Esdan in the house or outdoors they dropped their hands to their sides , chin to the chest , looked down , and stood still : the formal reverence expected of personal assets facing an owner . " Good morning , Kamsa . " Her reply was the reverence . It had been years now since he had been with the finished product of generations of slavery , the kind of slave described as " perfectly trained , obedient , selfless , loyal , the ideal personal asset , " when they were put up for sale . Most of the assets he had known , his friends and colleagues , had been city rentspeople , hired out by their owners to companies and corporations to work in factories or shops or at skilled trades . He had also known a good many field hands . Field hands seldom had any contact with their owners ; they worked under gareot bosses , and their compounds were run by cutfrees , eunuch assets . The ones he knew had mostly been runaways protected by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independence in Yeowe . None of them had been utterly deprived of education , options , any imagination of freedom , as these bondspeople were . He had forgotten what a good dusty was like . He had forgotten the utter impenetrability of the person who has no private life , the intactness of the wholly vulnerable . Kamsa 's face was smooth , serene , and showed no feeling , though he heard her sometimes talking and singing very softly to her baby , a joyful , merry little noise . It drew him . He saw her one afternoon sitting at work on the coping of the great terrace , the baby in its sling on her back . He limped over and sat down nearby . He could not prevent her from setting her knife and board aside and standing head and hands and eyes down in reverence as he came near . " Please sit down , please go on with your work , " he said . She obeyed . " What 's that you 're cutting up ? " " Dueli , master , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eaten and enjoyed . He watched her work . Each big , woody pod had to be split along a sealed seam , not an easy trick ; it took a careful search for the opening point and hard , repeated twists of the blade to open the pod . Then the fat edible seeds had to be removed one by one and scraped free of a stringy , clinging matrix . " Does that part taste bad ? " he asked . " Yes , master . " It was a laborious process , requiring strength , skill , and patience . He was ashamed . " I never saw raw dueli before , " he said . " No , master . " " What a good baby , " he said , a little at random . The tiny creature in its sling , its head lying on her shoulder , had opened large bluish-black eyes and was gazing vaguely at the world . He had never heard it cry . It seemed rather unearthly to him , but he had not had much to do with babies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , master . " He said , " Please , Kamsa , my name is Esdan . I 'm not a master . I 'm a prisoner . Your masters are my masters . Will you call me by my name ? " She did not answer . " Our masters would disapprove . " She nodded . The Werelian nod was a tip-back of the head , not a bob down . He was completely used to it after all these years . It was the way he nodded himself . He noticed himself noticing it now . His captivity , his treatment here , had displaced , disoriented him . These last few days he had thought more about Hain than he had for years , decades . He had been at home on Werel , and now was not . Inappropriate comparisons , irrelevant memories . Alienated . " They put me in the cage , " he said , speaking as low as she did and hesitating on the last word . He could not say the whole word , crouchcage . Again the nod . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at him , the flick of a glance . She said soundlessly , " I know , " and went on with her work . He found nothing more to say . " I was a pup , then I did live there , " she said , with a glance in the direction of the compound where the cage was . Her murmuring voice was profoundly controlled , as were all her gestures and movements . " Before that time the house burned . When the masters did live here . They did often hang up the cage . Once , a man for until he did die there . In that . I saw that . " Silence between them . " We pups never did go under that . Never did run there . " " I saw the ... the ground was different , underneath , " Esdan said , speaking as softly and with a dry mouth , his breath coming short . " I saw , looking down . The grass . I thought maybe ... where they ... " His voice dried up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , a cloth on the end of that , and wet it , and hold it up to him . The cutfrees did look away . But he did die . And rot some time . " " What had he done ? " " Enna , " she said , the one-word denial he 'd often heard assets useI do n't know , I did n't do it , I was n't there , it 's not my fault , who knows .... He 'd seen an owner 's child who said " enna " be slapped , not for the cup she broke but for using a slave word . " A useful lesson , " he said . He knew she 'd understand him . Underdogs know irony like they know air and water . " They did put you in that , then I did fear , " she said . " The lesson was for me , not you , this time , " he said . She worked , carefully , ceaselessly . He watched her work . Her downcast face , clay-color with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was darker-skinned than she . She had not been bred to a bondsman , but used by an owner . They called rape use . The baby 's eyes closed slowly , translucent bluish lids like little shells . It was small and delicate , probably only a month or two old . Its head lay with infinite patience on her stooping shoulder . No one else was out on the terraces . A slight wind stirred in the flowering trees behind them , streaked the distant river with silver . " Your baby , Kamsa , you know , he will be free , " Esdan said . She looked up , not at him , but at the river and across it . She said , " Yes . He will be free . " She went on working . It heartened him , her saying that to him . It did him good to know she trusted him . He needed someone to trust him , for since the cage he could not trust himself . With Rayaye he was all right ; he could still fence ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was alone , thinking , sleeping . He was alone most of the time . Something in his mind , deep in him , was injured , broken , had not mended , could not be trusted to bear his weight . ( Continues ... )
