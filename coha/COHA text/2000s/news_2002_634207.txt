<p> Apparently , the Masters now ends before the back nine on Sunday . <p> It 's a new world at Augusta National , and not just because of the course changes . No more Arnold Palmer . No more lifetime exemptions for Masters champions . No more automatic invitations for PGA Tour winners . <p> And if this year 's tournament is any indication , no more of the birdie-binge shootouts that made the Masters famous . The only constant , it appears , is that the world 's best players still are chasing Tiger Woods  --  and not gaining much ground . <p> Woods ' psychological edge over his rivals grows with each major title , and it 's clear no one from the early-30s group of Phil Mickelson , Ernie Els and David Duval will overtake him . While they will continue to be his closest challengers for the next few years and are likely to sneak in the odd major , the true competition must come from those younger than Woods , 26 . <p> Unlike the older opponents , the early-20s sect has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sergio Garcia , Charles Howell and Adam Scott provide the most hope for a future rivalry , with fellow up-and-comers such as Paul Casey , Luke Donald , Nick Dougherty and Bryce Molder also gunning for Woods . <p> Behind them are teens who picked up the sport in the wake of Tigermania and dream of beating their idol , just as Woods used to imagine battling Jack Nicklaus and Ben Hogan . These are the players whom Woods says the changes at Augusta and other courses are for , athletic youngsters who might one day make Woods seem like a short hitter . <p> Garcia is the most advanced of the young guns , having pushed Woods to the edge as a 19-year-old in the 1999 PGA Championship at Medinah . Since then , he has entered the final round of two majors in serious contention : the U.S. Open last year and the Masters last week . He flamed out both times , shooting a 77 at Southern Hills and a 75 at Augusta , but it 's easy to forget he 's only 22 , and he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made solid Masters debuts last week and spoke thoughtfully afterward about the lessons they learned : patience , experience and mental preparation . Scott , 21 , was particularly impressive , shooting par or better in every round to tie for ninth . His final-round 70 was bettered by only one player , Shigeki Maruyama with a 67 . <p> I 've always thought Adam had a beautiful swing , but I saw something at the Masters , " Brad Faxon , who played with Scott on Sunday , told the Australian Associated Press . He drove the ball fantastically , he looked under control , composed and confident , and he putted well . " <p> Scott and Woods share the same coach , Butch Harmon , and the young Aussie 's swing compares favorably with Tiger 's . <p> I 'm sure he knows a little of the secrets of Tiger and his work ethic , " Faxon said . The kid 's got a great future . I 'd like to buy a little stock in him if I could . He has n't gotten the publicity over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> STRAIGHT TALK : It would be silly to disregard Woods ' chances of winning the calendar-year Grand Slam  --  as he was quick to point out , I 've done four in a row before "  --  but he 'll need to improve his driving accuracy numbers to take the U.S. Open at Bethpage Black . Woods hit 37 of 56 fairways at Augusta , not terrible but better than only 12 players who made the cut . <p> With much more penal rough expected at Bethpage , Woods must find the short grass more often . He can do that by hitting his low 2-iron stinger " off the tee , but indifferent performances at Southern Hills and Royal Lytham last summer showed that when a course takes the driver out of Woods ' hands , he loses a big part of his advantage . <p> Woods ' two strong showings in the U.S. Open  --  a tie for third in 1999 at Pinehurst No. 2 and the 15-shot victory in 2000 at Pebble Beach  --  came on relatively spacious courses for the Open .
