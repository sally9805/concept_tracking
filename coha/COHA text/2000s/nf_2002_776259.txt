Excerpt // Hester Thrale // On a spring morning in 1766 , Henry and Hester Thrale visited Dr. Samuel Johnson in his rooms at Johnson 's Court . // The lively , attractive young couple had known the famous writer since 1764 , when the playwright Arthur Murphy had brought Johnson to dinner at the Thrales ' estate in Streatham Park , a few miles from central London . Since then , he had been a regular guest at Streatham , and at the Thrales ' city place in Southwark , on the grounds of their profitable brewery . But lately , Johnson 's visits had tapered off , and the Thrales had reason to suspect that he was suffering from one of the profound and terrifying fits of melancholia that had plagued him for most of his fifty-seven years . Already , they had grown close enough for Johnson to have confided his fears about " the horrible condition of his mind , which he said was nearly distracted . " // Unlikely on the surface , the friendship was a tremendous coup for the socially ambitious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dictionary , the Rambler essays , The Life of Savage , and Rasselas but for his witty conversation . Among fashionable Londoners , watching the doctor talk had become a sort of spectator sport ; at parties , guests crowded , four and five deep , around his chair to listen . // Johnson brought his own celebrity talking-and-sparring partners - David Garrick , Oliver Goldsmith , Sir Joshua Reynolds - along with him to Streatham , possibly because brisk repartee was not his host 's strong suit . Well meaning and personable , properly insistent on his masculine right to overeat , hunt , and cheat publicly on his wife , Henry Thrale lacked , according to Johnson , the finer social skills . " His conversation does not show the minute hand ; but he strikes the hour very correctly . " He was the sort of rich , dull , solid fellow - " such dead , though excellent , mutton , " to quote Virginia Woolf 's wicked assessment of Rebecca West 's husband - who turns up , with surprising frequency , in the lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he admired the manly way he ran his household , and enjoyed the benefits of his expensive tastes in food and wine . Driven by an increasing horror of solitude and a craving for human companionship , the writer was drawn to the vibrant domesticity of Streatham , and especially to his hostess , a slight , dark-eyed Welsh fireball , who was disputatious , flirtatious , quick , well educated , and ( unlike many of their contemporaries ) unafraid of a man whom she described as having " a roughness in his manner which subdued the saucy and terrified the meek ; this was , when I knew him , the prominent part of a character which few durst venture to approach so nearly . " // Chroniclers of the period record the sparkling sorties that flew back and forth across the table between Samuel Johnson and Mrs. Thrale . And her own Anecdotes of the Late Samuel Johnson , LL.D. , published in 1785 , functions as a compendium not only of the writer 's witticisms , but also of their exchanges on subjects ranging from faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyday knowledge , from marital discord to convent life , from the pleasures of traveling by coach to the rewards of reading Don Quixote , from the correct way to raise children to the necessity of constantly measuring one 's minor complaints against the greater sufferings and privations of the poor . // The Thrales were tolerant of the writer 's notorious eccentricities . Eventually , they would assign a servant to stand outside his door with a fresh wig for him to wear to dinner , since he so often singed the front of his wig by reading too close to the lamp . Nearly blind , disfigured by pockmarks , Johnson suffered from scrofula and a host of somatic complaints , as well as an array of psychological symptoms that , today , would virtually ensure that he was medicated for Tourette 's , obsessive-compulsive disorder , bipolar disorder , to name just the obvious syndromes . ( The ongoing discussion of Johnson 's " case " in medical literature has made him one of those figures , like Van Gogh and Lizzie Siddal , whose health care improved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own more permissive era was sufficiently enchanted by his intelligence , humor , and unflagging energy to overlook his rocking from foot to foot , mumbling , twitching , emitting startling verbal outbursts , obsessively counting his footsteps , touching each lamppost in the street , and performing an elaborate shuffle before he could enter a doorway . // The Thrales were used to the doctor 's tics . Yet nothing could have prepared them for the scene they found on that May morning when at last they were admitted to the writer 's rooms at Johnson 's Court . His friend John Delap was just leaving , and it must have been instantly obvious - from how pathetically he begged Delap to include him in his prayers - that the great Samuel Johnson was veering out of control . // Left alone with the Thrales , Johnson became so overwrought , so violent in his self-accusations , so reckless in alluding to the sins for which he said he needed forgiveness that Henry and Hester were soon caught up in the general hysteria . " I felt excessively affected with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hand to shut his mouth , from provocation at hearing a man so wildly proclaim what he could at last persuade no one to believe ; and what , if true , would have been so very unfit to reveal . " // It was an extraordinary scene : the handsome brewer clapping one hand over the mouth of London 's most celebrated literary figure , while his agitated wife looked on in dread and horror . Something irreversible was happening to their friendship ! The balance of power and need was being tipped forever by what Johnson was letting them see . They 'd arrived as friends and hosts flattered by the doctor 's affections , but uninvited , and perhaps a bit uncertain about their welcome and the future of their friendship . And now they had been drawn into this theatrical , eroticized tableau , from which they would emerge as guardians , saviors , confessors ... // ( Continues ... ) //
