All the Things She Knew <p> Annelise was hungry . She wanted a grilled cheese sandwich and pickles and a vanilla Coke and a slice of banana-coconut cream pie , all of which , she knew , could be found at Moon 's Luncheonette , four blocks away . She put on her sunglasses and went out the back door of WOOP , the radio station where she worked for measly wages as a late-night deejay ( and daytime receptionist and dogsbody ) . She walked up the alley , toward Fond du Lac Street , humming a Woody Guthrie song called " Way Over Yonder in the Minor Key , " about an ugly boy who charms girls with his voice . One of the nice things about doing radio-or lefty , shoestring radio , anyway-was that you could be gangly and goggle-eyed and no listener was the wiser . ( Not that Annelise was either . ) Your voice was all anybody could " see . " On her next show , she would pour Woody Guthrie ( or Billy Bragg singing Woody Guthrie ) into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do her monologue , maybe tell a story about how she was walking down an alley early one summer afternoon , hungry for sugar and pickles . No , she was not pregnant . <p> It was garbage day in this part of Midvale , Wisconsin , but the garbage men had n't ventured into the alley yet . Among the things awaiting them were a plaid dog bed and a scrap of green shag carpeting and a three-legged chair from which the stuffing was spilling . On the chair was a man 's white plantation-style suit , somewhat the worse for the wear . Annelise , who was thirty-one , whose closet and car were full of things she 'd picked up at garage sales and scavenged from the curb , did n't know any men who might be willing to wear a white suit . Her boyfriend , a Republican , had a sense of humor , but he was n't going to dress like Tom Wolfe or Big Daddy . <p> A little farther on , she saw a typewriter on top of a garbage can . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from at least before her parents were born . Somebody had put out a cigar on the platen and left the stub in the typebar basket . Several of the keypads were missing . There were streaks of Wite-Out-or was it bird droppings ? - on the housing surrounding the typebar basket . She pressed the space bar and the carriage moved along , in a jittery , hesitant way . A little bell rang before the carriage reached its endpoint . <p> Annelise shook the cigar butt out of the typewriter and carried the machine back to her car . Its heft , all that dense metal from the last century , would have made it just the thing for hammering out a manifesto or a love letter as serious as a poem . Not that she felt the urge to do either at the moment . ( The last time she 'd felt compelled to tell somebody that she loved him , she 'd done it via text message . ) But she had a side that was preservationist or maybe just sentimental . <p> She put the typewriter next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat if she did n't get them out of the car soon . Then she walked back down the alley to Fond du Lac Avenue and on to Moon 's Luncheonette . When Mr. Moon stopped talking to her in his rapid , Korean-inflected English , she thought about Rolf , the man she was living with , who worked for a company that made stents . She was not sure she and Rolf were a good match . She looked at other men all the time , not only out of curiosity . Rolf had a birthday coming up , his thirty-eighth . She could get him a shirt , maybe even one with a little color , or she could give him a typewriter on which he could type love letters to her . Though , of course , love letters ( or even , for that matter , text messages ) were not his strength . But the Marvin the Martian toothbrush she 'd given him had amused him , and so had the transistor radio . <p> Annelise licked the last coconut shaving of Mrs. Moon 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and stepped out of the air conditioning into the midsummer heat . She thought she 'd sweat off half the pound she 'd just put on by the time she got back to the station . She adjusted her sunglasses , cheap ones with big frames ; she always felt better behind them . <p> Despite her sugar habit , she did n't need to lose weight . She was short but lean and narrow everywhere , except in her bottom , which was a little wide and quivery . Sometimes she could not help admiring her legs and even her bottom , and sometimes she wished they were not hers , or rather , she wished she was n't theirs . Her posture was less than erect , and it and her gait , a slink with some droop in it , suggested she had secrets that weighed her down . <p> As the commercial districts of Midvale went , Fond du Lac Avenue was a bit of a backwater . On the block where Annelise was walking , there was a business that sold wheelchairs and prosthetic devices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a socialist who ran for mayor every four years ) and a tattoo parlor and a typewriter repair shop called The Typing Poole . Annelise had walked by The Typing Poole often enough to be mildly annoyed by the pun in its name , a pun you might imagine was a typo if you had failed to notice on the door the small print ( in a font called Bookman Old Style ) below the larger print ( in Bookman Old Style , too ) of the shop 's name : O. W. Poole , Prop . The Typing Poole did n't promote itself with much flair . The window display consisted of three typewriters garlanded by two thirsty-looking spider plants . <p> Annelise continued on to her car and then came back to The Typing Poole with the Royal in her arms . ( In addition to cigar , it smelled of pee and a back-alley odor that she , despite her excellent nose , could n't identify . Rum , maybe . ) The Typing Poole 's reception room was cooled by a ceiling fan . Its furnishings included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typewriter innards and adding machines ; an orange vinyl armchair ; a framed poster of an early-twentieth-century woman with her fingers poised above an Oliver typewriter ; a side table with a Christmas cactus and a copy of The Nation on it ; and a hat tree on which a gray fedora and an umbrella were hung . The Typing Poole smelled of dust and machine oil and Asian takeout . The proprietor was not to be seen . Annelise took off her sunglasses . On the sales counter was a bell and next to it was a handwritten note that said , " Please ring . " Annelise rang , once , a polite tap that would n't have awakened a flea from a nap . She heard music-trumpets and trombones , and behind them , gravelly , scratchy voices harmonizing-coming from behind a door that led into the back of the shop . She rang the bell again , twice , quickly , hoping she was n't conveying urgency or impatience . She thought a man who repaired typewriters in 2004 A.D. might be testy , that he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a florist might . ( The calendar on the wall behind the counter had a flower theme . Were those lush June sexpots peonies ? Was n't today July 18 ? ) She imagined that the man-she assumed it would be a man ; a woman might choose to repair zippers or shoes or watches but nothing so nearly obsolete as a typewriter-who came from behind the door would have silver-rimmed glasses perched on his nose and hair growing out of his ears and a scowl to scare away the curious . And if it were winter , he would be wearing a cardigan stained with soup . But it was summer , hot as blazes , and she was sweating under the arms of her T-shirt . <p> She rang once more , this time as if she meant it . When he appeared , a tall man whose head skimmed just under the doorway , she took a step back from the counter , as if ceding it to him . He was wearing a green eyeshade and looked to be half-asleep . Tawny , gray-streaked hair fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had a spot of sweat at the sternum . The fact that he looked at her from a height-from an altitude , really ; she came up to his Adam 's apple-may have explained why he did n't look directly at her when he spoke . Or perhaps it was the sight of the Royal and the smells that emanated from it that distracted him . The first thing he said to her was " What can you help me with ? " As far as she could tell , he was n't trying to be funny . He pushed the bill of his eyeshade upward with his forefinger and said , " Let me do that over . What can I help you with ? " <p> She said , " I found this typewriter . " <p> He gave the platen a half-turn , pressed down on the Shift key . " A Quiet De Luxe . Hemingway used this model , I believe . It was quite popular in its day . " <p> He gave her a smile that did n't even reveal the tips of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right then , she supposed later , with those two ancient voices ( one , she knew , was Louis Armstrong 's ) singing in the background , that she decided she wanted to explore this man 's disappointments and desires . This was less a conscious decision that she articulated to herself than it was like something that spasmed way down inside her , though maybe that was only gastric turbulence . But some moments later , when he was again fiddling with the bill of his eyeshade like a baseball pitcher looking in for a sign , while she was babbling about her interest in old-fashioned things , the feeling that she might like to know him had spread up into her shoulders and neck . She felt the skin on her chest and throat pinkening , as if with desire ( or embarrassment that her desire might be too visible ) . She liked the sound of his voice , she liked the shape of his mouth ( small but not pinched ) , she liked the silver spider-web-like hairs that flourished in the hollow at the base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other singer was ( Jack Teagarden ) and the name of the song that Teagarden and Armstrong were singing ( " Rockin ' Chair " ) . She liked that when she said ( a bit more forwardly than was her custom ) that she did a late-night radio show and that maybe she would play that song on it , he said , " I 'd listen , if I did n't go to bed so early . " <p> He said he would have the Royal fixed up within a couple of days . " I 'll clear a space on my schedule for it . " Perhaps this was a joke . He did n't seem to be swamped by work . <p> It worried her that she liked a man so immediately , though this worried her less than did the fact that he appeared to be married . ( The fact that he was older , a good decade and a half older , she guessed , did n't trouble her that much . Older men were a weakness of hers and she did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wedding band might have deterred her , but when she went out the shop door and the heat smacked her in the face , she did n't reconsider . She wanted to see him again , right away , which was possibly why she 'd left her sunglasses on his counter . When she went back in to retrieve them , he asked at what hour her radio show came on . <p> She said , " Eleven on Thursday . " <p> He said , " Maybe I 'll take an extra-long afternoon nap so I can stay up late that night . " <p> She gave him her card , something a friend had designed and that she had never handed out to anybody , as far as she could remember . <p> He said , " Annelise Scharfenberg . " He said it again , as if he was trying to figure out how to get his mouth around all of it . " Do you get a lot of mail from listeners ? " <p> She said , " I get an occasional e-mail , mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many old fogies and dead people . " <p> Mr. Poole said , " I did n't used to have a computer as a matter of principle , but now I do . I keep it in back , out of sight . Maybe I 'll send you a fan e-mail . " And then he asked her who the three people on her T-shirt were . <p> She looked down at her bosom and said they were a local band called No Shoes . " I know the drummer , the one in the middle with the glasses . He was in my Shakespeare class in college . I play them on my show sometimes , so the younger listeners wo n't abandon me completely . No Shoes does moody , jangly , retro-psychedelic , retro-folk-rock , post-grunge stuff , kind of like My Morning Jacket . Do you know My Morning Jacket ? " <p> Mr. Poole said he did n't , but he was looking at her in a way that suggested he wanted to know all the things she knew . <p> Chapter Two Dog or Coyote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two hairs had sprouted on the ridge , a little north of the swollen tip that a softball had plunked the other evening during a game between the Melody Bar Savages and the Old Hatters . This happened in the third inning . Oliver , the left fielder for the Old Hatters , had reached first when the Savages ' third baseman , an electrician named Crabbe , booted a grounder . It was a tricky grounder , fast and side-spinny , and Oliver would have scored it a hit , but the official scorer , the wife of a Savage , put it down as " E-5 . " The next batter , a used-bookshop clerk named Garr , hit a blooper over the head of the Savages ' shortstop , and Oliver got it into his head that he could reach third base without even drawing a throw . <p> Oliver was tall , six-foot-six on most days , a bit shorter during eclipses and tornado watches and before and during airplane rides . He was thin , too , ten pounds thinner than he 'd been twenty-two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was younger-he was fifty-one now-he ran like a veldt animal , eating up ground with his long strides , his shaggy , not yet gray hair flowing out from under his cap . Five or six years ago , he 'd fallen off his bike and banged up his left knee . Now he ran with a bit of a limp . Sciatica afflicted him from time to time , too . The Old Hatters ' shortstop , Murray Gleason , a fifty-six-year-old painter known as the Rabbit Master and Oliver 's best friend on the team , said , " O-Man , some day we 'll trade your ass to the glue dealer , but in the meantime you 're our left fielder . Take lots of ibuprofen and hang in there . " <p> The moment before it had occurred to Oliver to sprint for third , he had been thinking about his lover 's ears , about how small and delicate they were , the lobes hardly big enough to hang earrings from , the rims like tracery . Annelise 's thirty-second birthday was coming up , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd paid a fortune for . When Garr hit that blooper , Oliver 's mind was full of the whorls that were Annelise 's ears , and then he was hoofing it across the hard infield dirt ( it had n't rained for weeks in Midvale ) , one eye on the left fielder , a stocky , lugubrious , gap-toothed plumber who was all stick and no glove . But Belcher , the plumber , came in on the ball more quickly than expected , and Oliver , who had by then mindlessly rounded second , realized that his chances of reaching third safely had diminished . He heard someone shout , " Go back , you idiot , go back ! " It was a kid 's voice . It might have been the voice of one of his boys-he had four , and all but the seven-year-old tossed the term " idiot " around freely-though none of them had come to the game . But it was too late to stop . Oliver saw Crabbe , with his red Fu Manchu and his jersey emblazoned with the Melody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one hand and a martini in the other ) , waiting for him at third , crouched like some bristly , thickset housecat watching a mouse hole . Having already crossed the line into unreason , Oliver decided to slide headfirst . He had not slid headfirst since high school , on a cold , sodden day in April of 1970 , when the ground was just beginning to thaw . He had been in love then , too , with a girl who claimed to have a freckle on the bottom of her big toe and about whose green eyes he had written a poem , and it was at least possible that on that April day in 1970 love had figured into his decision to dive headfirst into the ungiving earth . ( He was out by a mile , and a week later Karin turned him down when he invited her to go to a Unitarian church basement to hear a folk music duo called Phil &amp; Sue . ) When he dove on Wednesday evening , thirty-four years later , he felt as if pricked all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crazy juice . His nose arrived at Crabbe 's lowered knee the instant the softball did . But the ball dribbled away from the butter-fingered third baseman , and Oliver was safe . <p> After the game-the Old Hatters lost-Murray got out his dope pipe and offered it around , to Savages and Old Hatters alike . Oliver took a pass . Hal Sveum , the Old Hatters ' third baseman and a writer for the alternative weekly , who took Pub &amp; Grub League softball more seriously than anybody , marched off toward his car , saying , " We 're a bunch of dope-smoking cripples . " Crabbe patted Oliver on the back and said , " Take good care of that proboscis , Poole . " Oliver , dizzy with thoughts of his lover , said , " OK , thanks , I will .
