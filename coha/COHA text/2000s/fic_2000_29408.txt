CARDBOARD CITY THROUGH this evening 's tide of faces unregistered , unrecognized , amid hurrying black shoes , furled umbrellas , the crowd descending like a single organism into the station 's airless heart , comes Shinya Yamazaki , his notebook clasped beneath his arm like the egg case of some modest but moderately successful marine species . Evolved to cope with jostling elbows , oversized Ginza shopping bags , ruthless briefcases , Yamazaki and his small burden of information go down into the neon depths . Toward this tributary of relative quiet , a tiled corridor connecting parallel escalators . Central columns , sheathed in green ceramic , support a ceiling pocked with dust-furred ventilators , smoke detectors , speakers . Behind the columns , against the far wall , derelict shipping cartons huddle in a ragged train , improvised shelters constructed by the city 's homeless . Yamazaki halts , and in that moment all the oceanic clatter of commuting feet washes in , no longer held back by his sense of mission , and he deeply and sincerely wishes he were elsewhere . He winces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swathed in Chanel micropore , rolls over his toes with an expensive three-wheeled stroller . Blurting a convulsive apology , Yamazaki glimpses the infant passenger through flexible curtains of some pink-tinted plastic , the glow of a video display winking as its mother trundles determinedly away . Yamazaki sighs , unheard , and limps toward the cardboard shelters . He wonders briefly what the passingcommuters will think , to see him enter the carton fifth from the left . It is scarcely the height of his chest , longer than the others , vaguely coffin-like , a flap of thumb-smudged white corrugate serving as its door . Perhaps they will not see him , he thinks . Just as he himself has never seen anyone enter or exit one of these tidy hovels . It is as though their inhabitants are rendered invisible in the transaction that allows such structures to exist in the context of the station . He is a student of existential sociology , and such transactions have been his particular concern . And now he hesitates , fighting the urge to remove his shoes and place them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside the entrance flap on a carefully folded sheet of Parco gift wrap . No , he thinks , imagining himself waylaid within , struggling with faceless enemies in a labyrinth of cardboard . Best he not be shoeless . Sighing again , he drops to his knees , the notebook clutched in both hands . He kneels for an instant , hearing the hurrying feet of those who pass behind him . Then he places the notebook on the ceramic tile of the station 's floor and shoves it forward , beneath the corrugate flap , and follows it on his hands and knees . He desperately hopes that he has found the right carton . He freezes there in unexpected light and heat . A single halogen fixture floods the tiny room with the frequency of desert sunlight . Unventilated , it heats the space like a reptile 's cage . " Come in , " says the old man , in Japanese . " Do n't leave your ass hanging out that way . " He is naked except for a sort of breechclout twisted from what may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cross-legged , on a ragged , paint-flecked tatami mat . He holds a brightly colored toy figure in one hand , a slender brush in the other . Yamazaki sees that the thing is a model of some kind , a robot or military exoskeleton . It glitters in the sun-bright light , blue and red and silver . Small tools are spread on the tatami : a razor knife , a sprue cutter , curls of emery paper . The old man is very thin , clean-shaven but in need of a haircut . Wisps of gray hair hang on either side of his face , and his mouth is set in what looks to be a permanent scowl of disapproval . He wears glasses with heavy black plastic frames and archaically thick lenses . The lenses catch the light . Yamazaki creeps obediently into the carton , feeling the door flap drop shut behind him . On hands and knees , he resists the urge to try to bow . " He 's waiting , " the old man says , his brush tip poised above the figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only his head . Yamazaki sees that the carton has been reinforced with mailing tubes , a system that echoes the traditional post-and-beam architecture of Japan , the tubes lashed together with lengths of salvaged poly-ribbon . There are too many objects here , in this tiny space . Towels and blankets and cooking pots on cardboard shelves . Books . A small television . " In there ? " Yamazaki indicates what he takes to be another door , like the entrance to a hutch , curtained with a soiled square of melon-yellow , foam-cored blanket , the sort of blanket one finds in a capsule hotel . But the brush tip dips to touch the model , and the old man is lost in the concentration this requires , so Yamazaki shuffles on hands and knees across the absurdly tiny space and draws the section of blanket aside . Darkness . " Laney-San ? " What seems to be a crumpled sleeping bag . He smells sickness " Yeah ? " A croak . " In here . " Drawing a deep breath , Yamazaki crawls in , pushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the entrance , brightness glows through the synthetic fabric and the thin foam core , like tropical sunlight seen from deep within some coral grotto . " Laney ? " The American groans . Seems to turn , or sit up . Yamazaki ca n't see . Something covers Laney 's eyes . Red wink of a diode . Cables . Faint gleam of the interface , reflected in a thin line against Laney 's sweat-slick cheekbone . " I 'm deep in , now , " Laney says , and coughs . " Deep in what ? " " They did n't follow you , did they ? " " I do n't think so . " " I could tell if they had . " Yamazaki feels sweat run suddenly from both his armpits , coursing down across his ribs . He forces himself to breathe . The air here is foul , thick . He thinks of the seventeen known strains of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis . Laney draws a ragged breath . " But they are n't looking for me , are they ? " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " They wo n't find her , " Laney says . " Not here , Not anywhere . Not now . " " Why did you run away , Laney ? " " The syndrome , " Laney says and coughs again , and Yamazaki feels the smooth , deep shudder of an incoming maglev , somewhere deeper in the station , not mechanical vibration but a vast pistoning of displaced air . " It finally kicked in . The 5-SB . The stalker effect . " Yamazaki hears feet hurrying by , perhaps an arm 's length away , behind the cardboard wall . " It makes you cough ? " Yamazaki blinks , making his new contact lenses swim uncomfortably . " No , " Laney says and coughs into his pale and upraised hand . " Some bug . They all have it , down here . " " I was worried when you vanished . They began to look for you , but when she was gone " " The shit really hit the fan . " " Shit ? " Laney reaches up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what outputs to them , but the shifting light from the display reveals Laney 's hollowed eyes . " It 's all going to change , Yamazaki . We 're coming up on the mother of all nodal points . I can see it , now . It 's all going to change . " " I do n't understand . " " Know what the joke is ? It did n't change when they thought it would . Millennium was a Christian holiday . I 've been looking at history , Yamazaki . I can see the nodal points in history . Last time we had one like this was 1911 . " " What happened in 1911 ? " " Everything changed . " " How ? " " It just did . That 's how it works . I can see it now . " " Laney , " Yamazaki says , " when you told me about the stalker effect , you said that the victims , the test subjects , became obsessed with one particular media figure . " " Yes . " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , eyes lit by a backwash of data . " No . Not with her . Guy named Harwood . Cody Harwood . They 're coming together , though . In San Francisco . And someone else . Leaves a sort of negative trace ; you have to infer everything from the way he 's not there ... " " Why did you ask me here , Laney ? This is a terrible place . Do you wish me to help you to escape ? " Yamazaki is thinking of the blades of the Swiss Army knife in his pocket . One of them is serrated ; he could easily cut his way out through the wall . Yet the psychological space is powerful , very powerful , and overwhelms him . He feels very far from Shinjuku , from Tokyo , from anything . He smells Laney 's sweat . " You are not well . " " Rydell , " Laney says , replacing the eyephones . " That rent-a-cop from the Chateau . The one you knew . The one who told me about you , back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need a man on the ground , in San Francisco . I 've managed to move some money . I do n't think they can trace it . I dicked with DatAmerica 's banking sector . Find Rydell and tell him he can have it as a retainer . " " To do what ? " Laney shakes his head . The cables on the eyephones move in the dark like snakes . " He has to be there , is all . Something 's coming down . Everything 's changing . " " Laney , you are sick . Let me take you " " Back to the island ? There 's nothing there . Never will be , now she 's gone . " And Yamazaki knows this is true . " Where 's Rez ? " Laney asks . " He mounted a tour of the Kombinat states , when he decided she was gone . " Laney nods thoughtfully , the eyephones bobbing mantis-like in the dark . " Get Rydell , Yamazaki . I 'll tell you how he can get the money . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Part of the node . " LATER Yamazaki stands , staring up at the towers of Shinjuku , the walls of animated light , sign and signifier twisting toward the sky in the unending ritual of commerce , of desire . Vast faces fill the screens , icons of a beauty at once terrible and banal . Somewhere below his feet , Laney huddles and coughs in his cardboard shelter , all of DatAmerica pressing steadily into his eyes . Laney is his friend , and his friend is unwell . The American 's peculiar talents with data are the result of experimental trials , in a federal orphanage in Florida , of a substance known as 5-SB . Yamazaki has seen what Laney can do with data , and what data can do to Laney . He has no wish to see it again . As he lowers his eyes from the walls of light , the mediated faces , he feels his contacts move , changing as they monitor his depth of focus . This still unnerves him . Not far from the station , down a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of kiosk that sells anonymous debit cards . He purchases one . At another kiosk , he uses it to buy a disposable phone good for a total of thirty minutes , TokyoLA . He asks his notebook for Rydell 's number , Chapter Two LUCKY DRAGON " HEROIN , " declared Durius Walker , Rydell 's colleague in security at the Lucky Dragon on Sunset . " It 's the opiate of the masses . " Durius had finished sweeping up . He held the big industrial dustpan carefully , headed for the inbuilt hospital-style sharps container , the one with the barbed biohazard symbol . That was where they put the needles , when they found them . They averaged five or six a week . Rydell had never actually caught anyone shooting anything up , in the store , although he would n't have put it past them . It just seemed like people dropped used needles on the floor , usually back by the cat food . You could find other things , sweeping up in the Lucky Dragon : pills , foreign coins , hospital identification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Not that you wanted to go poking around in that dustpan . When Rydell swept up , he wore the same Kevlar gloves that Durius was wearing now , and latex underneath that . He supposed Durius was right though , and it made you wonder : all the new substances around to abuse , but people did n't forget the ones that had been around forever . Make cigarettes illegal , say , and people found a way to keep smoking . The Lucky Dragon was n't allowed to sell rolling papers , but they did a brisk trade in Mexican hair-curler papers that worked just as well . The most popular brand was called Biggerhair , and Rydell wondered if anyone had ever actually used any to curl their hair . And how did you curl your hair with little rectangles of tissue paper anyway ? " Ten minutes to , " Durius said over his shoulder . " You wan na do the curb check ? " At four o'clock , one of them got to take a ten-minute break , out back . If Rydell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take his break first , then let Durius take one . The curb check was something that Lucky Dragon 's parent corporation , back in Singapore , had instituted on the advice of an in-house team of American cultural anthropologists . Mr. Park , the night manager , had explained this to Rydell , ticking off points on his notebook . He 'd tapped each paragraph on the screen for emphasis , sounding thoroughly bored with the whole thing , but Rydell had supposed it was part of the job , and Mr. Park was a definite stickler . " In order to demonstrate Lucky Dragon 's concern with neighborhood safety , security personnel will patrol curb in front of location on a nightly basis . ' " Rydell had nodded . " You not out of store too long , " Mr. Park added , by way of clarification . " Five minute . Just before you take break . " Pause . Tap . " Lucky Dragon security presence will be high-profile , friendly , sensitive to local culture . ' " " What 's that mean ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Hooker working there , you say hello , tell joke , make her move . " " I 'm scared of those old girls , " Rydell said , deadpan . " Christmastime , they dress up like Santa 's elves . " " No hooker in front of Lucky Dragon . " " Sensitive to local culture ' ? " " Tell joke . Hooker like joke . " " Maybe in Singapore , " Durius had said , when Rydell had recounted Park 's instructions . " He 's not from Singapore , " Rydell had said . " He 's from Korea . " " So basically they want us to show ourselves , clear the sidewalk back a few yards , be friendly and sensitive ? " " And tell joke . " Durius squinted . " You know what kinda people hang in front of a convenience store on Sunset , four in the morning ? Kids on dancer , tweaked off their dimes , hallucinating monster movies . Guess who gets to be the monster ? Plus there 's your more mature sociopaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Say what ? " " Mix their shit , " Durius said . " Get lateral . " " Got ta be done . Man says . " Durius looked at Rydell . " You first . " He was from Compton , and the only person Rydell knew who had actually been born in Los Angeles . " You 're bigger . " " Size ai n't everything . " " Sure , " Rydell had said . ALL that summer Rydell and Durius had been night security at the Lucky Dragon , a purpose-built module that had been coptered into this former car-rental lot on the Strip . Before that , Rydell had been night security at the Chateau , just up the street , and before that he 'd driven a wagon for IntenSecure . Still farther back , briefly and he tried not to think about it too often , he 'd been a police officer in Knoxville , Tennessee . Somewhere in there , twice , he 'd almost made the cut for Cops in Trouble , a show he 'd grown up on but now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dragon was more interesting than Rydell would have imagined . Durius said that was because it was the only place around , for a mile or so , that sold anything that anyone actually needed , on a regular basis or otherwise . Microwave noodles , diagnostic kits for most STDs , toothpaste , disposable anything , Net access , gum , bottled water ... There were Lucky Dragons all over America , all over the world for that matter , and to prove it you had your trademark Lucky Dragon Global Interactive Video Column outside . You had to pass it entering and leaving the store , so you 'd see whichever dozen Lucky Dragons the Sunset franchise happened to be linked with at that particular moment : Paris or Houston or Brazzaville , wherever . These were shuffled , every three minutes , for the practical reason that it had been determined that if the maximum viewing time was any more , kids in the world 's duller suburbs would try to win bets by having sex on camera . As it was , you got a certain amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like this shit-faced guy in downtown Prague , as Rydell made his exit to do the curb check , displaying the universal finger . " Same here , " Rydell said to this unknown Czech , hitching up the neon-pink Lucky Dragon fanny pack he was contractually obligated to wear on duty . He did n't mind that though , even if it did look like shit : it was bulletproof , with a pull-up Kevlar baby bib to fasten around your neck if the going got rough . A severely lateral customer with a ceramic switchblade had tried to stab Rydell through the Lucky Dragon logo his second week on the job , and Rydell had sort of bonded with the thing after that . He had that switchblade up in his room over Mrs. Siekevitz 's garage . They 'd found it below the peanut butter , after the LAPD had taken the lateral one away . It had a black blade that looked like sandblasted glass . Rydell did n't like it ; the ceramic blade gave it a weird balance , and it was so sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was n't sure what he should do with it . Tonight 's curb check looked dead simple . There was a Japanese girl standing out there with a seriously amazing amount of legs running down from an even more amazingly small amount of shorts . Well , sort of Japanese . Rydell found it hard to make distinctions like that in LA . Durius said hybrid vigor was the order of the day , and Rydell guessed he was right . This girl with all the legs , she was nearly as tall as Rydell , and be did n't think Japanese people usually were . But then maybe she 'd grown up here , and her family before her , and the local food had made them taller . He 'd heard about that happening . But , no , he decided , getting closer , the thing was , she was n't actually a girl . Funny how you got that . Usually it was n't anything too obvious . It was like he really wanted to buy into everything she was doing to be a girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure just would n't let him . " Hey , " he said . " You want me to move ? " " Well , " Rydell said , " I 'm supposed to . " " I 'm supposed to stand out here convincing a jaded clientele to buy blow jobs . What 's the difference ? Rydell thought about it . " You 're freelance . " he decided , " I 'm on salary . You go on down the street for twenty minutes , nobody 's going to fire you . " He could smell her perfume through the complicated pollution and that ghostly hint of oranges you got out here sometimes . There were orange trees around , had to be , but he 'd never found one . She was frowning at him , " Freelance . " " That 's right . " She swayed expertly on her stacked heels , fishing a box of Russian Marlboros from her pink patent purse . Passing cars were already honking at the sight of the Lucky Dragon security man talking to this six-foot-plus boygirl , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the red-and-white box and pointedly offered Rydell a cigarette . There were two in there , factory-made filter tips , but one was shorter than the other and had blue metallic lipstick on it . " No thanks . " She took out the shorter one , partially smoked , and put it between her lips . " Know what I 'd do if I were you ? " Her lips , around the tan filter tip , looked like a pair of miniature water beds plastered with glittery blue candy coat . " What ? " She took a lighter from her purse . Like the ones they sold in those tobacciana shops . They were going to make that illegal too , he 'd heard . She snapped it and lit her cigarette . Drew in the smoke , held it , blew it out , away from Rydell . " I 'd fuck off into the air . " He looked into the Lucky Dragon and saw Durius say something to Miss Praisegod Satansbane , the checker on this shift . She had a fine sense of humor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a name like that . Her parents were some particularly virulent stripe of SoCal NeoPuritan , and had taken the name Satansbane before Praisegod had been born . The thing was , she 'd explained to Rydell , nobody much knew what " bane " meant , so if she told people her last name , they mostly figured she was a Satanist anyway . So she often went by the surname Proby , which had been her father 's before he 'd gotten religion . Now Durius said something else , and Praisegod threw back her shoulders and laughed . Rydell sighed . He wished it had been Durius ' turn to do curb check . " Look , " Rydell said , " I 'm not telling you you ca n't stand out here . The sidewalk 's public property . It 's just that there 's this company policy . " " I 'm going to finish this cigarette , " she said , " and then I 'm calling my lawyer . " " Ca n't we just keep it simple ? " " Uh-uh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saw Durius making hand signals at him . Pointing to Praisegod , who held a phone . He hoped they had n't called LAPD . He had a feeling this girl really did have herself a lawyer , and Mr. Park would n't like that . Now Durius came out . " For you , " he called . " Say it 's Tokyo . " " Excuse me , " Rydell said , and turned away . " Hey , " she said . " Hey what ? " He looked back . " You 're cute . " Chapter Three DEEP IN LANEY hears his piss gurgle into the screw-top plastic liter bottle . It 's awkward kneeling here , in the dark , and he does n't like the way the bottle warms in his hand , filling . He caps it by feel and stands it upright in the corner that 's farthest from his head when he sleeps . In the morning , he 'll carry it under his coat to the Men 's and empty it . The old man knows he 's too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every time , but they have this agreement . Laney pisses in the bottle and takes it out when he can . He does n't know why the old man lets him stay here . He 's offered to pay , but the old man just keeps building his models . It takes him a day to complete one , and they 're always perfect . And where do they go when he finishes them ? And where do the unbuilt kits come from ? Laney has a theory that the old man is a sensei of kit-building , a national treasure , with connoisseurs shipping in kits from around the world , waiting anxiously for the master to complete their vintage Gundams with his unequaled yet weirdly casual precision , his Zen moves , perhaps leaving each one with a single minute and somehow perfect flaw , at once his signature and a recognition of the nature of the universe . How nothing is perfect , really . Nothing ever finished . Everything is process , Laney assures himself , zipping up , settling back into his squalid nest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger than he ever bargained for , he reflects bunching a fold of sleeping bag to pillow his head against the cardboard , through which he can feel the hard tile wall of the corridor . Still , he thinks , he needs to be here . If there 's any place in Tokyo Rez 's people wo n't find him , this is it . He 's not quite sure how he got here ; things got a little fuzzy around the time the syndrome kicked in . Some kind of state change , some global shift in the nature of his perception . Insufficient memory . Things had n't stuck . Now he wonders if in fact he did make some deal with the old man . Maybe he 's already covered this , the rent , whatever . Maybe that 's why the old man gives him food and bottles of flat mineral water and tolerates the smell of piss . He thinks that might be it , but he is n't sure . It 's dark in here , but he sees colors , faint flares and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the DatAmerica flows are permanent now , retinally ingrained . No light penetrates from the corridor outsidehe 's blocked every pinhole with black tapeand the old man 's halogen is off . He assumes the old man sleeps there , but he 's never seen him do it , never heard any sounds that might indicate a transition from model-building to sleep . Maybe the old man sleeps upright on his mat , Gundam in one hand , brush in the other . Sometimes he can hear music from the adjacent cartons , but it 's faint , as though the neighbors use earphones . He has no idea how many people live here in this corridor . It looks as though there might be room for six , but he 's seen more , and it may be that they shelter here in shifts . He 's never learned much Japanese , not after eight months , and even if he could understand , he guesses , these people are all crazy , and they 'd only talk about the things crazy people talk about . And of course anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his sleeping bags , his eyephones and his cellular data port and his bottle of cooling piss , would think he was crazy too . But he is n't . He knows he is n't , in spite of everything . He has the syndrome now , the thing that came after every test subject from that Gainesville orphanage , but he is n't crazy . Just obsessed . And the obsession has its own shape in his head , its own texture , its own weight . He knows it from himself , can differentiate , so he goes back to it whenever he needs to and checks on it . Monitors it . Makes sure it still is n't him . it reminds him of having a sore tooth , or the way he felt once when he was in love and did n't warn to be . How his tongue always found the tooth , or how he 'd always find that ache , that absence in the shape of the beloved . But the syndrome was n't like that . It was separate from him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laney , was even interested in . When he 'd felt it starting , he 'd taken it for granted that it would be about her , about Rei Toei , because there he was , close to her , or as close as you could get to anyone who did n't physically exist . They 'd talked almost every day , Laney and the idoru . And at first , he considered now , maybe it had been about her , but then it was as though he 'd been following something back through the data flows , doing it without really thinking about it , the way your hand will find a thread on a garment and start pulling at it , unraveling it . And what had unraveled was the way he 'd thought the world worked . And behind that he 'd found Harwood , who was famous , but famous in that way of being famous for being famous . Harwood who they said had elected the president . Harwood the PR genius , who 'd inherited Harwood Levine , the most powerful PR firm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , into a whole other realm of influence . But who 'd managed somehow never to become prey to the mechanism of celebrity itself . Which grinds , Laney so well knew , exceedingly fine . Harwood who , maybe , just maybe , ran it all , but somehow managed never to get his toe caught in it . Who managed , somehow , to be famous without seeming to be important , famous without being central to anything . Really , he 'd never even gotten much attention , except when he 'd split with Maria Paz , and even then it had been the Padanian star who 'd made the top of every sequence , with Cody Harwood smiling from a series of sidebars , embedded hypertext lozenges : the beauty and this gentle-looking , secretive , pointedly uncharismatic billionaire . " Hello , " Laney says , his fingers finding the handle of a mechanical flashlight from Nepal , a crude thing , its tiny generator driven by a mechanism like a pair of spring-loaded pliers . Pumping it to life , he raises it , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastered , inch by inch , with dozens of stickers , small and rectangular , produced to order by a vending machine inside the station 's west entrance : each one a different shot of the reclusive Harwood . He ca n't remember going to the machine , executing a simple image search for Harwood , and paying to have these printed out , but he supposes he must have . Because he knows that that is where they are from . But neither can he remember peeling the adhesive backing from each one and sticking them up on the ceiling . But someone did . " I see you , " Laney says and relaxes his hand , letting the dim beam brown and vanish . Chapter Four FORMAL ABSENCES OF PRECIOUS THINGS IN Market Street , the nameless man who haunts Laney 's nodal configuration has just seen a girl . Drowned down three decades , she steps fresh as creation from the bronze doors of some brokerage . And he remembers , in that instant , that she is dead , and he is not , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl , some newly minted stranger , one with whom he will never speak . And passing this one now , through a faint chromatic mist of incoming night , he bows his head some subtle increment in honor of that other , that earlier passing . And sighs within his long coat , and the harness he wears beneath that : a taking in and giving up of one resigned breath , thronged around by the traders descending from their various places of employment . Who continue to emerge into the October street , toward drink or dinner or whatever home , whatever sleep , awaits them . But now the one with whom he will not speak is gone as well , and he awash in some emotion , not loss exactly but a very particular awareness of his own duration in the world and in its cities , and this one most of all . Beneath his right arm , reliably concealed , depends a knife that sleeps head down , like a vampire bat , honed to that edge required by surgeons , when surgeons cut with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a simple hilt of nickel silver . The blade 's angled tip , recalling a wood carver 's chisel , inclines toward the dark arterial pulse in the pit of his arm , as if reminding him that he too is only ever inches from that place the drowned girl went , so long ago , that timelessness . That other country , waiting . He is by trade a keeper of the door to that country . Drawn , the black blade becomes a key . When he holds it , he holds the wind in his hand . The door swings gently open . But he does not draw it now , and the traders see only a gray-haired man , wolfishly professorial , in a coat of grayish green , the color of certain lichens , who blinks behind the fine gold rims of his small round glasses and raises his hand to halt a passing cab . Though somehow they do not , as they easily might , rush to claim it as their own , and the man steps past them , his cheeks seamed vertically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit frequently to smile . They do not see him smile . THE Tao , he reminds himself , mired in traffic on Post Street , is older than God . He sees a beggar seated beneath a jeweler 's windows . In those windows are small empty pedestals , formal absences of precious things , locked away now for the night . The beggar has wrapped his legs and feet in brown paper tape , and the effect is startlingly medieval , as though someone has partially sculpted a knight from office materials . The trim calves , the tapered toes , an elegance calling out for ribbons . Above the tape , the man is a blur , a spastic scribble , his being abraded by concrete and misfortune . He has become the color of pavement , his very race in question . The cab lurches forward . The man in the loden coat reaches within it to adjust the knife against his ribs . He is left-handed , and he has thought often about such subtle polarities . The girl who drowned so long ago has settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and less hurtful memories , to where his youth turns gently , in its accustomed tides , and he is more comfortable that way . The past is past , the future unformed . There is only the moment , and that is where he prefers to be . And now he leans forward , to rap , once , upon the driver 's tinted safety shield . He asks to be taken to the bridge . THE cab draws up before a rain-stained tumble of concrete tank traps , huge rhomboids streaked with rust , covered with the stylized initials of forgotten lovers .
