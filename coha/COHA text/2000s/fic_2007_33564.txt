Chapter One Portland , Oregon , March 2006 " So , I 'm stuck , is that what you 're saying ? " Kristen balanced her cell phone between her ear and shoulder as she leaned back in her desk chair and felt a headache coming on . Though time was definitely running out , she 'd held out hope that her friend Aurora had found someone else to be in charge of the damned twenty-year reunion . " No one 's willing to take over the job ? " " You were the valedictorian . If you did n't want to head up the reunion , you should have gotten at least one B , okay ? Like in PE or calculus or something . " Aurora Zephyr laughed at her own joke and Kristen imagined her toothy smile and knowing hazel eyes . Aurora was the one student at St. Elizabeth 's that she 'd really kept up with over the years . " If I 'd known this was coming up , I would have . " " Fat chance . Now give up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Yeah , right . " " What 's got into you ? There was a time when you knew how to have a good time . Remember ? " " Good time ... " Kristen murmured skeptically . " You 're just going to organize a big party for kids you knew way back when . Get into it , would ya ? " Kristen sighed and leaned toward her desk . " It 's just that I 've tried to avoid anything to do with St. Elizabeth 's . " " I know.Because of Jake . We all feel that way . But it 's been twenty years , for God 's sake . Time to get over it . Bury the past and lighten up . " " I can try . " " Hallelujah and amen , sister , " Aurora said and Kristen smiled . " I 've already rounded up quite a few volunteers , " Aurora added . " Remember Haylie Swanson ? " That psycho who believed that Jake killed Ian Powers ? She was n't likely to forget . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mandy Kim . Her last name is Stulz now . " Mandy Kim . Another girl Kristen had n't trusted in high school . " We 've got a few others who will show up . I just told everyone to spread the word . The more people involved , the better . I even called Lindsay Farrell and Rachel Alsace , but they both live too far away to help out . " " I know . " Kristen still received annual newsy Christmas cards from the women who were supposed to have been her best friends . " Lindsay 's some hotshot event planner in New York and Rachel 's ... geez , wait a minute ... I know this ... " " She 's in Alabama . A cop . " " That 's right , " Aurora agreed slowly . " Like her old man . He was with the Portland Police Department for years . " Kristen felt the muscles in the back of her neck tense . Mac Alsace had been one of the detectives who had worked on the Jake Marcott murder . Despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Cupid Killer " case had ultimately gone cold . Kristen had heard that Detective Alsace 's inability to solve the murder of his kid 's friend had driven him to an early retirement . Jake Marcott 's ghost haunted them all . Kristen had n't seen either Lindsay or Rachel since graduation . She remembered them in their caps and gowns , all surface smiles and unexplained tears . The day had been warm for June ; Kristen had sweated as she waited to give her valedictorian speech and later , accepted her diploma from Sister Neva , the Reverend Mother . After the ceremony , she 'd found Lindsay and Rachel . They 'd hugged , posed for pictures , and sworn to keep in touch , but they had n't . Not in that first summer before college , not afterward . Because of Jake . So many things had changed , because of Jake . Kristen leaned forward in her chair to watch the aquarium screen saver on her computer monitor where an angelfish was being chased through lengths of sea grass by a darting neon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reunion , not me . " " No way . You 're not weaseling out of it ! I figured I could jump-start it for you , but the reunion is your baby . " " Fine , " Kristen capitulated . " Why not ? Believe it or not , I 've done some work . I 've got a couple of places who will cater , if we really elect to have it at St. Elizabeth 's . " " It 's perfect . We were the last all-girls class to graduate and now the school is closing . It would be weird to hold it anywhere else . I did a quick poll of the first few classmates I contacted and the general consensus is to hold the reunion at the school . " " If you say so . " " Good . I 'm sending you an e-mail with an attachment . It 's everything I 've done to date . From there on in , you 're in charge . See you in a couple of hours . " " You got it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impending headache , then buried herself in her work , effectively putting anything to do with St. Elizabeth 's out of her head as she polished a human interest story about a man and dog who had spent a year walking from Missouri to Oregon via the Oregon Trail . Once she 'd e-mailed the story to her editor , she glanced up from her cubicle . The Elvis clock mounted on the temporary wall over her desk swivelled its hips . As the clock kept time , the King 's hands moved around the old-fashioned dial . Right now , Elvis was pointing out that it was nearly six and Kristen , as usual , was running late . She checked her e-mail , found the note from Aurora , and printed out an Excel file which contained more information than she 'd ever want on her classmates . Slinging her purse strap over her shoulder , Kristen stood up and stretched . She 'd been allotted this cubicle while one of the newspaper 's more roomy offices was being remodeled . She 'd been with the Portland Clarion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office-a dubious honor given that it felt as if the " higher-ups " scarcely noticed her . " I 'm outta here . " Kristen closed her laptop , placing it and her Excel printout inside her computer briefcase . " Big date tonight ? " Sabrina Lacey asked , two cubicles over , as she tossed back the remainder of her double espresso , then crumpled the paper cup in her long fingers and discarded the remains into her wastebasket . " Yeah , right . " Kristen scrounged in her purse for her keys and , once the huge ring was found , headed for the door . Sabrina joined her as she wended her way through the labyrinthine desks , tables , and chairs of the Clarion 's newsroom . It had been her first job out of college , the one she thought she 'd use as a stepping stone to bigger and brighter newspapers . Though her position had changed over the years-stretching , evolving , mutating-it said something she was n't sure she wanted to examine that she was still here . " You should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cornrows , and metal jewelry , insisted . " Find a guy . Have some fun . " " I 'm married , remember ? " " You 're separated , have been for a year , and last I heard , you were going to divorce Ross 's ass . " Sabrina arched a perfect eyebrow . " I know , I know . It 's just hard . " " Nuh-uh . I 've done it three times . " " Maybe it 'll get easier after the first one . " " You 'll never know unless you try . " Sabrina stopped at the hallway leading to the restrooms . " I 've got a kid , " Kristen reminded her . " Who 's nearly grown . " Kristen snorted . " Sixteen does not an adult make . " " You tell her that ? " " Every day . Besides , I do happen to have a date tonight , only it 's with half a dozen women I have n't seen in twenty years . I got drafted into heading the damned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drafted , " Kristen stressed . " I did n't volunteer . " Sabrina wrinkled her long nose . " Ca n't you go AWOL ? " " I 'm hoping to pawn the duties off on someone more deserving tonight . " " Good luck . " Sabrina laughed and moseyed down the hall . Kristen shoved open the glass doors of the newspaper offices and a blast of frigid air , smelling of the river and exhaust , rolled toward her . Dark clouds gathered over the spires of Portland 's highest buildings , and as she hurried the two blocks to the parking lot where her beat-up Honda was waiting , the sky opened up . Flipping up the hood of her jacket , Kristen made a mad dash to her Honda . The car looked as tired as she felt , and the fun was just beginning . Kristen shook her head in disbelief . For her , high school had ended that night at the Valentine 's Day dance . The remainder of the school year had been a blur that had n't become clearer with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being valedictorian of the class was that she got to organize the class reunion . She 'd managed to duck this responsibility for nearly twenty years , but no more . Aurora was making certain that this anniversary of the graduating class of ' 86 would be celebrated . The only good news was the hope that she could pass the baton for the next reunion . If there was one ... Sliding behind the wheel , she rummaged in her purse for her cell phone . Starting the Honda with one hand , she speed dialed her home number with the other . On the second ring , as she turned on the wipers , her answering machine clicked on . " Lissa ? " she said as soon as the recorded message beeped at her . " If you 're there , answer , okay ? " A pause . Nothing . " Lissa , are you home ? " But there was no breathless response ; no sound of her daughter 's voice . Obviously she was n't home . " Listen , if you get this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty minutes . " She clicked off , punched in the number of her daughter 's cell phone , and heard , " Hi , this is Lissa . You know what to do . Leave your number and , if you 're lucky , I 'll call you back . " Kristen hung up . Her daughter was undoubtedly screening her calls . Caller ID could be such a pain . " Great , " she muttered under her breath as she nosed her car out of the lot and settled into the slow flow of traffic that oozed out of the downtown area . She was ticked that her daughter was n't home . Did n't that kid know what " You 're grounded " meant ? Hopefully , Lissa would show up before Kristen had to leave again , in what ? Less than an hour ? " Save me , " she whispered , thinking of the evening to come and the first of what would probably be a dozen meetings of the reunion committee . Never reaching a speed even close to twenty miles an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the steep , forested cliffs of the West Hills . Her route cut under the Vista Avenue Viaduct , more commonly referred to as the Suicide Bridge , and each time she passed under that arching eighty-year-old stone span , she thought of those who had leapt to their deaths on the very pavement on which she was driving . Shuddering , she watched the fat drops of rain drizzling down her windshield as she reached the turnoff leading to her house . She punched the accelerator and her little car climbed up the hill , along an impossibly winding side road that snaked through the stand of Douglas fir trees to the crest and the tiny dead-end lane that stopped at her house , a cedar-and-glass " Northwest Contemporary " that had been built in the 1970s and boasted a panoramic view of the city far below . Tonight she would have loved to throw on her most comfortable sweats , light the fire , and curl up by the windows with a good book . The last thing she wanted was to leave home again to deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exuberance to connect with friends , enemies , and unknowns after twenty years of virtual silence . Nothing sounded worse . As she reached her house , she suddenly realized how wrong she 'd been : the reunion meeting was not at the top of her " things I do n't want to do " list . That first , dreaded spot was reserved for dealing with her soon-to-be ex-husband . And it looked like she was about to have the pleasure of another face-off with him as well . Ross 's monster of a black pickup was blocking the drive . " Give me strength , " she silently prayed as she parked her car across the street . The day was quickly sliding from bad to real bad . " Perfect , " she muttered under her breath . She sent up another quick plea for patience in dealing with the man she 'd married during her sophomore year in college . It had been a rash , hasty decision , one she 'd come to regret . If not for their only child , the now " out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be considered a colossal mistake . She just had n't had the guts , heart , time , or energy to end it . Neither , it seemed , had he . No divorce papers had been filed . Yet . " More fun to come , " she whispered under her breath as she grabbed the mail from the box . With her orange tabby nearly tripping her , Kristen made her way through the open door of the garage , past the lawnmower , ladders , and recycling tubs to the door leading to her kitchen , where , big as life , Ross was seated at the nook caf table , sipping one of her light beers and reading the paper . Just as he 'd done thousands of times during their years together . Wearing a white shirt with the top two buttons undone , his sleeves rolled up , his tie tossed casually over the back of a chair , he scanned the business section . His wallet and keys were on the table . " Been here a while ? " she asked as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assessing . Her heart did a funny little glitch . Even after all the years , the fights , the differing paths of their lives , she still found him sexy . Her downfall . " I thought I 'd take Lissa to dinner . She has n't shown . " " Just like that ? " " Yeah . " She was stunned . " Did you consider calling ? " " Yep . " He took a swallow of his beer and leaned back in his chair to stare at her . " Thought better of it . " " Why ? " He lifted a shoulder . " I figured you might try to talk me out of it . Or , if I got your okay , then I 'd have to go through the whole thing all over again . This seemed easier . " " So you just let yourself in ? " " Still own half of the house . Got my own set of keys . " Those damned eyes skewered her , challenging her to argue with him . Kristen decided not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time or energy to argue . " Where is she ? " " I thought you 'd know . " He stretched , his shoulders and arms tugging at the seams of his shirt , the black hair at his nape a little too long and ruffling over his shirt collar . Uneasiness crawled through Kristen 's blood . " Lissa was supposed to come home straight after school . " " You told her that ? " " Oh , yes . " The ugly scene this morning was fresh in her mind . They 'd argued , the gist of it being that Lissa was furious with her mother for finding the progress reports from the school . Even though the envelope had been addressed to Mr. and Mrs. Ross Delmonico , Lissa had considered the contents about her failing grades to be no one 's business but her own . She 'd thrown a fit and refused breakfast . Her eyes , so like her father 's , had snapped gray fire and she 'd half run out of the house to catch a ride with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports from her school , " Kristen explained . Ross waited , eyebrows raised , for Kristen to continue . " She 's flunking chemistry and German . " Kristen picked up the progress reports from the dining room table and handed them to him . " Flunking ? " he said , eyeing the page with the teacher comments . " She claims it 's all a big mistake , that the teachers have n't entered a couple of grades , so I told her to get everything fixed and have Mrs. Hanson and Mr. Childers call me , send me notes , or e-mail me . So far , I have n't heard from either teacher , so I figure until the grades are up , she 's going nowhere . " " Is n't that a little Dickensian ? " " You got a better idea ? " She did n't need a lesson in parenting from a man who for years was a ghost in the marriage , spending all of his waking hours working . When Ross did n't reply , she said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to school with Zeke ? " Kristen nodded , and Ross said maddeningly , " Does n't sound much like grounding to me . " " I was running late and- " Kristen stopped short , clenching her teeth . She glared at him . " Why am I explaining this to you ? It 's not like you were around to drive her . " " Your decision , not mine , " he reminded her in that irritating way of his . That much was true . She 'd asked him to move out and he 'd complied . Now he shifted on the chair to face her and she noticed the square cut of his jaw , still as strong as it had been when she 'd met him nearly twenty years ago . " Okay , let 's not go there . The blame game does n't really work . " " Agreed . " Damn the man . Was that a twinkle in his gray eyes ? Was he finding some humor in this impossible situation ? (         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
