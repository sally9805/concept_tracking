New hybrids make America 's native lupines possible in home gardens Photograph Above : Lupines form a dense springtime carpet outside an old house in Maine , where they have been allowed to colonize at will . Below , left : Tall , spiky flower clusters bloom from the bottom up , advertising the plant 's charms to pollinating insects . Below : By adding height to indoor arrangements . lupines make outstanding cut flowers . Cut stalks should be placed in warm water , as it contains less air than cold water and will make its way up the stem faster . // In Texas , they 're called bluebonnets ( Lupinus texensis ) and come spring they transform broad green grasslands into oceans of dazzling deep purple . Out West , where folks know them as Nebraska lupines ( L. plattensis ) , the perky onefooters lend endearing charm to Wyoming 's stream banks and Colorado 's rocky slopes . In Maine , lupines blanket entire fields for a few short weeks in May , when the elegant fourfoot spires of pink , blue , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . No matter what their geographical guise , all lupines are members of the same clan : Fabaceae , the pea family . And whether you spell the name " lupine " or " lupin , " you pronounce it " loo-pin , " says Ann Gibbs , who should know . As Maine 's state horticulturist , Ann notes with delight that each year ever-larger colonies of the flower populate inland as well as along coastal roadsides . The richly hued racemes send hearts racing , and the flowers cross-pollinate freely , making it difficult to ascertain the precise species that paint Maine 's springtime landscape , Ms. Gibbs says . Most likely , both L. perennis and L. polyphyllus are mixed into the genetic stew . Down East , where Hilda Hamlin ( see " The Lupine Lady " on page 94 ) broadcast pounds and pounds of imported seed in the 1950s and ' 60s , descendants of English hybrids may also play a part in the annual fireworks . America 's wild lupines thrive wherever the soil is gravelly and the sunshine bright . Although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nutrients ( " lupine " comes from lupinus , Latin for " wolflike " ) , lupines-as do all legumesactually help restore nitrogen to depleted soil . And while the ancients ( Puny the Elder , for one ) sometimes ate the nutritious seeds ( made less bitter when soaked in water or wine ) , snacking is not a good idea : The plants can be poisonous . Those who contract acute lupinosis , as the condition is called , experience cramps and , in rare cases , respiratory failure . Cattle and pigs can munch lupines without apparent consequences , but horses and sheep may suffer liver damage and chronic indigestion . This is why wranglers out West are forever reminding dudes to please prevent their horses from stopping midtrail for a quick bite of the tasty-looking wildflowers . Photograph Top : America 's native lupine species bloom in dreamy shades of blue , lavender , rose , and cream .

While not as long-lived as species lupines , gardeners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The annual lupines enjoyed in Caesar 's time hailed from the Mediterranean . Perennial lupines , by contrast , arrived in Europe from North America , where British plant hunters ( among them John Tradescant , Jr. , Peter Kalm , and David Douglas ) found them irresistible . By the time Victoria ascended the throne , no English cottage garden was considered complete without a stand or two of L. polyphyllus . While undoubtedly picturesque , as cultivated flowers these garden lupines were hardly perfect . Too often , blossoms at the base of the flower spike faded and died before those at the top had begun to show their colors . In 191 I , an amateur hybridizer from Yorkshire named George Russell ( 1857-1951 ) set out to fix the problem , and by 1937 he had done just that . Russell lupines , as the hybrids ( a cross between L. polphyllus and L. arboreus ) are now known , come in rainbow hues and bicolors , and their entire central stalk blooms at once . Moreover , they make outstanding cut flowers . Mr. Russell 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Society and have been drawing raves ever since . Gardeners are sometimes tempted to transplant lupines from the wild into their own beds and borders . In addition to being environmentally unsound and frequently illegal , pilferage almost never works . " The taproot of a lupine is too long and fragile , " explains Maine 's Ann Gibbs . " As soon as you damage the taproot even slightly , the plant is doomed . " A better bet is to sow your own lupines from seed . Here 's how : 1 CHOOSE A CULTIVAR . Readily available Russell hybrids come in knockout colors , including yellow and orange . A new dwarf strain , called ' Gallery ' , requires no staking . Bluebonnets ( a new red form has just come on the market ) and seed for other wild lupines are also available by mail . ( Please see the Shopping Guide . ) Gardeners in warm regions ( Zones 7 and south ) will want to consider six-foot tree lupines ( L. arboreus ) , capable of withstanding high temperatures . 2 HASTEN GERMINATION by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a legume inoculant helps ward off mildew and fungal diseases . 3 SOW SEEDS INDOORS IN PEAT POTS . After all danger of frost has passed , you 'll be able to set the entire pot in the ground and leave the seedlings ' fragile roots undisturbed . 4 PREPARE THE SOIL . While lupines planted in Zones 8 and 9 appreciate a little afternoon shade , plants in colder zones require full sun . Acid-loving lupines ca n't tolerate lime , so be careful when choosing a fertilizer . In fact , when raised in average , deeply dug , well-drained soil enriched with compost , lupines do n't require any fertilizer . 5 KEEP CROWNS DRY IN WINTER . Do n't allow water and ice to collect at the base of hybrids , as plants may rot . 6 SOW FRESH SEED ANNUALLY . Because Russell lupines are notoriously short-lived , stock should be replenished regularly . Established plants may be divided by separating side shoots from the mother plant , but extreme care must be taken not to damage roots . THE LUPINE LADY Inspired by Hilda Hamlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hybrid lupines to Maine 's coastline , Miss Rumphius ( Viking ; $15.99 , by Barbara Cooney , tells the story of a young girl who grows up determined to " make the world more beautiful , " but is unsure as to how to achieve her goal . After traveling to faraway places , she returns to her beloved Maine and takes up residence in a house by the sea . In this classic storybook , children and adults enjoy following the progress of Miss Rumphius , Who soon discovers the power of lupines. // SHOPPING GUIDE // <p>
