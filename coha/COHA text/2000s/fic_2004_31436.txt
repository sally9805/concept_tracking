Camp David , Catoctin Mountain , Maryland " What are we doing here ? " Laurel Stewart asked the man sitting next to her in the sanctuary of the presidential retreat 's Evergreen Chapel . " Praying for peace ? " Max Kelly , a reporter from the Boston Globe , suggested . " Granted , it 's an admirable goal , but given that the Weather Service has declared this the hottest summer on record , what made the White House decide that August would be a good time to hold another round of Middle East Road to Peace meetings ? Could n't the State Department find a road map that leads to Maine ? " She slapped at yet another mosquito that had sneaked in through the window screen . " And how come they all invited us here to participate ? " She had to raise her voice to be heard over the huge pipe organ 's rendition of " The Song of Peace . " According to her program , Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin had sung the song with over a hundred thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his assassination . " This from the reporter who 's always bitching that we do n't get enough access when the president hides out at Camp David ? " " Like you think anyone 's going to nail down a scoop here today , " Laurel scoffed . Her dark auburn hair , styled in a sleek , no-nonsense cut that ended at her earlobes , hinted at a redhead 's temper she usually kept tightly controlled . Her eyes were a cool , intelligent green in a pale complexion , her nose was straight , her mouth generous , and her chin as stubborn as she herself was . " We 're being herded around the place like a bunch of senior citizens on an **41;1090;TOOLONG bus tour from hell . " " Hey , it 's not every day you can watch two world leaders knocking down ten pins in the Nixon bowling alley . " " Bowling for Peace , " she muttered . " Now , that 's going to catch on . I 'm still trying to find out if those were new shoes they gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Go get ' em , Lois Lane . That story 's bound to get you a banner headline . " " That 's my point , Max . There is no story here . At least nothing new , other than their refusal to release the president 's scorecard and the chef 's diplomatic faux pas of serving sun-dried tomatoes with the beef tenderloin . I mean , really , no one 's eaten sun-dried tomatoes since the Clinton Administration . " " I thought they ate Big Macs . " " Cute . " Actually , a big , juicy cheeseburger with fries sounded a lot better than the uninspired deli spread of sliced cheese and cold meat that had been laid out for reporters in the mess hall . " It 's an evil plot cooked up by the politicos to do away with us . " She felt the sting at the back of her neck and slapped again , an instant too late . " The gang in the White House is probably hoping all of us nuisances in the press corps will be attacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead before the election . " Unfortunately , the organ player wearing Marine dress blues chose that moment to pound out the last chord , which left Laurel 's conspiracy theory hanging on the steamy air . The president and First Lady , displaying impeccable manners in the front row , did not turn around . Neither did the prime minister . Her peers were not as polite . Pretending vast interest in the flags on either side of the linen-draped altar at the front of the chapel , Laurel ignored their evil grins . Two hours later , she was back in the Clinton Room at the Cozy Country Inn in nearby Thurmont , soaking in the Jacuzzi tub , when her cell phone started playing the theme from Jaws . Buh dum . Buh dum . " No one 's home . " She took a long swallow of the frozen margarita she 'd brought up from the pub and savored the icy tartness . Buh dum . Buh dum . " Undoubtedly some jokers wanting to rag me about my big mouth . " Journalism was a blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been Max who 'd jammed his Bruno Magli into his mouth . Dum dum dum dum . Some people might be able to ignore a ringing phone . Laurel was not one of them . Splashing water onto the floor , she lunged for the cell phone she 'd left on the sink . " Oh , hell . " The caller screen identified her Washington Post editor . She punched Talk . " Yes , Barry , I 'm afraid it 's true , " she admitted , not bothering to waste time with hellos . " I insulted the entire White House in front of a foreign dignitary . You can probably read all about it in tomorrow 's Washington Times . " " That 's already old news , " he said , brushing off her ill-timed remark . " Do n't worry about it  --  I 'm not calling to chew you out . I wanted to see if you 've been keeping tabs on the AP wire . " " The Secret Service confiscated my computer and phone and held them hostage until we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and homeland security . " Laurel noticed she was dripping on the floor . " What 's up ? " she asked as she pulled down a towel and wrapped it around her body , which was draped in fragrant white froth from the bubble bath she 'd dumped into the tub . " That 's all they did ? " It was not unusual for Barry Yost to answer a question with a question . He was , after all , a newsman , more accustomed to delving for information than handing it out . " Yeah , which was too bad , " she answered , " because there 's this really cute , hot new agent I would n't mind being patted down by . " " Did they return your computer ? " " Of course . " For a moment she thought her phone had dropped the call . " Barry ? " she said into the silence of dead air . " Are you still there ? " " There 's been a leak . " " There are always leaks in Washington . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took a sip . " Which is probably why those Watergate guys were called plumbers . " " This one concerns the vice president . " " Do n't tell me someone else has my story . " The printed note that had landed on her desk from the confidential , obviously high-level source had promised exclusivity . The first article of a five-part series had run this morning . " Not exactly . " Silence descended again , thick and , this time , a little unnerving . " Not exactly ? " she coaxed , trying to ignore the little frisson of nerves that skimmed up her spine . " The vice president 's people are alleging that papers were stolen from their offices . " " That 's certainly not unheard of . " If the confidential report had been meant to be for public viewing , it would n't have had to be leaked . " Yeah , but ... shit . " Barry Yost was one of the most articulate men Laurel had ever met , which , in a city populated by glib-tongued politicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporters , was really saying something . She could n't recall ever hearing him at a loss for words . Until now . " The story has n't gone beyond rumor stage at this point , " he said . " But your name 's being floated around town as a suspect . " " A suspect ? " Laurel 's fingers tightened on the stem of the glass . " As in , someone thinks I 'm the person who stole the report ? " Her nerves began screeching like the civil defense siren Jamie Douglas continued to test once a year back in her hometown of Highland Falls on the Tennessee-North Carolina border . He blew out a breath . " Like I said , it 's just a rumor , but  --  " " Hold that thought . " An unmistakably authoritative knock had begun hammering on her door . Hopefully it was room service with the steak she 'd ordered . Oh , hell . It was n't . One look at the grim faces on the other side of the peephole and the idea of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrust-out jaw was wide enough to land Air Force One on , and who appeared neither as cute nor as hot as he had this morning  --  suddenly lost its appeal . " I 'll have to call you back , Barry . I 've got company . " The tart taste of lime and tequila turned coppery as Laurel tossed back the margarita , threw on a robe , sent a quick , abbreviated Hail Mary upward , then opened the door to face the inquisition .
