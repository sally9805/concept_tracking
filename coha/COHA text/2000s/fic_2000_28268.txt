1 . Lee July 13 , 1863 It was a high bluff , overlooking the dark violence of the swollen river . He sat alone , watched as the men fell into line and the columns began moving slowly through the steady rain . He felt the coolness run down his neck , the water soaking every part of him , his hat , his clothes . A vast sea of mud surrounded them all . The Potomac was rising again , was well beyond their ability to ford , as they might have done before the rains . Now , it was angry and swirling . In the darkness , the motion was accented by the small fires that lined the riverbank , a flickering protest to the misery of the weather , the only guiding light the men would have to reach the crossing . Lee straightened his back , stretched , pulled at the miserable wetness in his clothes . He reached down , patted Traveller gently , said quietly to the horse , " He has given us one more night ... he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meade , the commander of the vast Federal army he knew was encamped out there , somewhere , deep in the thick darkness . He had expected them to come at him well before now . It had been ten days , and Lee 's army had been strung out for miles , moving southwest away from Gettysburg . The army had begun the march away from the bloody fields in a terrible downpour , led away by the wagons of the wounded , and Meade had not pursued . But they reached the Potomac to find the river swollen nearly out of its banks , their one good bridge swept away , and so they would have to try to build another , or wait longer for the river to drop . When Meade had finally moved , he pushed his army in a more roundabout way , to come at them from downriver . But there was too much time , Lee 's men had fortified into a strong defensive line , and so Meade waited again . Lee had known the risk was enormous , and he feared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , small outbreaks of musket fire , the feeling out of two great armies close together . The only real assaults had been with cavalry , all along the march , the Federal horsemen thrusting and jabbing , while Stuart held them away from the main lines . When the skies finally cleared and the roads began to dry , Meade moved his army close , and Lee was backed hard against the high water . Now they had dug in , the quick work of men with shovels , because even the foot soldiers knew that they were trapped and a strong push from a healthy enemy could crush them . But Meade did not come . It was Major Harman , the foul-tempered and foul-mouthed quarter-master of Jackson 's old Second Corps , who saved the day . Lee smiled now , remembered Jackson 's embarrassment as Harman would ride by , screaming profanities at a line of slow moving wagons . Jackson would glance at Lee like a small boy expecting an angry response from a stern parent , and Lee would look away , would make no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man 's harsh outbursts because he was very good at his job . Now Harman was serving new commanders , and still did his job . He 'd scouted the countryside , found the abandoned houses and barns , the people far away from this invading army . Harman ordered the houses dismantled and the wood planking thrown into the river , swept downstream to where the engineers waited . The wood was collected and strung together into a snaking mass of ragged timber . They had laid tree branches across the planks , muffling the sounds of the wagons ' wheels , and now the ambulances and the guns and the weary soldiers were finally crossing the river . Lee still watched them , the glow from the fires throwing light and shadows on the faces , some looking up toward him , seeing him on the high knoll . But most stared straight ahead , looked silently at the back of the man in front , or down at the slow rhythm of bare feet , moving slowly , carefully , and they all knew they were marching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes and saw the sharp face , the brightness in the clear blue eyes . We miss you , General . No , do not think on that . He opened his eyes , looked around to his staff , saw Taylor , sitting with the others , a cluster of black raincoats . " Major , have we heard from General Ewell ? " Taylor moved up , pushed his horse through the mud close to Lee . " Yes , sir . He reports his men are crossing well . They should be south of the river by daylight . " Lee nodded , wanted to say more , to break away from the thoughts of Jackson , but the image was still there , would not go . Lee turned back toward the march of the men , felt the wetness again . Taylor waited , watched Lee , could sense his mood through the darkness , backed his horse away . Below , along the river , a group of horsemen moved out of the woods , and Lee saw the flag of the First Corps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved out in front and spurred his horse up the hill , broad thick shoulders slumped against the rain . The wind suddenly began to blow , the rain slicing across them , and the big man leaned into it , held his hat in place with a gloved hand . " General Longstreet ... " Longstreet looked up , peered from under the wide wet hat , nodded , saluted . " General Lee . We 're moving pretty quick , considering the conditions . The bridge may not hold . We 're watching it pretty close ... both sides of the river . " " It is a blessing , General . " Lee looked to the water again , the slow march of the troops . " Major Harman may have saved this army . " Longstreet followed Lee 's look , and for a moment the wind stopped and there was just the quiet sound of the rain . Suddenly , beyond the trees , there was a rumble , one sharp blast from a big gun . They waited for more , but the silence flowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Damned fools ... save your ammunition . " He looked toward Lee , lowered his head , did not like to swear in front of Lee , but Lee did not seem to notice , was again staring at the marching troops . Longstreet saw now that Lee was counting , nodding to the regimental flags as they caught the brief flickers from the fires . " We 'll make it all right , sir . If Meade has n't hit us by now , heis n't coming at all . Ewell is making good time down below , andthe First Corps is nearly all across . Hill 's corps is right behind us . " Lee nodded , looked now out in the darkness , to the far trees . " He should have hit us here . We gave him an opportunity . God ... gave him an opportunity . The rains slowed us , kept us here . Now , God has taken his opportunity away . " Lee paused , and Longstreet waited . Lee said , " I do n't understand His ways .... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Almighty was with us , the fight was ours ... we should have won the day . But it was not to be . I thought ... I understood . But now , He is allowing us to go back home . " Longstreet looked at Lee for a long moment , said , " I thought Meade would end it . He is making a mistake letting us escape . I suppose ... there will be another day . " Now there was the sharp sound of another gun , a brief flash of light in the trees far downriver , then another gun , closer , the reply . Lee watched , sat up straight . Longstreet said , " No musket fire . They 're just playing ... probably firing at the wind . Meade 's cavalry is moving around , but no infantry . They 're still in place . " Lee shook his head . " He dug trenches . He came right at us , and then dug trenches . " Longstreet said , " The scouts have been bringing in some numbers .... Word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than us . They lost some good people .... John Reynolds is dead , that 's for certain . I heard Hancock was down , and Dan Sickles . Meade 's still new to command , does n't want to make any mistakes . He won the fight , he knows it . Let those folks in Washington absorb that . They have n't had much to cheer about . " Lee looked at Longstreet , ran the names through his mind . " General , he has not lost what we have lost . We can not replace what has been taken from us , and this fight has taken too much . I do not understand why we have been ... punished so . We could have ended the war , right over there , if we had prevailed on that ground . The pressure on Washington ... we took the fight to them , it was the only way . And we have paid a terrible price . " He paused , said quietly , to himself , " I would have thought ... surely God does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops again , said , " There were many mistakes . " Lee did not answer , thought again of Jackson , closed his eyes , fought the image . But it would not go away . The image stared hard at him , and Lee knew that Jackson was there , had seen the great fight , the great bloody disaster . Lee thought , If you had been here ... if you had led them ... it would have been very different . From down below , one of Longstreet 's staff moved up the hill , said , " General , excuse me . The last of the corps is on the bridge , sir . General Hill 's column is forming on the road , behind those woods . " Longstreet turned , nodded . " Thank you , Major . We 'll move acrossin a minute . " He turned to Lee , paused , saw Lee 's eyes closed , said quietly , " General Lee ? With your permission , sir , I will take my staff across the river . I expect General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wants to get across this river as much as we do . " Lee looked at him now , and Longstreet suddenly felt foolish , knew it was the wrong thing to say . Lee looked into the shadow of Longstreet 's face . He felt a small tug of anger , but he would not say anything of it , would not lay blame on anyone . " General Longstreet , you may accompany your corps . " Longstreet bowed slightly , saluted , pulled the horse away . Lee watched him , the staff gathering together , the horses moving in slippery steps down to the bridge head . Longstreet was right , there were many mistakes . But he would not think on that now , would not see the faces , the commanders who had not done the job , would not think on troop movements and poor cooperation , could not even recall his own orders , the horrors of what he had seen , what they had all seen in those three days . He had tried to understand it , to sort it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew the memories would come back in time , and the images would be as sharp and painful as so many of the memories he carried from the fights long before . Even the great victories held vast horror , but he could not even recall those , the days when you knew you had beaten those people , had driven them from the field , commanders like Pope and Hooker , who by their bluster and profane arrogance invited nothing less than total defeat . And the incompetence of Burnside , who threw his very good army against an impossibly strong position , and so sent his own men to a senseless slaughter . Lee tried to recall the feeling , standing on his hill behind Fredericksburg , hearing the bright yells and joyous shouts from below , his men looking out at the bloody fields in front of them , understanding how utterly complete their victory had been . He tried to remember the chaos at Chancellorsville , the complete destruction of the Federal flank , how Jackson had nearly crushed the Federal army in a panic so complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ended the war right there . But Jackson would not be stopped by nightfall , kept moving forward , even when his men could not , and in a dark and terrifying night his own men had panicked at the sound of horses , had fired at silhouettes in the moonlight . Lee saw the face again . He had not been to see Jackson after he was wounded , but the reports from the doctors , from the staff , were optimistic , just an arm , he would recover . Then suddenly the bright blue light was gone , and not from the wounds , but from pneumo-nia . And it was only ... He tried to think . Two months ago . Or an eternity . Already now there were letters , reports beginning to move through the army , commanders deflecting the blame they knew was yet to come . There would be the newspapers , of course , and the letters from home , questioning . Some of the officers had already made protests , angry challenges , hot criticisms of the generals Lee trusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those men had not performed , and in the maze of faces and names and mistakes , he knew that ultimately no one could be held responsible but him . Now there was fresh motion on the road , reflections from a new line of troops . It was the Third Corps , A. P. Hill 's men . They moved out of the woods , marched down toward the angry water , and again Lee watched , sat quietly on Traveller as his army moved silently through the wet misery of the retreat , knowing once again the war would roll on in a bloody wash of men and machines back into Virginia . August 1863 He halted the army south of the Rapidan River , near Orange Court House , and as they slowly gathered together , many of the stragglers and men with light wounds began to return . In the weeks since the start of the retreat , it was the first time Lee could see his army for what it had now become , how badly the impact of Gettysburg had changed the strength , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were bare now . No farmers workedthe land , the homes and barns were empty , most of the big trees were gone . The war had long since claimed this part of Virginia , and Lee hardly recognized this countryside . He stood at the edge of a wide field of dried mud , knew that this land , this fertile and beautiful ground , had once borne the bounty , the tall corn , the vast green oceans of grain . Now it was gray and barren , wagon tracks cutting through in all directions , the former campsites of both armies , and for now it was his again . The men were spread out around him , secure in the new camp , and Lee rode along the hard road , away from his own tents , where the staff worked with the papers , sorting out the problems in the regiments , the brigades , the endless fight for supplies . Taylor had encouraged him to slip away , and Lee was grateful , knew this young man with the boundless energy could handle the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rode slowly away , did not look back , did not see Taylor watching him , peering past the lengthening line of soldiers , officers , men with complaints or " urgent " business . He moved down the hard road , past the troops who now stopped to watch him . There were shouts , calls of greeting , and even now , even with the hard wounds of the great defeat , the men still rose up and gathered , still called his name . He reined the horse , lifted his hat , a small salute , looked at the faces and then beyond , saw the numbers , the wide field spread with the men who were still there , still with him . They did not look to him for comfort or pity , and he did not see pain or defeat . They still made the cheerful calls , faces bright with the look that says , We are still your army , and we will fight again . There had been desertions , many stragglers who were captured or simply disappeared . The muddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost the strength , the energy , for the fight . The casualties were staggering , over twenty thousand men , nearly a quarter of his army gone . But as much as he mourned the loss of the fighting men , it was their commanders , the brigade and regimental officers , who would have to replaced . As the war flowed into its third year , the men who knew how to lead , the capable commanders with an instinct for battle , were becoming more and more scarce . He thought of the names , saw the faces : Lew Armistead , Jim Barksdale , Pender , Garnett , Pettigrew . They were gone , and there were none better . He thought of young John Bell Hood , the huge blond-haired man from Texas whom he had known so well in the old cavalry , the man who loved chasing Comanches all through the misery of the frontier . Lee had always thought Hood was indestructible , but he was down too , a severe wound , might still lose an arm . And old Isaac Trimble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's failure to take Cemetery Hill , a catastrophic mistake in a fight with many mistakes . Trimble was a fierce and disagreeable man whom Lee knew he could trust absolutely , but Trimble had been wounded as well , had to be left behind , and so was captured . You could not train new leaders , you could not replace what a man had brought with him from the battlefields in Mexico . There was no fresh class from West Point or VMI . The new officers were young , very young , and if a man did not have the gut instinct , could not take his men forward with absolute command of himself and his situation , there was no time to teach him , to show him his mistakes . Now , when mistakes were made , the men did not come back . He spurred the horse again , moved beyond the camp , saw the road turning through a small grove of thick trees . It was hot , growing hotter , and he looked to the shade , moved that way . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snaking its way in the dark coolness , flowing close to the road . He reined the horse , watched the thin stream of water rolling over polished rocks , was suddenly very thirsty . He climbed down , and Traveller moved to the water with him . Lee bent low , cupped his hand and took a deep cold drink . He stood , wiped at his face with a wet hand , watched the horse now nosing the edge of the stream . He could still hear the men , the sounds of the camp carrying beyond the fields , and there was even music , a banjo , and he smiled at that , felt a sudden pride . Yes , he thought , they are not beaten . I should take a lesson from that . He reached into his pocket , felt for the letter , pulled it out . It was the reply , the inevitable response from Jefferson Davis . Lee understood that in this army , in any army , it was the commander who must bear the responsibility . If he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ponderous prose from the fat men in their clean offices in Richmond , Charleston , Atlanta , the men who had built up the expectations of their nation with the move northward . They gave their readers the first reports of the glorious invasion of the North , reported outrageous rumors as fact , the defeat of Meade 's army , the imminent capture of Washington . Lee had not seen the papers until after the battle , then read the absurd reports with deep dread , because he knew that when the truth came out , when the reports of the fighting became real , the impact would be far worse . So with the first major accounts from Pennsylvania , the papers that had given the people grand headlines of their mythic victory , the victory that would surely end the war , now gave them the story of crushing defeat . The papers had provided the power behind the myth , and many had come to believe that his army was invincible . Now they had to accept that it was not always so , and many would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not temper what many were saying . Lee had lost the fight . As he absorbed the anger , the reckless calls from the papers , the voices of those quick to place blame , to seek the simple explanation , he . The letter had been as much a response to the papers as to the president personally , an effort to relieve any criticism of the army , the men who had done the fighting . And if Lee accepted responsibility for the failure , he also began to accept that his health was becoming an issue , and for the first time he had wondered if his heart problems might have clouded his judgment . So , at least he had provided Davis with an excuse , a reason for accepting his resignation , which would preserve his honor . Now , as Lee stood beside the big horse in the cool shade , he held Davis 's reply in his hand . He opened the letter , read it again . If Davis had become fragile , even suspicious and secretive in his dealings with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that many never saw , that Lee had often forgotten . He scanned the page , paused at the words " my dear friend , " smiled , then read silently . To ask me to substitute you by one in my judgment more fit to command , or who could possess more of the confidences of the army , or of the reflecting men of the country , is to demand an impossibility . He looked back toward the sounds from the field , thought , The confidences of the army . He knew Davis was right , he had just seen it again in the faces of the men . He put his hand out , touched Traveller 's neck , said aloud , " Well , if they want me to lead them still , then I will lead them . After all , my friend , what else can I do ? " He climbed up , considered moving farther away , exploring the road deeper into the shade of the trees , but before he could tug at the reins , the big gray horse turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men .
