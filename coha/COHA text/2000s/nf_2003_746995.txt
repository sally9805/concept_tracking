UNMANNED AIRCRAFT ARE MAKING HEWS TODAY , BUT THEIR BEGINNINGS DATE BACK TO THE GREAT WAR . <p> In a test that took place several years ago , a small , pilotless biplane took off from Cook Field in Dayton , Ohio . A team led by the inventor Charles Kettering had developed the airborne contraption , conceived as a top-secret weapon to deliver explosives against enemy troops . <p> That was 1918 , toward the end of World War I. The craft was the first practical unmanned airplane . <p> Its descendants today seem like wonders from the cutting edge of technology . And , in many ways , they are . Their promise for military and peaceful uses seems only to grow . But the Predator and other drones , which have become an integral weapon of air supremacy over Iraq and Afghanistan , have their roots in the very earliest days of conflict in the air . <p> The first unmanned aerial vehicle took the name of its chief engineer . The Kettering Bug measured just 6 feet across and 5 feet long , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Motor Co. , and had enough lift to carry a 250-pound warhead . It was , according to Dik Daso , curator for modern military aircraft at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington , D.C. , the first practical example of an unmanned aerial vehicle in the form of an airplane . <p> The plan was to launch the Bug from a track , from which it would fly along a straight path toward enemy lines . A counter would keep track of the number of revolutions made by the propeller , and at the desired time , fuel would be cut off from the engine and the Bug would plunge to earth and explode . The Bug had no direct control . An altitude sensor and pneumatic controls based on bellows from a player piano controlled its climb . <p> The airplane had a tendency to circle in the sky , Daso said . In early tests , the Bug orbited the fields , buzzed the brass in observation stands , and crashed . Eventually , a gyroscope was used to get it to fly fairly straight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 of the planes . Toward the end of 1918 , aviator Henry " Hap " Arnold , who would later command the U.S. Army Air Forces in World War II , was dispatched to Europe to convince General Pershing to use the Bug against Germany . The two never got to speak and , in any case , the war ended before the Bug could be deployed in combat . <p> Yet the Kettering Bug got people thinking , and interest in using unmanned aerial vehicles in combat continued throughout the 20th century . One idea , under the Aphrodite Project during World War II , was to enlist torn-up B-17 and B-24 bombers that were no longer suitable for combat missions . <p> A two-man crew took up the " weary " bomber , packed with explosives , and armed it in the air . The crew then bailed out over British territory and the bomber , equipped with radio control technology developed in the 1920s and 1930s , was steered from another plane that followed , to maneuver it over enemy lines . <p> The Allies launched 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very successful , and they were easy to shoot down , Daso said . The project was scrapped when Joseph Kennedy , the older brother of future President John F. Kennedy , and his fellow crewman were killed when the weary bomber they were flying blew up over England . Proponents such as Arnold viewed unmanned aerial vehicles as a way of avoiding the losses sustained by crewed aircraft flying over heavily defended targets , Daso said . <p> Part of the lineage of unmanned aerial vehicles is their use as targets . Starting in 1939 , a company called Radioplane manufactured its first unmanned aircraft that would be used by the U.S. Army Air Corps to train gunners . " They would fly these big model airplanes - at the time , very high-tech controlled models - and shoot them down , " said Doug Fronius , the target programs director for Northrop Grumman Corp . in San Diego . Northrop Grumman acquired Radioplane in 1962 , giving it entre to the unmanned aircraft business . TARGET PRACTICE <p> In 1999 , Northrop Grumman boosted its presence in target aircraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Spirit of St. Louis for Charles Lindbergh in 1927 . In 1948 , Ryan was one of 14 companies to respond to a U.S. Air Force proposal for a jet-powered target aircraft . Ryan won the award and produced the first jet-powered target , the Q2C , which made its first flight in 1952 . The Q2C evolved into the BQM34 Firebee , which is in service today . <p> The real value of air power in World War I was its role in observation and artillery spotting , according to Daso . Unmanned aerial vehicles were ideally suited for this purpose : Cameras were light , and would get lighter . <p> In October of 1962 , the downing of a U2 spy plane prompted a project to put a camera on the Firebee , Fronius said . The program was scrapped when the Cuban Missile Crisis ended shortly thereafter , but the seed was planted to use unmanned aerial vehicles for reconnaissance . <p> When the United States became involved in the conflict in Southeast Asia , unmanned aerial vehicles were outfitted with film cameras , and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Real-time delivery of information was not common at the time . Although transmitting capabilities existed , more often cameras were retrieved and the film developed later on . <p> Fronius said the era saw the development of specially designed unmanned aerial vehicles , not merely converted target craft . Some were quite sophisticated , capable of flying at high altitudes and for long periods of time . He added that the industry still did not implement computational power , digital payload development that allowed the use of stealth cameras , or the Global Positioning System . Those developments were key to distinguishing later unmanned aerial vehicles from earlier versions . <p> During the 1980s , the desire to keep pilots out to harm 's way and advances in technology came together to focus new attention on unmanned aircraft , Fronius said . In late 2002 , the U.S. Department of Defense issued a " roadmap " for the development of unmanned aerial vehicles over the next 25 years and outlined plans to develop unmanned aerial vehicles by every branch of the service . <p> Overall , the DOD invested about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and another billion dollars since 2000 . It plans to invest another $10 billion over the next decade . Today , the number of unmanned aerial vehicles in the field stands at 90 ; that number could quadruple by 2012 . U.S. aerospace companies have unmanned aerial vehicles under development ro handle a wide range of missions , those commonly characterized as " the dull , the dirty , and the dangerous " that is , long duration flights , sampling of hazardous materials , and exposure to hostile action . CIVILIAH FLIGHT <p> Unmanned aerial vehicles may also serve civilian uses . NASA recently concluded a program known as Environmental Research Aircraft and Sensor Technology . The goal of the program , which was started in 1994 , was to develop unmanned aerial vehicles and instruments that could be used in science missions too risky for NASA 's current science research aircraft . <p> One of the final steps of the program was to run " detect , sec , and avoid " demonstrations to test the feasibility of flying unmanned aerial vehicles in the proximity of other aircraft , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Access Five , will lay the regulatory groundwork that would allow a business case to be made for bringing unmanned aerial vehicles into the commercial market . Besides NASA , the program will also include the Department of Defense , Federal Aviation Administration , and six airframe manufacturers . It will also address technical issues , such as the ability to sense and avoid other aircraft , and secure command and control links , according to Jeffrey Bauer , who will be heading up the program . <p> Any decision to integrate unmanned aerial vehicles into national airspace will lie with the FAA . <p> Bauer sees the civilian applications of unmanned aerial vehicles as compelling . One obvious application for unmanned aircraft is in homeland defense , and he said there have been discussions with the U.S. Coast Guard along those lines . <p> He said that other government agencies , involved with forestry , land resources , and disaster management , have expressed interest in unmanned aerial vehicles . While it is too early to predict exactly where these initial efforts will lead , the groundwork is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The Bug took off from a track . At a predetermined time , the wings released , causing the plane to plunge to the earth , where it detonated . <p> Unmanned aerial vehicles such as this circa 1946 target drone were built by the Radioplane Co. to train antiaircraft gunners during World War II . <p> Weary bombers , such as the radio-controlled B-17G Flying Fortress , were used with small success as flying bombs during the World War II . <p> World War II era target drones preceded unmanned aerial vehicles for surveillance in the coming decades . <p> On Feb. 23 , 2003 , the Northrop Grumman futuristic unmanned Pegasus X-47A completed a 12-minute test flight at China Lake , Calif . <p> By John Degaspari <p>
