THIS LAND Headnote Lava , glaciers , wind , and water have left a legacy of eye-catching mountains . Photograph The view northwest from the Devils Causeway // In northwestern Colorado , within the great Rocky Mountain range , is a mass of blunt-topped mountains known as the Flat Tops . Rising roughly 9,000 to 12,000 feet above sea level , they have been carved out at the eastern edge of a large plateau by the action of wind , water , and Ice Age glaciers . The patterns of erosion are striking , in part because underlying layers of sedimentary rocks ( sandstone , limestone , shale ) are capped by a harder layer of basalt , a volcanic rock . Some of the mountains have amphitheater-like shapes that almost appear to be the work of giants . Flowing westward across the plateau from the Flat Tops is the White River , a tributary of the Colorado . It passes through rolling grasslands and , in less and areas ( generally on north- or east-facing slopes and along streams ) , through stands of forest . Above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the habitat is alpine tundra . From there down to about 8,100 feet is a subalpine forest with subalpine fir , mountain ash , and other species . Below this level grows montane forest , where the subalpine fir and mountain ash are virtually absent . A spruce bark beetle epidemic in the middle of the twentieth century left behind many standing dead trees in the Flat Tops area , so it is often referred to as the Ghost Forest . The Flat Tops fall within the Routt and the White River National Forests , where a nearly 370-square-mile section has been designated the Flat Tops Wilderness Area . This rugged zone is off-limits to motorized vehicles and equipment , but a scenic , mostly gravel highway meanders across the plateau for eighty-two miles , connecting Yampa and Phippsburg in the east to Meeker in the west . Taken westward , the highway first climbs to Dunckley Pass and , after following a roller-coaster course , tops out at 10,343 feet at Ripple Creek Pass . It then descends toward the North Fork of the White River . The main road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for about eight miles to Trappers Lake , near which are a campground and the Trappers Lake Lodge and Resort . Trappers Lake , which lies within the wilderness area , was the first US . National Forest property to be treated as a wilderness-long before Congress passed the Wilderness Act of 1964 . In 1919 the US . Forest Service hired a young landscape architect , Arthur H. Carhart , and told him to do a survey for a road around the lake and several homesites on the lakeshore . Carhart completed the task but urged his supervisor , Carl Stahl , to save the lake for wilderness recreation . Stahl backed the recommendation , and in 1920 Trappers Lake was declared an area to be kept free of roads and development . Carhart 's vision remains a landmark in the history of wilderness preservation : " There is a limit to the number of lands of shoreline on the lakes ; there is a limit to the number of lakes in existence ; there is a limit to the mountainous areas of the world , " he wrote in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty which are God-made , and ... which of a right should be the property of all people . " Trappers Lake is nearly a mile and a half long and a little more than half a mile across at its widest point . Providing a formidable background on its northeast side is the socalled Chinese Wall , a sheer face that rises 1,650 feet . This basalt formation extends for nearly five miles in an irregular semicircle . Because of its sheerness and direct exposure to the afternoon sun , the side facing the lake is bare of vegetation except for some rock  --  hugging lichens . The view of the Chinese Wall from below is rewarding enough , but adventuresome hikers can take various trails that provide a close-up experience . ( Horses may also be hired at the lodge . ) My wife , Beverly , and I took the Stillwater Trail , which heads east from Trappers Lake , passes Little Trappers Lake , and , after a sharp bend , comes face-to-face with the wall . At this point the trail climbs over the formation 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in little more than a mile . After another mile , we turned onto the Chinese Wall Trail , which winds northward near the top of the mountain . Two miles along this route , we came to a branch trail leading east to the Devils Causeway . This , we soon discovered , is a craggy ridge only four feet wide , with precipitous 1,500-foot drop-offs on both sides . The passage looked far too scary , so we retraced our steps and continued north . After a gentle descent , we reached the Lost Lakes Trail and headed back south to complete our round trip .

Slender wheatgrass , nodding brome , fringed brome , oat grass , red fescue , June grass , and mountain muhly are the most abundant species in dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuing on into autumn . Where a more moist habitat is created by seeps , the grasses include redtop and meadow foxtail . Above 10,000 feet , Thurber 's fescue and alpine timothy are common . Roads that penetrate the Flat Tops have disturbed the native vegetation , permitting the invasion of European species such as orchard grass and timothy , along with opportunistic wildflowers such as milfoil ( yarrow ) , oxeye daisy , fleabane , Indian paintbrush , and thistles . Sidebar ALpine tundra vegetation consists of dwarf willow trees about one foot tall , an abundance of sedges , and various deep-rooted , mat-forming wildflowers . Among these are nailwort , slender mountain sandwort , rock jasmine , and alpine primrose . Sidebar Subalpine forest has subalpine fir , Engelmann spruce , lodgepole pine , and mountain ash . Myrtle-leaved blueberry is the most abundant shrub , while a species of wild rose ( Rosa Sidebar woodsii ) and Colorado currant are also common . Wildflowers include larkspurs , Colorado blue columbine ( the state flower ) , several species of beard-tongue ( Penstemon ) , sweet cicely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resemble those of daisies , except that they are entirely yellow or orange . Sidebar Montane forest has lodgepole pine and Engelmann spruce , with Douglas fir often found on north slopes and ponderosa pine on south slopes . Other trees include aspen and Rocky Mountain maple . The mixture of shrubs and wildflowers is similar to that in the subalpine zone , but wax currant grows here instead of Colorado currant . Sidebar WetLand habitat appears along the streams and around the ponds and lakes that dot the plateau . These areas are often lined with Geyer 's willow , Wolf 's willow , and narrowleaf cottonwood . Red elderberry , snowberry , and a species of prickly currant are common in the shrub zone . Among the wildflowers are a wild geranium , an aster ( Aster porteri ) with smooth stems and leaves , leafy arnica , yellow monkey flower , meadow rue , and bluebells . The scouring rush , a spore-bearing plant with jointed , leafless stems , is also common .
