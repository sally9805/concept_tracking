<p> Jim Berieau , a bartender , recently did something that seemed foolish . In the middle of last year 's napping economy , he decided to buy a restaurant , the Humble Pie , in Raleigh 's bohemian West End . He calculated that a new train depot - with boutiques , artists ' studios , and townhouses nearby - would draw enough patrons to sustain his Spanish-style eatery . <p> While the final result of his experiment in chorizo capitalism is n't known , Mr. Berieau for now is overlord of a thriving business - for which he has hired a dozen people . " It seems like people who have come into town have gotten rooted here , " he says . " It 's kind of an up-and-coming urban area , but it 's not outrageously expensive like most cities . " <p> Berieau 's journey into entrepreneurship is one reason Raleigh 's unemployment rate recently dropped to 3.6 percent - among the lowest in the nation . It also helps explain a paradoxical job recovery in the South : Despite the thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnolia-scented region is now leading the nation in job creation . <p> From the Virginia Sounds to the mirror-skinned towers of Houston , large segments of the South are posting some of the highest employment gains in the country , which is particularly significant given the magnitude of the textile and other shop-floor losses of the past decade . Though pockets of hardship endure - and the region continues to lag in wealth creation - the economic growth has been impressive . <p> " When we talk about jobs being created in the South , we 're talking about everything from medical technicians to software writers to barbers , " says Bernard Weinstein , director of the Center for Economic Development and Research in Denton , Texas . " We 're not seeing an outmigration , even though a lot of basic industries were hit hard , and that 's telling me there 's a lot of fermentation going on underneath the surface . " <p> The numbers bespeak some of the vibrancy : <p> * Total nonfarm employment in the South grew slightly over the past four years , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 million jobs . <p> * From November 2003 to April 2004 , the region 's jobless rate dropped from 5.6 to 5.0 - the lowest rate of any US region . <p> * More locally , Virginia has posted a net gain of nearly 34,000 jobs the past four years , despite losing some 60,000 manufacturing . Florida has added nearly 278,000 positions . North Carolina produced more jobs , too , even though it lost 155,000 manufacturing positions . <p> " In the South , you 've truly got areas that are magnets now , that have the jobs , " says Mike Wald , a regional economist for the US Bureau of Labor Statistics in Atlanta . " They 've done a beautiful turnaround , for example , in D.C. and northern Virginia and Maryland , and nobody even told Florida there was a recession going on . " <p> Why the South is rising <p> Behind the South 's vigor lies a variety of forces , from low wage rates and " right to work " laws to a languid lifestyle . Certainly the region 's enduring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are moving to the South - which now contains one third of the US population - than any other region . Retiring baby boomers have helped boost population growth across the Sun Belt by as much as 50 percent more than some other areas . The demographic surge is reflected in robust housing numbers : In March , 613,000 new homes were sold in the South - nearly as much as all other US regions combined . <p> One notable characteristic of the new migrants is that they are staying put . In the recession of the late 1980s and early 1990s , many laid-off Southerners moved elsewhere looking for work . In the more recent downturn , many hung around - and are now finding jobs in an emerging service economy . <p> For instance , when Ben McLawhorn and his friends - many of them originally from the North - lost their jobs at a big pharmaceutical company near Raleigh a few years ago , the question quickly became : What now ? <p> A North Carolina native , Mr. McLawhorn found a job with the state as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home to Schenectady , N.Y. , and Detroit , dealt with the layoffs by opening their own firms in Raleigh . Today those businesses are worth millions and employ hundreds in and around this capital city . " In the end , it took a major job loss for them to follow their dreams , " says McLawhorn . <p> Quality of life is one reason many workers have decided to stay and others are moving in . The region 's coastal areas , misty inland mountains , year-round golf courses , and temperate climate all are part of a new equation may employers look at when siting plants and businesses . <p> " As more and more of our production and employment is geared toward services , the location , for employees , is much more of a consideration , " says David Penn , an economist with Middle Tennessee State University at Murfreesboro . Moreover , the easier rhythms appeal to many people , too . " People come South and stay for the climate , quality of life and work , and the slower pace , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City put things in perspective : Life is too short to be chasing the fast buck or the fast lifestyle . " <p> In a coffee shop in Portsmouth , N.H. , for instance , George Coulston , a local carpenter , recently noted how he was going to move to Richmond , Va. , to renovate antebellum homes . Another area resident , a cemetery manager , was already packing to move to Charleston , S.C. , the " rose of the Confederacy . " " I 'm sick of the weather and the pace in the North , " he said . <p> In some cases , states are making strategic investments that are contributing to the South 's revival . North Carolina , for instance , is funding a first-of-its-kind broadband network across the state that is intended to attract Web-based firms and software startups . The Raleigh area alone is expected to add a net 20,000 jobs by the end of 2004 . <p> In Georgia , the decision to build a new terminal at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport sparked a miniboom in construction that helped yield a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Tupelo , Miss. , investments in local industry helped turn the Tupelo Furniture Market into the second-largest in the country , bringing in new firms such as Bauhaus and Tecumseh . <p> In Greenwood , S. C. , the state spent almost $ 1 million to send potential workers for Fuji Film to Japan for training . The gambit paid off : While Kodak has downsized in New York , Fuji is growing in South Carolina . <p> With the new vibrancy is coming a new entrepreneurialism . Dave Jones , a former professional hockey player , recently defied the naysayers and started Marketing Ministries - a PR firm in Raleigh with an evangelical twist . He now has three employees and double-digit growth . " I call it God 's economy , " he says . Rick Porter has captured the spirit , too . " Around here , if you want a job , you can make one , " says Mr. Porter , who owns a two-employee car detailing shop in Raleigh . <p> Not all is a yellow brick road <p> Still , economic disparities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country . In fact , the overall poorest states are firmly Southern ones , including Alabama , Mississippi , and South Carolina . And experts point out that the job boomlet has largely bypassed Tobacco Road and the South 's defining rural areas - the ones hardest hit by the manufacturing trend toward outsourced labor . <p> Only 70 miles east of Raleigh , textile-dominated Rocky Mount is facing 9 percent unemployment after a rash of factory closings . The accelerated job-gains in the cities , moreover , means the gap between richer metro-dwellers and their poorer country cousins is only increasing throughout the South . " It might have been a stretch for North Carolina Sen. John Edwards in his presidential run to speak about two Americas , but there are clearly two North Carolinas , " says Michael Walden , an agriculture economist at North Carolina State University in Raleigh . <p> Yet for many professionals , the South is a harbinger of what some say is the " new " economic expansion : smaller , riskier , and , to an extent , freer . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to move back North , " says McLawhorn . " And I just keep asking him : " Why would you ever want to do that ? " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 . The Christian Science Monitor
