As a child , I was made to look out the window of a moving car and appreciate the beautiful scenery , with the result that now I do n't care much for nature . I prefer parks , ones with radios going chuckawaka chuckawaka and the delicious whiff of bratwurst and cigarette smoke . <P> Rocky coastlines are not that interesting . Nor are beaches : you just wind up staring at the ocean . Forests are nothing but trees . Deserts are beautiful for about 15 min. , but they 're always out in the middle of nowhere . As for mountains , an occasional range is nice , but mountains tend to cluster and become a continuous piece of bad art , a painting you 'd see at an estate sale and not buy . And mountain people are a pain . Vermonters , for example , tend to be very sniffy about who is worthy to set foot in their midst and use their toilet facilities . In Minnesota we are astonished and gratified if anyone visits us , and we ca n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , and we are extremely nice people . <P> My favorite scenic attraction is the canyon , or reverse mountain , especially when it occurs on a flat surface , such as the Grand Canyon . You get the best of both worlds here : levelness , or platitude , and de-elevation . And the magnificence of the erosionary process . And when you go visit , you do n't run into flinty-eyed people busily despising you for your yellow plaid walking shorts and a T shirt that says SAVE THE WHALES . TRADE THEM FOR VALUABLE PRIZES . The canyon belongs to the world . ( I believe there is a separate entrance for Sierra Club members , the Ansel Adams Trail , where they do n't need to encounter us and the landscape is black and white . ) <P> You put on your whale T shirt and shorts and walking shoes with wool socks and a pack with a bottle of water and a bag of trail mix and head down the Bright Angel Trail from the South Rim . This is a splendid experience . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ videotaping the canyon , panning from left to right and then right to left , and you plunge down the trail , which is broad and not too steep and studded with mule manure , and a hundred or so feet down , once you come around the second switchback , all the hubbub of the rim vanishes , and you enter into a magnificent silence . <P> The trail switches back and forth , and though there may be hundreds of hikers on it , you are often alone , and you can peer over the edge at 2,000 or 3,000 ft. of rock face . And then , when you weary of geology , some folks come trudging along , and you get to switch to anthropology . <P> The proportion of young French , German and Scandinavian hikers is high on the trail , most Americans preferring the video version , so it 's a foreign-exchange experience . You meet sinewy , tanned , multilingual Europeans striding purposefully upward , talking , one assumes , about man 's fate and the future of culture and such things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American sitting on a rock and gasping for breath , sweating off the Big Macs , thinking about coronary occlusion . There are moral fables everywhere you look . Despicable , whiny teenagers slouch along , and valiant geezers pass them . It 's Pilgrim 's Progress in real life .
