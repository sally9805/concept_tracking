When the last seconds tick off the clock Tuesday night and " The Shield " airs its final episode ever , you can climb slowly into the shower and take a long hot one . <p> It 's been a brutal , dirty ride as the FX series documented the ethically perverse nature of one Vic Mackey Michael Chiklis , leader of the anti-gang Strike Team of the Los Angeles Police Department . Set in the fictional Farmington district but shot on location in an all-too-real Los Angeles - nongloss , glitterless - " The Shield " was mostly about corrupt cops on the mean streets , but that never did justice to what the series was able to do in portraying emotional nuance , situational ethics and how the slightest fleck of dirt can turn into a mudslide over time . <p> No doubt viewers will need a cathartic shower . <p> For seven seasons , " The Shield " was a grand achievement . And in Tuesday 's finale , the series goes out strong . There was no other way , really . It came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-hero sentiments branding FX and changing basic cable along the way - and the series never stopped kicking . No real fan ever thought " The Shield " would limp to the finish line . It had to bleed out . There was no other option . <p> So , yes , Tuesday 's finale is a harrowing last episode . But in this season , have n't they all been ? Led by Chiklis in a muscular role that he never let flag - a career-defining achievement - " The Shield " told taut stories of drugs and gangs on the L.A. streets . <p> Mackey and his Strike Team of Shane Vendrell Walter Goggins , Curtis " Lem " Lemansky Kenny Johnson and Ronnie Gardocki David Rees Snell were bad cops when we met them and they stayed that way throughout . What made them interesting , even likable as anti-heroes must be to sustain viewer interest , is that " The Shield " went beyond watching them knock heads with drug dealers in the hardest of L.A. streets - rationalizing brutality for end-result crime solving - and gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important , a winding , complex story line where the rope of opportunity turns into a noose over time . <p> " The Shield " set the hook early . Mackey killed a fellow cop in the very first episode of Season 1 - an out-of-nowhere stunner - and the audience was staggered , left to wonder whom to root for . <p> Most of Season 1 dealt with morals and allegiances and variations on survival in the streets for cops and criminals . It also put Mackey front and center , the face of reckless amorality - his tough talk and swagger evoking Western gunslingers - and left it up to viewers to decide what to make of him . It was bold storytelling , and Chiklis gave a virtuoso performance and has n't stopped , solidifying the character 's believability and doling out bits of humanity Mackey has three children and two of them are autistic - his love of family clashing wildly with his badge-carrying transgressions . <p> But " The Shield " really took off in Season 2 . Where Season 1 established shock and conflicted viewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward . The series had to grow . And it did this by setting up a theme : One bad deed leads to another . And that rationalization breeds contempt , and contempt blurs all the nobility of the profession , obfuscating the very reason why a cop would become a cop in the first place . It 's the lie of the mind that creator Shawn Ryan so expertly planted that gave heft and emotional resonance to " The Shield " in subsequent seasons . <p> Because when Mackey and the Strike Team dodged a sure bullet , or got more dirt on them but came out unscathed at the end of the day , all it did was embolden and enable them . Like a rock rolling downhill , " The Shield " gained its dramatic gravitas by the audience understanding that it was all going to end badly and probably violently for these cops . <p> And it has . <p> Shane killed Lem in Season 5 as all the lies and shadows of doubt grew bigger and longer . Glenn Close and Forest Whitaker had memorable turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying to bring Mackey and the Strike Team down ; their actions added heat to an already hot kitchen . <p> The progressive spiraling has reached epic tenseness this final season . It 's been riveting television week to week , watching it all go to hell as Vic runs out of cards to play , and out of lives . <p> Last week , when it looked like he 'd have his escape - full immunity by helping the Feds - the unfettered burden of Mackey 's actions came out , at first slowly , and then with seeming relief , as he confessed everything . When the stunned Feds reel back , they ca n't believe there 's more to tell . Mackey looks at the recorder and says , " How much memory has that thing got ? " - it 's a fabulous moment and a classic line . <p> The question is : Will the main players get what they deserve ? And what does that mean , ultimately ?

If " The Shield " was only about bad cops , it would be one-dimensional . There were great detectives as well , ethically and morally clean and fueled , in part , by a desire to take down Mackey and clean up the squad . <p> CCH Pounder did Emmy-worthy work as Claudette Wyms ; she was Mackey 's ethical opposite . She was driven by justice and a determination to be as hard as any of her male peers , but cleaner , smarter and unstoppable even in the face of a debilitating illness . Jay Karnes was also wonderful as Dutch , the enigmatic and intuitive detective who brought some humanity to the department . <p> Equally important were the uniformed cops who did their jobs with dignity every day . And the detectives who pushed the paper and never cut corners in slow-moving investigations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normalcy " in the cesspool of Mackey 's dirty clubhouse , was a much-needed way to offset the overriding corruption and bad-cop transgressions . Ryan was wise to weave that into the show for balance . <p> But the allure , of course , was how the law was on the wrong side of the law and how that played with the viewers moral compass when bad guys brought down worse guys . At what price justice in the real world ? That 's what " The Shield " was about . <p> In Tuesday 's finale , titled " Family Meeting " the series was very much about families , from the street cops to the detectives , the Strike Team , Vic 's family , Shane 's family , the connections were all around , there 's a darkness descending that ca n't be overlooked .
