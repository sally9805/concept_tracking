<p> If you 've got the looks , the talent , and the Mandarin , forget Hollywood - the Chinese entertainment industry wants you . <p> And even if you 're a foreigner in China who does n't have any of those things , do n't worry . You 've got a decent chance of getting on television , anyway . <p> In cities nationwide , recruiters are prowling university campuses and expatriate hangouts in search of aspiring variety show performers , game show contestants , and film extras . <p> Pretty much any kind of foreigner will do , with one exception : " They definitely prefer people that do n't look Asian , " says American expatriate Ben Ross . <p> Westerners are cropping up on all kinds of television shows - literally plucked from the street . Some foreign entertainers see their moment in the sun as an opportunity to help Chinese people better understand the West . But their Chinese audience is just as interested in how the outside world views the rapid economic advances of their homeland . <p> " We like watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Beijing retiree Wu Yuqing . " They show us that the world is getting smaller . " <p> And China 's television and movie producers are eager to cater to this desire . " Chinese people really want to know what foreigners here are thinking , " says Beijing casting agent Li Erwei . " They want to know what foreigners think of China and how they view our culture . " <p> And sometimes , the appeal of a foreigner on television in a homogenous society is more basic . <p> " On my first show , the idea was basically to get laughs out of foreigners doing silly things , " says Mr. Ross , a blogger and former English teacher who has appeared on Chinese television with a spiky wig and fake guitar while singing well-known Chinese pop songs . <p> Amateur actors also learn that an amusing accent here is sometimes better than absolute fluency . " They told me : start speaking Chinese , but then start messing up and ask if you can speak in English , " says Ross . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Television producers offer between 400 and 1,000 RMB ( $50 to $125 ) per episode , but money is not the only motivation for some Western actors . " A lot of these shows I would have done for free , just to have fun , " says Wily Boyle , a Canadian who appeared on some of the same shows as Ross . <p> For a select group of foreign professionals , however , Chinese television is serious business . <p> The pioneer in this field was Canadian Mark Rowswell - better known as Da Shan , or Big Mountain - whose pitch-perfect Mandarin and comedic skill catapulted him to national celebrity in the late 1980s . <p> Since then , several successors have emerged on the talk show circuit . Frenchman Julien Gaudefroy , whose unaccented Chinese got him his first gig in an instructional language video , now hosts several talk shows across China . <p> Mr. Gaudefroy 's programs , which include " Foreigners ' Viewpoints " and " Foreigners Watching China , " feature guests opining on topics ranging from China 's one-child policy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard Doran , a professional radio host in China and an occasional guest on Gaudefroy 's programs , remains skeptical that such shows are actually improving mutual understanding . <p> " They still ask if we know how to use chopsticks , " he says . " Can you imagine a European television station putting a Pakistani immigrant family on television and asking if they 'd learned to use a knife and fork yet ? " <p> Regardless of the content , a host 's foreignness can be enough of a draw in itself . <p> " Foreign hosts who speak Chinese have a special appeal for Chinese audiences , " says Liu Yongli , a director for state-owned China Central Television . " When Chinese people see a foreigner who speaks good Chinese and has gotten to know Chinese culture well , we get a very warm feeling , seeing that someone respects China so much . " <p> The film world is somewhat less welcoming . Westerners interested primarily in acting work face all sorts of special challenges , not least of which is the expectation of fluent Mandarin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply do n't have that many parts available to them . And the roles they do get often reflect hackneyed stereotypes . <p> " People in general have some strange ideas about America , " says Jonathan Kos-Read , one of the few full-time Western actors in China . " For instance , Americans do n't love their parents and vice versa . Or , if you walk out of your front door in the US , 9 times out of 10 you 'll see a huge gun battle . That kind of thing . " <p> Mr. Kos-Read , who trained at the New York University film school , often plays " a rich American businessman who comes to China and falls in love with a Chinese girl . She 's torn for 10 episodes or so , but in the end , she always makes the right choice and sticks with her Chinese boyfriend . " <p> Film director Gu Rong agrees that foreign actors tend to get pigeonholed . " They 're often the antagonist , the central point of conflict , " he says . <p> American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before coming to China , sees it as her responsibility to give Chinese audiences a more balanced view of foreigners . " I 'm trying to make the depiction of foreigners more real , more dynamic , more three-dimensional . ... If there 's something wrong , I let the director know , " she says . " I would say 70 percent of the time they listen . " <p> Ms. Brogan , Kos-Read , and other Western actors in China often find themselves in the role of cultural ambassador , helping directors , screenwriters , and audiences come to a fuller understanding of Westerners in general . Kos-Read says their efforts are paying off . " It 's getting better fast . The scripts are improving . " <p> Unfortunately for Western newcomers , the acting scene is becoming more competitive . The growing population of foreigners in China has professionalized the film industry , creating higher entry barriers for anyone without formal training . <p> And for those aspiring television celebrities planning to sign up for Mandarin classes , you 'd better hurry . <p> " Maybe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent Chinese ... they wo n't be that interesting anymore , " says Mr. Liu . " But for now , they 're very unusual . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2007 . The Christian Science Monitor
