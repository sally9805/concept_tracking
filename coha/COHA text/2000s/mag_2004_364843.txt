The Lessons of D-Day <P> " The veterans who fought the crucial battles of World War II are real heroes . We should thank them every day of our lives . " KATHY HUGHES Lansing , Ill . <P> Nancy gibbs ' article " The Greatest Day , " on the 60th anniversary of the Normandy invasion May 31 , was one of the most moving pieces I have ever read on the topic of war . As the daughter of a soldier who served in World War II at the Battle of the Bulge , the wife of a sailor who served on river patrols in Vietnam and the friend of a young man who died in Iraq last October , I thank Gibbs for her insights and for putting the lessons of those conflicts in perspective . MARION DENNEHY Wakefield , Mass . <P> Like many children of World War II veterans , I was raised with a sense of patriotism . My father saw action in that war as a medic , but we never discussed his combat experience . It was n't until I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally realized what he must have endured . His goodbye to me contained little commentary about what to expect , but his eyes spoke volumes . While the nature of our wars was different , the willingness to sacrifice for others was identical . Like him , I did n't want to talk about what had happened after I returned from Vietnam . Sadly , my father passed away in 1991 without our ever having discussed those wartime experiences . After reading TIME 's D-day stories , I feel as though my father and I have finally shared what we went through . GARY J. BOSCO Dublin , Ohio <P> The memories of my childhood in Europe are filled with the horrors of World War II  --  death , hunger , cold and fear . I can not look at it as the " Good War , " as some people call it . There is no such thing . War at any time is a total collapse of civilization and is ultimately a terribly dehumanizing event . ISABELLA MIRAM La Jolla , Calif . <P> I am a U.S. army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tet offensive . The firsthand accounts you published of the D-day veterans brought back an unsettling , queasy sense of fear and inevitability , emotions I had n't felt in decades . The Normandy invaders ' day in hell humbles me . TERRY SCHAUER Sherman Oaks , Calif . <P> To suggest that D-DAY turned the tide of World War II exaggerates the significance of the landing . A widely acknowledged turning point was the 1942-43 Battle of Stalingrad , which ended in a dramatic reversal for the German army . Unfortunately , the Soviet Union 's critical contribution to Germany 's defeat is often downplayed by the West . JURGEN SCHMIDHUBER Manno-Lugano , Switzerland
