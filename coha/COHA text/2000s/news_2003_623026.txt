<p> Soon after arresting 17-year-old John Tennison for a gang murder in San Francisco 's Sunnydale neighborhood , Police Chief Earl Prentice Sanders , then a homicide inspector on the case , got a potentially " dynamite " tip . <p> A frightened young woman told Sanders in an early 1990 meeting that he had arrested the wrong man . She named another man as the real killer . And , in fact , the man confessed within months . <p> But Tennison now claims in federal court that Sanders and his longtime partner , Napoleon Hendrix , failed to properly disclose that evidence and engaged in other misconduct that denied him a fair trial and wrongly sent him to prison for 25 years to life . <p> The allegations against Sanders and Hendrix stemming from the 1990 trial present more trouble for Sanders , whose department has been shaken by the unrelated in <p> five ranking officers for conspiring to obstruct justice during an inquiry into a Nov. 20 assault by three off-duty officers . <p> Tennison 's motion , pending before U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowingly based their case on the false testimony of two girls , failed to disclose a $2,500 payment to the girls from a " Secret Witness Program , " and withheld evidence that could have cleared Tennison , including the confession . <p> " John Tennison is actually innocent and did not receive a fair trial , " said court papers filed by his pro bono federal court lawyers , Elliot Peters and Ethan Balogh of San Francisco 's Keker &; Van Nest law firm . They declined comment for this story , citing the pending case . <p> EVIDENCE DISCOUNTED <p> Deputy State Attorney General Glenn Pruden , who is defending the conviction on appeal , said in court papers that the new evidence is unreliable and that Tennison had been properly convicted . <p> Pruden conceded that the prosecution should have turned over the confession sooner , but denied that the delay or other prosecutorial actions violated Tennison 's rights . <p> Neither Hendrix nor Sanders , who is on medical leave from the department , returned calls seeking comment . Assistant District Attorney George Butterworth , who prosecuted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sanders acknowledged that certain evidence should have been turned over to Tennison 's trial lawyer , and said he assumed it had been . He and Hendrix denied improperly withholding evidence . <p> " I 've done probably between 400 to 500 cases , and it is my own personal privilege  --  I mean my own personal principles  --  that defense gets everything , " Sanders said in a deposition . <p> " And every defense counsel on the bench knows , if they did n't get something , they could come directly to Inspector Sanders , and I would see that they got it . And that 's been my reputation for 25 years . " <p> Sanders and Hendrix were legendary homicide inspectors who in the late 1980s and early 1990s investigated notorious gang violence that killed at least 47 people and terrorized neighborhoods in southeast San Francisco . <p> In the mid-1990s , the duo won praise for solving dozens of long-ignored homicides and making hundreds of other arrests as leaders of the department 's CRUSH  --  Crime Response Unit to Stop Homicides . But the unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to follow procedures and conducted searches without warrants . At the time , Sanders denied knowledge of any illegal searches . <p> YOUTH BEATEN AND KILLED <p> The Tennison case began on Aug. 19 , 1989 , when several men chased 18-year-old Roderick " Cooley " Shannon by car and foot to the parking lot of the Super Fair market at Leland and Rutland streets . Shannon tried to escape by scaling a fence , but his attackers pulled him down , beat him and shot him twice . <p> Within weeks , Sanders and Hendrix determined that " J.J. " Tennison and Anton " Soda Pop " Goff , 18 , killed Shannon . Police suspected they were members of a Hunters Point gang . <p> Tennison was tried in San Francisco County Superior Court , where the only witnesses against him were two girls . <p> Masina Fauolo , who was 11 at the time of the crime , and Pauline Maluina , who was 14 , testified they had been parked at a lot off Visitacion Avenue called " Lover 's Lane " near some other cars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other cars full of young men chased it . <p> The girls said they followed the chase to the market 's parking lot , where they saw several men attack Shannon . They named Tennison and Goff as responsible for the shooting . The two men were convicted on Oct. 3 , 1990 , of first-degree murder and conspiracy . <p> While in jail , Tennison heard that Lovinsky Ricard had boasted of killing Shannon . Tennison told his lawyer , who requested a new trial . At a May 1991 hearing , the prosecution opposed the request . <p> But on the next to the last day of the hearing , Assistant District Attorney Butterworth revealed that police had obtained a videotaped confession from Ricard six months earlier . <p> Butterworth told the court he had just learned of the confession " coincidentally " from an officer in the courthouse cafeteria . The confession had been obtained by two officers directly working with Sanders and Hendrix on the case . <p> CONFLICTING TESTIMONY <p> In his confession , Ricard contradicted the girls ' testimony , saying the chase began at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lane . <p> Ricard said neither Goff nor Tennison were at the parking lot where Shannon was killed . <p> " They had him in a corner , and they was beating him up , " Ricard told police . " I got out the truck , jumped out the back of the truck with the gun . And when I pointed it at him , everybody cleared back , and I shot him . " <p> Ricard said he was confessing because " it 's been bothering me . I 'm trying to do the right thing . Two of my friends ( Goff and Tennison ) are going down for something I did , and I just wanted to get it cleared up . I want it cleared . " <p> But Ricard refused to testify at the hearing , and the judge denied Tennison 's request for a new trial , finding that Ricard 's taped statements were inadmissible and untrustworthy . Sanders told the court at the time that Ricard was one of Tennison 's fellow gang members and that his confession was " an effort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Over the next decade , Tennison repeatedly appealed his conviction without success . <p> But in 2000 , the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco ordered a hearing , saying Tennison had found new evidence . Attorneys Peters and Balogh took his case pro bono , and a federal magistrate allowed them to examine previously secret police files and question Sanders and others involved in the case . <p> In their resulting court papers , Tennison 's lawyers said they had discovered new evidence of police misconduct . The court papers were first reported in the Bay Guardian on March 5 . <p> WITNESS PROGRAM <p> According to the papers , Sanders and Hendrix secretly paid $2,500 from a " Secret Witness Program " to one or both of the girls who testified against Tennison . <p> In a December 2001 deposition , Hendrix denied the existence of a Secret Witness Program and that he or Sanders had sought money from it for the Shannon case . Hendrix said he avoided giving such rewards because it could taint the witness ' testimony . <p> But Hendrix admitted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyers showed him an Oct. 4 , 1989 , police memo , in which the inspectors said they needed the money to encourage witnesses to come forward . <p> Hendrix said he could not recall discussing the payment of a $2,500 reward with any witness , adding that Sanders had prepared the request . Sanders was not asked about the fund at his deposition . <p> In court papers defending the conviction , the state attorney general 's office admitted that the prosecution should have disclosed the inspectors ' request for reward money , but argued there was no evidence the money was actually paid . <p> Tennison 's lawyers claim the prosecution also pressured the 14-year-old girl to testify against him , even after she repeatedly insisted she was not at the scene of the crime and had not seen the killing . <p> The lawyers claim that as part of this coercion , the police gave her a polygraph test that was not disclosed to Tennison 's trial lawyers . <p> In his deposition , Hendrix initially denied ordering the lie detector test for the girl , then admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police memo about it . <p> The state attorney general 's office conceded that the prosecution did not tell Tennison 's trial lawyers about the polygraph test , but said Hendrix " may have simply forgotten " about it . <p> The state argued that the failure to disclose the test did not deprive Tennison 's trial lawyers of a chance to challenge the girl 's credibility . <p> NEW WITNESS <p> While police were allegedly pressuring the girl to testify against Tennison , a young woman named Chante Smith was telling Sanders they had the wrong man . <p> Several months before trial , Smith met with Sanders and Hendrix . She claimed she was not present at the crime scene but knew the killer was Lovinsky Ricard . <p> In a 1992 statement to police , Smith went further : She admitted that she had seen the killing . <p> Like Ricard in his confession , she said the chase began at a 7-Eleven on Bayshore Boulevard and ended with Shannon 's dark-colored Skylark crashing in reverse before he was cornered . <p> " I then saw Ricard with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People backed away , and I heard a shot and saw Ricard return to the area of the truck with the shotgun , " she said in a 2001 declaration affirming her 1992 statement . <p> Sanders ' notes of her initial phone call were turned over to the defense only in 2001 , after a federal magistrate ruled that Sanders apparently had conducted an interview of Smith before trial that was not disclosed . <p> Tennison 's lawyers now claim that had the prosecution disclosed Smith 's identity before trial , lawyers could have investigated her information . <p> " Chante Smith was the thread that , when pulled , would cause the prosecution 's case against Tennison to unravel , " they said . <p> The state attorney general 's office argued in court papers that because police believed Smith 's information was not trustworthy , the prosecution had no duty to reveal it . <p> In his December 2001 deposition , Sanders said he considered Smith unreliable and that he suspected she and Ricard were part of a gang plot to disrupt the case against Tennison . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " should have been turned over and that he thought they had been . <p> " This was some very dynamite , for lack of a better adjective , information , if it were true , " Sanders said.E-mail Seth Rosenfeld at **26;10160;TOOLONG
