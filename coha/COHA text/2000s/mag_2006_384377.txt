This season 's highlights include SITE Santa Fe 's Sixth International Biennial , as well as the inauguration of a long-overdue Biennial of Contemporary Indigenous Art-an alternative and much broader fine-arts contemporary counterpart to the city 's decades-old Indian and Spanish Art Markets and to the relatively recent International Folk Art Market . In addition , and due in part to the city 's recently intensified aim of promoting its art scene as a major contributor to the town 's economic profile , the once controversial downtown Railyard District project , first conceptualized in 1995. has finally broken ground . Overseen by the Santa Fe Railyard Community Corp. , the plan calls for the development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new venue for the Farmers ' Market , as well as live/work studios for artists . The Railyard District ( about half a mile from the city 's main historic plaza ) is surrounded by cultural institutions such as SITE Santa Fe , Warehouse 21 and El Museo Cultural . The much anticipated commuter rail service between Albuquerque and Sante Fe , scheduled to begin in 2007 , will make its primary stop there . The city has appointed the Trust for Public Land to oversee the S12-million implementation of a new two-acre plaza and 10-acre city park designed by architects Ken Smith and Frederic Schwartz and artist Mary Miss . All these developments have been catalysts for the relocation of a number of contemporary art galleries to the Railyard District , which some members of the city 's artistic community are now referring to as Santa Fe 's Chelsea . In the Museums Coinciding with the opening events of SITE 'S biennial is the multi-venue show " Renters : An Aesthetic Insertion , designed to reflect the economic struggles as well as often transient status of the city 's local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to relocate . Organized by local artists Merchant Adams and Jennifer Joseph , the show will feature multi-media work by over 30 emerging New Mexico artists displayed in a traveling caravan of U-Hauls that will make several stops : the SITE Santa Fe parking area , the Center for Contemporary Art ( CCA ) , and varying sites along Cerillos Road , among others .

The show , though titled , is themeless , and the number of participating artists has been drastically reduced . In an attempt to lessen the numbing effect and diminished viewing potential of today 's jam-packed biennials , Ottmann has chosen only 13 artists-using the mediums of photography , installation , painting , performance art , soundscapes , sculpture and video-whose works will be displayed in what will essentially constitute a cluster of solo exhibitions . Ottmann explains , " This biennial attempts to insert a temporary still point between Presence and Presentation in the hope that some viewers will experience art more fully by encouraging a more personal and direct engagement with the works on view .
