Chapter One At the moment when Scott Early killed Becky and Ruthie , I was hiding in the shed . It was n't because I was afraid . I was n't afraid to die then , and I 'm not afraid now . It was because we were playing hide-and-seek . My little sisters always started begging me the minute my parents left me to baby-sit . " Ronnie , Ronnie , Ronnie ! " they would tease me , pulling on my shirt while I tried to straighten up the kitchen , " Betcha we can find you this time . Betcha on our chores ! " And I would always give in , warning them that if they did n't find me , they were going to spend two hours , until Mama got back , picking up every crayon and every sticker book in their room . " This time I 'm not kidding , Thing One and Thing Two , " I told them that day . " I 'm not going in there right before Mama gets home and pull all your clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I promise , slalomly , " Becky said . I had to laugh . Her teeth were purple from the berries she 'd eaten for breakfast . Becky was as thin and fast as a minnow in a creek and seemed to live practically on air . Ruthie was as round and " slalom " as a little koala bear . Her favorite thing was to eat cookie dough right from the bowl . They wanted to play outside , because it was a really warm , sunny day for November , not that it'sever too cold at the edge of what 's practically the Mojave Desert . The purples and yellows and reds of the changing trees that day were as flashy as a marching band . And so , an hour later , I was crouched down in the shed , behind a big sack of potting soil and a crate of clay , hoping a spider did n't pick that time to crawl up my back . I could n't see my little sisters . But I imagined that they were leaning against the picnic table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bugs were n't bad - our own tomatoes and sweet corn , sometimes with tacos and black beans - listening to the birds making their go-to-sleep sounds . Becky and Ruthie most likely had their little hands over their eyes , counting fast so that they could yell out , " Ready or not , here I come ! " Ruthie would call first , I knew . She always did , and Becky always shushed her , saying there was no way she could have gotten to a hundred yet because she , Becky , was older and she had n't got up to fifty . I know they did n't peek , because I 'd told them peeking was n't fair , and that I would n't play unless they played fair . That day , though , they never made a sound . I figured they were counting to a hundred silently , because whenever we played hide-and-seek , Becky would count straight up as fast as she could , and Ruthie , who was only four , would say out loud , " One , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ten . " Becky would get so confused she 'd have to start all over again . But five minutes went by , and still , they never made a sound . When it got to be a long time , I opened the door . And I saw my sisters , lying there like little white dolls in great dark pools of paint . I saw Scott Early , a young man with short blond hair , sitting on the picnic table , wearing only his underwear , sobbing as if they were his little sisters , as if a terrible monster had come along and done this . Which was sort of what he did think , though I did n't know that then . It was a good thing , a doctor later said to my mother , that Becky and Ruthie did n't cry out . It meant that they died quickly . They barely felt a thing . They must never have heard Scott Early come walking barefoot across our lawn . The merciful Father shielded them from fear . Being cut across the carotid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that , even then , from biology . But it 's not over in an instant , and I prayed for months that Becky and Ruthie never had time to wonder why I was n't there to help them . For I was always there to help them . Though I was only twelve-almost-thirteen , Mama could trust me to look after the little girls alone , even if she had to be out in the part of the shed that was her " studio " or at the galleries , as far away as St. George , for hours at a time . " You are as responsible as any mother , Ronnie , " Mama quietly told me one night , after the time Becky 's hand got burned . Becky had been impatient that morning for her " cheesy eggs , " and reached up to see if they were finished while I was cooking . She burned her hand on the pan . Mama said I had " presence of mind " because I did n't start to cry or panic when Becky screamed . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which my own grandma would have done , because that would have made it worse . From the firstaid section of health class Mama taught me , I remembered that a burn had to be cooled down with water right away or the heat inside would keep right on burning the skin and the damage would go deeper . I put Becky 's hand under the cold-water tap for five minutes and wrapped ice in a thick towel and taped it down around her hand . Then I ran , pulling Becky and Ruthie in the wooden wagon , down to our nearest neighbor , Mrs. Emory , who drove us to Pine Mountains Clinic ten miles away , between our house and Cedar City . At the clinic , the doctor , a young woman , placed a net shield and gauze under a bandage on Becky 's palm . The doctor spoke so gently to Becky that I suppose it was then that I first thought I would become a doctor one day myself . I wondered if the incident meant I was called to it . Becky had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healed . Our pediatrician , Dr. Pratt , said he would n't have done one thing different himself , except to drive her to a hospital . But there was n't a real hospital within fifty miles of where we lived at the foot of a pine-covered ridge . Where we lived was n't even really a town . It was a sort of settlement , for people like my father , who always said he liked his " elbow room . " And so , on the day they died , unless paramedics could have arrived at our house within minutes ; and everyone knew that was impossible , or unless there was a doctor already at our house ; and I was just a child , and Mr. Sissinelli , our neighbor , who was a doctor , was at his hospital , no one could have saved my sisters . I must not feel guilty , Mama and Papa told me over and over , in the days afterward , although I could see in their eyes and hear in their voices that they felt exactly that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable to call for help until it was too late , or for being unable to get Papa 's gun because he was out hunting for quail , they said . By the time I opened the door on the sight that would change me for the rest of my life , it was already too late . When the police asked questions about why we were n't supervised , my parents spoke up . They defended me and their choice of leaving me to watch my sisters , telling the officers what a responsible girl I was . I had done just what I should have done . I had been brave . They said that not even a parent could have suspected that Scott Early would even find such a remote place , much less grab the weeding scythe Papa had left leaning against the barn and use it like the sword of an avenging angel , striking a death blow in seconds . I listened and I nodded , but I did n't really believe them . I did n't want to cause Papa , and especially Mama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't guilty . My cousins , and my best friends , Clare and Emma , and even goofy boys like Finn and Miko , said the same thing . But it did n't matter . Even after the panic was gone , and the worst of the agony , the guilt was always there . It could never be turned off . The guilt was like using a plain magnifying glass to focus a beam of sunlight , bringing all that heat together , turning something soft and bright into something that could hurt . Even love could n't dim it . It was the guilt that made my anger like a burn that no one ever ran under cold water ; and so it kept burning and burning down to my bones . And as time went by , and other peoples ' cooled down , mine did not . It got hotter , and became a part of me , and it did n't heal until long after . Even now , I think the scars must still be there . ( Continues ... )   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
