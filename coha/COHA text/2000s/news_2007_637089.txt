<p> THRIVE 101 Marietta St. *** <p> DOWNTOWN ATLANTA has a weird reputation when it comes to restaurants . No one seems to want to eat there , unless they are stepping out of their downtown office for lunch . You hardly hear of folks in Midtown , Buckhead or Alpharetta driving downtown for lunch  --  or dinner . It 's usually the other way around . <p> It 's a shame , really , since there are a few spots worth the effort . Les Fleurs de Lis Cafe , in the Healey Building , is a great little French bistro with an enigmatic chef , Lenny Robinson , and a menu as good as many in Paris . Rosa 's Pizza is the best carb load in the ATL . And now Thrive , which is smart enough to offer valet parking ( a must downtown ) and a menu created by Posh chef de cuisine Ian Winslade , is trying to do what its monosyllabic name implies . <p> On most accounts , Thrive succeeds . It 's hard  --  very hard  --  not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stools , plush window banquettes and honey-combed ceiling ( all designed by the Johnson Studio ) to B.E.D. , with the high-concept party pad that was inside the Glenn Hotel across the street . In spite of its tables-for-beds concept that seemed just right for the crowds that linger downtown after dark , B.E.D . lacked the two most important components of success in the restaurant business : good food and welcoming hospitality . Thrive appears to provide both . <p> It takes guts to open an upscale restaurant , bar and lounge in what was once a Gorin 's , where there 's no free parking for customers ( hence the free valet ) or employees , and where no one wants to come unless they are already there . What Thrive has going for it is a local edge  --  general manager and partner A.D. Allushi is a Buckhead Life alum and owner Jeff Safari , who , among other things , owns the incredibly successful nightclub Compound . <p> But it is Allushi who is constantly present , floating among tables , talking to guests and offering tastes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than three years ) , bringing sushi to the table along with a server , or making one of his excellent cappuccinos ( he 's Italian , so go figure ) . Thrive seems to be his baby , and he is constantly caring for it like a doting father . <p> Winslade 's menu comes across a little cheeky at first , kind of like offerings found on a catering menu for a party at a golf club . But after a second glance there is almost a feng shui genius to its polar oddities  --  elbow macaroni with cheese and bits of ham sounds downright pedestrian until you taste and it becomes a creamy-vs. - salty mess of something you want to just smear around and have fun with . Shrimp cocktail , on the other hand , is a delicate offering of plump shrimp in a salad of buttery avocado and diced tomatoes with a spicy-sweet sauce peppered with horseradish . <p> In the kitchen is Oscar Pinto , who worked first at Tom Tom , then Bluepointe , then Sia 's in Duluth . Pinto seems to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though fried calamari and crab cakes lack any sort of personality , red curry mussels have a spicy coconut milk broth , a little like a good massaman curry . And a cornmeal-crusted , deep-fried grouper sandwich loaded with fried green tomatoes and Thousand Island dressing is a huge bite of yum made for making a mess . <p> Sushi is a big part of the menu created by David Lam , formerly of Twist , and Victor Hernandez of Bluepointe . ( This is Atlanta after all , so where would we be without sushi ? I 'm surprised it 's not on the menu at Pricci . ) Here it seems to fit , since most of the menu 's success lies in small things to eat , not entrees , which for the most part seem to drown in mediocrity  --  grilled grouper with rice and coconut curry ( which works with the mussels ) is gummy and too sweet ; spaghetti with cream and tomatoes is overcooked and boring ( unlike the mac-n-cheese ) . <p> On a night when something is happening at Philips Arena , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Hawks game the restaurant was packed wall to wall with very tall , well-dressed people . So if you 're looking to people spot , Thrive is a good bet . <p> And if you 're looking to eat downtown , there 's hardly a better choice . <p> THRIVE <p> Overall rating : *** <p> Food : Modern American <p> Service : A little green around the edges , but everyone here is trying to do a good job , even on crazy nights when it 's really crowded <p> Address , telephone : 101 Marietta St. , 404-389-1000 <p> Price range : $$-$$$ <p> Credit cards : Visa , MasterCard , American Express , Diners Club , Discover <p> Hours of operation : Open for lunch Monday through Friday from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m .
