Editor - I understand the importance of the auto industry and its many suppliers and dealers to our economy and manufacturing base . I recognize that a bankruptcy by any of the Big Three will inevitably result in great pain to families and communities all across America . <p> I have seen claims that a bankruptcy would cost many times more than $25 billion in unemployment compensation , lost tax revenues and other costs , but I do not know how those figures are arrived at . <p> Here 's what I do n't understand : Ford burned through $7.7 billion in the last quarter , 30 percent of $25 billion . GM burns through $1 billion plus each month , 50 percent of $25 billion each year . Chrysler had $11 billion in cash about two months ago , but it is burning through it . <p> In the face of this appalling waste , what difference will $25 billion make ? Let 's not kid ourselves : $25 billion is a down payment . What 's the final price , including sales tax , license fees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Oakland <p> Editor - So GM wants us to bail them and the United Auto Workers out ? The UAW states that they can not give any more concessions below $74-an-hour total wages , including retirement and benefits . <p> What are they smoking ? A union carpenter in San Francisco makes around $55 an hour with benefits and retirement , while production line workers in Detroit make $20 an hour more ? <p> What 's wrong with this picture ? <p> Not only that , but the housing prices in Detroit are one half or less what they are here . Where can I sign up to work in Detroit ? <p> DAVID LYON <p> San Mateo <p> Editor - As Congress lectures Detroit about mismanagement , perhaps it should be remembered that this was the sequence : Big Auto lobbies Washington to allow SUVs to be classed as trucks . Congress acquiesces . Car salesmen all over America tell buyers they can write off their SUVs in as little as three years . SUVs , er , TUVs , are esssentially free . Carmakers have instant profit margins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Would any self-respecting CEO turn down this candy ? So when our present Congress now looks around for scapegoats , perhaps they should look in the mirror . <p> BOB BURGER <p> Berkeley <p> Editor - In the Barbary Wars of 1803 and 1815 , Stephen Decatur led the fledgling U.S. Navy against the pirates of Tripoli , successfully ending their reign of terror in the Mediterranean . <p> It seems inconceivable that 200 years later , the scourge of piracy should return as a international maritime threat , yet it has . <p> Yes , the times are different and the situation complex , yet we yearn for the will and courage of a Stephen Decatur to once again rid the seas of these criminal parasites and assert the power of the rule of law over chaos and barbarism . <p> STEVE ABNEY <p> San Francisco <p> Editor - Last week , a train operator had BART police escort me and my folding bicycle from the lead car . Bicycles are prohibited in lead cars because they may obstruct the train operator in case of emergency . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both significantly larger than my folded bike . <p> The incident made me wonder why BART makes life hard for cyclists . I have to schlep my bike up long stairs , or wait for the stinky elevator . Full-size bikes are prohibited from peak hours . Inside the train , there is no provision for stowing your bike out of people 's way . It does n't seem like BART is encouraging folks to ditch cars for bikes . <p> I would love to see more people biking to work and school , but that will not be facilitated by BART . For now , people like me will always be few , marginal and discouraged from what we do . <p> GING-LI WANG <p> Oakland <p> Editor - Federal , state and city budget shortfalls abound . Political discussion is cheap ; we need a new tax source . Why not gasoline ? <p> Gas prices have recently fallen by nearly $2 a gallon . If that drop in price were replaced by a $2 gasoline tax $1 to the state , $1 to the feds , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focused on driving less and purchasing small , more fuel-efficient cars . <p> JAMES THURBER <p> Mountain View <p> Editor - There is one certain way to fix the economic crisis in this country . We could start immediately and would be out of our predicament in a very short period of time . <p> End the war in Iraq . <p> This will save our once great nation over a $12 billion per month , not to mention the countless and priceless lives that would be saved along the way . Sounds like a win-win situation to me . <p> MARC GROAH Healdsburg <p> Editor - President Bush got so much wrong after 9/11 . In collusion with zealous oil company execs , his administration refused to analyze how our presence and policies in the Middle East , based primarily upon our need for barrels and barrels of oil , precipitated the terrorist attack on our soil . There was no way that the U.S. government or the people of this country were going to admit any culpability for setting our country up for attack . We were the innocent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To deal with the aftermath of our national tragedy , Bush urged us all , as patriots , to go shopping for , among other items , bigger and bigger vehicles . SUVs , after all , would undoubtedly supply a false sense of safety and security to a shaken population- which of necessity only further increased our dependence on that very same foreign oil . Consequently , oil companies have been reaping obscene profits . <p> The same can not be said for other economic sector , s and the question must be asked : <p> Would the auto industry be in such bad shape now if , instead , Bush had actually stepped up to his responsibilities as leader of our country and , rather than kowtowing to the oil companies , had ordered an immediate revamping of American car manufacturing to sharply reduce our addiction to foreign oil ? With 9/11 , we got a huge wake-up call , which corporate America , aided and abetted by our incompetent , profit-at-any-cost Republican administration , purposefully chose to dismiss at great risk to the national economy . And now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off into the sunset . <p> NOELLE ROBBINS <p> Alameda <p> Find Documents with Similar Topics Help Below are concepts discussed in this document .
