<p> The three artists in " Midnight 's Daydream " were all artists in residence this past year at the Studio Museum in Harlem , but they take very different approaches to making art . <p> Titus Kaphar is the classicist : taking as his starting point European and American portrait paintings from the 18th and 19th centuries , he makes oil-on-canvas copies and reconfigures them in strategic ways . Wardell Milan II is the collagist : some of the show 's best works are the digital C-prints he creates from family photos , art reproductions and images cut from magazines . And Demetrius Oliver is the Conceptualist : using spare photographs and staking his claim on signature materials like coal and tea kettles . <p> For " Conversation Between Paintings No. 3 : Descent " Mr. Kaphar created a diptych by placing a copy of Sir John Baptiste de Medina 's portrait " James Drummond , 2nd Titular Duke of Perth , " of 1700 , alongside a copy of Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson 's portrait " Jean-Baptiste Belley , " of 1797 . <p> But his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the lower lefthand corner of the Medina painting , and Belley , a Senegalese-born former slave elected to the 1793 National Convention in Paris , has been inverted so that he now faces Drummond , a white man . The excised figure , a young black man looking up in admiration at Drummond , has been painted into the Belley portrait , changing the relationship between all the figures . <p> Another recognizable image used by Mr. Kaphar is Marie-Guillemine Benoist 's " Portrait of a Negress " ( 1800 ) in the standard reclining-nude format . Pinned like a paper doll to the woman 's breast is a copy of " Vice-Admiral George Darby , " by George Romney , an arrangement that sets up a dialogue about art , sex , race and representation . <p> Mr. Kaphar has made two graceful sculptures by removing canvases from their stretchers , crumpling them and displaying the objects in plexiglass boxes . Titled " Aftermath : Artifact , " each one features a painted portrait face that peers out from the folds of the canvas like a captive inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Fred Wilson , and his classical-painting roots call to mind Kerry James Marshall and Kehinde Wiley , but he is adept at juxtaposing his sources in collagelike fashion . <p> In the context of this show , Mr. Milan is the archetypal collagist . In " Day Dreaming : I dream of you beneath the flowers , for a couple of hours . Such a beautiful day , " an orgy of images  --  wrestlers , boxers , smiling relatives , stock cars , Giovanni da Bologna 's " Rape of the Sabines "  --  is crammed into a backyard setting . Nestled into the composition is a self-portrait of Mr. Milan , eyes closed , day-dreaming the dream of the artwork . <p> His series of collages titled " Battle Royale " consists of cuts and rearrangements made to black-and-white photographs of boxers like Jimmy Slade , Floyd Patterson , Ike Williams and Sugar Ray Robinson . The family and sports photos and his explorations of black male sexuality echo the work of artists like Lyle Ashton Harris and Glenn Ligon  --  who wrote the essay introducing Mr. Milan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Paul Pfeiffer 's videos in which sports figures are isolated from their surroundings . <p> Mr. Milan 's photographed collages include a wealth of images and a pile-up of references , everything from the Kennedys and Martin Luther King Jr . to Rogier van der Weyden 's " Deposition . " But his graphite and charcoal drawings , which recall classical nude battle scenes and are titled after the Tennessee Williams short story " Desire and the Black Masseur , " are comparably one-dimensional . <p> Mr. Oliver is best known as a maker of spare photographs that accomplish much with very little , as with his photograph " Till " ( 2003-5 ) , in which he covered his head with chocolate frosting to commemorate the 1955 Mississippi slaying of Emmett Till , a black teenager who was said to have whistled at a white woman . <p> Here Mr. Oliver uses photography and sculpture to extend his participation in a kind of trickster Conceptualism in the mold of Duchamp and , more pointedly , David Hammons . ( A photograph of the show 's three young artists shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , black and green " African-American Flag , " and Mr. Oliver is turned toward the flag , as if saluting it . ) <p> Two works by Mr. Oliver that seem to be direct nods to Mr. Hammons are " Midnight , " a blue blazer decorated with small white Christmas lights , and " Mimic , " a tea kettle outfitted with a hidden soundtrack of a human whistle . <p> Mr. Oliver is also increasingly exploring in the vein of artists like Joseph Beuys by staking a claim on signature materials . For Beuys those materials included fat , felt and sleds , recalling aspects of his rescue in World War II . For Mr. Oliver , bacon , coal and tea kettles are totemic ( although their significance to him is not as clearly identified ) . <p> In the 44 photographs that make up " Almanac , " Mr. Oliver 's studio is reflected in the convex surface of a tea kettle . In every photograph a few objects sit in the foreground : light bulbs , a gas lantern , strips of bacon draped over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Oliver 's finger . Coal makes its appearance in " Orbiter , " a slide projected against the wall in which a piece of coal encircled by a hand creates a kind of eerie black hole . <p> In the catalog , Christine Y. Kim , the Studio Museum 's associate curator and the show 's organizer , links the works of Mr. Kaphar , Mr. Milan and Mr. Oliver by describing their daydream quality , that " tacit state of reflection " that comes on at midnight , " the witching hour . " That could be one poetic similarity , if a bit nebulous . <p> More evident is the way these three artists actively confront race and ( art ) history  --  which often seems like a mandate for young black artists  --  and how their work both borrows , and tries to separate itself , from their recent predecessors , many of whom were also artists in residence at the Studio Museum . <p> " Midnight 's Daydream : Titus Kaphar , Wardell Milan II and Demetrius Oliver , 2006-07 Artists-in-Residence " continues through Oct. 28 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street ; ( 212 ) 864-4500 , studiomuseum.org . <p> #
