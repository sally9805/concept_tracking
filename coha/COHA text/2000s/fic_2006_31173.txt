CHAPTER I Sometimes , just to get my bearings , I think back on the sheer ordinariness of that morning in September . Betsy left before light to start her shift at the Jump Start Restaurant over on 70 . I watched her moving through the bedroom , a familiar shadow in the familiar dark . She did n't need to turn on any lights to know where she was and did n't want to because she did n't want to wake me . My eyes were open , as they always were whenever she stirred , but my head was heavy in the pillow and I was as still as a stone in a churchyard . She leaned over and kissed me so lightly that I was n't sure if I felt her lips or her breath , and she whispered to me , " Kurt , darling , do n't let Miriam sleep too late . " She stood up for a second , then leaned back down . " Love you , Baby , " she said , and she was gone . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour later , and I watched the windows take shape as shadows on the opposite wall . But still , I did n't move . There was no work for me today , and I no longer had the energy or the will , or saw the purpose , of saying prayers . The idea passed through my mind , as ideas do in the early morning , that love had taken the place of faith . And if that was so , then so be it . Miriam was in her room , too big for her baby bednow . Her Disney Pocahontas nightgown was all scrunched up around her , and her hair was damp . I like for us to sleep with the windows open and the night air moving through the screens . But last night was too hot for that , I thought . Too hot . And she was so peaceful in the dawn cool . She could sleep as long as she wanted . My baby here in my house in my old hometown in Kansas . Nobody and nothing was going to disturb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door made a little noise when it opened . I drank the milk out of the carton , then poured myself some of the coffee that Betsy had brewed . The little countertop television was turned on without the sound . She 'd just watched it for the time and the weather maps . She did n't care what anybody on it had to say . And now I watched it , too , silently . Smiling faces . Everyone so happy in the morning . So happy . I put a couple of Eggos in the old toaster . The smell of them warming filled the kitchen . The faces on the television were n't smiling now . Katie Couric looked like something had gone really wrong with her day . And Matt , too . I 'd never seen him so serious , unless it was when they were talking about colon cancer . That 's how ordinary the morning seemed . With the sound turned off , just watching their lips move , I thought they were talking about cancer . Or anorexia . Or maybe the death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they showed the New York skyline , and the World Trade Center towers . One of them was burning . Smoke was pouring out of it in every direction , worse than one of those hotel fires in Vegas , billowing up the sides of the building in gray waves of soot . A shape passed through the corner of the frame , and the second tower exploded . It must have been thirty minutes later , maybe an hour , when Miriam came into the kitchen . She was headed for the refrigerator . She looked at the TV and paid it no attention . She pulled the milk carton off the shelf . She looked at me . She waited for me to say no , and when I did n't , she drank out of the carton , spilling a little on each side of her face . She put the milk back , clumsy and dainty at the same time , and she dragged her chair over to the counter , and climbed up to get a paper towel so she could wipe her face , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In case I did n't notice , she held up the paper towel for me to see before she put it in the trash under the sink . I remember all that now , but it was as if I did n't see Miriam when she was there in front of me . The first Trade Center tower had collapsed , and now the second one was coming down . Thousands would be dead . Maybe tens of thousands . " Do you want to watch cartoons ? " I said . " Uh-hunh . " I surfed through the channels , but every one of them was showing the collapse of the towers . Finally I reached the Cartoon Network . " There you go , Sugar . Top Cat . I 'm going to go out to the garage for a few minutes . " " Daddy ? " " What , Sugar ? " " Can I turn on the sound ? " " Loud as you want , " I said . " Loud as you want . " The garage was my workshop . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wood and veneer for the kitchens I install . Against one wall sat a big old lift-top freezer that looked like it might once have held Cokes and Yoo-Hoos in some out-of-the-way general store , which it had , but now there were metal straps on the top and the sides that were held together by a big padlock . If anybody asked , I told them that was so Miriam did n't think about playing in there , and everybody understood that . I found the key where I had left it , under the bottom tray in my toolbox , and slipped it into the lock . It did n't budge . I turned it harder and felt the metal of the key start to give . Gentler now , I shook it in the lock , slid it a little out , a little in , the key quivering in my grip until the mechanism gave a click , and turned , and the lock sprung open . I felt a rush of satisfaction . " Still got a touch , " I said out loud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lungs until I was breathless .  - -   - -  Folks who go to the Jump Start for coffee in the morning feel kind of possessive about it , like only Westfielders would go there . It 's not a franchise , not part of a chain . It 's just part of our town . On days when I was working , I 'd take Miriam over and drop her off about eight , just as the last customers were pulling out of the lot . But this morning , even at nine-thirty when we got there , the lot was full , and there was a crowd inside staring at the little television on the bracket above the counter . " Oh , my Sugar ! My Darling , " said Betsy . I had Miriam in my arms and my wife threw her arms around both of us , stretching to pull us toward her like a woman who thought she 'd lost her family forever . Tears were pouring down her cheeks . " This is the most horrible thing I ever imagined . " " It 's like Judgment Day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brother , " came a voice that I did n't think I knew from among the television watchers . " It 's like Judgment Day for some people , " I told Betsy , lowering my voice and passing our daughter over into her arms . " But not for us . " Betsy rubbed her eyes . " You mind if I get a couple of Cokes out of the back ? " I said . " You have no shame , " she said . " I 'm just thirsty . " " Well I do n't want to know about it . " " I 'll put them in here , " I said , holding up my battered old JanSport daypack . The freezer in the Jump Start is a big one . You ca n't exactly walk into it , but to get to some of the rear shelves you have to kind of squeeze in . The back corners of it , I 'm sure , have n't been seen by any employee , much less any health inspector , since Kansas was Indian Territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire extinguisher bottle with no nozzle out of my pack and pushed it to the very back of the very top shelf , then shoved a bag of ice in front of it . " You get what you wanted ? " Betsy asked me when I came back out . " Is a six-pack too much to take ? " " Baby , nobody 's going to notice nothing like that missing today . And not for a long time to come . " On the morning of September 12 , at a little after two , when even the neighbor 's dog would usually be asleep , I heard the knock on the door that I 'd been waiting for , heavy and insistent . Betsy shouted out in her dream , not sure if she 'd heard the sound or imagined it . " Do n't you worry , " I told her . " It 's somebody I was expecting . I just thought they 'd show up at a more civilized hour . " " Not some of your damn army buddies . " " Sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep . I 'll try to keep the noise down . " " You better not wake Miriam . " " Shhhhh , " I said . " Shhhh , yourself . " There were two men at the door , both of them wearing loosened ties and white shirts that looked slept in . " Kurt Kurtovic ? " said the older of the two , holding up his FBI credential . " What can I do for you gentlemen ? " " Did you know a David Bigler ? " " My brother-in-law . " " He was killed in 1993 . " I looked at these two under the porch light , one with his hair cut high and tight like a retired drill sergeant , the other younger and Mormonish , a missionary for the law . The moths and gnats hovered in the glare just above their heads . " That 's right  --  1993 . God , that seems like  --  that is a long time ago . Got into some sort of trouble in Atlanta . I 've asked Selma  --  you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , but she does n't tell me anything . Why do n't you ask Selma about it ? " " She said we should come talk to you . " I laughed . " Did she give you guys any coffee ? I 'll bet she did n't . Come on in . " The pot was already brewing . My Betsy must have started it , then gone back to the bedroom . " You 're not surprised to see us , " said High-and-Tight . " I 'm glad to see you . After what happened this morning , I hope you pulled every card on every weird-ass case , every unsolved mystery  --  every X-file you 've got . Dave fits all those categories as far as I can tell . " " What do you remember about the way he died ? " asked the Missionary . " Hell , I do n't know . He and Duke Bolide , who used to work up at the cemetery , they got involved with some kind of crazy religious cult . I mean , even crazier than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to Atlanta . There was a shoot-up ? Was that it ? I do n't remember . But Dave wound up dead in that big CNN building , and some Arab guy got hung from the rafters there . Did they ever find Duke ? We 'd have heard if they did , I guess . " The Feds did n't say anything . " Is that about the way you 've got it ? " " It 's the ' Arab guy ' we 'd like to know more about , " said High-and-Tight . " Ca n't help you . " " Ca n't or wo n't ? " " Ca n't  --  and would like to . But I do n't even know the name of the Arab guy . Was he an Arab guy ? " Continues ...
