Do n't let all the blue on this map fool you : George W. Bush may have a nationwide lead , but he has not locked up the states that will decide the election . Bush is doing best in the West and the Deep South . But Gore has New York and California , which have three more electoral votes than all the Bush states west of the Mississippi . So the most important territory is the Midwest , where Bush 's lead tends to fall within the margin of error . Bush is targeting several other states in the South and the Northwest that have voted for Clinton but have yet to embrace Gore . For Gore , winning the battleground states means solidifying his base  --  especially union voters considering Ralph Nader  --  and attracting moderates . Gore has a shot : some polls estimate as many as half the voters are undecided . <P>  --  By Mitch Frank <P> THE BIG BATTLEGROUND STATES <P> With 106 electoral votes , the Midwest is prized territory .
