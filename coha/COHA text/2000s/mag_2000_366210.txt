For web merchants and shoppers alike , there may be no greater fear than that of credit-card theft . And there is good reason . The idea that millions of credit-card numbers are being beamed to thousands of websites every day must be an irresistible lure to any hacker with a larcenous bent . Last week e-tailers were sweating over reports of an international cybertheft that for pure nerve , craft and brass rivals any ever tried before . If the FBI does n't crack the case soon , skittish consumers , who had just started growing comfortable with the idea of Web shopping , could grow uncomfortable in a hurry . <P> The target of the virtual stickup was a website known as CD Universe , which sells music and DVD movies online . Doing business on the Net since 1996 , CD Universe had served more than 300,000 customers  --  which translates to roughly 300,000 credit-card numbers salted away in its electronic files . Last month the site 's parent company , eUniverse , based in Wallingford , Conn. , was contacted by someone identifying himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have hacked into those files and filched those numbers . The FBI has since asked the company not to reveal whether that communication came by fax or e-mail , but the message was the same . " I found a security hole , " the extortionist wrote . " Pay me $100,000 ... or I 'll sell your cards . " <P> Calling his bluff , eUniverse declined to pay and instead contacted the FBI . Maxus , it turned out , was n't kidding : on Christmas Day , the so-called Maxus Credit Cards Datapipe went into service , offering Web surfers thousands of free , pilfered card numbers at the click of a mouse . It was only last week that a Web-security company alerted eUniverse to the existence of the site , which was quickly shut down . By then , though , 25,000 credit-card numbers had been given away . " Of the card numbers the FBI pulled off the site , " says eUniverse vice president Brett Brewer , " a majority were ones that had been used at CD Universe . " <P> No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no accident . Around the time his site was disabled , he began exchanging cat-and-mouse e-mail with reporters from the New York Times and other newspapers , and his messages appear to originate in Paris . The FBI and various Web experts have been following other electronic bread crumbs he left behind , however , and those point more strongly to Russia or Eastern Europe . An independent Net-sleuth group even claims to have located Latvian and Russian accounts Maxus uses for cash drops . " It 's likely that he 's in Europe , unless he 's really good , " says John Markoff , the Times reporter to whom Maxus sent his e-mail . " And if he 's that skilled , no one 's going to catch him . " <P> That may be bad news for eUniverse  --  and for e-commerce . Representatives of the company have e-mailed customers to alert them to the theft and retained a security firm to prevent their software locks from being picked again . Consumer liability is limited to $50 in most such cases , but e-tailers have no protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stolen . <P> Even as the Web was twanging with news of the Maxus scam , Attorney General Janet Reno proposed a crime-fighting network designed to combat just such cybercriminality . The move may protect the next e-tailer victimized by Net extortion , but it has come too late to help this one . <P>  --  By Jeffrey Kluger
