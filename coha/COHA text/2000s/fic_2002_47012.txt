Every year come springtime , my uncle leads a pilgrimage to Coney Island-for him there 's something magical about the place . Ron Wolfe 's debut in our pages captures some of that magic . A lot of that magic . Ron Wolfe lives in Little Rock , Arkansas , and works as a feature writer and cartoonist for the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette . His fiction has appeared in Twilight Zone and in Asimov 's , his work has also graced the Hellraiser comics , and he collaborated with John Wooley on several horror novels , including : Old Fears and Death 's Door . <p> I LOVED TORI . TORI LOVED Coney Island . The moral is such an old one , maybe you know it already . Do n't take any wooden nickels . Our first time at Coney , I guessed Tori liked slumming . Anything Tori liked was fine with me . Especially when we got there , it was fine with me . The place did something for her , made her the ballerina of the boardwalk . Every wisp of a breeze , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress the color of white sand . She whirled and her hair streamed in waves of blonde , bright as glass in the morning sun . She breathed in the salt air as it mingled with the smells of cotton candy and sea weed and spoilage , and her eyes were like fireworks of green and gold sparks . " See , we are having fun , Brad , " she said . " Did n't I tell you ? Run , silly , catch me ! " I ran , and I caught . Coney 's old parachute drop haunted the beach like a dim metal ghost in the salt haze . The roller coaster was broken . The Wonder Wheel turned its sad , slow revolutions as if it were grinding time to a fine dust . But then , I looked at Tori . She loved it , every bit of it . We ate " Hygrade Frankfurters " from a stand with painted pictures of sausages and pizza and ice cream cones that looked like freak show attractions , and Tori loved it . We saw women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with nipple rings ; and some hunched figure in a filthy ski parka ; and a straw-haired girl in a nothing bikini , just standing there , hands clasped between her breasts in the way she must have learned singing in church ; and the Latina woman with the tragic face , the wet eyes , trying to win a goldfish in a ring-toss game . Cheers and organ music reached us from the new baseball stadium . I imagined a different crowd there : families , boys with baseball heroes , girls with the clean look of suburban shopping malls . Tori would n't go there . " It 's awful , " she said the only time she even glanced toward the stadium , where the Brooklyn Cyclones were winning . The score did n't matter . I do n't know baseball . The Cyclones won just being there , Brooklyn 's first professional baseball team since the Dodgers left forty-five years ago . They meant change . " I want the old- the real Coney Island . Do n't you ? " Tori said , pulling me toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of guns . Old and real is where the fun is all worn out , and marked down , and sold broken with sharp edges to people who ca n't have anything better . But Tori loved it , and so all I saw was Tori . " Did you know ? I have a talent , Brad . A super secret , psychic talent , " she said , making the " s " sounds in " super secret psychic " a conspiratorial whisper . " You could fool me , " I said . We 'd met yesterday . " You tell me the name of the last girl you cared about even a little . I 'll tell you how much she really meant to you . " My tongue caught . " Please ? " " Tori , it was a long time - " " Just her first name . What could a name hurt ? You 'll be surprised how good I am . " " Anna , " I said . Tori took a soft breath , as if breathing in " Anna , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sort my laundry colors , and whose cheeks had blushed when she laughed . " It was n't all that serious , " Tori said , " but , oh ! - she broke your heart . They all break your heart . " I swallowed and tried to smile as if she 'd told a joke , and then did smile , I think , at the flattery that beautiful women trampled through my life - a parade of heartbreakers . I needed Tori 's healing touch , yes , almost a mother 's touch , tracing my face , as if to check me for a fever . " It 's just a game , Brad , silly , " she said . " You try it . Ask me . " " I will . Later , " I lied . We aimed squirt guns into the red-rimmed mouths of plastic clowns , each of us trying to be the first to pop a balloon . Tori brushed my left arm . Crowding me to the right was some withered brown mummy who had shed his ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kid who looked like he might kill somebody if he lost . My pistol was sad to the touch . Nearly all the once-shiny black paint had worn off the grip , and the metal beneath was a dull blue-gray , the color of a bad sky . But Tori aimed well , and her laugh was so high and sweet , I swear even the old guy and the kid threw the contest . They wanted her to win like I did . They wanted to see , like I did , what winning would do for her smile . We all got the prize that day . And then , I asked her . " His name ? " She worked the teddy bear she 'd won like a puppet , making the bear 's head nod as if in greeting to me . " Skip , " she said . " The bear 's name is Skip , too . " Skip , I thought , and I 'm no more psychic than a sidewalk , but something came to me . I swore I 'd never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said , " lots of money , and he knew how to throw it around . " " Could be , " Tori said , and she made the bear say it , too , " He might have been rich . I 'm a rich , rich bear . But I was a long , long time ago . How did you know ? " " Skip ... , " I said . " Skipper , skipper of a yacht , makes him rich Skipper . " The gentleman wins the bear , " Tori said , tucking Skip under my right arm , and then taking my left arm herself , a cool touch of possession . She taught me how to promenade the boardwalk . Casey would waltz With a strawberry blonde , And the band played on -2 We met cute . Does n't everybody ? I 'd been browsing through the sale shelves and boxes in front of the Strand bookstore , 12th and Broadway , that Friday evening . I was working my way from the one dollar books to the forty-eight-centers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ones you had to stoop to , literally - that I found the first book I 'd ever candied and cudgeled through publication years ago as Brad Vogler , Boy Editor . It was a science-fiction paperback called Crimson Cosmos . Then : " Yeww ! " she said , our moment of introduction . My line of sight rose from the book 's clotted red cover to a surprise glimpse down the neckline of Tori 's white shell top ( lacy white bra ; front catch ; first sight of the pendant she always wore , a white disk in a silver mounting ) , and all in a rush : neck-lips-eyes . Ice blue eyes in this light . She did n't see me at all ; she was leaning toward me , staring at the book cover . I felt like I 'd been caught with a dead frog in my hand , just when a barefoot boy finds out nothing matters but girls . " Are you buying that ? " she said . No , I yearned to answer , but I could n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceptance for that book , the first I 'd ever bought . My letter told a fifty-five-year-old newspaper sports reporter in Denton , Texas , that he had sold his novel , his first . I believed I had discovered the next Robert Heinlein , if not the next Norman Mailer , and he thought he had uncovered the next John Campbell . It turned out that all we had found in each other was another paperback book with stock art for the cover : blood oozing down like a sloppy coat of Sherwin Williams , and a couple of flat yellow eyes staring out of the red . But the author had gathered nerve and got married on the strength of that sale , and rounded out his belated brood with two girls adopted from China . He still wrote - high school football scores and " Merry Christmas " in the family photo card he sent me every year . And I could n't say no , so I said something crazy . " I 've read it , but I 'll buy it for you . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Really ! " or " Really .... " or Latin or dolphin talk . I just knew I was being sized up . I paid with a five-dollar bill . Forgot the change . Some eons of floating time later , I woke up having coffee with her , our fingers almost touching across the little table . Talking . Still talking over empty cups . She liked white in the summer , red in the winter ; oatmeal sprinkled with Red Hots , and she did n't like earrings . Mostly , she asked about me . I felt so right with her , I did n't try to sound interesting . Maybe I came off coherent . Listening , Tori withdrew a silver case from her white purse , and a card from the case . The case was inscribed with initials in script , TCS . The card had nothing but her name on it , as if I 'd ever forget Tori Christine Slayton . She added her phone number to the card with a silver pen , slid it to me , and our hands brushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I call you tomorrow ? " I said . " No . Meet me tomorrow . " " Anywhere . " " Brad , silly - 11 A bit of a smile crossed Tori 's face , quick as a butterfly . Then , mock-serious , she said , " You mean that ? Anywhere ? All right , I dare you . " She took back the card , turned it over to plain white and wrote something tiny on the back . She folded the card twice , so I could n't see what she 'd written , and placed it in my hand , folding my fingers over the hard-edged little package with a squeeze . " No fair peeking , " Tori said . " Read it tomorrow morning . Meet me there . We 'll have fun , I promise . " I went strictly by the rules , afraid of breaking the magic spell if I did n't . In the morning , I read the card and caught the subway , a line I 'd never ridden before , to a place I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everybody 's heard of Coney Island . Tori was waiting for me in front of the Headless Woman sideshow . ( " Still alive . See her living body without a head . Alive ! " ) And that was our first time at Coney . I 'll be with you When the roses bloom again -3 Roses . I sent her white roses on Monday . She called ; I called ; she called . We had lunch on Wednesday , a quick bite . She had a small antiques shop on the Upper West Side - high end , American Federal furniture and some Victorian , she said . She was antiques , and me ? - in a way I had n't told her yet , I was collectibles . The comparison was close enough to make me uncomfortable . We arranged to meet again Friday after work in front of the Strand . " Dress up for me , wo n't you ? " Tori said . It seemed to be a hint . Thursday , I laid out the best of my two summer suits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wolfe kept his so clean . Friday , I had the night planned as well as I could . So much about her made thoughts drift away . Her perfume : I fancied it was made of champagne and cinnamon . The way she said my name , the way she played with it , making it sound like an ice cream flavor . The way people watched us , talking when they thought we could n't hear . " ... Vogue , I 'm sure of it . " " ... stare at her , at least close your mouth ..... " " ... Grace Kelly ...... Those same eyes , finding me , blinked and narrowed with itchy guesses . He must be ... her brother . Her boss . He must be rich , but he sure does n't look it . I clean up all right , fair shape for a desk job , and thirty-seven is n't so old . But Tori is twenty-five , twenty-six , close to that , and nobody ever took me to be such great company until she did . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then dinner in the Village , candles and spumoni . I was full of love songs , old ones that I must have half-heard sometime and filed away , just in case I ever felt like grinning like a street loon . Ida , sweet as apple Ci-hi-hi-der -4 Tori had warned me she might be late ; she expected some buyers who liked to haggle at the last minute . Waiting , I made up stories about Brad the Mad . Every now and then , Brad the Mad escaped from the insane asylum , but the police knew where to find him . Whenever he broke loose , Brad the Mad dressed up in a white suit and stood in front of the Strand Bookstore , waiting for the woman who was only a delusion . Tori arrived moments before I conjured up police sirens . She looked laser bright . Somehow , she 'd guessed I would wear white , her color , and her dress was a whipped-cream white linen with a silver chain around the waist , silver bracelets , ornately of antique design ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ivory . It was faintly carved : " Elephas ... " I guess you like the look , " Tori said . I 'd been staring . I rushed into my dinner-and-a-movie plan as if the combination might amaze her . " Could we do the movie another time ? " she said . " I 've missed you , Brad . I just want your attention . " The candles and spumoni part held up , and I caught a break on the waiter . He was gay , and he left us alone . " So , " Tori said , " Mr. Important Book Editor , you still have n't told me enough about your job . " I wished I were a handsome photo on a dust jacket , riding princely over an author 's bio full of lies . He flipped crepes , he topped trees . " English major from Lincoln , Nebraska , seeks literary career , " I said , trying not to shrug . " Braves the big city , finds job as editor with fly-bynight science-fiction and mystery publisher .... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her wineglass , a toast . Her fingernails showed silver edges . " You 've read it ? " I said . " No , but it 's my favorite book . " And that smile again , fire and innocence . " The meteoric rise continues , " I said , " a career arc that takes our hero from rockets and murders , to cookbooks , and then grade school science texts - " She questioned with an eyebrow . " You know what I like about you ? " Tori said . " You have smart eyes . You have n't found your niche yet , but you will . " " - Our Friend Electricity , thank you , please hold your applause . And now , I 'm at Recollections Publishing . I do price guides for nostalgic babyboomers . " " Like ? - " " Jungle Fever : A Collector 's Guide to Tiki . " " Oh , no ! " " Tiki music , tiki dolls , even snow globes . I do n't get it , but there were GIs coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South Pacific . And now , their kids are collecting old tiki stuff all over again . But I do n't feel nostalgia for much of anything . " I caught the mistake . " But I like antiques . " Tori laughed . " Oh , Brad , silly , you do not . I do n't blame you . Antiques are n't nostalgia , antiques are investment . You can love an antique and not like it in the least . " I splashed the last of our bottle , a French Chardonnay that Tori had chosen , into our glasses , and raised mine . " To the brand new , " I said , already planning a second bottle I could n't afford to keep the table and the company . Her expression drifted , blanked for a moment . Her eyes seemed to mist , but it might have been a trick of the candlelight . " I have to go , " Tori said , half rising . My face must have slid into my lap like slush . " Oh my , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She reached across the table to touch my nose , a playful flick . Her finger softly traced a smile across my lips . " Brad , silly . Let me try it again . We should go . " And now , she had neon inside her , excitement that flickered and caught with the words , " Coney Island ! We could , still . " My dumb grin seemed to encourage her . " Tonight . We had such fun the last time , Brad , let 's do it , let 's go . Now . Can we ? " I may have yammered something about the subways being bad at night . But Tori had the answer : She had a car . She knew ways to Coney island , and we could be there in no time . We whisked down the street to her car , if that 's what you 'd call it , parked at the curb between a red Mustang and some blocky sort of coupe . Tori 's car was a low , sculpted swoop of black metal and polished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , metal gave way to the cherry coach , made tight like an admiral 's skiff . It was open-topped , brass- and copper-trimmed , upholstered in leather , and the wheels were wire-rim . The Great Gatsby could have wrestled for the keys to Tori 's car with Deckard from Blade Runner . I set foot on the running board . The car welcomed me like a butler with muscle . The seat had been tailored to me . " It 's a Panhard and Levassor Sport , " Tori said , pulling into the street . " 1914 . Like it ? " " What 's it doing outside the museum ? " She drove fast , as I should have guessed she would , and she knew the streets , how to work the lanes , how to keep moving . I must have looked pale as my suit . " It 's some of the original chassis , but then a lot of restoration , " Tori said . " Not a faithful restoration at all , though . The engine is something else , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even close to the market , some that probably are n't legal . Watch your fingers . " The car seemed to repel other traffic . Even Pakistani cab drivers were afraid to come near it , scared of scratching it . " Do n't worry . It 's not mine , " Tori said . " I borrowed it from one of my customers-part of the deal for an eighteenth-century bedroom set he just had to have . I meet some interesting people . " Next thing I knew , we were sailing over the Brooklyn Bridge , the wind whipping Tori 's hair like white fire ; and then onto the Queens Expressway . We hit 70 , 75 , 80 . Tori 's white scarf streamed , it pulled loose , and I turned to see it go soaring like a ghost into the night . I reached as if I should have caught it , Tori laughing , and me laughing ; and I pulled off my necktie and let that go , too . Mermaid Avenue welcomed us with its offers of saltwater taffy , beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dim lights shone in old windows above the striped and rusted awnings . A gaunt woman stopped to watch us from the sidewalk . Her hair was dyed orange , and she wore a black plastic trash bag twisted elegantly across her shoulders like a feather boa . To her , we were the aliens . I was Bug-eyed Brad from Planet Starbucks . Bug-eyed Brad scans the ruins for life as he knows it , life that bags the trash , that fixes broken windows . But he is the stranger in a strange land of knives and needles . He expects to be eaten . " ... Giuliani saying he wants to make Coney Island something very special again/ can you believe it ? " Tori said . " It 's special the way it is . Special the way it was . Oh , look ! - " We passed the remains of a shabby little candy store . Inside , the shelving and fixtures had been pushed to the center , giving the painters room to work . Already , it had the promise of something the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we turned toward the crawling lights of the old amusement park . Coney Island was a different world in the dark , too bright and too shadowed . It left me straining to recognize anything I 'd seen before . A mist of raindrops fell and passed , cleansing no part of the night . Tori parked facing the roller coaster . High over us , the big letters read " Cyclone " in a way that chilled me like a cold smile : The letters looked eaten away , so many bulbs were dead . But Tori loved it , and I was high from the car ride . We ran like Mouseketeers into Disneyland . The roller coaster was shut down again , or still , but Tori coaxed me onto the Wonder Wheel . " You can see everything from the top , " she promised . At the top , our metal cage groaned and swung over a nightscape more speckled than lit with yellow bulbs and red neon . The rides below us looked tiny and meaningless . We faced toward a jumbled rim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the air smelled fresh . " Feel better up here ? " Tori said , holding my arm , leaning tightly against me . I nodded . " I knew you would , " she said . Her pendant seemed almost to glow . An elephant was carved into the ivory , the creature 's trunk lifted , and the words read , " Elephas non timent . " Tori smiled as if pleased that I 'd noticed . She scooped the pendant lightly in her fingers , holding it toward me . " ' The elephant does not fear , " " she said . " It 's an ancient saying . The elephant 's trunk raised that way means good luck . Long life . Wisdom . " " It looks old . " " Not so very , around 1900 . A century is nothing to an elephant . " " So ! - all this , and she 's an elephant expert , too . What else ? " " Maybe you 'll find out , " Tori said , as the Ferris wheel descended us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We took the funhouse ride into its hell of plywood demons and painted flames , and Tori loved it . We joined a drunken clot of teenagers on a whirligig called the Calypso . I came off with a spattered stripe of something blue and sticky across my left sleeve . " Here , this way , this way ! " Tori said , pulling me . " Let 's see how good you are at Skee-Ball . " The Skee-Ball setup was between a couple other games that had their metal shutters pulled down , scrawled with spray-painted gang signs . We had Skee-Ball to ourselves , just us and the sour yellow glow that spilled over the row of games , and the attendant . He slumped on a dangerously tilted stool at the entrance , head fallen to his chest , asleep or dead . I fished a quarter to drop in the slot that was nicked and dented from all the wasted coins that had gone through it . Nine balls clacked down the chute . Tori bounced on her toes like a little girl trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to catch the mood . We took turns . She rolled a ball , and then I did , and I learned how she played : Anything I scored above a ten was good for a baby hug . The score was eight balls and three little hugs , and I knew how it might feel to hold her . Tori poised the last ball . She glanced at the pink prize tickets that had curled out of the battered machine as we scored . I dreaded waking the attendant to redeem them . " Here 's the prize I want , " she said , turning the hard wooden ball in her hands like it was made of phantom quartz , like it was telling her secrets . " You 'd have to steal it , " I said . " Maybe you 'd steal it for me . " She gave me the ball , wrapping my hesitant fingers around it , and cupping her cool hands over mine . " It 's old , it 's very old , " she said . " I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the hands that have touched it , just like we 're doing . Hundreds , thousands , lives and lives and lives , and every touch leaves something . Every touch tells something . " I may have flinched . Tori 's grip tightened . Her breath came warm , close to my face . " What do you love about a book , Brad ? That it can hold lives ? Well , so can this , only real ones . " She let go , and I saw the ball ; it was the decrepit brown of age and skin oil , nicked , scratched , dented flat in a couple places . " ... he does n't care , " Tori said , eying the big-bellied attendant . He had a Yankees ball cap pulled low . His dark glasses suggested he had been asleep since daylight . He had on a red T-shirt , and a baggy clown 's pair of farm overalls with the ragged legs cut off to make shorts . " Just hold the ball close against your leg , away from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I had n't stolen since college . Petty shoplifting had been a brief , edgy craze in my sophomore year . You 'd ask the check-out clerk what time it was , and in the moment it took her to look at the wall clock behind her , you 'd snitch a pack of Dentyne . You 'd buy a roll of waxed paper , and she 'd never notice that you 'd dropped two slim jars of olives down the cardboard tube . You 'd try for the cigarettes , even though you did n't smoke I was good , and I was caught . A dumb thrill nearly cost my degree . Now , I freak when I 've bought something that accidentally sets off the store alarm . But we passed the attendant . " shhhhh ! " Tori hushed too loudly . He never stirred . We were outside the Skee-Ball game . We were steps away ; we were gone . I gave the ball a tiny flick . It smacked my hand like a soft kiss . I do n't know what roused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh my , oh my , that bad boy 's mad ! ... " Tori warned lightly , as if in answer to an amusing dare . She kicked off her high heels to run . I had no choice . We tore , dodging fat men and slow men and blue jeans , belly buttons , baby carriages , we ran kicking trash , our hands clasped . Her excitement shot me like a current , jolting the fear out of me . This was like another ride to Tori , like the Calypso only faster . But something gripped me . Caught me at the neck . The attendant locked a thick arm around me , holding me back , dragging me down . I lost Tori . He smelled of whiskey and vomit . My knees hit the asphalt , and he was on top of me . He moved to pin my arms and shoulders . I knew this position from grade school : I was going to take a beating in the face . No teacher was going to pull him off me . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my right arm . My fist clenched the ball . I swung at him , catching him hard on the temple with a crack that I only hoped was the ball breaking . But the ball did n't break . He fell beside me , rolling , howling . I pulled to my feet . He made it to his hands and knees , head down , as if he suddenly had decided to study bugs on the ground . With his left hand , he clasped his head . Blood welled between his fingers . A slow drop . A drop , a drop . A stain . For a moment , it seemed that blood was falling all around me . A real rain had begun . Tori shook me , and she caught my hand again , led me and ran with me through the rain and the yells that cracked like thunder , and nobody stopped us . Once we hit the expressway , she slowed below the limit . She let the rain wash me . She swerved off to a gas station , where she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Coke . " See , we are having fun , Brad , " she said , drenched and muddied and altogether the most beautiful blessing I 'd ever imagined . I found something in my hand . The ball . The damned , wonderful ball . I tossed it to her . She was a good catch , too . " Yours , I believe , " I said . Wait till the sun shines , Nellie , And the clouds go drifting by -5 We drove to my apartment in the East Village , listening to cool jazz on the Panhard and Levassor 's Bose FM stereo . A parking space was waiting for us . It was that kind of night . " I have something for you , too , " Tori said . She snapped open the glove box , withdrawing some object she kept hidden . I saw yet another Tori then , one hesitant with a gift , afraid to go through with it , anxious that I would n't like it . What she might have done that I would n't like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I had no wild idea . " Here - " She showed me the copy of Crimson Cosmos I 'd bought her . A smooth bit of cardboard peeked out of the pages . A bookmark . " Pick a card , " Tori said , " any card .... " Withdrawn , it was a Rolodex card . On it , I read the named of a Fifth Avenue publishing house , the first to which I 'd applied for a job in New York , and the one to which I still submitted an updated resume every year . The man 's name on the card , I could no more approach than the planet Venus . Below the name was a number . " He 's been one of my best clients for years , " Tori said . " I 've told him about you . He wants you to call . " My wet thumb smudged the ink on the card , only confirming it was real . " But do n't call him , Brad . Make him call you . That way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I stared at her . She made a cross-eyed face that scattered my dumbfoundedness . " You were right about Skip , " Tori said . " He was rich , and he taught me about winning . So , Brad , silly , are you going to invite a lady in from the rain , or what ? " -6 I used to collect bad writing to share with friends , mostly other bottom-feeders in genre book and magazine fiction . Six or eight of us had a regular beer night at Tad 's Tap on Bleecker Street . We called it the Pen and Pitcher Club . " Her globes suspended from her like bells on a Christmas tree , I mean the fair-sized round kind . " Collector 's price guides do n't produce keepers like that . I quit showing up at Tad 's for being a bore . A few others made the climb to better jobs and bigger publishers . Finally , only the washouts kept the faith . The author of " Her globes suspended ...

And here I am , Tori , dipping my rusty pan into that same flow that ca n't convey the touch of sunlight , or the smell of chocolate , or the taste of tears , hoping for something that gleams. -7 We dripped and squeaked our way up the two flights of stairs to my apartment . As my key clicked the lock , I suddenly wished the door would n't open . My first apartment in New York was in the meat-packing district . I left my shoes inside the door to keep from tracking livestock blood . My second was next to a coke dealer whose clientele was n't much on apologies for having pounded the wrong door . This one , I 'd considered a spectacular move up : three rooms , or four if you count the living room and kitchen as separate because of a shelf divider . The neighbors were reasonably quiet . The previous tenant had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have sat a lot . The lime shag carpet was good as new . One day , I blinked the carpet to oblivion , just quit seeing it Until my door swung open , and I snapped on the light to hit Tori with a sock of green that would have flattened St. Paddy . But the carpet made no impression . " Where 's Skip ? " she said . " Remember me ? Where am I ? " The toy bear . Skip was in the bedroom closet , top shelf , stuffed far in the back . I found him quickly , though , and placed him on the dresser . Tori arranged him with the Skee-Ball between his legs . Wet-haired Tori was in my bedroom , wriggling her toes in the shag . " Let me get you a towel , " I offered . " I 'd like to use the room , " she said . " I need a little more repair than a towel . " I showed her , like there was some trick to finding the bathroom , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cupboard where I kept my mismatched towels ; heard , then , the familiar creak , cry and rattle from the hot water faucet over the tub . Rustling sounds . I stood there , as she must have expected I would . " I knew you 'd have books , " Tori said through the door . " You have wonderful bookcases . " " They 're oak . They 're what I splurge on . " Sound of the faucets turned off . Sound of body in water . " Umm , this feels good , " she said . " You should do this , too . " I glanced back to the bedroom - the neckties that hung off the doorknob , the scatter of socks and magazines in the corner , the whole disarray . I began to scoop and hide . The bathroom door slipped open with a wisp of steam . The dullest part of me expected to see her step out dressed and dried and ready to leave . The rest of my awful imagination conjured up , I do n't know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood gift-wrapped in my best white towel , still sparkling with droplets of water , as if I had this coming - as if I knew what to do with it . " You might try kissing me , " Tori said . I moved to her , my hands finding her warm shoulders , hers finding my face , my neck , my back . The towel fell between us . We transformed my empire 's five steps between bath and bed into another promenade : the lady wearing nothing but her pendant , and her dizzy escort with the ragged knees . Tori made the ceiling light go away . We closed to kiss . The shag carpet worked its magic on us . A stinging blue snap of static electricity sparked between our lips . " Our friend electricity , " Tori said , rubbing her mouth . " Our friend electricity , " I said , pressing mine to the sore spot on hers . Our friend electricity joined us and melted us .

In a gasp , she called me Skip . I tried to pretend I had n't heard . But hard eyes shone on the dresser : Skip watching me . I tried to hide my anger , but it found a way to show . Skip ! " Brad , I 'm sorry .... " Skip ! " Brad , you 're hurting .... " Skip ! " Brad ! Brad ! Brad , silly ... Brad ..... She clung to me , bound to my whim and forgiveness , but I was the one then who could n't let go . I followed her into a soft , singing rhythm , a lullaby whisper . " He was a long time ago - ohh ! - " In the wee small hours of later , I woke to find Tori sobbing . I kissed her neck . I kissed a warm tear . " I do n't care ... , " I said . " He does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is n't you , " she said . " It 's nothing . It 's me . " " Tori - " " They all break your heart .

" Before had been only a taste of her . When I slept again , it was the deep fall of the feasted , and it was knowing that no Annas could ever break my heart again . I slept on the currents of Tori 's breath . Above me , her eyes were the sky . " Tell me what it 's like to dream about Lincoln , Nebraska , " she said . I guess we talked more . In the morning , Tori was gone . I remembered her voice like music through a heavy wall , the rhythm but not the words , not the sense of it . Not then .

I stood there , grinning for a moment , as if she might come to meet me , carrying a picnic basket with a calico cloth . A block west , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to the aquarium , and jostle me back to Astroland , the amusement park , and Sideshows by the Sea . The Human Blockhead had nothing to show me . I looked for her at Nathan 's Famous , where the street comer reeked of wieners and mustard . Two policemen were eating hot dogs , holding their dripping dogs at a distance like medical specimens to keep from staining their blue uniforms . Head down , I hid in the crowd . Damned and Delighted : A Collectors " Guide to Mermaid Avenue . Clean people tried to avoid me . They eyed me the way I had stared at losers on the boardwalk . I found a restroom and checked myself in the tin mirror . Uncombed . Unshaven . I looked drunk . I did what I could with cold water . By evening , I knew where I 'd find her , where I 'd known all along . Look for mermaids in the drowning depths . Thunder snarled as if to remind me of blood and rain , and the possibility that I might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be carrying a sketch of me . Tori stood just under the Skee-Ball sign , wearing the same white dress she had worn our first time at Coney Island . Her ivory pendant gleamed white . To her side , a new attendant watched the games - watched her . He was a shirtless beanpole with his eyes opened wide like a chicken 's . Tori 's left hand braced tauntingly against her hip . Her right hand flipped some tiny thing I could n't see . She came to me with a crystal smile , a face of such delight , I felt the sting of tears . " I won , " she said , kissing the back of her closed right hand . " Take me on the roller coaster , and you can have the prize . " The Cyclone was running . I do n't know how we got there . We waited turn after turn , because Tori wanted the first car . Finally , the train banged to a stop in front of us , and we climbed on . My hands clenched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and warm . " You do n't like roller coasters , " she said , a teasing tone that dropped to something else , something like sadness . " You do n't like any of this , I know . I 'm sorry . " She looked away from me . I felt her tremble as the car jolted forward . It ground its racheta-rakkata way up the first climb . " Here - " Tori said , coaxing my hand loose from the bar . " What I promised you , the prize I won . " I looked at the object she 'd given me . It was a rough wooden disk , with the image of an Indian 's head stamped on one side . Around the head , the letters read : " Do n't take any wooden nickels . " A spatter of rain struck the coin . " For luck , " she said , and her tongue traced my lips . Her body , close against me , told me secrets ; she had nothing else under the dress . She kissed me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook us like a mean dog . It shuddered its timbers , throwing us side to side . Once , it swooped a curve and gave us the same view as from the top of the Wonder Wheel , only better . Someone seemed to have knocked down the buildings like so many blocks . We could see the ocean . Climb . Fall . Curve . Tori shrieked , and the nickel bit into my hand . Climb . Fall . My face stretched back . Curve . I had a sense of shooting past a maze of towers , faces in the windows . The last fall eased into the platform , the end of the ride . But we did n't stop . I saw the crowd , the ride attendants , as smears of surprise . Climb . Tall . Curve . We screamed over the course again . Darkness triggered the lights , and the " Cyclone " sign crackled on . Tori locked close to me . " They 'll stop us , " I said . " They have ways - " She did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . No one tried to stop us . They had no ways at all . Fall . The towers again , become a giant 's garden of lights . We cut through silver curtains of drizzly rain that whipped and stung our faces , and yet , in some crazy way , made us laugh . Curve . We soared over the towers . Ant masses of people swarmed far beneath us . The white lights turned my eyes to burning water . Climb . Fall . Twist . Fracture . Red . Black . Fire . Crystal . Rainbow . Falling . In the air , falling . Casey would waltz With a strawberry blonde And the band played on . He 'd glide cross the floor With the girl he adored And the band played on . Calliope music swirled through my head . I was spinning , up and down , and spinning . I clutched a spiraled pole to keep from losing balance . His brain was so loaded , It nearly exploded . The poor girl would shake With alarm Tori ! " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm here . " Tori ! " Look at me . Look at me . Brad , silly . Please , while you can . " I tried , but the whole world kept revolving . Horses , lions , bears , swans , ran circles around me . He 'd ne'er leave the girl With the strawberry curls I 'd been wrong about the roller coaster . Terribly wrong . We were on a carousel . Mine was the sterling white stallion , and Tori had mastered a gryphon with a golden head , riding perfectly sidesaddle . But Tori was different . Her hair was combed up , arranged into heavy waves under a white hat with a silk bow . Her white dress had full sleeves with lace cuffs and flounced shoulders . The satin skirt swam past her feet . The square-shaped neckline , trimmed with brocade roses , showcased her pendant . But the ivory had fallen out of it , leaving just the silver . A question shaped my mouth , but no words fit the question . Tori said , " This is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached ; I took her hand . The carousel toyed with us . " What was it you said , Brad ? " The girl 's not too bright . " She finally learned the secret . She took ninety-seven times to get it right . And you know what ? Right feels like dying . " The carousel slowed . I lost her touch . Riders scrambled on and off , bodies and motion between us . I stumbled to the ground , calling for her . " Tori ! ... " The crowd swallowed my voice , as it had my last sight of her . Say this for madness . When madness is all around you , then madness is what you 've got . You go with madness . I accepted my new world of lighted towers , fairy-tale minarets rimmed with stars , Arabian spires circled with lights . I threw myself into a foreign crowd of women who dressed like Tori in long skirts , and some who bound themselves into breathless S-shapes , their waists cinched to nothing ; boys in shorts , girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiff collars , bow ties , suspenders , vests , watch chains , canes . My clothes were something like that . They were like wearing my brother 's clothes that I 'd never have bought for myself , familiar and wrong all at once . But I seemed to fit with the crowd . I pushed through knots of laughing strangers , searching for Tori . Someone slapped me on the back , as if I were part of a joke . I called her name , and another voice blended with mine . We sang rounds . " Tori ! " " Lemonade ! Peanuts ! " My throat caught . Sweat streamed my face . No one else seemed to feel as hot as I did . I brought concern to other faces ; I may have looked sick . The air was n't helping . The salt smell had n't changed , but it mingled with human and livestock scents that assaulted me , like a circus locker room . I wandered beneath acrobats , past tumblers and jugglers . Camels and elephants thumped by . Bands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " THE STREETS OF FIRE ! " " TRIP TO THE MOON ! " " THE LAUGHING SHOW ! " " FIRE AND FLAMES ! " " WHIRL THE WHIRL ! " " INFANT INCUBATORS ! " " LUNA PARK 'S WORLD-FAMOUS SHOOT THE CHUTES ! " The crowd pulled me to watch the wrestlers , the bareback riders . Then , like crows , we were off all at once , rushing to the next attraction , gaining heads and legs along the way . We jammed , we stalled , we hurried on . I strained to hear those voices around me that seemed to understand the excitement . " ... were going to hang her , you know . " " Hang ? They could n't . Would take a chain ...... ... this , instead ...... .... thunder and flash , do you think , when they give it to her ? " I pulled a man 's sleeve to engage him . " I do n't like it , sir , and I wo n't watch it , " he said . His jaw set , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lost . We poured into an arena that smelled of dirt and animals , stronger than ever . We overflowed the tiers of seats , molding ourselves into a human wall around the open space . " It 's time , they 're coming ..... " ... murdering elephant , three men she 's killed . " " They 'll make a pretty light of her . " Across the arena , a gray shape lumbered into recognition . The elephant walked passively toward the center , led by two men : one in a red uniform with gold trim and a high cap ; the other , a shorter man in a brown tweed suit and derby . The elephant 's massive head came up as if she suddenly had broken the concentration of a deep thought . Her legs froze . The man in the red uniform said something to her . I sensed it was not a command , but a comfort . His smile belonged in a hospital . He gently touched . He stroked the huge elephant 's leathery trunk . The crowd hushed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Topsy girl ... , " he said , but she backed away with a start that brought people to their feet , as if to run . " I ca n't do this to her , Mr. Dundy , " the man said to his tweed-suited companion . " I wo n't let her be - " " You w-will if you work for m-me , " Mr. Dundy ordered , his stammer like nicks in the blade of his voice . " No , sir , I wo n't . " The man in the red uniform stood a moment , as if he might defiantly sweep the elephant into his arms like a baby and run with her . What he did , finally , was walk away . In the crowd , some jeered at him . Mr. Dundy wiped his face with a sharply pressed white handkerchief that he stuffed back into his lapel pocket . He motioned , and a crew of other men took the elephant keeper 's place . No shiny red suits masked their business . They had sticks with nails and hooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center of the arena , all the while keeping their distance from her , wounding her in the nip-and-run way of small predators . They roped her to wooden stakes . And now , yet other men set to work on her , much to the crowd 's approval . " ... Thomas Edison 's own .... " " ... in from New Jersey .... ... wires , see what they 're doing , they 're making what they call connections .... " Thomas Edison 's men attached heavy copper wires and electrodes to chains around the elephant 's right front and left rear feet , and scrambled away from her . And now , all eyes were back to Mr. Dundy . He had taken his place barely apart from the crowd , just far enough into the arena to stand out , but safely away from the elephant . Two women stood next to him tightly , possessively . He had the swagger of a rock star . His left arm wrapped a brunette with pouty , apple-red lips . His right arm " Tori ! " Her name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I fought the wall of backs and shoulders that kept me away from her , edging , squeezing , forcing my way into the arena . Rough hands shoved me forward . I fell through a gap in the wall , landing sideways . Something snapped in my side ; I felt a tiny , sudden loss of breath , and feared I 'd broken a rib . But I gathered my feet beneath me in practically the same motion . Thinking better , I would have run the circumference of the arena until it led me to Tori . I was n't thinking that way . I headed straight across the opening , becoming part of the show . Band music struck up as if to accompany my act . All around the cobbler 's bench , The monkey chased the weasel In the center , I stopped , helpless . The elephant 's gaze held me . I could have touched her . I did . From a distance , she looked weathered and hard as stone . But her skin was warm , and my hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Topsy .... " Her massive front legs bent with a clatter of chains . She knelt as if to offer me a ride . Her eyes held vast secrets . The crowd cheered . Mr. Dundy laughed his approval . He strode out to meet me , both women in tow . " First thing we t-tried on her , we soaked her carrots in c-cyanide , " he said . " She never f-felt a thing . Why , I 'd just about decided she had no f-feelings at all . But y-you have a way with her . " He wanted to shake hands , but I stood there , numb , arms to my sides , looking at Tori . She give me not the slightest sign of recognition . He saw my obsession . " Lillian , " he addressed her , " do you k-know this man ? " She looked me up and down , but not like when I 'd offered to buy her Crimson Cosmos . No play , no surprises . Her expression dismissed me . " Tori , what 's wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are ! " she said , peeling my fingers off her as if they were leeches . Her mouth pulled down to an expression she 'd never worn before . " You 're as wrong as I ever seen . " Mr. Dundy reclaimed her , and as he did , a dozen other men materialized from out of the crowd - dirtied workmen , some of them , and big men with clean , pressed suits and clenched hands . " I 'm a friend of hers , " I said , as if somebody had to believe me . " A f-friend , are you ? " he said . " Well , here , f-friend . Take this , and g-get yourself lost . " He flipped something high into the air , where it caught the light , spinning , flashing gold . I caught it with a cold slap into my palm : a gold coin . " Take .. this ! " Mr. Dundy cried in sudden recovery of his laughing mood . He hands emerged from his pants pockets with clutches of gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he let go . He made himself a fountain , spraying gold . People oooh'ed , and cheered , and feet left the ground , and hands reached high . Bodies collided . Fistfights erupted . Screams . People fell to hands and knees , scrabbling after coins on the ground . Then , laughter wove and threaded through the riot , somehow congealing into a chant , until it seemed that everyone took it up in one voice . The two women played cheerleader . The earth may quake And banks may break But Skip Dundy Pays in gold ! Whoops and laughter echoed off the bedazzled towers , until the noise startled Topsy . The elephant roused to her feet . She backed as if to turn and run , straining the ropes that tethered her legs to the ground . One of the heaviest stakes inched free . Mr. Dundy and his women retreated . His derby jarred loose . His hairpiece slipped . He pulled the big handkerchief from his pocket again , waving it high over his head . The band broke out a drum roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bad Topsy ! " " Bad Topsy ! " Topsy lifted her enormous head to trumpet her rage and defiance . I ran from her , too . Mr. Dundy whipped the handkerchief down . The park 's lights dimmed and flickered . Billows of white smoke exploded from the elephant 's feet . She stiffened in a series of shivers and twitches that tickled most of the crowd . Topsy seemed to imagine her death was only a funny feeling she could shake off . Near me , a woman fainted . Someone cursed ; someone cried . In the end , it was like seeing a grand old building implode : that same confusion of wonder and terror , a thrill in the destruction of something huge and irreplaceable . Topsy was dead on her feet , smoke coiling around her . Then , she seemed to lift . Absurdly , I thought of robot jets firing under her feet , blasting her high into the sheltering night . She never reached the stars , though . She fell to her right side , her legs locked straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt the impact through my feet , and in the pit of my stomach like the sound of a cannon , and in my heart . The elephant 's liquid brown eyes rolled up . The current still surged through her . Her feet charred . " C-cut the electricity ! " Mr. Dundy ordered , but too late . Power hummed through the air . Blue fire crackled and arced around the fallen elephant . It snaked into the crowd . People fell back as if toppled by armies of invisible demons swinging sledge hammers . The fire enveloped Tori . A tendril of blue lightning snaked from Tori 's eyes , connecting with mine , and I knew . I understood . I shared with her the jungle heat , the rain , the serenity , the sense of time as something soft and slow , like the rain . And Luna Park went black . - 10 I have to tell you . This is n't the place , but you need to know . If I were editing this manuscript , I would mark an " X @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intrusion , " meaning the author has barged in like a gatecrasher , spoiling the story . But this ca n't wait . You 'll know why . There are mermaids in the electric ocean of time . If you glance up from your reading right now , you might see one . She could be that close . Something in her smile , something in her eyes , makes you trust her . The deeper she takes you , the more you feel safe with her . When you trust her completely , you 're already into the drowning depths . But that 's not what she wants , and that 's not why she drowned all those others before you . How many ? Pick a number , any number , say - ninety-six . She cared all she could for them , and a mermaid 's slightest care is more than a king 's richest dream . But she did n't care enough to save them with her mermaid magic . They were all wooden nickels . You , though , you 're the one . Maybe not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one great thing going for you : You 're the one she 's tried so hard to find . She drowned ninety-six , and then you came along . Or she would have drowned 960 , until you came along ; or 960 million , looking for you . Numbers mean nothing to her . But you do . - 11 Luna Park fell to darkness as completely as , moments before , it had been incredibly illuminated . The cries were like those of primitives in the grip of a solar eclipse . Dizziness took me , but I knew it would be fatal to fall . I would be under panicked feet . Hands clutched at me , feeling for someone familiar , for husband or mother , and shoving the stranger away . I caught a glint of silver light , of moonglow reflected from something familiar , the silver rim of Tori 's hollow pendant - waiting for its remembrance of Topsy . " Brad ... " Her breath cooled my face . " Brad , silly . " She held me . " I have something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger to the corner of her eye . She lifted a tear that she touched to my lips , and followed the taste with a kiss , and the blue fire poured into me . And the jungle , and the rain , and the river , and the ocean . A fly in the water stirs ripples , tiny waves ; and the elephant rides . Something shifted . The ground slid beneath me . " I do n't have the words - " Tori said . " You do n't need any . " The elephant 's brain is twice the size of a person 's . Noone knows how much of the universe fits in an elephant 's mind , or what becomes of the universe when the elephant dies . But I learned enough when the current ran through me . I learned mermaids do n't wander . They orbit . They swim in elliptical orbits that take them farther and farther away from where they started from where they belong . They always return , though . They have to . But once upon a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ocean - so far , she could n't get back . She drifted , lost . She hid among people so well , no one knew she was a mermaid . But she began to have bad effects on them . She belonged in the past , and the past infected her . She made other people long for the past , too . They cherished old pieces of times that never belonged to them , when they should have been thinking of now and tomorrow . She needed something more than her mermaid magic to get back , and it took her ninety-seven times to find it - to find me . " Ride the waves , Brad , " she said . I kissed her for all I was worth . I do n't know when Luna 's lights came back . But I know this : When people ran home that night to say what wonders they had seen at Luna Park , it would n't be the lights , or the Shoot the Chutes , or that poor , dead Topsy creature they told about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's electrical power took hold again , Tori changed . She stood away from me . She had Lillian 's mean mouth for a moment , but she smiled then , still my Tori . I seemed to be climbing , higher and higher into a blue rain , away from her . Racheta-rakkata . She faded , a white figure lost in the light . What am I , Tori ? Ninety-six , and then me , and we all loved you , Tori , and so what ? Did I love you the most ? The least ? The fastest ? The blindest ? What made me any different ? I never heard the answer , but I read it . Her last gift to a reader . Her face blurred as I left her . Her image doubled , tripled , as if I were seeing her through rippled glass . I read the answer from her lips . <p> - 12 One night , the old Pen and Pitcher Club voted the worst cliche in science fiction . The rose in his hand swept the field . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he wakes up with a rose in his hand . The Cyclone ground to a stop . I got off alone . Nobody cared . I shambled through the amusement park , side aching , vaguely aware of something digging at my hand . And then , I remembered : Skip 's gold coin . And then , I remembered : Tori 's wooden nickel . I 'd come again , always again , to the Skee-Ball emporium . The attendant who 'd fought me had taken his place again on the stool . His head slumped to his chest , and he looked almost the same as before , just as dead . The only difference was the bandage under his Yankees cap . Closer , I saw it was n't a hospital bandage around his head . It was a rag that he might have tied himself . The spot where I 'd hit him was mottled the rust color of dried blood , and the rag was greasy from whatever ointment he 'd smeared on . If he breathed , I could n't see it . People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I rolled the object in my hand . Wood is warm , metal is cold . But everything felt cold that night . Without looking , I slid the coin onto the glass prize counter beside him , and I walked away . . What 's a Skee-Ball worth , anyway ? The city no longer frightened me for being old . One day , I finished the books I 'd been afraid to read . Topsy was a bad elephant , but she had her reasons . The last man she killed had fed her a lighted cigarette . Skip died of pneumonia by some accounts , but others say it was a hat pin stabbed through his heart by a jilted lover . Nostalgia is n't selling anymore . People want brand new . New books , new politics , new streets , new meanings , new medicines , new lives . New Coney Island . But Tori was right about me changing jobs . The last book I candied and cudgeled through publication here made it to the New York Times list . The publisher said he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely known in the Pen and Pitcher Club . There ! - I felt the tug , that little slide again , that tells me I do n't have to stay here . I have just enough of Tori 's mermaid magic in me to go out in the ocean and swim to .. I do n't know where . But what if I could n't get back ? What if I had to love someone new in order to get back ? I see her a million times a day , in sunlight on blonde hair , in a certain smile , in every white dress , in everything silver . Sleeping , I search for my Tori through Luna , and Steeplechase , and Dreamland , for which the lovely waltz was written . Meet me in Dreamland , sweet dreamy Dreamland .
