How 's this for a nightmare ? You are passed over for a promotion . You go ballistic and start typing an e-mail to a co-worker , ranting about your boss and how you 're thinking about suing the company for discrimination . Then your rational side kicks in . You realize that maybe you were n't the best candidate and delete the message . End of story ? Not quite . It turns out that every character you typed , errors and all , has been stored for the boss to see . You get a call from the corner office . Mr. Bullmoose would like to see you . <P> Something right out of an updated Orwell , circa 2084 . Except there 's no need to wait that long : it 's going on today . In offices around the U.S. , managers are installing software that monitors their employees ' computer activity , both online and off-line  --  every message sent , every website visited , every file formatted and , perhaps most Orwellian of all , every key stroked , even if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it 's all happening . <P> About 17% of FORTUNE 1,000 companies , along with half a dozen federal agencies , now have so-called monitoring software , according to International Data Corp. , a research firm in Framingham , Mass . The figure is expected to jump to 80% by 2001 . And about 12% of companies in an American Management Association survey said they do not notify their employees of their monitoring activities . <P> Increasingly , corporations are using sanctions against violators of their rules on computer use . Twenty-eight percent of companies in the A.M.A. survey said they have dismissed employees for misuse or personal use of telecommunications equipment . Last year Xerox fired 40 employees for what it deemed inappropriate use of the Internet , and the New York Times axed 23 workers for sending what were considered to be obscene e-mails on company computers . " We are on the verge of creating a surveillance society in the workplace , " says American Civil Liberties Union associate director Barry Steinhardt . Monitoring advocates reply that the threat of intellectual-property theft , lawsuits and just plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of  --  spying . <P> At the moment , monitoring for most companies means tracking e-mail and Net use . Elron Software of Burlington , Mass. , makes Message Inspector , a program that sniffs out inappropriate terms  --  as defined by whoever owns it  --  from incoming and outgoing e-mails . When it finds one , the program obliterates the e-mail or records it in a company database . San Diego firm Websense offers Websense Enterprise , a Trekkie name for a program that blocks access to inappropriate Web pages and logs every minute employees spend on each site . <P> The surreptitious off-line capabilities of snooping programs are creating a booming industry . Off-line surveillance means someone spying on anything you do while not connected to the Net . That includes simple word processing like constructing drafts or writing in a diary . The most far-reaching programs keep a log of every letter you type and delete . " Scanning for key words and websites is not rocket science , " says Jonathan Penn , analyst at Giga Information Group , an e-business advisory firm in Cambridge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon going to approach a billion-dollar market .
