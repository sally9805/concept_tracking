<p> ' Take a look at that alley  --  it 's spotless . " Alleys are the touchstone of Chicago politicians ; and the one Neil Hartigan has just pointed out to me , in Rogers Park , is clean as a whistle . <p> Hartigan was baptized at St. Ignatius Parish ( a k a the Patch ) in 1938 , and he 's still here . If you do n't know who he is , you do n't know who anybody is . His father , David , was the 49th Ward alderman , and Neil served as precinct captain , ward committeeman , deputy mayor , lieutenant governor , attorney general , appellate court justice and Democratic Party candidate for governor . The Hartigan family has been the backbone of this Chicago neighborhood forever . <p> He picked me up in his Caddy and wove stories of the chieftains of his ward , his family and his city while we toured the Patch . For a Chicago political junkie , this was primo : hanging with a Celtic shaman who battled the dragons . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He gave his first speech representing his bedridden father at the dedication of the streetlights in the ward . " I was 16 . Oh , my God , you wan na talk about scared ? " <p> Tom Keane , Parky Cullerton and a bunch of aldermen smoked cigars while playing high-stakes gin rummy in 27th Ward Ald. Harry Sain 's office in City Hall . The teenager acting as a lookout at the door was young Neil Hartigan . <p> His mom was a Hogan from Holy Family Parish on the West Side , and his dad was the youngest of 14 kids from 29th and Wallace . His mom 's brother Frank " Tweet " Hogan lived next door to them on Albion with his wife and family . The Hartigans and Hogans grew up together as an extended family . Neil was the second of five kids . His little sister Eileen drowned in a pool at 12 . " She was an angel . It killed my dad , actually . It was just a terribly tragic thing .

" The bells of the Angelus broke up their basketball games . " You had to have your butt in those chairs for dinner at 6 o'clock . " <p> He learned about loyalty from his father . " He came out of Loyola Law School at the end of the Depression . The fella that gave him a chance came from the Polish community , Paul Drymalski .

He stood up , shook hands , walks back next door to the deputy 's office and sat down , and there ya are . Would you like to try to find that today ? Five years ! But then it was , ' If your word 's no good , you 're no good , ' and they both were very honorable guys . " <p> Neil tells me about the war in 1955 , when Richard J. Daley challenged Mayor Martin Kennelly . " That was the fight that really defined the city and the party for the next 20 years . " His dad ran for 49th Ward alderman and won , but illness plagued him . Unbeknownst to his colleagues , he was going blind . Neil 's brother David put off going into the seminary to work at city hall . He became his father 's eyes .

During a campaign meeting a local political leader worked Neil 's dad over about his health . That night his dad called the pol to his home . Neil was home from Georgetown for Easter , and he and his brother hid on the staircase landing and eavesdropped on the meeting . <p> " My dad says , ' Listen you so and so , do n't ever do that to me again . Do n't ever embarrass me in public or embarrass my family in public . I beat you before , and as long as you ever want to run for anything , I 'll run against you and I 'll kick your  --  .

Last June he lost his wife , Marge , to cancer , and he just resigned from the bench to spend more time with his daughter Bridget , who 's having some health problems of her own . <p> " I think it 's just common sense . We 've been talking about this neighborhood , and everything about it is family and kids and what our parents did for us . " <p> In his basement he shows me pictures of himself and Marge with the most significant leaders of the 20th century , from Tip O'Neill to Ariel Sharon . He laughs and cracks open a beer .
