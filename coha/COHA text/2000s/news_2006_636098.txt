<p> Using a baseball as a weapon is dangerous . Watching Ozzie Guillen order a kid pitcher to retaliate with a weapon is frightening . And when that kid pitcher fails to be a goon-on-demand , prompting Guillen to rip into a humiliated Sean Tracey , I am left to ponder three disturbing thoughts about the Blizzard of Oz . <p> Has he officially lost his mind ? <p> Are his priorities in sufficient order to manage the White Sox to an encore title ? <p> And is he involved in so many rants and raves and headline-grabbing incidents , about two a week these days , that he 's burning all of us out  --  including his players ? <p> No man who is thinking straight would pull the megalomaniacal b.s. that Guillen did Wednesday night in Texas . There is a time and place for payback , and with the Sox lucky not to have had more players suspended after the Crosstown Smackdown last month , it was senseless and immature of Ozzie to obsess over the fact A.J. Pierzynski  --  there 's that name again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vicente Padilla . Guillen needed to put this episode on the back burner , take an 8-0 loss like an adult , focus on why the Sox have so many inconsistent pitching outings and direct his energies toward convincing general manager Ken Williams that trades are necessary . <p> But when his mind is locked in Blizzard mode , Guillen loses all control . He decided it was more important to settle a score , right then and there , while risking more disciplinary action by an amateurish Major League Baseball judicial system kept busy by Chicago 's two clubs . There is little doubt Guillen , as reported , ordered Tracey to throw at Hank Blalock in retaliation for Pierzynski 's two plunkings . When Tracey went inside twice but did n't draw skin , Guillen 's yanking of the pitcher and subsequent dugout harangue proves he had made a demand that was n't carried out . <p> I 'd like to report that Ozzie gained a little perspective overnight . Incredibly , he was even nuttier Thursday , questioning why Pierzynski did n't charge the mound to fight Padilla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I will fight . I 'd get my butt kicked , but I will fight , " said Guillen , echoing the commentary of Hawk Harrelson during the game broadcast . Asked why he did n't attack the mound , Pierzynski , of all people , was a voice of reason . <p> We 're in a pennant race , " he said . We are going to need everyone down the stretch . " <p> A pennant race ? Who knew ? <p> Forget that Tracey apparently responded with tears and the need to cover his face with his jersey , not the image you want to see from a big-leaguer . My concern is that Guillen 's in-view tantrums and regular rip jobs are beginning to wear thin in his own clubhouse , even after his success last season as a World Series champion skipper . It 's not as though Tracey was ignoring Guillen 's edict ; twice , he clearly backed Blalock off the plate , keeping in mind it is n't easy being a right-handed pitcher trying to plunk a left-handed hitter . Also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think a rookie can wander in and immediately become an expert hit man . Picking on Tracey in full view of the Ballpark at Arlington cameras was a bad moment for Guillen . <p> Ball can be a deadly weapon <p> Players lose respect for a manager who hangs a teammate out to dry . No ? The Sox camp is n't exactly airtight these days . When the Sun-Times and the Sox ' own Web site quoted postgame sources who leaked that Guillen was furious with Tracey for not nailing Blalock  --  Ozzie went nuts . He had the ass , big-time , " one source was quoted as saying  --  it suggests that secrets are being told out of school . Guillen ca n't be happy about it , especially after inventing some jive story about being mad because Agustin Montero was n't ready to pitch in the bullpen . He concocted the tale so he could avoid a suspension from on high . Now , there 's a fair chance the case will be investigated and Guillen could face punishment , all because of the snitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , based on his most recent rant about steroids informant Jason Grimsley and how someone should shoot the bleep " for revealing details and names to federal investigators . <p> Just once , I 'd like to hear Tracey or another pitcher publicly admit he does n't enjoy hitting a batter in retaliation . But most wo n't go there , recalling how Shawn Estes was ridiculed by fans and media in 2002 when he pitched behind Roger Clemens instead of hitting him in a New York showdown . Tracey has yet to comment , though maybe he will after being sent to the minors in a move that was in the works as Williams was acquiring reliever David Riske from Boston . A baseball , in case anyone forgot , is round and hard . In 1920 , a pitch thrown by a mean sinkerballer named Carl Mays hit Ray Chapman in the temple and fractured his skull , causing blood to gush out of his mouth , nose and ears . He died the next morning . The career of Tony Conigliaro , a gifted Boston outfielder , ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have n't had similar horror stories of late , which probably means we 're due for one . <p> Imagine the outrage if a player died or his career ended prematurely because he was victimized by a purpose pitch . Does Ozzie ever think about that ? If Padilla was throwing intentionally at Pierzynski  --  first time , he definitely was ; second time , A.J. did n't get out of the way  --  he and Rangers manager Buck Showalter should have the same battle with their consciences . Same goes for the menacing Randy Johnson , who was suspended five games Thursday for intentionally throwing at Cleveland 's Eduardo Perez . <p> Using a baseball as a weapon is cowardly . The players shrug it off and say , That 's the game , " but many of them are too lunkheaded to know better . <p> No different than other goons <p> What 's the difference between Guillen asking Tracey to be a goon and John Chaney , the former Temple basketball coach , asking a player to be a goon and commit hard fouls ? What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman in 1989 by Eagles coach Buddy Ryan ? Do n't forget , Ozzie has an ongoing feud with Showalter , who questioned Guillen 's knowledge of the rules as a rookie manager and launched a verbal war . <p> Showalter never even smelled a jock in the big leagues , " Guillen said two years ago . Mr. Baseball ' never even got a hit in Triple-A . There are so many different things he might be jealous of ... I was a better player than him , I 've got more money than him and I 'm better-looking than him . " <p> Such is the juvenile rancor that causes grudges to linger and purpose pitches to fly . <p> Baseball seems on the verge of a nervous breakdown . Players are still using human growth hormone , commissioner Bud Selig is taking out newspaper ads telling fans he cares about steroids and Arizona slugger Luis Gonzalez is upset that a top Diamondbacks executive mentioned there have been whispers " about Gonzalez and steroids . Now , we have Guillen prioritizing goonery over common sense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , too . <p> Jay Mariotti is a regular on " Around the Horn " at 4 p.m. on ESPN .
