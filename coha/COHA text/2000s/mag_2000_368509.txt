" That 's what this debate is about  --  the role of government in America , " George Bush told a cheering crowd near Denver . " It 's not just the difference between Big Government and smaller . It 's the difference between a Big Government that thinks it knows best and a smaller government that believes you know better . " <P> The Bush who spoke these words was not the Texas Governor but his father , the President , fighting his losing re-election battle against Bill Clinton in the fall of 1992 . What 's striking is that George W. Bush all but repeated the lines in last week 's presidential debate in Boston . After spending a year trying to convince people that he 's a different kind of Republican , Bush is hammering Al Gore with the same old-fashioned theme that did n't work for his dad . " There is a huge difference in this campaign , " he said Tuesday night . " It 's the difference between big , exploding Federal Government that wants to think on your behalf and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to make decisions on your own . " <P> A thick , befuddling fog settled over the presidential campaign in Boston  --  a blanket of contradictory facts and assertions that has n't lifted yet . But two basic images loom through the haze . The first is Bush 's portrait of Gore as a retrograde liberal who wants to patch up the edifice of the Great Society . The second is Gore 's portrait of Bush as a faithful servant of the rich and powerful who wants to wire-transfer the surplus into the bank accounts of the upper class , spending " more money on tax cuts for the wealthiest 1% " than he does for new education , health-care and defense programs combined . Are Bush and Gore right about each other ? Every campaign serves up a cartoon version of its opponent . But these two caricatures are worth examining , because doing so helps explain how each man would govern , where their records and philosophies are fundamentally different  --  and where their plans are more alike than either cares to admit . <P> Gore 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Bush 's picture of Big Government Al did n't come into focus until Sept. 28 . During a speech in Green Bay , Wis. , Bush charged that Gore " has left the vital center of American politics ... and cast his lot with the old Democratic Party , " betraying the reform-minded moderates that Gore helped propel to power in 1992 . " The Vice President was seated right behind Bill Clinton at the State of the Union when the President declared , ' The era of Big Government is over , ' " Bush said . " Apparently , the message never took ... He offers a big federal-spending program to nearly every single voting bloc in America . He expands entitlements without reforms to sustain them .
