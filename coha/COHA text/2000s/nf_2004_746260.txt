Key words : Jefferson and social studies ; Jeffersonian curricula ; Jefferson and civic education <p> It is virtually impossible to find a U.S. civics or government textbook that does not cite Thomas Jefferson 's faith in a well-educated citizenry as the great defense against tyranny . It is also common to open a U.S. history textbook for middle or high school students and find a reference to Jefferson and the value he put on education . His name is found in the opening paragraphs of the major curricular documents of the National Council for the Social Studies ( 1994 ) and the Center for Civic Education ( 1994 ) . Jefferson 's Bill for the More General Diffusion of Knowledge and his urging George Wythe to " preach , dear sir , a crusade against ignorance " are frequently referenced in those contexts . The letter to George Wythe is dated August 13 , 1786 . Jefferson 's Bill for the More General Diffusion of Knowledge was part of his legislative program for the State of Virginia in 1779 . He originally saw it as part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charter of the College of William and Mary and a bill for the creation of a system of public libraries . Jefferson believed that those measures , taken together , would create a better-educated citizenry in Virginia . He felt that was necessary to ensure the success of republicanism . His faith in the basic ideas of his plan never wavered . <p> Because the social studies as a curricular area is a recent development not formally organized until the twentieth century , Jefferson himself did not make a direct connection between his views on education and what we know as social studies education . Yet , there is a natural tendency to include him in social studies conversations , more so than any other of the founding generation , even those who were also concerned with education in the new republic . In this article , I present documented evidence about his views on citizenship education and answer the question about how Jefferson 's ideas regarding proper schooling serve as a foundation for the subject matter that we now call the social studies . Jefferson and the Curriculum <p> Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypocritical , on a number of issues , his faith in education as a foundation for the survival of the new republic was not one of those . In a letter to Joseph C. Cabell in 1814 , he wrote that " there are two subjects , indeed , which I shall claim a right to further as long as I breathe , the public education , and the sub-division of counties into wards " ( Lipscomb and Bergh 1903 , 14 : 84 ) . That was still true in 1825 near the end of his life . Because of his widely known faith in education , others frequently asked Jefferson for his views on the proper education necessary for the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries . Questions to him focused on topics ranging from the proper education suited for a gentleman to the appropriate education for young women , although the latter group was not " a subject of systematic contemplation " for Jefferson ( Lipscomb and Bergh 1903 , 5 : 185-88 , 15 : 165-67 ) . He advised T. M. Randolph Jr . about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study at William and Mary for his nephew Peter Carr , he expressed his views on recommended works of history and on the teaching methods of Johann Pestalozzi to William Duane , and he described the corrective potential of education for Thomas Law ( Lipscomb and Bergh 1903 , 5:165-69 , 6:256-62 , 7:413-17 , 14:138-44 ) . <p> Jefferson not only embraced the idea of a well-educated citizenry being necessary for the new republic but also believed that certain subjects were important for a person to enjoy life and to be well rounded . Some of his recommendations can be found in his formal plans for public education in Virginia , put forth first in the Bill for the More General Diffusion of Knowledge and later in a revision titled A Bill for Establishing a System of Public Education , written in 1817 . Much can also be found in the many letters he wrote . By using those documents , we can essentially construct Jefferson 's preferred curriculum to prepare a person to be a good citizen . The content areas that Jefferson emphasized would today fall under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed history  --  a major component of today 's social studies curricula  --  was most important in learning what was necessary to function as a citizen . Students should learn " useful facts from Grecian , Roman , European , and American history " ( Jefferson 1787 1982 , 147 ) . Although that may sound problematic to some today , it must be remembered that such knowledge was proof of being an educated person in the eighteenth century . Jefferson 's belief in the value of learning history can be found in many of his public and private documents . In his bill of 1779 , he proposed that all primary schools in Virginia teach " reading , writing , and common arithmetick sic , and the books which shall be used therein for instructing the children to read shall be such as will at the same time make them acquainted with Grecian , Roman , English and American history " ( Lee 1967 , 86 ) . To Jefferson , the primary level of schooling was important because it was at that level that all white children would receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Children would , therefore , learn what they would need to perform their potential civic responsibilities , no matter what their respective futures might hold . One reason why all people should learn history is that it " can be pursued after you shall have left your present situation as well as while you remain in it , " thus facilitating a lifelong learning experience , no matter what one 's social status ( Peterson 1984 , 862 ) . History was , therefore , essential to Jefferson . <p> For this purpose the reading in the first stage , where they will receive their whole education , is proposed ... to be chiefly historical . History by apprising them of the past will enable them to judge the future ; it will avail them of the experience of other times and other nations ; it will qualify them as judges of the actions and designs of men ; it will enable them to know ambition under every disguise it may assume , and knowing it , to defeat its views . ( Jefferson 1787 1982 , 148 ; emphasis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to teach the students reading , writing , and arithmetic would also be familiarizing them with the key elements of history , Jefferson was proposing an interdisciplinary curriculum infused with social studies content . That was also true in a student 's language acquisition . In the following quotation , Jefferson has used the term science to mean knowledge , not merely a particular academic discipline . John Dewey noted that " ' science ' is used by Jefferson , in agreement with the habit of the day , as an equivalent of knowledge . It included what we now call scholarship as well as what we call science " ( 1940 , 8 ) . <p> I do not pretend that language is science . It is only for the attainment of science . But that time is not lost which is employed in providing tools for future operation ; more especially as in this case the books put into the hands of the youth for this purpose may be such as will at the same time impress their minds with useful facts and good principles . ( Jefferson 1787 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced to the second level of Jefferson 's scheme , called grammar schools in 1779 and district colleges in 1817 , continued to receive a program built around those subjects . The curriculum for the boys was to include " the Greek , Latin , French , Spanish , Italian , and Germanic Languages , English grammar , geography , ancient and modern , the higher branches of numerical arithmetic , the mensuration of land , the use of the globes , and the ordinary elements of navigation " ( Honeywell 1931 , 237-38 ) . The two levels of schooling offered all boys a basic educational foundation in history , geography , and , we might infer , elements of what today falls under the disciplines of anthropology , sociology , and political science . <p> In both plans , girls were excluded from the higher levels of education . Jefferson too distinguished between education for " the laboring and the learned . " Although their educational tracks would lead toward different ends , he believed that each required the same educational foundation . According to his plan of 1817 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leadership classes , but again , each needed more instruction in what today we would label the social sciences or social studies ( see Jefferson 's letter to Peter Carr dated September 7 , 1814 , in Lipscomb and Bergh 1903 , 19 : 213-15 ) . <p> In a 1787 letter to his nephew , Peter Carr , Jefferson advised him about how to approach his studies with George Wythe at the College of William and Mary . Jefferson included an " enclosure , " which contained " a sketch of the sciences to which I would wish you to apply in such order as Mr. Wythe shall advise . " He also described " the books in them worth your reading , " in essence , his suggested reading list . Included on the list were works of history , natural philosophy , agriculture , politics , and law . The authors included Herodotus , Livy , Gibbons , Tacitus , Hume , Franklin , Locke , Burke , and Middleton ( Lee 1967 , 149-50 ) . Certainly , history , political science , and geography are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those disciplines in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , we can assume that students were also exposed to economics and what today is basic anthropology . Thus , we can conclude that within the framework of a classical education in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries , Jefferson saw the elements of the social studies as not only valuable but also necessary . <p> At the peak of Jefferson 's educational pyramid were those students advancing to the college level . According to his plan of 1779 , one outstanding student from among the grammar school seniors would be chosen for a three-year state scholarship at the College of William and Mary . In his plan of 1817 , Jefferson was no longer content with the College of William and Mary , and he sought instead to create a new capstone institution , what is today the University of Virginia . Those attending would constitute " the learned class " of Virginians and would pursue two distinct options : Those who are destined for learned professions , as a means of livelihood ; and The wealthy , who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the affairs of the nation , or to live with usefulness and respect in the private ranks of life ( Lipscomb and Bergh 1903 , 19 : 214 ) . <p> Although there is an elitist element to that part of Jefferson 's thinking , what is important for our understanding is the extensive curriculum he prescribed for the students . Whereas their ambitions and destinies might be different , Jefferson believed that " both of these sections will require instruction in all the higher branches of science , " thereby necessitating a common curriculum . That common curriculum should include the following : <p> history and geography , ancient and modern ; natural philosophy , agriculture , chemistry , and the theories of medicine ; anatomy ... zoology , botany , mineralogy and geology ; mathematics , pure and mixed ; military and naval science ; ideology , ethics , the law of nature and of nations ; law , municipal and foreign ; the science of civil government and political economy ; languages , belle lettres , and the fine arts generally . ( Honeywell 1931 , 241 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , effective citizenship education . At each level of both his legislative proposals , Jefferson wanted students to receive the education that would " promote in every order of men the degree of instruction proportioned to their condition , and to their views in life " ( Lipscomb and Bergh 1903 , 15 : 292-93 ) . In each case , there is a clear emphasis on subject matter that today is considered the social studies . Thus equipped , all citizens , regardless of educational background , would be effective defenders of the new republic against threats to their personal liberty . In addition , the appropriate education would make " them examples of virtue to others , and of happiness within themselves " ( Lee 1967 , 118 ) . Jefferson 's Teaching Methods <p> Because Jefferson was not an educator , it requires considerable extrapolation to outline his ideas regarding issues about methods of teaching . Honeywell noted that for someone as thorough and meticulous as Jefferson , " he has left surprisingly few opinions about principles and methods of teaching " ( Honeywell 1931 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about pedagogical concerns , he did leave a few clues that suggest a reasonable hypothesis about his teaching methods . <p> Although Jefferson acknowledged such traditional teaching techniques as lectures , he also praised his mentor , George Wythe of the College of William and Mary , in 1788 for his " moot courts and parliaments wherein he presides and the young men debate regularly in law , and legislation , learn the rules of parliamentary proceedings , and acquire the habit of public speaking " ( Boyd 1956 , 13 : 372 ) . That evidence suggests that he saw value in participatory teaching strategies in which students construct and then reconstruct their learning through their experience . Such techniques also reinforce communication skills and critical thinking , both essential for good republican citizens . <p> In an 1810 letter to Colonel William Duane , Jefferson referred favorably to the methods of Swiss educational reformer Johann Pestalozzi . Pestalozzi believed in " bringing into coherence all the means of education which must affect the child as a whole " ( Silber 1965 , 181 ) . Jefferson had " received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publications " and , believing those using that method had " both the talents and zeal " for carrying it into effect , he " sincerely " hoped it would be successful ( Lipscomb and Bergh 1903 , 12 : 416-17 ) . Pestalozzi favored a more humane , child-centered approach : " By grouping facts and experiences together in the right way , by arranging them in the right order , it should be possible to establish a natural progression from the most simple to the most difficult without there being any gaps " ( Heafford 1967 , 45 ) . That rational approach to learning probably sat very well with Jefferson . <p> Furthermore , it would complement a developmental attitude toward learning that Jefferson hinted at in a letter to Ralph Izard in 1788 . In reference to Izard 's second son and his educational progress , Jefferson wrote that he had " never thought that a boy should undertake abstruse and difficult sciences such as mathematics in general till 15 years of age at soonest . Before that time they are best employed in learning languages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1956 , 13 : 372-73 ) . I deduce from that that Jefferson saw learning as taking place in differentiated stages and that certain curricula were not suited to a student 's ability until they were age appropriate . <p> The bottom line for Jefferson was to employ teaching methods that produced results . In 1786 , he advised Thomas Mann Randolph Jr . of the value of reading and the need for reflection on one 's studies ( Lee 1967 , 141 ) . Although no fan of " contemporary educational fads and short-cuts to knowledge , " Jefferson was , through experience , convinced of the need for " intense study aided by intelligent explanation , " especially at the higher levels ( Honeywell 1931 , 112 ) . From that , one can infer that Jefferson saw the teacher as a facilitator of the child 's learning . One thing is certain : He favored improved teaching methods that would be effective in producing one of the key purposes of schooling  --  an educated and informed citizenry . Citizenship Education <p> It is with regard to citizenship education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies . Public education was necessary not only as a means to make the republican machinery work but also to be a line of defense for liberty against encroachment by potentially overzealous governments . Jefferson 's educational philosophy has been labeled as utilitarian , empirical , and experiential ( Lee 1967 ; Malone 1981 ; Howe 1986 ) . His support of educational methods that produced effective and participatory citizens as the litmus test suggests that his pedagogy was practical or utilitarian . That can be seen in his interest in the work of Pestalozzi . For Pestalozzi , " the test of any educational theory lay in its practical applications " ( Heafford 1967 , 41 ) . A successful education enables a student " to see himself as a moral being and use his attainments for higher purposes " ( Silber 1965 , 182 ) . That resonated with Jefferson , who believed that republican governments required virtuous citizens , " the essence " of which , he wrote to John Adams in 1816 , " is doing good to others " ( Lipscomb and Bergh 1903 , 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Law , Jefferson described education as one of the " correctives " for those who were morally deficient ( Lipscomb and Bergh 1903 , 14 : 142-43 ) . Pestalozzi 's ideas therefore reinforced Jefferson 's belief in the practical purpose education served . For Jefferson , the finished product  --  the student venturing into the real world-was the ultimate goal of education . The practical application for republican citizens was their ability to function in the body politic . <p> Pestalozzi believed that education was necessary for all children regardless of status , although adaptations were necessary . Silber describes the differentiated curriculum as follows : <p> The basic pattern of the domestic situation is , he says , the same for all men . But , he continues , the use of it must vary according to the social station and the particular circumstances of the individual or the group . Practical education of " the rich " must be different from that of the poor , vocational training of the town child different from that of the country child , of the agricultural worker from that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement with man 's actual condition . ( 1965,189 ) <p> For Pestalozzi , educating all has both an individual and a community benefit . Improved earning power will positively affect the standard of living for all . Consequently , " the individual will be able to fulfill his responsibilities as a citizen and thus further the welfare of his community and his country " ( Silber 1965 , 189-90 ) . That squares well with Jefferson 's plan to educate all citizens , at least all white citizens , at an elementary level . In his 1814 letter to Peter Carr , Jefferson wrote his belief that " it is the duty of our country 's functionaries , to provide that every citizen in it should receive an education proportioned to the condition and pursuits of his life . " Furthermore , Jefferson expected every citizen to be able " to understand his duties to his neighbors and country , and to discharge with competence the functions confided to him by either " ( Lipscomb and Bergh 1903 , 19 : 213 ) . Therefore , we can assume that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the education of future citizens so that they could " observe with intelligence and faithfulness all the social relations under which he shall be placed " ( Lee 1967 , 117 ) . That most valuable end could be served by multiple strategies to meet the needs of individual learners . Finding Jefferson in the Social Studies <p> To determine the extent to which Jefferson 's ideas about education support the current social studies curriculum , a set of criteria is needed . The curricular tensions that exist in the social studies are well documented ( Barr , Barth , and Shermis 1977 ; Marker and Mehlinger 1992 ; Vinson 1998 ; Ross 2001 ; Evans 2004 ) . National standards published in the past decade reflect the interests of history education ( National Center for History in the Schools 1996 ) , geographic education ( National Geographic Society 1994 ) , economic education ( National Council on Economic Education 1997 ) , and citizenship education ( Center for Civic Education 1994 ) . Since the term social studies was first used in the early twentieth century , it has had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Singer argues that given the complexity of global living and of the educational needs of a democratic society , " the social studies are multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary " ( 2003 , 18 ) . <p> The National Council for the Social Studies ( NCSS ) published a description of " ten thematic strands that form the basis of the social studies standards " ( 1994 , 19-30 ) . The strands reflect the integration of the individual disciplines that make up the social studies and include the interaction between the academic areas of history , political science and civics , geography , economics , sociology , anthropology , and psychology . College methods texts consider the NCSS and its strands to be representative of the national standards for teaching social studies ( Martorella 2001 ; Singer 2003 ) . Therefore , I use the ten NCSS strands to evaluate the connections between Jefferson 's ideas about education and today 's social studies curriculum . The Ten Strands and Jefferson 's Views on Education <p> The first strand is Culture . " Social studies programs should include experiences that provide for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 21 ) . Jefferson wrote of the burial practices of some of the Native American peoples in Virginia and of some of the presumed customs associated with their funeral rituals . For example , he described " the custom , said to prevail among the Indians , of collecting , at certain periods , the bones of all their dead , wheresoever deposited at the time of their death " ( Jefferson 1787 1982 , 97 ) . Some of those findings were the result of an archaeological dig that Jefferson himself did at a site in his " neighborhood " ( 98-100 ) . He also speculated on " from whence came those aboriginal inhabitants of America " ( 100 ) . Jefferson had a great fascination with the languages of the native peoples and wondered whether they had " a system of enumeration . " That kind of information is needed " to construct the best evidence of the derivation of the human race " ( 101-02 ) . His interest in the languages of Native Americans was " worthy of further inquiry " ( 107 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Charlottesville in American Indian Languages and History ( Wallace 1999 , 329-34 ) . The " reward " for studying native languages " must be the addition made to the philosophy of language " ( Lipscomb and Bergh 1903 , 16 : 107 ) . Jefferson also concerned himself with describing the physical characteristics of the African American slaves and how they were distinguished from the white population in terms of intellect , artistic talents , and musical abilities ( 1787 1982 , 138-40 ) . Although rudimentary by today 's standards , such intellectual inquiries would fall under the heading of the study of culture . <p> That also suggests a crude attempt to deal with the issue of cultural diversity . In his Notes on the State of Virginia , he addresses some of the concerns and prospects for the " inhabitants of every age , sex , and condition " ( 1787 1982 , 87 ) . In addition to his remarks about Native Americans and African American slaves , Jefferson discusses the relative advantages and disadvantages of increasing numbers of immigrants entering Virginia . He believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society , which they would embrace and , " with their own language , " would " transmit to their children " ( 85 ) . He also saw reason for concern regarding their impact on the politics of the state : " They will infuse into it the legislation their spirit , warp and bias its direction , and render it a heterogeneous , incoherent , distracted mass " ( 85 ) . <p> His racist views prevented him from seeing any possibility of the white and black population being able to coexist . " The ingrained prejudices of whites and the memories of abuse and inflicted pain among blacks could only produce convulsions which will probably never end but in the extermination of the one or the other race " ( 1787 1982 , 138 ) . His outlook for Native Americans was more optimistic . Grinde ( 1999 ) argues that for Jefferson , " the study of the origins of American Indians was more than an academic pursuit " ( 198 ) . Intermarriage and cultural blending would be advantageous . In fact , it was desirous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , to intermix , and become one people . Incorporating themselves with us as citizens of the U.S. , this is what the natural progress of things will of course bring on , and it will be better to promote than to retard it . ( Peterson 1984 , 1115 ; see also Grinde 1999 , 198-99 ) <p> Although one can not accuse Jefferson of embracing the idea of cultural diversity , it is accurate to say that he did grapple with the meaning and consequences of its existence in the United States . <p> The next two thematic strands  --  Time , Continuity , and Change and People , Places , and Environments  --  correlate with Jefferson 's emphasis on history and geography and therefore need no elaboration . <p> The fourth strand is Individual Development and Identity . Although Jefferson saw education as a force for self-improvement and as a lifelong endeavor , he did not specifically address to any great extent the psychological aspects suggested by this theme . He did address issues such as self-fulfillment as a byproduct of learning , but he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal of education . <p> The fifth thematic strand is Individuals , Groups , and Institutions . Jefferson did think students should learn about political history , and this included institutions of British government as well as those of the United States . His ward system was based on the premise that citizens needed to be involved directly in the government closest to them and that " these little republics would be the main strength of the great one " ( Lipscomb and Bergh 1903 , 12 : 393 ) . Jefferson further believed that a basic responsibility of a citizen was " to understand his duties to his neighbors and country , and to discharge with competence the functions confided to him by either . " Indeed , a good citizen would " observe with intelligence and faithfulness all the social relations under which he shall be placed " ( Lee 1967 , 117 ) . In his Notes on the State of Virginia ( 1787 1982 ) , Jefferson addressed his ideas for public education ( 146-49 ) , the College of William and Mary ( 150-51 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those citations that " social relations " included a person 's responsibilities to family , work , and community . Furthermore , Jefferson was well known for his criticism of organized Christianity for having " perverted " the teachings of Jesus ( Peterson 1984 , 1085-86 ) . By using the tools of " reason and freedom of thought , " he hoped that Americans could discover for themselves that " the artificial scaffolding " of organized churches was unnecessary to understand the " genuine doctrines of this the most venerated reformer of human errors " ( Peterson 1984 , 1468-69 ) . Therefore , I maintain that it is safe to assume that Jefferson believed that " the study of interactions among individuals , groups , and institutions " was a worthy task . <p> Jefferson addresses the sixth strand , Power , Authority , and Governance , in his educational plans . He believed that the main purpose of an educated citizenry is to serve as the basic line of defense against any encroachment on their lives by a government . Jefferson considered it important for students to understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the rights of man , in nature and in society " and how " the distinctive principles of government " could serve to protect them . Toward those ends , he thought it important to read such political works as the Declaration of Independence , the Federalist Papers , and the Constitution of the United States , in addition to the resolutions of the General Assembly of Virginia in 1799 and the valedictory address of President Washington . Furthermore , he encouraged students to read the works of Locke and Sidney because he believed that they would help promote an understanding of the relationship between government and the protection of liberty ( Peterson 1984 , 479 ) . Given the role he played in the independence movement and in the early history of the new government , it is not surprising that Jefferson felt it important for students to understand their relationship to and the workings of government . <p> NCSS identified Production , Distribution , and Consumption as the next thematic strand . Jefferson believed that not only did a citizen need " the information ... for the transaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be part of a student 's education ( Lee 1967 , 117 , 121 ) . Jefferson believed that a student 's need to study economics was based on the level of education the student would achieve . In other words , students finishing only the primary level of schooling needed only a level of economics sufficient to maintain personal economic well-being . Students entering the third level needed a deeper understanding of economics . <p> The eighth strand is Science , Technology , and Society . As an inventor , Jefferson was obviously interested in new technologies . In his letters , he hinted at an interest in the impact of the changes brought by technology on social issues . However , I found no direct reference to Jefferson 's favoring specific instruction in that area , although he did advocate instruction in Technical Philosophy for the third tier of his scheme . He favored a rigorous understanding of science in the narrow sense , especially in the second and third levels of his plan . Students at those levels were to study " Physics , Chemistry , Anatomy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursue courses in " Practice of Medicine ; Materia Medica , and Pharmacy ; and Surgery " ( Lipscomb and Bergh 1903 , 19 : 219 ) . <p> Little in Jefferson 's educational plans related to the NCSS theme of Global Connections . Except for what students were to learn about other governments in their history and civics classes and the influences of different climates on regional and national development and what they were to learn in geography , most would learn little about what we could call global awareness . At the second and third levels of learning , students were to take courses in " Law of Nature and Nations " and " Law , Municipal and Foreign " ( Lipscomb and Bergh 1903 , 19 : 219 ) . Students learned about the great philosophers of the time , but global awareness received little attention in Jefferson 's curriculum . <p> The last thematic strand identified by the NCSS is Civic Ideals and Practices . Because Jefferson 's goal was to educate students to become effective and participatory citizens , he addressed that theme . Eight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curricular interest for Jefferson , and his educational plan for Virginia public schools had elements of history , political science , geography , economics , and anthropology . Conclusion <p> Jefferson has stature within the social studies discipline because he promoted the need for students to learn a variety of social sciences , not just history . Furthermore , that conclusion also expands the common understanding of Jefferson 's educational thinking . Whereas citizenship education was the major goal of his faith in an educated public , it was not an exclusive one . Rather , Jefferson saw a need for all students who would attend his schools , regardless of which level , to learn social studies disciplines for their personal and professional benefit . Education for Jefferson was a lifelong endeavor , and to enjoy the benefits required the knowledge and skills provided by learning history , geography , and civics . <p> The traditional emphasis given to Jefferson 's belief in the need for a well-educated citizenry and his plan for the public financing of schools in Virginia does not fully recognize the extent to which he influenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is important for citizenship education programs in the twenty-first century and the latter offers an intriguing glimpse into the educational thinking of Jefferson , to compartmentalize his thinking on the proper education for young people in such a way does a disservice to his views on schooling . <p> By contextualizing his ideas about what a student should learn , and to a lesser extent about how that student should learn , as being foundational to the social studies brings to light the depth of the roots of the twentieth-century movement to create this new discipline . Democratizing the educational arena in the early twentieth century and revamping traditional curricula to make them more responsive to the social and political needs of the time were predicted by similar calls by Jefferson in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries . In that sense , Jefferson 's educational message is much broader and more liberating than previously described . The answer to the question of Thomas Jefferson 's whereabouts in the social studies can be found throughout its curriculum and teaching methods , and his educational contribution to today 's social studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
