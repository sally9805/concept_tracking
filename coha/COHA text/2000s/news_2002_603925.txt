<p> WASHINGTON  --  By all accounts , incoming Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott travels in insular circles . His base in the capital is the all-white U.S. Senate . His core voters at home in Mississippi are conservative whites of both parties . In 30 years of public life , he has made few inroads with black voters . <p> Even so , people were stunned last week when Lott said the country would have been better off if retiring Sen. Strom Thurmond , R-S.C. , had won his 1948 presidential campaign  --  a crusade for " states ' rights " to maintain segregation of the races . The bubbly statement , in honor of Thurmond 's 100th birthday , sent a jolt through the audience of senators , staffers and Republican loyalists at a party in a Senate office building . <p> " People were turning red-faced . They were shocked , " says columnist Armstrong Williams , a black conservative who attended Thurmond 's party . " There were senators there who were aghast at what he was saying . When he said it , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . ' It just upset me no end . " <p> It was several days before Lott 's remark caught up to those who were n't in the room . The party was Dec. 5 . The ( Columbia , S.C. ) State reported without comment Friday that Lott " said he was proud his home state , Mississippi , " had supported Thurmond for president . The first time the rest of the statement surfaced was Saturday in The Washington Post . <p> Now the incident has taken on all the signs of an avalanche gaining mass and velocity . <p> Lott apologized on two national broadcasts for his " terrible " words . Some Democrats and newspapers  --  among them The New York Times and Lott 's hometown Mississippi Press  --  say he should n't be majority leader . So many conservative columnists are calling for him to step aside that some suspect the hidden hand of an uneasy White House at work . Republicans are agonizing , mostly in private , and waiting to see whether Lott can hang onto his leadership position . <p> Some Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tennessee said his words were " interpreted unfairly . " Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said , " It 's time to accept Sen. Lott 's apology and move on . " <p> Democrats , academics and some other Republicans say Lott 's comments reinforce his reputation as a good ol ' boy and the stereotype of Southern Republicans as callous at best on race issues . The consequences go beyond Lott , Mississippi and the South . Lott , they say , has undercut President Bush 's efforts to make the GOP more welcoming to minorities and more attractive to moderates . <p> " Nobody 's talking about 1948 anymore , even in the South , " says Merle Black , a Southern politics authority at Emory University in Atlanta . " Lott revived matters that had been settled and were off the table . He 's now a permanently tainted spokesman for the Republican Party . " <p> Some call Lott the new Newt Gingrich of the GOP , recalling how Democrats were able to mobilize voters and raise money by invoking the controversial Gingrich when he was House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Family Research Council , says Democrats will hang Lott 's remarks " like an albatross " around the neck of the GOP in every drive to raise money and turn out voters . <p> Beyond politics , Connor says , the Lott remarks also damage the work conservative churches and individuals are doing to try to connect with African-Americans . <p> For instance , he worries about progress made last April when the Franklin Graham Crusade came to Tallahassee , Fla . Connor , chairman of the religious gathering staged by the Rev. Billy Graham 's son , says , " We built these marvelous bridges with black pastors and black communities . Those gains come slowly and at great price . A lot of effort has to be made to break down old stereotypes and old suspicions . When those gains are made you really cherish them . And then to have the remarks of a prominent leader undercut , " he sighs . " Thoughtless , careless remarks like this can have a devastating impact . " <p> Sen. Barry Goldwater of Arizona voted against the Civil Rights Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate that year , black voters defected in droves . The party of Abraham Lincoln and emancipation has had problems attracting minority voters ever since . For decades it did not try . <p> John Weaver , a consultant who worked for Democrats in the last election , says the Texas Republican Party did not " reach out to African-American voters in a consistent way or in a way that would attract them to be Republicans " when he was executive director in the 1980s . He says neither party should be proud of its past . <p> Lott 's first job in politics was for a segregationist Democratic congressman . He switched to the Republican Party to run for the House of Representatives in 1972 . <p> The party then " had absolutely no appeal to blacks , " Black says . Even now , says Marvin Overby , who taught Southern politics at the University of Mississippi in Oxford for nine years before moving to the University of Missouri this fall , the Mississippi Republican Party has " some very racist elements . " <p> Lott says he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for black colleges . Some analysts say Lott 's outreach to the black community has been minimal , especially compared with efforts by Thad Cochran , Mississippi 's other Republican senator . <p> " Cochran has gone out of his way to try to help with issues that black businesses care about , " Overby says . " Lott has not done that . He has not seemed to sense that that 's an important part of his constituency and people he should be trying to help . " <p> The contrast between the two politicians is reflected in their vote totals . Cochran received 32% of the black vote in 1996 . ( Statistics are not yet available for the election last month . ) In Lott 's last race , in 2000 , he received 11% of the black vote . <p> Rickey Cole , an Ovett , Miss. , vegetable farmer who is chairman of the state Democratic Party , says Lott 's remarks did not surprise people back home . " You all just got a rare glimpse of the Mississippi Trent Lott live and onstage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republican Party is going to try to recruit minorities and people who are progressive on race relations , they need to exorcise from within their ranks these neo-Confederates like Mr. Lott . " <p> The Senate is awash in courtesy , rooted in Thomas Jefferson 's notion that extreme politeness will help cool passions that might otherwise escalate into fist-fights or duels . People routinely shower compliments on colleagues whom they ca n't stand or believe are profoundly misguided . <p> Lott is a genial master of ceremonies in the Senate , known for hair that never moves and singing in a quartet with fellow senators . <p> In what some call his " apology tour " on Wednesday , he said his remarks at Thurmond 's birthday party were lighthearted and he just got " carried away . " Lott said Wednesday on Sean Hannity 's syndicated radio show that he had always " kidded " Thurmond about his career and told him he would have made a great president . " He lights up , he smiles at that . That 's the vein it was in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , ' I wish you 'd lost ? ' " <p> One Lott associate says the senator had prepared no remarks for the birthday party and was just trying to be funny . Others say they are mystified that such an experienced politician would make such a statement . <p> Among Republicans who did not return calls Thursday were former Senate majority leader Bob Dole , national Republican Party chairman Marc Racicot and Haley Barbour , a former party chairman preparing to run for governor of Mississippi . <p> Williams says it 's terrible that so few Republicans are speaking up . He says , " If we do n't condemn it and say to Mr. Lott , ' For the good of the party , resign , ' then we are just as culpable as he is. "
