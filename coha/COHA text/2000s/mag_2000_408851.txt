Contrary to conventional wisdom , kids are actually born hardwired to learn science and math . // LEARNING science and math is child 's play . More than that , a child 's brain is actually hardwired for learning and equipped by evolution with programs that enable , even require , it to explore and discover . New research on the brain and learning is changing old notions about how to teach children science and math-notions that have been at least partly responsible for the state of U.S. education today . We now know , for example , that an infant 's brain is not the tabula rasa , or blank slate , posited by philosopher John Locke in the 1670s . In fact , says Alison Gopnik , a cognitive psychologist at the University of California at Berkeley and coauthor of the 1999 book " The Scientist in the Crib , " a baby 's brain is well equipped to solve problems on its own . By age 3 , a child 's brain is twice as active as that of an adult . It has some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in an adult brain . " The implications for science education are clear , " says Gopnik . " First , we could teach many things earlier . The conventional wisdom was that children could n't be taught abstract concepts , could n't understand logic or causality , could n't understand biology until the later school years . That 's not true . They can understand simple ideas like growth and inheritance even as preschoolers . " Second , the very fact that they already know so much when they arrive at school and have intuitive theories about how the world works suggests that a good way to teach science is to build on these ideas . Just like scientists , kids are capable of altering their theories in light of what they observe as they grow . Children 's brains are hardwired for constructivist learning . " According to the tenets of constructivist learning , also called discovery learning , children acquire science and math skills and knowledge by exploration . It is a hands-on approach emphasizing experimentation , discussion , and group participation . The teacher in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or basic information as needed , and guides student discussions . Teachers have been gaining insight into , and Photograph // training in , constructivist methods through a number of innovative projects . One of the most comprehensive is the Deformed Frog Partnership , a collaboration between middle-school science teachers and technology and biology experts from the University of California . It engages students in trying to understand the increase in deformities in frog populations in North America . In a pilot program at a San Francisco middle school two years ago , students evaluated available evidence on the Internet and conducted in-class debates on the causes of the phenomenon . They went on field trips to ponds , raised tadpoles in the classroom , and performed hands-on dissections . The result was that these students came to understand not only the developmental biology of the frog , but the scientific process itself . " We had kids debating science on the playground , " declares Linda Shear , a technology consultant who works on the project . This constructivist approach is quite the opposite of the classical mode of science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or they memorize material from a textbook ) , and then tests them by making them regurgitate what they have learned . This is trying to write on the student 's " blank slate , " and has been notoriously ineffective . Witness the shabby performance of American high school seniors , who have performed well below expectations on international science and math tests . " Most of what we know we have to construct for ourselves , " says Lauren B. Resnick , codirector of the University of Pittsburgh 's Learning Research and Development Center . " The major change in constructivist theory in the past half-dozen years is an increased recognition of the social aspects of learning , like the classroom environment and interactions , " Resnick says . A social classroom encourages student exchanges and shared learning . And , says Resnick , growing evidence suggests conceptual math learning works : " The National Science Foundation-funded program Everyday Mathematics , which also stresses understanding of concepts , produced a marked change in the performance of Pittsburgh elementary and middle schoolers , with a three- to four-time improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national tests were so bad because most of the conventional math curricula are in bits and pieces , with no conceptual content . The new approaches do n't leave memorized computation out , but do n't focus on it either . " Resnick 's colleague Victoria Brill heads an ongoing program at the Pittsburgh center for city schools with many underprivileged children . Brill uses a constructivist technique , with group discussions , experimenting with different solution strategies , and building on students ' own informal knowledge and intuition . In the first year of the program , the median rankings of the mostly African-American first graders rose from the 30th percentile to higher than the 80th , measured on a national scale . Much research has shown that children 's brains are hardwired not just for science , but for math too . Resnick has collaborated with cognitive scientists analyzing the math skills of poor , essentially untutored street people in Brazil who eke out a living by selling lottery tickets . " These people , " she says , " who ca n't do paper arithmetic at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Based on this work and on her other experiences with children , she believes that humans are born with a primitive math preparedness , just as scientists like Noam Chomsky believe that we are born with an imprinted linguistic readiness . That is also the view of Brian Butterworth , professor of cognitive neuropsychology at University College in London . In his 1999 book " What Counts : How Every Brain Is Hardwired for Math , " he cites numerous experiments that were conducted in the early 1990s that prove that infants can in fact " count " at least up to three or four , without having been taught to do so . Thus babies have an innate sense of the number of things , a sense that can be developed before and during school years . From experience with patients suffering certain kinds of brain damage , psychologists know that the representation of numbers resides in that organ 's left parietal lobe . As it happens , that is also where finger and hand shapes are represented . Not a coincidence , says Butterworth ; finger use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mathematical prowess . So now we know why children , and many grownups , count on their fingers . Experiments conducted in France and the United States // Students work like scientists , gathering and analyzing data , In the Deformed Frog Partnership . // and reported last May have shed more light on where in the brain different kinds of mathematical activity take place . Using both behavioral studies and a brain scanning technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging , researchers led by Stanislas Dehaene of the Service Hospitalier Frederic Joilot in Orsay , France , concluded that exact mathematics-such as adding two numbers to get an exact sum-takes place in a quite different part of the brain than approximating how numbers relate to each other , such as thinking about whether the fraction ' 7/32 is larger or smaller than % . Rote arithmetic occupies the left frontal lobe , a part of the brain active when performing verbal tasks , like memorizing a laundry list . Estimating occupies the parietal lobes , seat of visual and spatial transformations . Approximating is a vital skill for mathematicians . Albert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs and images than on words and language . " Down the road , " says Elizabeth Spelke , professor of brain and cognitive sciences at MIT and one of the American researchers , " educators may look harder at the importance of developing children 's number sense . " She adds that the studies imply that children who are drilled in rote mathematics are learning skills far removed from those that enrich mathematical intuition . She also believes the study has implications for teaching math to bilingual students , because it suggests exact math knowledge may be stored in the brain in a form that depends on a specific language , one that he or she might not use as an adult . " Our results suggest that the switch from the language in which exact math was learned to a different one will not be easy . " Insight and intuition play a part in science learning too , but sometimes in a negative way . Studies by Michelene TH . Chi and colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh 's learning center have revealed that children may arrive in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misconceptions that have arisen from their previous efforts to make sense of what they have observed about the world . Physics learning is rife with such misconceptions . For example , students are asked to imagine that a ball is forcibly injected into one end of a hollow curved tube lying flat on a table and rolls out the other end . When asked to draw the path of the emerging ball , most draw a curved rather than a straight path despite what they have learned about inertia . Studies of students 12 to 15 years old found that although they could see the connection between a flashlight and a spot of light on a wall , they were unable to conceive of light existing in the space in between . High schoolers often believe that force must be continuously applied to keep an object moving , despite being taught Newton 's principle that a moving object keeps moving unless acted on by a force . As a result of these misconceptions , says professor of education Edward L. Smith at Michigan State University , " students give up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counterintuitive and does not fit with their previous ideas . So they conclude that science just does n't make sense , and decide simply to memorize the textbook . " The whole experience leads them to drop out of science courses at the first opportunity , " Smith concludes . Teachers can counteract this , according to Smith . They can foster classroom experiences that help students learn how to adjust their original ideas in the light of reason , based on factual evidence . " At some point the teacher will have to introduce a new concept , " to help the process along , says Smith . " When teaching young children about the weather , for example , we introduce the idea of moving masses of air , or fronts , when the student 's naive ideas of why weather can change from day to day do n't stand up to what they observe . " Framing the issues so as to test them is , of course , at the core of the scientific method . From observation of the natural world , a hypothesis is stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ validity . But the experiment must be " unconfounded " - that is , designed so that only one variable at a time changes . ( In medicine , for example , the only way to determine if a drug is effective is to use two groups of patients who are identical in every respect except that one group gets the drug and a control group does not . ) For children to acquire this fundamental scientific reasoning skill , David Klahr believes , they must be taught it directly . Klahr is a professor of psychology at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh . He has devised a technique called the " Control of Variables Strategy . " In a study that has continued for five years , Klahr worked initially with second- , third- , and fourth-grade children in Pittsburgh area private schools , and more recently with fourth-grade science teachers . The results of his research are being published in a forthcoming book that will be titled " Designing for Science . " " In a 15-minute session , you can tell kids how to do something and they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply it in other contexts , " says Klahr . " Suppose you want to learn whether a long spring stretches more than a short one , or a skinny spring more than a fat one , when a weight is hung from it . We taught kids how to design spring experiments using control-of-variables strategy . " There were only four variableslength , width , wire size , and amount of weight . The kids were taught to vary only one at a time while keeping the other three constant , and to record the results . " So they learned how to conduct a controlled experiment , " Klahr continues . " Once we had empowered them , they could use the skill to make discoveries . And they wound up knowing a lot about springs - knowledge that we had never taught them . " Depending on what you want to do , discovery learning can be very effective , " says Klahr , who speaks for many about how best to inspire science and math learning . " But you may have to directly give the children the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MOZART MANIA THE ALLEGED BENEFITS of the " Mozart effect " have produced something like a gold rush , with parents hoping to strike musical paydirt for their children . The original source of the enthusiasm was a 1993 study by Frances Rauscher at the University of California in Irvine and colleagues . It found that college students who listened to 10 minutes of a Mozart piano sonata had improved performance of spatial-temporal tasks , those involving mental imagery and time sequences , immediately afterward . Somehow this finding became distorted into a claim ( not Rauscher 's ) that Listening to the music of Mozart made babies smarter . Eventually , then-Gov . Zell Miller of Georgia proposed the idea of providing every newborn Georgia peach with a Mozart compact disc , and today the state of Florida mandates that school children listen to classical music every day . Some recent attempts to replicate the original findings , including those by researchers at the University of Windsor in Canada and Appalachian State University in North Carolina , have failed to do so . Rauscher , now an assistant professor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retorts that the design of these experiments did not conform to that of the original . Meanwhile , preschooters are listening to at kinds of music as part of the Early Childhood Music Project at Cornell University 's Early Childhood Center . Elizabeth Stilwell , the center director , is enthusiastic about the benefit of music for children . " We 've always known that music is great for kids , " she says , " but now research shows that music should be an essential part of early childhood . It 's fun , creative , and it 's a proven way to develop areas of the brain for Later academic tasks such as reading and math . " The research Stilwell refers to is a study published in March 1999 that found that second graders in Los Angeles scored 27 percent higher than other children on proportional math and fractions tests after they were given four months of keyboard training on the piano . So should you play Wolfgang for your children or not ? As with the answer to whether chicken soup might be good for colds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAY NEVER have gotten past high school biology , but you can still help your kids learn about science . That 's a reassuring message for parents from the National Science Teachers Association . The first step is for parents is to Let go of some myths : that science is especially hard , that you have to know a Lot about it to help your kids , that you need special equipment . On the contrary . Parents can help simply by sharing science experiences-such as visits to museums , airports , farms , dairies , shorelines , and parks-and talking about what they see . No equipment is needed , nor any special knowledge , to walk with a child in the woods and compare the shapes of different leaves and see if they fall into categories , or to put a stick in the sand at the ocean 's edge and observe how the water level changes with the tides , or to measure how long it takes an ice cube to melt on different surfaces . In this way , parents can focus on developing skills such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , experimenting , estimating , measuring , and sharing information . Parents can also talk about school science with their children , and check the textbook for examples of activities that can supplement and reinforce class work . Above all , parents can foster the knowledge that science is a powerful and essential way of Looking at and understanding the world . It 's not just for nerds. // <p>
