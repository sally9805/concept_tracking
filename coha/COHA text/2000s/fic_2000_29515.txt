" You 'd think that anyone who 'd been shot three times and almost became an organ donor would try to avoid dangerous situations in the future . But , no , I must have this unconscious wish to take myself out of the gene pool or something . Anyway , I 'm John Corey , formerly of the NYPD , Homicide , now working as a Special Contract Agent for the Federal Anti-Terrorist Task Force . I was sitting in the back of a yellow cab on my way from 26 Federal Plaza in lower Manhattan to John F. Kennedy International Airport with a Pakistani suicide driver behind the wheel . It was a nice spring day , a Saturday , moderate traffic on the Shore Parkway , sometimes known as the Belt Parkway , and recently renamed POW /MIA Parkway to avoid confusion . It was late afternoon , and seagulls from a nearby landfill-formerly known as a garbage dump-were crapping on the taxi 's windshield . I love spring . I was n't headed off on vacation or anything like that-I was reporting for work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization that not too many people know about , which is just as well . The ATTF is divided into sections which focus on specific bunches of troublemakers and bomb chuckers , like the Irish Republican Army , Puerto Rican Independence Movement , black radicals , and other groups that will go unnamed . I 'm in the Mideastern section , which is the biggest group and maybe the most important , though to be honest , I do n't know much about Mideastern terrorists . But I was supposed to be learning on the job . So , to practice my skills , I started up a conversation with the Pakistani guy whose name was Fasid , and who forall I know is a terrorist , though he looked and talked like an okay guy . I asked him , " What was that place you came from ? " " Islamabad . The capital . " " Really ? How long have you been here ? " " Ten years . " " You like it here ? " " Sure . Who does n't ? " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's always bad-mouthing America . Wants to move to New Zealand . " " I have an uncle in New Zealand . " " No kidding ? Anybody left in Islamabad ? " He laughed , then asked me , " You meeting somebody at the airport ? " " Why do you ask ? " " No luggage . " " Hey , you 're good . " " So , you 're meeting somebody ? I could hang around and take you back to the city . " Fasid 's English was pretty good-slang , idioms , and all that . I replied , " I have a ride back . " " You sure ? I could hang around . " Actually , I was meeting an alleged terrorist who 'd surrendered himself to the U.S. Embassy in Paris , but I did n't think that was information I needed to share with Fasid . I said , " You a Yankee fan ? " " Not anymore . " Whereupon he launched into a tirade against Steinbrenner , Yankee Stadium , the price of tickets , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrorists are clever , sounding just like loyal citizens . Anyway , I tuned the guy out and thought about how I 'd wound up here . As I indicated , I was a homicide detective , one of New York 's Finest , if I do say so . A year ago this month , I was playing dodge-the-bullets with two Hispanic gentlemen up on West 2nd Street in what was probably a case of mistaken identity , or sport shooting , since there seemed to be no reason for the attempted whack . Life is funny sometimes . Anyway , the perps were still at large , though I had my eye out for them , as you might imagine . After my near-death experience and upon release from the hospital , I accepted my Uncle Harry 's offer to stay at his summer house on Long Island to convalesce . The house is located about a hundred road miles from West 2nd Street , which was fine . Anyway , while I was out there , I got involved with this double murder of a husband and wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also , one of the women I fell in love with , Beth Penrose by name , is still sort of in my life . While all this was going on out on eastern Long Island , my divorce became final . And as if I was n't already having a bad R &R; at the beach , I wound up making the professional acquaintance of a schmuck on the double homicide case named Ted Nash of the Central Intelligence Agency who I took a big dislike to , and who hated my guts in return , and who , lo and behold , was now part of my ATTF team . It 's a small world , but not that small , and I do n't believe in coincidence . There was also another guy involved with that case , George Foster , an FBI agent , who was okay , but not my cup of tea either . In any case , it turns out that this double homicide was not a Federal case , and Nash and Foster disappeared , only to reappear in my life about four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team . But no sweat , I 've put in for a transfer to the ATTF 's Irish Republican Army section , which I will probably get . I do n't have any real feelings about the IRA either way , but at least the IRA babes are easy to look at , the guys are more fun than your average Arab terrorist , and the Irish pubs are primo . I could do some real good in the anti-IRA section . Really . Anyway , after all this mess out on Long Island , I get offered this great choice of being hauled in front of the NYPD disciplinary board for moonlighting or whatever , or taking a three-quarter medical disability and going away . So I took the medical , but also negotiated a job at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan where I live . Before I got shot , I 'd taught a class at John Jay as an Adjunct Professor , so I was n't asking for much and I got it . Starting in January , I was teaching two night classes at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bored out of my mind , so my ex-partner , Dom Fanelli , knows about this Special Contract Agent program with the Feds where they hire former law enforcement types to work with ATTF . I apply , I 'm accepted , probably for all the wrong reasons , and here I am . The pay 's good , the perks are okay , and the Federal types are mostly schmucks . I have this problem with Feds , like most cops do , and not even sensitivity training would help . But the work seems interesting . The ATTF is a unique and , I may say , elite group ( despite the schmucks ) that only exists in New York City and environs . It 's made up mostly of NYPD detectives who are great guys , FBI , and some quasi-civilian guys like me hired to round out the team , so to speak . Also , on some teams , when needed , are CIA prima donnas , and also some DEA-Drug Enforcement Agency people who know their business , and know about connections between the drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people from the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms of Waco , Texas , fame , plus cops from surrounding suburban counties , and New York State Police . There are other Federal types from agencies I ca n't mention , and last but not least , we have a few Port Authority detectives assigned to some teams . These PA guys are helpful at airports , bus terminals , train stations , docks , some bridges and tunnels under their control , and other places , like the World Trade Center , where their little empire extends . We have it all pretty much covered , but even if we did n't , it sounds really impressive . The ATTF was one of the main investigating groups in the World Trade Center bombing and the TWA 800 explosion off Long Island . But sometimes we take the show on the road . For instance , we also sent a team to help out with the African embassy bombings , though the name ATTF was hardly mentioned in the news , which is how they like it . All of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet since I 've been here , which is how I like it . The reason the almighty Feds decided to team up with the NYPD and form the ATTF , by the way , is that most FBI people are not from New York and do n't know a pastrami sandwich from the Lexington Avenue subway . The CIA guys are a little slicker and talk about cafs in Prague and the night train to Istanbul and all that crap , but New York is not their favorite place to be . The NYPD has street smarts , and that 's what you need to keep track of Abdul Salami-Salami and Paddy O'Bad and Pedro Viva Puerto Rico and so on . Your average Fed is Wendell Wasp from West Wheatfield , Iowa , whereas the NYPD has mucho Hispanics , lots of blacks , a million Irish , and even a few Muslims now , so you get this cultural diversity on the force that is not only politically cool and correct , but actually useful and effective . And when the ATTF ca n't steal active-duty NYPD people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disability , I 'm armed , dangerous , and nasty . So there it is . We were approaching JFK , and I said to Fasid , " So , what did you do for Easter ? " " Easter ? I do n't celebrate Easter . I 'm Muslim . " See how clever I am ? The Feds would 've sweated this guy for an hour to make him admit he was a Muslim . I got it out of him in two seconds . Just kidding . But , you know , I really have to get out of the Mideast section and into the IRA bunch . I 'm part Irish and part English , and I could work both sides of that street . Fasid exited the Shore-Belt-POW /MIA Parkway and got on the Van Wyck Expressway heading south into JFK . These huge planes were sort of floating overhead making whining noises , and Fasid called out to me , " Where you going ? " " International Arrivals . " " Which airline ? " " There 's more than one ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No kidding ? Just drive . " Fasid shrugged , just like an Israeli cabbie . I was starting to think that maybe he was a Mossad agent posing as a Pakistani . Or maybe this job was getting to me . There 's all these colored and numbered signs along the expressway , and I let the guy go to the International Arrivals , a huge structure with all the airline logos , one after the other out front , and he asked again , " Which airline ? " " I do n't like any of these . Keep going . " Again , he shrugged . I directed him onto another road , and we were now going to the other side of the big airport . This is good trade craft , to see if anybody 's following you . I learned this in some spy novel or maybe a James Bond movie . I was trying to get into this anti-terrorist thing . I got Fasid pointed in the right direction and told him to stop in front of a big office-type building on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . This whole area is full of nondescript airport services buildings and warehouses , and no one notices anybody 's comings and goings , plus the parking is easy . I paid the guy , tipped him , and asked for a receipt in the exact amount . Honesty is one of my few faults . Fasid gave me a bunch of blank receipts and asked again , " You want me to hang around ? " " I would n't if I were you . " I went into the lobby of the building , a ep1rs960s sort of crap modern architecture , and instead of an armed guard with an Uzi like they have all over the world , there 's just a sign that says restricted area-authorized personnel only . So , assuming you read English , you know if you 're welcome or not . I went up a staircase and down a long corridor of gray steel doors , some marked , some numbered , some neither . At the end of the corridor was a door with a nice blue-and-white sign that said conquistador @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , but like everything else about the Conquistador Club , it was a phony . What I had to do was to press my right thumb on the translucent face of the scanner , which I did . About two seconds later , the metrobiotic genie said to itself , " Hey , that 's John Corey 's thumb-let 's open the door for John . " And did the door swing open ? No , it slid into the wall as far as its dummy doorknob . Do I need this nonsense ? Also there 's a video scanner overhead , in case your thumbprint got screwed up with a chocolate bar or something , and if they recognize your face , they also open the door , though in my case they might make an exception . So I went in , and the door slid closed automatically behind me . I was now in what appeared to be the reception area of an airline travelers ' club . Why there 'd be such a club in a building that 's not near a passenger terminal is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , and I 'm still waiting for an answer . But I know the answer , which is that when the CIA culture is present , you get this kind of smoke-and-mirrors silliness . These clowns waste time and money on stagecraft , just like in the old days when they were trying to impress the KGB . What the door needed was a simple sign that said keep out . Anyway , behind the counter was Nancy Tate , the receptionist , a sort of Miss Moneypenny , the model of efficiency and repressed sexuality , and all that . She liked me for some reason and greeted me cheerily , " Good afternoon , Mr. Corey . " " Good afternoon , Ms. Tate . " " Everyone has arrived . " " I was delayed by traffic . " " Actually , you 're ten minutes early . " " Oh . . . " " I like your tie . " " I took it off a dead Bulgarian on the night train to Istanbul . " She giggled . Anyway , the reception area was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so forth , and on the wall directly behind Nancy was another logo of the fictitious Conquistador Club . And for all I knew , Ms. Tate was a hologram . To the left of Ms. Tate was an entranceway marked conference and business area that actually led to the interrogation rooms and holding cells , which I guess could be called the Conference and Business Area . To the right , a sign announced lounge and bar . I should be so lucky . That was in fact the way to the communications and operations center . Ms. Tate said to me , " Ops Center . There are five people including yourself . " " Thanks . " I walked through the doorway , down a short hallway , and into a dim , cavernous , and windowless room that held desks , computer consoles , cubicles , and such . On the big rear wall was a huge , computer-generated color map of the world that could be programmed to a detailed map of whatever you needed , like downtown Islamabad . Typical of most Federal facilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Money is no problem in Fedland . In any case , this facility was n't my actual workplace , which is in the aforementioned 26 Federal Plaza in lower Manhattan . But this was where I had to be on this Saturday afternoon to meet and greet some Arab guy who was switching sides and needed to be taken safely downtown for a few years of debriefing . I kind of ignored my teammates and made for the coffee bar , which , unlike the one in my old detective squad room , is neat , clean , and well stocked , compliments of the Federal taxpayers . I fooled around with the coffee awhile , which was my way of avoiding my colleagues for a few more minutes . I got the coffee the right color and noticed a tray of donuts that said NYPD and a tray of croissants and brioche that said CIA and a tray of oatmeal cookies that said FBI . Someone had a sense of humor . Anyway , the coffee bar was on the operations side of the big room and the commo side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady duty agent was up there monitoring all the gidgets and gadgets . My team , on the operations side , was sitting around somebody 's empty desk , engaged in conversation . The team consisted of the aforementioned Ted Nash of the CIA , and George Foster of the FBI , plus Nick Monti of the NYPD , and Kate Mayfield of the FBI . WASP , WASP , Wop , WASP . Kate Mayfield came to the coffee bar and began making herself tea . She is supposed to be my mentor , whatever that means . As long as it does n't mean partner . She said to me , " I like that tie . " " I once strangled a Ninja warrior to death with it . It 's my favorite . " " Really ? Hey , how are you getting along here ? " " You tell me . " " Well , it 's too soon for me to tell you . You tell me why you put in for the IRA section . " " Well , the Muslims do n't drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports , and the women ca n't be seduced . " " That 's the most racist , sexist remark I 've heard in years . " " You do n't get around much . " " This is not the NYPD , Mr. Corey . " " No , but I 'm NYPD . Get used to it . " " Are we through attempting to shock and appall ? " " Yeah . Look , Kate , I thank you for your meddling-I mean mentoring-but in about a week , I 'll be in the IRA section or off the job . " She did n't reply . I looked at her as she messed around with a lemon . She was about thirty , I guess , blond , blue eyes , fair skin , athletic kind of build , perfect pearly whites , no jewelry , light makeup , and so on . Wendy Wasp from Wichita . She had not one flaw that I could see , not even a zit on her face or a fleck of dandruff on her dark blue blazer . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She probably played three sports in high school , took cold showers , belonged to 4-H , and organized pep rallies in college . I hated her . Well , not really , but about the only thing we had in common was some internal organs , and not even all of those . Also , her accent was hard to identify , and I remembered that Nick Monti said her father was an FBI guy , and they 'd lived in different places around the country . She turned and looked at me , and I looked at her . She had these piercing eyes , the color of blue dye No. 2 , like they use in ice pops . She said to me , " You came to us highly recommended . " " By who ? Whom ? " " Whom . By some of your old colleagues in Homicide . " I did n't reply . " Also , " she said , " by Ted and George . " She nodded toward Schmuck and Putz . I almost choked on my coffee . Why these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total mystery . " They are n't fond of you , but you impressed them on that Plum Island case . " " Yeah , I even impressed myself on that one . " " Why do n't you give the Mideast section a try ? " She added , " If Ted and George are the problem , we can switch you to another team within the section . " " I love Ted and George , but I really have my heart set on the anti-IRA section . " " Too bad . This is where the real action is . This is a career builder . " She added , " The IRA are pretty quiet and well behaved in this country . " " Good . I do n't need a new career anyway . " " The Palestinians and the Islamic groups , on the other hand , are potentially dangerous to national security . " " No potentially ' about it , " I replied . " World Trade Center . " She did n't reply . I 'd come to discover that these three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harbor . " The intelligence community got caught with their pants down on that one , but came back and solved the case , so it was a draw . She continued , " The whole country is paranoid about a Mideast terrorist biological attack or a nuclear or chemical attack . You saw that on the Plum Island case . Right ? " " Right . " " So ? Everything else in the ATTF is a backwater . The real action is in the Mideast section , and you look like a man of action . " She smiled . I smiled in return . I asked her , " What 's it to you ? " " I like you . " I raised my eyebrows . " I like New York Neanderthals . " " I 'm speechless . " " Think about it . " " Will do . " I glanced at a TV monitor close by and saw that the flight we were waiting for , Trans-Continental ep1rs75 from Paris , was inbound and on time . I asked Ms. Mayfield , " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe two or three hours . An hour of paperwork here , then back to Federal Plaza , with our alleged defector , then we 'll see . " " See what ? " " Are you in a rush to get somewhere ? " " Sort of . " " I feel badly that national security is interfering with your social life . " I did n't have a good reply to that , so I said , " I 'm a big fan of national security . I 'm yours until six p.m . " " You can leave whenever you want . " She took her tea and rejoined our colleagues . So , I stood there with my coffee , and considered the offer to take a hike . In retrospect , I was like the guy standing in quicksand , watching it cover my shoes , curious to see how long it would take to reach my socks , knowing I could leave anytime soon . Unfortunately , the next time I glanced down , it was up to my knees .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
