<p> Around the corner from a check-cashing center , on the top floor of a three-family home , Ron Siler Sr. sat in a small living room with the lights off . <p> An old television set hissed while he waited for the arrival of the tenant downstairs , the Olympic boxer who bears his name . <p> Impatient , Siler Sr. navigated the steps and knocked on the door of his son , Ron Siler Jr. , and asked him to come upstairs to watch a boxing tape with him . Siler Jr . lives with his five children , all boys , and one of the two mothers of his children . He is busy . <p> " Dad , " Siler Jr . said , " I need some personal time . " <p> " But you have to be the best , " said his father , prodding until his son gave in . " All I ask is that you trust in me and follow my lead . " <p> This is the pact that father and son have made during their life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They have lived at 11 addresses , including one apartment where Siler Jr. , as an infant , slept in a dresser drawer next to his father 's bed . They lived in another apartment that burned down when a neighbor left some hot dogs cooking on a stove . <p> But nothing  --  not even jail  --  has kept the 24-year-old Siler Jr. , a skinny , 112-pounder , from becoming the best American amateur boxer in his class and a favorite to win a medal at the Olympic Games in Athens . <p> From the moment Siler Sr. placed a punching bag in the middle of the living room so Siler Jr . could work off his temper , they have worked as coach and protege to forge a boxing career out of ashes . <p> They have come here , to this slanted house on a slanted hill near downtown Cincinnati , to paint the final touches on what they hope will be Olympic gold . <p> " The only thing is , he talks to me 24-7 , " Siler Jr . said . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you got ta work on that , we need to work on this . ' Sometimes I have to tell him , ' Save it for the gym , ' and he 'll be like , ' No , no , no , you have to learn outside the ring , too . " ' <p> Despite occasional friction , there is mutual respect . Each is undersized ( Siler Jr . is 5 feet 6 , his father 5-3 1/2 ) . Each has spent time running the streets in Over-the-Rhine , a neighborhood that has seen its share of death on its doorsteps . <p> " He ran with a gang , " Siler Jr . said of his father , " but he did n't want me to go that way . He wanted me to prosper in life . He always tells me stories , and his friends always tell me stories , that he was one of the toughest little guys on the streets . He was the type of guy that was going to hit the big guy first . Nobody messed with little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowed down . He is married with 10 children , including Siler Jr . His past exists only in memories , but those memories color his life and that of his son . Upheaval has been a constant companion , poverty a family friend . <p> " My momma carried me to my daddy on the corner and said , ' Here , " ' Siler Sr. recalled of his own childhood . " Then he gave me to his momma . " <p> Siler Sr. lived with his grandmother until she died , when he was 13 . He became an orphan , coming into contact with " some people that made sure I went to school , " he said . " To be frank , it was a whorehouse . There were three kitty-cat clubs , and I used to sit outside and wash the johns ' cars when they went inside . I did n't say much and I did n't bother anybody . " <p> And at day 's end , Siler Sr. said he went inside . The routine lasted about four years , Siler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space , " he said . " There were about eight women , and I listened to all of their weird stories , but they took care of me . " <p> When Siler Sr. reached adulthood , he kept a nomadic lifestyle . He drank , chased women and bounced between jobs cooking and cleaning in restaurants and hotels . <p> One woman he dated , a 19-year-old named Sharolynn Harper of Knoxville , Tenn. , who already had two children , wanted to marry him , but Siler Sr. would not commit . When she became pregnant with Siler Sr. 's child , the couple made a decision . <p> " We decided that , should we ever break up , he would raise the child , " Harper said from Chattanooga , Tenn. , where she works as a telecommunications technician . " It was not an easy decision . " <p> On April 8 , 1980 , Siler Jr . was born . Two years later , after Siler Sr. and Harper broke up , he and the child boarded a Greyhound bus . <p> Siler Jr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship a fragile foundation built on the occasional phone call . <p> " Sometimes I knew their address , sometimes I did n't have a clue , " Harper said . " I would always tell his father , if he ever needed anything or if he felt he could n't raise him , to let me know . " <p> When Siler Jr . was a teenager , he almost moved to Tennessee to be with Harper , but she said he did not feel comfortable . <p> " There have been times when I wanted to tell him , ' Come and live with me , baby , ' but I have to let him be a man , too , " said Harper , who has since married . " I 'm waiting for the day where we can sit down and have enough time to laugh together and , more likely , cry together . I know he might have hate in his heart . I just want him to know that he was loved , too . He was not a throwaway baby . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he never felt abandoned . " The only time I ever really called for her was when I was getting whippings , " he said . " I 'm thankful that I had a mother , and I 'm thankful she called my father to come and get me instead of just leaving me out there for anybody to have . " <p> Having Siler Jr . as a constant companion changed Siler Sr. , but only by degrees . Each recalled an incident when the son was 7 , waiting for his father to return home from a bar across the street . Siler Sr. and his friends were inside playing chess for drinks . Siler Sr. was the big winner that night . <p> " He was drunk and he was walking up the middle of the street , " said Siler Jr. , who had gone outside to meet his father and take him home . " He was holding my hand and I was grabbing on . " <p> When Siler Jr . was 10 , his father , a fan of martial arts movies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching boxing on television . <p> He taught Siler Jr. , who is right-handed , the unorthodox style of throwing jabs with the right hand instead of the left . <p> As punishment , Siler Sr. would tie his son 's left arm behind his back and make him throw punches only with the right . <p> The opportunities for disciplining Siler Jr . were many . When he was 14 , the city 's low-income housing authority evicted Siler Jr . and his father because the son had been caught selling drugs . <p> " My father did n't whip me , I was just embarrassed that he lost his house , " Siler Jr . said . " I do n't know if my father knows how much it hurt me that I did that . When I was selling drugs to dope fiends , I was like , ' I 'm getting out of character . This is n't even me . ' After I got caught , I never did it again . " <p> But two years ago , police did arrest him again , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Already on probation for receiving stolen property , Siler Jr . served almost one year of a 17-month sentence in a Dayton , Ohio , correctional facility . <p> To this day , Siler Jr . insists police made a mistake . His father believes him . <p> " I looked at him through those bars , " Siler Sr. said , " and he told me , ' Daddy , I 've done some things and I 've got locked up for them . But I 'm being locked up for something I did n't do . " ' <p> Siler Sr. , who had also spent time in jail as a younger man , told his son that his boxing career and his life were in jeopardy . Siler Jr . said he listened . <p> " I 've taken in a lot of wisdom , " Siler Jr . said . " I learned from the streets and hung out on the street . I became closer to my father . I realize , through all the trouble I 've been through , all the controversy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what . My father never turned his back . " <p> The lesson , Siler Jr . said , will be passed down to his children , who are the main reason he will turn professional after the Olympics , regardless of how he does in Athens . <p> " I want them to go to school , " Siler Jr . said . " I want them to do whatever they want to do , as long as it 's positive . If they want to box , I 'll let them box . If they want to play tennis , if they want to play hockey , if they want to be a ballerina , if that 's what they want to do , that 's all they are going to do . I 'm going to encourage them .

It was only about the fifth time they had seen each other since he moved in with Siler Sr. , some 22 years ago . <p> " We had a big , long hug , " Siler Jr . said . " She told me I made her real proud when I told her I need to talk to a lawyer before I sign anything . She said I sounded like a grown man when I said that . " <p> Harper said of her son : " I tell him sometimes , he was very lucky to have had his father raise him . For one thing , had I raised him , he would not have been boxing at all . I would have focused more on education . He 's been through a lot of things that he would not have gone through had he been with me . Maybe it was good for him . <p> " Sometimes I say I wished I had raised him . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ URL : http : //www.nytimes.com With hands so fast , a workout approaches .
