Penguins , as we all know , are the most readily anthropomorphized of all birds . They totter about upright , with their flipper arms and their tuxedo markings . We also learn from Luc Jacquet 's March of the Penguins that they are , like an ever increasing number of humans , serially monogamous . Every year emperor penguins meet , mate and remain faithfully bound  --  at least until their single offspring is walking and squawking . <P> But these are animals that suffer for their families . They 're obliged to trek some 70 miles to their breeding ground ( where the ice is thick enough to support the enormous colony ) . There they all approach starvation during the dark , 80-below-zero winter , the father protecting the egg while the mother returns to the ocean for food , which she stores in her belly and disgorges to the hatched chick . She then takes over the baby sitting while the father makes the same journey . And so on . <P> Frankly , all that plodding about gets a little , well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble about the birds ' dutifulness , about the mothers ' response to a chick 's death and about director Jacquet 's refusal to impose human emotions on his subjects . Above all , the harsh blue-and-white beauty of this frozen world and the black-and-white birds assiduously heeding their ancient instincts  --  which bring life to a place where , in all logic , it should not exist  --  are very moving . It 's a gentle film about somewhat alien beings , who entertain us by creating instead of destroying .
