Chapter One LORENZO BROWN OPENED his eyes . He stared at a cracked plaster ceiling and cleared his head . Lorenzo was not in a cot but in a clean , full-size bed . In an apartment with doors that opened and shut when he wanted them to . A place where he could walk free . Lorenzo swung his feet over the side of the mattress . His dog , a medium-size mix named Jasmine , rose from her square of remnant carpet , stretched , and shook herself awake . She came to him , her nails clicking on the hardwood floor , and touched her nose to his knee . He rubbed behind her ears , stroked her neck , and patted her flanks . Jasmine 's coat was cream colored , with tan and brown shotgunned across the fur . Lorenzo had saved her from the shelter on New York Avenue the night before her scheduled euthanization . He passed by scores of doomed animals every day but had never taken one home . It was her eyes , he supposed , that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He tried not to think too hard on the ones he 'd passed by . He could n't save them all . All he knew was , this was one good dog . " Morning , " said Lorenzo . Jasmine looked at him with those beautiful coffee bean eyes . Seemed like she was smiling too . The stand-up fan in the corner of the room blew warm air across them both . The clock radio that had woken him played on . He kept its dial set on 95.5 , WPGC . Huggy Low Down , a comedian in street-fool character , was talking with Donnie Simpson , the morning deejay , who 'd been on the air in D.C. since Brown was a kid . It was their morning conversation , conducted by phone . " Donnie ? " " Yes , Huggy ? " " Donnie . " " Yes , Huggy . " " You know what time it is , do n't you ? " " I think so , Huggy . " " It 's time to announce the Bama of the Week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ echoed in the room . Same back-and-forth , every day . Huggy could be flat-out funny , though . And when he spun music , Simpson tended to play old school , which Lorenzo preferred . Lorenzo could n't get behind that death romance thing anymore . Lorenzo Brown peed and brushed his teeth . He swallowed two ibuprofens to fend off the headache he knew would come . He washed down a C and a multivitamin as well . Still in his boxer shorts , he returned to his room , where he did stretching exercises and crunches on a camping mat he 'd laid on the floor . He then worked out with forty-pound dumbbells in front of a wall mirror , pyramid sets that left a rope of vein popping on each of his arms . He did some triceps curls as well . He finished with pull-ups on a bar he 'd hung in the door frame , bending his legs at the knees to accommodate his height . Lorenzo no longer did push-ups . They reminded him unpleasantly of the five hundred push-ups he had done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . RACHEL LOPEZ got up on one elbow , reached for the snooze bar on her clock radio , and silenced the banter coming from the morning deejay and his provocateur partner . She let her head drop back onto the pillow . Her stomach flipped , and a dull ache came from behind her closed eyes . This will be my morning : three aspirins , no breakfast . Coffee and a cigarette , then out the door . Today is a road day . Get up and do your job . She opened her eyes and kicked weakly at the sheets , which smelled faintly of cheap male cologne . She got herself up to a sitting position on the edge of the bed and turned the alarm off . The clock radio , a graduation gift from her father , was a Sony Dream Machine , a simple white cube that had looked ultramodern back in ' 92 . " To wake you up for work now , little girl . No one is going to do that for you anymore . You 're going to need the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends . But that wo n't last too long . Your body will reject it . Too many late nights ; you ca n't mix them with work . " I 'm still mixing them , Popi . The bad Rachel and the good . Rachel showered , shampooing her hair and thoroughly washing her sex . In her bathrobe , at a small table set by an open window , she had her coffee and smoked the day 's first cigarette . Afterward , she dressed in a loose , lightweight cotton shirt worn out over relaxed jeans and sneakers . The clothing was utilitarian gear of the Gap school of conformity , the styles chosen to hide her shape . She put on no makeup and added no shine product to her shoulder-length black hair . She was not trying to look unattractive . She was simply aiming to discourage any sexual feelings on the part of the men and women she encountered every day . At the front door of her functional apartment , she stopped and gathered her tools : several manila files , a clipboard holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notations , a couple of pens , her cell phone , her badge , and the keys to her car . She glanced at the mirror hung above the table and looked into her dark eyes . Not bad , she thought . Even without the war paint , and with what I did to myself last night , I still look pretty good . LORENZO BROWN ate a bowl of Cheerios while standing in his Pullman kitchen , then showered and changed into his uniform . Walking to the front door , he passed a worn sofa and armchair , and stopped to adjust his grandmother 's hope chest , centered behind the sofa 's back . The hope chest sat on an old oval throw rug ; beneath the throw rug was a rectangle that Lorenzo had cut out and replaced snugly in the hardwood floor . At the apartment 's entrance , Lorenzo picked up a chain leash with a looped leather strap that hung on a nail he had driven into the wall . Jasmine heard the clatter of the chain and joined him at the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived on the second and third floors of the row house where Lorenzo stayed , had left him a long plastic bag , the one the Post got delivered in , on the porch . As he always did , Robie had put the bag under half a brick so that it would not blow away . Lorenzo slipped the bag into his pocket and went down concrete steps to the street . He and Jasmine walked east on Otis Place , up a grade into the sun , along brick row houses with wooden porches fronted by columns , some of the homes painted and kept up nice , others in disrepair . Sturdy oak trees grew on the government strip along the curb . Lorenzo went up the block , stopping at the short , rundown stretch of 6th Street that was the cut-through from Otis to Newton as Jasmine peed beside a tree . Down there at the corner of Newton and 6th , where Nigel Johnson 's mother still stayed , Lorenzo could see a cluster of parked cars , new and late-model Lexus and BMW coupes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spinners , in the mix . A couple of young men leaned against their rides . The Lexus , a black GS430 with dual pipes and aftermarket rims , belonged to Nigel . Lorenzo assumed that Nigel was in there behind that tinted glass , sitting under the wheel , talking on his Nextel . Few in Nigel 's profession had their troops up and on the street at this early hour , but that was Nigel through and through . He 'd had that kind of ambition , and an almost blinding work ethic , since he was a kid . The two of them had run these Park View streets together , going back almost twenty-five years . As Jasmine finished her business , Lorenzo pulled gently on her leash . They passed the home of Joe Carver , another of Lorenzo 's old neighborhood running boys , now living with his aunt . Joe 's pickup , a red-and-white F-150 of midnineties vintage , was not along the curb , which meant he was already gone for the day . Joe had been getting steady work as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facility in Kentucky , since he 'd come out . He 'd been on a construction site on North Capitol , south of New York Avenue , for the past six months . Lorenzo walked along Park View Elementary , where he had attended grade school . The summer-school kids had just begun to arrive , some holding the hands of their mothers , grandmothers , or aunts . He passed the mural painting of successful black folks , Frederick Douglass and George Washington Carver and the like , that covered an entire wall . They 'd had pictures up of folks like them in just about every classroom Lorenzo had ever been in , but the pictures had n't stopped him or anyone he knew from going down to the corner . Lorenzo realized that people meant well , but still . At Warder , the wide north-south street that paralleled Georgia Avenue , Lorenzo cut left , then hung another left on the east side of the school and went down Princeton Place , where his grandmother still lived in the house in which he 'd been raised . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lakeisha , came toward him on the sidewalk , swinging a clear book bag by its strap . Right behind her was her mom , a pretty young hairdresser named Rayne . Rayne was a single mother who undoubtedly led a stressful life but seemed devoted to Lakeisha and always kept herself looking good . She and her daughter lived beside his grandmother , in the next row house to the south . Lorenzo stopped to let Lakeisha bend down and pet his dog . She had a pretty smile , like her mother 's but near toothless , and cornrows with tiny seashells fitted on the ends of her braids . " Jazz Man 's her name ? " said Lakeisha . " Jasmine , " said Lorenzo , looking at her fondly , barely knowing her but loving her , as she reminded him of his baby girl . " Is she good ? " " Most of the time . " Lakeisha touched a finger to her chest . " Does she love people in her heart ? " " Yeah , she loves people . ' Specially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man , " said Lakeisha , abruptly standing and going up the hill toward her school . " Thank you , Lorenzo , " said Rayne , smiling shyly . " For what ? " " For being so nice to my baby . " " Ai n't no thing , " said Lorenzo , smiling back , puffing his chest up a little and laughing at himself for doing so . Wondering how she knew his name , remembering that he had made it a point to find out hers from his grandmother . Maybe she had done the same . " I better catch up to her , " said Rayne . " See you around , " said Lorenzo . Down the street a bit , Lorenzo entered a pedestrian passageway between the school playground and a neighborhood park surrounded by a fence but accessible through an always open gate , and walked onto a field covered in high grass . This was the usual morning route for Lorenzo and his dog . Jasmine stopped in the middle of the field , put herself back on her hindquarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slightly embarrassed , as he always would be , at what he was about to do . He retrieved the plastic bag from his pocket , slipped his hand inside it , formed a glove , then reached down and picked up Jasmine 's feces . He turned the bag inside out and tied it off . He and Jasmine left the park , exiting by the south-side steps , and went back down Otis the way they 'd come . Passing 6th again , he could see Nigel , now standing outside his car , talking to the ones on his payroll . Nigel had on a nice powder blue Sean John warm-up suit , with a simple gold chain hung outside the jacket . One of the young men , wearing an Oakland Raiders cap sectioned like a pizza pie in alternating black and white , turned and looked at Lorenzo , made a comment to the tall boy next to him , and laughed . Lorenzo could only imagine what had been said as they looked at him , a square in a uniform , working for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shit in one hand and the leash of a dog , and not even a fighting dog at that , in the other . Time was , Lorenzo Brown would have laughed at the sight of his self too . Nigel Johnson said something to the young man who had made the comment , and the young man 's smile vanished . Nigel nodded at Lorenzo with an uptick of his chin . Even from this distance , Lorenzo could still see the boy in Nigel 's eyes . He nodded back and went on his way . LORENZO LEFT FOOD and water for Jasmine , turned the standup fan so that it blew directly on her carpet bed , and exited the house . He got into his Pontiac and went down to Georgia , where he drove north , toward the office . There he would clock in , check his messages , and take one of the white trucks out for his calls . Up around 9th and Upshur , in Petworth , he stopped to pay Rodel , the man who cut his hair in the shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 'd been light at the time of his last shape-up , and Rodel had let him slide . Coming out of the barbershop , he saw a big man with a dog , a muscular tan boxer , out on the sidewalk . The man , broad of shoulder and back , his hair lightly salted with gray , was turning the key to his business , had that sign with the magnifying glass over its front window . That sign was always lit up at night . Man had been in business there Lorenzo 's whole life . You 'd be driving down Georgia at night , from a party or a club , or from laying up with a girl , and you 'd see that sign ? You knew you were close to home . Lorenzo had heard the man coached kids ' football too , held practices on the field of Roosevelt High . Joe Carver 's boy was in the program . Joe had told him this man was all right . " Pretty animal , " said Lorenzo to the man 's back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty , " said the man , turning his head , checking out Lorenzo in his uniform . The man pushed on the door of his business . " Well , let me get on in here and do some work . " " I heard that , " said Lorenzo . " I got to be off to work my own self . " " Have a good one , " said the man , the boxer following him inside . Off to work , thought Lorenzo as he got behind the wheel of his car . Feeling a kind of pride as he turned the key . ( Continues ... )
