<p> Art Roldan <p> Title : CEO <p> Company : SecurePipe provides an outsourced managed network security service for small to midsize companies <p> Passion : Knowledge <p> Art Roldan ca n't resist the thrill of being an entrepreneur . After building a small consulting business , Roldan was hired by IBM and quickly found himself on Big Blue 's fast track . But five years later , upon spotting " a need I thought IBM missed , " Roldan joined four other ex-IBMers to create Professional Computer Resources , which quickly exploded into a $70 million consulting powerhouse . <p> Roldan decided it was time to launch a more leisurely " lifestyle " business so he could work at a moderately less frenetic pace . Yet even there his seemingly insatiable drive for success resulted in the creation of a significant tech company , which was sold to Whitman-Hart in 1996 . <p> With four lucrative enterprises behind him , he joined Madison , Wis. - based network security provider SecurePipe as CEO in 2002 . He moved the sales , marketing and corporate functions to Chicago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2002 . <p> One might think Roldan would consider early retirement . Yet for him , business is thrilling and he shows no signs of slowing down . <p> " This is what gives me the rush . I feel younger with every company I join . It 's great . It 's great . And it just keeps you going . " <p> Q. Where are you from ? <p> A. I 'm a native Chicagoan and grew up around what is now University of Illinois at Chicago . I was actually one of the last people to go to Northwestern 's undergraduate school of business before they closed it down . I went at night , but I could n't keep up with the coursework , so I wound up having to take my last year and graduate from DePaul . <p> I started my own consulting business helping companies implement IBM 's mid-range computer systems . Three years later IBM hired me in Chicago as one of their first professionals . Back then a lot of people thought IBM stood for " I 've been moved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then San Diego and finally the Bay Area , all in a span of about five years . <p> I progressed rather nicely and was on what they refer to as the " fast track . " After five years I was responsible for launching IBM 's software products on a regional level . But I always had the entrepreneurial itch . <p> Q. Why did you leave ? <p> A. I saw a need I thought IBM missed . I reconnected with four other IBMers back here in the Chicago area who had the same vision . We founded a start-up called Professional Computer Resources to develop a set of application software products for mid-range manufacturing and distribution companies . <p> We bootstrapped the growth of the company and in about five years took it to about a $25 million run rate with about 125 people and international operations . At a certain point , we realized we could n't fuel the growth organically anymore and got funding from Boston venture capital firm Greylock . <p> We were soon approached by Pansophic , a publicly held software company that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came knocking on our door three times , and the third time we agreed to merge . It was a great transaction for the investors , our management and our people , because in about 18 months we took the run rate to over $70 million . <p> Q. What was your next venture ? <p> A. Right as I was about to move back to California , the former CIO of General Instruments , who was a customer of ours , came to me with an idea to create a knowledge-based system to accelerate the time it takes to select software . <p> It seemed like a very novel idea , and since he was out in the Bay Area , I moved to La Jolla to start a virtual company called Expert Buying Systems . By the time we sold it to Whitman-Hart in 1996 , over 800 companies were using the technology and we had great relationships with all of the software vendors and all of the major trade periodicals . What was supposed to be a lifestyle company turned out to be a real business . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A. A lifestyle business is one in which you do n't have to spend 24 hours of the day worrying about your business , people , customers . In effect , you can come and go as you please . But success brings a lot of demands on your time . And if you 're going to be successful , you have to really address customer needs , have a very , very high level of customer service and bring people on board . <p> Q. Why did you move back to Chicago ? <p> A. I decided I absolutely had to move back to the Chicago area because of family roots , culture , etc . My wife and I had a surprise with the birth of our third child . Living in the La Jolla area , we realized we just did n't want them growing up in that culture . My other two kids were grounded and raised here in the Midwest . So we moved back here . <p> Q. How did you get involved with Novarra ? <p> A. In 1999 , I was introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take Web-based applications and dynamically deliver them wirelessly to handheld devices . This was before there were browsers . The venture capital firm agreed to put a seed investment in if I would come on and run the company , <p> So we founded a company called Novarra , and in eight months we had to raise $30 million , get up to 65 people , bring in a whole development organization , develop a product and bring it to market . High risk  --  but we were able to do it . One of the partners that entered into an agreement with us was Palm . At the time they were looking at a Web browser for their wireless handheld devices , and they standardized on Novarra . <p> Eventually the company shifted and began really working on telecom , which was not an area of my expertise . So I made the decision to move on to SecurePipe in 2002 . <p> Q. What does SecurePipe do ? <p> A. SecurePipe provides outsourced managed network security for small and mid-size companies . Networks are susceptible because they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unless you have the proper technology , processes and people caring for that security , you 're vulnerable . <p> Large corporations can afford to make the investment in that technology , those security policies and procedures and the people . But for small to mid-size companies , it is almost cost-prohibitive . Instead , they put up poor security processes to protect their networks even though they are still vulnerable to the same type of attacks as large companies . Those types of companies outsource the care and feeding of their security to us for a monthly fee . <p> Q. What was the first thing you did when you joined SecurePipe in 2002 ? <p> A. I looked at surrounding myself with a good team , because you ca n't do it all by yourself . To me , you 've got to have an A-team , even if you 're a small player in a market or a start-up . You have to strive to get A-players . <p> If you get an A-player who has an entrepreneurial mindset and perhaps prior start-up experience , they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their max point and then replace them . <p> Q. How much of the operation is still in Madison , Wis. , and how much down here ? <p> A. I was n't about to move to Madison , but I wanted to make sure we could keep the network operations center there because there 's a great and cheaper talent pool there for us to attract . But I also believed we could bring sales , marketing and corporate functions to Chicago and build it from here . There is a great technologist talent pool in Madison , but the real skill set for sales and marketing is here in the Chicago area . <p> I came on board at the end of April of 2002 and we 've doubled the business every year . So it 's working . <p> Q. What is your most important advice for budding entrepreneurs ? <p> A. My first piece of advice is to make sure you really understand your customer 's requirements  --  or better yet , make sure that your product has evolved as a result of your working with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service is really addressing customer requirements . <p> Second , it takes the same amount of time to build a business whether you 're in a small market or a large market , so why not pick a large market . I mean there is nothing wrong with serving an addressable market that 's small and having fun doing that . But if you have dreams or desires of making a big , big company , then make sure you 're going after a large addressable market . <p> The third thing is recognize your strengths and weaknesses and make sure you complement those with either a good set of advisers or a good management team . <p> Q. After you accomplish what you want with SecurePipe , do you plan to build another company or relax and pursue a hobby ? <p> A. You know , when I looked at SecurePipe , I thought this would be my last deal and then I 'd hang it up . But I do n't think so . <p> This really is my hobby because I 'm always learning and I 'm working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stretch my mind to really understand different markets , different technologies . As a result , I always feel like I 'm fresh with what 's really going on within the technology world . This is what gives me the rush . I feel younger with every company I join . It 's great . It 's great . And it just keeps you going . <p> Dave Lundy is president of Aileron Communications , a Chicago-based strategic communications firm .
