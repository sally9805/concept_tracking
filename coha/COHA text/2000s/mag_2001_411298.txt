Section : Money &; Investing Equities <p> The classic capitulation  --  when just about everyone has given up on stocks , making way for a rebound  --  does n't always happen . So forget about looking for the bottom . You wo n't know it occurred until long afterward . Find other ways to do some smart investing . <p> Amid all the hammerings investors have endured since early 2000 , the market plunge after September 's terrorist attacks would seem to qualify as a bottom . The Dow Jones industrial average fell 7.1% Monday , Sept. 17 , the day the market reopened , and doubled the loss by that Friday , posting its worst weekly performance since the Great Depression . In the two weeks following , the market regained a good chunk of the post-tragedy losses . <p> Trouble is , no one ever knows until much later when the market has reached its nadir . False bottoms and bear market rallies have trapped investors since time immemorial . The worst seemed to be over last April when a rally got under way ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to want to put the bad times to rest . Only when you realize how vast the uncertainty is can you deal with making the right investment choices . <p> Well , what have true bottoms looked like in the past ? The classical answer is they 're marked by what 's known in market parlance as " capitulation . " Textbook capitulation happens when investors , shell-shocked from losses , work themselves into an abrupt , indiscriminate selling frenzy . Volume soars and declining stocks overwhelm advancers . Once the market has wrung out all the Johnny-come-latelies who had pushed stocks to lofty heights , the thinking goes , only serious buyers remain . And so the path is cleared for a new bull market . <p> " I ca n't tell you how thankful I am to have missed each of the so-called rallies the past two years , " says Hugh Johnson , chief investment officer at First Albany . " The week of Sept. 17 looks to me like capitulation . But I 've been wrong before . " <p> Yes  --  at first blush , Sept. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its 684-point drop on record volume as four New York Stock Exchange issues declined for every advance . James Stack , president of InvesTech Research , sees another sign that many investors are giving up : Margin debt at last count had fallen by close to half from its $278 billion peak in March 2000 . <p> " It is n't just the Bass family liquidating , " says Stack , referring to the Texas clan that recently sold $2 billion in Walt Disney stock , apparently to meet margin calls . " Just as margin debt runups are typical of market bubbles , sharp drops are typical of capitulation . " <p> As painful as capitulations are , their redeeming value is the promise they supposedly hold out that a rebound will make everything all right . The 23% Black Monday drop in 1987 left a divot that was quickly filled in . By mid-1989 it was as if nothing had gone wrong . <p> While all this sounds nice and neat , it is n't . As First Albany 's Johnson says : " There are no road signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " Here 's why uncertainty is the only guiding principle  --  and what to do about that troubling reality : <p> Capitulations do n't occur in every market cycle . Of the ten bear markets since World War II , eight ended in a whimper , with the market steadily trending lower and no selling crescendo , says Lisa Kammert , U.S. equity market analyst at Birinyi Associates . Finally a bull market sets in . The 1990-91 market slump fits that pattern . <p> And bull markets are n't a guarantee even when there is a capitulation . Following a two-day , 25% selloff in October 1929 , the market seemed to recover and then spent another three years falling apart all over again . It took a quarter-century to recover lost ground . A similarly frustrating thing took place in the 1970s . A cathartic selloff in 1974 was followed by a quick recovery and then years of blah performance . <p> The seers are blind . If someone wants to play Nostradamus , listen politely and flee . Economists have failed to call a single recession in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Business Economists survey found them at their most optimistic in a decade , predicting clear sailing for at least three years . Eight months later a recession arrived . <p> Investing pros fare no better . The annual return on the S &P; 500 was well outside where the vast majority of Wall Street forecasters predicted it would be in each of the past five years , according to Fisher Investments . <p> Investors must wrestle with internal demons to time the market right . We are by nature momentum investors . We try to prepare for the future by extrapolating from the present , says Jeffrey Heisler , a Boston University professor who specializes in the impact of individual behavior on markets . <p> " People operate with small-sample bias , looking at pop-up windows of the past year even when 70 years of data are available , " he says . " We base investing decisions on whatever 's most vivid . " <p> A price decline does not in itself make a good value . If a rebate offer lets you get a $33,000 sedan for only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But discounted stocks are n't necessarily a bargain . Nor does the fact that they were higher before make them particularly likely to go up now . <p> The S &P; 500 , at 1071 , is down 31% from its high in March 2000 . The market is n't necessarily down because sellers are willing to unload at bargain prices . It could be down because prospects for profits in coming years are n't as good as they were and buyers were overpricing it before . <p> Even now the S &P; 500 is trading at 28 times trailing earnings , almost double the historic norm . Stock market capitalization peaked at 170% of annual gross domestic product and has slipped to about 110% since , but that is still double the historic norm . Stocks are also still trading for six to seven times book value , versus one times book at the troughs in 1974 and 1982 . <p> So it seems air still needs to be let out of some prices . The chart , " Random Rise on Wall Street " , displays the earnings yield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 years . The yield is near a postwar low and hardly attractive . <p> On the positive side , the calendar suggests we 're due for a turnaround . The bear market that began for the Dow in January 2000 is now the third longest since World War II . Only the 1,111-day bear market of 1946-49 was appreciably longer than the current 654-day one ; the 1973-74 bear market lasted 694 days . In fact , by the time the media fills with warnings of recession , as it has in recent weeks , the worst has usually passed , says InvesTech 's Stack . <p> Despite all , you can take advantage of a bear market . You do n't have to be a market seer to take losses . Just have some plan for selling losers and reinvesting immediately in comparable , but not identical , stocks or funds . The tax collector will share your pain . <p> If you end up with a $50,000 capital loss , only $3,000 of it can be used annually to offset salary and interest income , but the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward to offset capital gains in your other holdings two , three or ten years hence . <p> " It always hurts to realize losses , but taking them now is like putting them in a bank for withdrawal when you need them , " says John Roberts , director of wealth management at Denver Investment Advisors . <p> Without trying to pick a bottom , you can profit by buying and holding for a long time . Do n't put much stock in short-term speculations . Buy stocks with a 20-year investing horizon , and have realistic expectations for them . Vanguard founder John Bogle suggests 8% a year as a reasonable return . <p> Frederick Taylor , chief investment officer of U.S. Trust , recommends travel-related firms like Walt Disney ( theme parks ) and American Express , which have taken hits recently but remain sound long-term bets . " These companies will survive difficult times and prosper in better ones , " he says . <p> Also in the value basement is Mack-Cali Realty .
