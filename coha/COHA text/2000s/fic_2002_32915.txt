Grace Sherman stared down at the legal form that would start the divorce proceedings . She sat in the attorney 's office with Maryellen , her oldest daughter , who 'd come with her to offer support . Grace reminded herself that this should be straightforward , that her decision was made . She was ready to end her marriage , ready to piece together her shattered life . To begin again ... But her hand shook as she picked up the pen . The inescapable fact was that she did n't want this-but Dan had n't left her with any other option . Five months ago , in April , her husband of almost thirty-six years had disappeared . Vanished without a trace . One day everything was perfectly normal , and the next he was gone . Apparently by choice and without a word of explanation . Even now , Grace had difficulty believing that the man she 'd lived with , the man she 'd loved , and with whom she 'd had two daughters , could do anything as cruel as this . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could accept that . She would 've found enough pride , enough generosity , to release him without bitterness . If he was that miserable in their marriage , she would 've gladly set him free to find happiness with someone else . What she could n't forgive was the misery he 'd heaped on their family 's shoulders , what he 'd done to their daughters . EspeciallyKelly . Dan had disappeared shortly after Kelly and Paul had announced that after years of trying , they were finally , excitedly , pregnant . Dan had been thrilled , and Grace too . This baby was going to be their first grandchild . They 'd waited so long . Kelly had always been close to her father and his disappearance at this critical time in her life had devastated her . She 'd pleaded with Grace to postpone the divorce proceedings , convinced that her father would return before Tyler was born . When Dan did return , he 'd have a logical reason and would explain everything to their satisfaction . He had n't come back , though , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , questions , and a churning , deepening anger that intensified in the endless weeks that followed . When Grace could n't stand not knowing any longer , she 'd hired Roy McAfee , a private detective and former policeman she trusted . Roy had done an extensive search , certain that Dan had left a paper trail , and he 'd been right . What Roy had uncovered was a complete shock to Grace . A year earlier , Dan had purchased a travel trailer , paying cash for it . Grace had no idea where he 'd gotten that kind of money , nor did she know anything about the trailer . He 'd never mentioned it , nor had she seen it . To this day she had no idea where he 'd kept it all those months . Or where it was now . Given the mounting evidence , she had her suspicions . Grace believed that Dan had used the travel trailer to sneak away with another woman . There 'd been one sighting of him and it had come late in May . It almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if he was taunting her , challenging her to find him . That day had been a low point for Grace . A co-worker of Dan 's had spotted him at the marina and hurried to the library to fetch her . But by the time Grace reached the marina , Dan was gone . A woman had pulled up to the curb and Dan had climbed into the vehicle and driven away , never to be seen or heard from again . In retrospect , she 'd come to believe that Dan was providing her with the answers she so desperately needed . She could think of no other reason he would mysteriously arrive at the busiest place in town , where he was most likely to be seen-and recognized . The library where she worked was less than two blocks away . Clearly , her husband lacked the courage to tell her there was someone else . Instead he 'd chosen another , crueler way to inform her ; he 'd humiliated her in front of the entire community . Grace knew without being told that everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter in Grace 's mind . Whatever love she still felt for Dan died that afternoon . Until then , she had n't wanted to believe there was someone else . Even when the VISA bill showed up with a hefty charge from a local jeweler , Grace had refused to accept that her husband was involved with another woman . Dan just was n't the kind of man who would be unfaithful to her . She 'd trusted him . Not anymore . " Are you okay , Mom ? " Maryellen asked , touching her arm . Grace 's hand tightened around the pen . " Fine , " she snapped , instantly regretting her tone . She had n't meant to sound so sharp . Her daughter looked away . Grace focused on the divorce papers , hesitated a moment longer and then with haste signed her name . " I 'll see that this is filed immediately , " Mark Spellman said . Grace relaxed , leaning back in her chair . This was all there was to it ? You could end a thirty-five-year marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yes . Since you have n't heard from Daniel in five months , I do n't foresee any legal complications . The divorce should be final in a few weeks . " Almost four decades tossed out the window like so much garbage . The good years , the bad years , the lean ones , the years they 'd scrimped and saved . Like all couples , they 'd had their share of problems , but despite everything they 'd held their marriage together . Until now , until this- " Mom ? " Maryellen whispered . Grace nodded abruptly , surprised at the emotion that choked her . She 'd shed all the tears she intended to . In the months since Dan 's disappearance , Grace had deeply grieved the loss of her marriage and the man she thought she knew . The truth of it was , she no longer had a choice ; divorce had become inevitable . It was essential that she protect her financial interests . According to the attorney , she could n't afford the luxury of doing nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealt with that , but the emotional impact had left her badly shaken . Despite her resolve , the grief had n't diminished . And the humiliation of what Dan had done was with her constantly . Everyone in town was aware of her circumstances and the fact that her husband had walked out on her . Slowly , Grace set the pen aside . " I 'll wait to hear from you , then , " she said to her attorney , rising out of the chair . Maryellen stood with her . The attorney , a young man closer to Maryellen 's age than her own , escorted them to the office door . He began to say something , then merely looked down and murmured a brief goodbye . Outside his small home office , the sky had turned a depressing leaden gray . Grace felt a burden of sadness settle over her ; she 'd known this appointment was n't going to be easy , but she had n't expected it to exact such a toll on her self-confidence .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
