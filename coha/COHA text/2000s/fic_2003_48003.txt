I WAKE UP TO THE SOFT padding of an enormous sphinx at the foot of my bed . Its hide shimmers in the thin half-light of the ward , like an ebony idol . Its face is long and elegant , the eyelids carved heavy and deep , sleepy like Violet Dugan in The Flowered Thundermug . She 's a carnal creature of inscrutable lusts , but somehow familiar . She parts her bee-stung lips and says , " alfrEd bester is alive aNd well and living in winTERset , iowa . " Then she coughs , turns her preposterous head on its side , heaves twice , her shoulders flexing in discomfort , rolling purple and green hair over savage muscles . Eventually she spits up a ball of fur . <p> It 's a sticky mess . There 'll be no sorting it out . I look back up at the sphinx , wanting to talk to it , but the sphinx is gone . I do n't know where she 's gone , but she 's definitely no longer at the end of my bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm old , falling apart . And I signed up for neural implants as soon as Eldertech was offered for just that reason , because I hoped it would return me to normalcy . It 's very important to me to seem normal . But it does n't help that I see things that most likely do n't exist . The implants helped at first , but as my health deteriorated , they 've only intensified many of my fantasies and hallucinations . For instance , I am convinced , frequently , that I am being pursued by three men who come to me in different combinations , with different names . Historical figures , friends from my youth , and even people I 've never seen before . None of it is to be trusted . Nurse Dubedat explains that the nanotech is still so new , the implants in my head so alien , that it may be my mind 's attempt to sort things out . Confusion is , of course , a normal part of senility . " You 're doing better than many men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort . But the thought does inspire me to check my messages , to see if perhaps my sphinx is an electronic courier . Neither rain nor snow nor addled brain .... Eyes left , center , and left again . At least I remember that . I seem to have spasms of lucidity . I wait for the icon , like nurse Dubedat instructed , and when it appears , I hold my eyes on it until it opens . 5,271,009 MESSAGES As I 've had so few messages , except for advertisements , I 'm shocked . After a few moments , the titles of the first thirty or so float before me like the ghosts of road signs . I read : <p> I open the first message . I 'm in the gray room . It 's used for their therapy programs . They jack you in , and your eyes guide you through their exercises . Sometimes it 's Nurse Dubedat 's voice guiding me , other times I just follow the Eldertech icons . Sometimes I sit in the gray room for what feels like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I feel .... <p> I open my eyes and I see in a sienna suit and skinny tie . <p> The man reaches forward , but somehow ca n't reach me . I look at my own hand , gnarled , riddled with age , spotted like it was stained by spilled coffee . Next the man speaks . He says , " Mr. Buchanan , my name is Israel Lennox . Can you speak ? Can you tell me where you are ? " I cough . I strain my vocal chords , and in a reedy voice say , " No . " Lennox smiles . " You 're disoriented . It 'll take a while for you to adjust , and you can expect some rather severe and vivid ... episodes . " I look around . The gray room remains the gray room . Lennox remains Lennox . In the corner is a goon , someone impatient with Lennox . He 's tall , mop-headed , and currently examining his patent leather shoes . A government man ; a civil servant . Lennox says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will help you orient yourself in the present . We should have anywhere from five to fifteen minutes for the interview . " " Interview ? " I whisper . " I 'll explain in a bit . First , can you tell me your full name ? " " Stuart Buchanan . " " Good . Your age ? " " Eighty-eight , I believe . " " Eighty ? Oh . That 's okay , Mr. Buchanan . A few lapses are bound to appear . We have you as ninety-four years old . " " What ? " " We 'll return to that .... " I do n't want to return to it . I want to talk about it now . " I 'm ninety-four years old ? ! What year is this ? " " Mr. Buchanan , please . We 're on a strict time budget . We 've managed to stem an acute swelling of your cerebral cortex , and stimulated your memory and speech centers , but we need to ask you some more questions while we still can . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am I ? I 'm in the gray room , Lennox is in a chair , the goon is behind him , and I 'm ... where ? " Please , Mr. Buchanan . Everything will be explained during the interview , if we have the time . Please , if you would just go to your eye icon . It will help you , and us , to understand . " I go to the eye . I look away quickly , then back . A 2-D image assembles in front of me . I minimize it and move it off to the left of Lennox . He asks , " Who is this , please ? " " It 's me , in 1959 , during basic training in the U.S. Army . It was the beginning of two awful years . " " How were they awful ? " " It was when I learned , or maybe gave up on ... why are you asking me that ? " " It 's not important . Not yet . Please scroll to the next image . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My nineteen-year-old face dissolves but nothing replaces it . " What 's wrong ? " I ask . " Nothing . Much of your network has degenerated since its installation , some of it past usable levels . We 've established a make-shift substitute , tying into the old workings , but there will be delays . " The goon snorts behind Lennox . Lennox shoots him a look . " This is my colleague , Henry Hassel . He 's anxious for results . " " What results ? " And then an image of Sima appears in place of the army I.D . It 's her last passport photo , taken just before the trip to England , while she was pregnant , before the accident . She thought she looked drugged in the picture . " That 's your wife , Sima Buchanan , nee Morgan , is n't it ? " Lennox asks . " Yes . " " What year ? " " 2005 , I think . " " December , " 04 , " Lennox corrects . " ' 04 . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . " " And she was forty-one ? " " Yes . What 's your point ? " " No point , Buchanan . I 'm just testing the new networks . We 've got a lot of ground to cover , and I want to be sure you 're up for it . Can you identify the next image , please ? " Already I know it 's going to be Jemmy . Lennox 's weasly eyes narrow . He 's trying to guess what I 'm thinking , gauge if he 's going too fast , if he ought to try a different direction . Maybe he can tell I 'm getting annoyed , that he 's keeping too much from me . I decide to just ask . " This is about Jemmy , right ? Who are you , and why do you need me ? " Lennox 's eyebrows shoot up . Hassel sidles up behind him and sighs . Lennox casts a perturbed look over his shoulder , still in charge , though when he looks back at me his expression softens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's about your daughter . We believe she is in serious danger . " " So what ? She 's been in danger ever since she started working for you guys . What are you , CIA ? " Lennox looks surprised again . " We 're not exactly with the government , Mr. Buchanan . At least , not in the way you 'd think . I know that you and your daughter have not been on speaking terms for some time , but .... " " Damn right . She dumped me in this place . A veteran 's hospital . Is there anything worse ? You come in here telling me that I 'm ninety-four years old and that my daughter 's in danger . You better start explaining , or I 'm logging off . " " Mr. Buchanan . Please . You ca n't log off . You do n't understand the situation , your position . Things have changed since you were truly lucid . Do you even follow current events ? Are you aware of the current chaos in our government ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's allowing us to communicate right now was developed by Jemmy and her husband . The whole Eldertech program grows out of their research . Many of the Eldertech recipients , such as yourself , are storing ... er , strategically significant data . Peter was working with us before he disappeared , as was Jemmy , transferring intelligence . So you see , we 're up against a strict timetable . We 've got to find Jemmy while we still can . If we still can . " " Look , Lennox . I do n't have a clue who you are , or whether anything you 're telling me is true . Probably not . But if you know anything about me and my daughter , then you 'd know that coming to me is a waste of time . " Lennox smiles . " No , Mr. Buchanan . We know quite a bit about you and your daughter , and that 's precisely why we came to you . You will be able , with our help , to locate Jemmy quickly . After all , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messages ? " " Indeed . Mr. Buchanan , look : if we have the time I 'll explain everything I can , but I 've got to ask you a few questions first . Please , I want you to tell me about Alfred Bester <p> " Where you going , Mister ? " In the front seat is a tough-looking kid , maybe seventeen , or a little older , his T-shirt sleeves rolled up to reveal freckled biceps . There 's a cigarette in his thin and curling lips . His red hair is greased into a fierce pompadour . Next to him is a girl who looks all of twelve . It 's hot in the car , even for November , but she wears a brown and orange plaid jacket . Her hair is greasy and obscures half her face . She does n't look back at me . I look around . We 're on a paved highway , the sun is high . I roll my eyes , looking for icons , and find nothing . I feel ... I feel great . Completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " the kid says again . " Where you going ? " His voice is high , like Mickey Rooney convincing his cronies to put on a show . " I 'm not going anywhere , " I say . " Where 's Lennox ? What happened ? " " Lennox ? I do n't know any Lennox . " " The questioning man . Brown coat , small neck . " " Look , Mister , you got in my car . Do you need a ride or not ? " The kid snaps his eyes between the road and the rearview mirror . He shifts his weight , sitting up to appear taller . I do n't know if I need a ride . I do n't know what I 'm doing here or how I got here . It must be some aspect of the gray room , but it feels real enough . Times have changed so much ; I 'm not sure if I 'd even know the difference between hallucinating and virtual reality . Perhaps what I 'm experiencing is virtual senility ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Where are we ? " The kid relaxes a little . He says , " You tell me , old man . We 're outside some small town in Iowa . Wintertime , or something . You were just standing on the side of the road . You lost ? " An odd moment passes . What was I doing ? Was I wandering away from the hospital in a state of dementia ? How 'd I even get out the door ? What should I tell the kid ? Should I ask him to take me back ? " I 'm ... I 'm looking for my daughter , Jemmy Marko . " " Marko , " the kid says , considering , " that name is familiar . " " Really ? It 's an odd name , one you do n't hear too often . Her husband 's name is Peter . " The kid 's face falls . " Peter Marko ? The Pi-guy ? I should a killed that son-of-a .... " The girl 's head jerks toward the kid . " Jimmy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the wheel and cocks it over his left shoulder , like he means to backhand her . " I told you not to say my name ! " It 's quiet . No one says a word . The kid glares at the girl . Finally he says , " Just sit there . Do n't say a thing ! Pretend you 're not here . Pretend you 're not even a person . You 're a robot , or something . And take off that stupid jacket , it must be 98 degrees freaking Fahrenheit . " The girl makes a whimpering noise , brushes the hair from her eyes , always looking down . Then , defiantly , she reaches over and snaps on the radio . The radio crackles and then an announcer 's voice erupts from the speaker . " ... goes out to Vice President Nixon , standing in for Ike in the hospital . The Russians may have the Sputniks , but we have Great Balls of Fire ! " Then Jerry Lee Lewis starts to growl . The kid turns off the radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment he 's up and twisting around , aiming a sawed-off shotgun in my face . He says , " Make a wish , " and then he pulls the trigger . I open my eyes in the gray room . A fat pasty man sits in front of me frowning . " There you are , Buchanan . We lost you for a minute , " he says . " Who are you ? " " Dr. Lennox , remember ? Think back . We were talking , but there was interference in our connection . " " But you 're not Lennox . I remember . " He 's so different . This man looks more like the man identified by Lennox as Henry Hassel . I look over the fat man 's shoulder , but this time there 's no one else in the gray room . " I 'm sorry , Mr. Buchanan , but your memory has become extremely corrupted . I 'm doing my best to help you , but .... " " Wait a minute , " I say . " Who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right ? " " Mr. Buchanan , stay calm . I think it may be possible that you are , in the words of your daughter , skipping files . You remember that we 're looking for your daughter , right ? " I nod . " Good . This is part of the process . It 's how we want you to help us look . But you 've got to concentrate . I need you to stay with me for as long as you can . I 'm running as many searches in your databases as I can , but you 're overloaded with the messages Jemma sent you . Many of them are encoded in what is almost crude basic programming . We 've hacked into DefenseNet , but all we can get from them in terms of I.D . is " 1957 . ' " I look at this Lennox . He 's sweating . His upper lip shimmers and he wipes it with a meaty paw . A roll of fat under his chin nearly covers his collar and the knot of his tie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quick blink . I look down . The icons are all back , but at the far right there 's a new one . Lennox begins talking again . " Tell me about yourself , Mr. Buchanan . What kind of man are you ? " " What kind of man ? " I ask . " What 's that got to do with anything ? " " A lot . You must be with us . It helps if you 're focused . Talking . " I think about this some , wondering if I 'm in any position to do anything else . I reach out a hand and try to touch Lennox , but he 's somehow just out of reach . I look at the new icon , and looking at it say , " I 'm the kind of man who dies alone . The kind of man who specializes in mistakes . " Then I open the icon . <p> There are times when my heart races for no reason . Or for no reason I can identify . There may be someone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly I 'm filled with apprehension . But it 's been this way for years . I 've always considered it a part of getting old . I attribute it to stray memories . Maybe something , a scent or a flash of light , that reminds me of Sima , or how it felt when the police told me I could n't see her broken body . And times before that . Like when I was a kid hitchhiking my way to New York for a science fiction convention and the first car pulled over . Or how I felt when I was waiting for Jemmy to be born . That 's what I attribute it to , anyway . There are also times that go on for just a moment , and when I look up a day has passed . I receive certain medications . Paranol , for instance . There are times when Nurse Dubedat brings in the meds , says , " It 's good to see you this morning , " leaves , then walks in a moment later . She 'll say , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'll say , " but you just said that ! " And she 'll say , " Mr. Buchanan , " and purse her lips and roll her eyes , " I have n't been in since yesterday . " Then she 'll tell me how much better I 'm doing . Now my heart races though I 'm not thinking of anything in particular . My eyes sting and the familiar smell of tobacco , long absent from my world , surrounds me , hugs me , makes me warm and comfortable . I sit down in the arms of the cloud . There 's a general din , glasses clanking , laughter , voices rumbling , and above it all , the nasal percussion of a man 's voice , with a Brooklyn accent , reading . The voice is familiar , like a recording I 've heard before . I turn my head toward it , and through smoke , through other heads craning to see , I catch a glimpse of Solon Aquila , the beat poet . " HimmelHerrGottSeiDank ! " he yells . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by God . The Weltmann type , nicht wahr ? My ideal : Goethe . Tout le monde . God damn . " I squint , trying to figure this scene out . It 's him , all right . Solon Aquila . Even though I know he 's been dead since the late " 90 's . But what 's stranger is that he 's young , like in the early photos of him in New York with Odysseus Gaul . Around the time Gaul wrote On the Road . From the corner of the room comes the mad sound of bongos banging erratically . A waitress with a brown tray bumps my table and says , " What 'll it be ? " She 's tall , and wearing what looks like a one-piece cat suit . She has amber hair that falls in cascading curls around her face . Her eyes are heavy-lidded , like Galatea Galante , the film star from the fifties . I do n't know what to say . I look down , up again , back down , thinking about icons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm in a bar somewhere . After a moment she says , " Come on , old man , you want a Ballantine or what ? " I say , " Lennox ? " She says , " You can call me whatever you want as long as you order something . " <p> " I 'm looking for my daughter , " I say quickly . " Her name is Jemmy Marko . " The waitress 's eyes bug out . " Jemmy Marko ? ! JEMMY MARKO ? ! " She pulls a chair out from the other side of my table , and steps up on it . Then she climbs up onto the table above me . I do n't know what to do . I stand up , step back . Heads swivel as she mounts the table and extends her arms . She 's up on her toe-tips , throwing her head back like she 's a diver on the cliffs of Brazil . She yells , " You will see something new ! After Drink One and Drink Two ! " Then she bends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me from the table . I hardly have time to reach up to her , or to duck , when two strange little creatures dash out from under the table and catch her . They look like miniature clowns with blue fright wigs . Their faces are taut and old , with skin like antique paper . They set the waitress on the ground and proceed to tear the bar apart , first knocking over my table and chairs , then flinging bottles and cans of beer at people 's heads . They move so fast it 's hard to keep your eyes on them , bouncing from table to chair to bar to floor to stage , queer participants in some kind of savage video game . Solon Aquila , still on the stage , yells , " I 've seen the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness .... " Drink One and Drink Two run full tilt from the stage toward me , and they are screaming as they do so . <p> A police officer pushes his way in through the front door , calling for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People are ducking behind the overturned tables , and running for any available exit . Glasses and windows shatter . Then Drink One knocks me over , and Drink Two kicks me on the side of the head . It 's dark . I 'm afraid that something serious has happened to me . I ca n't feel my hands or my feet , or I can , but they feel infinite , like they extend for miles . I ca n't move my head . I look down , and there are the icons again . An odd row of symbols , hovering against a black field . Some are familiar , most are new . I look at one and then another , but nothing is happening , none of them open . Still , I 'm thinking , I 'm remembering , and that at least is something . It 's time , I think , to look at facts , at what I think I know . I know that I am old , perhaps older than I 'd thought . I know that I 'm infirm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I am connected to something like an Internet ; possibly , though , something military in nature . There are people who may be guiding me through programs , virtual realities , absurd scenes that do n't make a lot of sense . When I ask about my daughter , I get violent reactions . I know that I am in pain . My head is throbbing , on fire where the little clown kicked me . My chest is also burning , but at some kind of remove . It feels like mild heartburn , around the area where that boy , James , James Vandeleur , the infamous serial killer , pointed his shotgun . And I am hearing voices . Pieces of a conversation . " Establishing link , " " Nothing substantial , " " Few hours , " " The nanotech , " " Isolate degenerate matter , " " Creative hyper links , " " Buchanan , " " Bester , " " Should n't be this hard , " " Coming on line , we should have .... " These words cut across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a radio . Now I want to stay in the darkness . Now I do n't want to see the faces connected to those voices . Now I do n't want to be a puppet any longer . I look at the envelope icon , look away , then stare at it hard . Nothing . I do it again , and then again . The messages , I think . I 've got to get to them , open them . But there are so many . I look away from the icon , and back again . I will it to open . If it does , it does so gently , and I feel as though I 'm falling asleep , the voices receding , the darkness swallowing me like a great whale . Here is a familiar scene , a reunion , of sorts . There 's the four of us sitting around a table .... For years after I got out of the army , and , in fact , before I went in , I wanted to write science fiction . Once , in 1957 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to New York for a convention . I wanted to meet the Guests of Honor , Alfred Bester and Cyril Kornbluth . Bester did n't show . But it was there that I met Lela Machan , Nathan Riley , and George Hamner . They edited a small fan magazine from their shared apartment in Edgewater , New Jersey , and somehow I 'd become one of their subscribers after reading an ad in the back of one of the pulps . They seemed so glamorous when I first met them because they were all in their early twenties . I 'd fostered hopes they would publish a story of mine , though when I finally sat with them , as I would many times , around some anonymous kitchen table or a booth in a bar , they tore my work apart . In fact only one of us would ever have anything printed professionally , and that was Lela . One of her historical romances about Ben Hur . " I ... I thought you were all dead , " I say , looking at each of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dead ? We 're still right here , Stuart . What 's dead is the plot to this new story of yours . Dead and decomposing . " " What plot ? " I ask . " This story , alfreD bester Is aliVe and well and livING in wINterset , iowa . " I stare at Nathan , unsure what to say to him , unsure if it really is him . It sure looks like him . It sure sounds like him . " It 's a sticky mess , " Nathan says . " There may be no sorting it out . " I start to object , but George Hamner , his bald head gleaming , says , " He 's right , you know , Stuart . It 's all wacky . " Lela says , " Let me help . " She grabs a stapled manuscript out of George 's hand . " Okay , you 've got some kind of tech-interface with the human brain , and you 're looking for your daughter , I mean , your character , Jonathan 's daughter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of messages , " George adds . " About Alfred Bester ! You know , I finally did meet him . It was in Ireland , of all places , in 1978 , at the writer 's conference . " " Really ? " asks Nathan . " I do n't think I ever got to see him . And even if I did , I probably would n't have been able to say anything to him . I would have just stood there in awe . " " You guys , we 're talking about Stuart , or at least his story , " says Lela . Then she turns back to me . " We can talk about what Bester represents in the story later . Right now , let 's just hit the plot . " " Well , it 's just nutty , " says George . " He 's supposed to be , what , ninety-something years old ? " " You know what would help ? " says Nathan . " If we just stopped and threw this story out . " The three of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's expense . " No , really , Stu , maybe you ought to have the main character , the " you " character , want to die . Maybe he 's real sick . Maybe his daughter is sending him some kind of virus . A sort of mercy killing online ? Pretty good , huh ? " " No , no , " Lela says . " I like the state intrigue . I like it that you do n't know who these people are who are after the daughter . You 've never had a great deal of respect for government , have you , Stu ? " " No , " says George . " That 's what 's wrong with the story . Nathan 's right . It should be simple . Between the father and the daughter . " Lela shakes her head . Her red hair shivers on her shoulders . " But it 's the trouble that the daughter is in that gives the story its interest , its gravity , do n't you think ? I mean , he 's trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last time . " " Well , why does n't he just interface and follow the tracks of the sphinx ? " " That 's what he 's trying to do , right , Stu ? There 're complications . He 's sort of stuck in a loop of 1957 , right ? " " Yes . " George now looks at me , with his nose wrinkled , like he 'd smelled something foul . It 's the look he gives bad movies . " What 's with the 1957 stuff ? " " Well it 's us , right ? " asks Nathan . " 1957 is the year we met . It is the BESTER virus , after all . " " Who said anything about a Bester-virus ? " I ask . " Oh , God save us all from Alfred Bester , " George says . " I still ca n't believe that pompous ass pulled the disappearing act on us . " Nathan clears his throat . We can all tell that he 's about to deliver his ten best science fiction writers speech . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's problem was that he was enamored with the patriarchal ideal of power-hungry capitalists . You , of all people , Stuart , should be sensitive to that , what with Sima 's political bent . " " Sima ! " George yells . " Now we 're on to it . You know , Stuart , if I did n't know this was all B.S. , I 'd think you were writing your autobiography . " He waves his hands at me , letting me know that he 's got a point , not to interrupt just yet . " You really ought to write about her . That 's where your feelings are , where the guts are . It 's what 's missing from the story . Conflict . Emotion . Passion . You need to bring in your dead wife . " " What ? " " Your dead wife , Stuart . That 's what this is all about , is n't it ? Not really the daughter . I mean the " you " character , what 's his name ? Jonathan Strapp in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he needs his Sima , his dead wife . " " What are you talking about ?

They sound just like them , look just like them , know things about me that they ought to know , but what , exactly , is going on ? Why are they here ? I feel like I keep falling asleep and waking up in different dreams . " This really is n't like you , Stuart , " George says . " Not like me ? Why ? " " Well , look . I mean , this could be a very successful story . There are so many of these around today . They 're very popular . " " What do you mean , " these stories ' ? " " Alternate histories .

Did n't you tell me that he was on a bus you took the last bit of the way into New York ? When you first met us ? He was on his way from San Francisco or something . " I 'm thinking about this when Nathan starts up again . Just like Nathan . Once he gets started , he does n't like to stop . " And did n't Dr. Seuss put out Cat in the Hat in 1957 ?

" Lela says , " I 'm not so sure . " " Sure you 're sure , " Nathan says . He likes feeling right , or like he even has a point , it happens so rarely . " It 'll be like a self-help article . Dealing with grief . Photograph <p> " In a representative democracy , an ideal , you , the individual , manipulate the government , right ? But here , the government manipulates you . So , the government manipulates you , government precedes culture , culture elaborates technology , and technology created us we you them together .

Grief has its component of anger . Were n't you angry ? " " Sure , I was angry . But mostly for Jemmy . " " Oh , come on . Even you have some access to your own feelings , Stuart . You were n't angry with me for leaving you alone with a one-and-a-half-year-old child ? " " Of course . She kept saying " Mommie . " What was I supposed to tell her ?

" She 's quiet for a moment , but her image haunts me , pulls at my heart . I 'm at an emotional carnival . Old friends , whole experiences on parade . Do I bring them up , or are they ordered , part of a program meant to ferret out information ? Is Lennox leading this , sitting beside my bed , drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with places , dates , events ? Are they examining this Bester virus , or just letting the information run its course , hoping it will lead them to Jemmy ? Did they , perhaps , give me this virus ? Is it a virus ? Or some new version of interrogation ? One where you question yourself ? But here is Sima . Exactly the same as she was , as she is , in my memory . I feel now like I have n't felt in years . In pain , alive , sorry for myself . Her dark hair falls over her right eye and she brushes it away . She looks exactly the same . Like her passport picture . " Stuart , look around you . Where are we now ? " " I think ... I ... we 're in some kind of laboratory . A high-tech virtual space . I do n't know . " " You 're in a satellite , Stuart . What are you doing in a satellite ? " I do n't know what to say . " How did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tell me how I died . " " You were crushed , under a satellite that crashed into our kitchen roof . " " You were n't home , were you ? " " No . " " And Jemmy was with you ? " " Yes . " " Stuart , you could n't know this , I could n't tell you before now , but the emergency crews arrived before the accident . I saw them parked across the street . Do you know why they were there ? " " No idea . " " Because of OBO . You were n't allowed into the crash site for two weeks , right ? You never saw the body . " " That 's right . " " That was OBO . The crash was because of OBO . " " Who ? " " OBO . Orbiting Biological Observatory . A satellite . But not just a satellite . A sentient entity . OBO . Developed in the early seventies , launched in " 73 , under the same umbrella funding Jemmy worked for much later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told you it was accidental , that the orbit of the satellite that fell had decayed in an erratic fashion , much sooner that expected . But it was OBO 's doing . What happened immediately after the crash was information retrieval ; nanotech , experimental intelligence . OBO wanted me . He ... he had a crush on me . " " What ? " " He had a crush . " " Had a crush ? " " Yes . He had fallen madly in love . OBO has connections . He can control flight patterns . " " This is ridiculous ! Lennox ? Are you still here ? " I look around me . Dash past Sima , or the image of Sima , to the end of the tubular room , and look out ... the window ? Below me is the Earth , the crest of atmosphere glowing like a halo . " Lennox ! " Sima sighs , " You 're still the same , Stuart . You know that ? I should have seen it when I married you . What are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , for God 's sake . " Alfred Bester is Alive and Well , " right ? Do you think we have n't been involved ? That we have n't been watching Jemmy and Peter ? Guiding them , correcting them ? Do you think I would n't take an interest in my family and my government ? " " This is silly ! " " No , this is you refusing to look at the truth . The truth , Stuart . You 're still concerned with normalcy , with what 's possible in your little world . Well , that is something that 's changed in you since you were a child . What if you 're able to make wishes again , Stuart ? What if they could come true ? " " Okay . This is n't silly , it 's insane . " I look down at the floor , at something closer to me . They 're back . Icons . <p> Where is home ? What does that even mean ? Am I at home in the Veterans " Hospital ? Is Nurse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've lost . Home . I 'm afraid to open my eyes now . Afraid of who I 'll see , or where I 'll end up . Afraid of more questions , and no answers that make any sense . At least now , I can be with only myself , at least for the moment . It feels like an hour since I saw Sima 's face . Since the hallucination/projection of the satellite laboratory . I want this absurd journey to finally end . I want to know what 's going on . Again , I open my eyes . Before me , in the gray room , Jemmy sits in the chair once occupied by Lennox . Her head is down , her brown/blond hair is disheveled . It looks stringy and unwashed . She seems defeated , exhausted . I reach out to her , but again , like Lennox , she is just out of reach , somehow in front of me , but beyond me . She is dressed in a white jumpsuit , the kind of thing you might give a patient , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jemmy . " Her head comes up slowly , hair covering parts of her face , her eyes , but it is her , it is Jemmy . So where are they ? Where are Lennox , and Hassel ? The intelligence armies ? The dogs at the gates ? How did I find Jemmy ? Why is she in the gray room ? Jemmy looks at me and says , " Oh my God . " A tear runs down her cheek , and she begins wringing her hands in her lap . I say , " Jemmy . " " I ca n't believe he did it . He really did it . " Something snaps behind Jemmy 's blurred eyes , like an idea has just occurred to her . She sits up straight , alert now , wiping the tears from her cheek and sniffing . There 's the familiar air of defiance that I remember . " What 's your name ? " she says . " It 's me , your father . " " Say your name ! " " Jemmy , we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn it ! " " Stuart Buchanan , your father . All right ? It 's me . " She stares at me , then looks away , biting her lip . After a minute she 's scrutinizing me again . " Am I in ? Am I back on ? " Her eyes dart back and forth , they close , look down and up , down and up again . " I 'm on . I 'm on . How did you get in here ? " " Jemmy , " I say . She does n't talk . Now she 's moving her arms , eyes still darting . Something happens to the gray room . It shifts subtly , does n't seem to be a room any longer . Jemmy is starting to stand up . She 's trying to leave . But I do n't let her go . I hold her in our crucible . I move to dislocate her from her reality , will her to stay with me . " Jemmy , I 've been looking for you . " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found me . " The room settles back into its formal gray cube . " Jemmy , talk to me . I 'm your father , for God 's sake . " " You 're not my father . At least , not anymore . You do n't even know , do you ? " " Know what ? Jemmy , talk to me . " She shakes her head , mutters , " Steve . " She waves her arms frantically , punching at the air . " I wo n't let you go , Jemmy . " She closes her eyes , puts her hands in her lap , and balls them into fists . " Jemmy . " She opens her eyes . This time she raises her right hand slowly , deliberately , determined to try new processes , new escape routes . I do n't think this matters , and somehow , it does n't . " Jemmy , let me help you . " She moves her hand to her temple , rubs it as though to soothe an aching head . She sighs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's not even a name . No one 's named " Jemmy . " It 's a password . Just like " Stuart Buchanan . " It 's my connection to you . " " Jemmy , I do n't know what you mean . " She shrinks back down . Back into the resigned Jemmy I saw when I first opened my eyes . " Think , " she says . " Think about who you are . " " Who I am ? I 'm Stuart Buchanan . " " That 's not your name . It 's the name of a furniture store ! Not a person . No . My dad is not Stuart Buchanan . I 'll tell you who he is . He 's a crotchety old prick of a man , who alienated my mother a year before she died of breast cancer ; a man who handed me over to his wife 's sister because he was too much of a selfish bastard to make concessions . " Jesus . I spent years of my life trying to impress you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first place ? Because of you and your private fantasy world of discoveries and popular science . I thought if you read about me in your magazines , you might want to know me . " And where are you now ? Stuck in a nursing home in Iowa . Feeble-minded and incontinent . You do n't know what day it is , and you do n't know your name . " " Jemmy . My name is Stuart Buchanan . You are Jemmy Marko , my daughter . " The tear is back on Jemmy 's cheek . She wipes it away . " You are not my father . You 're a virus . A computer virus , all right ? You do n't even ... damn it ! I do n't have time for this . " " I wo n't let you go , Jemmy . I 've found you . It 's what Lennox said I 'm to do . But I wanted to see you for myself , not just for Lennox . They said you were in trouble . They needed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are a lot of people looking for me . But Steven must have known , he must have sent you to my father . " " Jemmy , what do you mean by calling me a virus ? " She sighs again . " Like I said , " Jemmy " is a password . It 's my password . My husband 's was " Peter Marko . ' " " Peter Marko ? The Pi-Man ? " " Yes . He designed the Bester virus . You . " " Bester ? " She looks at me again . I 'm suddenly self-conscious . I must look a wreck . An old man , returning to his daughter after years of neglect . " Will you let me run a survey ? " she says . " Do what you want , " I say . " But you ca n't jaunt off-line . I only just found you , I ca n't let you go . " " Jaunt off-line , " she says , and purses her lips . " You talk like Steven . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forefinger . It looks like sign-language . " Oh , God , " she says . " You have to let me out . Dad ... Stuart , how long have you been running ? " " What do you mean ? " " I mean I ca n't find the install ... you ca n't have been running since ... Stuart ! Tell me who killed Peter Marko ? " I flash on the getaway car , on the angry kid and his weird robotic partner . " James Vandaleur , " I say . Jemmy 's mumbling to herself . " Who 's Vandaleur ? Where 's the date ... where 's the connection ? " " Jemmy , " I say , " I 'm not here to hurt you . I want to help . I know I 've been an awful father . I was never there for you . But I 'm here for you now . Talk to me . Tell me what I should do . " " Listen to me . You are not real . You are a virtual intelligence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short story by Alfred Bester . Stuart Buchanan was a child who could make his own wishes come true . " " Do I look like a little kid ? " " That 's just it . You 're mutated . Adapted to your host . You 're activated by opening messages in a host body , creating networks . That body is organic . My dad 's body . But the network is virtual . Steven did most of the delivery development . " " Steven ? " " My husband . " Peter Marko . " The virus is administered with codes and string passages that make reference to the work of Alfred Bester . " She 's paranoid , raving , creating stories to substitute for a painful past . But why should n't she be paranoid ? People are after her . I 'm after her . And this crazy conversation is no stranger than meeting her mother on a satellite . I want to shock her into a recognition of her delusion , to show her , somehow , that I am really her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A failed man , perhaps . Maybe even failing still , but a real person . " Tell me more , " I say . " Steven created you as a kind of radical insurgence . I did n't think he 'd ever set you loose , but he did . Things are worse . He must have sent you to my father just before they picked him up . Just before .... " " Jemmy , where are you now ? " " Underground . No connections , no interfacing ... at least until just now . I do n't know how it 's happened . And you ! Look at these port interfaces . There are thousands ... you 've been talking to satellites , crossing borders , skipping files . These connections are listed as Steven 's character names . They 're your I.D . ' s . " " What do you mean ? " " When you interface , you sequester the sites as names from Alfred Bester stories . Things like " Odysseus Gaul , " or " Lela Machan . ' " " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're saying that my memories , my consciousness , is some kind of a weapon ? " " No . Well ... sort of . Steven and I work for the Defense Department . You were meant to be chaotic , mutable , and adaptive . You grew in relation to each interface . It 's fractal engineering . Steven 's specialty , not mine . " " Jemmy , this is ridiculous . I 'm a person . I 've lived a life . I remember it . I 'm a normal man with an extraordinary daughter . Look , when you and Peter came to me with the chance to reconnect with life through the VA and the Eldertech programming , I jumped at it . I 'm still a senile mess , but without these connections , I would n't even know your name . " " Where do you think that money came from ? The millions of dollars to install nanotech in the infirm and elderly ? The Defense Department ! That 's our biggest contract . And why do you think the Defense Department would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're not marginal ! We 're baby-boomers . We have all the money ! We want quality lives and quality deaths . I 'm a little bit older than that group , born in 1940 , but it 's what makes the world go around . " " You 're not completely real , Stuart . Dad . Please . You 've got to let me go . I know enough now to get away , if you 'll let me . Steven knew you 'd come for me . I think he may have sent you as a messenger . Think of it , Dad . You 've been so disappointed in life , wanting to be a writer and failing . Failing as a father . I 'm sorry , but it 's true . Use the parts of you that you took from my Dad , and think about what you 've done . Think of what you are now . About what you could be . Stuart Buchanan , a kid who could wish for things , and make them come true . A computer connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mental exercise I 'm entertaining as I look down into , up from , across a room in a veteran 's hospital . There is my old emaciated body , with a wrist-band that has a nondescript Mid-Western name printed on it , the back of the head with a number of mechanisms emerging from the scalp . Around the bed are machines , nurses , and doctors . Also , a man I think of as Israel Lennox , though which one is Lennox changes from time to time . Lennox is thanking me now for helping his organization , such as it is , locate Jemmy Marko . I make the old mouth say , " I did n't help you . " But here is the exercise , the question brought to me by my sphinx . Suppose , as my daughter Jemmy said , I am the Word made Flesh , a manifestation of programming combined with biology . Is it , in effect , any different from having been a character in a story that could wish for anything and have it come true ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than anything to be a real person , with normal problems and a normal family . That would certainly mean facing disappointment and failure . Perhaps now , on the other side , my wish would be to return to childhood , to remain forever enchanted , full of possibilities . And I would chase away my pursuers and set them on some eternal treadmill , a path to nowhere . Often , I think I might choose to only exist between covers , only in the minds of readers , of real people , people with humor and grace and convictions . All of whom are disappointed and stuck . All of whom are human . alfreD bester is Alive aNd well and livinG in wintERset , iowa . It 's all such a sticky mess . Sidebar LIKE THIS : " Sidebar An Interview with My Dead Wife By Jonathan Strapp I have n't seen Sima in twenty-eight years , if I am , in fact , ninety-four years old . She died in the summer of 2006 , two years after the birth of our daughter , Jemmy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she was forty-one when we were married . It 's funny , but when she was pregnant , I always thought it was irresponsible of me to have a child at my age . But the looks we got were invigorating . They made me feel strong and young , like I was seventeen . That 's something when you 're in your sixties . And besides , whose business was it , anyway ? I had thought that by the time Jemmy was a teenager , I 'd be gone . But a freak accident took Sima from us in a moment . She was there , and then she was n't . And then it was just Jemmy and me . I 'm afraid I was n't the best single father . I panicked . I did n't know what to do . I would say that Jemmy basically raised herself . She and her Aunt and Uncle . So , Sima . The wife I met at a science fiction convention , the woman who shared so many enthusiasms with me . What she says to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Author Affiliation Bret Bertholf lives in Denver , Colorado , and works for the Tattered Cover bookstore .
