The Fear Factor <P> " Our suspicion of things around us is more toxic than any threat . It wo n't be nerve gas that destroys us  --  it will be our own fears . " AMY M. MALLOY Kodiak , Alaska <P> The galvanization of the emergency services to the anthrax threat and the raising of public awareness have increased the likelihood that we will be able to weather effectively a possible major event NATION ON THE EDGE , Oct. 22 . These alarms act in the same way a vaccine would to improve the immune system 's ability to recognize a pathogen . DAVID S. RICHARD Selinsgrove , Pa . <P> What 's the difference between a militant extremist who sends anthrax in an envelope and a nitwit prankster who sends cornstarch ? Both are terrorists , sowing fear and wreaking havoc . Their actions have malignant and far-reaching consequences . Hoaxers should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law . ALEXANDER J. WERTH Farmville , Va . <P> More psychological damage has been caused by truck-bomb scares , anthrax alarms , post office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World Trade Center and the Pentagon . More people are killed by drunk drivers than by terrorists . More people die from the flu than from anthrax . More people die in airline accidents than in hijacked planes . Get over it , you pathetic cowards , and face reality ! It 's actually quite nice here . JOHN DODDS San Francisco <P> Almost 80 years ago , T.S . Eliot described our present situation in his poem The Waste Land : " I will show you fear in a handful of dust . " EILEEN K. MEAKIN Washington <P> When one reads that a business executive who works in a skyscraper is shopping for parachutes , the " shadow of fear " is no longer merely a specter but a jolt of what reality is now . Terrorists who live in the shadows need to be brought out into the light and their identity made known to the world . Only when they have been smoked out of the dim world of religious fanaticism will our shadow of fear disappear . NICK GIANNIAS Montreal <P> Because of the threat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " unsolicited " mail . Are they kidding ? Is there any other kind ? ELEANOR M. MILLS Charlottesville , Va . <P> People who are alarmed about anthrax should not start to take antibiotics needlessly . Only a qualified doctor should make the decision to prescribe such medication . Bacteria could become resistant , which would make them much more dangerous and harder to eradicate . Developing a new antibiotic takes years and hundreds of millions of dollars . We do not want these efforts to be wasted . LINE MERRETTE Longueuil , Que . <P> Debating the Good Fight <P> It was interesting to hear the arguments of those idealists who caution the U.S. against military action against the terrorists AFGHANISTAN , Oct. 22 . Those people fail to see that there is more at stake than catching a handful of psychopaths calling themselves warriors of God . What 's at risk is the survival of the West . If we do n't want to perish , we must get a firmer grip on our civilization . That includes a relentless fight against all those who threaten it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on His Mettle
