<p> A few years ago , in a game between the Chillicothe Paints and the London Werewolves , a foul ball smashed through Umpire Max McLeary 's mask and knocked him down , as someone later recalled , like a sack of rocks . <p> " The last thing I remember , " McLeary said , " is someone hollering , ' Max is bleeding ! ' I thought , ' This can not be good , ' and out I went . " <p> An athletic trainer came flying out of his dugout to see what he could do to bring McLeary back to consciousness . The crowd went silent . The trainer ripped off the mangled mask , pulled the umpire 's right eye open and shined a small flashlight into the orb . <p> The eye that returned his gaze , so to speak , was lifeless . <p> " Oh , my God ! " the panicked trainer exclaimed . " I 've lost him ! Call 911 ! I 've never lost anyone before ! " <p> McLeary 's umpiring partner came running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hey , " he shouted to the trainer , " check the other eye ! " <p> The trainer shined his light into the other eye and , with relief , a glimmer of life stared back at him . <p> What the trainer had not known or realized in the confusion was that McLeary has only one eye ; he lost the right one in a freakish accident almost 30 years ago . In this incident , McLeary sustained a fractured nose and a second-degree concussion , and needed eight stitches . But there was a blessing in all this : his good eye was still intact . <p> Bill Francis , a historian at the baseball Hall of Fame , said his research " came up with no record of any other one-eyed umpire . " <p> McLeary , 55 , jokes about his disability , with players and managers on the field , and with others off it . <p> " Here 's a trivia question , " he said over dinner here recently . " What has three eyes and umpires ? Answer : Me and any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solidly built at 5 feet 10 inches , with a crop of short gray hair , a ruddy complexion and a smoker 's husky voice . He said he loves baseball , loves umpiring , loves the associations he makes with the players and managers and bat boys and fans in the invariably cozy confines of the minor league ballparks . And he is forever appreciative for this part of his life . <p> McLeary has been umpiring in the Frontier League , one of the good independent leagues in the country , for 9 of its 11 years , and may travel from Kalamazoo , Mich. , to Kenosha , Wis. , from Chillicothe , Ohio , to Rockford , Ill. , to cheerfully take heat  --  and give it back  --  to those on the premises who might find fault . He umpires some 70 games a summer in the 12-team league . <p> When Joe Charboneau , the former Cleveland Indians outfielder who is now the hitting coach for the Washington Wild Things in Pennsylvania , hollers from the bench , " Max , get Windex to clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Joe , get with the times ; the eye 's plastic ! " <p> McLeary grew up in Johnstown , Pa . His father , Wilson , was an official for college sports . Augie Donatelli , the longtime major league umpire , lived in the neighborhood , and McLeary , who played baseball at Ashland College in Ohio , admired Donatelli . <p> McLeary began umpiring high school games when he was 19 , then college games from the Mid-America Conference to the Big Ten . In the early 1970 's he moved up to the Class A New York-Penn League and in 1976 to the Class AA Eastern League . His future behind the plate and on the field looked bright . <p> But one afternoon during the blizzard of ' 77 , when McLeary was 29 , his life took a turn . He and his girlfriend , Patty Barhorst , and a male friend were playing in the snow . <p> " We had picked up Patty and were going to toss her in a snowdrift when the toe of the pointy shoe she was wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I was rushed to the hospital and underwent seven hours of surgery , but they could n't save the eye . " <p> He and Patty were married two years later . <p> The accident appeared to finish McLeary 's umpiring career . He and Patty started a business near their home here designing interiors for airplanes , antique automobiles and cover seats for vehicles like motorcycles . But his heart was still in baseball . <p> A materials vendor came by regularly and talked baseball with McLeary . <p> " He suggested I try to umpire again , " McLeary said . " He said , ' You owe it to yourself to try it again . ' I thought , ' But with one eye ? ' And Patty said , ' Why not ? " ' <p> And so McLeary did , in 1986 , after a 10-year absence . He was assigned to Babe Ruth League games , then high school games . He found that his depth perception was not great , but he also found he could compensate by concentrating and focusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right position for plays and pitches . " I had to outwork everybody from the get-go because I knew I had a problem , " he said . <p> McLeary impressed officials with his energy and his consistency . He was hired by more leagues , and when the Frontier League  --  which has sent players like Jason Simontacchi and Brendan Donnelly to the major leagues  --  called , McLeary went . <p> " What we look for in an umpire , " Bill Lee , commissioner of the Frontier League , said , " are three things primarily : that the umpire is good people , that he 's in proper position , and that he works hard , " Bill Lee , commissioner of the Frontier League , said . " Max fulfills all of that . And he is also great at defusing a bad situation . There 's guys screaming that he missed a call , and Max will say , ' Well , it must 've been on my bad side . ' And they begin to laugh . <p> " And , look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miss one , he 's so mad at himself , but he 'll admit it . Umpires rarely do that . Some umpires run a game like a rough policeman ; Max runs it with control , but with a human quality . He 's an amazing individual . " <p> Lyle Travis , who has umpired with McLeary in both college and Frontier League games , said McLeary is the best kind of umpire . <p> " Some guys say they 're true partners in a game , but they are n't , " Travis said . " In a tight situation they might let you twist in the wind . Not Max . " <p> Chris Osterkamp , a 23-year-old shortstop for the Frontier League 's Florence Freedom , has had McLeary as an umpire for the past six years , from La Salle High School in Cincinnati , to Northern Kentucky University , to Hamilton , Ohio . <p> " I was amazed , " Osterkamp said . " Someone calling balls and strikes , with pitches coming in at 90 miles an hour , and to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person Max is . Try walking down a street with one eye . It 's hard to keep your balance . And he 's umpiring ! And doing a really good job . He 's one of the best in our league . " <p> Umpires in the Frontier League make $100 a game . " The gratification of the job is beyond anything they can pay me , " McLeary said . Even the calluses on his palms from the nightly ritual of rubbing down 48 baseballs before a game is part of the charm for him . <p> Meanwhile , he is not about to quit his day job at Max Interior Design in Cincinnati . <p> " ' It 's still a mom-and-pop operation , with Patty and me and one seamstress , " McLeary said . " I help run it during the day , and umpire at night . It works out just fine . " <p> On a shelf beside some of the material in the shop sits a battered umpire 's mask , from that 1999 game in Chillicothe when it appeared to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a remnant of the good times he enjoys on the ball field , as well as the hazards of umpiring , regardless of the number of eyes he possesses . <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com
