<p> A glimpse of your future : <p> It 's 7 a.m. on a Monday , and you 're racing down the freeway on your way to the airport for an 8:15 flight . You usually avoid expensive rush-hour driving , but today you do n't have a choice ; you wince as the electronic tollgate deducts the $7 fare from your account , realizing that in two hours it will be half that amount . <p> Darn that early meeting in Chicago ! To get there on time , you also had to pay the peak-hour premium for your flight out of Hartsfield . Back at home , though , your spouse is saving a few bucks by waiting until 8 p.m. to run several loads of laundry , thereby avoiding the peak-hour prices for electricity and water . <p> Welcome to the world of time-of-day pricing . The concept is simple : If you want something of limited supply when everyone else wants it , it will cost you more . We 're accustomed to this in some segments of the private sector : Long-distance calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is low , and hotels are pricier at the height of tourist season . <p> Now the idea is rapidly gaining ground among providers of publicly regulated , essential services  --  from power and water to highways and airports . It 's a trend sure to raise the ire of egalitarians , and questions about the equity of allocating scarce public resources on the ability to pay alone . <p> Economists have advocated peak-period , or incentive , pricing for years as a way to induce some users to shift demand to off-peak hours , thereby squeezing the most efficiency out of existing highways , runways , power plants and water treatment facilities . Until recently , however , most of those services did n't seem scarce enough to warrant the political pain of imposing a new price regime . That may be changing , however : Late last month , as power outages were threatening the West Coast , Washington state approved Puget Sound Energy 's time-of-use pricing for electricity . Shaving usage off the peaks is expected to reduce the need for the pricey outside power purchases that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal Aviation Administration released an analysis of airport capacity that is expected be the basis for " congestion pricing " on runway usage at the busiest airports , including Hartsfield . Basing landing fees on departure time is seen as a way to ease the delays caused by the airlines ' practice of overscheduling flights at popular hours . Just last week , U.S. Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta endorsed congestion pricing for both airports and freeways in his testimony to Congress . <p> Imposing fees at the busiest times and places and giving price breaks at others is a way to " manage demand and reduce congestion , " Mineta said . " It provides improved service to transportation users , makes more efficient use of existing transportation capacity , and reduces the need for future capacity expansion . " <p> Why , all of a sudden , is there all this worry over scarce capacity ? The obvious first reason is the long boom of the 1990s , which drew hordes of new residents to the metro regions that are the hubs of our modern economy . Plentiful jobs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks making deliveries , more business and leisure airplane trips . Computer equipment and electronic consumer goods of all kinds put new demands on power plants . All the new customers , along with prolonged drought in many areas , strained water supplies . The current economic lull will take some of the edge off , but the underlying conditions remain . <p> In the past , the reflexive answer to any supply constraint was to expand . But in many instances now , expansion is impossible or unappealing . We 're more aware of impacts on quality of life and the environment , and we have laws and regulations to mitigate them . Costs are much higher in developed areas , and the sprawl pattern has spread development seemingly everywhere . <p> Scarcity becoming a fact of life <p> Many urban highways have run out of room , and even when they have n't , further widening may make them more unsafe and unpredictable . Airport expansions , when there 's room , draw resistance from neighbors afflicted with more noise and fumes and can take years and billions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> For the first time perhaps since World War II , relative scarcity is becoming a fact of life in some areas , forcing us to make smarter , more efficient use of what we have . In truth , we have scads of unused capacity at certain times . Power plants , highways , airports and water treatment plants are all built to handle peak loads . In some places , vast freeways sit all but empty after they disgorge the morning and evening rushes . When air conditioner use goes down with the sun , some power-generation units sit idle . <p> Still , pricing solutions are in no way guaranteed to go down easy with the public . When it comes to roads , in particular , we 're accustomed to our freeways being just that . Dependent as we are on car travel , few see it as fair to charge even the lowest-paid motorists extra to get to work when the boss says to be there . <p> Southern California has come up with a hybrid concept that many see as acceptable . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and on I-15 in San Diego County , motorists now have the option of paying to use express lanes to bypass congestion in the free lanes . The " high-occupancy toll , " or HOT , lane is kept congestion-free by adjusting prices upward during peak demand times . <p> When they were first introduced , critics branded them Lexus lanes , saying it was unfair to give wealthy motorists their own fast lane , said Robert W. Poole , director of transportation studies at the Los Angeles-based Reason Public Policy Institute . But Poole , a longtime advocate of congestion pricing , said research has shown that even motorists in lower-income brackets purchase the electronic tags so they can use the lanes in a crunch . <p> " That could be a single-mom schoolteacher running late , who would rather pay a $3 toll and save 15 minutes than pay a dollar-a-minute late fee at her day care , " Poole said . " To think that only wealthy people have a reason to pay for better service on an as-needed basis is just false . " <p> Concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be unfair to charge for peak-hour travel if motorists have no other alternative , such as flexible work schedules or mass transit options in the same corridor . He advocates following San Diego 's example and using toll revenues to help provide high-quality , express bus service in those same HOT lanes . <p> Of course , if lower-wage workers could afford to live near their jobs in exclusive places like Orange County , they would n't face the double whammy of a long commute and congestion pricing . One could argue that jurisdictions accepting jobs should be required at least to zone for housing commensurate with the pay scale for those jobs . <p> Inequity underlies the problem at congested airports , too , said Amitai Etzioni , a George Washington University sociologist known as the guru of the communitarian movement , which seeks to balance individual rights with social responsibilities . <p> Try to shift the peak <p> Under the current fee structure , corporate jets pay much less than commercial jets , though their presence unnecessarily clogs runways at major airports , he said . They should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to find alternative times and runways . <p> " The moral principle is there 's never enough for everybody , so you come to the question of allocation , " Etzioni said . " The fairest model is to increase prices for certain times and uses , but keep a safety net below which no one will fall . You can charge more for extra services , but everyone should have access to the base . " <p> Though from the Libertarian end of the political spectrum , Poole agrees . <p> " You have to find a way to allocate the capacity and send signals that shift the peak , " he said . " Either the market picks who gets the scarce capacity or the government picks winners and losers , and that can be political , even arbitrary . " <p> But it is government 's role to regulate markets so that those of lesser means have options besides usurous costs , or to provide subsidies , Etzioni said . <p> " Is it OK to increase the price of snow shovels during a snowstorm ? Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dollar . " <p> David Goldberg is an editorial writer for The Atlanta Constitution .
