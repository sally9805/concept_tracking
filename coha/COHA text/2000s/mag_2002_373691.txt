In a jingoistic , rabidly anti-American Eastern nation , a military coterie plans a devastating sneak attack on U.S. soil . If Martin Cruz Smith 's suspenseful , surprisingly lyrical new novel were set in Afghanistan , it would have been called September 10 . Instead we 're in Japan , the year is 1941 , and the book is December 6 ( Simon &; Schuster ; 339 pages )  --  the day before Pearl Harbor . <P> Our hero is Harry Niles , a classic noir name if ever there was one , and Harry is an antihero par excellence . The son of American missionaries , he grew up on the streets of Tokyo and now runs a hip expatriate jazz bar there ( think Rick 's Cafe in Casablanca with calligraphy ) . <P> A grifter with a gift for double-talk in two languages , Harry loves all things Japanese , but he is a white man , a gaijin , and as wartime approaches , he needs to decide where his real loyalties lie . Both sides , West and East , suspect Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enigmatic Japanese gamine , and Alice , the jaded wife of a British diplomat  --  are getting jealous of each other . Harry 's archenemy , a psychotic , bisexual samurai , is stalking him with a sword . As the clock ticks down to zero , the action speeds up , blurring into a cherry-blossom-scented , sake-drenched fever dream . <P> In novels like Gorky Park and Havana Bay , Smith has made a specialty of looking the wrong way through the gunsight , describing America 's historical enemies with a vivid sense of place that complicates what we read in history books . Here Smith 's 1940s Tokyo is so gloriously and tenderly realized , ringing with modan jazu ( modern jazz ) and the tinkling of geisha headdresses , that the reader understands the hold it has on Harry and the reason his loyalties are so tragically divided . His dilemma is the real mystery in December 6 . After all , every story , like every war , has two sides .  --  By Lev Grossman            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
