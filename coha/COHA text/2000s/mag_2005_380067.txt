Holiday gatherings can act as glue to hold families together , but some people we love may not be able to pull up a chair at the table this year  --  or maybe ever . Others are only partially present . " Ambiguous loss " is the term coined by family therapist Pauline Boss of the University of Minnesota to describe the problem of having a loved one absent but not clearly dead  --  missing in war or a natural disaster  --  or only a limited presence because of Alzheimer 's or an emotional issue . In an interview with TIME , Boss , whose new book for therapists , Loss , Trauma , and Resilience , is due in 2006 , offers ways to find strength and hope to those facing an ambiguous loss . <P> How can families with soldiers in Iraq cope with their absence during the holidays ? Their families can keep them present psychologically . Technology  --  phone calls , videos , e-mails  --  can help , as can an exchange of gifts . <P> After a death , do n't many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They may , but that 's better than not having a gathering at all . It 's fine if they want to shift where and how they celebrate , as long as the people they care about are with them  --  because it 's the human connection that heals and makes a family . <P> Can the empty chair mean different things to people in the same family ? Absolutely , especially if someone is missing and you do n't know when or if or in what shape they 're coming home . We do n't tolerate ambiguity well because our culture socializes us to solve problems and get closure . I tell family members that it 's O.K. to have different convictions about whether that person will return as they were . I urge them to be patient with each other and , even in dire circumstances , not to judge the hopeful person as weak or deluded . It 's human to nurture hope in the face of uncertainty . <P> What if a missing person 's sister wants his gifts under the tree , and his brother ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but put them in a closet to avoid upsetting her brother . <P> How do the losses of aging affect family celebrations ? In one family I saw , the grandfather always carved the turkey . One year the old man botched it badly , and the bird fell on the floor . Everyone was humiliated and wanted to cancel the next year 's dinner . " Why ca n't we carve in the kitchen , " a 12-year-old piped up , " and put the platter in front of Grandpa to serve ? " This was a pivotal moment for the family . Families resist change , but they can and must learn to find new ways of being together , especially at holiday times . These gatherings are the heart of family life . <P> What do you do , and what do you tell kids , if Grandma is demented and in a nursing home ? Move the whole party to the home . Tell the children , " Grandma may not recognize you , but she 's still your grandma , and she likes to be touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be affectionate , even if it 's only one way . These are great moments to teach children optimism in the face of difficulty . They will imitate how we cope .
