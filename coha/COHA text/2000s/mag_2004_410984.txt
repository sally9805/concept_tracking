How to gain the right amount of weight when you 're pregnant-and lose it afterward // ellyn Ward remembers the moment she realized how much she 'd changed . " We were going to pick out our Christmas tree , " says Ward , who 'd given birth to her son in October . " We videotaped it because it was Gavin 's first tree . When we played the tape , I saw what I really looked like-I was n't the same person I knew myself to be . " The weight she 'd gained carrying Gavin was n't coming off . Because she 'd been overweight when she got pregnant-five feet three inches , 170 pounds-she 'd only needed to gain 15 to 25 pounds . But she 'd put on 40 . Now , two months after having Gavin , she was 184 pounds , and it really bothered her . " I 'd been exercising off and on-running on a treadmill , lifting weights a bit-but when I found out I was pregnant , I pretty much stopped altogether , " recalls Ward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was so tired . And I felt like it was okay to eat anything . I was n't worried about gaining the weight . " Now she was . She 's not alone . Millions of moms do n't lose all the extra pounds they put on during pregnancy . For many , having a baby is a turning point-and not a positive one-in a lifelong struggle with weight . " There 's a school of thought that a woman 's risk for obesity increases with each pregnancy , " says Edith Kieffer , Ph.D. , a researcher in public and maternal health at the University of Michigan . Gaining too much during pregnancy can turn a temporary weight increase into a permanent one . In a study by Cornell University professor of nutrition Christine Olson , Ph.D. , half of 540 women weighed more a year after giving birth than before getting pregnant . A quarter were more than ten pounds heavier . Not surprisingly , most of the women were n't happy with their bodies . The consequences of putting on those pounds are more serious than not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overweight increases your risk of breast cancer , heart disease , high blood pressure , diabetes , and other ailments . And it could cause problems for your next pregnancy . Gaining for two ? What 's the healthiest weight gain during pregnancy-for the baby and the mom ? Current guidelines outline different goals depending on a woman 's weight before pregnancy : Underweight : 28 to 40 pounds Normal : 25 to 35 pounds Overweight : 15 to 25 pounds Obese : 15 pounds The guidelines ' top priority is the health of the baby , and there are potential repercussions to gaining too much or too little . Putting on too much increases the risk of gestational diabetes ( which , if not tightly controlled , can adversely affect the baby ) and of labor complications . The baby may also be very large ( more than ten pounds ) , putting him at increased risk of Type 2 diabetes . Women who gain too little weight are at risk of having a low-birthweight or preterm baby , while outright dieting-especially Atkins-style-can produce compounds in the blood called ketones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight gain affects a mom 's health , though , is n't as well researched . Some experts think the standard 35-pound upper limit is too high , that gaining this much may contribute to obesity . Never before have women been advised to put on so much weight ; prior to 1990 , when these medical guidelines were developed , doctors usually advised a gain of between 20 and 28 pounds for women who start their pregnancy at a normal body weight . A bigger problem : The guidelines are often ignored . " The range for normal-weight women-twenty-five to thirty-five pounds-looks pretty reasonable , " says Barbara Abrams , a professor of epidemiology , maternal and child health , and public health nutrition at the University of California , Berkeley . " But only about one in three women who begin pregnancy at a normal weight stay within it . It 's not that the guidelines are wrong . It 's that we ca n't follow them . " " My obstetrician did n't give me any specific weight-gain advice , " says Ellyn Ward . " He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain-be concerned with eating healthy . ' ' " She also had a routine meeting with a nurse who " went over the food groups , " but it did n't make much difference . " It was helpful advice , but I did n't follow it . I had pretty bad eating habits , and I did n't really change my lifestyle , " she says . It 's women who are already battling their weight who need the most support when they 're expecting . " In the early months of pregnancy , many women are concerned with gaining too much , " says Bonnie Berk , a nurse and the creator of Motherwell , a fitness program for pregnant and postpartum women based in Carlisle , Pennsylvania . " But as they become larger , they give up worrying about their weight and start eating indiscriminately . I see this often with women who tend to be on diets a lot . Once they 're pregnant , it 's like a license to eat . " Yet only a modest increase in calories is needed to sustain a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an extra apple and a yogurt , a turkey sandwich with lettuce and mustard on whole-wheat bread , a baked potato with a slice of cheese , or a milk shake made with low-fat ice cream . By contrast , a pint of superpremium chocolate-chip ice cream might have 700 calories . " There 's this belief that you should eat for two , " says Kieffer . But that does n't mean you need to eat twice as much as you did before . " What experts really mean is to eat better for your baby . It takes very little to add those calories to your diet , and they should come from healthy sources . Instead of having an iceberg-lettuce salad , start with dark greens like Romaine lettuce ; try walnuts rather than cheese ; substitute a slice of melon for pastry . " A fitter pregnancy One way to avoid the extra-weight-gain trap when you 're expecting is to exercise regularly . Doing so also helps labor go more smoothly , reduces the risk of gestational diabetes , lifts your spirits , and boosts energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Gynecologists ( ACOG ) has been clear that most women can maintain prepregnancy workout routines-and that healthy moms-to-be who have n't been active can start to exercise . But this advice has n't filtered down to many women-or their doctors . " A lot of expectant moms are still fearful about being active , " says Kieffer . " There are misconceptions about what 's healthy and what 's safe . " It 's fine to do almost any physical activity or sport-dancing , low-impact aerobics classes , swimming , brisk walking , jogging-at moderate intensity , as long as you do n't become exhausted , dehydrated , or very overheated . Just steer clear of sports in which you 're more likely to take a fall or otherwise get injured : soccer , basketball , hockey , gymnastics , horseback riding , skiing , and scuba diving . The more a woman knows , the easier it is to get fit and stay that way throughout the pregnancy . When Heidi Sowers of Carlisle , Pennsylvania , wanted to conceive , she started going to the gym nearly every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day , but now she added step-climbing , treadmill running , and strength training on machines . When she found out she was pregnant , she tapered her routine to walking a mile or more each evening , plus once-a-week water aerobics and yoga . " I know it 's going to be hard to take off weight after pregnancy , " said Sowers at the time . " But I think if I maintain a healthy diet and exercise , I 'll be okay . " ( And she was . Sowers weighed 170 pounds before she got pregnant and 183 when she gave birth to her son , Mason ; within a few months , her weight was 168 . ) Others become more active after the baby arrives . " I started exercising about five weeks after my second daughter was born , and I noticed a difference within a month , " says Carolyn Mastrangelo of Roseland , New Jersey , mom of Isabella , 3 , and Kate , 9 months . " The weight came off slowly but steadily after that . I ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Her eating plan was just as simple : " I was careful with what I ate , but I would n't call it dieting . I tried to do things like eat a turkey sandwich instead of the grilled cheese I was making for my older daughter . I snacked on low-fat yogurt instead of cookies . I just made it a priority to lose the weight . " The best time to shed postbaby pounds may be that first six months . In a study by epidemiologist Brenda Rooney , Ph.D. , of the Gundersen Lutheran Medical Center , in La Crosse , Wisconsin , women who did n't lose the weight after six months were more likely still to be overweight ten years later . " Six months is n't a magic point , " says Rooney . " It 's not hopeless after that , but it is a good time to take stock . Not being able to lose all the weight at the half-year mark may be an indicator that you ca n't get a grip on controlling your weight . " The hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life in many ways-none of which make it easier to take good care of yourself . Suddenly there 's little time or energy to prepare nutritious meals . You may feel isolated and stressed out . And then , perhaps , you go back to work full-time a few months later . Too often , food provides comfort . The idea of exercise can seem even tougher than eating right . You may be embarrassed about working out in public , or not ready to leave your new baby with a sitter while you hop off to the gym-not to mention that finding the time may seem impossible . Yet exercise is the single most powerful determinant of long-term weight control . According to ACOG , it 's a good idea to start exercising again four to six weeks after giving birth . ( If you 've had a c-section , though , check with your doctor first . ) Postpartum moms are more successful at keeping up regular physical activity if they have a plan and are confident they can carry it out , studies show . Make it realistic-one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think they can take off a lot quickly . When this does n't happen , they get discouraged . But if you 're overweight , losing even 5 or 10 percent of your body weight can have substantial health benefits , reducing your risk factors , like high blood pressure , for such chronic diseases as Type 2 diabetes . And you 'll feel better about your body as well . More ideas : * Line up support . Have your husband take care of the baby so you can hit the gym , for instance . And make a vow to help each other get fitter : In Olson 's study , women were more likely to exercise regularly if their partners also did so , suggesting that it helps if fitness is a family value . And it 's a good example for your child ! * Enlist fellow moms . There 's comfort in numbers . Women who work out with a friend or join an exercise class often have more success , studies show . * Bring your baby . Find a mom-and-baby exercise class , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to a video during one of her naps. * Be brisk . While any activity is good ( even pushing a stroller at a leisurely pace ) , if you can get some aerobic activity into your life-anything that gets your heart rate up-you 'll drop the pounds faster . A healthier mom One year after having her baby-and nine months after her video epiphany-Ellyn Ward is a svelte 129 pounds . She lost 55 by joining Weight Watchers . When Gavin was about 10 months old , she and a girlfriend ( who also has a baby ) joined the YMCA . Each morning at 8 A.M. sharp-rain , snow , or shine-they drive to the Y , drop off the babies in the daycare , and work out in the gym . " I was determined to do something about my weight , " says Ward , who credits her husband , Brandon , for his support . " You ca n't do this , though , until you have the mind-set to do it yourself . Other people saying that you need to lose weight is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it . " The payoff is terrific . Ward believes she 's a healthier mom for Gavin and that her body is in shape for a possible second pregnancy . Perhaps best of all , she just feels good about herself . There are no simple solutions to eating right and being active when taking care of an infant . But experts agree on one thing : A new mom ca n't put her own needs last . Women often make an effort to eat healthfully and take care of themselves while pregnant for the sake of their baby-but then return to unhealthy behavior when " only " their own health is at stake . Says Rooney , " I think the message we need to give moms is " If you can do this for your baby , why not do it for yourself ? ' ' " Sidebar THE MYTHS OF BREAST You 'll lose weight naturally . Some people think that breastfeeding will help you lose weight , so it 's not necessary to limit what you eat if you 're nursing . While it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take in more than you burn . There 's actually no link between how long a woman breastfeeds and how much she weighs . Only when you stop nursing should you diet . A strict diet is n't a good idea while you 're breastfeeding especially one that restricts whole categories of foods - but a smart eating-and-exercise plan will help you lose postbaby weight , according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists . Eat well-balanced meals with moderate portions , cut back on calorie-rich sweets and snacks , and exercise as soon as your doctor gives the go-ahead . And be patient . Sidebar WHAT 'S YOUR EXCUSE ? When you have a new baby , there are a million reasons you ca n't exercise and eat better . Here , excuses moms made-and how they got past them : " I deserve a little pleasure " I was a working mother and busy 24/7-I went back to work six months after my son was born . There 's lots of cake and candy at the office , and I felt that I deserved all of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care what I looked like-but after a while I did ! So I enrolled in Weight Watchers-I 'm down from 140 to 118 pounds . Only six more to go ! " - GRETCHEN WEBB PARENTING STAFFER , MOM OF TUCKER , 12 MONTHS I 'm wiped out " My biggest excuse : I 'm tired and busy . How I get past that is by knowing that exercise gives me energy , reduces stress , and makes me feel better about myself . " - GWENDOLYN UVARNICA SPOKANE , WA MOM OF BAILEY , 13 MONTHS I hate dieting " I made the excuse that I could eat what I craved and just exercise more the next day . I overcame this by eating smaller portions of the foods I wanted , not eliminating them . " - KIM CASEY , COLUMBUS , OH MOM OF QUINN , 4 MONTHS I 'm so hungry from nursing " I was starving all the time in the beginning . I ate lots of ice cream-and not the low-fat varieties ! But I had a big incentive to get to the gym and to watch what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my daughter was born , and I did n't want to look fat in the pics ! " - ELISSA FISHMAN , PARENTING STAFFER , MOM OF SOPHIE , 10 MONTHS It 's cold , I 'm broke ... " First , it was too cold outside , the sidewalks too icy . Second , it was n't worth exercising unless I had enough time to really work up a sweat . Third , we could n't afford a gym membership because I was n't working . Fourth , I could eat anything and everything because breastfeeding would burn off the empty calories . My solution ? I realized that every little bit counts either positively or negatively-every little bit of exercise and every little bit of candy . So I made walking dates , joined a stroller fitness class with other moms in the neighborhood , and cut out pedicures and fancy dinners to join a gym !
