<p> Gwinnett seems slow to learn from past mistakes <p> Thanks for putting the spotlight on this shopping center and others in the county that have become rundown eyesores ( " Run-down retail center now easy on the eyes . " AJC Gwinnett News , March 6 ) . I just wish our county planners would have to take into account how many empty retail spaces are already in the county when they approve plans for new space to be built . <p> Take , for instance , the intersection of Burns and Pleasant Hill roads . There is a brand new shopping center at that intersection that has empty spaces for rent . At the same time , two new shopping centers are being built , one right across the street and one right next door . Of course , none of these parking lots will be connected to each other , so traffic will have to enter and exit directly onto Pleasant Hill Road . <p> While the community improvement districts , such as the Highway 78 CID , are realizing how these types of shopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning to create service roads to direct traffic between the main road and the shopping areas , the rest of the county just does n't seem to be " learning " from past experience . <p> We have taken the main traffic corridors in Gwinnett County and turned them into never-ending " shopping malls " with traffic entering and exiting every few feet . <p> It 's too bad that requirements for traffic flow between shopping centers ca n't be mandated countywide to help cut down traffic congestion on major arteries . <p> JANET TOBIN , Lilburn <p> Why not a statewide storm water sales tax ? <p> The General Assembly 's possible legislation in 2008 to move forward with a statewide sales tax ( " New tax sought for road projects ; $22 billion promised from statewide levy , " AJC , March 1 ) for a diverse set of transportation improvements is long overdue and laudable . <p> But there is a downside to those additional roads  --  water quality . <p> Transportation projects result in hard surfaces  --  or imperviousness . Imperviousness leads to storm water runoff and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local government 's water resources , it is understood that engineering and natural solutions exist to regulate and manage water quality and quantity . Unfortunately , the cost to implement these solutions , assuming this legislation passes and thousands of miles of new roads are built , will likely be ignored without dedicated water resource funding . The cost to the environment of ignoring storm water runoff may outweigh the benefits of reduced congestion . <p> I hope our legislators will give every consideration to allocating a small percentage of a proposed statewide road sales tax money for improving water quality in the region and statewide . For every state or local elected official that bemoans the need for transportation improvements to improve our quality of life , there is an equal number that point to water quality as the driving force and life line for the states economy . <p> For decades , the state has concentrated on transportation infrastructure . The time has come for water quality to receive equal billing . <p> If statewide sales tax dollars can be collected for road projects , why not similar legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " for water-quality improvements ? It 's a small price to pay to set aside a minuscule percentage of a statewide road sales tax for a resource that plays such an important role in every one of our lives . <p> LAWRENCE KAISER , Grayson <p> Meadowcreek coach is all that a coach should be <p> The story regarding Meadowcreek High School coach Reggie Perry was great ( " Meadowcreek coach goes all out to get his players noticed , " AJC Gwinnett News , Feb. 11 ) . <p> My son just completed his senior football season at Central Gwinnett High School . <p> When he was in the eighth grade , we made a family decision to move him to Central Gwinnett out of the Collins Hill area . A lot of thought was placed in that decision . My son was a middle-of-the-road student , and at Collins Hill , middle-of-the-road students sometimes get left behind . <p> At Central High School , I was told how my son would be looked after in the classroom as well as on the field . A lot was said about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of seniors had , with all the hype about college prospects and a run at a state championship . I bought into it like a fat bass in a small pond . <p> Each time my son did not make the grades he should , as was the case with a lot of these players , the concerned parents were met with the same loving story and told what more we could do for our kids . When we asked for help from the head coach , we were told that was not his area of responsibility . It was n't until I refused to allow my son to attend spring practice that they finally started to take me seriously . By that point ( my fault ) , the grade harm was done . <p> I watch year after year as good football players get passed over because of their poor performance in the classroom . No matter how hard I preached this to my son , he missed the message . <p> You may ask if we did our part . We are not a broken family . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father in the same household . We are upper-middle-class parents with college degrees . We spent a small fortune on tutors and training for both of our kids . I keep a watchful eye on my kid and his friends . My son is a three-year varsity starter for the football team , which made the playoffs each of those three years . <p> But what does this have to do with coach Perry ? I met with coach Perry more than a month ago because my son was being recruited by Union College . I remembered that a number of coach Perry 's players from last year attended Union . I called to leave a message , and he agreed to meet with me . <p> During our first meeting , it became obvious that he and I shared the same type of upbringing and hardships . I was left feeling as if I had just made a true friend . Since that time , coach Perry has done as much or more to help get my son in school than anyone . Just a few weekends ago , coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behalf . <p> Having worked with kids myself , I can see the father figure in coach Perry that is missing in some of these other coaches who currently enjoy the success of winning . <p> At this point , if I had the opportunity to do it all over again , I would trade in every win and every telephone call from the recruiter to have my kid be a part of his program . It may be too late in the game for my son and other good kids that I learned to know and love at Central Gwinnett to experience this type of coach , role model and father figure . <p> KEYBO TAYLOR , Lawrenceville Photo : Lilburn Square Shopping Center after improvements
