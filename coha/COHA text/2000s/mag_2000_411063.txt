The hidden dangers at summer camp , the shocking lack of regulation , and what you can do to protect your kids . A GH investigation . Photograph // ON JUNE 28 , 1999 , Robert Scheinfeld dropped off his 10year-old son . Jeremy , for the start of his third summer at sleep-away camp . " He was so happy , so excited to go  --  he gave me a big thumbs-up sign , " his father remembers . " ' Dad , I 'll see ya , " he said . " Robert and his wife , Jodi , had no qualms about entrusting their son or their 8-year-old daughter , Sarah , to Camp Scatico , a 77-year-old family-run camp on the shores of Twin Lakes in Elizaville , few York . They had met there themselves years ago when they were both campers , and they were still involved with the place : Jodi was going back that summer as girls ' tennis director . Camp Scatico held a special place in their lives , and it was a place they wanted to share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a hot and sunny afternoon-Jeremy and 25 other junior campers were playing an organized game of Hounds and Hares . Lanky , brown-eyed Jeremy-his mom describes him as- " all legs " - was one of 13 boys on the hares team . At around 2:00 P.M. , the hares poked holes in bags of flour and ran behind the baseball field and into the woods-making the most of their ten-minute head start . The hounds gave chase , following the white trait of flour . Three counselors , including a lifeguard , and one counselor in training , supervised each team . To throw the other boys off their path , the hares jogged across a cornfield , around a gravel mine , and along the banks of a wide , winding creek with the ominous-sounding name of Roeliff Jansen Kill . But " the hounds were catching up , " Joshua Rosenbluth , a 10-year-old camper , later recalled . " So we all thought that maybe we could go across this creek . " Ben Klein , a 20-year-old counselor , guided them . " I stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he reported later . His feelings turned out to be an unreliable gauge of safety . When the hares got about 12 feet into the muddy , waist-deep water , they lost their footing . The current , made powerful by recent rains , swept campers and counselors 30 yards downstream . As some of the boys began slipping underwater , 16year-old counselor in training David Neistadt reached for Jeremy 's hand . No luck ; the creek had a mind of its own . Photograph // Then camper Joshua Rosenbluth saw Jeremy floundering behind him . " He was trying to keep his head above water , " Joshua recalled . The two boys grabbed hands , but when they struck a submerged log , Joshua later recalled , " I looked down at my leg and heard a branch break . When I looked back up , Jeremy was gone . " Along the southern shore of the creek , Klein , struggling to lift some of the campers onto a logjam , stopped for a moment to take a head count . Twelve . He tried again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number kept coming up the same . Twelve . Jeremy was missing . Back on the trail in the woods , the camp 's 44-year-old waterfront director , Andrew Bush , heard shouting . This was no game , he realized ; these were cries of panic and terror . He rushed to the creek and jumped in , organizing a couple of counselors into a human chain to pass the campers to shore . Other counselors ran along the water 's edge : " Jeremy ! Jeremy ! " Another dialed 911 . Soon , dozens of state troopers , firefighters from two towns , and volunteers from local rescue and emergency medical squads were swarming through the woods . Search-and-rescue dogs sniffed the ground . The scene was chaotic and horrific . Then , when Robert Scheinfeld arrived-he flew to the camp from his office in New York City to be with his wife , brother , and other family members already gathered at the scene-he threw himself into the water . " He was just so emotionally overwrought , " recalls Ed Moore , zone sergeant for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to be dragged out by rescue workers . " Even the scuba divers groping around in the muddy stream were tied to ropes anchored around nearby trees , for fear they 'd he swept away . Photograph Jodi and Robert Sheinfeld at home . Below . their son Jeremy on the pitcher 's mound . Photograph // That night , Robert rode in a police patrol car , where he stayed until dawn , hoping and praying that Jeremy had managed to pull himself up on the bank of the creek downstream . Jodi took care of Sarah . All night they waited . The next morning , divers discovered Jeremy under five feet of water , his little body jammed under a log . County investigators say several campers were almost lost in the creek that day . They have charged the camp with violations of state safety regulations , and the Scheinfelds have filed a civil action against the camp . Though counselor Silas Laycock admitted , " our mistake was going in when we could n't see the conditions , " Camp Scatico management has contested the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declined to comment on the accident to Good Housekeeping . " Jeremy was doing what he was told to do , " says Robert Scheinfeld . " He was playing a game sanctioned by the camp and supervised by counselors . He just followed his counselor . How could that happen ? Why should that be allowed to happen ? " EACH SUMMER NINE MILLION AMERICAN children go off to camp , participating in a " let kids be kids " tradition that goes back a hundred years . It is possible for them and their parents to be picky : There are 10,000 day camps , resident camps , Bible , Scouting , music , and sports camps across the United States . It 's also possible to get lots of guidance . Camp advisers make personalized recommendations , camps send out elaborate videos selling themselves , and camp fairs provide a range of options . In addition , many parents look for an ACA accreditation-the label awarded by the industry 's own American Camping Association to the 2,500 camps that have met its standards . Choosing a camp is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most parents hope the camp they 've picked will give their child more than an opportunity to sing campfire songs and eat charred hot dogs . They expect the camp to help their kids grow and learn . They expect it to keep them safe-in mind , body , and spirit . And they expect it to send them home better for the experience . But the truth is , too many children , like Jeremy , never come home . And far too many return with injuries , both physical and psychological , that could have been prevented . Torn between letting kids explore their independence and fearing what will happen when they do , parents ca n't help but wonder where camps draw the line between adventure and risk . Nobody knows for sure . Only a few statesincluding New Jersey , New York , Maine , Michigan , and California-make a serious effort to regulate camps . In many other states , the oversight does n't go beyond health codes for kitchens and swimming pools . That means near misses and even serious injuries often go unreported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're fatal . According to the association 's standards director , Pat Hammond , three campers died at camps in 1999 . Considering that camps have millions of children in their care , they do a good job , insists Rodger Popkin , who has been a member of ACA for 30 years and volunteer president since early 1999 . " I do n't know , but you may find that kids are safer at camp than at home , " Popkin says . " I just do n't think there are a lot of problems . " Here 's one : The ACA numbers are too low . A simple search of a news database reveals that at least seven campers died last summer . Will Evans , director of safety education for Markel Insurance , which covers 25 percent of the camping industry , estimates that as many as 15 campers die each year-two thirds of them in accidents , such as drownings , that might have been prevented . When asked why the ACA statistics underestimate the problem , Popkin replied , " There is absolutely no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , Markel alone has recorded more than 70 accidents involving camp vehicles and 24 reports of alleged sexual abuse . The Insurance Services Office , a company that provides liability insurance , says camps pay an average of $5 million in claims to camper ' families each year . Though many of the mishaps at ramps turn out to be minor-A.M . Skier , a Pennsylvania based insurance agency , says more than half the injuries its clients report are bruises , sprains , and strains ; 13 percent broken bones ; and 20 percent cuts-other hazards are life-threatening . These are some of the danger zones , areas where camps should he extra cautious : Careless counselors Last summer , 14year-old Brian Ault was a camper at Seven Ranges Scout Reservation in Kensington , Ohio , for the fourth time . One evening he sat in an amphitheater with 500 boys , watching a skit on scouting history . To capture their attention , a 19year-old counselor created a homemade special effect : a steel pipe filled with gunpowder , intended to set off a startling boom . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive Jack Johnson . Apparently not enough . The pipe rocketed into the ninth row , where it struck Brian in the face . Brian underwent extensive plastic surgery , which left him with a conspicuous four-inch scar . " Kids can be pretty cruel , and they tease him about it , " Brian 's father , Mike Ault , says . " he also has difficulty with his speech , trouble making some sounds . " Ault adds , " I ca n't believe they would take that kind of chance with my son . " Road trips Transporting children to off-site wilderness hikes and mountain climbing is often more dangerous than the extreme sports themselves . Last July , seven campers from the Country School camp in Millersburg , Ohio , piled into a 1991 Dodge Ram van headed for a seven-day canoeing trip in Michigan 's LInner Peninsula . To make room for passengers , they tied their gear onto a homemade rooftop luggage rack , making the van unstable . The camp owner 's 23year-old son , Ben Barker , the counselor on the trip , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so he turned the wheel over to an 18-year-old assistant , Anna Cook . Barker fell asleep in back . When a rainstorm hit , Cook lost control of the van . It rolled twice , shattering the windows . Three people , including Barker , were thrown from the van , according to paramedics on the scene . Fourteen-yearold Lindsey Franzwa was hit by an oncoming car and killed . Pam Franzwa , Lindsey 's mom , says the camp did n't inform her until 36 hours later , when she received a call from the owner . " Your daughter was taken by the highway demon , " he told her . Douglas King , attorney for the Barkers , disputes this matter . " Accidents happen when nobody 's really at fault , " King says , commenting for the camp . " It 's an unfortunate error . " " I 'm just getting over the numbness , " Franzwa says . " I pray a lot . I read a lot . I cry a lot . But I have a seven-year-old . And when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . I know Lindsey would n't want me to he a wreck . " Lack of medical/emergency help Camps are often miles away from an emergency room . Last August , at Shadybrook , a camp for special-needs children in Moodus , Connecticut , one camper was given the wrong medication ; he became ill and was flown to a hospital . State health department regulators fined the camp $5,000 and eventually revoked its state license ( putting the camp out of business ) after uncovering more cases of neglect , plus violations involving Safety , cleanliness , and supervision of counselors . An interesting fact : The ACA had withdrawn its accreditation of Shadybrook in 1998 ; unfortunately , because of A ( ; A policy , that information was never made public . Scant supervision Accidents tend to take place at mundane moments when staff members let down their guard , says attorney Walter McKee , who specializes in camp-related lawsuits . That 's what happened to one of his clients : It was during the transition period between Camp Caribou 's first and second sessions-when counselors were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflatable ball on the dining hall porch . " You 're only supposed to use it in supervised situations , with spotters , " admits William Dreary , the attorney for the Winslow , Maine , camp . The boys rolled the ball to a soccer field , 11-year-old Jeremy Massler climbed on top , and a 150-pound teenager slammed into it . Jeremy crashed to the ground . It took two operations to rebuild his shattered hip . Without admitting blame , the camp recently settled a lawsuit with the boy 's parents . Water accidents Drowning is the leading cause of death at camp , and advanced swimmers are not immune to danger . In July 1998 , when one instructor at Team Adventure Camp in Greenfield , Massachusetts , took a group of 14 campers out for a river lifesaving drill , 12-year-old Adam Dzialo slipped into the water , got his leg trapped between rocks , and nearly drowned . Though his family hopes for a recovery , he still ca n't walk or speak . THIS SUMMER MAY BE NO DIFFERENT BECAUSE LITTLE IS being done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain degree of safety through its accreditation program ( see " What Docs " ACA-Accredited " Mean ? , " page 121 ) but seems unwilling to go any further toward making the process more rigorous . The reason , ACA President Rodger Popkin claims , is that it might discourage camps from participating . " If you 're a camp , you do n't have to belong to the ACA , and you do n't have to submit to inspections at all , " Popkin says . " The dues are not inexpensive . " And , let us remember , it is those dues that keep the ACA in business . But Popkin ca n't explain why so many of the standards-say , the inspection of fire extinguishers-are voluntary . " You may be right , " he says , " that there 's a lack of precision in it . " Additionally frustrating to parents is the ACA 's policy of not sharing camps ' inspection scores or publishing a list of camps that have lost ACA accreditation-that is , the ACA knows which camps are in trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most want to know it . Popkin explains : " The results are potentially misinterpretable . " His recommendation to parents choosing a camp is to do what he did with his own son : talk to other families who have sent kids there , ask questions about the medical program . " When a parent picks a camp , " he says , " it 's an act of faith . " A-Lost parents want to rely an something more than faith when it involves their children , but that 's not the only problem : Three quarters of the nation 's 10,000 camps are n't accredited at all . " Some do n't want to pay the fees , " explains Andrew Yankowitz , a New Jersey-based camp consultant . " Others just do n't want anyone looking over their shoulders . " No wonder that some think government regulation may he the best answer . Michigan , for example , requires its 380 day and residential camps to comply with a stringent list of regulations , ranging from mandatory life jackets to criminal background checks on camp directors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least once a year-and their visits are unannounced . " We think it makes more sense this way , " Says Bill Shipp , Michigan 's program manager of camp licensing . " It 's not just a matter of last-minute preparation . You should be doing what you 're supposed to he doing all the time . " Few states practice such diligence . In Ohio , Far instance , where Pam Franzwa 's daughter was attending camp , state-imposed rules are almost nonexistent . " Our regulations are not mandatory , " says Steve Binns of the Ohio Department of Health . " Which means they 're minimal and that local health departments enforce them if they want to . Some do . Some do n't . " Franzwa , who lives in Glen Ellyn , Illinois , is planning a trip to Ohio to lobby to have the laws changed . " I had no idea about this , " she says . " When I first took Lindsey to camp , I noticed her counselors and what her bunk looked like . And I met the nurse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been looking for . There 's a lot I would ask now . " Some lawmakers have been asking questions of their own . In the 1970s and 1980s , Mitch Kurman , a Connecticut man whose son drowned in a canoeing accident while at camp , and other safety advocates pushed Congress to pass federal camp legislation , but those bills failed , in part because of opposition fron the camp industry . Recently , Congressman Chris Shays ( R-CT , ) reintroduced H.R. 266 , the Recreational Camp Safety Act . Unlike earlier efforts , Shays 's scaleddown bill would n't set safety rules , but it would require camps-for the first timeto report deaths and serious injuries to the federal government . " That 's the only way we 'll really he able to sec what the extent of the problem is , " he explains . Shays wonders why , if the government can justify regulating day-care centers to protect kids , it should n't also oversee camps-where kids are away from home for longer periods and taking part in riskier activities . " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to have the confidence that the camp is n't in the dark about safety , " he says . The congressman introduced his bill in January 1999 , but the ACA 's Popkin has n't gotten around to it yet . " I have n't studied it , " he says . " It 's very difficult for me to answer questions about a subject I do n't have detailed information on . " On a local level , state Senator Suzi Oppenheimer has introduced a bill in New York ( with input from the Scheinfelds ) calling for a camp safety advisory committee to draft a proposal for standardized counselor training , orientation programs , and testing for camp directors . Until better regulations exist , safety advocates urge parents to do their own investigating ( see " Questions You Should Ask , " page 184 ) before choosing a camp for their kids . Even as the Scheinfelds prod the camping industry to improve , they 're preparing to send their three other children-Sarah , 10 ; Daniel , 8 ; Zachary , 5-to a day camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can be sure they 've spent a lot of time talking closely with the director about their concerns . " It 's a scary thing for us to do , " Jodi Scheinfeld says , " but we still believe in the benefits of camp .

Sidebar A MOM REMEMBERS BY JODI SCHEINFELD My beloved son Jeremy , age 10 , the eldest of my four children , drowned in a river playing a game with campers and counselors on July l , 1998 . That August , my husband , Rob , and I and our three other children , Sarah , Daniel , and Zachary , retreated to the seashore for Jeremy 's birthday . Each member of the family held a bright balloon . One at a time , we snipped its string and made a wish . Daniel shouted , " I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Zachary whispered , " Please come back , Jeremy . Please come back . " Jeremy was my source of light . Whenever he bumped his way through our front door , I smiled inside to witness the wonder of my child in growing motion . So much on his mind : basketball practice ; guitar chords ; where 's Sarah , Dan , and Zach ; ca n't find my Nike hat ; how was your day , Mom ; Knicks game at 8:15 , must finish homework by then . He was 71 pounds , four foot nine and three quarter inches on May 19 , 1998 , his last checkup . A wiry , tiny-butted kid , especially in his baseball uniform ( can I mention that he pitched his last baseball game on Father 's Day ? ) , with neverclean fingernails . He wore nylon sweats , T-shirts , and high-top sneakers . I will always remember his newly chiseling cheekbones , his determined jaw , full soft lips , doe-brown eyes , and penetrating smile . When I wake up these days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him . Then I glance at the eight- by ten-inch photograph of our four children on the wall . The portrait reminds me of his terrible , silent absence . Jeremy 's three younger siblings miss their brother terribly . Daniel , who wears Jeremy 's Yankee shirt " to feel close to him , " has taped Jeremy 's photograph next to his pillow , and photographed the mounted photo to make sure he has two . Sarah looks through his extensive book collection , and sits at his desk , coloring , writing , gluing , thinking . Zach chooses toys from " Jer 's " closet and perches for play on the ladder leading to his vacant bunk bed . I sometimes allow myself to read old birthday and Mother 's Day cards . At 8 years old he wrote , Dear Mom : Happy Mother 's day ! You 've survived eight years . You 've been to the hospital 4 times . You are amazing ! You deserve a great day . Sleep until 11:00 if you want to . When the fierce need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think about his spirit and feel an obligation to go on-and carry it with me . I pray it will give me the strength to create light and provide guidance to my remaining children as our family makes its way . Sidebar WHAT DOES " ACA-ACCREDITED " MEAN ? Many camps boast that they 're accredited . And parents look for the American Camping Association symbol when they 're selecting a camp . Accredited camps pay an annual fee of $250 to $3,000 ( depending on the size of the camp ) and agree to meet certain ACA rules . But many of the standards are voluntary . What 's mandatory Sixteen standards , including having a lifeguard at a waterfront and a CPR-trained staff member , proper storage of flammable and hazardous materials , availability of emergency transportation , procedures for overnight trips , the locking and storing of guns and ammunition , certification for scuba or boating instructors , and a health history for each camper . What 's optional Screening counselors , training staff to handle emergencies , inspecting smoke detectors and fire extinguishers , health-care personnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missingperson procedures , equipment maintenance , life jackets , insurance coverage , and many others things . Camps need only comply with 80 percent of 280 regulations ( in six categories ) to receive certification . Evaluations Camps are evaluated once every three years , generally by other camp professionals . Besides being infrequent , the evaluations are scheduled far in advance , so the camp has plenty of time to prepare . Sidebar QUESTIONS YOU SHOULD ASK How are the counselors selected and trained ? Is the staff subject to a criminal background check ? ( This is a legal requirement in only a few states . ) Staff should spend at least a week in orientation each year , so they can learn safety rules and practice emergency procedures . If your kids want to try rock climbing , find out whether the instructors are certified to teach this activity . How many counselors are trained in first aid and CPR ? What 's the ratio of campers to counselors ? An 8:1 ratio is fine for day camps , though it should be lower for residential camps as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ junior staffers or counselors in training ( CITs ) are n't counted ; these younger counselors are still learning the ropes . Also , how many counselors are returning from previous summers ? A high rate may indicate a more competent staff . Is the camp insured ? It 's hard to believe , but camps do not have to carry insurance . In order to secure coverage , camps often have to meet a number of insurance-company standards that are more stringent than ACA requirements . One major insurer , for instance , checks out counselors ' driving records and prohibits risky equipment . " We look very closely at the qualifications of the people running these programs , " explains Ed Schirick , vice president of Frontier Insurance Company , which evaluates safety procedures at 350 to 400 camps . " We look at how the equipment is maintained , down to the question of whether the tires on the camp vehicles are safe . " How long has the camp been in business ? Camps that stay open for years tend to take better care of campers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always true . Is the camp ACA accredited ? If so , the camp director should be eager to discuss how many of the standards it met . If the camp is n't accredited , find out whether it follows ACA guidelines ( some camps do even if they have n't completed the formal process ) . Does the camp have a written safety plan ? Request a copy so you can review the emergency procedures and safety training . If you 're meeting with the camp 's director or nurse , take a look at the medical log from the previous year . " You 're always going to . have some bruises , scrapes , and bumps , " cautions Will Evans of Markel Insurance . " But if the log has four hundred pages of kids being treated for injuries , it 's a good bet that the camp has a supervision problem . " Who 's in charge during off-site trips ? For wilderness activities , campers should be supervised by a staffer specially trained in first aid . For long canoe outings , there should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescue . Suzan Gould , director of Camp Onas in Ottsville , Pennsylvania , suggests asking whether counselors carry cell phones for emergencies . Who drives the camp vans or buses ? Do camp officials check his or her driving record ? How old are the vehicles ? Do they make the kids wear seat belts ? Make sure the camp sends other staffers along for the ride to supervise the kids . Who will provide medical care ? At a minimum , residential camps should have a nurse on the grounds at all times , with a doctor-ideally a pediatrician-available for emergencies . If your child takes medication , make sure there 's a counselor or nurse trained to dispense it , Finally , find out how far the camp is from the nearest hospital . Sidebar SEX ABUSE Over the past three years , one insurer , Markel , has gotten 24 reports from children who claim they were sexually abused at camp . And last year , a young man from Iowa won $600,000 in damages against a camp director who had molested him . ( The camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other camper and received a ten-year prison term . ) The American Camping Association recommends that camps subject potential staff members to criminal background checks . But screening may give a false sense of security . If a counselor in his late teens has a history as a sex offender , he may have been tried in juvenile court , where records are often kept sealed . That 's why parents should ask whether a camp discourages excessive one-on-one contact between a counselor and a child unless a second counselor is present . Peter Berger , a former sex crimes prosecutor , advises parents to call their child while he 's at camp . Listen for subtle signs : " an authority figure who 's paying too much attention , " Berger suggests , " or a counselor granting special privileges , taking the child places where they 're alone . " But the real threat may be other campers . A 13-year-old and his mother have filed a lawsuit against Sherwood Forest Camp in Lesterville , Missouri , alleging that in 1998 he was beaten and sodomized by several campers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keowa in Narrowsburg , claiming their sons were similarly assaulted . Parents should ask lots of questions about supervision , making sure children are never left alone for long . // <p>
