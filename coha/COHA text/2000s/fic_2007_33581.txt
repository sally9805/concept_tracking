Shelley I 'd guess that Marinos have been burying Rivenbarks for seventy years . I ca n't compare funeral customs here in Wilmington , North Carolina , with funeral customs anywhere else , but I can tell you that Rivenbarks usually ask for the minister from First Baptist , flowers from Will Rehder , and an open bar . Sometimes they read Psalm 23 and sometimes they read Psalm 121 . It 's hard to know what they 'll request for a burial like this one , though , because there 's nothing routine about the death of a child . This afternoon , on the first really beautiful day of spring , four-year-old Oscar Rivenbark fell from the third branch of the magnolia tree in his backyard . The ambulance managed to get him to the emergency room within about fifteen minutes , but he died before the paramedics could wheel him in . My husband , Martin , and I run Marino and Sons , the biggest funeral home in the area . Between the two of us , we have over forty years of experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Outsiders probably imagine that my world is all catastrophe , but most of our cases come from heart attacks , hospice , and Brightmore , a retirement community a few miles away . It 's not like there 's a fatal car accident after every prom . I get the news of the accident fromthe police blotter , so I 'm prepared when the boy 's aunt , Gracie Rivenbark , makes the first call to our office at about five . I click open the calendar on my desktop and ask , in a voice that sounds both competent and sympathetic , " When would Tara and Mark like to come in ? " I try to get the parents involved as soon as possible . I 'm here to help them with their grieving , and grieving starts at the moment of death . Gracie says , " Hold on . " Behind her , I hear the murmur of various voices , a volley of muffled questions , silence , then a few more moments of tortured debate . Sudden death produces a kind of bafflement in people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are , their name , the year . And then , five minutes later , they can become extremely lucid . In my dealings with the bereaved , I never rush them . " Would tomorrow afternoon work ? " Gracie asks . " Around two ? " " That 's fine , " I say . This case demands particular sensitivity , not just because the boy was young , but because his parents are young as well . Even Aunt Gracie seems to be conducting this business for the first time , ever . When you bury old people , you often deal with other old people , and they 're likely to have organized a funeral before . As gently as possible , I tell her , " I 'll need them to bring in a few things when they come . " Gracie says , " A few things ? " " An outfit . Something he might have worn to church , or even something he loved to play in . " Gracie confers again with her relatives . The door to my office squeaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin , slip inside . He 's wet haired and red faced from the gym and he 's holding today 's mail . He does n't know what 's happened yet . When he looks at me , I squinch my eyes shut , then open them again , signaling , This is a bad one . I scrawl " Rivenbark-4 ys. old " on a notepad . After a lifetime in this business , Martin does n't respond to news of death in any obvious way . His flinches are microscopic : a twitch at his mouth ; an alteration in his breath ; the slow , slow blink of his eyes . Cases like this one have always been hard on him , and they seem to have gotten harder lately . I dread the thought of what 's ahead for us . " Why do you need clothes ? " Gracie asks . " Well , " I explain , " we 'll need something for the burial . " Martin sits down in the armchair , starts to go through the mail , then abandons it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monthly fails to interest him . He watches me . Martin 's fifty-four this year , twelve years older than I am . His parents and grandparents were all morticians and he started going out on retrievals in his early teens . In comparison , I 'm fairly new at it . I got my license a few years after I married him , so that 's not even twenty years . I impress Martin , though , because the sadness never really gets me down . It came as a surprise to both of us , actually , that I could marry into this business and adapt so well . How could you know , when you 're a kid , that you have the perfect personality to become a mortician ? Gracie Rivenbark says , " I 'll go through the closet this evening . " " That 'll be fine , " I tell her . " And , we 'll need a couple of pictures , too , in case the family wants to make a display for the service . " " A display , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Okay . " Her voice sounds light and wispy . I 've got to get the poor thing off the phone . I make my final point . " And Tara and Mark should feel free to bring their other children to the meeting , too . " Gracie says , " I 'll tell them . " And then , in the background , I hear sobbing . It is desperate , rhythmic , utterly bereft . I hold the phone in my hand , listening , staring into my husband 's eyes . At that moment , I forget myself . " Is that Tara ? " I whisper . Gracie says , " Yes . " Martin 's head falls back against his chair . I close my eyes . It 's been months since we have buried a child and in that time my own life has changed significantly . The sound of an anguished parent affects me more deeply now . I suppose that 's because I 'm about to become a mother myself . Martin and I have tried for years to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my chances of giving birth are about as likely as my chances of winning the U.S. Open .
