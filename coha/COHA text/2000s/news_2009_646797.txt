ARLINGTON , Va .  --  The Lockheed Martin Fighter Demonstration Center , a few subway stops from the Pentagon and a short ride across the Potomac River from Capitol Hill , feels like a high-end auto dealership . <p> It 's here that the giant defense contractor pitches its next-generation fighter plane , the F-22 Raptor . There 's a simulator , PowerPoint slides and a video , backed by a soaring musical score , in which Air Force pilots rhapsodize about the fastest , stealthiest , most advanced dogfighter ever built . <p> The center is part of an intense persuasion campaign by Lockheed that includes dozens of lobbyists working the halls of government and millions of dollars spent to target decision-makers . In recent weeks , Lockheed has taken out full-page ads in Washington newspapers and magazines proclaiming that 95,000 jobs ride on the aircraft 's fate . The company contributed $125,000 to various inaugural committees in honor of President Obama , lobbying records show . <p> It 's not hard to understand why . At $191 million apiece , the F-22 is the most expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Gates , are ready to pull the plug on it . <p> For all its capabilities , critics argue the F-22 is too costly and irrelevant to the wars of today . They note that it has n't flown a single mission in Iraq or Afghanistan . Yet , with plants or suppliers in 44 states , the program counts some of its biggest fans in Congress , which has consistently voted to support it . Taxpayers to date have bought 183 Raptors at a cost of $66 billion , including development . <p> President Obama is required by law to tell Congress by March 1 if his administration plans to buy parts to be used to build more F-22s ; in coming weeks , he 'll decide whether to phase out production or buy up to 60 more , the Pentagon 's Geoff Morrell said Wednesday . Analysts say the jet offers an early gauge of Obama ' s willingness to make tough spending decisions and take on lawmakers in his own party . <p> " This is going to be a real test of Obama ' s ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brian , executive director of the Project On Government Oversight , a longtime F-22 critic . <p> Without mentioning the Raptor , Obama promised in his address to Congress Tuesday to " reform our defense budget so that we 're not paying for Cold War-era weapons systems we do n't use . " <p> Even if Obama decides to kill the program , lawmakers may try to override him , as they have several times with previous presidents who sought to cancel weapons systems . The F-22 saga promises to be the first of many such fights , because Gates has said he wants to spend less on big-ticket conventional systems , such as aircraft carriers and artillery , that are n't tailored to so-called small wars featuring low-tech insurgencies . <p> Those weapons have congressional backers in both parties , bolstered by millions in campaign contributions and a bevy of lobbyists that include former members of Congress , former generals and former Pentagon officials , records show . <p> Lockheed and four other main F-22 contractors  --  Raytheon , Boeing , Northrop Grumman and United Technologies  --  spent $65 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Responsive Politics . Their employees made $11.3 million in political contributions to both parties in 2007 and 2008 , according to the center 's data . <p> There is also a grass-roots effort : A website , PreserveRaptorJobs.com , encourages F-22 backers to send a letter to Obama arguing that shutting down the F-22 " would have drastic consequences for our economy and national security . " And the International Association of Machinists , whose workers help construct the plane , has been vociferous about building more . <p> " The F-22 is just one example of probably a half dozen , " says Keith Ashdown of the watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense . " This is why it 's so hard to ever cut anything . Every weapons system that the administration has a bull's-eye on , there 's a fleet of lobbyists and companies organizing to stop that . Decisions to make military investments should be based on the need of the war fighter , not the politics of who benefits . " <p> Lockheed spokesman Jeffrey Adams said in an e-mail , " The corporation supports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> The company declined to say where the F-22 's supplier plants are . That data is proprietary , spokesman Sam Grizzle says . <p> Built to dominate <p> The F-22 program began in the mid-1980s as a replacement for the F-15 Eagle , the Air Force 's crown jewel that brought decades of American air dominance . The plan was to marry stealth capability , advanced engines and sophisticated electronics to establish overwhelming superiority in air-to-air combat with the Soviet Union . Originally , the Air Force envisioned 750 F-22s in its Cold War arsenal . <p> Then the Cold War ended , and development costs for the plane soared . The Air Force reduced the number of F-22s it sought to 381 . <p> But it still argued for the Raptor , especially as Russia and China built more sophisticated planes to better challenge the F-15 . The United States , the thinking goes , should never have to worry about owning the skies , wherever its forces are in combat . <p> By most accounts , the F-22 delivers . Lockheed says one Raptor can take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ratio for the F-15 , the workhorse fighter for the Air Force since the 1970s , is 3-to-1 . <p> " It 's an effective deterrent , " says Larry Lawson , Lockheed 's manager for the F-22 . " People do n't want to come out and fight it . It tamps aggression . " <p> The warplane 's radar and other sensors communicate with other Raptors and controllers on the ground , Lawson says , providing pilots with an unmatched view of approaching threats . <p> " This thing 's a flying antenna , " Lawson says . " We manage all that information for the pilot . " <p> It 's not , however , without flaws . A Congressional Research Service report in December noted several problems with the F-22 , including software issues , a 2004 crash that destroyed one jet and faulty titanium forgings in 41 planes . <p> " The airplane is proving very expensive to operate ; we 're not seeing the mission-capable rates we expected , and it 's complex to maintain , " Pentagon acquisitions chief John Young told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the technology question the need to build more F-22s . Rep. Joe Sestak , D-Pa. , of the House Armed Services Committee and a retired three-star admiral , wonders under what circumstances the U.S. would need to engage in sustained dogfights with a sophisticated air force . The last air-to-air combat by U.S. pilots were lopsided shoot downs over the former Yugoslavia from 1994 to 1999 . In 2003 , Iraq 's air force stayed on the ground . <p> Plus , the military is moving ahead with the F-35 , another expensive warplane built by Lockheed . While not as capable as the F-22 , the F-35 is more advanced than potential adversaries . <p> " You say to yourself , is this a platform in search of a mission ? " Sestak says . " If it is , how many do you need in search of that mission ? " Sestak sees no need to build more than the 183 already paid for . <p> Former Air Force secretary Mike Wynne , who championed the F-22 , says the country needs 381 to account for every contingency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar to what the British faced at Dunkirk in World War II , he says . <p> " Quantity has a quality all its own , " Wynne says . " No modern war has been won without air superiority , and the first time the American Air Force gets its ( butt ) kicked , our version of Dunkirk will be upon our Army . " <p> Many in Congress agree . Forty-four senators and 100 members of the House signed letters to Obama arguing that 183 F-22s " is insufficient to meet potential threats . " <p> Lockheed 's lobbying <p> That kind of support is no accident . As the single largest government contractor , with $35.5 billion in government revenue in 2008 , Lockheed makes sure its message is heard in Washington . <p> In addition to its staff of 36 lobbyists , Lockheed paid 41 contract lobbyists last year , records show , including former Indiana GOP senator Dan Coats , former Air Force general John Conaway and former FAA administrator Linda Daschle . Coats said he could n't comment ; Conaway and Daschle did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prime example of the revolving door between government and contractors . In a report last year , the Government Accountability Office counted 221 former senior defense officials working for the company in 2006 . Edward " Pete " Aldridge , who was Pentagon acquisitions chief when Lockheed won the F-22 contract , retired in 2003 and joined Lockheed 's board , where directors are paid a cash and stock retainer of $220,000 a year , SEC records show . None of that violated government ethics rules . <p> With F-22 suppliers or factories spread among 44 states , many members of Congress find it easy to support the program . After the economy soured , the company began placing new emphasis on the jobs argument , says defense analyst Loren Thompson , who consults for Lockheed . <p> For a lawmaker , there is little to be gained in opposing major weapons systems , he says : " The only people who really get motivated on this stuff are the people who have jobs and contracts in their districts . " <p> One lawmaker who has gone after big weapons systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought to block what government auditors said would be a more expensive multiyear contract for the program . The Senate voted to fund the deal , 70-28 . Among those voting with McCain and against Lockheed were Obama and then-senator Hillary Rodham Clinton . Those in favor ran the political gamut from liberal Democrat Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts to conservative Republican James Inhofe of Oklahoma . <p> Lockheed employees made $3.1 million in political contributions to politicians in both parties in 2007 and 2008 . But that was only part of the firm 's efforts to garner favor . The company regularly makes charitable contributions to honor influential current and former public servants , a practice disclosed only in the last year under a new lobbying law . <p> Last year , Lockheed made three charitable contributions totaling approximately $140,000 in honor of Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm . Michael Mullen , and one for $25,000 in honor of Gates , lobbying records show . <p> Morrell , Gates spokesman , says the secretary is not influenced by contributions , lobbying or advertisements . <p> " No matter how many full-page newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their expensive and elaborate campaigns do not in any way influence our procurement process , " he says . " We evaluate programs strictly on the basis of whether they help us advance our national security objectives while also providing the best value to taxpayers .
