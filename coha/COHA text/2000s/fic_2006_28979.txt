Voodoo Heart By Scott Snyder Random House Scott Snyder Voodoo Heart i . My girlfriend and I are not rich people . Not by a longshot . But together we own a mansion -- one of the last real mansions in central Florida . It was built by a family of lemon farmers back in 1869 , almost one hundred and fifty years ago . We put less than eleven hundred dollars down , hardly anything , but the house has over twenty rooms in all : five bedrooms , a library with a vaulted ceiling , a study , even a garden room that looks out on three full acres of wild backyard . The morning the realtor first showed us the place , I was sure she 'd made some kind of mistake . The other houses she 'd taken us to see had been small : one- and two-bedroom apartments mostly . And then , out of nowhere , this . For a long time , Laura and I stood on the front lawn , just staring up at the house . It had a wraparound porch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Laura had a good job at the aquarium , and I managed a major wrecking yard , but even so , how could something like this be in our price range ? " I know what you 're thinking ! " said the realtor . She had to speak loudly to be heard over the persistent buzzing from insects hidden in the foliage . " But the price is just what I said . I 'm tempted to buy this one myself . " I studied the house , trying to take in the whole giant sprawl . Granted , it wouldneed work . The place looked like it had stood vacant a long time , abandoned for ten , maybe even fifteen years . Ferns had sprouted though the slats of the porch . The columns were covered in a scaly silver mold . There were mushrooms growing in one of the rain gutters , a whole row , white with red spots , like tiny bloodstained umbrellas . The grounds were in bad shape too : everything wild and overgrown , choked by weeds and bramble . Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no disguising what lay beneath all the disrepair . With time and effort , this could be a wonderland for us . Laura must have sensed my excitement . " This house is incredible . But it 'll be way too much work . I mean , look . " She waved a hand over the tall , weedy grass , which came all the way up to our thighs . " The yard alone will take weeks to clear . " " We would n't tackle the whole thing all at once , " I said . " We could just do a little every day . " Laura turned to examine the house again . I spotted a tick crawling up the back of her shirt and quickly plucked it off before she could notice . " I do n't know , Jake , " she said . " If it 's so great , why has it been standing here , empty , year after year ? What 's wrong with it ? " " So , " I said to the realtor . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mopping the sweat from her face . Her name was Joyce . She was an older lady , a grandmotherly type ; she wore her white hair in a bun ; her sneakers were brand-new . The house had been hard to find . It lay off the main road , hidden behind the old lemon fields . Walking over from where we 'd parked had been a big exertion for Joyce . " Nothing 's wrong with this place , love , " she said . " People are just afraid of privacy , I suppose . " I waited for her to go on . " You 're sure ? There 's no catch ? " " Fess up , Joyce , " said Laura . Joyce sighed and wiped her glasses on her shorts . " Look . The only thing I can think of that might have kept people away is the camp . There 's a camp nearby . " " A camp ? Like a camp for kids ? " Laura said . " No . It 's a camp for ladies , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Like a spa ? " I was intrigued ; I 'd never been to a real spa before . I pictured myself relaxing in pits of bubbling mud . " Not exactly a spa , " said Joyce . " Not exactly how ? " Laura asked . Joyce picked a daisy from the brush and sniffed the petals . " It 's a federal retreat . " " A federal retreat like a prison ? " said Laura , sounding alarmed . " I suppose it 's sort of like that , " Joyce said . " But it 's strictly a white-collar facility . It 's not like there are any violent offenders in there or anything . This is a place for society ladies . " " A jail for them , " said Laura . " Laura , it 's not something to worry about , " said Joyce . " It 's practically a resort . " Laura turned to me . " Jacob , I do n't want to live near a prison . What if we were here and there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight for our house . " I noticed a glimmer of excitement in Joyce 's expression at hearing Laura refer to the house as " ours . " " You heard Joyce , " I said . " It 's not that kind of place . It 's for society ladies . " I made a tea-sipping gesture . " I 've heard of some very high-profile women spending time there , " Joyce said , swatting at a cloud of mosquitoes . " Remember Shirley Sayles , the famous golfer ? She bet all that money on the U.S. Open ? The one she was playing in ? She 's at the retreat right now . " " Listen to that , " I said . " Shirley Sayles . " " Maybe we should look at something else , " Laura said . " Come on . " I stepped onto the front porch , which groaned loudly . " Jacob , " said Laura . But I was already opening the front door . The inside of the house was dark and cavernous , with a fog of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the windows , their green-and-yellow leaves pressed to the glass like children 's hands . As I stepped into the parlor , I could feel the temperature dropping around me . The room was empty except for a burned-out chandelier reaching down from the high ceiling . I glanced around , examining the peeling wallpaper , the molding sculpted along the ceiling 's edge . I already knew that this was the house for us . It had stood for over a hundred years , like a fortress hidden in the woods . Nothing about it was cheap or makeshift . The beams supporting the ceiling looked like they were carved from stone . It did n't take long for the house to win Laura over , either . The touches were what got her , all the charming details : the claw-foot tub in the master bathroom , cracked but still usable . The carved lemons at the ends of the banisters . The small stained glass window in the parlor door , round as a coin . What really brought her around , though , was the garden room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor and extended out from the rest of the house , overlooking the sloping backyard . The curtains were drawn when we entered , and the room was especially dark , except for a trickle of light seeping in through the far end of the ceiling . I figured there was a crack in the roof , but when we walked over , we saw that in fact , in a certain spot , the ceiling rose and gave way to a small crystal dome . Laura 's face lit up when she saw it , the gentle swell of glass , the elegant iron webbing . The dome was filthy with soot , but when she reached up and wiped off one of the panels , a spear of sunlight pierced the room . " Romantic , " said Joyce , and then coughed from the dust . Of course , even now , six months after we moved in , we still have lots to do . If you came over to our house today , you 'd find some rooms fully furnished and others completely bare . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'd find it thoroughly decorated -- a sofa by the fireplace , a glass coffee table , the towering bookshelves lined with books . But , on the other hand , if you picked the door at the end of the second-floor hallway to open instead , you 'd find a room with nothing in it but an old electric picture of a beach hanging on the wall . When the picture is plugged in , the palm trees sway gently in the breeze , the waves sparkle and roll across the white sand . A flying fish even jumps out of the water , then slaps back down . There are a few rooms Laura and I have n't even begun yet , storage closets mostly , little side rooms with shelves built into the walls . We leave the doors to them closed for days at a time , weeks . Sometimes we 'll forget one exists altogether , until one day when we happen to notice a doorknob sticking out of the wall . Just the other morning I opened the door to a storeroom near the basement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It must have been there for months ; all that was left of the corpse was a skeleton . A winding comb of bones coiled in the dust . All the space used to make Laura nervous , the empty rooms , the dark door frames . Now and then she 'd panic and call to me from wherever she was in the house and I 'd have to come up from the cellar , or down from the study , and stay with her for a while . Recently , though , I bought a pair of walkie-talkies from a toy store , so that whenever we 're working on different rooms we can stay in contact . We 've started making up tag names for each other , like truckers . " Kitty Cat , this is Hunka Luv . What is your twenty ? Over , " I say , the plastic receiver to my mouth . " Well , hey there , Hunka Luv , " says Laura . " I am currently en route to the shower , over . " We sand , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house progresses . The old layers of wallpaper are scraped off . Little by little the floors brighten , revealing rich swirls and knots in the wood grain . The chimneys are flushed out , and suddenly a cool , sweet draft flows through every room . Our bedroom is my favorite place in the house . It sits at the top of a wide central tower , and it 's round , with shuttered windows that look out over the treetops . The ceiling is high and cone-shaped , pointy as a witch 's hat . If we forget to shut the windows at night , fruit bats fly in and hang from the rafters like little leather change purses . Laura 's almost finished with the garden room . She removed the heavy curtains . She cleaned the dome so that the glass sparkles in the sunlight . I told her I 'd cut down some of the vines lashed across the windows if she wanted me to , as they obscured the view , but she said to just leave them . " They make the room feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like it this way . " She keeps a bunch of pillows scattered around , big satin pillows with tassels on the corners , and I often wake up on weekend mornings to find her already downstairs , lying beneath the bright dome , reading the newspaper in her nightgown and sunglasses . I chase Laura up the creaking spiral staircase , laughing , both of us naked . I carry her to the windowsill , her arms around my neck , and I make love to her with the whole blue sky behind us . Then , when we 're done , I 'll sit with her while she takes a bath in the giant cauldron of our marble tub , her knees poking up through the water like tiny islands of pink sand . Sometimes I 'll read her part of a book or a magazine . Other times , while Laura soaks , I 'll amuse her by spying on the women in the prison near our home , the federal work camp . I bought a telescope from an antique store in town and set it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyepiece , it 's like I 've been transported right inside the camp among the residents . Joyce was telling the truth , too . The camp 's grounds are beautiful , with shaded walking paths and picnic tables set up beneath the many trees . There 's a pond populated by giant goldfish , a vegetable garden that the women tend in the afternoons . The facility is entirely open , too . There are n't any barbed wire fences or guard towers , just a bright green sprawl of grass and trees around which the ladies are allowed to wander freely for most of the day . The only thing bounding the property at all is a bright yellow line painted in the grass along the prison perimeter . The paint contains fluorescent chemicals , and at night the line glows an eerie , spaceship green . " What are they doing now ? " Laura said to me the other day . She was lying in the tub . I used the telescope to scan the grounds for any of Laura 's favorites . The women she most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the society wives and politicians and celebrities who 'd lived all sorts of glamorous lives before ending up at the camp . One resident was the owner of a baseball team , another was a restaurateur . There was a famous jazz drummer , the CEO of a baby food company , even a world-renowned eye surgeon . I do n't know about Laura , but sometimes I actually felt a strange surge of pride knowing that such a cluster of accomplished women was gathered so close to our home . I tried to find something interesting to report , but most of the women had headed inside the canteen for supper . A couple of them were jogging along the gravel exercise path . One , the baseball team owner , was reading the newspaper beneath a tree . It was nearly sunset and the line painted around the prison had just started to glow . " The chef , the really fat lady ? She and your favorite girl , Shirley the golf pro -- they 're fighting it out in the yard . " " Sounds exciting , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ever happened at the camp . " It 's ugly , " I said , turning back to Laura . " Shirley just pulled out a shank . Things are looking bad for the chef . " " Her ass is grass , " Laura said , smiling . She yawned and let her head fall to the side and I studied her face for a moment -- studied the soft shells of her eyelids ; her lips ; a tendril of wet , brown hair curled against her cheek . I felt a pull in my chest so hard it frightened me . " I 'm going to marry you in this house , " I said . " We can have the wedding in the yard after I clear it out . " Laura wrung the water from her hair . " Is that a proposal ? " " I guess I can do better than that , " I said . She laughed . " I should hope so . " Then she closed her eyes and let her body slide down into the water . " Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hundred days from tomorrow , you and I will have been together for five years ? I was doing the math in the car the other day . Is n't that crazy ? Five years . " I leaned over and kissed her on her forehead . " I 'll tell you what . If in a hundred days from tomorrow I have n't proposed to you , you can leave me forever . " " Jacob , that 's not what I was getting at . &; Continues ...
