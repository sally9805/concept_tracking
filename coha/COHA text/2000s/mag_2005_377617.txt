Lisa Marie Presley 's sophomore album , Now What , is due April 5 . <P> You 're rich and the daughter of a pop star . How come you did n't turn out like Nicole Richie ? My mom , myself and Scientology . With reality shows like Richie 's , it 's so easy to become a celebrity now , is n't it ? It does n't take much work . <P> It did n't take much work for you . When you made your first record , you were immediately booked on Letterman.Yeah , and my first live per-formance was on Good Morning America . I skidded through it . I had no chops yet . <P> Do you have chops now ? I have my moments . Do n't expect perfection . The way it all happened for me , perfection is n't in the cards . <P> Was this album easier to make than the first ? There was n't as much pressure . With the first one , nobody really knew me . I had to answer for myself . <P> Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't say I think about him . Usually I just have terror stomach , which I know he had . I do the deep breathing and the pacing he did . <P> How often do you go back to Graceland ? A few times a year . It 's a beautiful , sad place for me . I still have family there . We have Christmas dinner at the house . I find it my responsibility to still go there and inject some life into it . <P> Are you what your daddy would call a Hard Headed Woman ? Not at all . That 's someone who 's stubborn . I 'm rebellious . <P> Your single Dirty Laundry , a 1980s Don Henley song , is about the bloodthirsty media . Explain . I thought that song was more relevant now than ever . Our entertainment now  --  the reality-show thing  --  is about watching the demise , humiliation and darkest hour of others . <P> Have you been asked to be a witness in the Michael Jackson trial ? That 's too much of a hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't say a word , and I 'm pretty happy about that .
