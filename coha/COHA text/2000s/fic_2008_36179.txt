I am alone in the dark , turning the world around in my head as I struggle through another bout of insomnia , another white night in the great American wilderness . Upstairs , my daughter and granddaughter are asleep in their bedrooms , each one alone as well , the forty-seven-year-old Miriam , my only child , who has slept alone for the past five years , and the twenty-three-year-old Katya , Miriam 's only child , who used to sleep with a young man named Titus Small , but Titus is dead now , and Katya sleeps alone with her broken heart . <p> Bright light , then darkness . Sun pouring down from all corners of the sky , followed by the black of night , the silent stars , the wind stirring in the branches . Such is the routine . I have been living in this house for more than a year now , ever since they released me from the hospital . Miriam insisted that I come here , and at first it was just the two of us , along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off at work . Then , three months later , the roof fell in on Katya , and she dropped out of . lm school in New York and came home to live with her mother in Vermont . <p> His parents named him after Rembrandt 's son , the little boy of the paintings , the golden-haired child in the red hat , the daydreaming pupil puzzling over his lessons , the little boy who turned into a young man ravaged by illness and who died in his twenties , just as Katya 's Titus did . It 's a doomed name , a name that should be banned from circulation forever . I think about Titus 's death often , the horrifying story of that death , the images of that death , the pulverizing consequences of that death on my grieving granddaughter , but I do n't want to go there now , I ca n't go there now , I have to push it as far away from me as possible . The night is still young , and as I lie here in bed looking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceiling is invisible , I begin to remember the story I started last night . That 's what I do when sleep refuses to come . I lie in bed and tell myself stories . They might not add up to much , but as long as I 'm inside them , they prevent me from thinking about the things I would prefer to forget . Concentration can be a problem , however , and more often than not my mind eventually drifts away from the story I 'm trying to tell to the things I do n't want to think about . There 's nothing to be done . I fail again and again , fail more often than I succeed , but that does n't mean I do n't give it my best effort . <p> I put him in a hole . That felt like a good start , a promising way to get things going . Put a sleeping man in a hole , and then see what happens when he wakes up and tries to crawl out . I 'm talking about a deep hole in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such a way as to form a perfect circle , with sheer inner walls of dense , tightly packed earth , so hard that the surfaces have the texture of baked clay , perhaps even glass . In other words , the man in the hole will be unable to extricate himself from the hole once he opens his eyes . Unless he is equipped with a set of mountaineering tools  --  a hammer and metal spikes , for example , or a rope to lasso a neighboring tree  --  but this man has no tools , and once he regains consciousness , he will quickly understand the nature of his predicament . <p> And so it happens . The man comes to his senses and discovers that he is lying on his back , gazing up at a cloudless evening sky . His name is Owen Brick , and he has no idea how he has landed in this spot , no memory of having fallen into this cylindrical hole , which he estimates to be approximately twelve feet in diameter . He sits up . To his surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rough , dun-colored wool . A cap is on his head , and a pair of sturdy , well-worn black leather boots are on his feet , laced above the ankles with a firm double knot . There are two military stripes on each sleeve of the jacket , indicating that the uniform belongs to someone with the rank of corporal . That person might be Owen Brick , but the man in the hole , whose name is Owen Brick , can not recall having served in an army or fought in a war at any time in his life . <p> For want of any other explanation , he assumes he has received a knock on the head and has temporarily lost his memory . When he puts his fingertips against his scalp and begins to search for bumps and gashes , however , he finds no traces of swelling , no cuts , no bruises , nothing to suggest that such an injury has occurred . What is it , then ? Has he suffered some debilitating trauma that has blacked out large portions of his brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly returns to him , he will have no way of knowing . After that , he begins to explore the possibility that he is asleep in his bed at home , trapped inside some supernaturally lucid dream , a dream so lifelike and intense that the boundary between dreaming and consciousness has all but melted away . If that is true , then he simply has to open his eyes , hop out of bed , and walk into the kitchen to prepare the morning coffee . But how can you open your eyes when they 're already open ? He blinks a few times , childishly wondering if that wo n't break the spell  --  but there is no spell to be broken , and the magic bed fails to materialize . <p> A flock of starlings passes overhead , entering his field of vision for five or six seconds , and then vanishes into the twilight . Brick stands up to inspect his surroundings , and as he does so he becomes aware of an object bulging in the left front pocket of his trousers . It turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in addition to seventy-six dollars in American money , it contains a driver 's license issued by the state of New York to one Owen Brick , born June 12 , 1977 . This confirms what Brick already knows : that he is a man approaching thirty who lives in Jackson Heights , Queens . He also knows that he is married to a woman named Flora and that for the past seven years he has worked as a professional magician , performing mostly at children 's birthday parties around the city under the stage name of the Great Zavello . These facts only deepen the mystery . If he is so certain of who he is , then how did he wind up at the bottom of this hole , dressed in a corporal 's uniform no less , without papers or dog tags or a military ID card to prove his status as a soldier ? <p> It does n't take long for him to understand that escape is out of the question . The circular wall is too high , and when he kicks it with his boot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of foothold that would help him climb up , the only result is a sore big toe . Night is falling rapidly , and there is a chill in the air , a damp vernal chill worming itself into his body , and while Brick has begun to feel afraid , for the moment he is still more baffled than afraid . Nevertheless , he ca n't stop himself from calling out for help . Until now , all has been quiet around him , suggesting that he is in some remote , unpopulated stretch of countryside , with no sounds other than an occasional bird cry and the rustling of the wind . As if on command , however , as if by some skewed logic of cause and effect , the moment he shouts the word HELP , artillery fire erupts in the distance , and the darkening sky lights up with streaking comets of destruction . Brick hears machine guns , exploding grenades , and under it all , no doubt miles away , a dull chorus of howling human voices . This is war , he realizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but with no weapon at his disposal , no way to defend himself against attack , and for the first time since waking up in the hole , he is well and truly afraid . <p> The shooting goes on for more than an hour , then gradually dissipates into silence . Not long after that , Brick hears the faint sound of sirens , which he takes to mean that fire engines are rushing to buildings damaged during the assault . Then the sirens stop as well , and quiet descends on him once again . Cold and frightened as he is , Brick is also exhausted , and after pacing around the confines of his cylindrical jail until the stars appear in the sky , he stretches out on the ground and manages to fall asleep at last . <p> Early the next morning , he is woken by a voice calling to him from the top of the hole . Brick looks up and sees the face of a man jutting over the rim , and since the face is all he can see , he assumes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corporal , the man says . Corporal Brick , it 's time to get moving . <p> Brick stands up , and now that his eyes are only three or four feet from the stranger 's face , he can see that the man is a swarthy , square-jawed fellow with a two-day stubble of beard and that he is wearing a military cap identical to the one on his own head . Before Brick can protest that much as he 'd like to get moving , he 's in no position to do anything of the sort , the man 's face disappears . <p> Do n't worry , he hears him say . We 'll have you out of there in no time . <p> Some moments later , there follows the sound of a hammer or iron mallet pounding on a metal object , and because the sound becomes increasingly muted with each successive blow , Brick wonders if the man is n't driving a stake into the ground . And if it 's a stake , then perhaps a length of rope will soon be attached to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to climb out of the hole . The clanging stops , another thirty or forty seconds go by , and then , just as he predicted , a rope drops down at his feet . <p> Brick is a magician , not a bodybuilder , and even if climbing a yard or so of rope is not an inordinately strenuous task for a healthy man of thirty , he nevertheless has a good deal of trouble hoisting himself to the top . The wall is of no use to him , since the soles of his boots keep sliding off the smooth surface , and when he tries to clamp his boots onto the rope itself , he fails to gain a secure purchase , which means that he has to rely on the strength of his arms alone , and given that his are not muscular or powerful arms , and given that the rope is made of coarse material and therefore chafes his palms , this simple operation is turned into something of a battle . When he finally nears the rim and the other man takes hold of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brick is both out of breath and disgusted with himself . After such a dismal performance , he is expecting to be mocked for his ineptitude , but by some miracle the man refrains from making any disparaging comments . <p> As Brick struggles slowly to his feet , he notes that his rescuer 's uniform is the same as his , with the single exception that there are three stripes on the sleeves of his jacket , not two . The air is dense with fog , and he has difficulty making out where he is . Some isolated spot in the country , as he suspected , but the city or town that was under attack last night is nowhere to be seen . The only things he can distinguish with any clarity are the metal stake with the rope tied around it and a mud-splattered jeep parked about ten feet from the edge of the hole . <p> Corporal , the man says , shaking Brick 's hand with a firm , enthusiastic grip . I 'm Serge Tobak , your sergeant . Better known as Sarge Serge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a good six inches shorter than he is , and repeats the name in a low voice : Sarge Serge . <p> I know , Tobak says . Very funny . But the name stuck , and there 's nothing I can do about it . If you ca n't lick ' em , join ' em , right ? <p> What am I doing here ? Brick asks , trying to suppress the anguish in his voice . <p> Get a grip on yourself , boy . You 're fighting a war . What did you think this was ? A trip to Fun World ? <p> What war ? Does that mean we 're in Iraq ? <p> Iraq ? Who cares about Iraq ? <p> America 's fighting a war in Iraq . Everyone knows that . <p> Fuck Iraq . This is America , and America is fighting America . <p> What are you talking about ? <p> Civil war , Brick . Do n't you know anything ? This is the fourth year . But now that you 've turned up , it 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to make it happen . <p> How do you know my name ? <p> You 're in my platoon , dumbbell . <p> And what about the hole ? What was I doing down there ? <p> Normal procedure . All new recruits come to us like that . But I did n't sign up . I did n't enlist . <p> Of course not . No one does . But that 's the way it is . One minute you 're living your life , and the next minute you 're in the war . <p> Brick is so confounded by Tobak 's statements , he does n't know what to say . <p> It 's like this , the sergeant rattles on . You 're the chump they 've picked for the big job . Do n't ask me why , but the general staff thinks you 're the best man for the assignment . Maybe because no one knows you , or maybe because you have this . . . this what ? . . . this bland look about you , and no one <p> would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's it , assassin . But I like to use the word liberator . Or maker of the peace . Whatever you want to call it , without you the war will never end . <p> Brick would like to run away on the spot , but because he 's unarmed , he ca n't think of anything else to do but play along . And who am I supposed to kill ? he asks . <p> It 's not who so much as what , the sergeant replies enigmatically . We 're not even sure of his name . It could be Blake . It could be Black . It could be Bloch . But we have an address , and if he has n't slipped away by now , you should n't have any trouble . We 'll set you up with a contact in the city , you 'll go undercover , and in a few days it should all be over . <p> And why does this man deserve to die ? <p> Because he owns the war . He invented it , and everything that happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eliminate that head , and the war stops . It 's that simple . Simple ? <p> You make him sound like God . <p> Not God , Corporal , just a man . He sits in a room all day writing it down , and whatever he writes comes true . The intelligence reports say he 's racked with guilt , but he ca n't stop himself . If the bastard had the guts to blow his brains out , we would n't be having this conversation . <p> You 're saying it 's a story , that a man is writing a story , and we 're all part of it . <p> Something like that . <p> And after he 's killed , then what ? The war ends , but what about us ? <p> Everything goes back to normal . <p> Or maybe we just disappear . <p> Maybe . But that 's the risk we have to take . Do or die , son . More than thirteen million dead already . If things go on like this much longer , half the population will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no intention of killing anyone , and the longer he listens to Tobak , the more certain he becomes that the man is a raving lunatic . For the time being , however , he has no choice but to pretend to understand , to act as if he 's eager to carry out the assignment . <p> Sarge Serge walks over to the jeep , fetches a bulging plastic bag from the back , and hands it to Brick . Your new duds , he says , and right there in the open he instructs the magician to strip off his army uniform and put on the civilian clothes contained in the bag : a pair of black jeans , a blue oxford shirt , a red V-neck sweater , a belt , a brown leather jacket , and black leather shoes . Then he hands him a green nylon backpack filled with more clothes , shaving equipment , a toothbrush and toothpaste , a hairbrush , a .38-caliber revolver , and a box of bullets . Finally , Brick is given an envelope with twenty fifty dollar bills in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address of his contact . <p> Lou Frisk , the sergeant says . A good man . Go to him as soon as you get to the city , and he 'll tell you everything you need to know . <p> What city are we talking about ? Brick asks . I have no idea where I am . <p> Wellington , Tobak says , swiveling to his right and pointing into the heavy morning fog . Twelve miles due north . Just stay on this road , and you 'll be there by the middle of the afternoon . <p> I 'm supposed to walk ? <p> Sorry . I 'd give you a lift , but I have to go in the other direction . My men are waiting for me . <p> And what about breakfast ? Twelve miles on an empty stomach . . . <p> Sorry about that , too . I was supposed to bring you an egg sandwich and a thermos of coffee , but I forgot . <p> Before leaving to join his men , Sarge Serge pulls the rope up from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and tosses them into the back of the jeep . Then he climbs in behind the steering wheel and starts the engine . Giving Brick a farewell salute , he says : Hang in there , soldier . You do n't look like much <p> of a killer to me , but what do I know ? I 'm never right about anything . <p> Without another word , Tobak presses his foot on the accelerator , and just like that he is gone , disappearing into the fog within a matter of seconds . Brick does n't budge . He is both cold and hungry , both destabilized and frightened , and for more than a minute he just stands there in the middle of the road , wondering what to do next . Eventually , he starts to shiver in the frosty air . That decides it for him . He has to get his limbs moving , to warm himself up , and so , without the faintest notion of what lies ahead of him , he turns around , thrusts his hands into his pockets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just opened upstairs , and I can hear the sound of footsteps traveling down the hall . Miriam or Katya , I ca n't tell which . The bathroom door opens and shuts ; faintly , very faintly , I detect the familiar music of pee hitting water , but whoever has done the peeing is thoughtful enough not to flush the toilet and risk waking the household , even if two-thirds of its members are already awake . Then the bathroom door opens , and once again the quiet tread down the hall and the closing of a bedroom door . If I had to choose , I would say it was Katya . Poor , suffering Katya , as resistant to sleep as her immobilized grandfather . I would love to be able to walk up the stairs , go into her room , and talk to her for a while . Tell some of my bad jokes , maybe , or else just run my hand over her head until her eyes closed and she fell asleep . But I ca n't climb the stairs in a wheelchair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would probably fall in the dark . Damn this idiot leg . The only solution is to sprout a pair of wings , giant wings of the softest white down . Then I 'd be up there in a flash . <p> For the past couple of months , Katya and I have spent our days watching movies together . Side by side on the living room sofa , staring at the television set , knocking off two , three , even four films in a row , then breaking for dinner with Miriam , and once dinner has been eaten , returning to the sofa for another . lm or two before going to bed . I should be working on my manuscript , the memoir I promised to write for Miriam after I retired three years ago , the story of my life , the family history , a chronicle of a vanished world , but the truth is I 'd rather be on the sofa with Katya , holding her hand , letting her rest her head on my shoulder , feeling my mind grow numb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For over a year I went at it every day , building up a hefty pile of pages , about half the story I 'd guess , perhaps a little more , but now I seem to have lost the stomach for it . Maybe it started when Sonia died , I do n't know , the end of married life , the loneliness of it all , the fucking loneliness after I lost her , and then I cracked up that rented car , destroying my leg , nearly killing myself in the process , maybe that added to it as well : the indifference , the feeling that after seventy-two years on this earth , who gives a damn if I write about myself or not ? It was never anything that interested me , not even when I was young , and I certainly never had any ambition to write a book . I liked to read them , that was all , to read books and then write about them afterward , but I was always a sprinter , never a long-distance man , a greyhound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cranking out the seven-hundred-word piece , the fifteen hundred- word piece , the twice-weekly column , the occasional magazine assignment , how many thousands of them did I vomit forth ? Decades of ephemera , mounds of burned-up and recycled newsprint , and unlike most of my colleagues , I never had the slightest inclination to collect the good ones , assuming there were any , and republish them in books that no sane person would bother to read . Let my half-finished manuscript go on gathering dust for now . Miriam is hard at it , coming to the end of her biography of Rose Hawthorne , squeezing in her hours at night , on the weekends , on the days when she does n't have to drive to Hampton to teach her courses , and for the time being maybe one writer in the house is enough . <p> Where was I ? Owen Brick . . . Owen Brick walking down the road to the city . The cold air , the confusion , a second civil war in America . A prelude to something , but before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I need a few moments to reflect on Katya and the films , since I still ca n't decide if this is a good thing or a bad thing . When she started ordering the DVDs through the Internet , I took it as a sign of progress , a small step in the right direction . If nothing else , it showed me that she was willing to let herself be distracted , to think about something other than her dead Titus . She 's a . lm student , after all , training to become an editor , and when the DVDs started pouring into the house , I wondered if she was n't thinking about going back to school or , if not school , then furthering her education on her own . After a while , though , I began to see this obsessive movie watching as a form of self medication , a homeopathic drug to anesthetize herself against the need to think about her future . Escaping into a . lm is not like escaping into a book . Books force you to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagination , whereas you can watch a . lm  --  and even enjoy it  --  in a state of mindless passivity . That said , I do n't mean to suggest that Katya has turned herself into a stone . She smiles and sometimes even emits a small laugh during the funny scenes in comedies , and her tear ducts have frequently been active during the touching scenes in dramas . It has more to do with her posture , I think , the way she slumps back on the sofa with her feet stretched out on the coffee table , unmoving for hours on end , refusing to stir herself even to pick up the phone , showing little or no signs of life except when I 'm touching or holding her . It 's probably my fault . I 've encouraged her to lead this flattened-out existence , and maybe I should put a stop to it  --  although I doubt she 'd listen to me if I tried . <p> On the other hand , some days are better than others . Each time we finish a movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katya puts on the next one . I usually want to discuss the story and the quality of the acting , but her remarks tend to focus on the technical aspects of the . lm : the camera setups , the editing , the lighting , the sound , and so on . Just tonight , however , after we watched three consecutive foreign films  --  Grand Illusion , The Bicycle Thief , and The World of Apu  --  Katya delivered some sharp and incisive comments , sketching out a theory of filmmaking that impressed me with its originality and acumen . <p> Inanimate objects , she said . <p> What about them ? I asked . <p> Inanimate objects as a means of expressing human emotions . That 's the language of . lm . Only good directors understand how to do it , but Renoir , De Sica , and Ray are three of the best , are n't they ? <p> No doubt . <p> Think about the opening scenes of The Bicycle Thief . The hero is given a job , but he wo n't be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hock . He goes home feeling sorry for himself . And there 's his wife outside their building , lugging two heavy buckets of water . All their poverty , all the struggles of this woman and her family are contained in those buckets . The husband is so wrapped up in his own troubles , he does n't bother to help her until they 're halfway to the door . And even then , he only takes one of the buckets , leaving her to carry the other . Everything we need to know about their marriage is given to us in those few seconds . Then they climb the stairs to their apartment , and the wife comes up with the idea to pawn their bed linens so they can redeem the bicycle . Remember how violently she kicks the bucket in the kitchen , remember how violently she opens the bureau drawer . Inanimate objects , human emotions . Then we 're at the pawnshop , which is n't a shop , really , but a huge place , a kind of warehouse for unwanted goods . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the workers carry their little bundle to the shelves where pawned items are stored . At first , the shelves do n't seem very high , but then the camera pulls back , and as the man starts climbing up , we see that they go on and on and on , all the way to the ceiling , and every shelf and cubby is crammed full of bundles identical to the one the man is now putting away , and all of a sudden it looks as if every family in Rome has sold their bed linens , that the entire city is in the same miserable state as the hero and his wife . In one shot , Grandpa . In one shot we 're given a picture of a whole society living at the edge of disaster . <p> Not bad , Katya . The wheels are turning . . . <p> It just hit me tonight . But I think I 'm on to something , since I saw examples in all three films . Remember the dishes in Grand Illusion ? <p> The dishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German woman that he loves her , that he 'll come back for her and her daughter when the war is over , but the troops are closing in now , and he and Dalio have to try to cross the border into Switzerland before it 's too late . The four of them have a last meal together , and then the moment comes to say good-bye . It 's all very moving , of course . Gabin and the woman standing in the doorway , the possibility that they 'll never see each other again , the woman 's tears as the men vanish into the night . Renoir then cuts to Gabin and Dalio running through the woods , and I 'd bet money that every other director in the world would have stayed with them until the end of the . lm . But not Renoir . He has the genius  --  and when I say genius , I mean the understanding , the depth of heart , the compassion  --  to go back to the woman and her little daughter , this young widow who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what does she have to do ? She has to go back into the house and confront the dining room table and the dirty dishes from the meal they 've just eaten . The men are gone now , and because they 're gone , those dishes have been transformed into a sign of their absence , the lonely suffering of women when men go off to war , and one by one , without saying a word , she picks up the dishes and clears the table . How long does the scene last ? Ten seconds ? Fifteen seconds ? No time at all , but it takes your breath away , does n't it ? It just knocks the stuffing out of you . <p> You 're a brave girl , I said , suddenly thinking about Titus . <p> Stop it , Grandpa . I do n't want to talk about him . Some other time , maybe , but not now . Okay ? <p> Okay . Let 's stick to the movies . There 's still one to go . The Indian film . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> That 's because it 's about a writer , Katya said , cracking a brief , ironic smile . <p> Maybe . But that does n't mean it is n't good . <p> I would n't have chosen it unless it was good . No junk . <p> That 's the rule , remember ? All sorts of movies , from the wacky to the sublime , but no junk . <p> Agreed . But where 's the inanimate object in Apu ? <p> Think . <p> I do n't want to think . It 's your theory , so you tell me . <p> The curtains and the hairpin . A transition from one life into another , the turning point of the story . Apu has gone to the country to attend his friend 's cousin 's wedding . A traditional arranged marriage , and when the bridegroom shows up , he turns out to be an idiot , a blithering numskull . The wedding is called off , and the friend 's cousin 's parents begin to panic , afraid their daughter will be cursed for life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is asleep somewhere under the trees , not a care in the world , happy to be out of the city for a few days . The girl 's family approaches him . They explain that he 's the only available unmarried man , that he 's the only one who can solve the problem for them . Apu is appalled . He thinks they 're nuts , a bunch of superstitious country bumpkins , and refuses to go along . But then he mulls it over for a while and decides to do it . As a good deed , as an altruistic gesture , but he has no intention of taking the girl back to Calcutta with him . After the wedding ceremony , when they 're finally alone together for the first time , Apu learns that this meek young woman is a lot tougher than he thought she was . I 'm poor , he says , I want to be a writer , I have nothing to offer you . I know , she says , but that makes no difference , she 's determined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved by her resolve , Apu reluctantly gives in . Cut to the city . A carriage pulls up in front of the ramshackle building where Apu lives , and he and his bride step out . All the neighbors come to gawk at the beautiful girl as Apu leads her up the stairs to his squalid little garret . A moment later , he 's called away by someone and leaves . The camera stays on the girl , alone in this strange room , this strange city , married to a man she hardly knows . Eventually , she walks to the window , which has a cruddy piece of burlap hanging over it instead of a real curtain . There 's a hole in the burlap , and she looks through the hole into the backyard , where a baby in diapers is toddling along through the dust and debris . The camera angle reverses , and we see her eye through the hole . Tears are falling from that eye , and who can blame her for feeling overwrought , scared , lost ? Apu reenters the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says , shaking her head , nothing at all . Then we fade to black , and the big question is : what next ? What 's in store for this unlikely couple who wound up marrying each other by pure accident ? With a few deft and decisive strokes , everything is revealed to us in less than a <p> minute . Object number one : the window . We fade in , it 's early morning , and the first thing we see is the window the girl was looking through in the previous scene . But the ratty burlap is gone , replaced by a pair of clean checkered curtains . The camera pulls back a little , and there 's object number two : potted flowers on the windowsill . These are encouraging signs , but we ca n't be sure what they mean yet . Domesticity , homeyness , a woman 's touch , but this is what wives are supposed to do , and just because Apu 's wife has carried out her duties well does n't prove that she cares for him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of them asleep in bed . The alarm clock rings , and the wife climbs out of bed as Apu groans and buries his head in the pillow . Object number three : her sari . After she gets out of bed and starts walking off , she suddenly ca n't move  --  because her clothes are tied to Apu 's . Very odd . Who could have done this  --  and why ? The expression on her face is both peeved and amused , and we instantly know that Apu was responsible . She returns to the bed , thwacks him gently on the butt , and then unties the knot . What does this moment say to me ? That they 're having good sex , that a sense of playfulness has developed between them , that they 're really married . But what about love ? They seem to be contented , but how strong are their feelings for each other ? That 's when object number four appears : the hairpin . The wife leaves the frame to prepare breakfast , and the camera closes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as he yawns and stretches and rolls around in bed , he sees something in the crevice between the two pillows . He reaches in and pulls out one of his wife 's hairpins . That 's the crowning moment . He holds up the hairpin and studies it , and when you look at Apu 's eyes , the tenderness and adoration in those eyes , you know beyond a doubt that he 's madly in love with her , that she 's the woman of his life . And Ray makes it happen without using a single word of dialogue . <p> Same with the dishes , I said . Same with the bundle of sheets . No words . No words needed , Katya replied . Not when you know what you 're doing . <p> There 's another thing about those three scenes . I was n't aware of it while we were watching the films , but listening to you describe them now , it jumped right out at me . <p> What ? <p> They 're all about women . How women are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the real business while their hapless men stumble around making a hash of things . Or else just lie around doing nothing . That 's what happens after the hairpin . Apu looks across the room at his wife , who 's crouching down over a pot making breakfast , and he does n't make a move to help her . In the same way the Italian guy does n't notice how hard it is for his wife to carry those water buckets . <p> At last , Katya said , giving me a small poke in the ribs . A man who gets it . <p> Let 's not exaggerate . I 'm just adding a footnote to your theory . Your very astute theory , I might add . <p> And what kind of husband were you , Grandpa ? <p> Just as distracted and lazy as the jokers in those films . Your grandmother did everything . <p> That 's not true . <p> Yes , it is . When you were with us , I was always on my best behavior . You should have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment to shift my position in bed , to adjust the pillow , to take a sip of water from the glass on the bedside table . I do n't want to start thinking about Sonia . It 's still too early , and if I let myself go now , I 'll wind up brooding about her for hours . Stick to the story . That 's the only solution . Stick to the story , and then see what happens if I make it to the end . <p> Owen Brick . Owen Brick on his way to the city of Wellington , in which state he does n't know , in which part of the country he does n't know , but because of the dampness and chill in the air , he suspects that he 's in the north , perhaps New England , perhaps New York State , perhaps somewhere in the Upper Midwest , and then , remembering Sarge Serge 's talk about a civil war , he wonders what the fighting is about and who is fighting whom . Is it North against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? White against Black ? Whatever caused the war , he tells himself , and whatever issues or ideas happen to be at stake , none of it makes any sense . How can this be America if Tobak knows nothing about Iraq ? Utterly at a loss , Brick reverts to his earlier speculation that he is trapped in a dream , that in spite of the physical evidence around him , he is lying next to Flora in his bed at home . <p> Visibility is poor , but through the fog Brick can dimly apprehend that he is flanked by woods on both sides , that there are no houses or buildings anywhere in sight , no telephone poles , no traffic signs , no indication of human presence except the road itself , a badly paved stretch of tar and asphalt with numerous cracks and potholes , no doubt un repaired for years . He walks on for a mile , then another mile , and still no cars drive past , no people emerge from the emptiness . Finally , after twenty minutes or so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound that he is at pains to identify . Out of the fog , a man on a bicycle comes pedaling toward him . Brick raises his hand to catch the man 's attention , calls out Hello , Please , Sir , but the cyclist ignores him and scoots on past . After a while , more people on bicycles start showing up , some riding in one direction , some in the other , but for all the notice they pay to Brick as he urges them to stop , he might as well be invisible . <p> Five or six miles farther down the road , signs of life begin to appear  --  or rather signs of former life : burned-out houses , collapsed food markets , a dead dog , several exploded cars . An old woman dressed in tattered clothes and pushing a shopping cart filled with her possessions suddenly looms up in front of him . <p> Excuse me , Brick says . Could you tell me if this is the road to Wellington ? <p> The woman stops and looks at Brick with uncomprehending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her chin , her wrinkled mouth , her gnarled , arthritic hands . Wellington ? she says . Who asked you ? <p> No one asked me , Brick says . I 'm asking you . <p> Me ? What do I have to do with it ? I do n't even know you . <p> And I do n't know you . All I 'm asking is if this is the road to Wellington . <p> The woman scrutinizes Brick for a moment and says , It 'll cost you five bucks . <p> Five bucks for a yes or no ? You must be crazy . <p> Everyone 's crazy around here . Are you trying to tell me you 're not ? <p> I 'm not trying to tell you anything . I just want to know where I am . <p> You 're standing on a road , nitwit . <p> Yes , fine , I 'm standing on a road , but what I want to know is if this road leads to Wellington . <p> Ten bucks . <p> Ten bucks ? <p> Twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now at the limit of his patience . I 'll figure it out for myself . <p> Figure out what ? the woman asks . <p> Instead of answering her , Brick starts walking again , and as he strides off through the fog , he hears the woman burst out laughing behind him , as if someone has just told her a good joke . . . <p> The streets of Wellington . It 's past noon by the time he enters the city , exhausted and hungry , his feet aching from the rigors of the long trek . The sun has burned off the early morning fog , and as he wanders around in the fine , sixty-degree weather , Brick is heartened to discover that the place is still more or less intact , not some bombed-out war zone heaped with rubble and the bodies of dead civilians . He sees a number of destroyed buildings , some cratered streets , a few demolished barricades , but otherwise Wellington appears to be a functioning city , with pedestrians walking to and fro , people going in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air . The only thing that distinguishes it from your normal American metropolis is the fact that there are no cars , trucks , or buses . Nearly everyone is moving around on foot , and those who are n't walking are mounted on bicycles . It 's impossible for Brick to know yet if this is a result of a gasoline shortage or municipal policy , but he has to admit that the quiet has a pleasant effect , that he prefers it to the clamor and chaos of the streets in New York . Beyond that , however , Wellington has little to recommend it . It 's a shabby , down-at-the-heels kind of place , with ugly , poorly constructed buildings , nary a tree in <p> Excerpted from Man in the Dark by Paul Auster <p> Copyright 2008 by Paul Auster <p> Published in 2008 by Henry Holt
