These kick-ass activists are kicking ass // WITH BUSH II IN OFFICE , IT 'S MORE CRUCIAL THAN ever that progressives join in and work for change . If you want to get involved , here 's our second installment on organizations doing important activist work . Critical Resistance Critical Resistance is building a national campaign to challenge systemic injustices in courts , police departments , and prisons by bringing together groups engaged in legislative , legal , educational , and direct-action activities . Its goal is to change the policies and attitudes that have allowed the U.S. prison population to surpass all others . " It 's tough bringing together prison issues , death penalty issues , and labor issues . For example , a lot of problems in prisons are acted out by the guards , who are unionized , and so how do you work with that ? Of course you try to be pro-labor and pro-union . This is why we need a dialogue between activists and people they would n't normally end up in the same room with . " Linda M. Thurston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oakland , Calif. 94612 ( 510 ) 444-0484 !

" He never said so , but I think he regretted sending Rafe away . " <p> " You only think that because you did n't hear what Rafe said to him before he left , " Dolores told her sister . <p> Maria knew what had been said . The servants had recounted the argument to her many times over the last nine years . But Warren 's actions of the last several years caused her to believe he 'd regretted throwing Rafe out of the house . He 'd never mentioned Rafe 's name when Dolores was present , but Maria had often come upon him staring at a miniature of Rafe taken when he was a young boy astride his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after years of being hidden in a cabinet with other reminders of Rafe . <p> " If the letter Rafe sent the lawyer is a reflection of his present feelings , I doubt he will come home , " Maria observed . <p> " He 's got to come home .

The lawyer is empowered to make necessary decisions until Rafe returns . " <p> " That lawyer hates me . I swear it hurts him to give me my pitiful allowance . Do you know he had the nerve to suggest I use it to buy food ? I barely have enough to dress myself .

For a woman who 'd been brought up to believe she deserved to be waited on hand and foot , being forced to become a glorified servant was the ultimate humiliation . After Mrs. Jerry 's death and Dolores 's subsequent marriage to Warren Jerry , Dolores had invited her sister to live at the ranch . <p> " I can use my allowance for food if necessary , " Maria volunteered . <p> " You do n't need to . You have control of the household accounts . " <p> Dolores had been happy to turn over the accounts and the household duties to her fifteen-year-old sister soon after Maria arrived , but she was furious when the lawyer would n't return control of them to her after her husband 's death . I 'm only following the instructions in Mr. Jerry 's will , Henry Fielder had told her . <p> Dolores lay back on the daybed , her arm over her eyes . " Rafe was so in love with me , he went crazy when I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think I should marry him now that I 'm free ? " <p> Maria was used to her sister 's capriciousness , but this was a step beyond what she could accept . " After what happened , I think you should keep as far away from him as possible . " <p> " He 's much younger than his father and a lot better-looking . " Dolores smiled , petting the little dog who had jumped up on the daybed with her . " Besides , I like being Mrs. Jerry a lot more than the widow Jerry . " <p> Rafe brought his horse to a stop on a ridge overlooking the big Cfbola Creek where it dropped into the valley below . He had never forgotten this view because it was one of his favorites . Unfortunately , it brought back a bitter memory as well . It was on this spot that he 'd first told Dolores he loved her . <p> The letter in his pocket burned like a hot coal . He wished he had never responded to the newspaper ad requesting that anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Warren Jerry , contact the law offices of Henry Fielder in Cfbola , California . He had n't spoken to his father since he 'd walked out of his house ten years ago , yet his father had made him sole executor of a ranch he 'd inherited jointly with a half brother he 'd never seen . He was a thirty-year-old bachelor . What could he have in common with a nine-yearold child ? <p> " Where is your ranch ? " asked Rafe 's closest friend , Broc Kincaid . During the Civil War , Broc had served with Rafe in a cavalry unit that conducted night raids on shipments of supplies , munitions , and gold . He 'd come to California with Rafe in hopes of finding Laveau di Viere , the man who 'd betrayed their unit to the Yankees . <p> " Down there . " Rancho los Alamitos land stretched as far as Rafe could see . " Everywhere . All of it . " <p> Broc 's eyes grew wide . " I can see thousands of acres from here . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acres . " <p> Broc stared dumbfounded at the fertile acres stretching into the distance until they merged with the horizon . " How could you leave all this ? It 's almost as beautiful as Tennessee . " <p> How could he explain that he did n't want to be heir to a ranch worth millions , that he did n't want to be the guardian of a half brother he did n't know , that he wanted nothing to do with a woman who decided she 'd rather be his stepmother than his wife ? He 'd been happy ranching in Texas with some of the other men from his cavalry unit . The work was hard , but the bunkhouse was comfortable , the food good , and the friendship the kind that could n't be bought . Why would he give that up for the responsibility of a huge ranch , an undoubtedly spoiled child , and the conniving bitch who 'd broken his heart ? <p> Rafe had n't told anyone that Dolores-the woman he 'd once loved-had seduced his father while he was grieving over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been thrown out of the house because he could n't treat his stepmother with respect . As he gazed out over the lush acres , some of the anger inside him eased . He loved this place , and that was a large part of the reason he 'd come back to California . To see the ranch again . " I did n't leave the land . " <p> Broc shook his head . " Must have been something really bad to make you give up this . " <p> " I thought so at the time . " He had n't changed his mind , so why had he come back ? Why had he needed to come back ? <p> " You going down there , or are we going to see if we can find any trace of Laveau ? " <p> They had traveled up the coast of California , following the line of the old Spanish missions . They had found reports of Laveau in Monterey and San Francisco , but the traitor was always one step ahead of them . <p> " We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rafe told Broc . " I hope he can explain why my father wrote that infernal will . When I walked out of here , I told him I never wanted to see this place again . " <p> " You 're his son , " Broc reminded him . " Naturally he 'd want you to have your inheritance . " <p> Rafe had lost all desire for his inheritance ten years ago-his half brother could have it all . Rage burned hot within him . He could feel the life he 'd spent ten years building for himself slipping away . He was being drawn back into a quagmire of blighted love and shattered idealism , of lust , avarice , lies ... and hate . <p> " He has another son , one he wanted more than me . " Rafe reminded himself he was n't angry at the boy . Even though his creation was the source of the enmity between Rafe and his father , the child was innocent . He would not judge this child until he 'd seen him . It was possible he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words my father spoke to me were to order me out of the house . " <p> Broc turned his horse away from the cliff overlooking the ravine . " Apparently he changed his mind . Let 's head into town . " <p> Henry Fielder was middle-aged , gaunt , and inhabited a law office as small and cluttered as an old maid 's closet . Clean shaven and nearly bald , he looked at Rafe out of clear , piercing blue eyes . " You ca n't turn everything over to me , " he said . " The will specifically states that you , and you alone , must be executor of the estate . " <p> Rafe had nothing against Henry Fielder , but he had never liked lawyers . They lived in a world of their own , creating rules no one else could understand . They said these laws benefitted the average citizen , but as often as not , a man discovered what he wanted to do was the one thing he could n't do . <p> " That may be what my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Texas . I 'm sure Dolores will pay you anything you want if you can figure out some way to get around the will . " <p> " First , the will states that the present Mrs. Jerry is never to have control of any portion of the ranch or its management . She has her allowance and nothing else . " <p> Rafe found it hard to believe that his father would make such a provision . He had loved his first wife , but Dolores had captivated him with her youth and beauty when he was grieving and vulnerable . <p> " If you reject the provisions of the will , " the lawyer continued , " I 'm directed to sell the ranch . A portion will be set aside to increase your stepmother 's allowance tenfold . She will retain that allowance even if she should remarry . The remainder of the proceeds will be used to create a park in honor of your stepmother . You will , in essence , disinherit your brother and yourself . " <p> Rafe 's fury at the net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was sure his temperature had risen ten degrees . He had no doubt his father had added that provision to make sure he did n't ignore the will and just disappear . Rafe would n't care whether he lost his half of the ranch and he might not care whether he was disinheriting his brother , but his father knew Rafe would do whatever was necessary to prevent the creation of anything that honored the whore who 'd become his stepmother . <p> A question gradually penetrated his rage , a question he 'd asked before , but which now assumed added significance : What had happened to cause his father to make such a will ? As much as he wanted nothing to do with Dolores or his half brother , he needed to know what had changed . <p> " Why ? " <p> A veil dropped over the lawyer 's eyes . " I beg your pardon ? " <p> " Do n't fence with me . This is the opposite of what I expected . You 've got to have some idea what caused him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs of affability . " I was your father 's lawyer , not his confessor . " <p> The man had to know , or at least suspect , what had happened , but he was n't going to say anything . Rafe would much rather be chasing Laveau , but Laveau would have to wait until he solved the puzzle of what had happened at Rancho los Alamitos . <p> * * * <p> Damn . How did a small ad in a Chicago newspaper find its way to Texas ? Five more months , and I could have been richer than I 'd ever imagined . I ca n't give up now . I 'm too close . <p> " Rafe is coming to the ranch . That horrible lawyer said he 'll be here sometime today . " <p> Maria could n't understand her sister 's excitement . Dolores had been running around the house giving instructions to every servant she saw . She 'd changed the dinner menu three times , discussed and discarded a half dozen ideas for which dress to wear , and had driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructions about how to behave so he would n't upset his brother . <p> " Did he say anything about the will ? " If anyone had consulted her-and Dolores rarely did-Maria would have suggested meeting Rafe in the lawyer 's office . The decision as to whether he would be the executor was more important than any impression they might make on a single visit . <p> " He said Rafe had agreed to be the executor . " Dolores looked at the dress she was holding up with disfavor . " I 've got to get him to increase my allowance . I ca n't keep going around in this rag . " <p> The rag she was talking about had been worn only once . The black velvet glittered with hundreds of tiny glass beads in swirling designs that made the gown seem alive when Dolores moved . <p> " If you want to convince him you need an increase in your allowance , do n't wear that dress , " Maria advised . " Not only does it look expensive , but it makes you look especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sister 's beauty nor her need to be the focus of attention . Managing the household and overseeing Luis 's education was a big job , but she enjoyed the responsibility . The servants were hardworking and loyal , and she loved Luis like her own son . <p> Dolores paused before her mirror , critically studying her reflection . " I ca n't welcome him home looking like a faded old woman . " <p> " You look neither faded nor old . " <p> " He last saw me when I was nineteen . That was ten years , one husband , and one child ago . " She made a face . " His father kept telling him I was his stepmother . I 'll die if he still thinks of me like that . " <p> " I 'm sure he does n't . And if he did , one look at you would change his mind . " Maria smiled at her sister 's pleased reaction to her comment . " Now get dressed . I 'm going to see about Luis . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay in his room . " <p> " I 'm sure Rafe will expect to see his brother . " Maria hated to use that word to describe the relationship between Luis and Rafe . She 'd promised herself she would be cordial because this meeting was important to Dolores and Luis , but she was n't sure how she could be pleasant to a man she despised . She was n't a good actress like her sister . It had always been easy for people to guess her feelings . <p> " Very well , but do n't let him stay more than a few minutes . " <p> " I 'll take care of that . Now get dressed . You 've got to be downstairs when he arrives . You 're the only one he knows . " <p> Maria left her sister 's room and tried to put Dolores and Rafe out of her mind . His mother 's strictures had upset Luis so much that he could n't eat his lunch . He was well grown for his age , but he was so shy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment 's notice . He was n't so young that he did n't know his father had wanted little or nothing to do with him . Maria could understand that , but she could n't forgive it . Unfortunately it was impossible to explain the reason to Luis . She knocked on the door to his room before entering . <p> Luis was seated next to a window with a view of the road leading up to the house . He looked so darling in his formal clothes , Maria was tempted to hug him . He never stinted in his show of affection for his aunt , but recently he had become uncomfortable with the hugs and caresses he 'd enjoyed so much when he was younger . At nine he was already showing signs of the young man he would grow up to be . <p> Luis turned when Maria entered the room . " Do you think Rafe will like me ? " <p> " Of course he 'll like you . You 're his brother . " Maria tried to sound reassuring , but she did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might respond . <p> " Maybe he does n't want a brother he 's never seen . Mama says he hates children . " <p> " I do n't know what he was like when he was growing up , but I 'm sure he must be fond of children by now . He 'll surely be happy to know he has a brother as smart and handsome as you . " <p> " Rosana says he 's so handsome , every signorina from here to Sacramento will be sighing over him . Juan says he can outride and outshoot anybody in California . I ca n't do anything like that . " <p> Maria hated it when people compared Luis to Rafe . " He 's a grown man . You 're still a boy . I 'm sure he could n't do any of those things when he was your age . " <p> " Juan said he could ride a horse before he could walk . " <p> Maria laughed . " I 'm sure he rode sitting in his father 's lap and holding on tight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth . <p> " Papa never took me in his lap . He did n't teach me how to ride . " <p> Maria had been grateful to Warren Jerry for giving her a home , but she would never forgive him for the way he 'd treated Luis . <p> " Your papa was older when you were growing up , and he was sick a long time before he died . I 'm sure he would have taught you to ride if he had been younger and in good health . " She knew that was n't true and suspected Luis knew it as well . The picture Warren had kept by his bedside , and his will , confirmed Maria 's belief that he 'd spent his last years regretting his separation from Rafe . <p> " Will he send me away to school ? " <p> The question caught Maria off guard . " What do you mean ? " <p> " Juan says all boys are sent away to military school when they 're ten or eleven . He says it turns them into men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Your father was not Spanish . " <p> " Both my grandmothers were . " <p> Maria deplored the pattern of Spanish fathers marrying their daughters to Anglo men , even though it had proved to be the best way to hold on to Spanish land grants after California became part of the United States . She rested her hand on his shoulder . " I promise I wo n't let him do anything to make you unhappy . " <p> " Maybe I should go to military school . All the boys on the ranch ride better than I do . " <p> " Only because riding is part of their work . " <p> " I wish I could ride well . I wish I could do something well . " <p> Maria had done all she could to give Luis confidence in himself , to make him feel loved and valued , but that was next to impossible when neither his mother nor his father showed any interest in him . <p> " You do lots of things very well , " Maria assured him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one cares about that . " He sounded dismissive of his own achievements . " They only care about how many tricks you can perform on horseback or how well you can shoot . " <p> Maria had always enjoyed the contests the local men indulged in during festivals , but she disliked that they used such stunts as a measure of manhood and character . <p> " Is that my brother ? " Luis pointed at two men approaching the house along the lane from town . The darker one was leading a pony . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
