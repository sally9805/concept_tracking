The Hungarian-born billionaire has spent $4 billion on causes from fighting disease to fostering democracy , but his latest passion is politics  --  and he has pledged at least $15 million to defeat President Bush . He also blasts Bush foreign policy in a new book , The Bubble of American Supremacy , and is taking his message to college campuses . TIME 's Karen Tumulty talked with him . <P> WHY IS A MULTIBILLIONAIRE HANGING AROUND ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES ? In my book , I argue that it 's not enough to reject the Bush Administration 's policies in the election , but we also have to rethink America 's role in the world . It concerns the future of the students currently on campus , so I 'm taking these issues to them . <P> DO YOU HATE GEORGE BUSH , OR WHAT ? No , I think that he has taken the country and the world in a very dangerous direction . And I think that he was elected on a platform of a humble foreign policy , and since Sept. 11 we have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it 's very important that we should reject his policies . <P> CRITICS HAVE CALLED YOU AN EXTREMIST AND AN OUT-OF-TOUCH LEFT-WING RADICAL . WHAT 'S YOUR RESPONSE ? I have been engaged for the last 15 years in promoting the values of an open society throughout the world . It is those who describe me as an extremist who happen to be the extremists against whom I am warning the electorate . <P> YOU HAVE COMPARED GEORGE BUSH 'S POLICIES WITH THOSE YOU EXPERIENCED LIVING UNDER NAZI AND SOVIET TOTALITARIANISM . THAT 'S PRETTY TOUGH STUFF . WHAT DID YOU MEAN ? I did not call Bush a Nazi , and I would n't call him a Nazi , because I know the difference between an open society and a totalitarian regime . However , when he says that those who do n't support him are supporting the terrorists , I am reminded of Nazi Germany and communist Soviet Union . The Bush Administration has been able to brand those who oppose their policies as unpatriotic , and that endangers the very essence of an open society . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TO SPENDING BY INDEPENDENT POLITICAL GROUPS . WILL THAT AFFECT YOUR POLITICAL SPENDING ? No . I am not violating either the letter of the law or the spirit . The letter , because the institutions that I 'm supporting were there before I started supporting them . The spirit , because campaign-finance regulation has been designed to deny access to special interests , and by supporting these organizations , I gain no access . <P> HOW MUCH MORE OF YOUR MONEY DO YOU INTEND TO PUT INTO THE EFFORT TO DEFEAT BUSH ? As little as possible . But there is a tremendous discrepancy in the amount available to the Bush Administration 's truth machine and those who are critical of it . I feel that it 's necessary to ensure that there is at least an audible voice to oppose the onslaught on the Democratic candidate that is imminent . <P> WHICH OF THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES DO YOU LIKE THE BEST ? I was keen on Dean . I have very high respect for General Clark , whom I knew in the Balkans . And I 'm absolutely delighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because a war hero who wants to use military force only as the last resort stacks up very well against a warmonger who has not experienced war personally .
