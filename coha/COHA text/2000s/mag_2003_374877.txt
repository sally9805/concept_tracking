Mao Zedong inexplicably arrived an hour early at the red-lacquered Gate of Eternal Peace , entrance to the 500-year-old palace of China 's emperors . He had chosen a symbol of ancient power in which to declare his new China . The man in charge of preparations , a loyal soldier named Guo Ying , 24 , who had been fighting with the communists since he was 13 , seated Mao in the former emperor 's waiting room and fetched him a bowl of apples . There Guo learned that Mao , in his haste , had forgotten the ribbon that each new communist leader pins to his tunic . <P> Just outside , in Tiananmen Square , 300,000 people squinted through a yellow haze of soot to see the man who , after two decades of fighting , had routed the American-backed forces of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek . As Mao waited , Guo dispatched a comrade to find a piece of red satin and write " Chairman " upon it in gold . That crisis averted , Mao stood on the rostrum above a massive portrait of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central government of the People 's Republic of China is established ! " " Long live Chairman Mao ! " answered the crowd , which began cheering soldiers fresh from battle as they marched in the new country 's first military parade . Guo stood behind Mao and wept for " a victory won with the blood of millions of revolutionaries . "  --  By Matthew Forney
