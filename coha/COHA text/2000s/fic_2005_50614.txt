IT WAS AN ACCIDENT . Dugan was taking pictures and he was smoking and the grass against the side of the church was dry as wood shavings . It was a small church , white and peaked , and it sat at the end of a long gravel drive amid tobacco fields and red dirt . He leaned against the wall to get a shot up the length of the steeple , and as he tossed his cigarette into the grass , he walked to the other side of the church without once looking down . His eyes were fixed on the cross , stark against the sky , and he did n't know that the grass had caught until he saw the smoke wrapping its fingers around the church . Dugan beat at the fire with his jacket , but the flames hissed at him like a cat backed into a corner . The fire spread and the whitewashed boards glowed orange , and the wind kept blowing and then the wall was a curtain of flame . Dugan winced at the heat on his face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one else had seen the fire , he scrambled into his car and sat his camera on the passenger seat . It was the middle of the day on a Monday , and there was n't another soul around for miles . The sky was blue and the only clouds were high and wispy . The wind billowed the cottonwoods at the edge of the field and pushed the fire onto the roof , and Dugan knew that there was no stopping it . No alarm would sound , no fire trucks would battle the blaze , no rain would fall . The fire would consume and consume until it had eaten its fill and then it would collapse , exhausted , into an ashy heap . <p> The keys were in the ignition and smoke was pouring into the sky , but Dugan could n't take his eyes off the church . The smoke twisted , making curlicues in the wind , and the clapboard glowed orange as if outlined in brilliant neon . He had set in motion something terrible , something irreparable , and minute by minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steering wheel in a rapid-fire cadence that matched the bitter rush of goddamnits pouring out of him . But he did not start the car and put the church behind him . Instead , he grabbed the camera , wrenched open the door , and started shooting . He ran around the church coughing and sweating , the sound of the fire like branches snapping in a storm . Only when he had filled the roll with smoke and flames did he run back to the car and gun the engine , gravel rioting in the wheel wells . <p> Out on the county road , his eyes raked the rearview mirror for signs of other cars , for anyone who might have seen him speeding away from the church . He thought for the first time about calling the police or the fire department and reached for the cell phone clipped to the visor , but withdrew his hand quickly , as if the phone were an ember flung by the fire . Even if they believed it was an accident , they were sure to have a problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he should have been calling for help . <p> He checked the rearview again , expecting a burst of police lights , an onrushing cruiser , the mirrored bug eyes of a sheriff . Still nothing . Three miles from the church Dugan started to let himself believe that he was in the clear . His heart , which had felt bolted to the side of his chest , let loose with a rush of blood that sent his head swimming . He wished there were someone in the passenger seat , someone who had seen everything , from the moment he dropped the cigarette until now . Someone who could see behind the facts and read what was in his heart . It 's not your fault . It just happened . But the seat only held the camera , its single eye staring mutely up at him . <p> There were n't any police cars waiting for him at home , just the same squat , brick house , four rooms on a single story . Inside , his coffee cup sat next to the leather sofa he and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen table was piled with unopened mail , clothes were thrown over the back of a folding chair in the bedroom , and the toilet seat was up . For the first time he could remember , he was glad that Debbie was n't home . In the bedroom , he hit the button on the answering machine . <p> " Hey , sweetie . My study group is running late , so I 'm going to grab dinner up here and then head back to the library . Hope you 're having a good day . Love you ! " <p> He took a deep breath and played the message again . Hearing Debbies voice always steadied him , and today he needed plenty of steadying . His clothes reeked of wood smoke , and his head was still buzzing with the din of timbers popping , fire spreading . He thought again about calling the police , but what was there to say ? Sorry I burned down the church ; it was an accident , ! promise . <p> He pulled a beer from the refrigerator and undressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes , including his jacket , socks , and underwear , into the washing machine with half a bottle of detergent , and set it on hot . He drank the beer in the shower , hoping the scalding water would melt the day out of his memory and purge his skin of smoke and sweat and misery . <p> That night the local news led with a report about the church . The pastor , a grayhaired black man in wire-rimmed glasses , talked about the loss to the community , the state of shock that the mostly older , mostly rural congregation felt , and how some people might not find out about the fire until they showed up for services on Sunday and saw only a pile of charred boards . An investigator from the Durham Fire Department said that the blaze looked like it was set intentionally , and that it might be connected to the rash of church burnings in the Southeast during the past summer . Already it seemed too late for him to come forward and explain what had happened ; it would only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers would call him a criminal , or a racist , or an idiot . There could be a trial , and prison . And of course there was Debbie . That was the worst of it . <p> This never would have happened in Chicago . Dugan had had that thought a hundred different times , about things large and small , since the move to North Carolina , and it hit him again as he sat on the couch switching between the local channels . Chicago , where he had spent his first thirty years . Chicago , where he and Debbie had met and married . Chicago , where he managed a science-fiction bookstore and had friends he had known since grade school . And Chicago , where at least he knew which way was up . The layout of the city , its streets rising numerically from the corner of State and Madison , came as naturally to Dugan as knowing his right hand from his left . Dugan was the kind of person whom strangers stopped on the street to ask for directions , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matrix of one-ways , and the lattice of diagonal avenues were visible to anyone seeking guidance . He had known he was in for a change when they packed the moving truck , but back then-it seemed like someone else 's life now-he figured that all he needed was Debbie to orient him . She was the reason for moving south , and after three years of law school they would be back in Chicago-Debbie at a law firm in the Loop and Dugan back at the bookstore . <p> He had anticipated that her classes would take up a lot of time , but he had n't counted on the study groups , law review , moot court , happy hours , and a lot of names of classmates and professors that he could never put to faces . During her first year at Duke , it seemed to Dugan that he was on the phone every day saying , " Do n't worry about it , I understand , have fun , I 'll see you when you get in , " until he stopped answering the phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought he could convince Debbie , simply by not answering the phone , that he was out living his life , but the time he spent waiting for the phone to stop ringing and the machine to pick up became another item on the list of things that never would have happened in Chicago . In Chicago , he and Debbie ate dinner together , they went to the movies twice a week , they hung out with their friends , and they went to sleep at the same time . He did n't shrug and shake his head when people asked him , " Do you know where ... ? " And he never burned down any churches in Chicago . <p> The day after the fire Dugan was scheduled for the opening shift at work . Since the move , he had been working in a warehouse-size bookstore that carried more than a thousand different magazines and ten kinds of cappuccino . He had once told his manager that he had experience arranging readings from touring authors and that he used to publish a monthly newsletter for his bookstore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty dollars a month for construction paper and markers and asked him to decorate one of the display windows . <p> Before unlocking the doors Dugan checked the Durham Herald-Sun and The Raleigh News e- Observer ; both papers ran a picture of the blackened remains of the church on the front of the local news section . He was certain that customers could smell the smoke emanating from his skin , and more than once he sniffed the sleeves of his shirt while waiting for the next customer to step up to the register . Dugan usually liked to strike up conversations with people who bought books he had read , even though most people just shrugged or said they were buying it for a class , but the day after the fire he did n't talk to anyone . He ran the books over the scanner , swiped credit cards , and handed over receipts . <p> He thought about going straight home after work-holing up and watching the news to find out if the police had any leads on the fire-but he figured the best thing to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arouse suspicion . Here I am , he thought , already thinking like a criminal-and not just a criminal , but a fugitive from justice . When his shift ended , he drove to the community college for his photography class , never once breaking the speed limit . <p> Dugan had signed up for the class during Debbie 's second year at Duke after deciding that if he spent one more night at home waiting for her call , loneliness wrestling with self-loathing , he was going to give himself an ulcer . There was always a stack of course catalogs from the community college at the entrance to the bookstore , and one day Dugan called to register for a figure drawing class that promised " intensive study of the nude . " At the time he saw Debbie so infrequently that he was willing to pay five hundred dollars to stare at a naked woman twice a week for fifteen weeks . But the drawing class had been full , so Dugan dug the camera out of the closet-the expensive SLR he had bought for their honeymoon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The class was taught by a woman named Lillian , who had the short , spikybanged haircut favored by artsy women over fifty-a style Debbie had once called a Premarin pixie . Lillian wore chunky necklaces and bracelets that , to Dugan 's eye , could have been made of plastic , bone , or Chiclets . From the first day of class , Lillian had encouraged her students to find the beauty in everyday objects . She showed them photographs of paper clips , hubcaps , laundry hanging on a line . " Beauty is n't something you make , " she told the class . " Its something you find . " Dugan liked the class and particularly liked the room where it met , with its smell of chemicals and plastic , the wet shine of exposed film , and the high-backed stools and tall tables where the students sat . But mostly he liked having somewhere to be two nights a week ; as each semester ended , he signed up for the next course in the sequence , all of which were taught by Lillian . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Hippie Chick was in her twenties and talked a lot about beauty , which meant anything natural , and ugliness , which was anything made of metal , plastic , or concrete . Trees were beautiful , so was the ocean ; cars and telephone poles were ugly . Five people said they were taking the class because they wanted to be pet photographers , which Dugan had never realized was such a booming industry . There was Christian Dad who wanted to take pictures of his daughter " suitable for framing " and who cursed by saying " Merry Christmas ! " whenever he made a mistake in the darkroom . There was Punk Rock Girl , Asian Guy , and Real Estate Lady , who carried a briefcase and wore frothy pastel suits . Sometimes he wondered what they called him : Beard Guy . Weird Guy . Weird Beard Guy . <p> On the first day of class , Lillian had told them to choose a common place or object for the subject of their portfolios . Dugan knew exactly what he would have picked if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nighttime photographs of hot dog stands whose notoriety derived as much from their names as from the quality of their food . The Wieners ' Circle , First National Frank , the Wiener and Still Champion : three more items on the list of things he missed about Chicago . Durham did n't have any hot dog stands , but it had plenty of churches ; he could n't even guess how many roadside chapels he passed on the drive from the bookstore to the college : Lighthouse Missionary Baptist Church , Salt of the Earth Church of God in Christ , Rock of Ages Holiness Church , and a dozen others . No saint 's names , no sorrowful mysteries , just the promise of scripture and salvation . It was during his day off from work yesterday that he 'd stumbled across the little white church in the middle of the tobacco field-the one with the peaked roof and the tall steeple-and turned off the county road to take a closer look . <p> At the start of the Tuesday night class , Lillian turned on the projector and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ocean in the 19505 and ' 60s . She showed twenty slides , one mushroom cloud after another , and recited the location of each test as if it were the Latin name of a tropical plant : Eniwetok , Bikini Atoll , Christmas Island .... When she finished she switched on the lights and faced her blinking students . " Well ? " she said . " Reactions ? " ? <p> " Disgusting , " Hippie Chick said . Her tangled blond hair was held back by yarn , and she wore a loose-fitting dress and sandals . " It 's like looking at the face of the devil . " <p> Dugan watched the others in the room look down at the table or up at the screen , as if the images were still visible . They did n't care about the slides ; they wanted to commiserate over how much trouble it was to get a dog to sit still once you put a hat on it . <p> " Anybody else ? " <p> It was obvious what Lillian wanted ; she wanted them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Lillian said . " Just the image , on its own terms . " <p> Still no one else spoke . There were nights when Dugan gave her the answer she was looking for , not because he agreed with her , but because he could n't bear the silence , could n't bear the sight of Lillian floating up there , willfully ignored by a roomful of people . And that alone might have been reason enough to say something tonight . Except , he did see the beauty . In black-and-white the clouds did look like mushrooms , but in color , they were n't mushrooms at all . They were pulsing flowers of orange , yellow , and red , blooming a million fiery petals into the blue sky . The images seemed to ooze upward . If it were possible to sculpt with lava , this is what it would look like . <p> " It 's kind of beautiful , right ? " Dugan said . " I know that underneath all of that light and color there 's an island being vaporized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what 's the harm ? " Around the room eyebrows raised and a few heads shook . Comments like that , he realized , were why no one ever talked to him during the break when the students filed outside for a cigarette or a diet cola . <p> " The harm ? " Hippie Chick said . " What about the environment ? " <p> " There are other islands , " Dugan said . " Its not like they blew up the best one , is it ? " He looked around the room , a gallery of averted gazes . <p> " It 's pure destruction , " Hippie Chick said . " It 's evil . " <p> Dugan shrugged . " I did n't say it was good or evil . I just said it was sort of beautiful . " As the words left his mouth , he got the lurching sense that he had said too much-that he had let himself get swept away in Lillians nonsense . The church did n't burn because the world was lacking in beauty . Why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it . I burned it down ! " <p> Lillian inhaled sharply , a cue that she was about to resume the class , when a voice piped up from the back of the room . <p> " I agree with him , sorta , " Punk Rock Girl said . " I do n't think it matters if it 's beautiful or ugly . We 've got to look at everything . You ca n't close your eyes and pretend something does n't exist just because you do n't want to see it . " Lillian nodded and looked around the room , her eyes wide in an effort to reignite the discussion . Dugan slouched lower into his chair , and Hippie Chick made an audible tsk . <p> " OK , " Lillian said , " let 's pick up the discussion we were having in the last class about the pros and cons of tripods . " <p> After an hour the class had a ten-minute break . Everyone left the classroom and filed out into the courtyard that separated the school from the parking lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hinted at the arrival of autumn . Dugan steered himself away from the others and pulled a cigarette from the pack . <p> " You should n't smoke , " Punk Rock Girl said . She was narrow shouldered and young , barely out of high school . She had a ring in her nostril , two more in her eyebrow , and too many to count in her ears . Her hair , matte black and streaked with pulpy red , was cut into a severe bob . With her dark eyes and loops of silver wire , she looked like Theda Bara on acid , or a Blade Runner replicant , or a member of the Borg collective . She smiled , and Dugan saw a row of perfect teeth . She 'd had braces . Expensive ones . <p> " You should n't tell people what to do , " he said . <p> " You want to get cancer ? " She said it lightly , like a joke , and again flashed those unstained teeth . Her final portfolio was going to be a series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are worse things , " he said , exhaling a long plume of smoke . " Besides , I thought people down here liked smoking . Keeps the tobacco farmers in business . " <p> " I 'm not from down here , " she said , the smile disappearing . " I 'm supposed to be in San Francisco . " <p> " California , huh ? Well , that explains it . " <p> " My stupid mother is what explains it . " OK , Dugan thought , not barely out of high school-still there . " What about you ? " she said . " You do n't sound like you 're from down here . " <p> " Chicago , " he said , taking another long drag . <p> " Why would you ever leave there for here ? " <p> There was a long version of the story and a short one . His gaze drifted above the low-slung buildings of the community college while he sought the quickest way to explain why he had left : " Love , I guess . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accompanied by a nod of the head . That was a good reason , Dugan thought , but it left a lot out . He checked his watch and dropped the cigarette , careful to crush it under his foot before going inside . <p> Dugan stopped at a fast-food drive-through after class , then wended through the city streets for hours , listening to the local talk-radio station . Every call was about the church fire . People wanted to know who would do such a thing , and how it could happen here . " Racist or not , " one caller said , " you do n't go burning down a house of God . " " I hope he likes fire , " said another , " because he 's got an eternity of flames waiting for him . " He did n't get home until late , and the house was dark , the driveway empty . Turning the bolt on the front door he moved quickly , without turning on the lights , to punch the button on the answering machine . " Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ library . I 'll probably be another hour or two , then it 's straight home . Promise ! see you soon . " <p> The Thursday after the fire , while the others cut mats for their prints , Lillian asked to see Dugan at the back of the room . She was wearing a button pinned to her dress-the word HATE with a diagonal red line through it . <p> " Dugan , " she said , " I 'm sure you know about the fire at the church . " <p> Dugan froze , unsure if he should confess , deny , play dumb , bolt from the room . If Lillian had figured it out , the police could n't be too far behind . Perhaps she had already called them . Dugan stammered , trying to sound vague , noncommittal . " Terrible , terrible thing , " he said . <p> " And you especially must feel the weight of it . " <p> " Me ? " he said , fear beginning to give way to confused relief . <p> " While you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . It makes the work you 're doing all the more important . " <p> Dugan nodded and uh-huh 'd while Lillian prattled on about the need to demonstrate to the congregation , to the state , " even to the nation , " that Durham was a city that would not tolerate this kind of hate crime . All kinds of people- " white , black , and brown , " in Lillian 's words-were coming together to turn the fire into an opportunity to show that love and unity would always conquer hate . That 's where Dugan came in . <p> " What I was hoping , " Lillian said , her hand on Dugan 's arm , " and I know this is a long shot , but what I was hoping was that you might have taken some pictures of the church before this tragic act . " <p> Dugan 's voice caught in his throat . The roll he had taken at the church was at the house , in a box on a shelf at the back of a closet . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community , " Lillian said . She dropped her voice and spoke to Dugan in a solemn tone . " You know , with the healing . " <p> The healing . Maybe there was something Dugan could do to make up , in a very small way , for the fire . He had abandoned any thoughts of turning himself in , but now Lillian was offering a way for the pictures-some of the pictures , the pictures taken before the fire-to serve a purpose . They could help with the healing , and that had to count for something . He doubted that the callers on the talk-radio shows would see it that way , but Dugan was willing to take his second chances wherever he could find them . <p> Dugan nodded his head . " Of course , " he said . " I think I do have some pictures of that church . Not developed , but I could take care of that . " <p> " That would be so wonderful , " she said , giving his arm a sympathetic squeeze . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wanted Dugan 's photos mounted for display . She leaned in close , her voice a whisper . " I have some friends on the organizing committee who would be thrilled to see those pictures . " <p> At the word thrilled , a smile spread across Dugan 's face . A committee thrilled to see his pictures . A whole community healed by his pictures . Discreetly , Lillian handed him a key to the darkroom ; she did n't want the other students to think that he was getting special privileges because of the importance of his project . <p> The round trip from the college to his house and back took almost an hour , and by the time he returned to the photography studio it was deserted . Dugan worked slowly in the darkroom ; it was close to eleven by the time he compiled the contact sheet , which looked like a comic-book version of the fire . The first shot was the front of the church , its double doors and hand-lettered sign : Tree of Life Missionary Baptist Church . The next few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length of the steeple , and from a variety of other angles . On the drive back to the community college , he had told himself loudly and repeatedly-he was in need of convincing-that he was not going to print the pictures of the fire , even though the film was in his pocket , even though he would be the only person in the building . But with one glimpse of smoke on the contact sheet , his resistance crumbled . It was the fourteenth picture on the roll : the roofline bisecting the frame , wisps of smoke clearly visible on the right . In the images that followed , he saw smoke dense and black caught in the wind and spiraling around the narrow steeple . The sky had been turquoise blue that day , but in the pictures it was a translucent gray , the way it looked over Lake Michigan on cloudy winter afternoons when the sky and the lake merged into a pale smudge on the horizon . The loupe pressed to his eye , he strained to see if smoke had been visible in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame where it first appeared , the moment the camera noticed , even before he did , that something had gone awry . He would enlarge a few , just a few , and then destroy them after he had had a really good look . That seemed reasonable . He printed one , then another , and then another , clipping the pictures to the drying line as they emerged from their chemical bath . <p> He was swishing a print in the pan of solvent when he heard the dick-whoosh of the darkroom door . He turned , the print flopping from the tongs in his right hand . <p> " Hey , Cancer Man , what are you doing here ? " <p> Dugan froze . Nothing moved but his eyes , which darted from Punk Rock Girl 's face to the row of pictures suspended between them . " You 're not supposed to be here , " he said , trying to sound authoritative but knowing it came out shaky and plaintive . <p> " I 've got my own key , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it so the image faced her . " I come here all the- " <p> He saw in her eyes the moment that it hit her . <p> Oh my God , " she said , her pierced pixie face twisted into a knot . " You 're the guy ! " <p> He shushed her-a long jet of static , a punctured aerosol can . <p> She took a step back , her hand half turning the knob of the inner door . " You 're like some kind of neo-Nazi KKK guy , right ? " <p> " It was an accident , " he said , starting to yank the prints from the line . " Honest , an accident . " <p> She reached for the last picture he had developed , a bold slash of smoke rising over the building . Dugan grabbed for it , creasing the paper and smearing his hands on the slick surface . She snatched the print away from him and held it behind her head , her elbow angled outward . <p> " You 've got to believe me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was happening until it was too late . There was nothing I could do . " <p> She looked up at Dugan and narrowed her eyes , then glanced over her shoulder at the picture . Her face softened , but he could n't tell if it was a smile or a smirk . <p> " I 'm going to throw them all out , " he said . " I swear . " <p> " You ca n't do that , " she said . She took a step away from the door and lowered the picture . She held it flat in front of her so that Dugan could see the image . Gray sky , white wood , black smoke . " This is amazing . Are you going to use it for your portfolio ? " <p> Dugan sputtered and shook his head rapidly from side to side . " Are you nuts ? " <p> " You burned down a whole church and you 're not even going to use the pictures ? " <p> " I 'm telling you , it was an accident , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for support , his eyes jumping from the girl 's face to the picture she held to the prints in his left hand to his right hand , empty except for the viscous damp of the fixer . " I want to forget it ever happened . " <p> " Forget it ? " Her voice echoed in the closet-size room . Dugan flinched ; there was n't supposed to be anyone else in the building , but he had already been wrong about that once tonight . She grabbed the corner of one of the prints in his hand and shook it against the others . " Then why did you take all these pictures ? " she said . <p> Dugan stared hard at her , his face as hot as it had been outside the church . He had been asking himself the same question for days , but he had n't found an answer that sounded even remotely right . It had something to do with him , and with Debbie , and the way the church looked , and with not being where he wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better , the only answer was that he did n't know . <p> The girl was smiling again . " And what did you mean , ' all ' of them ? " she said , yanking another of the prints out of his hand . <p> " All of what ? " <p> " You said you were going to throw them all out . How many pictures are there ? " <p> Dugan looked down into a pan of solvent . " There 's half a roll , " he said . <p> " Twelve pictures , " she said . " But it was an accident . " The last word hung in the small room . She stepped away from the door , closer to Dugan . " So , " she said , " you want some help ? " <p> Punk Rock Girl-whose real name was Chandra-told Dugan that she had been into photography since she was " like , ten years old " and that she was only taking the class for access to the darkroom . Her parents ' house was n't far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of professors lived . " You think I could actually learn anything from old Lillian ? " she said as she coaxed from the negatives a wave of flame rising up the side of the church and fans of smoke sweeping over the steeple . " ' Find the beauty . ' Give me a break ! " They printed every picture on the roll , the shots of the church before the fire for Lillian and a complete set of twenty-four for Dugan . He told Chandra he wanted to see the whole sequence , start to finish , just once ; and then he was going to burn all the prints and the negatives . He promised her that this was what he was going to do , and she smiled and said , " Of course you will . " <p> As he pulled into his driveway the first stirrings of sunrise were staining the edges of the sky . His shift at the bookstore started at 9:30 . He hunched over the answering machine , punching the button before falling heavily into bed . " Dugan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ , where are you ? It 's really late , and I 've got to finish this brief by tomorrow . I think I 'm just going to crash at Kate 's place . I 'll see you tomorrow . " <p> By the time Dugan arrived at the service on Sunday , the gymnasium was packed . It was just as Lillian had predicted : hundreds of people , black , white , and brown , most of them in jackets and ties or floral dresses and hats tied with extravagant bows . The room buzzed with conversation and the flapping of photocopied programs pressed into service as fans . It was hot-stifling , even . Dugan thought of shedding his blazer but could already feel his back soaked , his armpits damp . Without the jacket , he would look like a drowning man . He was picking his way through the folding chairs on the basketball court when Lillian spotted him and waved him toward the front . She was saving a seat for him , and for the first time Dugan saw that his pictures-the prefire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loves your photographs , " Lillian said , squeezing his arm . <p> Dugan scanned the room and saw the bright flash of Chandra 's hair a few rows behind him . She waved and brought her hand to her mouth , turning an imaginary key between her lips . Dugan sank in his chair , a pit opening up in his stomach . <p> " Should we save a seat for your wife ? " Lillian said . <p> " No , " Dugan said . " She's-she wo n't be able to make it . " <p> The service lasted almost two hours : one after another , ministers from local churches took the podium to offer words of comfort to the congregation and promises of support in their efforts to rebuild . In less than a week people from all over the state had donated money , building supplies , temporary meeting space , whatever the pastor and his flock needed . The pastor had vowed to rebuilda new church , larger than the old one and full to the rafters every Sunday . From the cries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron-laced ceiling , Dugan figured that Tree of Life would n't have any problems filling its pews , and that people from around the city-white , black , and brown-would make the new church a centerpiece of their efforts to prove their point about unity . For a few months at least . <p> After the last sermon , the crowd rose from their seats and migrated toward the long tables piled with doughnuts and urns of coffee . Lillian went to round up some friends she wanted Dugan to meet , people " active in the community " who could " appreciate his project . " Standing on the balls of his feet , Dugan scanned the room for an escape route , then knifed through the crush of bodies that pressed in to see his pictures . As much as he was straining to see a silver lining in all of this , he did n't want to spend the next hour shaking hands and being told what a blessing he had provided with his photographs . And as for Chandra-what was she doing here ? He could only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glare of all of this ignorant goodwill was too much to pass up : Here was a girl who needed other hobbies . <p> As suddenly as his thoughts had turned to Chandra , there she was , grabbing him by the arm and steering him toward a door under one of the basketball hoops . She was wearing fewer earrings and had pulled one of the loops out of her eyebrow ; this apparently was her Sunday best . He allowed himself to be drawn along , her bitten-down nails wrapped around his wrist , but when he stopped after a few paces , she pulled against his weight like a small dog straining its leash . Dugan shook free of her and folded his arms . He glared down at her and quietly asked why she was stalking him . <p> " In your dreams , " she said , her smile blood red . " My mom is on one of these committees for the people whose church was mysteriously burned down . She was thrilled when I told her I wanted to come today-thinks it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Lillian 's group ? " <p> " Are you kidding ? Lillian 's nobody . My mom teaches at the law school-civil rights , that sort of thing . Maybe your wife has had her . " <p> The heat in the room suddenly flared ; Dugan tottered on his feet . " Maybe , " he said , mopping a sleeve across his forehead , then added , " I doubt it . " This was supposed to be a three-season blazer , but the stores in Chicago never accounted for the tenacity of a southern summer . With a glance over his shoulder , he ducked through the door , Chandra close behind . A short hallway led to the parking lot . <p> " So you 're like a big hero , " Chandra said , once they were outside . " Without you , none of this- " <p> " Keep it quiet , will you ? " he said through gritted teeth . <p> " Do n't worry about it . " <p> " I am going to worry about it . Have you told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her tongue . " Who am I going to tell ? " <p> " I do n't know-your civil rights-lawyer mother ? " <p> " As if , " she said . <p> " Friends at school ? " <p> " Not a problem there . " <p> " Your boyfriend ? " <p> Chandra stuck out her tongue-pierced , Dugan saw , with a silver ball that sat like a pearl in the center . Apparently that did n't come out on Sundays . " I guess you have n't seen the losers at my school . " <p> " As long as you- " <p> " Dugan . " She leaned in close , her voice a sharp whisper . " Do you really think you 'd be here if I 'd told anyone ? You 'd be , like , in prison or something . " <p> " That 's ridiculous , " he said , but he knew it was n't . He had let himself believe that his chances of being connected to the fire waned with every day that passed , and that in another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of unsolved crimes and move on to something else . Had n't he helped with the healing ? Did n't that count for anything ? Now all he had was the cold comfort that Chandra had n't said anything , yet . <p> From out of her bag-a child 's lunchbox decorated with cartoon horsesChandra pulled a cell phone , its black faceplate adorned with a red , circled A. " I could call right now , " she said . <p> He told her to cut it out . Told her it was n't funny . <p> " Nine , " she said , staring right at Dugan and slowly pushing the button on her phone . One , " she said , drawing out the word , then pressing the keypad again . She was loving this , every minute of it . And he was dying . It 's Sunday . I 'm sweating through my clothes . I 'm being stalked by a teenager . I burned down a church . I do n't know where the hell my wife is . <p> " Enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> On one condition , " she said . " The next time you do it , you 've got to take me with you . " <p> " The next time I do what ? " he said . <p> " You know " Chandra pantomimed smoking a cigarette then casually dropping it over her shoulder . Her lips formed the word oops . <p> " Chandra , there is n't going to be a next time . It was an- " <p> " Yeah , yeah , I know . An accident . Right . " They were alone in the parking lot , but she leaned in closer , her eyes seeking his . Dugan turned his head to follow the leaves scrabbling across the blacktop . " There must have been something that you liked about it , " she said . <p> Dugan closed his eyes and tried to slow his breathing . <p> " Do you still have the pictures ? " she said . <p> " Yes , " he said , barely above a whisper . <p> " Have you looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes more tightly shut . Opening them , he felt the sting of the air ; maybe autumn was on the way after all . Chandra stood in front of him , her pearly smile beaming . <p> " So let 's do it , " she said . " Nobody gets hurt , and some lucky congregation gets a better church out of it . You 're practically Robin Hood . " <p> Dugan 's head wobbled on his shoulders , a slow , silent no directed at all of the things he had put in motion and was powerless to stop . <p> His house was empty . He yanked off his tie and called the bookstore to say he was sick and would n't be able to close that night . Maybe he 'd feel better by tomorrow , but he was n't sure . He opened a beer and ran his shirt and pants though the washing machine again . He still could n't shake the sensation that woodsmoke had permeated the fabric-or maybe it was his skin , his hair , his breath . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body would give him away . He had cleaned the house in the days since the fire , trying to put things in their place , but there were a few tasks he just did n't have the energy for . He needed to pull out the screens and bring the storm windows up from the basement . He needed to deal with the pile of unopened mail on the dining room table-the FedEx 's and registered letters and manila envelopes from the messenger service . In the bedroom he pulled on a clean pair of pants and a T-shirt . He knew what the message was , and wished that he did n't have to listen to it today of all days , but still he pushed the button : " It 's me . Look , I know you got the packet because the delivery guy said that you signed for it . So please just sign everything and get it back to your lawyer . OK ? Dugan ? " <p> Dugan spent Monday wallowing at home . He did n't want to go out , did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything new or different or unexpected to happen . He took another long shower , washed the towels twice , and worked his way through twenty episodes of Dr. Who on DVD . He felt the world spinning under him , faster than he could keep up , and he felt it accelerate on Tuesday morning at the bookstore when he cut the nylon strap that bound a stack of morning papers and saw the headline : SECOND CHURCH BURNS . His stomach lurched , and he spent the day torn between competing thoughts : The second fire was good because he did n't do it , and when they caught the person who did , they would probably pin the first fire on him , too . And the second fire was bad because he 'd given the arsonist the idea in the first place and thus was the inspiration for a crime . The second fire was good in a legalistic , **26;2273;TOOLONG sort of way , but bad in a karmic , **29;2301;TOOLONG sort of way . <p> At the start of Tuesday 's class , Lillian used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church as an example of what she called " the timeless power of art . " Last nights fire had only made the stakes clearer , Lillian said . Dugan was on the front lines against the forces of savagery , and for that , she said , he deserved a round of applause . The clapping was sporadic , arrhythmic , like coins tumbling slowly out of a pocket . Chandra clapped loudest and longest . It was n't until the clapping subsided that Dugan noticed that Chandra , sitting in the back , was debuting a new hairstyle : oily black had been replaced with bright orange , tipped at the ends with yellow and blue . She told Lillian it was a show of solidarity with the churches that had been burned , and Lillian said it was lovely , just ... lovely . Dugan wondered how much longer it would be until she shaved " Dugan Did It " into the back of her head . <p> During the break in the class , Dugan went outside to his usual spot near the concrete benches . Hippie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pet photographers stood closer to the building , talking in low voices . If they did n't like him before , when he was just the guy in the back of the room who liked mushroom clouds , then they hated him after ten minutes of Lillian telling them how important his work was . Ten minutes that could have been spent talking about the proper film speed for shooting a dog catching a Frisbee . <p> Chandra bounded up to Dugan and asked for a cigarette . <p> " What about getting cancer ? " he said . <p> " Worse things , right ? " she said . <p> For a minute they smoked in silence , Chandra stifling a cough . <p> " I did n't have anything to do with it , " Dugan said . <p> " With what ? " Her eyes were dewy-if he did n't know her better , he 'd say they were innocent-but her smile simmered . " Oh , the fire last night ? Of course you did n't . " <p> " I did n't , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . A plume of smoke jetted from her pursed lips . A smile bloomed . " I did . " <p> " You did what ? " <p> " I set it . And I 've got to tell you , you made it sound really easy , and it 's not . It 's hard as hell . Took me forever to get that place burning . " <p> Dugan let the cigarette fall from his fingers . " Are you crazy ? " he said . <p> " No , are you ? You did it , too , you know . " <p> " That was an accident . You know that . " <p> " Sure it was , " she said . " And so was last night . " He looked into her eyes , bright and unblinking , and thought : This is what it was like for Dave trying to reason with HAL ; she 's launching all of my escape pods-there 's no way out . <p> " Look , do n't sweat it , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should be a white church . I do n't want anybody to think we 're racists . " <p> " Chandra , there 's no ' we . ' " The lights in the parking lot had come on and moths were thwapping against the sodium bulbs . The other students were filing back into the building . Dugan turned his back on Chandra and began walking , eager to put distance between them : she was getting too close , standing too near , assuming that they were in this together when they could n't be more different . Then he stopped and looked back at her . " You 're just doing this to piss off your mother , are n't you ? " <p> " No , " she said petulantly . " This is great for my mother . She gets to be on TV , talking about what a tragedy this is , and how much further we have to go as a nation , and blah blah blah . " <p> " And you get to laugh at her because you know the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're totally retarded , " she said . " I just wanted to take some pictures . " She crushed the cigarette under her shoe , very like the way that Dugan did . " So what have you told your wife ? " she said , barely stifling a smile . <p> " Nothing , " Dugan said . " She ca n't get mixed up in anything illegal . " <p> " What the little woman does n't know wo n't hurt her ? " <p> " Look , " he said , suddenly angry . " You do n't know what you 're talking about . " <p> Chandra picked at one of the twenty or so buttons pinned on her jacket-some band Dugan had never heard . " It 's fine by me if you do n't want to tell her , " she said . " It 's our little secret , right ? " <p> " I 'm going back in , " he said . He was exhausted , and he hoped that the familiarity of the studio-its astringent smells and sharp corners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty could be found in even the worst scenes-would keep his heart from splitting into two raw and decidedly unbeautiful halves . <p> " What could you possibly learn in there ? " Chandra said . She extended one hand . " Let 's go for a ride . " <p> " I 'm not going anywhere with you , " he said . <p> " Dugan , " she said , pouting , " be nice . " A fire truck raced past the far end of the parking lot , sirens blaring and red and yellow lights punching holes in the darkness . <p> " Is that one of yours ? " he said , and resumed walking toward the building . <p> " Hey , Dugan . " Her voice echoed on the concrete walls . " I was at the law school the other day . " <p> He stopped , but could n't face her . <p> " Do n't get mad , but I asked my mom if she could look up your wife-you know , to see if she had her in class . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could run inside . He knew his choices , and neither seemed fair . <p> " Well , see , my mom did n't remember her . " The fire engine rounded a corner , the squeal of its sirens dopplering to a low whine . " And the thing is , I had her secretary look her up in the system , and it said she already graduated . Last May . The address they had for her was in New York . " <p> Dugan dug his hand into his pocket and squeezed his keys , the metal teeth biting into his hand . He cleared his throat , hoping he could keep his voice level . " That 's really not your business , " he said . <p> " Do n't get mad at me , OK ? I was just worried about you . " <p> " I 'm fine , " he said , too quickly . " Worry about yourself , why do n't you ? " <p> " Dugan , do n't be like that . " <p> " I have to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached for his shoulder , but he brushed her hand aside like the spoke of a turnstile . Without looking back he let his shaky legs carry him into the parking lot . She would probably tell : tell her mother , tell Debbie , tell the police , tell everybody . Let her tell . Let it all come out . <p> The house was dark , the driveway empty . The last envelope to arrive , already skimmed with dust , lay in a pile with the others on the table in the dining room . Next to that pile he had arranged the photographs in order , from the first wispy traces of smoke to the fire in full bloom . It started too easily , and it burned too quickly , too completely . He thought that by going over the images , and then going over them again , he could understand not just how it had happened , but why . Was that too much to expect from any picture , or any single moment ? Maybe the church was just ready to burn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster every day , was enough to light the match . Dugan shambled into the bedroom without looking at the answering machine . He could smell charred wood on his clothes , but he did n't bother taking them off . He collapsed onto the bed and fell heavily to sleep , his dreams full of red light piercing the night sky . <p> Author Affiliation
