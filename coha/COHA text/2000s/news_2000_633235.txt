<p> 1 . Bobby Labonte <p> Money : <p> $ 3,550,341 . <p> Points : <p> 5,061 . <p> Rank : 2nd . <p> How do you define " NASCAR breakthrough ? " Try " Bobby Labonte 's 1999 season . " Career-best five victories . Second in Winston Cup points , his highest ranking ever . A total of 23 top-five finishes , all but five of which were top-threes . Only three yellow flags . Only one DNF . Yeah , we 'd call that a breakthrough . <p> So how come he 's not the defending Winston Cup champion ? Because his eight finishes outside the top 10 start with a lowly 19th and go down , down , down from there  --  two 24ths , a 25th , a 26th , a 27th , a 37th and a 38th . To win the 2000 title , Labonte needs to turn those mid-20 's ( and worse ) into mid-teens . <p> Labonte has the horses to do it . His No. 18 Interstate Batteries ride is the best Pontiac in the field  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anticipated NASCAR rule changes will probably shrink the Grand Prix 's spoiler ( and make the car fractionally slower ) , but Pontiacs will likely remain tops in 2000 . Chevy and Ford are bringing out new models , and their teams will need time to maximize performance . <p> His biggest challenge may come from his teammate at Joe Gibbs Racing , Tony Stewart , who won three races in 1999 and had the finest rookie Winston Cup season ever . <p> And few scenarios get NASCAR hearts pumping faster than a rivalry between teammates . What makes this particular intra-garage duel so tasty is the difference in personalities . Labonte takes a measured , patient approach on the oval . Stewart brings an Earndhardt-like greediness to the track that sometimes gets him in trouble  --  even with Labonte . <p> 2 . Dale Jarrett <p> Money : $ 3,608,829 . <p> Points : 5,262 . <p> Rank : 1st . <p> By finally winning a Winston Cup , Dale Jarrett solidified his place among the greatest losers in NASCAR history . Greatest what ? No , really , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You see , only three other modern-era drivers have taken home a championship with fewer wins than Jarrett 's four in 1999  --  Terry Labonte ( two wins in 1984 , two in 1996 ) , Darrell Waltrip ( three in 1985 ) and Alan Kulwicki ( two in 1992 ) . Like those other worthy champions , Jarrett was a master of the art of " third-placing " the competition into submission . <p> The Winston Cup point structure penalizes a bad finish far more than it rewards a victory , so consistency is what NASCAR championships are made of . In his march to the Winston Cup , Jarrett 's four wins only placed him fourth in the series ( Bobby Labonte won five , Jeff Burton won six , Jeff Gordon seven ) . In fact , after his big Brickyard 400 victory at Indianapolis in early August , Jarrett did n't drive his No. 88 Quality Care Ford Taurus down victory lane again the entire season . He even stumbled a bit early in the stretch run before wrapping up the title with eight straight top-10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closing dominance came as no surprise to anyone who had witnessed his remarkable midseason stretch of 19 races in which he finished no lower than eighth . Jarrett has never been the flashiest or most aggressive competitor . He does n't think he the most talented driver out there . But he has sufficient confidence , plenty of maturity and a Robert Yates engine under the hood . <p> While he 's well past the retirement age for most athletes , Jarrett seems to be just hitting his stride at 43 . <p> 3 . Tony Stewart <p> Money : $ 2,615,226 . <p> Points : 4,774 . <p> Rank : 4th . <p> Rookie of the Year ? How about Rookie of Any Year ? After what Tony Stewart did last season  --  first rookie since Davey Allison in 1987 to win a race , most wins ( three ) and best finish ever in Winston Cup points ( fourth ) for a first-timer  --  NASCAR ought to come up with a new award for the guy . Rookie of the Millennium ? <p> And it 's not just what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 28-year-old NASCAR neophyte demonstrated the tensile strength and laser-beam intensity of a veteran master . He was ruthless at Michigan in a mano a mano with Jeff Burton , who ended up in the wall . He was technically skillful at New Hampshire , where he dominated the race before pitting for gas with three laps to go . He was explosive after crashing at Martinsville , where he hurled his heel pads at hapless Kenny Irwin , a longtime open-wheel foe who has struggled like a normal newcomer in Winston Cup . <p> Two years ago , Stewart was nothing special in the Busch series , his first go-around in a stock car since defecting from the IRL . But last season he blossomed instantly in the more powerful Winston Cup cars . Most drivers struggle at first with the extra horsepower ; Stewart needed it to excel . But what 's truly impressive is how he has paced himself and protected his equipment during NASCAR 's long races . After his first win , at Richmond last September , he set a record for stating the obvious : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rookie season . " <p> The 2000 season may set up perfectly for Stewart 's first championship . This year , with Ford and Chevy unveiling new models , Stewart 's Pontiac may give him an edge on having the greatest sophomore season in history . <p> 4 . Mark Martin <p> Money : <p> $ 2,783,296 . <p> Points : <p> 4,943 . <p> Rank : 3rd . <p> The hardest worker on the circuit , Mark Martin has never had it easy . Even in 1998 , when he drove to a career-high seven wins , fate hit him hard . In the heart of his greatest season , Marthin 's father , Julian , died while piloting his private plane . <p> The 1999 season brought no tragedy for the driver of the No. 6 Valvoline Ford , but it was his flattest season since his winless 1996 . He did win twice in ' 99  --  at Rockingham in February and Dover in September  --  but he failed to mount any serious challenge during the stretch run to points leader and eventual champion Dale Jarrett . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind Pontiac driver Bobby Labonte with six races remaining . True , as every Mark Martin fan knows , finishing second or third in the championship race is just about par for the course for the 41-year-old veteran . He has finished second or third in points in seven of the last 11 seasons , and has n't finished lower than sixth since 1988 , his first year with roush Racing . But his championship dreams keep getting dashed . <p> Martin can take solace in his reputation as the best NASCAR driver never to have won a championship , His intensity is unmatched among his fellow competitiors . But could that virtue be working against him ? Is he too intense ? Having fun is not a priority for Martin or his workaholic car owner , Jack Roush . <p> Martin 's biggest question entering the 2000 season may wind up being his biggest asset . He has been plagued by an aching back for several years , and was considering surgery at the end of the 1998 season , but delayed it until the end of last season . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the season . <p> 5 . Jeff Burton <p> Money : $ 5,211,301 . <p> Points : 4,733 . <p> Rank : 5th . <p> Knocked out of the Daytona 500 in the big crash , Jeff Burton won at Las Vegas and Darlington in March and shot to the top of the Winston Cup points standing . He then reeled off four top-10 finishes in the next five races and headed to Richmond , one of his best tracks , with a 55-point lead over Dale Jarrett . <p> But then , while Burton was cruising along in the lead on lap 240 , he felt a bad vibration . The drive train of his transmission broke . He finished 37th and dropped to second in points . Even though he won the Coca-Cola 600 two weeks later , Burton never again tasted the lead in the championship points battle . Jarrett won Richmond , then cemented his place at the top with 11 straight finishes of sixth or better . <p> Meanwhile , Burton faded . He won again at New Hampshire in July but was unable to match @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the summer races in Pocono all but sealed his fate . Wins at Darlington and Rockingham in the stretch boosted his final ranking to fifth , but could n't raise his title hopes . <p> Consistency is the only element missing from the Burton arsenal . He 's smart . He 's teamed with Mark Martin . And he 's equipped with the best Fords car owner Jack Roush can provide . Burton and crew chief Frankie Stoddard have two full years of experience together and a tight relationship that has produced back-to-back fifth-place Cup finishes . <p> After Burton 's Rockingham win , Roush brushed off observations that he looked bored as Burton celebrated in Victory Circle . <p> " Jeff and Frankie have done such a good job that I now count on the working together as they did , " Roush said . <p> 6 . Jeff Gordon <p> Money : $ 5,281,361 . <p> Points : 4,620 ( 6th ) . <p> The skinny : Gordon 's versatility is unmatched in the Winston Cup . It does n't matter where the race is . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the superspeedway at Daytona , the two-mile oval in California , the 1.5 mile speedways at Atlanta and Charlotte , the road courses at Sonoma and Watkins Glen and the short track at Martinsville.
