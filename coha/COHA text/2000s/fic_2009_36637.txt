TOT LOT  --  THIRD ENTRANCE <p> His name is Grayson Donald and he is dead . His body hangs from the chipped orange rim of a basketball hoop on a full-sized green and red court adjacent an empty tot lot in a clearing in the woods between two streets of habitacles in a high-growth subdivision in an incorporated township called Centreville in Northern Virginia . A black and gnarled path leads from the street to the clearing and it continues through the clearing twisting and splitting where the roots it covers fight against it and opens onto the other street of homes . The subdivision if viewed from above by the angels and demons in heaven peering over the edges of the clouds for sight of the soul due them forms a complex network like a maze , the systematic perfect darg of an exotic species of beetle . The body of the dead boy is seventeen years old . It has more or less completed its sudden morphing from the ungendered body of a boy to the odorous and hairy imago of a man . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as is the groin . It seems his lower half received his father 's barbigerous DNA and the upper half his half-Irish mother 's set of fair genes ( or those Irish genes could be from his father as no one is sure exactly what his father is  --  a barnacle accumulated from the itinerant ramblings of European vagrants and mongrels ) . He is like a half man , half beast from mythology . His shoe size is 91+2 . The body sways in the November night . There is no breeze . After his feet knocked off of his father 's stepladder , his body kicked and fought , his hands went to his neck , the rope dug into it so deep , and pulled upon it . This does n't mean that he thought it was a mistake once the irreversibility of his death became clear to him and that he resisted it . Rather it is what the body does once it knows it is dying . It takes over the mind and all the God and science within it and becomes its own beast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on pavement after rain . For the reaction of that which is alive when faced with the death ever awaiting it like an old man in black with his hand out is to run and flee , shriek , panic , pull at that which kills it , fight death off , reduced to a frantic shameful critter in the wild . <p> He took the stepladder one hour ago from the side of the garage where his mother would park the Escort when she came home , removing first the sloppy tangled garden hose caked with old chunks of mud and then the dusty golf clubs on which the hose had been tossed . It is his father 's and is metal  --  thin and aluminum with brown rust in the joints where it unfolds and in the nuts and in the grips of the steps . Now the stepladder lies on its side , still opened . The routous clanging so silenced now . Grayson 's eyeballs red . The rope sinking into the fleshy underside of his chin , the browning flesh swelling up around it like risen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the garage , white and coiled and untouched since the day his father bought it at Hechinger and hung it there . He weighs 145 pounds , alive . He walked here from his house carrying the things of his deceasing . A distance of a quarter of a mile . His brain is still alive though it is without worth as blood has been denied it for over eleven minutes . His brain is the mulch , is the shoes he wears . The tip of a deep red tongue protruding between two thin nearly colorless lips . His hands hang at his sides . His small feet point down . The rim is durable  --  two rims welded together , one on top of the other , to form one thick rim off which the ball bounces drastically when shot , mandating perfection or nothing . The purpose is to defend against kids who might bend it by pulling themselves up by the net and hanging off it , doing chin-ups . Its pole too thick to wrap your arms all the way around , painted dark green but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the top like a capsized J. Some kids can still shimmy up it regardless . Grayson Donald has never been the sort to climb . Climbing is genetic . One of the biggest reliefs in his life came the first day he walked into gym class at Braddock Park High School and saw none of the climbing ropes that hung from the corner vaults at Catholic school . The rim is strong . It did not offer so much as a creak in protest to the demands his body made upon it without warning eleven minutes ago . There is no one else other than he named with his name in Centreville . There are between twelve and fifteen kids his age named Chris . Ten different Brians , four Bryans , eight Ryans , eleven Matts , seven David or Daves . In his confirmation class when he was fourteen there were three Tims and they all chose the name Joseph . The girls tend to be named Lindsay , Jennifer , Katie/Katherine , or one of the variations on Christine , Kristine , Christina , or Kristina , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edges of the court and they are brown and thin . Not long ago they were sussurant and green in the branches of trees . Earlier before he arrived two sixth graders named Chris and Ryan wearing baseball caps with professional sports team logos on them sped down the path , in the opposite direction that Grayson would soon move in , on expensive new Diamondbacks with pegs on the rear wheels , not using their brakes , hopping off any mounds or obstacles before them , speeding home before nightfall from lighting matches and burning leaves and sticks in another set of woods behind the school . Before that there were people wearing barn jackets and walking golden retrievers , plastic grocery bags stuffed in their pockets , here and there a jogger , a mother pushing a stroller speaking to the baby within as though the infant were herself . After the boys there was nobody until Grayson . The tot lot and basketball court are on a plateau rising up in the center of a drainage ditch that when full has Canadian geese floating atop it honking like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The slopes become part of the game . The drainage ditch has a concrete nuke silo sticking out from it . And there is a wrought iron ladder that you can climb down to go into it and light matches and burn things that you might find on the way gathering them up like a glacier and you can be unseen by the adults who look out their windows and wander their bike paths , indeed go about their days and lives with no object other than catching children crouched in woods and sewers burning things . Also in the silo are the several mouths of tunnels extending out from it in all directions like arteries from the heart and if you are a child and crouch down far enough you can crawl through the underworld . Deep within these sewer labyrinths is the best place to light matches and burn your debris . Venture in only if it has not rained and bring a flashlight and a pocketknife for cutting things you might find if you still have yours from Boy Scouts . On all sides around the dead kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portable basketball hoops . They circle him at a distance like wolves . If his eyes were open he would see the lights in the windows like eyes and shadows within rising from kitchen tables and carrying dishes to the sink , rinsing them for the dishwasher , glancing out the window at the wooded area behind their home that they pay an extra lot fee for , the value of the home rising and dropping , they can hear the ticking on the quietest nights like this one . Domestic living . The things of family . Finger paintings on the fridge , three-foot baby gates in doorways to keep the dog out of the living room , the flashing spectral of televisions , the blue fanal of bulky beige computer monitors plugged into the tower with the ropelike cable of a parallel port . Floppy disks , filing cabinets . Recliners and living room sets , sofas torn by the cat . The darkness outside and the lights inside blinding them to the knowledge that outside dies a boy who lived among them but upon whom their eyes have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . They will sleep the night through with him dangling out there under the moon . They will bicker and eat and laugh and brush their teeth , read a few pages in bed . They will lie in darkness thinking about their lives and deaths . In the morning a fifteen-year-old girl named Lindsay Martinez who goes to his school but does not know him will be putting on her bra , hair still wet and sticking to her back , the pink lace curtains of her bedroom window tied open , soccer trophies and academic achievement certificates from elementary school and middle school tacked to the wall , vinyl blinds twisted open , " Torn " by Natalie Imbruglia playing on Z104 on her Aiwa stereo with CD/tape/AM/FM radio and detachable speakers and remote control and digital screen that scrolls the station number across it , staring at herself in the mirror of her vanity as she blow-dries her hair , singing along in undertone but so sleepy at 6:30 am , dazed and mentally checking that she did n't forget to do any homework , decided that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like Carson Daly only cuter and who wears Samba Classics , the kind of shoes she wears , and she senses something is off and her eyes move to the window and she sees out over her backyard then the playground and sparse woods , the trees naked and spindle-shanked , and the basketball court , and her hand with the brush in it stops halfway through her hair , her head bent sideways so the hair hangs , the hair dryer still going , hot air on her face she does not feel . She squints . She straightens her head . She says ,  --  Oh my God . <p> In his stomach is chewed-up , partially digested baked ziti and masticated steamed vegetables and what was recently a dinner roll with margarine on it , and Coke . It is now all a pinkish mush in there . This is the second time this week that his stomach has held such contents . His mother makes baked ziti for dinner on average twice a week . She makes chicken three times a week . Normally it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant rice on the side . It is not uncommon for families in Little Rocky Run to set a designated hour of the evening as the time when all members must be home and seated to eat dinner together at the table in the kitchen . Six o'clock is usually this time . The Donalds do not eat together as a family at the same time every day . Dinnertime at the Donalds ' is whenever Grayson 's mother finally comes home and puts the baked ziti in the oven or covers the chicken that has been defrosting in the sink in Shake ' n Bake . Domino 's is ordered every Friday . Grayson normally is the one who places the order if he is home , as his father does not like telephones . Two large pepperonis , two two-liters of Coke . With frozen baked ziti you can drive home from work and take it out of the freezer and unpeel the foil and stick it in the oven before even putting down your purse , and with chicken you can rinse the pieces in the sink and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shake ' n Bake with the Shake ' n Bake in it and shake the bag , covering the chicken in crumbs , and put the chicken on a cookie sheet with tinfoil underneath if the Teflon coating has worn away and toss it into the oven before the cold-eyed fatigue of your unending days at last consumes you and your marrowbones turn to jelly upon seeing the sofa and the television just sitting there all for you like a valley of flowers and furry animals . And the ziti and chicken can be cooked and cooled by the time your husband and child begin prowling forth out of their warrens drooling and unforthcoming , sniffing around the kitchen like hyenas for food . <p> The baked ziti in his stomach now is being broken down by enzymes and acids and moving inch by inch into the intestines . He cooked it himself today , reading the instructions on the back of the package . His lunch was not eaten in the Braddock Park High School cafeteria at 9:57 this morning , the first lunch period . If it were any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been spaghetti , chopped into inch-long bits and covered in a dark red lump goop and eaten with a spork . His lunch has already made its way through the intestine and colon and now takes the form of hot brown shit cooling in the sagging seat of his Hanes boxer briefs . A hard-on protrudes from the crotch of his cargo pants . The cargo pants are very long and baggy and worn low on the hips , the common way of wearing any kind of pants in 1998 if you are a teenager , regardless of your race . There is also a substantial amount of Sprite in his stomach and digested Mountain Dew in his bladder . There is no water in his stomach . The only water he has consumed today was that which he accidentally swallowed while brushing his teeth this morning . If it were n't for the hard-on the bladder would be emptied , creating a large dark stain in the khaki and a drip down his left leg and small pool on the court below stinking like iodine . In his blood is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benzodiazepines . There is mostly caffeine and sugar . No sertraline or paroxetine or anything similar . No traces of the LSD he did when he was fourteen , not even in his spinal fluid . They said to test you for LSD they tap your spine because that 's where it goes . No alcohol . No common opioids . His body is warm to the touch with no rigor present . The eyelids are without special note . The conjunctivas and scleras are unremarkable . The corneas are cloudy . The irises are hazel . The pupils are equally dilated and fixed centrally . The skeleton of the nose is intact . The lip and frenulum are atraumatic . The teeth are natural and in good repair . Abundant edema fluid mixed with blood-tinged purge fluid emanates from the nose and mouth . There is a ligature mark around the neck with a suspension point at the back of the neck . There will be a small laceration on the back of the head when he hits his head when he is cut down . There will be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the neck from the noose . No marks on the hands or wrists . His fingernails cut very short . The toenails are short and clean . The back and buttocks are without special note . The scalp hair is nearly black and overgrown into a helmet of hair that with his beardless face makes you realize how so very young this person is . <p> Little Rocky Run in Centreville is twenty-five miles west of Washington , DC . The mailing address here is Clifton , the neighboring wealthy quaint bourg in the hills that looks frozen in the antebellum , manses on sprawling plots , a gravel road dollhouse hamlet , deep woods and lakes , old ghost railroad tracks . The quirk is a remnant of the origins of Little Rocky Run when the planners endeavored to market their vicinage to potential residents and did so by suggesting it was located in the desirable and historic Clifton , where Clarence Thomas lives , and that by living in Little Rocky Run you could be more or less living in that idyllic storybook place as well and could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the honeysuckles with your children . Also neighboring Centreville on another side is Manassas , the garish apartment city of malls and fast food places , red lights , car dealerships , lost causes , the middling gray hole of dropouts and divorce . Grayson Donald grew up here in Little Rocky Run in Centreville , mailing address Clifton . His family moved in twelve years ago from Northern California . They bought the home from Tyler Nickerson , a real estate agent still working in Little Rocky Run exclusively who has sold a good portion of the homes here . The home was still being built when the Donalds bought it . All homes on the street were . Grayson wandered through them as a little boy . The air smelled like the third layer of the earth . Migrant workers , their discarded Gatorade bottles and caulking tubes , all that sod rolled up in balls atop the orange dirt , the tar wet and ditches filled with quicksand , loose nails everywhere . All in upheaval . Stray articles of clothing , dormant yellow machines on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mud . Collected loose nails in his pockets . Little Rocky Run spreads for miles off Union Mill Road where Civil War trenches line the shoulder . A featureless desert of tract homes and new minimanses jammed among each other just going for a thousand acres of well-groomed yards and colorful landscaping and doorbells and 25 mph signs  --  lives being lived and nothing in the way . There is an elementary school , Twin Lakes Elementary , in the middle of all of this like the church in an Olde English village . In 1998 it overflows beyond capacity and there are plans for a middle school to be built up on Union Mill Road . There are School Zone signs almost everywhere . They pop up nearly a mile away from Twin Lakes Elementary . Stop signs . Children in bikes zoom around . To get anywhere you need a car . There is enough money and no worry about rent or eating . There are commuter jobs and swim teams and braces and standards for how long your grass can be . You will get a note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in need of repainting . Tennis courts , swimming pools , rec centers , retirement funds , report cards , hills , driveways , mailboxes , wood fences , gardens , wind chimes , aluminum baseball bats , video games , Rollerblades , garages , faux brick , blue Southern skies , Blue Ridge Mountains in the distance , Courts and Drives and Ways and Terraces and Circles , a baby factory , a breeding ground , all excess elements of living trimmed away like the hair of the mothers for the sake of creating and raising babies and maintaining the health , physical safety , and education of all , and little else is of value if it is not work or school or doctor appointments . <p> Off Union Mill Road there are four entrances into Little Rocky Run . At each a rock with a plaque attached to it and the words Little Rocky Run engraved in curvy script and the image of what looks like the side of a mountain . You refer to where you live by which entrance you use  --  the First Entrance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Third Entrance . Technically the numbers are wrong as there is an entrance before the First Entrance but for some reason no one counts this entrance . The First Entrance is where the oldest homes of Little Rocky Run are and also the cheapest and smallest . The Fourth Entrance contains the prefab quasi manors approaching the million-dollar mark already in 1998 . Braddock Park High School sits across from the First Entrance on the other side of Union Mill Road backing into Braddock Park and Twin Lakes Golf Course . It has three thousand students in 1998 . Trailer classrooms crowd the grounds like mold growth . When it 's autumn and perfect like tonight and the trees are bare you can see the high school from the elementary school . There are two swimming pools in Little Rocky Run not counting the smaller one by the town houses which is where the uncounted true first entrance is and where the homes were first built and are sold most cheaply . There are seventeen tennis courts in Little Rocky Run . This is the only tot lot that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pools does have a basketball court . How many tot lots there are in total no one can know for sure . Their numbers and nature are forever in flux . They are like the stars above you . This tot lot is in the Third Entrance . The fathers are in the military . They are here because the army , the air force has stationed them to one of the countless government offices scattered around Northern Virginia far enough away from one another that no single bomb or missile would wipe all of them out . The CIA headquarters in Langley . The Pentagon in Arlington . Several others unmarked and unknown . These are greige ziggurats of bureaucracy and secrecy . Fifteen miles east is Foxstone Park in Vienna where the spy Robert Hanssen , who works with some of these fathers in the FBI , meets his KGB handler with a briefcase of documents . Most fathers make the commute every morning with seldom more than a vague emotion of complaint . Men and women of duty . The fathers who are not military are civilian contractors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the research of the design of weapons systems , develop fuel cells and the technology of military action . Or they work for Mobil in a middle-management capacity , transferred to that entity 's corporate offices . Or they are at AOL in Dulles . They are here because of work . Work is why they breathe this air . The mothers are brilliant too . They have large butts and short hair and wear jeans pulled high with T-shirts bought on vacation tucked into them . The fathers wear sweaters , boat shoes without socks , short hair , nice watches . It is a time before Lasik surgery . The era of DSL and VHS . Definition is not high . The HBOs stop at number three . MTV plays some videos . Clinton is in office , there is no such thing yet of something called 9/11 . There is nothing that is called a text message . Hybrid engines can be found only in academic science journals . Blog is but an onomatopoeia  --  the sound of humanity about to sneeze . It is calm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1998 in Little Rocky Run save for the two former NFL players who live here  --  disgraced former placekicker Steve North and former Washington Redskins legend Donnie Warren , who hangs out in a lawn chair at his sons ' Little League games at Carlburn Field signing autographs . <p> No one can say for sure why it is spelled that way , with the r and the e reversed . We have our theories . One is that it is left over from the English who originally founded the township in the 1700s . It is even said that John Smith had a hand in its finding on his journeys up and down the East Coast in the first years of the 1600s battling the epic blade of Powhatan , the Salvage king . Though it 's easy to dispute this if you know the first thing about the general history of Virginia and Smith , one can still see the little pigeon-toed footprints of Pocahontas stamped in the soil along the Civil War trenches preserved by dictate of the Commonwealth on Union Mill Road . Her phantom perfumes wafting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them craters of the moon seen from the earth . And John Smith 's following after , big and booted . Imagine the daughter of Powhatan sneaking through the woodland to the tent of the enemy , the nubile Salvage princess dozing nude in the captain 's tent , shadows from the fire flickering over her shoulders . Smith outside crouched in the dirt picking tobacco from his teeth and cleaning his pistol , his men among him , drinking and smoking , all their balls save his swollen to the size of volleyballs after years of wandering the dankness of this black wilderness without God in it , nudging their leader in the ribs for details , Smith fighting a grin beneath his natty beard and ignoring them , when out doth come she , her hair mussed , eyes puffy from sleep , wrapped in the skin of a bear , floating like Ophelia out of the tent and past them , their conversation stopping and their eyes following her , all silent and staring up at her , the moon on their faces , or it 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water and letting the bearskin drop to the mud and wading into the river like a baptism or a suicide . <p> The township was n't officially incorporated until the Civil War . It is said that the first shot  --  the spark that ignited the conflagration  --  was discharged here . Until then Centreville consisted of three or four farms and those who worked them . And that was it . We can assume there was some sort of post office . A corner of somebody 's pantry perhaps . Which brings us to another plausible theory of the spelling of Centreville  --  that the man in charge of the paperwork necessary to incorporate the township with the Commonwealth was inebriated at the time he was filling out all the forms . Or he had a brain fart as he wrote what he meant to be Centerville . Or he was simply pretentious . He thought perhaps that since the English , the fashion trendsetters and world dominators of the earth  --  i.e. , the U.S.  --  of the era did things like stick u 's all over the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that too in the spelling of something so important as an incorporated township of the Confederacy . Also he may have been doing this paperwork on Manassas Battlefield as cannonballs whizzed by his ear and craniums exploded their brains all over the side of his face , making it difficult to concentrate . <p> After the war was done and all the bodies buried and the blood in the ground was dried up and blown off in flakes by the wind , and the freed Negroes were sent off their plantations to be ghettoed in Chicago and Detroit and all over the country , in every manner of speaking , and the 1800s turned into the 1900s and the car was invented and the population of Northern Virginia blossomed from ten thousand to over one million , as the 1950s mutated into the warped madness of the earth at the end of the millennium , the people who moved in and began to spawn themselves were n't Southern enough to call themselves Southerners but were n't Northern enough to be called Yankees either . They lost their twangs but still said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the North . They were reserved and conscious of themselves like they were in the North though they still hung rebel flags in the rear windows of their trucks . They were n't wealthy nor were they poor . They were famous for no particular type of food . Their weather was hot in the summer but not as hot as Mississippi or Louisiana . The winters were cold but not nearly as cold as the winters of Maine or Vermont . The springs were pleasant and the falls picturesque . What was left when all was washed away was a pink-fresh nobody , white people with occupations called things like Senior Marketing Data Information Analysis Coordinator , making low six figures in pharmaceutical sales by their thirtieth birthday . They drank Miller Lite and drove midrange sedans . Half voted Republican , half voted Democrat . The music they listened to was played at a low volume in the car on the commute , the mix station , whatever was on , the open-format rock stations floundering until giving up and switching over , the country stations , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they chose played the same four songs on repeat because they were songs they enjoyed . And they went to the gym after work and met their friends for happy hour and slept with their friends with condoms and became married at age twenty-seven and purchased a home and ventured forth in procreation . They had no structure to their faces . Their bones morphed into one another . They spoke the same syllables on top of one another , and they were cast out in the middle where they tore the plastic off their new shirts and tossed them in the washer in the year 1998 . <p> You think as you die . These are backroom , fleeting thoughts . It is the kind of thinking one does while shoveling out one 's car or scrubbing the burned stuck bits of canned croissants off a cookie sheet whose nonstick coating has baked away over the years . Silly and rampant thoughts released from the abyssal crevices of the cerebrum like the cerebrum 's been soaking in detergent , like in a commercial , the screen split and your brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the leading brand on the other side , your dreams and vague ideas and subconscious desires floating up from the socks through the water . See the difference ? <p> It 's a lot like dreaming . Your limbs flailing , your arteries contracting like the mouths of unguinous baby birds , your heart in emergency mode , pushing itself high into the red to fight for its every last beat , and all the while you are thinking , Did I pay my cable bill ? Or , I did n't buy anything for Mother 's Day . Or , what 's today ? Tuesday ? Random , flickering but highly specific images that must mean something or come from somewhere but at first glance appear not to . A trumpet with mistletoe around it . What is it and where did it come from ? As for Grayson Donald , this is what he thought about as he died : a great idea for a new kind of thermometer . They should invent a thermometer , he thought , that one can stick outside one 's window that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is outside , a number that can mean nothing if there is a cold wind or a high humidity , it tells you what kind of clothing you should wear today . For example it might say , HEAVY JACKET AND HAT AND THERMALS or SHIRT AND LONG PANTS BUT MAYBE BRING A SWEATER TOO . A more expensive model will include a moisture sensor and it will also be able to say UMBRELLA . If somebody were to revolutionize the thermometer in such a way , he thought , he would make millions . He might go down in history . The majority of human beings would pay you to tell them what to wear every day , sure . It is a daily challenge that no one since the first weatherman has thought to address . Take an obstacle out of people 's mornings . This is the basic principle of business . The interpretation of numerical data  --  they will pay to have that done for them . They will line up for it . You 'd probably go down in the annals of history . Though the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . Unless his name was Thermometer . Greek guy . Socrates and Thermometer hanging out in Athens in their tunics . No  --  meter means measure , thermo means temperature . Would n't it be a hoot if that were his name though anyway  --  talk about being into it . This thermometer though , Grayson thought , huge spots of eclipsing fanal exploding before his sight , the rope tearing his flesh , kicking and seizing , will save countless people from getting sick from being underdressed after trying to decide if 42 degrees is too warm for the heavy jacket . It will also save them from irritability and even heatstroke from being overdressed on surprisingly warm days . People will feel better overall and more cheerful and comfortable . Imagine a city filled only with that kind of person . Tolerant of the slow and lost on the road , pleasant and nonperspirant on crowded trains . Crime rates will drop , the general mood of humanity will improve . War will end . Poverty will disappear . A love train across the universe . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product threaten the mental health industry ( a booming industry ) and big pharmaceutical enough that they will take action to ... remove the inventor of the new thermometer before it can hit the market ? Would he begin to find threatening notes in his mailbox made from the cutout letters of newspapers ? Hear the sound of sticks breaking in his backyard at night ? Feel the need to get down on his belly in his driveway every morning and take a peek at the ol ' undercarriage ? He considered that this could be precisely why the thermometer has remained the same ( aside from the invention of the digital thermometer  --  oooh , Pfizer 's really shaking in their wingtips ! ) for so long , just like the umbrella . Thousands of years probably . No new take on the technology has been made or least marketed because thugs have a death grip on the market , arresting the development of the thermometer . There is maybe a secret sect of high-powered vested parties . They live among us . Mercury distributors , little glass tube makers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dashes . And so on . Think about it . Who else would buy mercury if thermometers stopped needing it ? Though digital thermometers do n't use mercury . Must have been a deal of some sort there . Kickbacks . The answer to any question in America is a one-word answer : Money . Why did the Founding Fathers declare independence ? Money . Why are the Rolling Stones still at it ? Money . Then he thought , I should eat fish more often . It 's an entire genre of food I have thus far neglected all the time eating baked ziti and Shake ' n Bake chicken . In fish there 's probably a whole new world of gustatory experience out there . It will change how I perceive everything . <p> Then he kicked once more , shat his pants , and died . <p> The same freakish meeting of the right ions and chemicals and temperatures that mashed together in the collision that gave us life on earth  --  the perfect levels of fluoride in the water , the right amount of iron in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction of the wind blowing the delicate wafts of toxic emissions from downtown Washington , DC , factories where children of the slaves stabbed one another and black women accepted white cocks into their siccaneous and trembling mouths and old Hispanic men quivered in methadone clinic lines six hours deep , mixed with illegal dumping in the Potomac where condoms floated in the current and oil slicks on Chesapeake crab backs . It all blended to form a cloud that slid west and met with the humidity and spent buckshot cartridges and Civil War bones clad in blue and gray to create concrete and vinyl siding and front yards laid in chunks , child care centers and video rental places . One day there were dirt roads and horses and the next there was one of the biggest counties in America , Fairfax County , hallowed be its name . A barricaded oasis severe and new in a state known for its tobacco and NRA meetings and its agomphious inbreeding . Isolationists hiding in the Blue Ridges in their meth lab trailers with wall safes stashed with weed and coke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stark if one were to drive thirty minutes south or west . One world ends and another begins . It 's like there 's a chalk line drawn and  --  BOOM  --  people have accents and spouses in prison and sores from picking their face , eight or nine cigarettes hanging out of their mouth , Natty Light deuce-deuce in one hand and a losing scratch-off ticket in the other . In Northern Virginia no one really smokes . The cost of cigarettes is a full dollar higher than anywhere else in the state where in 1998 a pack of Camel Lights costs around $2.50 . No one smokes in NoVA except for teenagers and middle-aged men at Fourth of July parties if they 've had four Bud Lights and their wives are n't looking . Gas prices are way higher too . Do n't even ask about traffic . There is nothing but traffic . It 's second only to L.A. The planners must have had a hard-on for traffic . Public transportation sucks if you 're outside the Beltway . You have to drive . On 66 East around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into NoVA from the boonies and things EXPLODE . 66 is the main artery of NoVA . It 's like the Jersey Turnpike . It goes right into DC . To get into DC from Centreville you get on 66 East and sputter along on someone 's bumper and someone else on your bumper going about 10 mph . You pass the Vienna Metro station and pass Falls Church , lurching and braking and drumming your fingers on the wheel to DC101 or Z104 keeping your eyes straight or fiddling with the AC  --  anytime of day except maybe three in the morning there is this awful , unending constipated traffic  --  the traffic reaching its peak and all forward progress halting altogether as the Beltway approaches  --  famous and mighty , enigmatic and impossible to figure out which direction you need to go in because it 's a circle  --  north is south and south is east  --  and most cars veer off here to sit idle on the on-ramp and you can see the line of red brake lights snaking off in eternity and you 've never been more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to get on the Beltway . And as you pass the on-ramp something suddenly gives and all engines roar like at NASCAR , your car jumps forward , all brake lights vanish , as before you is CLEAR SAILING , the concrete soundproof walls on either side of you , the trees sticking out from over them , the Metro tracks running down between the west- and eastbound traffic , the HOV lane marked with a white diamond phasing out and after a while it chops down to two lanes and there is no stopping you . <p> The people of NoVA know 66 unconsciously . Like how the Salvages John Smith met knew how to grow victuals . They can cruise along 66 with a blindfold on and talking on their cell phone while programming their radio and hit their exit without even tapping their brakes . 66 is a walk down to the mailbox .
