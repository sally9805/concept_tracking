I know what you people want . You want someone to tell you what a tough year it was and what brave little soldiers you are for getting through it , wacky election and all . Or maybe you 're expecting cute little phrases to sum things up , like , " The Dawn of the New Millennium " or " History in Our Hands " or " The Year Anne Heche Went Nuts in Some Poor Woman 's House . " Well , I 'm not going to help you . You came to the wrong place . <P> The truth is , you had it easy this year . It was n't supposed to be this pleasant , and in the end it was n't supposed to be this much fun . After an endless barrage of millennium-eve , Bruckheimer-intense previews , what you got was a 180-min . Robert Redford-directed golf film with a surprise ending . <P> This was n't the way the script read . Remember how everything was going to go kooky when all those zeroes lined up in a row ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market crash , a Blade Runner world . But the lights never went out , and the sun came up in the morning . Then John McCain was going to win the nomination , the Red Sox were going to win the World Series , Marion Jones was going to win five gold medals and Tommy Lee was going to win Pamela Anderson 's heart back . No , no , no and no . Even when it seemed like something happened this year , it did n't . Elian looked at Disney World and went back home . We kept our Miranda rights . Those missing top-secret computer hard drives at Los Alamos were behind the copy machine . Nobody , it turned out , married a multi-millionaire . <P> The Microsoft breakup ? Not yet . Middle East peace ? Not hardly . The Oxygen network ? Jack Welch 's retirement ? Heck , Jesus was supposed to show up . <P> What we got instead was a year so copacetic , Neville Chamberlain could have handled it ( at least for the first 10 months ) . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the globe staged protests over higher gas prices and trade-group meetings . <P> This was our own fault : we had put way too much pressure on the new millennium . We 'd been getting geared up for the year 2000  --  a year so special we put the phrase " the year " in front of it  --  for a long , long time . It was 1982 when Prince released a song predicting nuclear armageddon or a really good party  --  depending on how you read it  --  on New Year 's Eve , 1999 . It was 1993 when Conan O'Brien started his " In the Year 2000 " segment ( " In the year 2000 Roger Ebert will be so overweight and out of shape , he will no longer be able to lift either thumb . " ) . Everyone was getting all hot and bothered . Even castrated people were getting so excited that , by 1997 , a whole group of them in California decided they could n't wait any longer and left our soon-to-explode planet early . By 1999 , Pat Robertson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to store beans and corn in separate barrels sealed with nitrogen packs . He apparently figured God had traded in fire and brimstone for the more subtle New Year 's computer bug .
