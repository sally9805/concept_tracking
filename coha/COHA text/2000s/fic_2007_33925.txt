Chapter One In the spring of the year that I was supposed to be married , a comet launched itself over the skies of my village . It was brighter than any comet we had ever seen , and more evil . Night after night , as it crawled across our skies spraying its cold white seeds of sorrow , we tried to decipher the fearsome messages of the stars . Hajj Ali , the most learned man in our village , traveled to Isfahan to fetch a copy of the chief astronomer 's almanac so we would know what calamities to expect . The evening he returned , the people of my village began assembling outside to listen to the predictions for the months ahead . My parents and I stood near the old cypress , the only tree in our village , which was decorated with strips of cloth marking people 's vows . Everyone was looking upward at the stars , their chins pointing toward the sky , their faces grave . I was small enough to see under Hajj Ali 's big white beard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My mother , Maheen , pointed at the Sunderer of Heads , which burned red in the night sky . " Look how Mars is inflamed ! " she said . " That will add to the comet 's malice . " Many of the villagers had already noticed mysterious signs or heard of misfortunes caused by the comet . A plague had struck the north of Iran , killing thousands of people . An earthquake in Doogabad had trapped a bride in her home , suffocating her and her women guests moments before she was to join her groom . In my village , red insects that had never been seen before had swarmed over our crops . Goli , my closest friend , arrived with her husband , Ghasem , who was much older than we were . She greeted me with a kiss on each cheek . " How are you feeling ? " I asked . Her hand flew to her belly . " Heavy , " she replied , and I knew she must be worried about the fate of the new life inside her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except for the old and the infirm . Most of the women were wearing bright bell-shaped tunics over slim trousers , with fringed head scarves over their hair , while the men were attired in long white tunics , trousers , and turbans . But Hajj Ali wore a black turban , indicating his descent from the Prophet Mohammad , and carried an astrolabe wherever he went . " Good villagers , " he began , in a voice that sounded like a wheel dragging over stones , " let us begin by heaping praise on the first followers of the Prophet , especially upon his son-in-law Ali , king of all believers . " " May peace be upon him , " we replied . " This year 's predictions begin with poor news for our enemies . In the northeast , the Ozbaks will suffer an infestation of insects so fierce it will destroy their wheat . In the northwest , troop desertions will plague the Ottomans , and even farther west , in the Christian kingdoms , inexplicable diseases will disarrange the lips of kings . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's always good to know that the countries we 're fighting are going to have miserable luck . " We laughed together , since that 's how it always was . As Hajj Ali continued reading from the almanac , my heart skipped as if I were climbing a mountain . I was wondering what he would say about marriages made during the year , which was what I cared about the most . I began fiddling with the fringe on my head scarf , a habit my mother always urged me to break , as Hajj Ali explained that no harm would come to paper , books , or the art of writing ; that earthquakes would occur in the south but would be mild ; and that there would be battles great enough to tinge the Caspian Sea red with blood . Hajj Ali waved the almanac at the crowd , which is what he did when the prediction he was about to read was alarming . His assistant , who was holding an oil lamp , jumped to move out of his way . " Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large and inexplicable lapses in moral behavior this year , " he read , " lapses that can only be explained by the influence of the comet . " A low murmur came from the crowd as people began discussing the lapses they had already witnessed in the first days of the New Year . " She took more than her share of water from the well , " I heard Zaynab say . She was Gholam 's wife , and never had a good word to say about anyone . Hajj Ali finally arrived at the subject that concerned my future . " On the topic of marriages , the year ahead is mixed , " he said . " The almanac says nothing about those that take place in the next few months , but those contracted later this year will be full of passion and strife . " I looked anxiously at my mother , since I expected to be married at that time , now that I was already fourteen . Her eyes were troubled , and I could see she did not like what she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the almanac , looked up , and paused , the better to capture the crowd 's attention . " This final prophecy is about the behavior of women , and it is the most disquieting of all , " he said . " Throughout the year , the women of Iran will fail to be acquiescent . " " When are they ever ? " I heard Gholam say , and laughter bubbled around him . My father smiled at my mother , and she brightened from within , for he loved her just the way she was . People always used to say that he treated her as tenderly as if she were a second wife . " Women will suffer from their own perverse behavior , " Hajj Ali warned . " Many will bear the curse of sterility , and those who succeed in giving birth will wail in unusual pain . " My eyes met Goli 's , and I saw my own fear reflected in hers . Goli was worried about childbirth , while I was troubled by the thought of a disorderly union . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave us undisturbed . Seeing me shiver , my father wrapped a lamb 's wool blanket over my shoulders , and my mother took one of my hands between hers and rubbed it to warm me . From where I stood in the center of my village , I was surrounded by the familiar sights of home . Not far away was our small mosque , its dome sparkling with tile ; the hammam where I bathed every week , steamy inside and dappled with light ; and the scarred wooden stalls for the tiny market that sprang up on Thursdays , where villagers traded fruit , vegetables , medicines , carpets , and tools . A path led away from the public buildings and passed between a cluster of mud-brick homes that sheltered all two hundred souls in my village , and it ended at the foot of the mountain and the rutted paths where my goats roamed for food . All these sights filled me with comfort , so that when my mother squeezed my hand to see how I was feeling , I squeezed back . But then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seem like a child . " Baba , " I whispered to my father in a small voice . " What if Hajj Ali 's predictions about marriage come true ? " My father could n't hide the concern in his eyes , but his voice was firm . " Your husband will pave your path with rose petals , " he replied . " If at any time , he fails to treat you with honor ... " He paused for a moment , and his dark eyes looked fierce , as if what he might do were too terrible to imagine . He started to say something , but then stopped himself . " ... you can always come back to us , " he finished . Shame and blame would follow a wife who returned to her parents , but my father did n't seem to care . His kind eyes crinkled at the corners as he smiled at me . Hajj Ali concluded the meeting with a brief prayer . Some of the villagers broke off into family groups to discuss the predictions , while others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she wanted to talk , but her husband told her it was time to go home . She whispered that her feet ached from the weight in her belly and said good night . My parents and I walked home on the single mud lane that pierced the village . All the dwellings were huddled together on either side for warmth and protection . I knew the path so well I could have walked it blind and turned at just the right moment to reach our house , the last one before our village gave way to sand and scrub . My father pushed open our carved wooden door with his shoulders , and we entered our one-room home . Its walls were made of packed mud and straw brightened with white plaster , which my mother kept sparkling clean . A small door led to an enclosed courtyard where we enjoyed the sun without being seen by other eyes . My mother and I removed our head scarves and placed them on hooks near the door , slipping off our shoes at the same time . I shook out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck , I touched the curved ibex horns that glowed on a low stand near the door . My father had felled the ibex on one of our Friday afternoon walks . Ever since that day , the horns had held a position of pride in our household , and my father 's friends often praised him for being as nimble as an ibex . My father and I sat together on the red-and-brown carpet I had knotted when I was ten . His eyes closed for a moment , and I thought he looked especially tired . " Are we walking tomorrow ? " I asked . His eyes flew open . " Of course , my little one , " he replied . He had to work in the fields in the morning , but he insisted he would n't miss our walk together for anything other than God 's command . " For you shall soon be a busy bride , " he said , and his voice broke . I looked away , for I could n't imagine leaving him . My mother threw dried dung in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a surprise , " she said , bringing us a plate of fresh chickpea cookies . They were fragrant with the essence of roses . " May your hands never ache ! " my father said . They were my favorite sweets , and I ate far too many of them . Before long , I became tired and spread out my bedroll near the door , as I always did . I fell asleep to the sound of my parents talking , which reminded me of the cooing of doves , and I think I even saw my father take my mother in his arms and kiss her . THE NEXT AFTERNOON , I stood in our doorway and watched for my Baba as the other men streamed back from the fields . I always liked to pour his tea for him before he walked in the door . My mother was crouched over the stove , baking bread for our evening meal . When he did n't arrive , I went back into the house , cracked some walnuts and put them in a small bowl , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . Then I went out to look again , for I was eager to begin our walk . Where was he ? Many of the other men had returned from the fields and were probably washing off the day 's dust in their courtyards . " We need some water , " my mother said , so I grabbed a clay jug and walked toward the well . On my way , I ran into Ibrahim the dye maker , who gave me a peculiar look . " Go home , " he said to me . " Your mother needs you . " I was surprised . " But she just told me to fetch water , " I said . " No matter , " he replied . " Tell her I told you to go back . " I walked home as quickly as I could , the vessel banging against my knees . As I approached our house , I spotted four men bearing a limp bundle between them . Perhaps there had been an accident in the fields . From time to time , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a threshing tool , suffered a kick from a mule , or returned bloodied from a fight . I knew he 'd tell us what had happened over tea . The men moved awkwardly because of their burden . The man 's face was hidden , cradled on one of their shoulders . I said a prayer for his quick recovery , for it was hard on a family when a man was too ill to work . As the group approached , I noticed that the victim 's turban was wrapped much like my father 's . But that did n't mean anything , I told myself quickly . Many men wrapped their turbans in a similar way . The front bearers got out of step for a moment , and they almost lost hold of the man . His head lolled as though it were barely attached to his body , and his limbs had no life in them . I dropped the clay vessel , which shattered around my feet . " Bibi , " I whimpered . " Help ! " My mother came outside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , she uttered a piercing wail . Women who lived nearby streamed out of their houses and surrounded her like a net while she tore the air with her sorrow . As she writhed and jumped , they caught her gently , holding her and stroking the hair away from her face . The men brought my father inside and laid him on a bedroll . His skin was a sickly yellow color , and a line of saliva slid out of the corner of his mouth . My mother put her fingers near his nostrils . " Praise be to God , he 's still breathing ! " she said . Naghee , who worked with my father in the fields , did n't know where to look as he told us what had happened . " He seemed tired , but he was fine until this afternoon , " he said . " Suddenly he grabbed his head and fell to the ground , gasping for air . After that , he did n't stir . " " May God spare your husband ! " said a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could to make him comfortable , they left , murmuring prayers for good health . My mother 's brow was furrowed as she removed my father 's cotton shoes , straightened his tunic , and arranged the pillow under his head . She felt his hands and forehead and declared his temperature normal , but told me to fetch a blanket and cover him to keep him warm . The news about my father spread quickly , and our friends began arriving to help . Kolsoom brought the water she had collected from a spring near a saint 's shrine that was known for its healing powers . Ibrahim took up a position in the courtyard and began reciting the Qur'an . Goli came by , her boy asleep in her arms , with hot bread and stewed lentils . I brewed tea to keep the warmth in everyone 's body . I knelt near my father and watched his face , praying for a flutter of his eyelids , even a grimace-anything that would assure me life remained in his body . Rabi'i , the village physician , arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slung on each shoulder . He laid them near the door and knelt to examine my father by the light of the oil lamp , which flickered brokenly . His eyes narrowed as he peered closely at my father 's face . " I need more light , " he said . I borrowed two oil lamps from neighbors and placed them near the bedroll . The physician lifted my father 's head and carefully unwound his white turban . His head looked heavy and swollen . In the light , his face was the color of ash , and his thick hair , which was flecked with gray , looked stiff and ashen , too . Rabi'i touched my father 's wrists and neck , and when he did not find what he was looking for , he laid his ear against my father 's chest . At that moment , Kolsoom asked my mother in a whisper if she would like more tea . The physician lifted his head and asked everyone to be silent , and after listening again , he arose with a grave face and announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Ali , prince among men , give strength to my husband ! " my mother cried . Rabi'i collected his bags and removed bunches of herbs , explaining to Kolsoom how to brew them into a heart-enlivening medicine . He also promised to return the next morning to check on my father . " May God rain His blessings on you ! " he said as he took his leave . Kolsoom began stripping the herbs off their stalks and throwing them into a pot , adding the water my mother had boiled . As Rabi'i left , he stopped to talk with Ibrahim , who was still in the courtyard . " Do n't halt your praying , " he warned , and then I heard him whisper the words " God may gather him tonight . " I tasted something like rust on my tongue . Seeking my mother , I rushed into her arms and we held each other for a moment , our eyes mirrors of sorrow . My father began to make wheezing sounds . His mouth was still slack , his lips slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the wind . My mother rushed away from the stove , her fingers green from the herbs . She leaned over my father and cried , " Voy , my beloved ! Voy ! " Kolsoom hurried over to peer at my father and then led my mother back to the stove , for there was nothing to be done . " Let us finish this medicine to help him , " said Kolsoom , whose ever-bright eyes and pomegranate cheeks testified to her powers as an herbalist . When the herbs had been boiled and cooled , Kolsoom poured the liquid into a shallow bowl and brought it to my father 's side . While my mother raised his head , Kolsoom gently spooned the medicine into his mouth . Most of it spilled over his lips , soiling the bedroll . On the next try , she got the medicine into his mouth , but my father sputtered , choked , and for a moment appeared to stop breathing . Kolsoom , who was usually so calm , put down the bowl with shaking hands and met my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes open before we try again , " she advised . My mother 's head scarf was askew , but she did n't notice . " He needs his medicine , " she said weakly , but Kolsoom told her that he needed his breath more . Ibrahim 's voice was starting to sound hoarse , and Kolsoom asked me to attend to him . I poured some hot tea and served it to him with dates in the courtyard . He thanked me with his eyes but never stopped his reciting , as if the power of his words could keep my father alive . (
