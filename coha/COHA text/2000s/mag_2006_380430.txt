I can drink beer out of my leg . How many people can do that ? " Specialist Matthew Braddock takes a breather from the pound of pork ribs he 's packing away to show off his prosthetic leg . The 25-year-old National Guardsman props his mechanical limb on the picnic table so everybody at Rudy 's Country Store and Bar-B-Q can see . Then he rolls up the sleeve of his battle-dress uniform and points to the long , wide , nasty scar left by the explosion that took his leg in northern Iraq a year ago . People come by afterward to slap him on the back and thank him for serving his country . No pity party here . " I live by the theory of suck it up . Why be negative ? " he says . " I can run faster now , and the chicks dig it . " <P> After a year of rehabilitation at the Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio , Texas , Braddock is driving his Jeep Wrangler home this week to Vancouver , Wash. , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buddies and try to get out of the Guard  --  not to leave the military but to join the Army . He wants to go back to Iraq , never mind the missing leg . After all , with its high-tech Renegade foot , his new one has made him faster and funnier . Why test fate a second time ? Because he loves the military , loves guns and loved his job as a scout . " I 'm going back to be a trigger puller , not a bullet catcher , " he says , reasoning that the odds of being blown up twice are pretty low . His mom , Rhetta Drennan , is worried but resigned , especially since her daughter is in the Army , in South Korea . " He 's happier . He 's found his direction in life , " she says . <P> When TIME printed Braddock 's picture last year , letters poured in from readers asking what had become of the young man photographed on a doctor 's examining table calmly inspecting the remains of his severed limb . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guardsmen come home from Iraq seeking treatment at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington , Brooke in San Antonio and veterans ' hospitals nationwide . Three years since the start of the war , the toll of seriously wounded from Iraq exceeds 7,600  --  men and women without limbs , with horrid burns , with brain damage , all of them dealing with the psychological scars of war . Braddock is just one of at least 345 who have had amputations  --  a higher rate per injury than in any other modern U.S. war . Most survivors , like Braddock , are left to pick up the pieces of their lives out of public view . But last month 's roadside bomb attack on ABC News co-anchor Bob Woodruff and his cameraman Doug Vogt put the war and the fate of the wounded back in the headlines  --  and more important , in our thoughts . <P> Braddock has had a year to live with his injuries and his new leg , which now sports a huge State of Washington seal . He calls the ugly seam where doctors sewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ankle , the one he was born with , gives him more problems than his prosthetic ankle . " I could take my shoe off to show you , " he offers , " but it takes an act of God to get it back on . " Then , while people around us are getting barbecue sauce all over their faces , he relives Jan. 13 , 2005 , the night he was on a scouting mission , driving a humvee near a railroad yard in Kirkuk , the oil capital of northern Iraq .
