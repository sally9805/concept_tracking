They are gassing us ! We really beg not to be gassed . We hope it will not be like the Kursk ! " As a thick , visible mist enveloped hostages and their takers in Moscow 's House of Culture theater , Anya cried for help through her cell phone . The hostage thought she was about to suffocate slowly just like the sailors trapped aboard the crippled Russian submarine Kursk in 2000 . " We see it , we feel it , we are breathing through our clothes . We are all going to be blown up ! " <P> But the fast-acting sleeping agent being pumped into the theater was the key ingredient in a daring rescue raid . As early as Day One of the hostage standoff , diggers had been tunneling underneath the theater in preparation for an assault . Now in the early hours of Saturday , gunshots from inside had forced into action the waiting Spetsnaz commando troops in the elite Alfa and Vympel antiterror units of the Federal Security Service . The Chechen hostage takers , it seemed , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if Russian President Vladimir Putin had not declared an end to the war in Chechnya by Saturday at dawn , they would start killing hostages . If they were assaulted , they made clear they were ready to blow up explosives plastered around the auditorium and strapped to their bodies . <P> But the rescue was precipitated by a small , unexpected act of impatience . After three days locked in the stuffy , smelly auditorium , an agitated young male hostage had had enough . According to one account , he threw a bottle at some of his Chechen captors and ran toward them . A gunman opened fire , missed the youth and hit another man in the eye . " There was blood  --  foamy . A girl was hit in the side , " said Olga Chernyak , an Interfax news reporter among the captives . " It happened right where I was . I thought they would kill us all . " As hostages screamed , recalled Chernyak , " The Chechen women were very happy the end was coming and that they would blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come here to die , and you will be going with us . " <P> The 200-man team from Alfa and Vympel were ordered to set the hostages free in two hours . They donned white armbands to distinguish themselves from the Chechens wearing similar camouflage suits . Then they injected the sleeping gas through the building 's ventilating system and holes bored underneath the auditorium , hoping to immobilize the gunmen and especially the explosive-laden women . A source close to the Alfa unit says that five times the required amount of gas was funneled in . " They used a lot , to be on the safe side , " he says . " They were well aware of the repercussions for them should the gas attack fail . " There was a shattering blast and the rattle of gunfire ; then the troops smashed through doors , shooting down hostage takers still capable of firing back . Spetsnaz shot sleeping suicide bombers in the temple at point-blank range . " When a person wears two kilos of plastic explosive , we did n't see any other way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team . Ringleader Movsar Barayev sprawled dead on his back on stage with a Cognac bottle  --  strangely  --  by his side .
