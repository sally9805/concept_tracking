Part I : Collision Course It was Thursday morning right before first period , and Phil was on a mission . Hurrying through the fourth- and fifth-grade hall , he waded through groups of younger kids . His little brother , Jimmy , had left the house early so he could ride to school with a friend , and he had left his lunch money on the kitchen counter . Phil was tall for a sixth grader , so most of the younger kids got out of his way . Which was good , because he had no time to mess around . If he got one more tardy during December , he would have to serve two detentions . The pressure made Phil 's imagination run at full throttle . Like , if I 'm late for math today , then I might not be allowed to take the test  --  and then I could flunk math ! I might even flunk sixth grade and get left back ! And when Mom and Dad yell at me , I 'm gon na get so mad , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I 'll say , " Hey , know what ? Forget about school , that 's what ! " And I 'll just drop out and turn into a bum  --  or maybe even a criminal . My whole life 's gon na be a mess , and it 's all on account of my stupid little brother ! Where is that punk ? Phil was about to stick his head into a classroom to look around . Then up at the corner of the hallway he thought he saw the back of his brother 's jacket . It had to be Jimmy . No one else in the whole city had a jacket like that one . He called , " Hey , Jimmy ! " but his brother did n't stop , and Phil pushed his way forward and rushed around the corner . " Hey , idiot , you forgot ... " But it was n't Jimmy . It was someone Phil had never seen before , a black kid . Wearing Jimmy 's jacket . Phil grabbed the collar and said , " Hey ! This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How 'd you get this from him ? " The other boy struggled , trying to pull away . " What 're you talkin ' about ? Let go of me ! This is my jacket ! I do n't even know your brother ! " The kid twisted and turned to break free , but Phil was a lot bigger and stronger . " You tell me where my brother 's at , or I 'm gon na  --  " " Boys ! You stop it , right now ! " Mrs. Atkin came striding through the crowd that had gathered , pushing kids out of her way with her left hand and pointing at Phil with the other one . " You let go of him , and I mean it ! " Drawn by Mrs. Atkin 's voice , three or four other teachers stepped out into the hallway . Phil let go of the jacket , and the younger boy jerked around to face him , his fists up , his eyes narrowed . Mrs. Atkin stepped between them and said to the younger boy , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of you kids , go on about your business . Get your things put away and get to your rooms . Go on , there 's nothing happening here . " Then , glaring at Phil and the smaller boy , she said , " You two , come with me . " The other teachers were moving around in the hallway now , talking to kids , quieting everyone down . Phil and Daniel followed Mrs. Atkin along the hall . And Phil knew where they were headed  --  straight to the office . He thought , Now I 'm gon na flunk out for sure . At the office door Mrs. Atkin stopped and herded the boys in ahead of her . " Mrs. Cormier ? Sorry to start your day like this , but I found these two going at it down in the fourth-grade hall . I 've got to get back to my room before something else breaks loose . " The principal still had her coat on from being out at the curb with the buses . She frowned at the boys and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . And I do n't want you two to even look at each other , is that clear ? " Both of them nodded and walked into her office . A minute later Mrs. Cormier came in and sat down behind her desk . She motioned to Phil , who had taken a chair against the wall . " Come over here and sit in front of me . I want to be able to look each of you in the eye . " Daniel kept looking straight ahead at Mrs. Cormier . When Phil was seated , she said , " Phil , you 've got no business being in the four-five hall in the morning . Why were you there ? " " My brother , Jimmy , forgot his lunch money . And I still have to give it to him . " Mrs. Cormier nodded . " All right , that makes sense . Here , " she said , putting out her hand , " give me his money , and I 'll make sure he gets it . " Phil dug in his pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them on her desk and then turned to the other boy . " Okay , Daniel , you first : What happened ? " " What happened is , I 'm talking with my friends , and this kid comes and grabs me and starts yelling at me . I 've never seen him before . I did n't do a thing ! " Mrs. Cormier turned to Phil . " Did you grab him , Phil ? " " Yeah , ' cause he stole my brother 's jacket ! That 's my old jacket , and now it 's my brother 's , and this kid stole it , so I grabbed him . " " Liar ! " Daniel jumped to his feet and faced Phil , his fists clenched . " I never stole a thing ! My gramma gave me this jacket for my birthday , and that 's the truth , so you stop saying that ! " " Daniel , " said Mrs. Cormier sharply , " you sit down and stay put ! " Mrs. Cormier swept her eyes between the boys . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is n't it possible that Daniel happens to have a jacket just like your brother 's ? " Phil shook his head forcefully . " No way . My mom bought that jacket when she went to Italy , and she brought it back for me . Go ahead , look at the label inside the neck . It 's gon na say ' Ricci di Roma . ' That 's because she got it in Rome . Go ahead and look . That 's my jacket . " Mrs. Cormier stood up and walked around to the front of her desk . " May I look at the label , Daniel ? " He shrugged and stuck his lower lip out . " I do n't care . ' Cause this is n't his jacket . " The principal gently pulled the collar of the jacket back , and then twisted her neck and adjusted her glasses . Her eyebrows shot up . " It says ' Ricci di Roma . ' " " See ? I told you so , " said Phil triumphantly . " He stole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " And if Mrs. Cormier had n't been on her feet to catch him , Daniel would have been on top of Phil , fists swinging . She pushed him back into his chair and shouted , " Silence ! Not another word , either of you ! " Calling to the secretary through the open door , she said , " Mrs. Donne ? Get me the emergency cards for Philip Morelli and Daniel Taylor , would you  --  right away . " Thirty seconds later Mrs. Cormier was dialing her phone , then smiling and speaking . " Mrs. Taylor ? This is Mrs. Cormier , the principal at Daniel 's school .... No , he 's fine , but there 's been a disagreement this morning , and he 's in the middle of it . It 's about a jacket , the one Daniel says he got for his birthday . Another boy is here , and he says the jacket belongs to him . Can you tell me anything else that might help ? ... Yes .... Oh . I see .... So it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's it , then . I 'm awfully sorry to have bothered you .... Yes , you too . Good-bye . " Daniel turned to Phil . " See ? I told you so . It was a gift  --  for me . " Mrs. Cormier said , " It turns out you 're both right , boys . Someone gave that jacket to your grandmother , Daniel , and then she gave it to you . " Phil made a face . " Gave it to his grandmother ? How come ? " Mrs. Cormier started to say something , then stopped , smiled awkwardly , and said , " Well , really , I ... I think it was just ... to be kind . That 's all . " Something registered in Phil 's mind , and his mouth dropped open . Turning to Daniel , he asked , " Who 's your grandma ? What 's her name ? " Daniel curled his lip . " None of your business . But her name 's Lucy . Lucy Taylor . " Phil 's face reddened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , okay ? You 're right . It 's your jacket . " " What ? " Daniel looked sideways at Phil , cocking his head as if he had n't heard clearly . " You come and almost pull this thing off my back , and now you say just keep it ? What 's that about ? " Phil looked at the floor . " It 's just that ... like , I think I know your grandma  --  that 's all . So the jacket 's yours . " Daniel frowned and narrowed his eyes . " You ? Know my gramma ? Right ! " He smiled , taunting Phil . " Yeah , like , how you gon na know my gramma ? Maybe you see her when you go to the same beauty parlor she does , huh ? That it ? " Mrs. Cormier stood up and said , " Boys , that 's enough . This is all settled . Daniel , Phil said he 's sorry , and we know the jacket is yours . So both of you run along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your teachers . " Daniel stood up . He stuck his chin out and said , " Fine with me . Because this boy just keeps telling lies and lies . Like how he knows my gramma . " " I do too know her ! " Phil almost shouted . " I 'm not a liar ! I see her all the time because ... because she 's my mom 's cleaning lady ! " The words seemed to echo off the walls . Daniel looked like he 'd been punched in the stomach . He backed toward the office door , his face working angrily . He yanked the jacket open , pulled himself free of it , and threw it on the floor at Phil 's feet . " There 's your jacket ! You take it and you tell yo ' momma that my gramma and me do n't need nobody being kind to us ! " And looking at Mrs. Cormier , he snarled , " Nobody ! "                 @ @ @ @
