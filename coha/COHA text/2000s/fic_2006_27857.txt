Chapter One All Heather wanted was a nice house . Well , a nice house and a nice lot . A few bushes out front would be nice too . And , of course , good schools . That was important . There were a few other things that were important as well . The house had to be new , of course . At least five thousand square feet . It had to have a great room . That went without saying . It had to have a two-car garage , minimum . Three would be nice , but she was n't greedy . And it really had to back up to some scenery , woods or something . Who wanted to pay more than half a million dollars for a house and have to look out at their neighbor 's swing set ? None of the other things on Heather 's checklist were absolute deal breakers . A basement gym ; a master bath with radiant heat , a Jacuzzi , and his-and-her toilets ; a marble powder room ; a kitchen shiny with stainless steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie-theater seats ; and a vaulted ceiling in the master bedroom-she wanted these things , sure . Actually , it was n't just a matter of wanting them . It was a matter of dollars and cents . Whatever house they bought , they would-eventually-have to sell . So if only for the sake of resale value , Heather needed these things . Well , most of them . She could make do without a media room if she absolutely had to . After all , thepioneers did n't have plasma TV , and they survived . And certainly growing up in that pathetic little Cape in Nutley , New Jersey , sharing an attic bedroom with her sister , Heather had managed without any of life 's luxuries . A radiator that produced more noise than heat , a bathroom that was n't even on the same floor as her bedroom . She 'd endured that . It had , as her mother was always saying , " built character . " And then there were all those years that she and Kevin had been squeezed into their two-bedroom condo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in from the Patels ' apartment across the hall and the pitter-patter of the not-so-little feet of all six Cosentini children thumping about upstairs . No , Heather could compromise a little on the new house . They could always add movie seats later . She and Kevin had fallen in love with this part of Burlington County , and they 'd been looking here every weekend for months . The area was perfect : country but not too country . Barns , horses , things like that-but there was also a new mall anchored by a Bloomingdale 's and a Saks , and its parking lot was filled with Jaguars and BMWs , so you could tell that successful people lived here . It was a great area , despite the little cracks her mother sometimes made about moving to the sticks . What did her mother know ? This was where Heather belonged and the kind of people she belonged with : men like Kevin who were doing quite well in the world , and women like herself with good-enough taste to spend that income . Most important , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a leg up in the world . That was the prize she had to keep her eye on : a successful future for their one and only son , who would be starting third grade in just a month . All she asked was a fair advantage . So far , though , she and Kevin had n't found exactly the right house . And Heather liked things exactly right . She prided herself on being an informed shopper , in checking out every possible choice . If you were n't careful , if you did n't do all the research , you could ( her stomach clenched at the very thought ) make a mistake . But it was August , and if they did n't move pronto , Connor would have to change schools partway through the year . And , well , Connor was n't exactly good with transitions . She had to think of Connor , did n't she ? That was the whole point . Today they were checking out Galapagos Estates . Maryanne , the sales manager , had told Heather there were a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a view of a pond-and they might snatch it up if they were quick . Well , Heather thought , who was quicker than she was ? So why was Kevin slowing down ? Their Land Rover stopped in a gravel lot in front of an old general store . It was a small plain white building with lots of signs . An old metal Coca-Cola sign that looked like it was from the 1940s , a big plastic sign for Vineland Farms ice cream , and smaller signs advertising sandwiches , beer and wine , coffee , copies ten cents . In front was a large ice chest and next to that a bench , which was occupied by a man in a feed cap who looked like he 'd just stepped down from a tractor . Fairly pathetic as a retail establishment , Heather thought , but not without a certain rustic charm . Maybe they had some apple butter , or jam , something else countryish she could bring back to Kevin 's parents , who were babysitting Connor . She prided herself on her thoughtfulness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I told you , it 's just down there . Maryanne gave me explicit directions . " He ignored her , grabbing the map off her lap . She sighed loudly . Just to let him know . Men . There was no use arguing . Heather pulled down the visor and puckered her lips , the way she always did when she looked in a mirror . She undid the elastic holding her hair , shook her head , and redid her ponytail . She looked exactly the same as she had before . She assessed herself critically , and-except for the fact that her nose formed a little red triangle , something that happened no matter how conscientious she was about sunscreen-she was not displeased . At almost thirty-five , Heather could , depending on the light , still pass for a high school cheerleader . A good hair colorist : that was her secret . And discipline . You could n't slack off . If you slacked off , you could gain weight . If you stopped wearing makeup , you 'd become plain . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the supermarket , in restroom lines at the movie theater . Powerless , pathetic women whose husbands left them . She checked the mirror often , but it was n't out of vanity . It was more like a breast self-exam . " I 'm going to get a Diet Coke , " she announced . The general store was a disappointment . No apple butter or jam , although there was Diet Coke . It was just a 7-Eleven with sawdust on the floor , Heather decided . On her way out , she glanced at the man sitting on the bench . He was wearing a feed cap and a plaid , short-sleeved shirt-probably synthetic-and he was chomping away on something that made his cheek bulge in a funny way . The man reminded her of a cow , sitting in a field chewing its cud . " Excuse me , " Heather said , with the perky voice she used whenever she needed faster service from store clerks and the people who checked your tickets at the airport . Like her mother said , you got more flies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was looking straight ahead , as motionless as a cigar-store Indian . " Excuse me , " Heather repeated . " My husband and I are looking for Galapagos Estates . I told him it was right down there , but he does n't believe me . " The man just continued to look straight ahead , chewing , as if Heather had n't just asked him a question . As if , she thought , she did n't even exist . Strange . Well , maybe he was deaf . She 'd had a bad bout of tinnitus back when she was in college , after going to a particularly loud Pearl Jam concert , and could n't hear anything but a hum in her ears for weeks afterward . She still had trouble hearing sometimes . Maybe this guy had that too . She would give him the benefit of the doubt . Heather was about to turn away when the man slowly leaned over and-still without looking at her-spat out a wad of chewing tobacco . It splashed onto the gravel , only a few inches from Heather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White . He had seen the little blonde get out of the big SUV and walk into the store . He had n't noticed her here before , but that did n't mean anything . Clearly , she was one of the new people . City slickers with their noses in the air . They liked the way the country looked , but God forbid they should smell manure . People like her were ruining everything with their great big ugly houses , and all those new strip malls with tanning salons and sushi places . The thought of eating raw fish made him want to puke . Harlan had been warming this bench for half a century . In the old days , there 'd been plenty like him , men who 'd grown up here , who 'd carved their initials into trees as boys , hunted deer , fished trout . Back then , men had time to sit and shoot the breeze . But most of the old farmers had died , and the rest had sold out . And the tradesmen-carpenters , plumbers , roofers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these days , they did n't have time to eat , let alone sit around . Harlan saw them scarfing down sandwiches in their vans , talking on their cell phones at the same time . Cell phones , Harlan thought with disgust . Plumbers going around like they were the president of the United States waiting on a call from Russia . That was the problem with people these days . They took themselves too goddamn serious . Harlan was one of the few men left in Hebron Township with property big enough to run a horse on . Not that he had a horse . He had hens . He was an egg man , just like his daddy had been . Only a couple of years ago , Harlan had gone organic . That 's what the people in the fancy houses wanted : " organic , " " natural , " " free-range . " Fine . It was like stealing . He could get $3.50 a dozen . He also hired out as a handyman , doing odd jobs for people in the big new houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hammer could make a fortune off those suckers . For all their fancy four-wheel-drives , not one of them could dig himself out of a little snowy driveway . They were as helpless as newborn kittens . Take the man over there in that SUV , the one the tarty little blonde had hopped out of . Handsome-enough fellow-looked a bit like a young JFK-and just as full of himself too , probably . By the looks of things , he could buy and sell Harlan ten times over . But when a flake of snow fell , this guy would be on the phone to someone like him , someone with a real truck and a snowplow . He would n't rake his own leaves either , or even blow them . He 'd have people for that too . People to clean his gutters , clean his pool , change his lightbulbs . Harlan sat on the bench by himself these days . He wished that one of the few old-timers left would come by and talk about where the fish were biting . He would n't even mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd gone to school with , coming in for Crisco . Any old face . Anybody who knew his name . But lately there 'd been nobody . In fact , the little blonde was the only person who 'd walked into the store in the past hour . He 'd heard her ask for directions , all right . But it was a free country , and he was free to ignore her if he pleased . He felt better after he 'd spit . He 'd aimed just right . He had n't hit her shoes , but he 'd gotten close enough to send her a little message . Welcome to Hebron Township . Now get out . A sliver of a smile broke across Harlan 's face , like a hairline fissure in a great outcropping of solid rock . " Did you see that ? " Heather said when she got back into the car . " See what ? " Kevin asked . " That man . I asked him for some simple directions , and he ... he ... " Heather started to sputter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That farmer , " she said , pointing at the bench . " Are you blind ? " She bent down and began to inspect her white Keds . " I think it was tobacco juice . Yuck . " " Does n't sound too friendly , " Kevin said . " You think ? " said Heather . " Good thing , like Maryanne says , most of the old-timers are leaving . " Kevin did n't say anything . He hated the way Heather quoted people like Maryanne . Maryanne this , Maryanne that . He 'd heard it all the way down . What did she think Maryanne was , a fucking oracle ? Heather stopped inspecting her sneakers . Apparently , they were n't stained . Thank God . They would n't have to sue the general store . " Maryanne says they all have gas fireplaces , " she said . " And guess what ? They come with a remote control . " " What comes with a remote control ? " asked Kevin . It was hard to keep up sometimes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fireplaces ! " " Oh . " " Come on , Kev . " Heather snapped her fingers . " Get with the program . " He sighed . He hated when she snapped . Some of the same things that had made Heather so attractive as a girlfriend-an undeniable vitality , an unexpectedly sharp tongue-were a lot harder to deal with in a wife . It had been one thing to chase after Heather when she was a cute little ponytailed coed at Rutgers . Quite another to spend his thirties always hustling to keep up . He slammed on the brakes . There was the sign : galapagos estates . It was made of logs and featured carvings of animals : a tortoise , a bird , a rabbit , deer . Two pine trees guarded the sign like wooden soldiers . Kevin steered the Land Rover down the curving drive , which was covered with a soft pine-needle carpet . It looked like the entrance to a state park , but for the fact that it ended , abruptly , in a small parking area filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales trailer . There was mud . There was always mud . It came with the territory , because of the bulldozers and the trucks . But Kevin frowned , knowing he 'd just have to pay fifteen bucks for another car wash . He was n't going to let mud cake up on the side of a fifty- thousand-dollar car . Heather rushed into the trailer , but Kevin stopped to survey the neighborhood . A black ribbon of road unfurled into the distance . The trees planted alongside it were tiny , but the houses were huge . Inside the trailer , which was air-conditioned to the point of refrigeration , was a rack of booklets printed on heavy , flecked , recycled stock . A large map dominated one wall , and a young Asian couple was inspecting it as if looking for hidden treasure . They were being assisted by a vivacious woman in her forties , who pointed to the map with a pencil . " Maryanne ! " Heather called . The saleswoman nodded politely to the couple and turned toward Heather . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Heather Peters . " " Just give me a moment , " Maryanne said , holding up a finger , " while I help the Lees . Why do n't you go check out the model house ? It 's right there . " Heather flashed a bright smile at Maryanne and took Kevin 's arm , walking him out toward the model . But once she got outside , her expression drooped . " Shit , " she said . " The Lees are probably getting the lot we wanted . " She was always so dramatic , his wife . " Look , Heather , " Kevin said . " I 'm sure there are- " " Were n't you listening ? I told you . Maryanne said there were only three houses left . " " Well , now there 'll be two , " Kevin said . " We only need one . " " If they get the one by the pond , I 'll just die . Damn , if we had n't stopped at that stupid general store , we might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fault . But it was a nice house . There was a home-entertainment center built right into the great room , and a nook in the bedroom for his treadmill . The mechanics were sound too . A brand-new , 95 percent efficiency gas-burning furnace presided over a basement clean enough to perform surgery in . No more dungeonlike cellars like his dad 's , with boxes everywhere , and crumbling asbestos , and generations ' worth of old tiles and linoleum and lawn furniture . It was fine . Great . Really , they all looked pretty much alike to him . The only thing Kevin did n't like was its name : the Walden . Each house in Galapagos Estates was named for a naturalist or conservationist or something about where they 'd lived . There was the Darwin , of course , the Cousteau , the Audubon , and the Walden , named for the pond where Henry David Thoreau had spent a year living simply . Was n't the house that Thoreau lived in basically a shack ? Maybe the name was supposed to suggest raw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the **29;729;TOOLONG asking price was a stretch-now he 'd have to make partner at the law firm-he did n't like the idea of living in the smallest , simplest anything . Heather grabbed his hand and walked up the stately circular staircase , which was topped by a rotunda . The floors still smelled of polyurethane . The smaller of the two walk-in closets in the master bedroom was bigger than the room he 'd slept in as a boy . Even the room Connor would get had its own walk-in closet and bathroom . " Well , what do you think ? " Heather asked . She had n't looked this excited since he 'd popped the question . " It 's okay . " He meant : owning a house like this would be a fair marker of his economic success , but he was n't going to start shrieking like somebody who 'd just won a refrigerator on a TV game show . " Just okay ? Come here . " Heather pushed Kevin into a walk-in closet . She closed the door and pressed him to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes me hot , " she said , her voice uncharacteristically breathy . " And wet .
