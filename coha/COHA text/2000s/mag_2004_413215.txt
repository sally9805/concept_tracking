Plagued by blackouts and seizures , this active , upbeat woman felt helpless as her illness got worse . Then she heard about a radical new treatment . // As Ellen Berty opened her eyes , she slowly became aware of her surroundings . It seemed that only a moment ago she had been driving her green convertible on the Beltway drive outside Washington , D.C. Now she was lying in the back of an ambulance . In an instant , Ellen knew what had happened : She 'd passed out behind the wheel again . ( Fortunately , the car had skidded to a stop in the breakdown lane and no one was hurt . ) Hearing " Ellen , Ellen , " she turned and saw paramedics beside her . " That 's when I realized things were getting really bad , " the 55-year-old retired teacher says . " The emergency crew knew me so well , we were on a first-name basis . " Ellen had been living with diabetes-and dealing with its symptoms-since she was a teenager . But lately her blood sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That day , as always , her cell phone and candy were within easy reach , but , she says , " My mind had shut down before I could use them . " That was frightening . " I 'd never let diabetes interfere ' with what I wanted to do , " Ellen says . " I could always take care of myself , but I was becoming a danger to other people . I thought , This has got to change . " There would , however , be several more blackouts , several more seizures , and several more visits from her neighborhood EMTs before things turned around-and , then , in a way she never would have predicted . WHEN ELLEN WAS IN EIGHTH GRADE , SHE WAS DIAGNOSED with type 1 diabetes , an incurable disease that occurs when the immune system attacks and kills the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas . People with type 2 diabetes-a more common form of the disease that often affects those who are overweight-can regulate their blood sugar levels through diet , exercise , and , sometimes , oral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must give themselves insulin injections . They walk a dangerous tightrope : If their blood sugar levels run too high ( hyperglycemia ) , there 's an increased risk of kidney failure , blindness , and nerve damage ; if ' their blood sugar falls too low ( hypoglycemia ) , they could pass out , fall into a coma , or even die . Despite her rigid regimen , Ellen managed to keep her diabetes a secret from most of her friends in her hometown of Rochester , New York . She carried her diabetic supplies in a spare eyeglass case , excusing herself to go to the bathroom when she needed to test her blood sugar or give herself an injection . " 1 just wanted to be like everybody else , " she admits now . Even her husband-to-be , Peter , was kept in the dark until the day after he proposed . " She said , Oh , by the way , there 's something I have to tell you , ' ' " recalls Peter . " I just did n't think it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like I could handle this on my own . " For a long time , she could . After marrying Peter in 1972 , Ellen landed a succession of teaching jobs , eventually working as an early-education diagnostician in Prince William County , Virginia . In 1981 the couple had a son , Ryan . Ellen would occasionally have a reaction from low blood sugar , but Peter-and even Ryan-came to recognize the signs . If Ellen seemed shaky or if little beads of perspiration appeared on her lip or brow , they would gently prod her to eat a couple of Life Savers , which they ' stored in coat pockets , desk drawers , glove compartments , and the nightstand next to the couple 's bed . Ellen 's first serious reaction occurred about 13 years ago . She was riding her bike down a hill when she suddenly passed out and crashed into a curb . She had no identification and no medical ID bracelet to signal paramedics that she was diabetic . ' Unconscious , Ellen was rushed to the hospital with a concussion , a broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she came to long enough to murmur her sister 's telephone number . When the hospital called , her sister Paula confirmed that the patient was Ellen , then added , " Do you know she 's diabetic ? " She heard the phone drop as they yelled down the hall : " Jane Doe is diabetic ! " " We had a serious talk after that , " says Peter . But despite taking diligent precautions , Ellen continued to have serious-and more frequent-episodes . " I would feel like I was on the crumbling edge of this hypoglycemia , and I would just fall off , " she says . " I 'd become unconscious , then wake up , ' and there would be the emergency people giving me a glucose IV . " One of the scariest incidents happened in 1996 . Ellen , fighting a bad cold , went to sleep in the guest room so she could use the humidifier . In the middle of the night , Peter heard a loud banging . he thought someone was at the door , but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he went upstairs and found Ellen-legs kicking , muscles twitching violently . Her blood sugar had fallen so low that she had gone into a grand mal seizure . Peter injected her with glucagon ( a hormone that elevates blood sugar ) and called 911 . Ellen had been trying to keep her blood sugar levels lower to prevent complications , but it was too risky a strategy . " That night , the doctor pretty much read us the riot act , " Peter recalls . " He said to her , I understand you 're trying to get better control to prevent long-term complications . But if you die in the meantime , it does n't matter . ' ' " Ellen loosened up her control , but still the reactions continued . At her job as an early-education diagnostician , colleagues would have to check on her throughout the day to make sure she had n't passed out at her desk . Nights were even worse . Peter learned to sleep lightly , ready to force-feed Ellen rolls of Life Savers-sometimes with the paper still on them-to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can just bite them off the roll and chew through the paper , " she says . " It 's not a pleasant experience , but 1 had to do it more than once . " The independence Ellen had fought so hard to maintain all her ' life was slipping away . Then she got a phone call one night from her father in Columbia , Maryland . He 'd just heard about an experimental treatment for diabetes on the news . Type 1 patients in the Edmonton Protocol , as it was called , had been injected with insulin-producing islet cells , extracted from the pancreas from a deceased donor . Researchers had tried this approach before with limited success , but now it seemed to be working . When Ellen heard that a clinical trial was going to start at the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) , just 20 minutes from her home , she looked into it . The procedure had some drawbacks . If she had the injection , she would have to take immunosuppressant drugs for the rest of her life to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could cause side effects like mouth sores , rashes , diarrhea , and fatigue . But if the procedure worked , she would no longer need insulin injections , and long-term complications could be better controlled . " It was n't that difficult of a decision , " says Peter . " We figured , how much worse could it get ? Life had become so stressful . Sure , she 'd have to take drugs , but we knew she might not survive much longer if she did n't do this . " After a battery of tests , Ellen was accepted into the program in February 2001 . The next step was to wait for a pancreas donor who matched her blood type . Ellen bought another cell phone , so she would be sure not to miss the call . She gave the number to three people : her husband , her son , and her contact at the NIH . Ellen was driving home from work one june afternoon , listening to the radio , when she heard a phone ringing . " I thought it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't they answer that ' phone ? " she recalls . " Then it hit me : Oh ! That 's my cell phone ! " Ellen frantically dug through her bag and answered the call just before the last ring . It was the NIH . " They said , " Ellen ? We have a match . ' ' " On the phone , Ellen remained calm , but when she hung up , she let out a huge yelp . " I thought , Oh , my God . This is it ! 1 may have a chance . " It takes six hours to extract , isolate , and test islet cells from a pancreas , so Ellen had time to go home and pack before heading to the hospital . For a life-transforming procedure , islet-cell transplantation seems remarkably simple . Doctors fill a syringe with a solution of islet cells and , using an X-ray machine as guide , insert the solution into the portal vein of the liver , which has turned out to be a receptive home to new islets . Ellen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturday afternoon she was sent home with a little bandage under her right breast , and by Monday she was back at work . Ellen continued to take lower doses of insulin for the next ten days until the cells adjusted , then she was told to stop completely . " I could n't believe it , " she says . " I checked my blood sugar a lot those first couple of days . I kept thinking , Is this really going to work ? But it did . " While Ellen has developed a few complications-mainly mouth sores-from the immunosuppressant drugs , she feels they 're a small price to pay for the freedom she has regained . Recently , Ellen and her husband went on a ski vacation . " It was so nice not to have to take my meter with me on the slopes , not to have to carry a ton of food to cover all my lows , not to have to check my blood sugar each time I went up on the lift , " she says . " It 's just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . As I skied down the slope , I felt so free . It 's like I 've been liberated . " Sidebar The experiment that 's working Since 2000 , approximately 260 diabetics have undergone the same pancreas-donor procedure-dubbed the Edmonton Protocol-as Ellen Berty did . Of that group , 85 percent did n't need insulin shots after one year , and 50 percent remained insulin free after three years . " But even the people who have to get some insulin shots are doing much better than before , " says Bob Goldstein , Ph.D. , M.D. , chief scientific officer of the juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation . " Now they 're finding it much easier to control their disease . " The National Institutes of Health is conducting a seven-year study to test the procedure , headed by James Shapiro , M.D , , of the University of Alberta in Edmonton . This treatment could help doctors develop better diabetes cures . To find out how to qualify for an Edmonton Protocol trial , go to www.clinicaltrials.gov and search for " diabetes , transplants .
