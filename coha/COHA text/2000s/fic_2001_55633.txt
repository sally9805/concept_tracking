They heard their mother yell their father 's name , and came from their beds barefoot and squinting . Jeff Driver was in the kitchen . He was crying , and he told them that the bridge on Cascom Mountain Road had washed out . He looked at Kate 's mother and said her name , " Carey . " Then he looked at Kate and David , and no one spoke . The floor was tracked with water and cold under Kate 's feet . The front door was open , and it was raining hard . <p> " Down to Lorde 's place , " Jeff said . " The truck just went over . Swept off . " <p> Their mother lifted her arms as if she did n't dare touch herself , or close up and only find emptiness . Her hair was dripping . <p> Kate pressed against David 's arm . Then David hit Jeff , swung out and punched him in the shoulder , and Jeff hung his head , and put his hand on the spot where David had struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the water drumming and pouring from the gutters , and suddenly it all went still , like that , and Kate heard the words as if they were said right next to her ear : " He 's dead . " <p> Before their mother yelled Lendel into the night , they 'd been in their rooms , and Kate had been asleep . Before that , she was awake . It was n't raining then . It was hot , sticky . She searched for the cool spots with her feet , and every now and then she snapped the top sheet up like a parachute and let it fall slowly and coolly back on her body . The crickets trilled in the field , and far down in the valley she heard the brook . The noise of the brook was constant , a muffled roar , a rushing sound , but louder than usual . It was overflowing , full of all the rain of the past few weeks . She and David had been down there . Fast water tore up the banks and dragged down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swirling pools , all that water in such a hurry . It was remarkable to think the rain had done this . The sound was so loud that you had to shout to be heard , so she and David had n't said much . They stood and watched , then ran along the bank upstream . There was a big rock they knew of that rose above a pool . It was a broad expanse of granite that stretched across the brook like the smooth back of a whale . You could fit your body into its potholes and worn spots . It felt soft , almost . Now the rock was completely underwater , and you would n't know it was there except for a dip in the surface where a rill folded backwards . And also how the water streaming over the top took the rock 's shape , only glassy and moving . The beaver lodge was gone , washed away . The beaver dam , too , completely knocked out , but there were still some of their felled trees caught up on the side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed she could forget it was the sound of the brook just as you forget the hum of a refrigerator until it clicks off . The grown-ups were on the front porch . There was her mother and father and Jeff Driver . They were drinking cool drinks ; she could hear ice cubes in the glasses . <p> Sometimes the grown-ups stayed out there a long time , and Kate would fall asleep hearing them , but not hearing the words , just the lull of their voices . There was her mother 's tone , like she was singing , though she was n't . It was her way of speaking with airy notes that seemed to hook one word to the next . Her voice moved over and around some of the men 's tones , or broke through , and the men would stop to listen . <p> Jeff Driver 's sound came in little bursts and stutters , and sometimes if there were more grown-ups , like the Lordes from down the road , if they were also there , Jeff 's sounds would be very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had a stopping sound he made , like he could n't get around a ball in his mouth . <p> Her father 's timbre was smoother , and she heard him less because he was a quiet man who took his time in saying things , and only said what was necessary . Though sometimes he could be very silly and make everyone laugh . It took you a little off-guard , and it gave you a happy feeling . <p> The grown-ups laughed , and chairs moved . The loose spring on the screen door jingled , and Kate listened , but the door did n't close all the way . The spring was broken . It would be Jeff Driver coming in . It would be him because if it were her mother or father they would pull the door to , and then there 'd be a clunk , but there was none this time . Jeff was inside using the bathroom , and her parents were quiet outside on the porch . This was before Jeff Driver and her father went down to Leah Flats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before they went to bed , she and David had joined the grown-ups on the porch . They 'd had cool drinks , too , lemonade . Moths fluttered against the outside lamp , and the air was thick , and they knew it would start raining again . More rain was coming , but it was nice to have this little break , and sit outside in the still air . There was no breeze at all . <p> Kate sat next to her father . He smelled of kerosene from washing his hands in it , trying to clean the stain off . Earlier in the day he 'd stained the table in the back room . It was a picnic table he 'd built with long benches attached . It looked funny in the back room , but soon it would be put outside in the yard . <p> He wore jeans with a hole in one knee , and Kate stuck her finger in the hole to tickle him . He let her do that for a while , pretending it did n't tickle , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a little , and she ran her fingernail lightly over the soft skin just below his kneecap , and then he grabbed her hand like it was a little mouse , or a spider , and brought it to his mouth like he was going to eat it . She shrieked and pulled her hand away , and there was some of his spit on her fingers because he 'd put them in his mouth . She wiped her hand on his leg and said , " Yuck . " <p> Jeff Driver laughed , guff guff , and Kate 's mother smiled , and they all sat back and listened to the sounds of the night and the thundering brook down in the valley . David sat in the rocker , and there was also that noise of the runners clacking on the wood floor and one of his heels scraping back and forth . David did n't laugh because he was always a little annoyed with Jeff for no reason  --  maybe this time because of Jeff 's laugh . David did n't laugh , but Kate could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be there . <p> It was just an evening on the porch . Soft light spread across the worn floorboards , dropped to the stone steps . The light waned on the walk , and surrendered to the blackness out there in the yard . But up on the porch they were in a cove of light . And the light draped over their arms and outstretched legs , and made elongated shadows that flowed from the bottoms of their chairs . Kate looked at the faces of her mother and father and brother and Jeff . There was an ease in her mother 's face , but also a weariness around her eyes . People always said she had her mother 's eyes . Kate gazed at her mother 's face , and it was as if she could see down through the years to when she 'd become a woman , a wife , a mother . There would always be pleasure in warm evenings on a porch , these quiet gatherings of people , family . And there would always be a sadness in it . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before they adjourned to the porch  --  Shall we adjourn to the porch ? her father said with a pretend haughtiness , as if he were addressing important people , royal people  --  before they went out to the porch , they 'd eaten supper . There was venison and macaroni , and the spirals of green fiddleheads that her mother had harvested from the woods . The smells of garlic and rosemary rose from the oven , and when they ate they tasted those things , too . <p> Before supper there had been the day . Kate and David watched the brook , and then they 'd crossed the field , and four deer grazed there . The deer caught their scent , jumped and fled , though one stopped at the edge of the woods and looked back with shining eyes . Then it leapt , and they watched its high white rump bob until it disappeared between the trees . <p> David said , " Remember that story Dad was telling us about the woman who was a deer ? " It was a bedtime story , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they read books now , but it was good to remember the story , and it made Kate want to follow the deer that had hesitated ; maybe it was asking them to follow . Kate was ten years old , but she still liked to believe in things . She liked to believe that animals could talk to you with their minds ; that beavers had elaborate mansions inside their stick huts ; that there were fairies living in the poplar trees . She knew that those things were n't real , yet there was something about being able to pretend , allowing herself to pretend , that felt like doors opening in her heart . Being ten was a very good age , she had decided . She was happy , and she wished that when she died she would be ten in heaven , no matter what else happened to her in her life , or how pleased she might be at other ages , she must remember that ten was the best , and that she should be ten in heaven , if there was such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the brook on the bridge the loggers had built , so it was stronger than most , and could hold huge trucks loaded with hardwoods . When they came up the hill to the cabin they saw their father hiking down . He was coming from his writing shack next to the cabin . He 'd built the shack so he could have quiet while he was writing , and he went there in the mornings and closed himself in . Sometimes Kate stood on tiptoe and peered through the tiny window . He sat in his chair and typed on the typewriter . Then he 'd lean back and smoke , and stare at the wall . There was a little sill where a two-by-four crossed , and on the sill he kept things : the skull of a raccoon he 'd found picked clean , a piece of black mica , a dried polypore as big as a dinner plate , a dog she had made out of clay , and an old silver belt buckle . Then he 'd turn back and type some more . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her for a few minutes , but only a few because he had to get back to work . <p> Now he was coming down the hill , and they ran to him . He had brown stain on his fingers . He said , " How 's the brook looking ? " And he wanted to go see it . It was exciting to go with their father , to show the brook to him as if they 'd discovered it . They told him they 'd seen four deer in the field , and he nodded , proud of them for knowing that seeing deer was a special thing . Kate knew the things he loved , and so she wanted to love those things , too . Like spotting deer , or the bear-claw marks on the apple tree , or moose track . Or the brook swelled and running out of control . A porcupine asleep and curled into the crotch of a tree like a huge bird 's nest . The rain sweeping down the mountain and across the valley in a sheet until it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods just before rain , and after rain . The sun when it sank behind Cascom Mountain , and mostly that moment when the last ray wavered and held at the ridge , then went down , like it had been swallowed . Fireflies blinking above the field like stars going on and off . <p> The three of them watched the brook , and they showed him how the big rock was completely submerged , and you 'd never know it was there except for that dip in the water just below it . He said , " We used to swim here , your mother and I , before you were born . " <p> The deer were gone , and no more came . <p> They went on up the logging road , away from the brook , and the sound of the water diminished . Their voices sounded brighter in the quiet woods . They went up the old road , past where any regular cars could travel , where it got steep and muddy and the grass grew like the hair on a Mohawk right down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a view and they could see the cabin below with its shed roof and windows like eyes . Kate thought about her mother inside and that she was making supper for them , and also for Jeff Driver , who would be coming from his job in the fire tower . Jeff usually came on Saturdays before he and her father went to Leah Flats to play poker with some other men . <p> In the clearing at the top of the ridge they stopped to look at the marker where they 'd buried their beagle a few years earlier . The beagle had been shot by someone , no one knew who , and it was sad to remember what a good dog he was , and also it was sad to remember that even in this sunny opening in the woods with the yellow grass , and mica glinting in the outcroppings of granite , there was someone out there who could shoot a dog . <p> They looked at the marker , then went on up the ridge to the old cellar hole where Zach Bean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the land was mostly fields and not so grown up with trees . Zach had sold these acres at eight dollars and thirty cents each , so now her father owned this land , and all the way across the field and over the brook and up the hill to the cabin . Bushes grew at the rim of the cellar hole next to lopsided stone steps that led up to nothing . Saplings had taken hold down inside the foundation and grown taller than the hole was deep . Branches reached above the crumbling walls , and some of the rocks had tumbled down into piles . It was from this place that her father and mother had hauled a long piece of cut granite for the mantel above the fireplace in their cabin . Her father had chiseled the words Len and Carey Built This House 1954 AD in the stone . <p> They sat and dangled their feet into the cellar hole . Kate was in the middle between her father and her brother . Her father sat close , and his legs went down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she felt small next to them . There was some dirt turned up in a pile and shovel markings down there where people had been looking for artifacts . <p> David had found some china fragments in the ground a few yards away , and one time he 'd been very lucky and discovered the silver belt buckle . But most of the cellar holes around the mountain had already been excavated by people who stayed at the lodge across the valley , and there was n't anything left to find . <p> Kate leaned forward . The base of the old chimney still stood , and orange daylilies grew in a tuft at its base . Once there was a kitchen and a stove , where Zach Bean 's great-grandmother set a kettle to boil . And there were rooms where children slept and whispered to each other , and then fell quiet , listening to the comfortable murmur of adult voices . A family had lived here and ate and slept , and much more than that . It was strange to sit here and imagine people walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced up and saw Kate and David and her father looking in ? <p> Kate leaned out . There was a rusty barrel down there for some reason . She stretched to see more , and then she was falling head-first into the hole . Someone clutched her shirt and yanked her back . Her collar came up tight on her neck , and it hurt , also it hurt where the hands grabbed her . David 's fingers dug into her arm . Her father 's hand went into her stomach . Her father gasped and said , " Oh , " in a way that sounded like he was falling himself , just catching himself from falling . It hurt how they seized her , and for a moment she felt angry . But her father had made the noise , and now she saw how she 'd scared him . She knew he would not want her to fall or be injured . He 'd made that noise , and she felt his arms around her , squeezing her , pulling her back onto the bristly grass away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Be careful , Katy , " David said , annoyed , and in a way that was nothing like the sound , the " oh , " her father had made , and how she 'd said that same word , oh , at the same time he had , as if they were one person falling when it had only been her . <p> Then her father said , " We should head back . " <p> Before this day there were many days , like the day Jeff Driver found the beagle lying dead on the trail , and how he wrapped the dog in a blue blanket , carried it to them like a baby . Or when Peter Lorde drove his big truck through the little poplar trees to make a road , and how they popped as they broke and flattened under the tires . Or when her mother and father held each other and circled the living room to the beat of a scratchy blues record , and how he lifted her and stood her on the table and held her hand so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to her . And those nights when headlights came down the road flashing through the trees . And a kiss on the forehead and the sweet dream of a deer that could turn into a woman . Of believing in whatever you chose . <p> Though there were some things you would never want to imagine . Things you did n't want to believe could happen . Things that made the world never the same again , changing the last moments of before and before and before because they were the last hours , the last minutes , the last sigh and breath . <p> <p> By Ann Joslin Williams <p>
