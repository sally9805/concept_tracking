// This spread , video stills of Roman Signer 's Kayak 2000 , in which the artist is towed along a country road in a kayak ; outside St. Gallen , Switzerland . All Signer works this article , unless otherwise noted , are actions documented on videotape by Aleksandra Signer. // Though little known in the US. , Swiss artist Roman Signer has been making his " temporary sculptures "  --  actions that he documents with film and video-since the 1970s . These events , which can involve anything from amplified snoring to small rockets , are usually short-lived , often funny and always cathartic . Outside St. Gallen , Switzerland , in the Rheintal district at the edge of the Alps , a dirt road runs alongside a small canal that leads through rolling pastures and herds of grazing cows . This bucolic locale is a prime site for Swiss artist Roman Signer , one of several in the area that he visits for what he likes to call his " experiments , " essentially actions that he considers to be temporary sculptures and which eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ films and photographs . Recently , Signer undertook a new experiment . It was a brief kayak trip , not in the canal , as you 'd expect , but directly on the road ( Kayak , 2000 ) . The kayak was attached to a small van via a towline . In the video , taken from the back of the van , you see Signer wearing a leather jacket and strapping on his motorcycle helmet . He climbs into the kayak , gives the thumbs-up signal , and takes off , to start careening down the road at about 20 miles per hour . The noise is frightful , and you think that the kayak is about to veer off into the trees , tumble headlong into the canal or break into smithereens . Hunched there , hurtling along , Signer reminds you of some lonely astronaut navigating an alien planet . At one point , Signer passes some wide-eyed cows which , inexplicably , do not scatter , but instead start frantically galloping beside him at the edge of the road , as if they ca n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Signer reaches his destination down the road ; he slows , then stops . In the kayak , he is up to his waist in gravel and dirt , for a gaping hole has been ripped in the bottom . He gets out , dusts himself off , turns the kayak over and inspects it ; it 's almost ruined , but not quite . After you stop laughing-and many of Signer 's works can be downright hilariousthe complex power of this piece begins to sink in , For one thing , Signer himself , kayak , curving towline , accidental cows , country lane and quiet Swiss countryside add up to a luscious ensemble that rivets your attention . In general , Signer 's idiosyncratic events-as-sculptures are strikingly , at times dazzlingly , visual . For another , there is the work 's poetic resonance , involving multiple associations and layers of meaning . It juxtaposes speed and stasis , exuberance and danger , accident and precision , and there is more than a hint of mortality in its imagery-someone rushing through a life as the body wears down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it radically ; a pleasant excursion on a sunny afternoon near the Alps was never quite like this . Moreover , for all this work 's verve , there is something unnervingly lonely about it , too : a single person making his eccentric way through a local environment that also serves as a stand-in for the COSMOS . If you wanted to make a list of major contemporary artists who , for whatever reason , are comparatively little known in the U.S. , Roman Signer should be right near the top . During the past few years there has been a surge of interest in his work in Europe , but he has exhibited rarely in the U.S. , and his work has been written about even less . This neglect is unfortunate , because since the early 1970s , Signer , now 62 years old , has been developing an extraordinary body of work , consisting of brief , transitory pieces and durable sculptures that are evidence of a process as well as an event , along with drawings and endless documentation . Many of his projects mix an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety ) with an impish , pranksterish humor . Sometimes this " research , " this desire to see what happens if a brief chain of events is set into motion , can be wildly funny , with slapstick mishaps , moments when things break down or veer off unexpectedly into mini-disasters . For Sink ( 1986 ) , a table , each of its legs in a metal pail , sailed forth on a precarious voyage into a river , only to tilt and sink two minutes later in a kind of tragicomic denouement-certainly among the most short-lived , fragile and awkward outdoor sculptures that you are ever likely to see . At other times , Signer 's events-as-sculptures yield images so beguiling that it 's easy to forget that they were more or less instantaneous and not painstakingly made over weeks or months . For Falling Barrel ( 1996 ) , a metal barrel filled with water was dropped from the ceiling to the floor . As the barrel plummeted , silvery water flew up in a ragged column , and at the point of impact more water jetted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including a rising and falling spray of droplets and the thudding impact that contorted the barrel , is heartbreakingly beautiful-and it also took about one second to execute , tops . That 's Signer at his best : a sculptor whose works embody pure transformation . Using a variety of means , he constantly seeks out the exact volatile moment when one body or form abruptly changes into another , in the process fusing creation and destruction . A number of historical sources feed Signer 's unorthodox art , including post-Minimalist austerity , Fluxus high jinks , various kinds of process or performance art and elements of land art . Signer first made his mark in the early to mid-1970s with outdoor sculptures such as spare geometric forms blasted into snow fields via explosives ; a gridlike structure of vessels that collected , and then spilled over with , rainwater ; or an explosion in a metal box in a forest sending smoke out of four openings to make a cross shape . Works such as these suggest that Signer is very much an heir to land artists like Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early Dennis Oppenheim . However , Signer rarely alters the landscape in any lasting sense and typically eschews anything monumental in favor of brief actions or events in dialogue with their surroundings , finally to disperse into the environment altogether , leaving only the scantiest of traces , or none at all .

Photo Marek Rogowiec. // No trace , that is , except for documentation in photographs , videos and films . Right from the beginning of his career , Signer has assiduously documented just about all of his actions in a before-during-and-after manner reminiscent of the laboratory . Photographic documentation , of course , was also important for the first generation of land artists , and was in fact the primary way that most viewers encountered their works . With Signer , however , documentation is central to his oeuvre . It reveals his processlittle cause-and-effect vignettes-and it also captures and preserves the startling beauty of his actions . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1994 his chief documenter , in videos , has been his Polish wife , Aleksandra Signer , herself a compelling artist whose medium is video . For all his eccentricities , Signer remains an image-maker par excellence , which his trove of documentation clearly reveals .

Photo Stefan Rohner. // One thing I noted in conversations with Signer , and in traveling with him to some of his favorite outdoor sites where he 's been working for years , is how deeply felt his engagement with nature really is . Working outdoors in the landscape has a particular importance for him . It 's where he feels most free as an artist , most concentrated and unencumbered , and it 's where , in his terms , " poetry " happens , albeit his kind of quirky poetry , which can involve surreptitiously flinging a bundled Christmas tree off a bridge like a spear into the void ( the tree spiraled to the ground far below with surprising elegance ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small rocket . Some of Signer 's actions occur in remote and dramatic locales-volcanoes or mountaintops , for example-but they can also involve things near at hand , like an electrical tower in a field on the outskirts of town . For High-Voltage Electrical Tower ( 1996 ) , Signer inflated a large red balloon with helium , then released it inside an electrical tower , where it rose to the top and stuck , as if in a cage . Suddenly this balloon , with delightful suggestions of children 's play or of raising a flag atop a ship 's mast , became a focal point in the landscape , an aerial burst of pure color . Occasionally during the 1970s , but increasingly during the 1980s and continuing to this day , Signer has appeared in his work , and when he does it 's as both instigator and subject . He 's like an inscrutable Everyman going about his odd business in lonely places , his slightly rumpled appearance , deadpan expression and deliberate motions all a signature part of his esthetic . In other respects , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a camera-shy recluse . Once , Signer went up to a remote part of Iceland , pitched his tent , set up powerful loudspeakers outside , hooked up a mike inside it , went to sleep and then snored into the bleak , yet haunting landscape , producing an earthshaking roar ( Snoring , Iceland , 1994 ) , all of which is recorded in a sustained , head-on video shot . Another time , in Poland , he made a vivid yet fleeting sculpture ( or , one could equally say , a painting ) by cross-country skiing across a field while flares fixed to his heels trailed pink smoke ; the wavering line they left in the air suggested exhaust from a rocket or an airplane ( Zakopane , 1994 ) . Both works temporarily mark Signer 's position in time and space . Implicit here is a personal dialogue with vastness-with huge empty landscapes , with the sky and geologic formations , ultimately with the universe itself . At the same time , there is also something clownish or foolish about these works , but then again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tinged with spiritual largeness or openness that seems more Eastern than Western , his St. Gallen kind of Zen . As much as Signer has been associated with temporary pieces like these in the landscape , he has also been identified with explosions , which frequently occur in his work , leading others to categorize him-somewhat erroneously-as " the explosion artist , " even though they 're just one part of his repertoire . He is one of the few people in St. Gallen , and probably the only artist , to have a license to keep explosives , which he has to itemize for local officials each year : how many blasting caps he has used , how much bomb fuse , how much dynamite . In order to make a series of self-portraits , Signer ( wearing his requisite protective gear ) once hunched over an exploding paint bomb in an oil drum ( Portrait Gallery , 1993 ) . The paint erupted , covered his face in a flash and turned him into a weird alien creature from another galaxy ; the documentary photographs were then hung as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1987 , stacks of paper are dispersed by explosives ; in Kassel , Germany . Photo courtesy Documenta Archives . // By contrast , Action with Fuse ( 1989 ) , another event with explosives , lasted a full 35 days . Alongside the train tracks from the Appenzell station to St. Gallen , a distance of approximately 12 1/2 miles , Signer laid out fuse in 328-foot segments . When ignited , the fuse burned for more than a month , all the while yielding intermittent flashes and mini-explosions as one segment lit the next : excitement in the hinterlands , a lonely festival in the middle of nowhere . This work , accomplished shortly after the death of Signer 's mother , had an intensely personal dimension . It connected Appenzell , where Signer grew up , with St. Gallen , where he lives now , in a memorial act linking himself and his mother , a kind of slowed-down , by turns wispy and fiery voyage parallel to the train tracks , along which he 's presumably traveled hundreds of times . This precisely calibrated venture , once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evoked the truly vast time that extends beyond one 's own brief life . To venture fully into Signer 's work is to encounter dozens , possibly hundreds , of explosions , which , over the years , have shattered tables , chairs and crates ; sunk kayaks ; toppled small towers ; reverberated through studios and galleries ; and sent various objects soaring into the sky . However , Signer is not enthralled with pyrotechnics for their own sake . Rather , working with explosives allows him to effect the kind of decisive transformation he favors . For Black Cloth ( 1994 ) , a piece of fabric was draped over a mysterious object . Fastened to the edges of the fabric were several tin cans and on the ground were four metal pails filled with water . You watch the video for a while , and nothing happens . Suddenly , everything erupts : the cloth flies upward with an aerial splendor like some dark spirit bird ascending , water flies from the pails , the cans fly off in different directions and the object is revealed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a helmet while calmly sitting in a chair . This is one of many instances when Signer 's experiments obliquely suggest enigmatic myths or ambiguous rituals-some spiritual birth or rebirth , perhaps a reference to folklore or a fairy tale , maybe a scrap of magic from preChristian rites which have long since vanished from memory . It 's also one of many instances , like Signer 's kayak trip on the road , when he put himself in what could have been a very dangerous situation . The possibility of bodily harm , however , is not something Signer seeks out , and his works have nothing to do with physical punishment or endurance . On the contrary , he does everything possible to shield himself from danger , and his work is devoid of bravado altogether . In fact , if it is possible to make discreet explosions , or cause humble moments of destruction , that 's precisely what Signer does . Still , danger is often a factor , and it 's an integral part of the whole way he conceives sculptures : not as things laboriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which contain his signature flash points of crisis , catharsis or both .

Photograph Panorama 2000 , 1999 , a loudspeaker housed in a red box broadcasts the voices of visitors in a nearby be ( fry ; in Utrecht , Netherlands . // Over the years , Signer has also developed a significant body of object-based works designed to be shown indoors , some of which , while hardly traditional , are more immediately recognizable as sculpture per se . But even with these works , which can be at once scruffy and elegant , you see how attuned Signer is to his process . A 1999 exhibition at Secession in Vienna featured a waist-high rectangular stack of two-by-fours on the floor bound by two bands , an upright bicycle on one side jutting into the stack and several boards protruding from the other side ( Bicycle and Wooden Boards , 1997-99 ) . From this sculptural evidence you could deduce that Signer rode a bike into the stack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite side , and then left everything just as it was . Many of Signer 's " instant " sculptures ( such as this one ) do actually require a great deal of planning , measuring and preparation . Photograph Left and inset , High-Voltage Electrical Tower , 1996 , a heliumfilled balloon is trapped inside a power-line tower ; outside St. Gallen . Photos H.J. Ruch. // Whether working indoors or outdoors , Signer has a personal lexicon of objects that he recycles into different works , including bicycles , buckets , metal barrels , ladders , balloons , toy helicopters , a three-wheeled truck and various types of secondhand furniture , among others . These common household objects can seem humble to the point of banality , but when subjected to the various pressures Signer has concocted for them , they take on a new kinetic life as intensely sculptural but also poetically vital forces and , indeed , as unpredictable forces of nature . Vivid images emerge from these objects , and you also ca n't help but note how an irrepressible humanity seems to course through them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shyness , keyed-up energy , agitation , grace . A flying bicycle , for instance , might suddenly burst into an empty room , trailing rolling smoke ( Bicycle , 1991 ) , or a chair might be catapulted out of an upstairs window in a hotel via a slingshotlike piece of taut rubber ( Action in Kurhaus Weissbad Al , 1992 ) . When you see a piece like the latter , you also realize how much Signer 's strangely elegant works constitute a brazen raid on the settled mores and routines of bourgeois society , Swiss in particular ( although he never makes a point of this ) . His sculptures misbehave , they defy convention , they turn utilitarian objects and practical actions into outlandish things involving wonder and humor . Signer , after all , is an artist who once put on his own hat via explosives ( Hat , 1997 ) . The hat was on the ground , on top of an explosive charge , and Signer was leaning out of an upstairs window . When the small bomb went off , the hat shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsuccessful-a bit too far to the right or the left . Finally , the hat 's trajectory was perfect . It was right there in the air before him . Signer clutched it with two hands , abruptly put it on his head and that was the end of the action . Delivered in Signer 's typically deadpan , expressionless way , this coolly ludicrous action ( captured on video ) , with its rhythms of longing , futility and-finally-success , winds up as something surprisingly touching . Signer is an artist 's artist par excellence , and he has long been a kind of cult figure . There have been many lean years , with relatively few chances to exhibit , little money and scant attention from the art-world establishment . Only since 1995 or so has Signer begun to be much more visible , thanks to major gallery representation through Hauser &; Wirth in Zurich and participation in important international exhibitions and museum shows .

Through analysis of student interview data , we find that such courses are an essential resource for students , in large part because the various benefits reinforce one another and magnify their influence . These benefits include learning about the college , classes , and study skills . In addition , students build important relationships with professors and peers . <p> Keywords : student services ; ; student orientation ; ; student retention ; ; student achievement ; ; student-faculty relationship <p> In keeping with their mission to help students from all backgrounds attain a college education , community colleges have implemented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the student success course ( also called college 101 , introduction to college , student orientation , or freshman experience ) , aims to help new college students learn about the institution and be successful there . The study described in this article used student interview data to examine these courses , finding that they helped students gain important knowledge and build critical relationships . <p> L : Background The mission of community colleges is to provide access to a postsecondary credential for students who may not otherwise be able to attend college . Because of their convenient location , open access , and low cost , community colleges tend to enroll students who are more academically , economically , and socially disadvantaged than do other postsecondary institutions . For example , nearly 30% of community college students are Black or Hispanic as compared to 20% of students enrolled in 4-year public and private postsecondary institutions ( Horn &; Nevill , 2006 ) . Approximately one fourth of community college students come from families earning 125% or less of the federal poverty level as compared to one fifth of 4-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Community college students face a variety of barriers to degree completion including the need to work , family obligations , and low levels of academic preparation . Entering freshman at community colleges are more likely to need at least one remedial course than are their peers at 4-year colleges , and they are more likely to need to spend a longer period of time taking such courses ( Wirt et al. , 2004 ) . <p> Student success at these institutions remains low . Six years after their initial enrollment in 1995-96 , 45% of first-time college students at community colleges had transferred to a 4-year institution or earned a certificate or degree ( Bailey , Jenkins , &; Leinbach , 2005 ) . Although 8% of students were still enrolled , 47% had left school without earning a credential . These statistics undoubtedly include some students who enter the community college with goals other than degree attainment or transfer , but it is nonetheless clear that many community college students do not persist toward an educational credential despite the institution 's best efforts . <p> To help students overcome barriers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implemented a variety of student support services . These services take many forms and address a variety of student needs . They may include , among other things , guidance and counseling focused on academics or careers , academic supports such as tutoring , or personal assistance such as child care ( Purnell &; Blank , 2004 ) . <p> Offering an array of services enables community colleges to meet the varied needs of their students . The prevailing philosophy is that such services can increase student success and persistence to a degree by providing them with additional resources and opportunities that help them become integrated into the college environment ( Bailey &; Alfonso , 2005 ) . In addition , providing student services can be seen as compensatory , helping disadvantaged students overcome their potential lack of information , cultural capital , or academic preparedness . <p> Despite recognized importance of support services for nontraditional students , researchers have pointed out that the efficacy of these services has not been demonstrated . Research on their effectiveness is sparse ( Bailey &; Alfonso , 2005 ; Grubb , 2001 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the literature on the effectiveness of student supports has focused on 4-year college populations whose needs differ from the needs of students enrolled in community colleges . They also noted that the data needed to rigorously evaluate program effectiveness are not widely available . <p> The student success course is one way in which a range of student support services can be delivered . This class , usually aimed at new students , provides participants with information about the college , help in academic and career planning , and techniques to improve study habits and other personal skills . The goal is to orient students to the various services offered at the college , help them acclimate to the college environment , and give them the tools they need to be successful in postsecondary education . <p> There is a body of literature that generally indicates an association between participation in these courses and a range of positive outcomes . For example , Schnell and Doetkott ( 2003 ) found significantly greater retention for students who enrolled in the freshman seminar at a public 4-year university . Similarly , Boudreau and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the course and retention and academic performance . These two studies used a matched comparison group design . Derby ( 2007 ) and Derby and Watson ( 2006 ) looked particularly at the course participation and retention of minority-group students . Their findings were more mixed than the results of the studies mentioned above ; in contrast to most other studies , the students in their sample were from a community college . <p> A recent , larger-scale study has been conducted by our colleagues at the Community College Research Center using data from all 28 Florida community colleges ( Zeidenberg , Jenkins , &; Calcagno , 2007 ) . This study tracked an entire cohort of students over 17 terms comparing those who enrolled in a student success course ( called a student life skills , or SLS , course in Florida ) with those who did not . Logistic regressions were used to control for student characteristics . The researchers found that students who enrolled in SLS courses were more likely than their peers to complete a credential over the study time period . Students taking the SLS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Florida state university system . <p> This base of quantitative work provides a promising picture of the influence these courses may have on student persistence and credential attainment . More quantitative work is necessary to establish a causal relationship between participation in student success courses and positive student outcomes . Yet what is lacking as well is a qualitative exploration of these courses as seen through the eyes of the students themselves . Such explorations can help us understand how the particular course content lends itself to student support . <p> The present study begins to build this qualitative body of knowledge . We sought to examine the institutional and personal factors that contribute to or hinder students ' persistence in the community college . The student success course was initially just one of many areas explored in student interviews ; however , it soon became apparent that the course was very important in influencing behaviors associated with persistence . Thus our findings on the student success course are emergent and inductive ; additional research is needed . <p> L : Method and Data We conducted a qualitative study of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , how institutional support services contribute to or hinder student progress toward a degree . We conducted interviews with community college students during their second semester of enrollment ( Spring 2006 ) , and reinterviewed the students 6 months later during the Fall 2006 semester , whether they remained enrolled or not . Because we were interested in the progress of degree-seeking students , including only students who had persisted to a second semester of enrollment was appropriate ; this excluded many students who might be considered experimenters or who otherwise might not have had degree completion goals . Participants were students in two urban community colleges in the northeast enrolling significant numbers of minority and economically disadvantaged students . We refer to these institutions by pseudonyms , Northern Community College and Eastern Community College . <p> Students were randomly selected from a list of all first-time enrollees in the fall of 2005 who persisted into the spring of 2006 . Nonmatriculating and continuing education students , as well as those who already had earned a postsecondary degree elsewhere , were excluded . Letters of invitation to participate in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also contacted by telephone at least three times at various times of the day to secure their participation in the study . Participants were offered a US$100 cash stipend ( US$50 per interview ) . Because of a low take-up rate , we supplemented the sample using a snowball technique for the recruitment of additional students . Forty-six students agreed to participate and were interviewed in the spring semester . Two students were later dropped from the sample because they did not meet the selection criteria ; thus our final sample included 44 students from the two colleges . The top row of Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics of the sample . <p> During the summer and fall , multiple efforts such as telephone calls , mailings , e-mails , and text messages were made to maintain contact with the participants and then schedule follow-up interviews . We were able to reinterview 36 of the 44 students in the original sample . Of these , 30 were still enrolled in college at the time of their second interview . The bottom three rows of Table 1 detail the demographic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fall of 2006 as well as the characteristics of students who were not reinterviewed . The study sample , like community college populations nationally , had more female students than male students and was quite ethnically diverse . <p> The difficulty we had recruiting and following up with students for the study , even with a cash stipend , was an indicator of the many demands and barriers faced by the students as they sought a postsecondary credential . Through phone conversations with students , we determined that the low take-up and follow-up rates were due primarily to the many demands on students ' time . Between school , work , and family responsibilities , even an hour-long interview was impossible to schedule for many students . In addition , a significant number of students or their families did not speak English and thus did not understand the nature of the research or were reluctant to participate in an interview . <p> During both waves of data collection , interviews lasted approximately 60 minutes and followed a semi structured interview protocol . They were recorded and transcribed for analysis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students ' initial experiences in college . We asked about their reasons for enrolling , their goals , their first- and second-semester courses , whether or not they were enrolled in the student success course and , if enrolled , what their experiences in the course were and what perceptions they had of the course . We also asked about their use and knowledge of student services such as counseling and tutoring centers . Finally , we asked about the challenges participants foresaw in completing their degrees ; where and from whom they sought and gained support and information about the college ; and what the college could do to make it easier for them to progress toward a degree . The interviews conducted in the fall of 2006 focused on students ' decisions to continue in college ( or not ) and on the challenges they faced in progressing toward their degree goals . We probed , in particular , for how their knowledge and use of available institutional services contributed to their progress toward a degree . <p> To gain a better understanding of the services offered at each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college staff members .

In total , we interviewed seven staff members at Eastern and six staff members at Northern . <p> The transcribed interviews were uploaded to NVivo , a software program for analyzing qualitative data . We created codes that addressed student knowledge and use of services . We also created codes that focused on the student success course , addressing whether or not students took the course , whether they found it to be helpful , and what types of information students received from the course . We also coded student attributes including race , socioeconomic status , and gender as well as student progress toward a degree . <p> Once the transcripts were coded , we read the interviews thematically , examining the ways that students discussed various aspects of their college environments . For example , we read all transcript segments related to student participation in a student success course , as well as all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerged from the data . <p> L : Description of the Student Success Course Both colleges in our sample offered a student success course , though the goals and focus of each varied slightly . At both institutions , students completed similar course assignments and activities . Among other things , these included traditional classroom exercises devoted to topics such as note taking and study skills , guided tours of the campus , presentations on learning styles , and group projects . <p> Northern Community College According to interviews with a college administrator , the goal of the college survival class at Northern Community College is to prepare students for success in an academic setting . To achieve this aim , the course teaches students about available college services , such as tutoring or the transfer center , and helps students learn about study techniques , time management skills , and how to develop a sense of community within college . The course also seeks to provide an environment in which students forge relationships with the course professor and develop a sense of community within the college . <p> The one-semester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculty members from the disciplines as well as college advisors teach the course . Course credit is transferable to other colleges , though whether it transfers as credit that can be applied to the degree depends on the receiving institution . <p> The course is intended to serve traditional college students  --  recent high school graduates who attend college on a full-time basis . Northern strongly encourages all first-semester , full-time students to take the course . Although it is not technically required , advisors automatically register students with this profile for the course ; of the students in our sample , all but one first-time , full-time student took the course . Thus it appears to be a de facto requirement for these students though it is not required for graduation . <p> Part-time students , however , are not automatically enrolled in the course and generally do not take the course . In part , this is due to the extra cost they would incur from taking an additional credit . ( The course does not impose an additional cost on full-time students because it is considered part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin their college careers as part-time students and later attend on a full-time basis , they are not required to take the class .

One Northern administrator explained , " If it 's a part-time student who did n't do as well as they should have , we 'll push their taking the course more aggressively . " <p> In our sample , 10 out of 19 Northern students were enrolled in the student success course ( see Table 2 ) . All were enrolled full time in their first semester of college . Of the remaining 9 students who did not take the student success course , 7 were enrolled part time in their first semester , 1 student was in a certificate program , who was in a certificate program and explained that explained that she was not required to take the course , and the other student was enrolled full time and was unaware that the course was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student success course at Eastern were similar to those at Northern .

Also similar to Northern , the course helps students prepare for careers by examining the culture of the workplace and the credentials necessary for particular occupations . <p> The student success course at Eastern meets once a week for 50 min . It is taught by seasoned faculty members and college advisors . Students earn one credit for the class , which is transferable to other colleges in the state , though the type of credit is again dependent on the receiving institution . <p> Unlike the course at Northern , the student success course at Eastern is directed toward all students entering the college whether or not they are enrolled on a full- or part-time basis .

Comparatively , 4 Eastern students did not take the student success course ; 3 were full-time students and 1 was a part-time student . <p> L : Findings As we analyzed the data , it became clear that the students generally found the course to be beneficial in a variety of ways : They gained information about the college , developed skills and techniques that could help them in their academic endeavors , and created important relationships . In addition , these benefits reinforced one another to bring about behaviors that supported persistence . <p> Reported Benefits of Participation Information Students reported that the student success course was a convenient , one-stop location for receiving a variety of necessary information in a coherent way ; this was in contrast to how they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wealth of information to students on wide-ranging topics including graduation requirements , course schedules , available support services , and student events and clubs . This information is made available through a variety of sources including advisors , professors , and printed materials such as fliers and course catalogs . Students reported , however , that many of these information sources were not well coordinated and were often difficult to access . This finding is exemplified through a response one Eastern student had to the question , " What is the worst thing about your school ? " The student explained , <p> pre-formatted table Students who did find useful information described how they would encounter these information sources randomly , for example , from a flyer posted on a bulletin board or through an impromptu run-in with a professor or peer . This meant that they often did not get the information they needed in ways that were useful to them or at appropriate times in their educational trajectories . They did not appear to have a consistent and reliable source of information . <p> In contrast , students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious location for receiving this type of information . As a result , they found that they were able to make use of the information gained through the course more effectively than the information gained through other sources . They reported that the course helped alleviate much of the confusion they felt when using other information sources and that they were able to trust the information received through the course more completely than the information received elsewhere . This was particularly true for information in two areas : college resources and course selection . <p> College-related information and resources . As noted above , students in our sample reported that the student success course provided them with information about the services available at the college such as personal counseling , college advising , tutoring , transfer advising , and student activities . This course was an important avenue through which students became knowledgeable the resources available at the college . Students who did not take the college success course reported receiving information about college services through random interactions with professors , peers , and general college advisors . These interactions gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet students did not receive a full picture of the services available . In addition , not all students experienced these interactions and were thus left without an understanding of the resources offered at the college . <p> Why was the student success course more effective in presenting this type of information than other sources ? First , the course enabled students to engage in small and large group discussions and complete assignments that focused on institutional services . For example , students were often required to read their student handbook to familiarize themselves with the services offered at the college . Students found this exercise helpful ; as one student said , " I got to know more of the things that are available in college . I never knew about the tutoring until I really got to read the student handbook . " Second , class visits from various college representatives provided information to students . For example , one student reported that she learned about a specialized support program for which she was eligible through a speaker who came to her student success course . Finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support services offices on campus . Students said that these tours helped them identify the locations of important offices on campus and connected them directly to the staff members in those offices . As a result of these activities , our analysis indicated that students who participated in the student success course generally knew more about available services and had more accurate information about these services than did the students who had not enrolled in the class . <p> Information on courses and course selection . Students also found that the information about course selection and graduation requirements gained through the student success course was more useful than the information gained through other avenues such as college advisors . Course advising for first-year students at the two colleges in our sample usually consisted of a short meeting with a college advisor prior to course registration . Students met with whichever counselor was available , and if they had follow-up questions , they usually met with a different counselor . Students often reported feeling rushed during these meetings and said that the meetings rarely focused on long-term goals or planning . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during this process . <p> The student success course appears to remedy some of the confusion students felt when using the general college advisors . Students in our sample reported receiving information and guidance regarding program planning and course selection in their student success course . This occurred through individual meetings with their college success professors , class presentations from general college advisors , and projects . For example , during a classroom observation at Eastern , we observed the professor inviting the students to meet with her after class to register for classes if they had n't already done so . ( At both colleges , student success professors were permitted to register students in lieu of college advisors . ) When the class ended , there was a long line of students waiting to meet with the professor . <p> A study by the Community College Survey of Student Engagement ( 2007 ) found that students perceived faculty members to be their best source for academic advising . Our research indicated similar findings . Many students in our sample felt that they received good advising from their student success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose a major , select courses , and get advice about what professors they should take classes from . Unlike the general college advisors , their student success professors knew them on a personal level and could suggest courses that fit into their academic and career plans . These professors became important tools students used to gain valuable information from . One student explained , <p> pre-formatted table Students who took the student success course also received information on course selection and program planning in other ways . For example , a student described how a general college advisor came in to speak to the class and went over the programs and degrees available at the college . The advisor also handed out program-specific sheets that enabled students to keep track of what courses they had taken toward their major and what additional courses were necessary to complete their major requirements . Students also completed a project on their major . They focused on the career options that were available through their majors , including how much money they could make and what steps were necessary to achieve their career aspirations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing projects like the one described above was useful in pursuing their academic and career goals . <p> Research shows that there is a relationship between poor academic advising and attrition . One study found that students who reported having high quality advising dropped out at a rate that was 25% lower than students who reported receiving poor advising and 40% lower than students who said they received no advisement ( Mezner , 1989 ) . Students reported that they gained important course advising and information through the student success course , particularly in comparison to the information gained from other sources . Presumably , the quality of information received through the course will help them persist in college . <p> Skills That Support Academic Success Students in our sample also reported that the college success course helped them develop time management and study skills they needed to be successful . This is critical in light of the fact that community college students often have many other commitments besides their studies such as taking care of family members or working full time . A recent national study on community college students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 hr per week and 34% spend 11 or more hours per week caring for dependents ( Community College Survey of Student Engagement , 2007 ) . Given these challenges , personal skills such as time management and effective studying may be crucial to student success . Numerous administrators and practitioners believe that focusing on personal habits and skills may be just as important as emphasizing basic reading and mathematics skills ( Boylan , 2002 ; Pascarella &; Terenzini , 2005 ) . <p> How did the student success course encourage the development of these skills ? First , the class curriculum included lectures on strategies for managing time . One student explained , <p> pre-formatted table Second , course activities helped students learn about and practice effective academic habits . During one course observation , for example , students were completing presentations on note-taking techniques . This helped the student presenters practice such techniques while teaching their peers about this useful skill . In another student presentation , students discussed good study habits , highlighting examples of how to study effectively , such as by forming study groups . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the student success course : <p> pre-formatted table Relationships Several students described how the student success course helped them forge relationships with their peers and professors . These relationships are hypothesized to be particularly important , because they can help students integrate into the social and academic fabric of the school , thereby encouraging them to persist to a degree ( Tinto , 1993 ) . It is often difficult for community college students to forge such relationships because of the myriad demands on their time . Students reported that the student success course helped them form relationships with professors and peers that they would not otherwise have created , thereby increasing their integration into the college . <p> The course encouraged these relationships in a number of ways . Of primary importance was the class 's emphasis on participation . Students were often required to participate in class discussions and activities , which helped them develop a level of comfort in the college and gain the confidence necessary to create relationships with peers and professors . The emphasis on communication created a community within the student success classroom , encouraging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained , <p> pre-formatted table In addition the emphasis on participation and group activities allowed students to get to know one another and meet peers with whom they could find things in common . One Northern student described how she met a close friend through her college survival class . The two were paired for a group discussion and realized they were from the same city in Germany . She explained how they " instantly connected . " Another student said that the most important aspect of the class was that it helped him to make friends . <p> These relationships transcended the college success course and , as predicted by Tinto ( 1997 ) , created a broader sense of integration into the college for students . For many students in our sample , the college success course served as a gateway to integration into college life . For example , one student explained that the college survival class helped her become more comfortable participating in other courses as well . She explained that because participation was a focal point in the college success course , she became accustomed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt unsure or confused , and talking with her peers . This comfort allowed her to feel confident participating in discussions and asking questions in her other classes . Likewise , students said that just knowing where the services were on campus and who to talk to about particular issues that arose increased their level of comfort on campus . One Northern student explained this phenomenon , <p> pre-formatted table Overall , the course helped students become familiar with campus life including the professors , students , and support services . This led to a feeling of comfort and integration on campus . <p> Magnification of Individual Benefits The reported benefits described above are no doubt important , but they can be gained through avenues other than the student success course . It is fair to ask then why spend student and institutional resources on a course ? It is likely that there are less expensive ways to give students important information . Analysis of the interviews revealed that the course itself is important because the benefits extend beyond the information students receive . The components of the student success course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accrue to students through other venues . In other words , within the context of the student success class , the individual benefits reinforce one another to create even greater outcomes and have a long-lasting impact . <p> Information Plus Comfort Lead to Use of Services In order to benefit from support services , students need to actually use them , not just know about them . This means that students need to know how to access a service and feel comfortable doing so . The student success course encourages both of these things , thereby helping students take advantage of services in a way that just learning about them , or just feeling comfortable on campus , would not . <p> Tutoring is a prime example of this . At both colleges , it was a widely publicized support service , and most students learned about it from a variety of sources . However , students in our sample who took the student success course were much more likely to actually attend tutoring sessions than students who did not . Fifty-eight percent of students in our sample who took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of students who did not take the course did so . Given the small size of our sample and the exploratory nature of the study , we can not assume there is a causal relationship . But it is important to remember that students usually enrolled in student success courses because they were required to do so , not because they were more motivated or more conscientious than students who did not enroll . Thus the correlation may indicate that the course encourages use of tutoring services . <p> One could argue that this finding emerged because one of the colleges in our sample required the student success course for full-time students only . Thus students who did n't take the course were more likely to be enrolled on a part-time basis and have less time to access campus resources . However , when we analyzed the interview data , a strong theme emerged in the fact that many students who took the college success course described how comfortable they felt accessing campus resources and indicated that activities in the student success course encouraged that comfort . It appears that an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students ' use of support services ; we believe this would be apparent whether or not students were enrolled on a full-or part-time basis . <p> Students reported that the structure of the student success course had a lot to do with their use of the tutoring centers . As we have noted , they learned about this service through their course . This basic information was the first step in making use of the service . However , the personal relationships fostered by the course created additional encouragement to take advantage of the tutoring services . The personal contact that came from the visits of the tutoring center 's personnel to the student success course made students feel comfortable visiting the tutoring center later on . As one student explained , " She the college success professor brought counselors and advisors to the classroom to speak with us on college , majors , tutoring , a lot of things to encourage us to continue to come . ' Do n't be afraid to use them , use their assistance . ' " These visits were more inviting than other information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would actually make use of tutoring . <p> The campus tours offered through the student success course served a similar purpose by informing students while simultaneously raising their comfort level . Because students were actually able to visit those offices and talk to people , they were less intimidated when it came time to access them . <p> Relationships Plus Course Advising Lead to Good Advising As we have noted , many students felt that general course advising was poor but that they received good course information in their student success courses . In addition , students created relationships with the professors of their student success courses . For many students , this relationship extended beyond their time in the student success course , turning into a long-term source of quality course advising . <p> The structure of the student success course encouraged interactions between students and professors , thus students felt that their student success professors knew them and their goals well . This enabled the student success professors to give students individualized advice on courses , which was greatly appreciated . Because students had a relationship with and trusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class ended , opting to meet with the student success professor rather than a college advisor when selecting courses for future semesters . One student , whom we quoted earlier as saying that she received information about courses and professors from her student success instructor , epitomized this process . In her second interview , a full year after she took the student success course , she was still meeting with her student success professor , saying , " She 's sort of like my go-to person now . " Because students felt comfortable in the student success course , they returned to their professors for advice even after the class ended , thereby enabling the influence of the course to extend well beyond the confines of the curriculum . Such a long-term relationship and in-depth information source was harder to come by for students who did not take the student success course . <p> Relationships Plus Integration Lead to Information As previously discussed , it appears that the student success course facilitated students ' relationships with their peers and professors . That seems to have contributed to students ' overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the college . These two benefits reinforced each other and enabled students to access important information networks in the college . Through their feeling of assimilation , students felt comfortable making contact with even more people such as classmates , staff members , and faculty members , which increased the amount of information they were able to access . <p> Social theorists have suggested that social relationships create a network whereby information can be acquired ( Coleman , 1988 ) . For example , students who form social relationships with peers benefit because those relationships grant access to information . Through their relationships with classmates , the students have access to information that can help them in college , including information on what professors they should take classes from , what classes are required for their major , or what offices to visit for resources they need . Students in our sample often referenced their peers as a valuable source of information . One student explained how she chose a course based on a conversation with a friend in class . She felt that her friend 's suggestion helped her choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our sample also mentioned nonacademic information that they received from their peers . For example , one Eastern student described how a friend from a psychology class who worked at the college 's career office connected her to a staff member at that office who subsequently helped her find an on-campus job . As with the course advising discussed above , these benefits lasted beyond the scope of the course and influenced students throughout their time in college . Such long-term benefits are unlikely to accrue from services that are not presented in the form of a long-term course that encourages the development of relationships over time . <p> Areas Needing Improvement As we have shown , the student success course appears to have many benefits for students and students feel quite positively about their experiences in the class . There are , however , some drawbacks and areas that need improvement . <p> First , although the student success course was a key source of information for students , the timing and structure of the course influenced the usefulness of this information . Almost every student in our sample @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those few students who found the course unhelpful took the course during their second semester rather than during their first . This is not surprising . The course was designed to acquaint students with the college , and students therefore felt that it was counterproductive to take the course after they had been enrolled for some time . As one student explained , <p> pre-formatted table Because campus policies occasionally permitted students to enroll after their first semester , this is an important finding that has implications for policy and practice . <p> Similarly , students sometimes reported that the structure of the course was unhelpful . In particular , the organization of the curriculum meant that information was given in a less-than-timely manner . For example , a few students were frustrated because the campus tours occurred too late in the semester . One Northern student emphasized this by saying , <p> pre-formatted table Finally , the analysis of the interviews showed that although students generally learned about the resources available at the college this did not always ensure that they actually made use of them . We found this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transfer center . The transfer center was an institutional service that was discussed in the student success course . Though students invariably mentioned that they learned about this service through the college success course , few ever visited the center . <p> Prior research ( Grubb , 2001 ) has shown that it is important for students to begin planning their career and educational trajectories , including transfer plans , early in their community college careers , and many students in our sample acknowledged that it was important to use the transfer resource center when planning transfer to a 4-year institution . Yet even in their third semester at the college , when many students were close to graduating , few visited the transfer resource center or had started to solidify their plans to transfer . For example , one student , who was in his third semester at the community college and who planned to transfer to a 4-year institution in the following semester , still did not feel it was necessary to visit the transfer center . " No , I 'm not transferring yet so I have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students who are transferring out . " <p> It is unclear why students did not make use of the transfer center , despite its discussion in the student success course and the course 's ability to encourage use of other support services . One possibility is that students did not feel a sense of urgency about transfer ; although low grades motivated them to use other support services , transfer may have felt too far in the future for them to act on it . Whatever the reason , it is important to recognize that , as powerful as it is , the student success course does not encourage use of services equally . Future research should seek to determine why this is the case . <p> L : Conclusions and Implications This article examined student success courses at two community colleges . We used in-depth interview data from students enrolled in the courses , as well as from their peers who did not take the courses , to examine students ' experiences and student learning . Though the findings are tentative , they support other research on the effectiveness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide an emergent theory of how the courses do this . <p> Interviewees who took a student success course were generally positive about their experiences and reported learning a variety of important skills and college-related information . Although their peers who did not take the course often received similar information elsewhere , they had more difficulty doing so . The interview data indicate that student success courses may be an efficient and effective way of providing such information to students . <p> Students reported that these courses were key in helping them obtain information about the college and courses , develop stronger study skills , and develop meaningful relationships . The courses had unintended benefits as well , in that the sum of the components of the course led to outcomes that individual components could not have created on their own . With some exceptions ( discussed above ) , students reported not only knowing about , but actually using college services as a result of the college success course . They attributed their willingness to access services such as tutoring to the increased comfort they felt on the college campus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationships developed through the student success courses lead to long-term information sources and quality course advising . <p> Because the importance of participation in student success courses was an emergent finding in our study , we were unable to conduct in-depth analyses disaggregating the relative importance of various course benefits . We were unable to determine , for example , if students benefited most from the academic advising included in these courses or from other course activities . In addition , because most of the students in our sample who took the course were enrolled on a full-time basis , we could not compare them to part-time students who took the course , and we therefore could not identify possible differences in their use of services . Finally , because the majority of our sample participated in the course , and because the sample for this exploratory study was small , we were unable to analyze whether course participation positively influenced student progress toward a degree . Future research , including random assignment studies , should investigate this and the other examples discussed above . <p> However , our findings provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students adjust to the community college . The positive ways in which they discussed this class , and the frequency with which it was identified as a location for learning about and adjusting to the college  --  often without probing from the researchers  --  underscores the primary role the student success course plays in encouraging positive student outcomes . Although future research is necessary to more clearly link course participation to student outcomes , the findings support the contention that these classes can help students meet their academic goals . <p> There are a few caveats to these positive findings , however . The first is that the timing of the course appears to be an important component in increasing its effectiveness . Not surprisingly , students who take student success courses later in their college careers feel less positively about , and appear to gain less from , the class . Similarly , the course should be structured to provide information to students at the time that they need it . <p> We also recommend that colleges consider making student success courses a requirement for all degree-seeking students . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly those who do not have other sources of information about college or who are peripherally connected to life on the college campus . And yet these students often do not take the course . At one of our colleges , the student success course was only required of first-time , full-time students . Part-time students , who have fewer opportunities to make social connections and access support services through other avenues , are the very students who could most benefit from the course , but they are not required to take it . <p> Finally , given the frequency with which student success instructors become informal advisors to students , and given the quality of advising that this seems to provide , we suggest formalizing this relationship . Student success instructors should be named official advisors for their students . This would give students a clear source of advising after completion of the student success course , access to an advisor who knows them and their goals , and an advising relationship that is comfortable and familiar . We would expect students to make use of advising and receive higher-quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . <p> Student success courses have the potential to help students meet their educational goals . Students participating in this study reported learning valuable information through the class and making connections that help them progress toward their degrees . As community colleges seek ways to improve rates of degree attainment , these courses can offer an important strategy for achieving this goal . <p> Authors ' Note : This work originally appeared as a working paper on the Web site of the Community College Research Center , Teacher 's College , Columbia University . <p> L : Table 1 First-Round Participants and Second-Round Participants , by School and by Gender and Ethnicity pre-formatted table L : Table 2 Participation in the Student Success Course , by College and Enrollment Status pre-formatted table L : References  --  Bailey , T. , &; Alfonso , M.
