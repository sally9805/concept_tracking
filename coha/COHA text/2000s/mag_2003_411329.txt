They 're much smarter than the average deer hunter . At some point early in their lives , something clicks in their cervid brains and they learn how to become invisible . People get glimpses of them now and then  --  huge racks , just barely seen ; heavy bodies , vanishing like smoke ; monster hoofprints , days old . For all but very skilled hunters and very lucky hunters , taking one of these near legendary bucks remains a dream . But they are there nonetheless , and every year people do connect . And not only are there areas where you stand a chance of collecting the buck of a lifetime , but there are plenty of them , all around the country , open to anyone for the price of a license .

Because the terrain is so vast , rugged , and remote , though , it harbors bucks that grow to tremendous sizes by eluding hunters every season . " Statewide , 20 percent of the antlered-buck harvest is 4 1/2 years or older , " says state wildlife biologist Gerald Lavigne , " but the central counties are among the best . " Gerald Murray took the third-largest typical ever in the state  --  a net 186 2/8 Boone and Crockett buck that would have been Maine 's No. 1 typical were it not for an extra tine  --  by hunting a cranberry bog 18 miles from the nearest paved road and another mile hike in from that . Although Murray got that deer nearly two decades ago , massive bucks continue to come from this remote region every year .

Much of the vast forest preserve called Adirondack Park is wilderness , and the majority of it is open for public hunting . It is the best bet in the Empire State for a trophy , according to Big Game Unit biologist Kelly Stang , because large portions of it are isolated , allowing bucks to reach older age classes . Both the high elevations and the surrounding foothills , with their abandoned farms and brushy areas , are good . B &C; bucks are n't common but occasionally one is taken , such as the state 's No. 2 nontypical , a 225 2/8 from St. Lawrence County .

" Age-structure data indicates that the number of antlered deer 2 1/2 years or older in this region 's population varies between 37 and 47 percent , " says state deer biologist Doug Hotton . One of the reasons it 's so high is that hunters in this coastal-plain area are willing to shoot does , taking pressure off the bucks . Over half the harvest consists of antlerless deer , and the buck-to-doe ratio is an incredible 1 to 2 . Other reasons for the large-racked bucks : rich soils ; large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mild winters ; and abundant woodlots for cover . Locations that offer good public hunting include Earlville Wildlife Management Area and C &D; Canal Lands in Cecil County , Millington WMA and Sassafras River Natural Resources Management Area in Kent County , and Wye Island NRMA in Queen Annes . A 130-to 140-class buck is a real possibility here . Some locals hold out for a 150-class deer or higher . B &C; bucks are taken every season , such as William Shields ' 199 3/8 nontypical , killed in 2001 in Talbot County . Last season a pending state-record typical was shot in Kent County that netted a whopping 194 , and Steve Pesterman took a 190-gross-score 14-point nontypical Pope and Young buck in Talbot County .

That has allowed even more bucks to reach old age . Nontypicals scoring 211 and 249 3/8 were taken from Rockingham County in the Shenandoah Valley . The current state No. 1 typical , a massive 188 6/8 net 10-pointer , was shot by Gene Wilson in Shenandoah County in 1985 . A buck that claimed the spot as the No. 1 nontypical in the world for blackpowder was shot by James Smith in 1992 on the eastern slope of the Blue Ridge  --  one of the two mountain chains that form the Shenandoah Valley . With a 30-inch spread and 30 points , it scored a whopping 257 4/8 . Lots of deer in this region feed in the valley on crops , then head up to the cover and inaccessibility of the forest during the day . Setting up a stand along these travel routes from the low farmland to the mountain ridges is a great way to intercept a buck .

" Counties in District 4 ( southeast Ohio ) have the highest deer densities ( 20 to 30 per square mile ) and the highest deer harvests , " says wildlife research biologist Mike Reynolds . " The region also has a higher percentage of mature bucks in the harvest . Counties with the most entries in the Buckeye Big Bucks Club include Muskingum , Licking , Hocking , Athens , and Coshocton . " With a limit of just one buck per season , hunters take numerous does , keeping the buck-to-doe ratio low . That , along with rich soils , steep hills , and mixed farm and hardwood habitat , makes this region a strong producer of bucks in the 130 to 150 class . Reynolds says more hunters are passing up young bucks , too . " Last year less than 60 percent of the buck harvest was yearlings , down from 70 percent in years past .

Yet that is just one of 20-plus B &C; bucks being tagged annually here . And just this past year , Benjamin Brogle of Lancaster took the biggest nontypical ever in the state  --  a 260 1/8 giant ( see " Biggest Buck of the Year " on page 65 )  --  and the biggest buck known by B &C; officials to have been taken last season . Count the state 's one-buck limit as one reason . Another is a growing herd that has not overpopulated its habitat . A record-book trophy could be taken anywhere in the state . " Over 60 counties have produced B &C; bucks , " says state biologist John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the best chance at a trophy , head east .

The first countywide QDM regulation ever to be enforced was in Dooly County , where a minimum 15-inch spread is required for bucks to be legal . Now six counties in the state follow QDM rules . Food plots are also used extensively ; one helped to nurture a 214 nontypical that was killed last year near Pine Mountain . Although many areas produce trophies , the Upper Coastal Plain  --  a diagonal band stretching across the south-central part of the state below Macon  --  is the most consistent region for older bucks .

" Combine good nutrition with low deer densities ( 20 to 35 per square mile ) , large land holdings , and low hunter pressure and you have the ingredients for growing big deer .

NONRESIDENT LICENSE : $177 770-414-3333 ; www.dnr.state.ga.us 8 ALABAMA ( Black Belt ) Alabama Hunters used to pride themselves on the number of bucks they bagged , sometimes taking full advantage of the " buck a day " limit to kill 10 or more in a season . That attitude has changed , particularly in the Black Belt region south and west of Montgomery , including Sumter , Pickens , Greene , Marengo , Hale , Dallas , Wilcox , Perry , Lowndes , Montgomery , Bullock , Macon , Barbour , and Russell Counties .

" Bucks harvested on these properties tend to be 3-plus years of age . " Most are solid bucks in the 125 to 140 class , but once in a while a brute comes along , like Jon Moss ' 259 7/8 state-record nontypical , taken in Perry County in 1989 . Getting in on a lease is the best bet for hunting this area on a regular basis , but lots of outfitted hunts are available . " Several things contribute to the Black Belt 's ability to produce big bucks , " says Cook . " The primary reason is the region 's soils . They are some of the most fertile found anywhere in the Southeast . Interest in growing and hunting older bucks has also been increasing .

With our mild winters , deer also experience little nutritional stress , allowing for easier physiological maintenance . " Many trophy hunters focus on west-central Illinois , where a strong tradition of passing up younger bucks has developed . Corn , wheat , and soybeans offer food ; hardwood-lined streams feeding the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers provide ample cover . Top counties in this region include Pike , Adams , Brown , Hancock , Greene , Calhoun , Fulton , and Schuyler . A program called Access Illinois Outdoors connects hunters with landowners . Countless record-book bucks have come from these counties . The most impressive is Jerry Bryant 's 291 1/8 nontypical taken on November 15 , 2001 , in Fulton County with a crossbow . NONRESIDENT LICENSE : $280 217-782-6302 ; www.dnr.state.il.us 10 IOWA ( Southeast ) " I never saw that one , but it 's certainly possible , " says Iowa game warden Don Simonson about a monstrous nontypical reportedly hit by a car at night in southeastern Iowa . " I 've seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 240 . " Those uncommon bucks are particularly impressive , bearing in mind that Iowa is famous for its " clean " racks and high-scoring typical deer . In fact , the state has given up 19 of the top 100 typical bucks of all time , more than any other state or Canadian province . " Southeast Iowa may well produce the next world record , " predicts Tom Miller , president of the North American Shed Hunters Club . " Considering the recent mild winters , it could come soon . It 's an area that has yet to reach its full potential . " Recent record-book entries include a 237 3/8 from Monroe County and a 221 7/8 from Jefferson County , both taken in 2000 . Rifle hunting is not allowed , and the main shotgun season comes after the rut , when bucks are less vulnerable . Much of this region is rugged with steep hills and deep brushy draws between fertile farmfields . " Most Iowa hunters use the post and drive method , " says deer biologist Willie Suchy , " but if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near food sources is productive .

Starting with a base of mineral-rich soils , farm crops , steep draws , thick cover , and top-notch genetics , hunters have created a trophy deer paradise by shooting plenty of does and allowing bucks to mature . The result : more bucks in the record books than any other county in the nation , including Wisconsin 's No. 1 nontypical , a massive 245 whitetail with 27-inch main beams and a 27-inch outside spread . What is particularly intriguing is the fact that most of these record deer have been harvested in recent years , like a 200 nontypical bagged in 2000 and a 178 4/8 typical in 2001 . Most of Buffalo County is private , but some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or booking a guided hunt . Several wildlife areas also offer public hunting , including Whitman Dam , 2,173 acres ; Big Swamp , 760 acres ; and Tiffany , encompassing both sides of the Chippewa River , with 12,740 acres . Stand hunting near travel lanes or rutting sign is the method of choice , but drives are also productive .

" At that time people did n't pay much attention to horns . We knew they were big but did n't know anything about scoring or how they would rank .

The state 's top deer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also in northern Minnesota . Bucks in this wild north country grow big partly because of the lightly hunted , remote land , and partly due to a cold-climate adaptive mechanism ( known as Bergmann 's rule ) . St. Louis County , east of where Stewart bagged his massive typical , has produced more than 60 B &C; bucks . Recent records include a 179 7/8 typical from Beltrami County in 2001 and a 212 1/8 nontypical from Koochiching County in 2000 . " The winters of 1995-96 and ' 96-97 were severe , but since then they have mostly been very mild , " says research biologist Mark Lenarz . " The deer have recovered strongly , maybe too strongly . We might have trouble controlling them . " Lenarz estimates that 60 to 70 percent of northern Minnesota is open for public hunting  --  literally millions of acres . Much of it lies in Superior and Chippewa National Forests , but large state forests and timber-company lands offer thousands of additional acres .

Both the Pine Ridge and the Sandhills units are good regions , with river systems such as the Niobrara , Snake , and White being particularly productive  --  and not just for whitetails . Sioux , Dawes , and Sheridan are among the best mule deer counties in the state as well .

Another is that this 20-million-acre ecological zone stretching from just below San Antonio to the Mexican border is carpeted with high-protein brush and thick cover . But it 's mainly the management system that allows bucks to reach full maturity before they are harvested that produces such outstanding results .

To make him enjoy handing me the police reports so much it did not cross his mind that he did not need to do it . <p> " Are you crying ? " he asked , concern in his gray eyes . No getting past Fritz , the experienced detective . <p> " A cold . " I wiped my wet face with my wet hand . I hated to lie to him , but Fritz ran everything by the book . He would neither understand , nor forgive , passing off my papers , even to save Sarah . " A cold and the rain . " <p> He took a clean , white handkerchief out of his uniform pocket and handed it to me . It smelled of starch from Bettina 's wifely care . " Thank you , " I said , wiping my cheeks . " Anything interesting ? " <p> Like every Monday , I had come to the police station to sift through the weekend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berliner Tageblatt , looking for a tale of horror to titillate our readers . Mondays were the best times for fresh reports . People got up to more trouble on weekends , and at the full moon . Ernst 's photograph flashed through my head . He too , had got up to more trouble on the weekend . I swallowed my grief and handed Fritz his handkerchief . <p> Fritz shook his head . " We found a few floaters last weekend . " He walked behind the wooden counter that separated his work area from the public area . " Mostly vagrants , I think . Probably a few from a new power struggle between criminal rings , but we 'll not prove it . " <p> I held my face stiff , using the polite smile I 'd mastered as a child . I was grateful for the beatings , slappings , and pinchings I 'd received from my parents . They had taught me to hold this face no matter what my real thoughts and feelings . Ernst had mocked me for it . Everything he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head . And now he was dead . I gulped , once more fighting for control . Fritz furrowed his brow . He suspected something was wrong , in spite of my best efforts . <p> " Anything worth my time ? " I said to Fritz , because that is what I would have said on any other day . <p> " A group of Nazis beat a Communist almost to death , but that 's not news . " <p> " Not news , " I said . " But newsworthy , even though the Tageblatt will not run it . Someone should care what the Nazis are doing . " <p> " We care , " Fritz said . " But the courts let them go faster than we can arrest them . " <p> He turned and walked to a large oak file cabinet . As he sorted through folders I took a few steadying breaths . <p> " Here we go . " He pulled out a stack of papers . <p> I leaned against the counter and tried to look composed . <p> Fritz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers . " Not much , I 'm afraid . " <p> " Hey ! " called a high- pitched male voice behind Fritz . " You must not give her those reports . " A small man with erect military bearing rushed over to us and snatched the papers from my hand . " Who are you ? " <p> Fritz looked worried . " She 's Hannah Vogel , with the Berliner Tageblatt . " <p> " You have identification ? " He stared at me with dark crow 's eyes . His thick black hair was perfectly in order , his suit meticulously pressed . <p> " Of course , " I said . My identification rested in Sarah 's purse on a boat in the middle of the ocean . I rummaged through my satchel for show , grief replaced again by fear . <p> " I 've known her since she was seventeen years old , " Fritz said . <p> The man ignored him and snapped his fingers at me . " Papers , please . " <p> " They must be here somewhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things out of my satchel : a green notebook , a clean handkerchief , a jade- colored fountain pen that Ernst bought for me after he left home . <p> " What do you do at the Tageblatt ? " His tone sounded accusatory . He leaned closer to me . I yearned to back away , but forced myself to remain still , like someone with nothing to hide . <p> " Crime reporter , " I answered , looking up . " Under the name of Peter Weill . " <p> " The Peter Weill ? " His tone shifted . He was a fan . <p> " For the past several years , " I said . " I have worked closely with the police all that time . " <p> I pulled my press pass out of my satchel and handed it to him , then flipped open my sketchbook to a courtroom sketch published in the paper a week ago . <p> His face creased in a smile . " I remember that picture . Your line work is quite accomplished . " He returned my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Thank you , " I said . " It 's so rare that anyone notices . You have a discerning eye . " <p> Fritz suppressed a smile when the man stood up even straighter and held out his hand . <p> " Kommissar Lang . " <p> I wiped my palm on my skirt before shaking his hand . " Good to meet you . " <p> " The plea sure is mine . " He rocked back on the heels of his highly polished shoes . " Your articles have astute insight into the criminal mind . And the measures we must take in order to protect good German people from the wrong elements . " <p> " I try to do a good , fair job by getting my information from the source . " I glanced at the reports in his hand . <p> He bowed and handed them to me . " So many reporters these days speak only to victims . Or criminals . " <p> " They are important sources as well . " I took the reports with a hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " You have such insight into the male mind . You and your husband must be very close . " <p> " She 's never been married , " Fritz said . The corners of his mouth twitched with a suppressed smile . <p> " Might you autograph an article for me ? " Kommissar Lang clasped his hands behind his back and leaned forward . " Do you have an article in today 's paper ? " <p> I had not yet read today 's paper . " I am not certain . " <p> " Yesterday 's , " Fritz said . " Front page . " <p> " I will procure a copy . " Kommissar Lang hastened out of the room . Fritz returned to his desk without saying a word . His shoulders twitched with laughter , but he kept a serious face . It cost me , but I gave him the expected warning smile . <p> When I glanced down at the reports , I saw gibberish . Lines of black type ran along the paper , but my mind could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I pretended to take notes , but I hoped Fritz could not see that from his desk . I willed myself to think of nothing but numbers and stared at the second hand of my watch , silently counting each tick . When three minutes elapsed , I put the unread reports down on the counter . " You are correct , Fritz , " I said . " Not much there . " <p> I would find no report of a sensational murder or string of robberies for Peter Weill 's byline today . And the murder I most wanted to research I could not ask a single question about . No attention dared fall on Ernst or me . If Sarah and her son were still underway , they might be arrested . Because of her political activism , she had been denied immigration to the United States three times . But it was becoming harder for even apolitical Jews to leave Germany . If the National Socialists , the Nazis , were to gain the majority in the Reichstag , I shuddered to think what would happen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgusting as I found it , I had to admit that Hitler was far too clever at using it for his political ends . Things would get worse before they got better . <p> I turned and marched back down the hall , willing myself not to glance at the photograph . If I did not look , perhaps it would not be true . <p> " Fraulein Vogel , " called Kommissar Lang . I heard him sprinting after me . <p> Something was amiss . Would he demand to see my papers again , papers I still did not have ? I envisioned bolting through the front door of the police station , but instead I turned to him , ready to concoct a story of lost papers . <p> " You forgot my autograph , " he panted . <p> " I do apologize . " Relief flooded over me . " It slipped my mind . I am so late for the Becker trial . " <p> Kommissar Lang nodded . " The rapist who targeted schoolgirls in the park ? " <p> " That one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his involvement in the case , but today I needed to get away before I broke down . <p> He thrust the paper at me . <p> " I apologize in advance if there 's anything inaccurate . My editor has a leaden touch . " <p> He handed me a pen . " Come to my office and sign it . " He gestured back down the hallway , past the photograph of Ernst . If I followed him , I knew that he would regale me with tales of his arrests and later be offended that I did not write each one for the Tageblatt . I had been through that with countless police officers , and afterward they were never much use as sources . <p> I placed his newspaper against the wall and signed it . " I must be at the court house early . It is best to watch the accused come in and sit down . One learns so much . " <p> He nodded . " One can determine a great deal from watching someone walk . " <p> I handed him back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to let the wobble in my knees betray me . <p> Outside , a gust of wind tried to rip the umbrella out of my hands , but I held on , cursing and half- crying as I stumbled across cobblestones to the subway . I pushed my way down concrete stairs , against the crush of people going to work . They chattered and laughed together , gleeful in the mundane details of their lives . I wanted only to go home and be alone . <p> Pictures of Ernst flashed by in my head . The most painful images were from his childhood . He 'd been a wonderful child and , later , a great friend . I leaned against the wall of the subway station , face turned toward the tile , and sobbed , safely alone in the crowd . When I could stand and walk again , I did . <p> Once aboard the train I collapsed on the wooden seat and drew a deep breath . I ran my fingers over the oak slats of the bench . The wood was blond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces hidden behind twin newspapers , sat two men in black fedoras . One man read the Berliner Tageblatt , the other the Vlkische Beobachter , that Nazirag . <p> Excerpted from A Trace of Smoke by Rebecca Cantrell . Copyright 2009 by Rebecca Cantrell .
