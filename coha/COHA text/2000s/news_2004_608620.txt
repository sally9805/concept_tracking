It also wrote down $159 million to shut down projects worldwide , including in Latin America . <p> The changes included the chairman , Roger W. Sant , stepping down in May ; he is still on the board . He was succeeded by Richard G. Darman , former director of the White House Office of Management and Budget and a partner in the high-powered investment outfit Carlyle Group . The company also recruited other new board members , including former Internal Revenue commissioner Charles O.

Wraase <p> Employees : 5,719 <p> Local employees : 1,814 <p> DESCRIPTION : Pepco Holdings sells electricity and gas to 1.8 million customers in the mid-Atlantic , from the District to southern New Jersey . At the end of last year the company 's District-based utility was delivering electricity to 725,000 customers while its Delaware-based Conectiv unit provided electricity to 1.1 million customers and gas to 100,000 customers . Pepco Holdings also owns two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that compete for retail power customers . <p> DEVELOPMENTS : For Pepco it was a tumultuous year marked by key personnel turnover , contract disputes and Hurricane Isabel . <p> In March the utility shut down its trading operations after disclosing that it had lost $20 million a month earlier . The unregulated trading operation was part of Pepco 's Conectiv Energy subsidiary in Wilmington , Del . <p> The trading unit lost money because of a confluence of factors : Gas prices soared when natural gas inventories were depleted in part by cold weather ; and Conectiv traders were " short , " which meant they faced future obligations to purchase gas as prices were rising sharply . <p> Meanwhile , in June , John M. Derrick Jr . retired as chief executive of the electric utility , handing the reins to another longtime Pepco executive , Dennis R. Wraase , its president . ( Derrick , who is 63 years old , is retiring as chairman following the utility 's board meeting this spring . ) <p> In the fall Pepco hired James Lee Witt , a former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to assess the company 's response to Hurricane Isabel in September . <p> Customers criticized Pepco for taking more than 10 days to fully restore service knocked out by the storm . Isabel cost Pepco $40 million in equipment damage , restoration expenses and personnel costs and left 545,000 of Pepco 's 725,000 customers without power . <p> In the fall Pepco also agreed to pay $60 million more than it had contracted for power for its District and Maryland customers over the ensuing 14 months . The higher price was in part the result of Pepco 's renegotiated deal with Mirant , which bought Pepco 's largest power plants in 2000 . Mirant had agreed to sell electricity back to Pepco at a discount for four years . But Mirant , which produces most of the power used by Pepco customers , has been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since July . <p> This January , in an attempt to focus on its core business , Pepco said it was getting out of the telecommunications and cable television business , selling its 50 percent stake in Starpower Communications . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the sale after having invested $141 million . <p> 101 Constitution Ave .

It was 20 percent colder last year than in normal years based on historical average temperatures . That was a reversal from 2002 , when the region 's weather was 13 percent warmer than usual . <p> With the colder weather last year , demand for gas rose . Utility revenue for the fiscal year rose 40 percent to $1.3 billion .
