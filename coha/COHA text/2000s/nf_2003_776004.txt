New Dance : America 's Pioneers // AROUND THE TURN of the twentieth century , a new form of solo art dance-also called " aesthetic " or , occasionally , " barefoot " dance-began to appear on the stages of Europe and America . Some of the things that made it new were its seriousness of purpose , the use of concert music as an accompaniment , and an innovative approach to dance technique , in which the rigorous codes of ballet and the exhibitionistic high kicks of the music hall played no part . There was also freedom in dress-the dancers wore loose , uncorseted garments , revealed bare limbs , and danced without toe shoes . Their hair was unconfined . Four women-Loie Fuller , Isadora Duncan , Ruth St. Denis , and the less famous Maud Allan-arrived independently at this new way to dance ; they are considered the forerunners of the modern era . ( Indeed , the first two became so well known that they are often popularly referred to by their first names only . ) Although all were born in North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receptive climate of Europe . Within just a few years , each was widely imitated on both continents . In creating a new identity , for dance , touring the world in the dissemination of their art , establishing schools to educate a new generation , and publishing books about their artistic goals and discoveries , they also represented an early form of New Woman-strong , independent , physically daring , self-sufficient . In much of what they did , they lacked role models of any kind . // It is popularly believed that these creators of a new dance were rebelling against " the ballet . " But none , during her formative years , was in a position to see any ballet worthy of the name . The glories of the Russian repertory , which starred highly trained ballerinas displaying the latest elements of technical virtuosity , were an ocean away ; thus , most Americans associated the dancer 's art with tawdry showpieces featuring plump women in tightly laced corsets who were massed together in routines resembling military drills . And there were almost no men ; even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts were danced by women en travestie . // Dance of one sort or another flourished in vaudeville , but this was not considered a high-class setting , even when graced by such stars as Sarah Bernhardt and Mrs. Patrick Campbell ( and later by Fred Astaire and Marilyn Miller ) . For even the most distinguished performers played at least two shows a day , sharing variety programs with high-wire acts , roller-skating teams , animals , female impersonators , card-trick players , and so on , endlessly . // Then there were spectacle extravaganzas , forerunners of revue and musical comedy , which blended fairy-tale drama , song , dance , and vast tableaux and processions with the latest stage technology to create a phantasmagoria of theatrical marvels . The enterprising Kiralfy brothers produced some of the most elaborate blockbusters : in 1883 there was Excelsior , which glorified the march of technology ; in 1888 Nero , or The Fall of Rome required a cast of 2,000 . ( A pageant about Egypt produced by Imre Kiralfy was seen by the young Ruth St. Denis . ) The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel but was assembled from local talent-a hundred girls or more , mostly untrained . With dance episodes considered little more than leg shows , technical standards could not have been high . ( When Florenz Ziegfeld came along to take up the tradition in 1907 , he was hailed as " that promulgator of new century riots of color , Frenchiness , and female pulchritude , seasoned with music and song . " ) In short , dancing existed to titillate , decorate , or entertain-never to edify . And to dance was considered virtual prostitution . It was this prevailing state of affairs , rather than " the ballet , " that drove the early dancers to evolve an art of self-expression , spiritual significance , and dignity . As Isadora Duncan declared in 1908 , " It is to revive the lost art of dancing that I have devoted my life . " // The fact that Americans had so few informed ideas about what dancing could or should be might have been an auspicious circumstance for anyone wanting to experiment , had it not been for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Resistance to dance innovation in America has usually been attributed to a legacy of Puritan anti-theatrical prejudice , which focused on the physicality of dance , and although there is some substance to this explanation , even in puritanical America the moral establishment accepted the idea that art and the theater-and even certain kinds of dancing-could be uplifting . Indeed , it was largely through the efforts of a liberal clergy that the arts in general achieved any social respectability . But there was also an attitude of moral austerity among the middle class and intellectuals . Both groups tended to associate art with decadent aristocratic political systems and with luxury and hedonistic tastes , all of which they perceived as a threat to the democratic experiment . Had they been able to foresee the egalitarian stance that modern dance would eventually take , they would no doubt have welcomed it sooner . // Female reformers in late nineteenth-century America supported the notion that vigorous exercise was essential to physical and spiritual well-being and could be accomplished in an aesthetic mode . Young women studied elocution and public speaking in academies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aesthetic Dancing ( a system loosely based on balletic forms ) , German or Swedish gymnastics , or the " harmonic gymnastics " of the American Delsarte system . All of these reflected principles absorbed by the modernist forerunners , and the progression to an experimental free style of dancing in America seemed assured . It was slow in coming , however . // In the meantime , the idea that women were intellectually capable and educable had awakened the possibility that the feminine point of view might be unique and worth expressing . Women stuck to their gymnastics , statue posing , tableaux vivants , and " free " or " interpretive " dancing , and by 1910 , helped by considerable progress in dress reform , they were pumping bicycles , learning to hike , swim , and canoe , and playing lawn tennis . When , two decades later , American modern dance offered the opportunity for real expression , American women possessed the most important attributes : a disquieted mind , irrepressible enthusiasm , and strong , supple bodies . // Though Isadora Duncan is usually given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Loie Fuller 's fame preceded hers by a decade , and Fuller 's niche beside Duncan is secure . Loie was not even a dancer by training ( she had taken some six lessons in her life ) . Rather , she was an actress who specialized in male roles ; nevertheless , she is considered the earliest major precursor of modern dance . Loie appeared onstage with bare feet ; sometimes she wore draperies and sometimes flowing dresses , and she always went uncorseted. // Mary Louise Fuller was probably born on January 22 , 1862 , in a tavern in Fullersburg , a small village near Chicago . ( In her years of fame , she delighted in giving journalists many versions of her life , including eight different birth dates . ) Her mother had studied singing briefly , and while still very young , Loie appeared in the chorus of Faust with a Chicago opera company . She claimed to have also been a temperance lecturer and Shakespeare reciter ; during the 1877-78 season , at the age of fifteen or so , she was employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company , and through the decade of the eighties she performed in vaudeville , stock , and burlesque ( usually in pants parts ) , while streamlining her name to Loie . One vehicle , The Arabian Nights , or Aladdin 's Wonderful Lamp , in which she starred as Aladdin in 1887 , was a burlesque spectacle featuring such amazing scenic effects as a " Veil of Vapor , or Steam Curtain " and a " Crypt of Crimson Crystals . " The twinkling crystals were created by a switchboard of electric lights , rare for the time . ( More often gas lighting , carbon arcs , and magic-lantern projections provided illumination . ) Flashed onto gauze hangings , the lights enriched the stunning scenic transformations that were sometimes the raison d ' ? tre for a show . In one of the Arabian Nights ballets , the white costumes of the performers were tinted with rainbow colors by light beamed through two prisms. // Certainly Fuller learned something from the stage " magic " of the jumbled spectacles in which she regularly appeared for fifteen years ( until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the play of light on moving fabric was her dance . Disadvantaged by lack of training as well as by a stocky body , she concentrated on illusionistic effects and the lighting techniques that made them possible . The story of her development belongs as much to the history of stagecraft as to the history of dance , for she was the first to exploit , if not to invent , many elements of modern stage lighting . // Fuller later claimed that in the beginning her dance vocabulary consisted of " twelve characteristic motions . " Film fragments from about 1904 show that she used few jumps ; there were long rushes across the stage and swirling turns and undulations of the arms and torso , along with various waltz steps and skips that one might expect from someone unschooled but adept at assimilation . While continuing the sweeping arm gestures buoying her draperies , she would kneel and extend one leg to the front , bending backward to brush the floor with her hair . In contrast to the ballet of her era , Fuller 's movements seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year of performing in London , Loie appeared in New York in an obscure play , Quack , M.D. , in which she played a woman who was hypnotized by a doctor . For this eerie scene , she improvised a costume of silky transparent fabric illuminated by soft lights that was so long she had to hold it aloft to avoid tripping as she ran back and forth , occasionally spiralling in alternating directions . Then came a solo in another show , Uncle Celestin , in which , after the house lights dimmed ( a rarity in 1892 ) , she performed three dances , each lit by a single color , an effect achieved by placing a piece of colored glass in front of a projector . While in motion , Loie again raised voluminous skirts in the air , and her signature " serpentine dance " was born . ( Although the precise origins of this dance are not known-due , in part , to various versions of the story offered by Loie-it was related to the " skirt dance , " which combined ballet steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English music hall . Loie had appeared with the popular skirt dancer Kate Vaughan while in London. ) // With a suite of five dances , Fuller set sail for Europe and , after an engagement with a circus , arrived in Paris to open at the leading French music hall , the Folies-Berg ? re , on November 5 , 1892 . ( She had hoped to appear at the Op ? ra instead . ) Her program consisted of Serpentine ( to a popular violin piece , " Au loin du bal " ) , Violet , Butterfly , and XXXX , later called La Danse Blanche , and her success with critics and public alike was instantaneous- " a success without precedent in this theater , " according to an opening-night reviewer . Illuminated by multi-colored electric lights , Loie danced in costumes made of yards of China silk , manipulating the material into the air by the velocity of her movements until it billowed and caught the light , fracturing and deflecting it to create the illusion of shimmering flowers , butterflies , clouds , and flames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed , dance of the twentieth century was born . // Following this triumph , Fuller was christened " La F ? e Lumineuse " - " The Fairy of Light " - and the intoxication of watching her was compared to the effects of hashish . After fifteen years on the stage , she had found her art . Her popularity soon led to the appearance of Loie skirts , handkerchiefs , and scarves-even a Loie Fuller stove . When the Folies-Berg ? re closed for the summer , Loie undertook successful tours in London and New York . When she returned to Paris for a second season , she occupied all apartment adjoining the Folies-Berg ? re , where she gave her three-hundredth performance in January 1894. // Fuller was interested in exploring every means of combining color and movement . Her career flourished during a period , 1890-1915 , when phenomenal changes in theater lighting were taking place ; her spectacular illusions would not have been possible without the electric light . As early as 1846 , the arc lamp had provided electricity in theaters for special effects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave theaters an alternative to gas lighting . But the aesthetic , expressive , and theatrical potential of lighting remained undeveloped until Loie began her experimentation . Operating the lights was difficult : an electrician was required to run each one separately because the colored gelatins had to be inserted by hand . Loie achieved special magic by projecting a multi-colored slide , superimposing another on it , and then removing the first . She claimed to use up to thirty-four lamps , operated by fourteen to twenty electricians , whom she directed by such prearranged signals as tapping her heels . // With time her effects became more and more elaborate : the " fiery lighting " of her 1895 Salome was adapted to turn sea into blood for another rendition of Salome in 1907 ; in the Fire Dance ( 1895 ) , which she performed on a glass plate lit from below ( her own invention ) , " shaking and twisting in a torrent of incandescent lava , her long dress spouting flame and rolling around in burning spirals , ... she stood in blazing embers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Loie used no scenery , and she draped the stage , including the floor , in black velvet , so that the theater was in total darkness before her dances began . The complete absence of light was one of her earliest and most dramatic inventions . // Fuller 's costumes were also innovative , and to guard against imitators ( who had appeared even before her great success and were prolific thereafter ) , she astutely patented some of her costumes as well as some of her scenic devices . In 1893 she received a patent for a dress with a simple bodice and very full skirt , as worn in the original Serpentine . A year later she patented a voluminous garment that had wands attached inside the skirt ; these the dancer grasped , thereby obtaining a far greater " reach " in the manipulation of the fabric . Later specifications called for a skirt measuring 120 yards at the hem , made of the finest translucent iridescent silk . In 1895 Loie patented an arrangement of mirrors that framed the performer onstage : lights lined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of many figures . //
