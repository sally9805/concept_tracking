Chapter One Tate McCade stood in the middle of the Alaskan ski lodge , watching the giant-screen television with the crowd of fifty or so people who 'd gathered around for the big event . On screen four women , all blond , all pretty , all wearing daredevil smiles and neon-pink snowsuits prepared to jump out of a helicopter - with nothing but wildly colored snowboards strapped to their feet . The Alpine Angels were at it again . Like many of their stunts , this one included lots of snow , rarely traveled mountain peaks and a high degree of risk . Today , the girls were jumping out of the helicopter from fifty feet in the air , each landing on her own mountain and leaving her " signature , " the trail left in the pristine snow by her snowboard , on the face of the mountain . The four mountains were n't overly tall , but they were sheer as hell . From the peak to the base , the run was almost straight down . Damn . Someone needed to step in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or none of them would live to see their thirtieth birthdays . Tate had planned to arrive early enough to lasso at least one of them before she got on that damned chopper . But his flight , like half the flights in the country , had been late . So now , he was stuck here , standing helplessly with nothing but spit and the hope that the women made it to the bottom in one piece . Tate shifted his gaze from the giant picture to the small family that stood directly in front of the screen . At least there was a halfway decent reason behind this madness . Like most of the other harebrained stunts the Alpine Angels women had performed in the last three years , this one was a fund-raiser . The recipient was the ten-year-old boy sitting in the wheelchair front and center , flanked protectively by his parents . He needed a bone marrow transplant and his family had no insurance to cover the cost . Tate studied the boy . He was small for his age , pale , and looked as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon . But he was a cute kid with a killer smile and there was a sparkle in his eyes that said he was living this minute for all it was worth . If those fool women chose to risk their lives , Tate supposed they could n't have picked a better reason . But he was n't fooling himself . People who pushed the envelope as hard as the Alpine Angels did were usually looking for a way to self-destruct . He hoped to God they would n't manage to do it today . It was the last thing the boy needed to see . And besides , Tate had a promise to keep . He shifted his attention back to the screen . In total surround sound , the whir of the chopper 's blades filled the room and vibrated beneath their feet . The scream of the Alaskan wind howled in their ears . It was probably quieter in the damned helicopter . But even over the steady thump in the floor , he could feel his heart pounding , hear it over the roar of the helicopter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the helicopter 's open door , the statuesque blonde turned to the camera , smiled and gave a thumbs-up . She took a moment to prepare herself and then jumped into nothingness with a shrieking war cry . Tate could n't remember the woman 's name , Mattie or Tasha or ... something . She was n't the Alpine Angel he 'd come to see . But he held his breath for her , just the same , and prayed for a good landing . The screen suddenly flashed , splitting into two portions . Three-quarters of the giant picture remained on the three women left in the helicopter . But a separate picture in the upper right hand corner showed the woman who 'd just jumped . She hit the steep face of the mountain hard , snow flying in all directions , completely obscuring her from view . But when the white powder settled she was on her feet , swooshing down the terrain heading for the bottom of the mountain at breakneck speed . He sighed in relief . One down . Three to go . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling blonde at each , the big screen splitting into more squares with each jump . The three women who 'd already made successful landings were screaming down the sheer faces of their mountains in living Technicolor . Tate shifted his gaze to the left bottom square . The last woman was in place now , leaning out of the helicopter checking the terrain below . Crissy Trevarrow . Or as she knew herself , Crissy Albreit . The woman he 'd come to bring home . She looked back at the camera , her sensuous lips smiling widely , her light green eyes sparkling with excitement and her long curly blond hair blowing in the wind . His breath caught in his throat and the same sensation he 'd gotten the first time he 'd seen her picture , not twenty-four hours ago , hit him hard . It was a feeling not unlike one of his wild mustangs delivering a hard kick to the gut . But this sensation was lower , harder and twice as powerful . He wanted her . Like a stallion scenting a mare , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And equally unwelcome . Because Warner Trevarrow , just before he 'd died , had made Tate promise he 'd not only bring Crissy back to her father 's ranch , but he 'd make sure she had everything that was good and wonderful and bright . And no matter how you saddled that horse , an ex-con did n't fit into any of those categories . ( Continues ... )
