Syron <p> President and COO : Eugene M. McQuade <p> Employees : 5,280 <p> Local employees : 4,864 <p> DESCRIPTION : Chartered by the federal government , Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. , known as Freddie Mac , has a mandate to promote affordable housing and the availability of funds for home mortgages . Like its rival Fannie Mae , it serves as an intermediary between the financial markets and institutions that issue home mortgages . The company borrows money from investors to buy mortgages from banks and savings and loans . It also packages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Under new leadership , Freddie Mac remained on a slow road to recovery from an accounting scandal that erupted in January 2003 and toppled two chief executives before that year had ended . <p> The crisis exposed problems so deep that Freddie Mac did not resume issuing financial reports on a timely basis , one of the basic requirements of any public company , until last month . It made a start on March 31 by issuing its 2004 results , bringing its financial reporting current two years after the scandal broke . <p> Freddie 's earnings fell 41 percent in 2004 , mostly because the market value of key parts of its portfolio dropped $4.48 billion . Large fees paid to accountants and consultants during the year also dragged down earnings . <p> Freddie earned $2.83 billion ( $3.78 a share ) in 2004 , compared with $4.82 billion ( $6.68 ) in 2003 . <p> Freddie is expected to begin reporting regular quarterly results in August , when it plans to report first- and second-quarter 2005 numbers . <p> An overhaul of Freddie 's internal controls and accounting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , chief executive Richard F. Syron said . <p> The company has employed an army of consultants and has been spending heavily to rebuild its flawed accounting and financial reporting systems . For example , Freddie reported last fall that its audit expenses had ballooned to $46.1 million in 2003 from $4.3 million in 2002 , and it reported that it had already been billed an additional $41.2 million in audit fees in 2004 for the completion of the 2003 audit . <p> The process has delayed Freddie 's plans to voluntarily submit to regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission , from which it is exempt . Freddie plans to register with the SEC in the second quarter of 2006 . <p> The company issued its 2003 results last June . " We really wanted to slow down and get it right , " spokesman Michael Cosgrove said . Syron , who joined Freddie from Thermo Electron Corp. , recruited new top executives . <p> Although Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are separate companies , their reputations seem tightly bound . Just over a year after Fannie Mae 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the accounting problems at Freddie Mac , the recovering Freddie was suffering some collateral damage from a similar scandal at Fannie . Freddie Mac 's outlook was clouded by lawmakers ' renewed vows to tighten regulation of the two companies and by new regulations from the Department of Housing and Urban Development requiring Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae to devote more of their funding to affordable housing for low-income home buyers and other targeted groups . <p> 1680 Capital One Dr. <p> McLean , Va . 22102 <p> 703-720-1000 <p> www.capitalone.com <p> Founded : 1995 <p> Revenue : $10.69 billion <p> Net income : $1.54 billion <p> Earnings per share : $6.21 <p> Dividend : 11 cents <p> Stockholder equity : $8.39 billion <p> Auditor : Ernst &; Young LLP <p> Stock : COF ( NYSE ) <p> Assets : $53.75 billion <p> Market capitalization : $18.49 billion <p> 52-week high : $84.75 ( 1/3/2005 ) <p> 52-week low : $61.15 ( 5/10/2004 ) <p> Chairman and CEO : Richard D.

The company , which marked its 10th anniversary in 2004 , grew into a giant in this industry by figuring out how to get its credit cards into the wallets of people with less-than-perfect credit ratings . <p> DEVELOPMENTS : Capital One worried some analysts by spending about $511 million in marketing during the fourth quarter of 2004  --  more than some of the company 's larger rivals  --  to become known as the credit card company with the ad slogan , " What 's in your wallet ? " <p> Most of the company 's revenue comes from its credit card business , and the company regularly introduces new types of cards , such as an airline travel credit card called " Go Miles " that lets customers earn flight miles on any airline . <p> The company is diversifying its interests , though . In 2004 , Capital One signed definitive agreements to acquire HFS Group , a British-based equity loan broker and Onyx Acceptance Corp. , an auto lender . This year , Capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kansas for $155 million in cash , and the retail bank Hibernia Corp . of New Orleans for $5.35 billion . The Hibernia deal gives Capital One its first network of branches  --  Hibernia has more than 300 locations in Louisiana and Texas  --  and marks the first time a credit card company has bought a banking company ( the reverse is more common ) . Capital One first said in 2003 that it was interested in buying a retail bank to diversify its balance sheet . <p> The company suffered its share of public relations embarrassments last year as well . In July , the Securities and Exchange Commission filed an insider-trading lawsuit against former chief financial officer David M. Willey , accusing him of improperly selling stock before possible regulatory actions were taken against the company in 2002 . Willey allegedly made more than $1 million from the sale , which was made in advance of a negative review by bank inspectors . <p> In December , Minnesota 's attorney general sued two subsidiaries of the company , contending that ads for their " No Hassle " credit cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capital One 's cards , unlike competing cards , would bear interest rates that remain at 4.99 percent . However , the suit alleged , customers were surprised to find their interest rates jumped to as much as 25.9 percent if they were late in paying their bills . <p> 12061 Bluemont Way <p> Reston , Va . 20190 <p> 703-810-3000 <p> www.salliemae.com <p> Founded : 1972 <p> Revenue : $5.22 billion <p> Net income : $1.91 billion <p> Earnings per share : $4.04 <p> Dividend : 74 cents <p> Stockholder equity : $3.10 billion <p> Auditor : PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP <p> Stock : SLM ( NYSE ) <p> Assets : $84.09 billion <p> Market capitalization : $20.85 billion <p> 52-week high : $55.13 ( 1/4/2005 ) <p> 52-week low : $36.43 ( 7/23/2004 ) <p> Chairman : Edward A.

Lord <p> Employees : 9,128 <p> Local employees : 783 <p> DESCRIPTION : SLM , founded in 1972 as the government-sponsored Student Loan Marketing Association and nicknamed Sallie Mae , has evolved into a private education financial services firm . It originates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also private loans for students and parents from kindergarten through college . It offers a range of other financial services , including debt-collection , home mortgages and consulting for institutions on how to attract and retain students . <p> DEVELOPMENTS : Last year , SLM completed the privatization process it began in 1997 , reaching final agreement with the Treasury Department four years ahead of schedule to end the last of its ties to the federal government , an " honorable discharge , " as chief executive Albert L. Lord put it . <p> Last year , the company originated a record $18 billion in loans through its own or affiliated brands . Although federally guaranteed loans continued to predominate , and were worth more than $13 billion of that figure , private loans leaped 32 percent to about $4.5 billion . Overall the company 's portfolio of loans under management grew 21 percent to $107 billion . <p> At the same time , SLM has continued to acquire competitors and firms in related fields . Last year , it completed the acquisition of Seattle-based Student Loan Finance Association and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Phoenix-based Southwest Student Services Corp . and its $4.8 billion portfolio for $533 million . It also bought a majority interest in Arrow Financial Services , a company that buys and seeks to collect debt that has been written off as uncollectable by the original lender . <p> Its new subsidiaries are allowing the company to expand beyond its traditional education-related markets . For example , one of its debt-collection companies last year won a contract to collect back taxes for the state of Ohio . <p> SLM also announced plans for a loan program for foreign students studying in the United States . This program will be modeled on the company 's offerings for American students studying abroad , the company said . <p> 1001 19th St. North <p> Arlington , Va . 22209 <p> 703-312-9500 <p> www.fbr.com <p> Founded : 1989 <p> Revenue : $1.05 billion <p> Net income : $349.56 million <p> Earnings per share : $2.07 <p> Dividend : $1.53 <p> Stockholder equity : $1.58 billion <p> Auditor : PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP <p> Stock : FBR ( NYSE ) <p> Assets : $12.93 billion <p> Market capitalization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> 52-week low : $13.56 ( 4/5/2005 ) <p> Co-CEO : Emanuel J.

It had a mortgage-backed securities portfolio worth more than $11 billion at the end of 2004 . <p> The company hopes to increase the profitability of its mortgage-backed securities business by buying more high-yielding securities that do n't conform to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac standards . <p> This year , it bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so-called " non-conforming " mortgages . <p> In the past year , FBR solidified its dominance in investment banking services for mid-size real estate and financial service firms . It raised equity for a number of real estate investment trusts , including several local firms : JER Investors Trust Inc. , DiamondRock Hospitality Co. and Fieldstone Investment Corp . All told , FBR participated in 21 initial stock offerings that raised $4.2 billion in equity for companies . It also raised $3.4 billion in private placements , mostly through offerings in which FBR sold stock in new companies to its many institutional investors . These offerings typically lead to an initial public offering later . <p> One of FBR 's largest such deals in 2004 was KKR Financial Corp. , a real estate investment trust sponsored by New York leveraged buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &; Co. ; that deal raised $780 million . <p> On April 4 , co-chief executive Emanuel J. Friedman abruptly announced his departure effective June 9 . The company and Friedman did not disclose the reason for the resignation .

It also invests in commercial real estate loans . <p> DEVELOPMENTS : Allied Capital is the oldest , and one of the biggest , in the class of companies known as business development companies , or BDCs . It raises money from stock sales and borrowings that it then uses to make loans to and invest in private companies . It pays out nearly all of its investment income and whatever gains it makes when it sells investments to shareholders in the form of dividends . <p> In 2002 and 2003 , the company was beset by frequent public squabbles with short-sellers  --  investors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over how the company recognized income and valued its investments . Last year , the climate quieted down , though the fallout from earlier years continued . <p> The Department of Justice and the U.S. attorney 's office in Washington have asked the company to provide documents for a criminal investigation involving its largest investment , the New York small-business lender Business Loan Express LLC . Short-sellers and other investors have criticized Allied 's valuation of Business Loan Express and questioned an asset transfer deal between Allied and the company . <p> Financially , however , Allied has moved forward . The yield on its portfolio of loan and investments has held steady at slightly more than 14 percent for the past four years , and the company 's profit has grown in each of the past four years . Though its biggest investment is in Business Loan Express , most of Allied 's capital is deployed in mid-size industrial , consumer-product and business-service firms . <p> Like its smaller competitors , Allied Capital in 2004 began to put more money in its own controlled buyouts instead of simply making loans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center <p> Bethesda , Md. 20814 <p> 301-951-6122 <p> www.american-capital.com <p> Founded : 1986 <p> Revenue : $336.08 million <p> Net income : $281.45 million <p> Earnings per share : $3.63 <p> Dividend : $2.91 <p> Stockholder equity : $1.87 billion <p> Auditor : Ernst &; Young LLP <p> Stock : ACAS ( Nasdaq ) <p> Assets : $3.49 billion <p> Market capitalization : $2.86 billion <p> 52-week high : $35.70 ( 2/17/2005 ) <p> 52-week low : $24.70 ( 5/17/2004 ) <p> Chairman and CEO : Malon Wilkus <p> COO : Ira Wagner <p> Employees : 191 <p> Local employees : 120 <p> DESCRIPTION : American Capital Strategies is in a dividend-paying class of publicly traded firm known as a business development company .
