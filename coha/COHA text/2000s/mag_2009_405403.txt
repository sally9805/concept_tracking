Where 's the sunscreen ? The palest man on television -- and new TONIGHT SHOW host -- warms up to life in L.A. THE BOSS During a 2006 Late Night visit , " Bruce Springsteen insisted I play guitar with him , " O'Brien says . THE DOLL Home is where the gnome is . This troll doll was a gift from a Late Night with Conan O'Brien admirer . THE BLOCKHEAD The papier-mch bust of a robotized Conan debuted in a White Stripes YouTube video . THE BOARD Where do all the laughs come from ? O'Brien uses Post-its to plan segments for his upcoming shows . THE CLOCK A fan sent O'Brien this cuckoo clock . The twist ? At the top of every hour , a Conan head springs out . As he prepares to slide into Jay Leno 's chair on June 1 , becoming the new host of The Tonight Show , Conan O'Brien is learning to love his new hometown of Los Angeles . " I 'm flying down the 405 freeway at night and the windows are down , " says O'Brien , 46 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love L.A. ' " Though sometimes it feels more like tough love , after spending the last 16 years living in New York City , where he hosted Late Night with Conan O'Brien . " It 's hard to bump into people here , " says O'Brien , who moved west with wife Liza , 38 , and kids Neve , 5 , and Beckett , 3 . " In New York people would come up to me on the street and say , ' Hey , Conan ! ' and I 'm a talker with no sense of personal space , so I 'm very happy to talk . Here in Los Angeles the only way I 'm going to meet new people is if I accidentally get into their car . " Or if they turn on Tonight . O'Brien sat with PEOPLE 's Pamela Warrick to talk about how he and his family are adjusting to life on the left coast . What 's a typical L.A. day for you ? My day begins with a bath in SPF 75 , and I sit in it for 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put on a reflective suit and , here 's the worst part , I get into a convertible to drive to work . That makes no sense . Speaking of L.A. 's freeways , how are you dealing with road rage ? I throw produce out my window at cars that anger me . Have you bought a firearm yet ? I have not . I have a golden retriever . Someone told me that in Los Angeles , you either buy a gun or get a dog . What have you been doing to de-stress as your Tonight Show debut approaches ? I play with my kids . They do n't care that I 'm taking over The Tonight Show . They just want me to chase them up the stairs and throw them in the clothes hamper . Do your kids still eat meat or have they already gone vegan ? My son will eat anything . He 's like a caveman , he 'll eat a shoulder of bison . My daughter is still in that picky phase where she 'll only eat a saltine cracker and string @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mug -- like with Dwight Eisenhower on it . She 's trying to control the world . How are they adjusting to the move ? My daughter Neve is 5 , and my son Beckett is 3 . At first it was a big change for them . But , especially the boy -- he 's so young if I can keep him out here a couple more weeks , that 'll account for like 40 percent of his life . He 'll soon forget he ever lived in New York . It 's going to be a lot different from your Boston childhood ! That 's what I 'm worried about : My children will grow up in Los Angeles , and I wo n't be able to relate to them . I grew up in the Northeast , and I went to school in the dark , and everyone looked like they had tuberculosis . Out here everybody looks great . They 're all wearing yoga pants and hiking and doing lunges on the beach . Do you exercise ? I always like to jump on my bike , and there 's great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put on my helmet and my glasses , but the people with the cameras ... You mean the paparazzi ? Yeah , they 're very good . I think I could have my face completely bandaged and those guys would know who I am . The first two weeks I was here , I 'd be riding my bike and there 'd be a car in front of me with a video camera . People say our economy is in trouble , but if someone makes money off footage of me riding a bike , our economy is in great shape . Spotted any celebs around town ? Seeing big celebrities doing mundane things is great . Like George Clooney squeezing the broccoli at a Ralphs market . I love the contrast of rich , famous icons buying , like , Dr. Scholl 's insoles . Then I was at a gym and I turn around and there 's Sylvester Stallone -- I watched a Rocky montage come to life in front of me . A few days ago I was driving home and I see a convertible driving the other way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's being done for your benefit . Like there 's a director somewhere saying , " Here comes Conan ! Cue Schwarzenegger . " Have you caught any of L.A. 's infamous car chases yet ? I might have to initiate one . To get people to watch my first show , I 'm going to commit a crime and have the police chase me . I 'll lead them to Universal Studios .
