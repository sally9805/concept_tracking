The Lost By Jack Ketchum Dorchester Publishing Jack Ketchum Friday , August 1 , 1969 The Cat/Schilling The cat dodged Charlie Schilling 's feet as he made his way across the parking lot to Panik 's Bar and Grille . The cat was two years old , amber-eyed and mostly black except for a patch of white to one side of her nose and white paws and another white patch on her belly . She was hungry but then she was mostly hungry and had been for three months now since her owners , two young newlyweds from Hopatcong , had driven her to Sparta and dropped her off on the quiet street behind Paul 's Deli and driven away . Their new baby daughter was allergic . The cat did n't know about allergies , only that where once she 'd been well-fed and warm and cared for by humans whose presence rather comforted her now she was alone and cold nights and nearly always felt a rumble in her belly . She dodged Schilling 's feet because Shilling was a big man and unfamiliar and big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have dreamt of kicking her and certainly not today . He walked into the yellow twilight of the bar and Ed Anderson was just where he 'd expected him to be , down at the end of the bar leaning over a Bud and talking to Teddy Panik , who owned the place . It was four-thirty , Happy Hour , and it was Ed 's practice to leave no Happy Hour at Panik 's Bar and Grille until six o'clock when it was over . Ed called it Going to the Meeting . He 'd never attended a business meeting in all his fifty-two years but celebrating that fact was precisely the point . He walked past Dave Lenhart and Phil Preston and said hi to Billy Altman and Sam Heinz and Walter Earle who interrupted their conversation about who made more money , Willie Shoemaker or Lew Alcindor to say hello back to him and sat down on the stool next to Ed . Teddy poured him his usual Dewar 's and soda and both he and Ed knew Charlie well enough to see that something was n't right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was Ed who finally asked . " She died , " Charlie said . " Who ? " " Elise Hanlon . Life support all these years and what was the point . Word came to the station a little after noon . " " Aw hell , Charlie . I 'm sorry to hear that . " " You know I went to see her about a month ago and it looked to me like she was already dead . Nothing but skin and bones . But she would n't let go . Or they would n't let her let go . Another one , Teddy . " " Sure . " He stared straight ahead at the faded blowup of Bogie as Sam Spade over the register . Bogie was flanked by Gehrig and Mantle . Behind him over the cigarette machine the neon Miller sign was buzzing again . He thought that Teddy should either fix the damn thing or throw it out . The buzzing was a pain in the ass . But Teddy was partial to Miller and sold a lot of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody but him and Ed . It called itself the Champagne of Bottled Beers but to him it tasted like panther piss . Weak panther piss at that . He was n't going to kick a cat but trashing a neon sign probably would suit his mood exactly . Except he could n't do that to Teddy . Teddy was hooked on panther piss and they paid him to hang the sign . " We worked like hell on that one , Charlie . You know we did . " " Yeah , we did . And look where it went . Down the toilet . " " Absolutely true . " " My partner along with it . " " Absolutely untrue , my friend . " Charlie looked at him . Ed was the most decent , honest guy he 'd ever met and he 'd never known him to kid himself about anything . Well , maybe about one thing-Sally Richmond . But he thought he was kidding himself about this . " What are you telling me ? That 's not the reason you left the department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I left the department because I was tired . Not because of Elise Hanlon or Lisa Steiner or even Ray Pye . " Pye was the kid they 'd tried to nail on it . Except that Pye would n't nail . " We 've had this talk before , Charlie . I 'll give it to you one more time . I wo n't say it was n't a factor . Sure it was a factor . But I put on the uniform ten years earlier than you . Plus I 've got six years on you age-wise . Let me refresh you , my friend . When I started out in this town you did n't lock your doors , you left ' em open even if you were n't home in case the neighbors needed something , pliers or a cup of milk or something and you were n't around to loan it to them . You did n't worry about stealing . Hell , we 're lakes district , half the homes in town are closed up all winter . But you did n't worry about break-ins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From fifty to fifty-nine we had exactly one homicide . And that was Willie Becker and his wife both drunk as Chinamen slugging it out in the living room , him nailing her with an uppercut he probably never knew he had in him . " Ten years , fifteen years ago a cop 's job in a town like Sparta was mostly helping people , not chasing after punks and bad guys . You made sure the kids got to school all right mornings and stayed there and that the drunks got home to their wives at night . You cleaned up after traffic accidents , fender-benders mostly for god sakes and stood in the street directing traffic during Kiwanis Karnival or heavy weather . You worked with the volunteer fire department and the first-aid department . Sure , there was the occasional assault and battery , the occasional store theft , the occasional vandalism . But , Charlie , we were helping cats out of gutters . See what I mean ? I did n't sign on for the reason the kids do now , to catch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good thing to do and a way to do a little good . " And then the world went and changed on me . Since Kennedy died , maybe a while before , I du n no , things seem all shot to hell . " Ed ordered another beer and Teddy poured it . Teddy was listening in what his patrons had on their minds . He was n't a particularly smart man , but you could count on him to be curious and you could count on him to be discreet . " I did n't want to be that kind of cop , Charlie . I did n't want to look at Lisa Steiner 's shot-dead body four years ago and I did n't want to look at another . Not ever . I know you 've seen some since then . That 's not for me . I 'm not sure it 's for you exactly either , you want to know the god 's honest truth . But that 's your business , old buddy , your call . Teddy 's got a good corned beef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lean . I recommend it highly . " There was a clock on the wall next to Gehrig with a plaque under it saying irish time , but no clock with the real time . Schilling stared at it without really seeing it . Teddy was Polish but he 'd bought the bar from an Irishman and never bothered to change the clock or anything else about the place . He wondered if Teddy knew what time it was in Poland . " I 've got to go talk with the mother . " " No you do n't . Why ? " " You know why . " " It was four years ago , Charlie . She stopped calling , what , two-and-a-half years ago ? Let it ride . " " It 's the least I can do . " " You already did the most you could do for chrissake . " " You do n't get it . " " Okay , I 'm a dope . Tell me what I do n't get . " " I do n't care anymore , Ed . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I used to want to nail that Pye kid real bad . I went from that to figuring he 'd slip up one of these days and I could wait . I went from that to figuring we 'd never nail him , not for anything . Not even for a parking ticket and guess what ? We did n't . I had a woman couple of nights ago over on Cedar Street , little white house next to the corner . Noise complaint , two in the morning . She 's new here and I think there 's something going on between her and the neighbors , bad blood or something . " Anyhow the uniforms go over and she 's lying on the floor unconscious , stark naked with her panties pulled over her head . She 's been raped so bad she can barely stand . A year ago , two years , it would have made me mad as hell . Now it 's like it 's the ass end of another real bad day , you know ? " " See ? Same kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later . " " No . You 're wrong . You 're telling me you quit because the job description changed , you did n't want to chase the bad guys . I 'm staying on because I do want to chase the bad guys , I always did , but jesus , I need something to shake me . " " They catch this joker ? " " Jokers . Three mean boozers from Dover . One of them 's her ex-boyfriend and the other two are his army buddies . She ID 'd them right away . And all I 'm thinking is , these guys are incredibly stupid . They should have killed her . Now how about that ? I 'm thinking if they killed her they might have got away with it . " " Shit , Charlie . That 's a hell of a thing to say . " " You get no argument from me . That 's my point . " Altman , Heinz and Earle had moved on to a loud discussion about who was the better fighter , Joe Louis or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clay . The juke was blaring out a Frankie Valle tune . It was like the sixties had never happened in Panik 's joint . They had definitely happened to Schilling . " Pye , the mother and Elise Hanlon were the last ones who really got to me . I want to touch bases with her . " " Phone her up . " " Wo n't do . " " You 're telling me you 're gon na drive all the way to Short Hills ? " " Soon as I leave here . " Ed nodded toward the scotch glass . " You better go easy , then . " " I can drive on three . " " You can drive on five . I was your partner , remember ? But I 'd just as soon you did n't . " It was two hours from Sparta to Short Hills , out of the lakes district down through rolling hills to flatlands and once he hit Route 10 he took his time . He could drive on three but two would push him over the breathalyzer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good idea to get himself pulled over down here . Not in Short Hills anyway . The town was about as prosperous as New Jersey got and despite what most out-of-staters thought that was considerable . Their police were entirely by the book and their chief an irascible old son of a bitch in Schilling 's opinion . Besides , it was getting on to dark and his night vision was n't exactly what it used to be . Number 245 Old Short Hills Road looked pretty much the same as the last time he 'd seen it maybe a year ago . Except that the big black Lincoln was n't there anymore . The husband , the lawyer , had held on to that and the word was not much else , leaving Barbara Hanlon the big white house on the corner , the three-acre plot behind it and presumably a settlement large enough to cover Elise 's medical expenses and for Barbara to go on living in the style to which she 'd become accustomed . In place of the Lincoln there was a dark blue Ferrari now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwarfed by the house . Barbara Hanlon had told him once that theirs had been a happy marriage and he 'd believed her . He guessed that too had taken a bullet in the head four years ago though nobody had been aware of it at the time . Elise had outlived her parents ' marriage by just under a year . The lawyer 'd remarried . The wife had n't . He parked behind the Ferrari , got out and took the winding walkway up the hill through the carefully tended lawn and shrubbery to the steps , wondering just why he was here now that in fact he was here and what in hell he was going to say to her . He had n't rehearsed this . During the drive his mind had been mostly a blank , focused only on the road ahead , on the process of getting there . Probably he was defending himself against something . He did n't know . Right now he felt like a toad on a four-lane expressway . Something just might roll him over . He probably should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last of his peppermint Lifesaver with his front teeth and swallowed it against whiskey breath and climbed the steps and rang the bell . She took a while coming . He almost rang again . He had time to think that maybe there was nobody home . But the living room lights were on and there was the Ferrari sitting in the driveway . He need n't have bothered with the Lifesaver . The woman who opened the door was one he almost did n't recognize . The Barbara Hanlon he knew , even in her grief , even in those awful first days and nights at the hospital , had been proud and strong and very nearly beautiful , the length of her chin almost , but not quite , spoiling her elegant patrician features . As the investigation faltered and finally died she would visit the station trying to urge them on , eyes flashing with a fury only barely restrained by her sense of dignity and sheer will . It was always clear she shopped the best stores . Her grooming dotted all the i 's and crossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady and Schilling admired her . There was nothing tough about her now . This Barbara Hanlon was a mess . She 'd gained maybe twenty pounds since he saw her last . That was very clear to Schilling because beneath the thin satin robe she was also clearly naked . The robe did n't do much in the way of obscuring the fuller breasts and belly . Her face looked puffy and her makeup smudged . The long brown hair was lank and needed brushing . Her eyes were red and he was betting it was n't tears that got them that way . She held both sides of the door frame for balance . As drunk as Schilling had ever been in his life and that was going some . She stunk of gin and cigarette smoke . She stood in the doorway polluting the Short Hills air . " Christ , " she said . " It 's you . " Even the voice had changed . Like she was living with a permanent head cold now . " I heard about Elise , Mrs. Hanlon . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come by . " She nodded . Weaved . Everything he 'd said so far sounded lame to him but he had to wonder if she even noticed . " I wanted to say I 'm sorry . " She stared at him . Empty-eyed and then not . As though some sort of light upstairs kept blinking on and off . " Hon ? Who 's that ? " The voice was a man 's and it was every bit as slurred as hers was . They 'd been having a little party here . On the eve of her daughter 's death . He appeared behind her barefoot , wearing wrinkled slacks and nothing else . He was fastening his belt . He had a bony chest and thin pale arms and he 'd needed a shave since yesterday . " Policeman , Eddie . Sparta Police . Come to see us ' bout Elise . Detective Charles Schilling . The gen'lman who investigated the case . This is Eddie . " " That 's awfully nice of you , " Eddie said . He reached out and Schilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . He felt suddenly very weary . He did n't know whether he was disgusted or sad or angry with her or exactly what he was . Maybe he was all those things at once or maybe none of them . " She died eleven thirty-five this morning . They called me . Said she passed away . " " I know , Mrs. Hanlon . I 'd asked the hospital to phone me at the station if and when , so they had a note on the chart to that effect . I guess I learned a little while after you did . " " I 'm a little drunk , y'know ? " " I figure you probably have a right to be . " She started to cry . The man behind her put a hand on her shoulder . The man looked both befuddled and sincere . " Thing is , I been a little drunk a lot these days . I never did drink much before ' cept maybe a glass of wine but now I do . With Eddie . I met Eddie ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met at the Standish House , Barb . At the bar there . " " That 's right . We met at the bar . Thing is , see , it 's not just today . You understand ? " " I understand . " " It 's good of you to come by , Officer , " Eddie said . He had both hands on her shoulders now . She was quietly sobbing . Her face was red and streaked with tears . " It 's not just ' cause Elise 's gone . I wish to hell I could tell you that it was . " " Elise 's been gone a long , long time , " Eddie said to him . " Y'know ? " There was nothing he could do here . Not for himself and not for them . He knew about drunks . When Lila and the kids had left him he 'd taken to starting the morning with a couple shots of vodka and then nipping from his flask all day and passing out at night . The usual sad and stupid story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , telling the chief he was visiting a sick brother in Florida . Which turned out to be a poor choice of places to lie about when he returned without so much as a hint of a tan . " If you need any help with this , " he said , " with the drinking I mean , give me a call . Either of you . I know a good place . I 've been there myself . Anything I can do , you call me . I 'm truly sorry about your daughter , Mrs. Hanlon . " " Me too , " she said . " Real sorry . " It should have sounded silly . It did n't . It sounded like a voice up out of a well .
