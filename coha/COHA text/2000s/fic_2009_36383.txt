Chapter Five <br> <br> " COME TO COURSE TWO-SIX-NINE . <br> " Han , following his wife 's directions , banked the Falcon around and headed toward the government district . Leia , in the copilot 's seat , had her personal comlink to her ear . <br> The Falcon ' s comm board was alive with Coruscant Security and traffic monitors warning Han to return to designated ship traffic lanes or be subject to arrest . He growled and switched the thing to silent mode . " They found him ? " <br> " They found him . He 's in an X-wing with a hole in the cockpit . " <br> " Armed ? " <br> " Fifty  --  fifty chance . It was in the Senate Building , so it 's either a fully functional security vehicle or some Senator 's unarmed memoriesof- youth vehicle . I 'm hoping for the second option . " <br> " Me , too . " <br> " Come to two-five-nine . " <br> " Nah . " Han put the Falcon into a dive . His stomach fluttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting larger  --  small- vehicle traffic at and below building-top level . Flashing down at terrifying and illegal speed , he twitched the controls right and left , nimbly dodging the much smaller civilian vehicles . <br> " Han , what do you think  --  " <br> Then he was fully among them , streams of traffic above as well as below . He pulled out of his dive two hundred meters below the average height of the buildings . <br> "  --  you 're doing ? " <br> " This way , we 're off the major sensor boards . Only vehicles with line of sight on us will complain . " <br> " I understand that . I mean , why not turn to two-five-nine ? " <br> " His course changes are just to jerk us around , to confuse us . I know where he 's going . " <br> " Where ? " <br> " The spaceport , right at the edge of the government district . He stole a starfighter ; that means he wants to make space . It 's damaged , so he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <br> " Right . " <br> " When it comes to piloting and pilots , I 'm all-knowing . " <br> Leia put an artificial sweetness into her voice . " I 'll never argue with you again . " <br> Han snorted and increased velocity . A Coruscant Security speeder following in his wake dropped back , left behind as though it were suddenly standing still . <br> Luke and Ben , in Ben 's nimble red airspeeder , received the transmission with Han 's guess about the spaceport . <br> Luke , at the controls , shook his head , not pleased . The spaceport , comparatively flat and built at a much lower altitude than the surrounding residential , business , and government zones , was not , as most supposed , actually situated at bedrock level . Below it were many levels of machinery , repair hangars , Empire-era emergency bunkers , spaceport employee facilities , and repair accesses . <br> If Han was right and Valin was headed that way , even if he was unsuccessful at stealing another spaceworthy vehicle he might escape into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find him before he detected his tracking device and destroyed it . <br> Their speeder emerged from the skytowers and was abruptly out over the flatter region surrounding the spaceport . It was mostly given over to speeder parking , though it had decorative elements , including tree-spotted grassy regions and a small artificial lake . <br> And sensor stations . Almost immediately , the speeder 's comm board began blaring with instructions for them to turn back , to stay away from restricted airspace . <br> " Tell them who we are . " Luke had to raise his voice to a shout to be heard . <br> " I bet it does n't work . Who 's on the news as a criminal suspect ? You are . " <br> " Do it anyway . " Luke put the speeder into a holding pattern , keeping close to the ring of skytowers , not approaching the port itself . The authorities might well decide to shoot down a suspicious speeder  --  piloted by a suspected criminal or not  --  heading straight toward an invaluable government and civilian transportation resource @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the war , two years earlier . <br> Ben looked up from the comm board , startled . " We 're not the only ones . " <br> " What ? " Luke scanned the airspace above the spaceport . <br> There were a lot of small vehicles there now , most of them airspeeders of one size or another . Some were bigger business vehicles , many with lettering and symbols on the sides . <br> From the utility compartment , Ben pulled out a pair of macro - binoculars and held them to his eyes . " That one 's a press vehicle . Turret-mounted holocam on top . That one  --  hey , that 's Jaina . The big green one  --  oh , kriff . " <br> " Language . What is it ? " <br> " It has an oversized driver 's cab and that Skakoan is in it . " <br> Luke frowned . Suddenly everyone knew that Valin was coming here , including press and bounty hunters . That meant open comm channels were being monitored , and people with no business being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be doing this . <br> Then he saw it , almost at ground level , an X-wing painted in classic First Galactic Civil War grays . Its running lights were off ; it was illuminated only by the glows from parking area pole lights  --  it flew beneath the altitude of the lights themselves . <br> " Hold on . " Luke pushed his control yoke forward , sending the speeder into a precipitous dive . <br> Ben 's lips were drawn back in a grimace  --  perhaps because no teenager wants anyone else to endanger his vehicle recklessly , that being the teenager 's own prerogative  --  but said , " Falcon ' s incoming . " <br> " Good . " Luke put the speeder on an intercept course , or a collision course if anything went wrong , and switched the autopilot on . He unlatched his seat restraints and slid toward Ben . " Take the controls . " <br> He was gratified to see his son 's eyes open wide , but Ben did as he was told ; the boy unbuckled , slid under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <br> Luke stood up in the seat , drawing on the Force to keep him pinned in place despite the rush of wind threatening to tear him free . <br> He counted on Ben to know what to do , and his son did not let him down . Ben leveled off at the same altitude as the X-wing , completing his maneuver just meters behind the starfighter , and drew alongside that vehicle 's port side . <br> Luke sprang across the gap separating his seat from the cockpit . The wind threatened to whip him away , but a boost of Force energy carried him to the fuselage just as Valin Horn was realizing he had a pace vehicle . Luke landed astride the nose , facing astern , staring straight down into Valin 's startled features . <br> Valin yanked up on the X-wing 's armrests . The canopy was suddenly open , snapping backward , and gone , and Valin hurtled into the sky , his pilot 's chair propelled by a crude one-use rocket . <br> " Stang ! He punched out . " Han @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Han felt . " Can the cargo tractor beam  --  " <br> " Not strong enough . Ca n't compensate for a fast-moving target . " <br> " We have to go after Valin , then . " <br> Han shook his head . " The ejection wo n't have left enough controls for Luke to land the X-wing . He may be able to lift it or push it down with the Force . . . but land it with no controls ? No . We have to help him . " He heeled over , diving toward the X-wing . <br> " He punched out . " Jaina reluctantly turned her attention from Luke , disappearing toward the spaceport on the uncontrolled X-wing , and returned it to Valin , still ascending in his ejection seat . She banked and headed toward the rogue Jedi . <br> In the passenger seat , Master Kyle Katarn , about Luke 's age , darkhaired and dark-bearded , stretched as if coming out of a nap . " You plan to maneuver underneath and catch him ? " <br> " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large , flatbed cargo hauler with figures standing in the cargo bed . This vehicle rose toward Valin 's position from a much nearer position . " So do they . " <br> Valin 's seat reached its maximum altitude and began dropping . Immediately the short-term repulsor within the seat activated , slowing his descent . He felt as though he 'd taken a tremendous blow to the top of his head , doing no damage to it but compressing the spine beneath . Ejections were always like that  --  bad , but better than the alternative . <br> And he 'd always relish the look on Not-Luke 's face when he 'd ejected . It had been priceless . <br> A cargo hauler maneuvered itself toward his descent path . Grumbling , he got his lightsaber into one hand , grabbing his seat restraint buckle with the other . <br> As the hauler came underneath , instead of waiting for the seat to touch down , Valin unbuckled the restraints and flipped forward , landing on his feet moments before the seat landed . <br> In the cargo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vastly oversized weapon , a shining droid whose construction bore a slight resemblance to a human skeleton , and a tall blond woman whose black bantha-hide jacket was decorated with a vast number of claws and teeth in different sizes and colors , sewn in place ; she carried a Wookiee bowcaster . <br> Valin smiled at them , but not in a friendly way . " Two maladjusted want-to-be bounty hunters and their dressed-up protocol droid . " <br> " Surrender , " the Quarren said . " It will hurt less . " He raised his preposterous weapon to his shoulder . <br> " Jump into a fire . " Valin all but ignored the two organic beings . He kept his attention on the droid  --  a YVH 1 combat droid , one of the most dangerous machines to be found anywhere . <br> Now even machines were giving him a bad feeling . And he could detect a life-form heading toward him from straight above  --  <br> He glanced upward to see a speeder car passing by overhead , and boot heels , flapping Jedi robes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling rate . <br> In his lower peripheral vision , he saw the three bounty hunters glance up to spot the descending Jedi . Valin took the opportunity to act : he grabbed his abandoned ejection seat and leapt with it off the rear end of the cargo hauler . <br> Jaina landed in a crouch just where Valin had been standing . He was gone . She rose to glower at the bounty hunters . " Do n't bother . " <br> " We 're not here to harm you , " the YVH droid said , its tones utterly and confidently human . <br> Jaina stared at the thing , nonplussed . " Just what have you been programmed for ? " <br> She felt a tickle in the Force , warning of imminent attack , and saw the Quarren 's finger tighten on the trigger . She jumped to one side as he fired . <br> It did her no good . The missile that emerged from the weapon immediately flared out into a haze that wrapped around her , clinging everywhere  --  it took her a fraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trailing some sort of cylindrical package . <br> Then the first jolt of electrical pain hit her . Startled , suddenly separated from her Force powers , she sailed over the edge of the cargo hauler and dropped into empty space beyond . <br> Valin clung to the ejection seat and rode it down another twenty meters . The next vehicle to approach him held no ersatz Jedi , no imposters that he could see  --  it was a boxy blue speeder , the Galaxy 9 News logo painted on its side in yellow . It drew alongside , its pilot skillfully keeping pace with Valin 's rate of descent . <br> A dark-skinned woman leaned out the passenger-side window . " Jedi Horn ! Is it true you 're on a destructive rampage ? " <br> Valin leapt from his seat , slamming into the side of the speeder , holding on to the woman 's door to keep from falling . She drew back , startled , but he gave her a friendly smile . " Get me out of here , away from these people , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <br> The woman 's eyes widened . She turned to issue a brief command to her pilot , then turned back , all smiles . " Let me help you in . . . " <br> " I 'll hang on here , thanks . " The news speeder banked , sluggish , and headed toward the business district . " How did you know I was Valin Horn ? " <br> " An arrest bulletin issued a little while ago by the office of the Chief of State . . . " <br> The Quarren watched , startled , as Jaina Solo vanished over the lip . <br> The woman in the black jacket clapped him on the back . " Nice move , fish-head . She 's not  --  " <br> Her words were cut off as an airspeeder , painted in a stylish silvergray , dived past the cargo hauler 's cab , missing it by less than a meter . <br> The hauler 's pilot reacted instinctively , veering to starboard and down . The sudden maneuver sharply tilted the cargo bed . <br> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of the cargo hauler . The blond woman staggered , too , but dropped , rolled with an acrobat 's skill , and fetched up safely against the low rail at the side of the cargo bed . <br> The YVH droid did n't budge . <br> Luke flipped into the cockpit and did an involuntary dance for a moment until both feet found nonsuperheated areas on the floor of the still-smoking compartment . <br> He glanced at the controls and grimaced . Every screen was out of commission . Experimentally , he waggled the yoke and found it unresponsive . This would be tricky , if not downright impossible . <br> Unless  --  <br> He turned . There , in the circular slot behind the cockpit , rested a gray and red R2 astromech . <br> " Hey , there . Can you pilot this thing ? " <br> The R2 tweetled , ending on a sorrowful note . <br> " Forget steering . Can you kill the thrusters but leave the repulsors running ? " <br> The R2 offered a series of notes that sounded quizzical . Luke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that lasted a fraction of a second each , then the R2 tweetled an affirmative . <br> " Do so . Execute . Problem solved . " Luke turned to port . Ben was still there , a few meters away , pacing him with considerable skill . <br> Luke leapt back across , settling into the passenger seat . " Did you keep track of Valin ? " <br> " Up thirty degrees , port twenty , three hundred meters . " <br> " Strap in and take us there . " Leia shook her head as she watched Luke abandon the X-wing . " I 'm not sure how , but he thinks he has it solved . " <br> " Probably drafted the astromech . Took me a second to think of that myself . " Han did not look away from the silver-gray speeder , which had , moments earlier , matched the netted Jaina 's precipitous fall ; then the pilot had gestured , drawing Jaina into the seat beside him with an exertion through the Force , and pulled out of his dive . Han @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't seen any of it . <br> He shook his head . Jaina must not even have been alarmed , since Leia had not even detected her brief emergency . He put the Falcon into a tight curve , aiming it toward the news speeder that now bore Valin away and the lumbering cargo hauler chasing it . " That YVH droid could be bad news . Want to take the belly lasers ? " <br> " I do . " Leia was unstrapped and up in an instant , headed aft toward the laser turret access shaft . <br> Jaina , helpless , spasmed again as another electrical shock coursed through her . " Get this thing off me . " <br> " I 'm driving here , and that 's Get this thing off me , please , Master Katarn . " <br> She offered a very Han Solo  --  ish growl in response . <br> Dropping almost to parked-speeder level , Kyle set his vessel in pursuit of Valin 's conveyance and the cargo hauler . The hauler now seemed to be towing something at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize the Quarren . A cable stretched between his weapon and the tail of the hauler , and the Quarren held on to his weapon with both arms as if to save his life . As the hauler picked up speed , the Quarren was towed along behind at a more shallow angle . <br> Absently , barely looking , Kyle took his lightsaber from his belt , lit it , and lashed out against the metal cylinder attached to Jaina 's net where it lay bouncing on the back of the speeder . His blow sheared through the object without scarring the speeder 's paint beneath . " Better ? " <br> " Actually , yes . " Jaina lay there a few more moments , then began struggling with the net . It had relaxed , no longer constricting or clinging to itself , and she was able to unwrap it within moments . " Electrical shocks . " <br> " Interfering with your control over the Force . Which turns you from a Jedi into a rather weak gymnast with a spasming problem . " <br> " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 News speeder reached the edge of the business district before any of the vehicles pursuing it caught up . It shot through the cleft between skytowers that constituted the end of the spaceport zone and dropped toward lower traffic lanes . <br> The bounty hunter cargo hauler followed , descending at an angle not recommended for such a big , ungainly vehicle , still trailing the Quarren , who looked increasingly frantic . Then came Jaina and Kyle in their speeder , the Falcon , Luke and Ben , and finally a stream of speeders with Jedi , spaceport security , press , and more bounty hunters intermixed . <br> " Whoa . " Kyle put the speeder into a side-to-side evasive maneuver an instant before the YVH droid in the cargo hauler opened fire . Streams of blasterfire flashed beside his door , then just above Jaina 's head , then immediately under the fuselage . <br> A pulse of laserfire , four brilliant red streams converging so closely that they seemed to be one , crossed from above and behind the speeder to hit the YVH droid dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its feet and smashed through the rear of the hauler 's control cab , disappearing completely . <br> Smoke poured out of the cab , and the hauler began to nose forward into a shallow dive . <br> Jaina craned her neck back to see the Falcon , pacing the speeder at a higher altitude . She waved at her mother , clearly visible in the underside turret . " Thanks , Mom . " <br> " Most mothers just pack a lunch . " Kyle put on a burst of speed , accelerating toward the news speeder . " You want to try another jump ? " <br> " I guess . " Jaina checked her lightsaber , then clipped it to her belt . <br> Another speeder , black with arrow-tipped white stripes on the sides , open-topped , raced past Kyle 's . It was no civilian vehicle ; the roar from its engines was similar to that of a Podracer . It was a twoseater , and the pilot was the bounty hunter who dressed as a Jedi . Beside her was a man Jaina had barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusually long blaster rifle , scoped , in his hands . As they roared past , the woman gave Kyle and Jaina a wave . <br> The striped racer dipped low and passed the news speeder moments later . Jaina saw the passenger turn , raise his weapon , and fire at the news vehicle . <br> It was not a destructive shot  --  it was surgical . Smoke began issuing from the news speeder . It wobbled , probably from a fright reflex on the part of the pilot . Moments later , viewports all over the vehicle opened , allowing smoke to pour out everywhere . <br> * * * Luke took a moment to assess the vista before him . The news speeder was clearly doomed , so Valin would be abandoning it as soon as possible . " Take me over it , just to one side . " <br> Ben nodded and put on more speed . Crowding the edge of the traffic lane , he passed below the Falcon , then above Master Katarn and Jaina . Drawing near the news speeder , he maintained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly above the speeder 's roof . <br> Once again Luke looked down into the face of Valin Horn . He flipped over the side and landed at the rear of the speeder 's roof , stabilizing himself through the Force . <br> Valin flipped up to the roof . " Wish you 'd taken longer with that X-wing . " <br> Luke gestured at the lightsaber Valin carried  --  not Valin 's own , it was a very simple cylinder of shining steel . " Did that belong to your nurse ? " <br> " Yes . " Valin switched it on . " It 's not very stylish , but  --  " <br> " That 's enough . " Luke advanced , activating his own lightsaber . Valin raised his in a preliminary block . Luke struck , twitching his blade out of the most obvious line of attack , and the blade sheared the hilt of Valin 's weapon in two , not harming him . <br> Valin 's blade switched off as the weapon 's lower half dropped into the darkened urban chasm below . Valin took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before dropping off the front of the speeder , but Luke 's advance was near instantaneous . The Grand Master slammed the butt of his own weapon into Valin 's temple . <br> Valin Horn dropped like a slaughterhouse bantha . Luke caught his topcoat lapel , keeping him from following the lightsaber wreckage into the depths . <br> Continues ...
