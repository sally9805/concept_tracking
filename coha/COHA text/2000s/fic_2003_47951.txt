Andrew Byar began his experiment in the garden , going out in the dusky evenings after the help had dispersed for the day , after the cook had served the last meal and washed the china and departed to catch the final trolley , after the gardener had arranged the tools in a gleaming , orderly progression against the shed walls , had carried the remnants of the weeding to the mulch pile at the edge of the grounds , and had tended to the orchids hung like lanterns from the trellis-that was when Andrew Byar went outside , the house behind him lit like a great ship , his wife and grown sons moving through their evening rituals beyond the panes of glass . <p> It was June , the air fragrant with jasmine , honeysuckle , and mimosa . Catalpa blossoms burst like stars in the trees ; their delicate custard scent infused the violet air . Andrew walked to the shed , stepping quickly , almost stealthily along the path , as if he were a thief and not the owner of these three verdant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bluff overlooking the flatlands on the opposite shore of the Monongahela River . There , his steel plants roared all day and night , bright as beating hearts , glinting in the distance like piles of burnished coins . <p> At the shed door he turned on the flashlight and stepped into darkness rich with the scent of raw wood and linseed oil and fresh , damp earth . He made his way to the workbench . Beneath it , shoved in a corner , was a wooden crate once used to ship fresh persimmons from the sea coasts of Japan , now buried under blankets . Dust billowed in Byar 's narrow beam of light , and the smells of mildew and oil flew up as he dragged the crate to the middle of the room . He slid the lid off and groped inside for the strongbox hidden beneath a pile of old magazines , limp and yellowed . The box , smooth steel , was wrapped carefully in layers of oily rags , which fell in a soft pile by the polished leather of his shoes . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took from the inner pocket of his coat . <p> A ten-ounce bottle , fashioned of brown glass , was cushioned in a cloud of cotton . Ubiquitous , it might have held iodine , or smelling salts . Andrew Byar balanced his flashlight on the bench . He took a test tube from his pocket and carefully poured a clear liquid from the bottle , filling the vial to a line marked near the top , then stoppering it with a cork . He put the brown glass bottle back into the box , nestled the box into the rags and beneath the wilting magazines , and slid the crate back to its position beneath the bench , the moldy blankets . Flashlight in one hand and the test tube in another , he went back outside , striding past the swimming pool and down the gravel path between the camellia bushes laden with rosy white flowers , until he came to the trellis where the orchids hung . <p> Here , he paused . From this clearing the house was visible only in pieces through the trees , magnificent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare remnants of the virgin forests felled a century before to build the city . He stood watching for a moment , glimpsing the glassy light and shadowed brick amid the leaves , imagining his wife in her evening bath , plush towels on the floor of Italian marble and rose petals scattered on the water . Recently , her hair had begun to gray , and each week a stylist came to the house and left her gilded , as pale and ornately framed as a mirror . Still , in her expressions , her slowing movements , Andrew Byar faced his own age . His two sons were home from college for the summer , apprenticed to the steel factory , which he had built from nothing and through which he had made his fortune . They were indolent young men , handsome and spoiled , and he had no confidence in them . This summer they had brought friends , steady rivers of young men and women whose bright laughter flowed through the house , who studded the tennis courts with their flashing limbs and shouts , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swam laps in the natural spring pool or splashed in the shallows or drank martinis at its edge . Andrew avoided them and slept poorly , waking from nightmares where his empire , built at such sacrifice and with such canny skill , constructed so painstakingly from the hours and sweat of his whole life , had been frittered into nothing as they played . <p> The test tube in his hand had warmed until it seemed to give off its own heat . Andrew held it up , trying to discern if a faint glow came from within , or if this was merely a trick of the scarce evening light . The single brown bottle hidden in his shed had cost more than his pool , more even than the private train carriage fitted out with velvet and gold in which he traveled to New York City once a month . Yet if this liquid was , as he believed , an elixir of life , then no expense was too much , no cost beyond consideration , even if it cost him the earth . <p> He took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drop by drop , he poured the liquid evenly into the soil around the orchid . <p> He stood still before the trellis then , until the darkness was complete , until the crickets and frogs filled his head with a frenzied singing that seemed near madness . Then he slipped the empty tube into his pocket and went home . <p> In this way his evenings passed for one month , then another . By day he was , as usual , consumed by business . He drew up contracts in his office or strode along the catwalks over the burning furnaces , while below men worked , shadows shoveling and hefting and shaping long bars of steel . The heat from the red-hot metal pleased him , as did the intricate dance between machinery and men , and he looked forward , too , to the end of every week when the accountant brought the production figures to his office high above the plant , sliding them across the mahogany desk in a black leather folder edged with gold leaf . Andrew Byar , born poor in Scotland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He believed in the power of his own personal will , and he believed in science . Pittsburgh in the 1920 's was a pulsing city , powered by great machines and fabulous inventions , and if soot sometimes fell from the air like dark snow , if the rivers grew choked and black , then Andrew Byar believed that science would find solutions . Already electricity had displaced the dangerous hiss of gas , the awkward churning of steam ; in decades to come the city would gleam , a bright metropolis , sunlight scattering and refracting from the mirrored surfaces of a million well-oiled moving parts . <p> All made , of course , from steel . <p> Byar had profited from his keen understanding of new technologies , as well as from his instincts for risk and innovation . He trusted people less completely , knowing as he did about human frailty and failure-how many men had died in his plant through a single careless action , after all ? How many times had a widow appeared in his office , begging for money to feed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care to explain each time how the accident might have been avoided . Thus wise in matters of human failure and culpability , he had given his gardener a camera with instructions to photograph the orchid in the garden every morning at precisely eight o'clock . Memory , with its unexpected currents , its tendency to favor hope over facts , was not something he would trust . Each day the gardener came into his study and put a manila envelope on his desk , and each day Andrew Byar dated this envelope and filed it in the oak drawer of his desk without opening it up . <p> At the end of the second month , when his family was in Europe , he locked the door to his study and took the sixty-one sealed envelopes from the drawer . Clear morning light poured through the windows which ran floor to ceiling along the wall behind him . He hung the photos one by one , in chronological order , against the opposite wall , securing each to the plaster with a bit of tape . By the time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was methodical , careful , precise . Not until the final photo was hung did he step back to survey the whole . <p> What he saw astounded him . He had begun with an orchid whose flowers were sparse , a plant well past its prime . Yet , nourished by this experimental liquid , the plant had flourished so profusely that change was clearly visible from one photo to another . After only a single week the orchid had burst its pot ; twice more in these two months it had done the same , and now it was as large as a bush . Blooms cascaded from stems grown so long that they draped themselves over one another , trailed against the ground . He went immediately to the garden , where the orchid hung from the center of the trellis , its blossoms living jewels . He touched their waxy white petals , their deep purple hearts , with awe . What had been ordinary had become something from another world , a place more fertile and profuse , a place of unending plenty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agitation , distracted in his morning meetings , pacing the factory grounds and glancing at his watch , willing the slow hours to pass . At last , evening began to gather , and he went home . He dismissed all the help and sent his car for Beatrice . Wear white , he instructed in a note , folding the dense paper once , imagining her at her dressing table , the dark words discarded amid her bottles of perfume . She would be late , he knew . Spirited and capricious , she would take her time ; perhaps she would not come at all . He had seen her first one morning at dawn , an errant , early-rising guest floating like a petal on the invisible and mysterious currents of the pool , her pale skin almost iridescent . <p> Dusk was softening the edges of the world . Impatient , unused to idleness , he arranged the setting carefully to pass the time , carrying a white wrought-iron table and chairs to the expanse of soft lawn . It was a night garden , bordered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked , releasing their faint scents of lemon into the darkness . He hung the spectacular orchid from a low branch of a sycamore tree , each blossom like a candle in a chandelier . In a crystal bowl filled with water he placed white lilacs and camellia blossoms , so that the table seemed a part of the garden and yet appeared to float above it , too , to be suspended , hovering as bright and fleeting as a wish . <p> At last he heard her footsteps , rustling the gravel . And then he glimpsed her on the path , as pale and slender as the stem of plant . Her white dress had a diaphanous layer , making her both vibrant and undefined , amorphous . She wore a fitted hat , close as a caress against her skull . <p> " What is it ? " she asked , laughing , her lips cool against his own . " I ca n't wait to know . What is your surprise ? " <p> They sat at the table . Andrew Byar pulled an unlabeled bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass smooth and undulant in his hands . <p> " This wine , " he said , " is two centuries years old . A case of it was discovered on the bottom of the sea , part of a shipwreck off the coast of France in 1718 . For all those decades it lay beneath the waters , and when they brought it up it was still intact . Think of it , Beatrice-the grapes which made this wine grew in the world when the garden where we sit was nothing but wilderness . " <p> Beatrice smiled , intrigued , he could tell , and curious . It was the same look she had given him when she climbed out of the pool at sunrise , her skin so pale against her lavender suit , water streaming from her limbs , and found him standing there , watching her and waiting . <p> The cork crumbled ; he poured the wine and raised his glass to hers . <p> " To the lost past , " he toasted . " And to our future . " <p> The rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not bitter , with a trace of cherry . Marvelous , Beatrice murmured . When their glasses were empty , Andrew reached into the canvas bag and pulled out another bottle , which he put on the table beside the first . <p> " This one has a label , " Beatrice observed . <p> Andrew smiled . The night air was as warm as breath . " Yes , " he said . " It 's the most recent vintage from the same vineyard in France where the first wine was made . " He turned the modern bottle , keeping his eyes on her face . " Of course , in another two hundred years , when this bottle is opened , almost everything that is living now will be dead . " <p> " You puzzle me , " she said , and looked away , and he remembered that despite her youth she was sensitive to death ; she had lost her only brother to influenza . <p> " Yes , " he said , " it is most depressing , I agree . But Beatrice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He put the bottle down and took her hands . " What if , in two hundred years , we could sit in this garden again , just as we are now , and open this bottle together ? " <p> She laughed , and her laughter struck his silence like waves and fell away . <p> " I do n't understand you , " she said . <p> He stood then , and pulled her up . He showed her the orchid which had been so withered , now profuse with life . The year was 1922 , and the Curies had transformed plain earth into something rare and unimagined . A secret of the universe had been revealed , and a restless world dreamed of transformation . In drugstores everywhere were special toothpastes , hand creams , bath salts , liniments , chocolates , all laced with radium , promising miracles . In factories across the country , women painted luminous faces onto clocks , licking the tips of their brushes to keep a fine point , tasting a bitter metal from the heart of the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could afford to have a little radium , but only a man as rich as Andrew Byar could have all he wanted . Radi Os . He whispered the name of his elixir , running his fingertips over the vial in his pocket . When he told Beatrice what the bottle had cost , she gasped . And when he poured the drops into her second glass of wine and his , this wine from grapes vanished for two hundred summers , she drank . <p> Paradise lost , he thought leaning back in his chair . Pale flowers opened in the darkness , amid the rising sounds of insects , and the wine warmed his throat , hers . <p> Paradise lost , now found . <p> Andrew had called the car , it was waiting when Beatrice finally left the house , sitting quietly as a shadow by the gate . She walked , listening to the night sounds of crickets and wind in the leaves , and the harsh crunch of the stones beneath her pale satin shoes . Her eyes would not stay down , she looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scattering stars . Her father had a telescope and had tried to teach her the constellations , taking her to the roof of their own great house and pointing out , with infinite patience , the belts and flames and streaming hair , the cups of stars brimming over with night-darkened sky . She had studied it to please him , but she could never see what he was so intent on showing her . Celestial navigation , he explained , a science of the air : whole fleets had traveled with only these stars for guides . Beatrice stared until her eyes ached and stars burned phosphorescent against her closed lids , but even then the patterns eluded her . Often , just as she felt on the verge of seeing the stars coalesce into a shape , they seemed to swell , spilling over into rivers , shattering like a handful of rice strewn across blacktop . Her father sighed and put the telescope away . He could not imagine that his only living child would not share his love and aptitude for science . <p> The driver had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright arc as he reached to start the engine . Beatrice paused to tell him she would walk-the night air was so lovely-then passed through the gate into the street . Her footsteps were solid and lonely on the city sidewalks . The vast grounds of the estate rose wild and tangled beside her ; a soft breeze stirred the diaphanous wrap she wore across her shoulders . The night was so dark that the random stars seemed nearly within her reach . Beatrice flung her head back to gaze at them , joy cascading through her flesh . She felt like a star herself , pale and radiant , as if every one of her cells were burning bright , as if she gave off her own particular light into the universe . <p> This feeling was something new : perhaps , though not certainly , it was the consequence of Andrew 's elixir . When he put the drops into her wine , she had stopped laughing out of respect , though privately she had remained amused . She had drunk out of curiosity and politeness , repeating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vessel , but also being true to a vow she had made to herself . For Beatrice was involved in an experiment of her own , one that had only tangentially to do with Andrew Byar . The wine had tasted old , of worn oak with a trace of mold . She let it linger on her tongue , imagining those vanished grapes , but she had tasted nothing out of the ordinary , not even the tinge of salt from all those decades beneath the sea . <p> It was not until later , after they had finished the wine and were walking along the rock path through the white garden , that it began . Moths , luna and sphinx , skimmed through the shadows and lit on the moonflowers , lifting their slow wings . Near the house , a bed of white nasturtiums seemed to flicker and spark . Beatrice slipped off her shoes and waded into the pool , a natural spring shaped by stones . You look like a water lily , Andrew said , and she glanced down at her dress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed her palm to his cheek . He caught her hand and kissed it , his lips against the shallow concave below her fingers , his breath in the palm of her hand . She felt it then for the first time , how her flesh , where it had been touched by his , seemed to pulse with light , transformed , but she blamed this sensation on the wine , the starry light , the strangeness of the moonstruck garden . They walked across the grass . She stumbled , and he caught her arm , and she felt it again : the splay of his fingers like rays of sun on her skin . Inside the house , it was no different . Light trailed from his fingertips and marked her flesh , light soared through her like a comet in his bed . <p> Now she turned onto the avenue of stately homes , the white wrap slipping from her shoulders , her hair falling loose down her back . It was an extraordinary night , the air soft and warm , a caress . She heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she passed through the familiar gates of her father 's estate , less grand than Byar 's but magnificent all the same , she turned and waved to the driver , who looked straight ahead at the empty road and pretended not to see her . Then , still smiling , she followed the tree-lined path to the back garden , where she sat on a bench by the pond . On the rooftop her father 's telescopes stood in a line , and beyond them , the stars . <p> Beatrice was twenty years old and beautiful , and she had made herself this promise : she would never be used , she would always be free . She would follow her heart wherever it might take her , and in this way she would discover her own true understanding of the world . It was an experiment as daring as Andrew 's , as full of uncertain hope , though to those who knew her she was merely wild , spoiled , a girl whose family had never recovered from the death of her older brother , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to die of influenza eight months later in the room where he 'd been born . Three years ago , this was . Beatrice had been seventeen , and when the doctor emerged from her brother 's room to break the news , she had felt her world splinter , like glass cracked and held only tenuously in its former shape . Her mother had collapsed , weeping , and her father had bent his graying head , revealing a vulnerable place at the back of his neck , reddened by his collar . Beatrice , however , had not moved . She had not dared . What had been held together , logical and orderly , was suddenly unbound . Her brother , whom she had loved , who had taught her to ride a horse and sneak to the train tracks to flatten pennies when the engines roared past , this brother with his pale hair and paler blue eyes , was suddenly , mysteriously gone from the world . Why ? she demanded , turning her fierce anger on the friends and relatives and clergy who came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they shook their heads and could offer no answer more complete than the natural order of the world , a pattern fixed in place , preordained , divine . <p> Beatrice had been a dutiful girl , receiving the world and the rules of her society as true and inevitable , just as one accepted the moon rising or the servant girl bringing clean clothes into her room at dawn . However , she could not accept this . Walking the paths of the estate at all hours of the day and night , remembering her brother 's laughter and the touch of his hand and the way sunlight made his pale hair look white , she began to question everything . <p> She began to push the limits of her world , too , tentatively at first , then more urgently . She was steadfast against the hue and cry which resulted , utterly determined to step beyond the strictures she had known . But she was not cynical . More than ever , the world seemed full of mysteries she could hardly comprehend , and the visible fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glimpsed at unexpected moments-a white curtain rising from an open window , or leaf shadows playing on the tiled floor of her room-images that layered and gathered , inexplicable but powerful . Yet her intuitions could no longer be contained by the structures she had accepted all her life , and this discovery made her feel breathless , as if she stood on the edge of an abyss , even while the world around her went on much as it always had , knit back together by the ordinary day-to-day . Do n't you see , she wanted to shout , at her father bent over endless figures of steel sales and her mother arranging flowers and the cook cutting a hundred biscuits out for tea . Do n't you see that everything has changed ? <p> Had they looked up , she would have explained that the rules were like a net : they could not hold the fleeting thing they sought to capture . But no one did look up , and Beatrice slowly understood that she must discover the truth of the world on her own . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embrace every experience ; she would discard all preconceptions ; she would see every moment as an open door , and she would step through each one wide-eyed , without fear . <p> Thus , when she emerged from the pool , water glistening cool on her pale limbs , and saw Andrew Byar watching her , transfixed , she had smiled . <p> And thus on this night , when the leaves stirred behind the hydrangea bushes by her father 's house and a figure emerged , tall , dressed in black , invisible except for his hands and face shining out to her like beacons , she smiled once more . <p> " I thought you were never coming , " she said , tranquil . <p> " I waited here for hours , " the young man complained , sitting down beside her , taking her hand . Light shot through her ; she thought of Andrew Byar and his garden . <p> " Poor Roberta , " she said . <p> He was a distant relative of her mother 's , come from Italy for the summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was seeking someone suitable to take over the business when he died . He had never considered asking Beatrice to do so , something which had not troubled her until she perceived that the rules of the world were light and hollow , easily knocked aside . Idly , she wondered if her father 's decision might change if he knew that she was going to live forever , and she laughed . <p> " It is not funny , " Roberto said , speaking in a formal , lilting English that she loved . " All day I have been dreaming of this time with you , and then you do not come . It is insulting . " <p> " I 'm sorry , " she said , and she was , though she was not regretful . " I was called away unexpectedly . There was no way to inform you . " <p> " Called away to where ? " <p> " It 's not discussible , " she said lightly . " It is my own affair entirely . " <p> He did not answer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The old Beatrice would have hastened to soothe away his anger , but now she sat quietly , waiting with interest to see what would happen next . <p> " I am in love with you , " he said , angry at having been forced into this admission , or perhaps at the feeling itself . " I do n't want to lose even a moment of our time . " <p> She put her hand to his cheek , as she had earlier with Andrew . Offended still , Roberto turned his face away . Beatrice let her hand fall to her lap , wondering for the first time if what Andrew had claimed might be true . She had not really considered it , what it might mean to be ageless , to live outside of time . To explore every facet of the world , to follow every passion to its depths , because she would not have to choose one over another . <p> " What do you think ? " she asked Roberto . " Would you like to live forever ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once . " Each moment you are gone is an eternity to me . " <p> Beatrice laughed then , delighted by the way all doors opened to new places . Impulsively she kissed Roberto , sliding her hand behind his neck and her tongue into his mouth , where it bloomed like a flower struck by light . <p> Summer grew rich and dense , and then , subtly , it began to wane . A few leaves drifted to the ground , and overnight the dogwoods turned flame red . In his garden the orchid still flowered profuse and opulent , and elsewhere , in his car , Andrew Byar splayed his long , hard fingers on the custom-built walnut desk . The city was a rush of lights beyond his open windows , and from a distance came the roar from the steel plants , humming night and day . Recently , he had ordered a new furnace , determined to best his competitors , richer and more famous than he . They were old men now , men whose time of building and creating would soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> For two months and five days he and Beatrice had been drinking the Radi Os . It had become a ritual , and as with any ritual there were rules , intricate ceremonies which had taken on their own life , and which must not be broken . Each week they met in the garden , even though his family had returned and sometimes moved , visible , beyond the panes of glass . The alyssum had grown brittle , and the moonflowers had wilted , and the magnificent orchid would soon be moved into the greenhouse in anticipation of an early frost . Capricious still , as beautiful and willful as ever , Beatrice nonetheless joined him at the table each week , watching seriously and silently as he placed the drops into her glass . Any wine would do by now , any sort of dress , but they each assumed the same position at the table as they had on that first night , and they knew without speaking that they must finish their drinks in a single swallow . Dusk , it must be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside afterwards and sometimes Beatrice merely rose and disappeared into the shadows . The eager talk of their early days , the chattering comparisons of change-flesh that quickened , fingertips that trembled-had given way to a pensive silence . They touched less and less often as the new sensations grew ; even the most casual union was almost more than they could bear . One kiss , and his lips hummed for hours . A brush of their fingertips , and his hands carried her warmth , her imprint , like a brand . <p> Like a brand . It was so . Before the experiment , Beatrice had been a flicker on the edge of his mind , a pleasure , a reward , laughter falling amid the flowers in his garden at the end of the day . It had pleased him that she was the daughter of a significant rival , that she was pliant and easy , slipping so carelessly into his bed , apparently removed from any of the strictures and concerns that governed other women . A wild child , a free spirit , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , now that they had been sealed together by this secret , now that he saw her regularly and might go on doing so for decades or even centuries to come , she never left his mind . <p> Indeed , he had become obsessed with her , with her indifference . Here , after all , was the rarest gift , and he had given it to her alone , to Beatrice . Not to his wife with her gilded hair , not to his indolent sons , not to anyone else but Beatrice . She had been surprised and pleased and curious ; it was true that she came faithfully each week to meet him . Yet not once had she expressed joy or wonder at having been so chosen , and lately this had begun to trouble Andrew Byar . He had given her this gift : why , then , should she still withhold her heart ? Yet Beatrice remained as she had always been , amused and curious , but strangely distant , as if her own life were a book she was reading , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gaze out the window at the sky . <p> Andrew 's expectations had been so fully disappointed that he found himself regretful of the future . What if , in the uncountable days that lay before them , he became completely disillusioned with her ? What if his companion turned out to be a woman he despised ? The orchid thrived , cascading gem-like blossoms ; released from the prospect of death , however , Andrew Byar 's feelings for Beatrice were withering into dust . He saw her now in the harshest light , and became critical of the tiniest habits of her being : the way a muscle flickered her cheeks when she stifled a yawn or a smile , the irritating motion of her throat as she drank , her persistence in murmuring the foolish slang of the day whenever she was moved or delighted by the world . <p> In a decade , he wondered , in a century , would her quirks move him to violence ? A life sentence , he mused : the phrase had taken on new meaning . <p> Yet at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . More and more often he dispatched his driver to seek her out , and more and more often she was not to be found . Her aloofness made him brood , it made him angry . He would cut her off , he thought sometimes , awash in anger , sitting alone in his great office , trembling with this unfamiliar inability to accomplish what he wished . Science had been Andrew Byar 's life , yet science had not prepared him for this . Not for the rage he felt upon learning she met others , in the garden of her father 's estate or on the rooftop or in the cars of trains . Not for the longing and misery which welled up to replace the rage , a depthless yearning which was what had driven him , finally , out in his car to confront her on this night . <p> He pulled into the circular drive before her father 's house . A maid , fluttering and startled when he asked for Beatrice , explained that she was in the roof garden . Andrew brushed away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strode across the foyer , following his instincts up the wide , curved staircase to the second floor and the steeper one to the third , where he discovered the open door and the ladder that went to the roof . He climbed , emerging into the crisp night air . Urns of flowers and small trees had transformed the rooftop into a park . Benches and tables offered places to rest and view the glittering cityscape below . Beatrice stood with her head bent over a telescope , her hair cascading over her shoulders , as the silhouetted figure beside her pointed out the belt of Orion , the Big Dipper and the Little , the flowing tresses of the Coma Berenice . " Surely you can see them , " he exclaimed . He was wearing a hat , and he gestured at the stars with a folded newspaper . " Why , they are as clear as if I had drawn them there myself . " <p> " Let me look again , " she soothed . Dark hair slipped across her cheek , and in that instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could never deny Beatrice , any more than he could deny himself . What had begun as science and desire had become something more , something as essential to him as life itself , so that seeing her in this intimacy with a stranger , involved in a world of which he knew nothing , made him catch his breath in pain . <p> At this the two looked up , startled , from their telescopes . <p> " Andrew ! " Beatrice exclaimed . Her father-for it was her father , Jonathan Crane , with his shock of white hair falling over his eyes and an old man 's spotted hands-took a single step and said , " Byar , what the devil are you doing here ? " <p> " I came to talk to Beatrice . " <p> " Uninvited , " Beatrice said sharply . <p> Jonathan Crane looked swiftly from one to another , his spare white beard cutting the air . <p> " Well , " he said . " Beatrice is right here , as you see . Whether she will speak to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you may be of some assistance to me , Byar . Come here , and have a look . Beatrice insists that there is no order in the sky . Tell her , if you would , that she is wrong . " <p> " Perhaps not wrong , exactly , " Byar demurred , crossing the roof . Beatrice was staring at him ; he felt her gaze like the sting of a slap . " Perhaps she prefers the stars to remain unknown . " <p> " Perhaps I see my own patterns , " she replied . " Perhaps I seek new patterns altogether . " <p> " The world is as it is , " her father said . " Come , Byar , have a look . " <p> Andrew leaned over the telescope , gazing up at a familiar sky . When he finally stood , the old man was studying him with a gaze both unremitting and intent , reminding him of the many meetings at which they had faced each other just so , opposed on issues of steel production or charitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the order of the stars was clear to him , and he could not see the point in saying otherwise . " And the Big Dipper , hung from the North Star as if from a hook . " " <p> There , you see , Beatrice ? " her father said . " Even your secret lover can find the constellations . " <p> Into the shocked silence which followed , the old man spoke again . " Yes , I know , " he said . " All except for your intentions , Byar . Beatrice visits you , in secret , or so she presumes , every week . At those meetings you give her a glass of wine . Sometimes , she goes inside with you , and sometimes she does not . I am her father , and I am asking what your intentions are . " <p> Andrew Byar stared at his old rival . How had he been discovered so completely ? His next emotion , however , was pure fear . For he had understood , in that moment when he emerged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its roots in the possibility of loss . He understood , too , that if Beatrice were not present to solidify his belief , to confirm his confidence like light confirms a shadow , then belief might disappear from him entirely . <p> " This is my own affair , " Beatrice was protesting , her voice clear , but trembling with anger . " You do not own me , either one of you , and you have no right to be discussing me like this . " <p> " But I want to answer , " Andrew said . Carefully , he explained the experiment to her father . <p> Jonathan Crane whacked the folded paper against his palm . <p> " Ridiculous . Your ideas are nonsense . " <p> They began to argue then , worrying the properties of radium as they had once exhausted the properties of steel . They argued with such ferocity and passion that they forgot Beatrice entirely . It was her father who noticed first that the quality of silence had changed ; the rooftop with its intricate tile and urns of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , " he said gruffly , interrupting Byar . " She has gone . She chooses to ignore us both . " <p> Beatrice was near enough , standing just beyond the doorway , to hear her father say this . She did not wait for Andrew to reply . How little they understood , she thought , descending the ladder and the flight of stairs to her rooms . How much they took for granted , and chose not to see . She had never made Andrew any promises ; he had mistaken her silence for complicity , that was all . The experiment was no more her passion than were the distant and abstract patterns of the sky . Why be limited to seeing the stars as bulls and goats and scuttling crabs , when from another vantage point-from , say , the moon or Jupiter or Saturn-they might resemble something else entirely ? Or beyond even that , within another way of perceiving , within a new framework of thought , a person might discover patterns beyond what her father or Andrew Byar or anyone else imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightest insight about the mysteries of her own heart . Why , then , should she trust their vision of the world ? <p> Well , she would not . It did not take her long to pack a suitcase . <p> The house was silent . Roberto had proposed to her , and in the wake of her refusal he had in turn refused her father , turning his back on the steel trade and returning to Padua to study botany . I am free of you now , he had written on one terse postcard , and she had considered this for a moment before she wrote on the bottom , Your freedom brings me joy , and sent it back . <p> One suitcase , but it was heavy . She lugged it down the stairs and through the marble-floored foyer , grateful for the murmuring of the fountain , which masked her footsteps . Outside , Andrew 's car was waiting . The driver started the engine the instant he saw her in the doorway . Well , why not ? Beatrice thought , though she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ride-yes , why not ? The driver tossed his cigarette into the gravel and got out to put her bag in the back . Beatrice slid across the cool leather seat , folding her hands on the walnut desk , inhaling Andrew 's peculiar scent : cologne and cigars and an underlying whiff of steel . The liquid in his little bottles was odorless , but the car was filled with the aromas of money and autumn air , close counterparts , somehow . To the station , she instructed , and the driver pulled away . She glanced back at the house , wondering if Andrew and her father were still on the roof , discussing the stars or the stock market or her own stubborn nature . No matter , really . She would take the first train , wherever it might go . She picked up Andrew 's pen . Across the production figures , which he would see as soon as the car returned to fetch him , she wrote in bold black letters , My freedom brings me joy . <p> Beatrice traveled for nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Philadelphia and Washington , D.C. Stories of her wildness rippled in her wake , how she drank too much and danced barefoot in the snow and took lovers with careless abandon . Scandalous photos appeared in the society pages : Beatrice with her slender arms around one neck or another , the delicate rise of her breasts visible beneath her risque dresses . Beatrice dressed up like a man , dressed up like a bear , wearing a corona like a star . She was always laughing , but people noted that her wildness had made her thin , had lent a feverish quality to her eyes . They watched Andrew Byar slyly , too , commenting on how gaunt he 'd grown , waning like a moon in her absence . Or perhaps it was the strikes , which had begun just after the new furnace arrived and three hundred workers were laid off in the name of progress . In bloody protest , whole production lines had shut down for weeks , rendering meaningless the neat projections across which Beatrice had scrawled her liberation . <p> On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly ceased . The photos stopped . Her father made discreet inquiries , only to discover that no one had seen Beatrice since a party at an estate in the far reaches of the Adirondacks a month earlier , where she had danced frantically , people said , frenetically and without ceasing . She was there , dancing , and then she was gone . Just like that , disappeared , though no one had thought too much about it at the time . Perhaps she had stepped out onto a terrace for a breath of air , perhaps she had gone for a stroll . <p> No one had seen her pause on the side of the swirling room and light a cigarette . Or they had seen her and had not noticed , for the party was wild and everyone was drinking , and in the kinetic mosaic of the evening Beatrice was only one more fragment of color . She drew the smoke in deeply , watching the flash of arms and ankles , the beaded dresses glinting . Then she slipped through the French doors onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visual intensity of the party was separated from its noise , which came to her distantly now , muffled . She inhaled again , folding her bare arms against the night air . She had begun to smoke at some point , in Chicago , she thought it had been , where a young man had left his cigarettes on a table and she had slipped them into her purse . Chicago or Boston or New York : this was one discovery , that it really did n't matter . Whatever truth she 'd been seeking , trying on the laughter and the costumes and the men , she simply had not found . One by one she 'd discarded them , and now she stood here , at a party that was real , but also unreal , a place that was not her own . Her Pittsburgh life was lost as well , no more now than a dream . She had heard rumors of the strikes , of course , and through them rumors of Andrew . She had seen his photograph twice , and noted how he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meetings in the garden , so secret and exhilarating . She missed even Andrew and her father , for without their orderly views of the world to work against , to define her , the freedom she had gained had fallen flat . The room beyond the glass doors swayed and pulsed . Beatrice threw her cigarette , still smoldering , into the wet grass , and walked alone to the lake . <p> It was dark . Waves lapped at the shore . She slid her shoes off and waded to her ankles in the frigid water , so recently ice . In recent weeks the sensations of light had slowly left her , replaced now and then with mysterious shooting pains which came and went and finally came and stayed . In motion , she did not feel them , which was one reason she lived as she had . She squatted down and cupped the icy water in her hands , listening to the distant call of loons . A flash of white on the opposite shore caught her attention . She looked up , then held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trees . <p> Maybe it was nothing , or maybe nothing stranger than nasturtiums glinting sparks in the dusk of Andrew 's garden . But it seemed to Beatrice that she glimpsed her brother , standing as naturally amid the trees as a deer , one hand in his pocket and his head tilted at an angle , the forest at his back . For a long time , until her legs ached and began to tremble with the exertion of stillness , she did not move . When she stood , he was gone . But she was convinced that he had been there , that she had glimpsed something vital through these trees . Barefoot , still , she left the lake and followed him . <p> It was a near-wilderness , and night . In the house , people laughed and sang and fell asleep on sofas even as the music played , ices slipping from their hands . Days passed before her disappearance was discovered . Two weeks before search parties were dispatched , and yet another ten days before Beatrice was found , not by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become Eagle Scouts . Thin as a leaf , her clothes torn and dirty , she was sitting on a rock by a stream . She did not seem at all surprised to see them . " Oh , hello , " she said , standing and brushing dirt from her hands . " I 've been wondering when somebody would come . " <p> The boys clustered around her , astounded . To them she seemed like an enchanted creature , a deer that spoke , a shaft of light assuming human form . They were afraid at first , hesitant to offer her their arms . The unplanned hike back took most of a day , for the boys , inexperienced , were forced to stop often and consult their compasses . Also , Beatrice was weak . She walked slowly , and at first she walked in silence . After a few hours , though , she began to tell them stories , fantastic stories , of her weeks alone in the woods . Later they would argue over them , agreeing on the details but never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed , she had broken open maple trees no bigger than her finger and drunk the rising sap . She had stood in a shockingly hard rain , water dripping from her fingertips , from her hair , and watched a herd of elk move across a clearing . She had been following her brother at first , sighting the glint of his hair one moment and the flash of a limb another , but in the end he had disappeared , and she had been left alone . This she did not tell the boys , fearing it would frighten them , as it had frightened her , to hear of the dark nights she 'd spent , sleeping on moss or pine boughs , the nights so pure black that she could n't tell , finally , if the darkness was coming from within her or without . As it was , she frightened them , anyway . Her arm was no more than a living bone beneath their hands as they helped her across streams and over fallen logs . They imagined a dark forest of the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they let her go as soon as possible . <p> Beatrice saw the fear in their eyes ; she heard them saying , later , that she had lost her mind . In the wake of this derision she grew silent , aware that she could never explain how solitude , so unfamiliar and so perilous , had altered her forever . <p> In his great house on the bluffs , Andrew read of her rescue . No longer well himself , he spent most days in his sunny office , going through his papers , or sitting in the solarium with his wife . He studied the brief story on the back page which chronicled Beatrice 's emergence from the forest , leaves woven in her hair , dirt ground into her dress . <p> When she returned to Pittsburgh , he went to meet her at the station . She stepped from the train , dressed simply in a white silk skirt and a gray cashmere sweater . She was very thin . She is dying , he thought , which is what Beatrice thought , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunched and gray as a comma . Her heart swelled up with sadness , as well as with a sudden , inexplicable love . She knew as vividly as if she had seen it herself that the orchid was withered in the greenhouse , its flowers gone , its very leaves and stems marked with burns . She was twenty-one years old . <p> " I loved you , " Andrew whispered as she passed him . " You must believe me , Beatrice , I chose you out of love . " <p> " No , " she said . She spoke evenly , for her fear and bitterness had faded during her weeks in the forest . " It was not love between us then , never enough love from either you or me . I was your experiment . And you were part of mine . " <p> They did not speak again , though within months they were living in the same sanatorium . What they had observed in one another was terribly true : they were dying . Geiger counters clicked and chattered on their breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch raised bruises , the color of pale lilacs against thunderclouds , on their arms . The families came , bearing flowers , wine , books , news , the small comforts of the day-to-day , and if they passed one another in the halls they averted their eyes : whatever connection had existed between Andrew and Beatrice was ignored , as if ignoring might erase it . <p> One afternoon , when everyone had left , Beatrice stood , filled with an insatiable restlessness . She must move . The staircase was grand , built of hickory and curving down to the main floor , where French doors opened onto the gardens . It took her half an hour to descend . Outside , the grass was warm , thick , springing up beneath her bare feet . She felt a wave of pure astonishment at its texture , as if each blade pressed separately and softly against her flesh . <p> No one was in sight ; the sunlight was a warm hand , moving and returning . She thought of Andrew , how solemn he had been as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had believed in-had depended on-the certainties of science . She had never shared his belief , but she had no regrets . It was not , as some argued , misguided love or self-sacrifice or the whimsical nature of a young girl 's heart that had brought her to this moment . She had been no vessel for another 's dreams , no casualty in Andrew 's single-minded pursuit of scientific knowledge . It had been life she wanted , life she had embraced , no moment lost or left unexplored , no light or darkness left unseen . <p> Beatrice paused to rest on a ledge of stone . High up in the brick building , a curtain flickered in a window , lifting for an instant like a veil . I create the universe , she murmured , knowing it was in some strange sense true , for she understood now that the world was a shimmering place , shaped anew in every instant by the mystery of perception , each atom in constant if invisible motion . Except that suddenly for Beatrice the motion was visible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves , and the transitory beauty of the garden , the subtle shifts and alterations of even the boulders , left her breathless . <p> The wind lifted . Branches hummed , and then the stones began to groan , resonant and strange . All around her borders dissolved , spilling trees and flowers from their shapes ; the air was stained with color . Within herself , beyond herself , there was this swirl and glitter : this was the wondrous and terrifying knowledge she had gained . Beauty , too , and even a coherence in the way her thoughts themselves were splintered , coming to her in layers and rushes : her brother 's bright hair and the feel of a horse about to leap beneath her , her father 's reddened neck and the scent of baking biscuits floating through the house on a rainy day . And Andrew 's face in his luminous garden , so solemn and so full of hope . The elixir of life , he was saying , and now the stones were speaking , too , a chant reverberating through every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so powerful that even her own body began to blur and lose its form , cascading into the unstill world like petals falling , like water shattering , like every minute particle of light . <p>
