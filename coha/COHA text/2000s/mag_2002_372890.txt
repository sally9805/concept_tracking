WAR GAMES <P> There was a clear military presence at the Electronic Entertainment Expo ( E3 ) in Los Angeles last week , and it had nothing to do with terror alerts or heightened security . The U.S. Army , eager to boost recruitment among 18-to-24-year-olds , is getting into the computer-game business . In July it will release two titles : Soldiers , a Sims-style basic-training exercise based on interviews with more than 700 real-life grunts ; and Operations , a fast-paced online game that puts you behind the trigger  --  and teaches you teamwork  --  in a combat situation . Operations is built with the same software as the popular shooting game Unreal , but Army know-how has made the scenarios significantly more , er , real . Both game CDs will be available for free in computer-gaming magazines . And at Army recruiting stations . <P> COOL HAND <P> As any veteran video gamer knows , it 's not the bad guys that get you ; it 's the sweat . For anyone who has ever lost crucial points due to a too slippery controller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it thinks is the perfect solution : air-conditioning . The AirFlo plugs into the console and keeps palms nicely ventilated while you play . It will be available for PlayStation 2 , Xbox and GameCube in July for $50 . That 's twice the price of A/C-free controllers , but not any more than most video games . Cool .  --  By Chris Taylor/ Los Angeles
