Temple Newsam House in Leeds , England , has a rich history extending back to the Domesday Book in 1086 , when the manor of Newsam ( or Neuhusum ) , meaning " new houses , " was first recorded . The property was bought in 1622 by Sir Arthur Ingram ( 1565 or 1570-1642 ) who reconfigured the old Tudor house , demolishing three sides and rebuilding two new wings to the north and south , uniting the whole in 1628 ( Fig. 1 ) . It remained in the hands of nine successive Viscounts Irwin into the middle of the eighteenth century and thereafter their descendants until Edward Frederick Lindley Wood ( 1881-1959 ) , later Viscount Halifax , sold it to the Leeds Corporation in 1922.1 Photograph Facing page : Fig. 1 .

From its introduction in the early sixteenth century in the Westerwald and its subsequent introduction by German and Dutch potters into England in the mid-seventeenth century , salt-glazed stoneware vessels , which were impermeable to liquids and made hygienic by their clear lustrous silica glaze , changed food storage and consumption habits . But the Rhenish white salt-glazed stoneware was a far cry from the English manifestation of the same technology , which at its finest compares favorably with imported Chinese porcelains . Indeed , such lovely white salt-glazed was produced nowhere else . Traded abroad from at least 1700 , English salt-glazed stoneware remains the staple staple British fine ceramic found at both European and American colonial sites . Photograph Figs. 5. 5a .

The high firing fuses the body , making it impervious to liquids . In and of itself this could be the end of the stoneware process , but to enhance the surface of the pot and add luster or sheen , salt is added to the kiln when it reaches at least 1150 degrees centigrade . The salt , introduced into the kiln for at least six hours , volatilizes onto the pot , followed by a clear fire when hydrochloric acid gas , a noxious and harmful by-product , is spewed out of the kiln vents . The manufacture of salt-glazed stoneware in the British Isles began in the last two decades of the seventeenth century when John Dwight ( c. 1635-1703 ) began the well-known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was well established in North Staffordshire , where the majority of it remained until it was gradually replaced by the more versatile and popular creamware body in the 1770s . Evidence for the manufacture of white salt-glazed stoneware in Leeds rests primarily on excavations carried out at the " Pottery Fields " site on Jack Lane in 1977 by Peter Wallon and others.2 Because the creamware and salt-glazed stoneware bodies are virtually identical in their physical makeup , differing only in the firing temperature ( higher for salt-glaze ) and the glazing technique , factories that made creamware in the third quarter of the eighteenth century usually had also made salt-glazed stoneware . Wasters , kiln furniture , and glazed saggers found in the Pottery Fields excavations make it a certainly that salt-glaze was manufactured in Leeds.3 Another factory existed there in the 1760s or possibly earlier , the Joseph Dennison factory in Holbeck , which was advertised for sale in 1769 , the year before the Leeds Pottery was established . The exact location of the Dennison pottery is not known , but the dates make it likely that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Yorkshire by the 1860s and 1870s . In 1868 a large exhibition of English pottery and porcelain was mounted in the newly completed Leeds Infirmary , lent by such well-known collectors as Dr. H. W. Diamond and William Edkins as well as local notables in the field such as John Rhodes and John Manning.5 One of the lenders to the exhibition was W. H. Thorpe , the architect of the Leeds City Art Gallery , completed in 1888.6 The majority of the salt-glaze at Temple Newsam came by bequest from the collection amassed by Hollings . He had lived at Calverley , between Leeds and Bradford , where he managed the old established business of Isaac Hollings and Sons , a woolens concern operating from the Holly Park Mill Company . He began collecting in the early ware of the twentieth century when many important collections of English pottery were coming onto the market , namely the L.M. Solon sale ( 1912 ) , the Thomas Boynton side ( 1920 ) , the Cyril Andrade sale ( 1925 ) , the Micah Salt sale ( 1927 ) , the Florence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Biyan T. Harland sale ( 1931 ) , Lord Revelstoke 's collection ( 1934 ) . the Constance Freeth sale ( 1937 ) , and the Wallace Elliot sales in 1926 and 1938 . The Hollings notebooks , annotated with the price he paid for each object in the sales , are fascinating records of their kind . The highest prices he paid for pieces of salt-glaze included 200 for a scratch-blue mug dated 1749 ( Fig. 4 ) , purchased in 1918 from the Manchester dealer M. J. Davis , and more than 152 for the Admiral Vernon mug commemorating the Battle of Portobello in 1739 ( Fig. 3 ) , acquired from the Thomas Tylston Greg collection , also in 1918 . These high prices reflect what was , and continues to be , a universal fascination with dated and commemorative ceramics . Most of the prices Hollings paid for salt-glaze were in the 1 to 5 range . Although specific salt-glazed wares manufactured in the Leeds region are difficult to identify , often being popular generic forms or press-molded wares with the mosaic or barleycorn patterns that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 what we how come to associate with Leeds enameling is more easily recognized . The decorating studio of Jasper Robinson ( w. 1760-1778 ) and David Rhodes was operating sometime before October 28 , 1760 , when the Leeds Intelligenncer earned the following advertisement : " ROBINSON and RHODES , Opposite the George , in Briggate , Leeds , ENAMEL and BURN in colours ....

Hollings bequest . // The fact the firm was established ten ware before the existence of the Leeds Pottery suggests that other factories were producing salt-glazed ( and undoubtedly other earthenwares ) in the Leeds area . Robinson continued on in Leeds until 1778 , but Rhodes moved to London in 1768 , where he established a decorating studio . It is the painting he did there for Wedgwood and others that has led to the identification of the Leeds style of enameling . The iron red and black palelle associated with Rhodes 's painting widened to include other colors , such as manganese purple , yellow , and blue . The ornamentation includes hastily and boldly sketched buildings with narrow bodies and chimneys with smoke walling upward , blue and crimson clouds , as well as stylized trees made with lateral feathery brushstrokes . Several pieces in Temple Newsam House might have been decorated at the Leeds enameling studio , probably during Rhodes 's tenancy , among them the teapot in Figures 2a and 2b , which could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leeds for decorating . It is painted with the figure known as Miss Pit on one side and a cartouche with Rhodes style buildings in grisaille on the other . A bowl , formerly in the collection of Lady Charlotte Schreiber who gave it to her daughter , Blanche , Countess Bessborough ( Figs. 5 and 5a ) , is enamel decorated with a Miss Pit style couple drinking punch at a teu table with wispy blue clouds drifting above.9 Another center for salt-glaze manufacture in Yorkshire was Rotherham , wheiv John Platt and Samuel Walker Jr . operated a pottery from 1766 to 1770 . The identifiable wares attributed to the enterprise are few in number but among them is a jug in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London inscribed " John Platt 1767 " and a footed bowl at Colonial Williamsburg Foundation in Virginia with similar painting and inscribed " IC 1767 . " Probably from the same hand is the bowl in Figure 6 , which is painted in a similar style.10 The preponderance of salt-glaze at Temple Newsam House emanates from North Staffordshire and includes many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and architectural forms made possible by the advent in the 1740s of slip-casting and molding techniques for both earthenwares and stonewares ( see Figs. 8 and 9 ) . Such teapots are probably among those described in an advertisement in the London Daily Advertiser on August 24 , 1747 : " To be Sold/ Facing the Door of the Old London Spaw , in Spau Fields during Welch Fair . All sorts of Welch Ware , Derby and Staffordshire fine Stone Ware , amongst which are a great Variety of Curious Tea-Pots of all sizes , that far excel either Silver or China , both for Drawing or Pouring , and not inferior in beauty .

In 1734 the Swedish industrial spy Reinhold Rcker Angerstein traveling in England observed . " Flowers and leaves that were placed on teapots were also pressed , but in moulds , and generally of a whiter material than the grey base . " 11 One unusual teapot in the collection has the colors reversed with a white body and drab-colored sprigging ( Fig. 7 , left ) . Littler-Wedgwood coloring , with an overall cobalt blue dip , probably developed as early as 1749,12 was a dramatic innovation that made a bold statement on early salt-glazed stoneware . Commonly the ware was left unembellished and distinguished by doing so , but sometimes additions were made in gilding or white enamel , or sprigging in blue ( Fig. 10 ) . A most unusual mug in the collection ( Fig. 11 ) seems to be one of only about twenty examples of stoneware that is both tin-glazed and salt-glazed . Most examples in the group are decorated in overall cobalt blue , increasing the rarity of Temple Nwwsam 's mug with its exotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen on porcelains than on either tin-glazed earthenware or salt-glazed stoneware . The pinched handle terminal links the mug to salt-glazed stoneware , whereas the baluster form and decoration link it in the world of porcelain , particularly that from Liverpool , where Richard Chaffers ( w. 1755-1765 ) and William Reid ( w. 1755-1761 ) made mugs of similar shape and decoration . But how the glazing was done remains a mystery . Alan Smith analyzes it thus : If a salt-glazed pot was dipped in tin-glaze materials prior to a second firing it would be difficult to make the glaze substances adhere , due to the imperevius nature of the already fired and glazed body . Some unevenness in the glazing , and ' creeping ' of the tin-glaze on some of the examples in the group suggests that this was the case . However , if we accept that the making of the so-called Littler 's blue was achieved by coating the pot in a cobalt slip before subjecting it to a salt-glaze firing as suggested by Simeon Shaw History of the Staffodshire Potteries ( 1829 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were first given a coating of tin-glaze on the biscuit ( as in conventional delftware ) and subsequently fired in the salt-glaze oven ? 13 Photograph Fig. 11 . Mug . Liverpool , c. 1760 . Tin-glazed salt-glazed stoneware with painted enamel decoration ; height 5 1/8 inches . Collection of W. Ambrose Harding , on loan to Temple Newsam House . // Smith notes that whatever techniques were used to achieve this ceramic anomaly they must nut have been considered successful , since so few examples survive . The manufacturers were clearly experimenting with characteristics that combined lightness of body with physical strength and resistance to thermal shock when used tor hot liquids , characteristics that are not associated with delftware . All this suggests a Liverpool origin , but does not necessitate it.14 By and large the most attractive salt-glaze at Temple Newsam is the enameled ware . Enamel decoration on salt-glazed stoneware was not a particularly early decorative technique . Scratch brown and blue were the most popular early eighteenth-century forms decoration , followed by molded and slip-cast decorative wares . The earliest known surviving dated piece with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Albert Museum , followed by another dated mug in Colonial Williamsburg dated 1747.15 Both of these appear to have been decorated by independent London enamelers who would have been decorating , in addition to salt-glaze , both Chinese and ( later ) English porcelain as well as glass . Enamel-painled wares in Temple Newsam date primarily from the 1750s and 1760s , the heyday of beautifully painted salt-glazed stoneware . One large and beautifully painted jug ( Fig. 13 ) was purchased by Hollings from Lord Revelstoke 's sale in 1934 . Coffee- and chocolate pots with chinoiserie painting ( see Fig. 15 ) and one unusual lighthouse-shaped coffeepot ( Fig. 14 ) with a lavender ground all appear to have been decorated during the salient period in Staffordshire .
