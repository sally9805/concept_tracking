French physician Rene Laennec invented the stethoscope , but he could not diagnose himself . <p> The French physician Rene Laennec did n't set out to invent the stethoscope . It just sort of happened one day in September 1816 when he needed a little help in examining an obese woman . Her many layers of insulation effectively muffled the beating of her heart . <p> The usual method of examination , which entailed having the physician lay either the hand or ear to the chest , would have been of no use in this case because of what Laennec described as " the great degree of fatness . " Moreover , he and other physicians were not too keen on this method to begin with . Laennec noted it was uncomfortable for both doctor and patient , a bit too intimate for a hospital setting , and unsuitable for most women because , with some , " the very size of their breasts was a physical obstacle to the employment of this method . " The 35-year-old Laennec was still a bachelor and a stickler for propriety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered a " simple and well-known fact in acoustics "  --  that is , that sound is augmented when conveyed through certain solid bodies , such as wood . Not having a suitable piece of wood handy , Laennec rolled " a quire of paper 24 sheets into a sort of cylinder and applied one end of it to the region of the heart and the other to my ear . " To his great surprise and pleasure , it worked  --  and he was able to " perceive the action of the heart in a manner much more clear and distinct than I have ever been able to do by the immediate application of the ear . " <p> Laennec knew a good thing when he heard it and said he immediately began thinking of additional applications for his " instrument . " He imagined that it might be used not only to listen to the heart " but of every species of sound produced by the motion of all the thoracic viscera . " Almost by accident , he had devised what medical historians would later describe as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 1890s . " <p> The French remained loyal to Laennec 's rigid , monaural model for years , but the British and others experimented with more flexible designs that were easier to use . Still , it was n't until 1840 that a New York physician , Dr. George P. Camman , devised a binaural stethoscope having an ebony chest plate and two ivory-tipped hearing pieces that defined the modern instrument . <p> The stethoscope made objective diagnosis possible by providing the physician with greatly enhanced audible clues to the patient 's physical condition . Previously , doctors had to rely primarily on the patient 's descriptions of his or her symptoms , which often were unreliable and , sometimes , even misleading . <p> Laennec himself is an unfortunate case in point . Perhaps the most brilliant diagnostician of his time , he consistently mischaracterized his own medical problems as a variety of ailments-gout , asthma , angina pectoris , and nervous exhaustion , among others  --  to avoid dealing with the awful possibility that he might be suffering from tuberculosis . The irony is even more pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field and was the first to show that tuberculosis lesions could be found not only in the lungs but in any organ of the body , even the bones . <p> In the months that followed his discovery of the stethoscope , despite his frail health , Laennec devoted himself to defining the instrument 's diagnostic potential . In Doctors : The Biography of Medicine , author Sherwin Nuland wrote that Laennec " tirelessly followed patient after patient from the ward to the autopsy table , correlating what he heard with what he later saw .... Thus , he was the first physician to be able to differentiate between the diseases called bronchiectasis , pneumothorax , hemorrhagic pleurisy , emphysema , lung abscess , and pulmonary infarct . " <p> In August 1818 , Laennec completed the two-volume summary of his work entitled " On Mediate Auscultation , or a Treatise on the Diagnosis of Diseases of the Lungs and Heart Based Principally on the New Method of Investigation " ( " De l'auscultation mediate ... " ) . Laennec had adopted the term " auscultation " from the Latin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to listen carefully . " The word " mediate " indicated that the auscultation was not direct but mediated by " le cylindre . " <p> Thus , Nuland notes , " a new book , a new instrument , a new terminology , a new nosology , and a new philosophy of diagnosis had been introduced in two volumes of print which could be bought for 13 francs . For three francs more , the publisher threw in a stethoscope , very likely fashioned by the author himself on his own home lathe . " <p> Shortly after completing the book , Laennec collapsed  --  no doubt another manifestation of his smoldering tuberculosis . Yet he continued to deny the symptoms and maintained , at least in public , that he had suffered something akin to a nervous breakdown from stress and overwork . <p> But he did decide he needed to make certain lifestyle changes if he wanted to go on living . He took a three-month holiday at a small estate he had inherited in his native Brittany , but that short hiatus did little to restore his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his book , he put his career on hold and left Paris to return again to Brittany . <p> It was a difficult decision dictated by the knowledge that he no longer had the strength to do his job in accordance with his own professional standards . He wrote his physician-uncle , who had raised him after his mother died when he was six : " I much prefer to go and vegetate , and do as much good as I can at Kerlouanec his estate . After all , so long as I can make ends meet , I shall be happy there . " <p> The quiet life of a gentleman farmer agreed with him and had the additional advantage of isolating him from much of the criticism directed at " De l'auscultation mediate ... " by the anti-stethoscope crowd , who perceived the instrument as something of a threat to the established order . Like most great medical advances , it took some time to be generally accepted . Laennec biographer Roger Kervran noted that the stethoscope " was the object of endless jokes . Those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> After two years of fresh air and regular exercise , he felt well enough to return to Paris and resume his practice , although he no longer made house calls . It probably was an unwise decision because Laennec himself had written , " Although nature is able to cure tuberculosis , medical treatment has , so far , failed to do so . " <p> But his health remained relatively good for a time . He plunged into his new position as professor and royal lecturer at the College de France , where he established himself as a great teacher , as well as a great physician . Doctors and students by the hundreds flocked from all over Europe and even North America to follow him on his rounds through the Charite hospital , observe him in the autopsy room , and listen to his lectures . Most became confirmed disciples and returned home with their stethoscopes to spread the Laennec gospel of clinical diagnosis . <p> But his tuberculosis continued its relentless progress and , by the spring of 1826 , Laennec no longer could deny its existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brittany . He died there on August 13 , 1826 , and was buried in a nearby cemetery . <p> He was only 45 when he died , but those years had been tumultuous ones , " the best of times and the worst of times " in France . As a youth in Nantes , he had observed firsthand some of the worst excesses of the Reign of Terror , which followed the euphoria of the French Revolution . In Paris , he witnessed the rise and fall of Napoleon and again became directly involved by treating the casualties of battle in the French military hospitals . <p> Yet , through it all , he remained remarkably productive in his field , causing one of his colleagues to wonder " how a man , whose constant state of suffering allowed so little time for study , could produce works which seemed only possible as the fruit of a very long career . " The answer , he decided , was that " ordinary rules do not apply to men of genius . " <p> ILLUSTRATION ( COLOR ) <p> By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
