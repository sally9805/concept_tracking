PROLOGUE // On Sunday evening , March 25 , 1979 , the NBC Sports production team gathered in a conference room at the Hotel Utah in Salt Lake City to go over the game plan for the following night ? s NCAA men ? s basketball championship game . George Finkel , the game producer , spoke first . He laid out the manner in which he and his broadcasting team of Dick Enberg , Al McGuire , and Billy Packer would be presenting the contest between Michigan State and Indiana State . // The next person to speak was Don McGuire ( no relation to Al ) , who produced the pregame , halftime , and postgame segments that were hosted by Bryant Gumbel . Before beginning a career in television , McGuire had worked as the sports information director at the University of New Mexico , where the associate athletic director was a man named Bob King . King had since moved on to become head basketball coach at Indiana State University , but before the start of the 1978-79 season , he developed an aneurysm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That forced King to hand over the reins to his young assistant , Bill Hodges , who despite having no previous head coaching experience had guided the Sycamores to a stunning 33-0 record and a berth in the national championship game . Now , McGuire told the group that he wanted to air a story on King , the incapacitated head coach , during NBC ? s pregame segment on Monday night . // McGuire was abruptly interrupted by Don Ohlmeyer , the executive producer of NBC Sports . A large , domineering , and sometimes bombastic man , Ohlmeyer had spent a decade at ABC Sports learning at the knee of the legendary producer Roone Arledge . While working for the popular , eclectic program Wide World of Sports , Ohlmeyer learned the importance of developing a story line to pump up interest in a sporting event . // " Nobody cares about Bob King , " Ohlmeyer said to Don McGuire . " What about Magic and Bird ? " // Ohlmeyer was referring to Earvin " Magic " Johnson and Larry Bird , the All-American stars at Michigan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence fell on the room . " Well , " McGuire said , " Dick , Al , and Billy are going to be talking a lot about those two during the game . And we ? ve got a highlights piece set to music ready to go for halftime . " // " Well , you ? re going to do them in the pregame , too , " Ohlmeyer snapped . " Those guys are the stars here . That ? s who people want to see . " // Ohlmeyer ? s edict left McGuire in a bit of a pickle . In the first place , he now had less than twenty-four hours to put together a quality piece . More problematic was Bird ? s notorious antipathy toward the media . He had gone through most of the season without speaking to the press , and McGuire had no idea whether Bird would consent to be interviewed so close to tip-off . // The following morning , Don McGuire sent Packer and a camera crew to the University of Utah ? s Special Events Center , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shootaround . Fortunately for NBC , Bird agreed to answer a couple of questions . Packer began by asking him how he felt about playing for the national championship . // " Well , this is probably the biggest game I ? ll ever play in my life , " Bird replied in his high-pitched Hoosier twang , which made " life " sound like " lahff . " As he spoke , Larry looked not at Packer but straight ahead and slightly downward . He had a disconcerting habit of resisting eye contact with people he didn ? t know well . // Bird continued , " I just feel like I ? m representing not only myself and my team , but we ? re representing our school and our town , Terre Haute . It means so much to me just to even be here that we ? re gon na give it all we got , and we ? re gon na try our hardest to win . " // " You know , " Packer said , " a lot of people were surprised yesterday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson in the World Invitational Tournament . " Packer was referring to the tournament the two of them played for Team USA the previous summer that culminated with a game against a squad from Russia in Lexington , Kentucky . // Larry cracked a wry smile . " Well , you know me and Magic played in that game , and you know it ? s funny ? cause Magic ? s such a great passer , but he wouldn ? t give me the ball . And you know I need the ball . " // The interview had been surprisingly pleasant and light . Larry left the court with his team , and the Michigan State Spartans strode into the arena . Packer knew there was no concern over whether Magic Johnson would consent to an interview . The broadcaster had never dealt with an athlete who so enjoyed the give-and-take with the media . // " It ? s a dream come true , really , for me , " Johnson said in answer to Packer ? s first question . " I won a state title in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my next accomplishment was going to the NCAA and playing a game like tonight in the finals . It ? s a dream come true , and like I said , it ? s an awful important game . I just hope we play up to par and win the game . " // Packer then told Magic what Bird had said about him . Johnson flashed the bright ivory smile that would soon earn him millions of dollars . " Well , I hope he don ? t think I ? m gon na pass it to him tonight , either . But I thought I passed him the ball . Maybe he forgot . " // Don McGuire was pleased to hear that Packer ? s excursion had been successful . He now had enough material to make NBC ? s pregame show an all-Magic-and-Bird affair . In retrospect , it seems inconceivable that anyone involved in producing the game could have failed to recognize the significance of the impending confrontation between these two compelling characters . Ohlmeyer , however , possessed an innate sense of theater that allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a hard-core basketball audience . He knew that if NBC could draw in the casual sports fan , and even the nonsports fan , the network would have something bigger than just a game . It would have an event . // By one measure , the impact of the 1979 NCAA championship game would be apparent a few days later . Nielsen Media Research reported that the contest had generated a 24.1 rating , which meant that nearly a quarter of all television sets in America were tuned in that night . Thirty years later , that remains the highest Nielsen rating for any basketball game , college or pro , in the history of the sport . Thanks to the proliferation of channels that has taken place since then , it ? s unlikely the number will ever be surpassed by another basketball game . Consider that the 2008 NCAA final between the University of Memphis and the University of Kansas yielded a 12.1 Nielsen rating , a healthy number by modern standards . When Magic ? s and Bird ? s former pro teams , the Los @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2008 NBA Finals , it was hailed as a dream scenario for the league . Yet the highest rating any of the six games delivered was a 10.7. // While the success that Magic and Bird later enjoyed in the pros added retrospective luster to their first meeting , it does not account for the intense interest the two of them generated that night . Those millions of viewers had no idea they were watching the birth of the most storied rivalry in modern American sports . They were simply drawn in by the dramatic story line ripped straight out of the Old Testament : little Indiana State , which had competed in the NCAA ? s Division I for only ten years , was taking on Michigan State , the mighty Big Ten team , for the title . That concept might not have been so titillating if they were playing a best-of-seven series , but the one-and-done format of the NCAA tournament made it irresistible . Anything could happen , the thinking went , so you ? d better watch . " This was a classic David versus Goliath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel like this was a once-in-a-lifetime event . " // " It was testimony to America ? s fervor for the underdog , " Dick En-berg says . " Here comes Indiana State and this big blond guy and four chemistry majors . The argument was , they played in a minor league . Are they really that good ? And they ? re matched up against the Big Ten power . Dramatically speaking , it was truth strangling fiction . " // Bird ? s story strangled fiction by itself . Many people knew the skeletal details  --  small-town farm boy drops out of Indiana University , spends a year working on a garbage truck , resurfaces at Indiana State , and leads the Sycamores through a storybook undefeated season  --  but before the championship game , Indiana State had played on national television just three times . The 1979 NCAA final gave many Americans their first glimpse of Bird . " You didn ? t get to see everybody on television all the time . So in those days , it was a big treat when the tournament finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sportswriter for the Boston Globe . Bird ? s tight-lipped approach to the media only added to his allure . " There was just enough known about Bird and just enough unknown , " says Lynn Henning , who was a columnist at Michigan State ? s hometown paper , the State Journal . " A little mystery goes a long way . " // Bird was so underexposed that his roommate and teammate at Indiana State , Bob Heaton , would later say that up until the championship game he had friends in Denver ( where Heaton had played before transferring to Indiana State ) who thought Larry was black . This touches on another aspect of Bird ? s matchup with Magic that drew in the big audience . The two central protagonists were both highly skilled big men who wore the number 33 , but the similarities ended there . Magic was black ; Bird was white . Magic loved being the center of attention ; Bird was painfully shy . Magic grew up in urban Lansing ; Bird was the hick from French Lick . Magic played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Bird toiled in obscurity for the small college that competed in something called the Missouri Valley Conference . // Most of all , America tuned in to the 1979 NCAA championship game in record numbers because people understood that these two young men played a unique , exquisite style of basketball . It wasn ? t their physical gifts that drew folks in . Magic and Bird weren ? t especially quick or agile , and neither man would be a candidate for the high jump . Yet they were intense competitors and great thinkers on the court . Those qualities manifested themselves in the prettiest play of all : the pass . More than anything , Magic and Bird were great passers . They were truly something to see . // " Magic was a six-eight point guard and that was certainly unique , but it wasn ? t as if he was David Thompson . It wasn ? t as if he was Michael Jordan , " says Dave Kindred , who covered the game for the Washington Post . " He succeeded because he knew how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? m not going to deny they were great athletes or had great hand-eye coordination , but they weren ? t preternaturally gifted athletes . Watching them was watching basketball the way it should be played . " // On that Monday evening , more than two thousand miles from where Indiana State and Michigan State were taking the court in Salt Lake City , the general counsel of the National Basketball Association was settling in front of a television in the living room of his home in Scars-dale , New York . The NBA was in the midst of a terrible season beset by sagging attendance , plummeting TV ratings , and the growing perception that white America would never buy in to a sport dominated by black players . David Stern wouldn ? t become the NBA ? s commissioner for another five years but , as he watched Magic and Bird go at it that night , he couldn ? t help but hope the pro game was about to get a badly needed boost . " We were very excited at the NBA that these two extraordinarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our way , " he says . // Some eighty miles northeast of Stern ? s home , a dozen or so ambitious , young wannabe television executives were wrapping up another long day of work in their cramped offices in Bristol , Connecticut . They had spent the day continuing their preparations for the launch of a new cable television venture , the Entertainment and Sports Programming Network , which would soon be known as ESPN . The official launch date was September 7 , and the channel ? s founder , Bill Rasmussen , had signed a deal a few weeks before with NCAA executive director Walter Byers to broadcast all the NCAA championship contests that were not being aired by one of the big three networks . The deal gave ESPN the rights to use NBC ? s feed of the early rounds of the NCAA tournament , beginning in 1980 . " We kept telling ourselves , this time next year we ? re going to do the games leading up to this one , " Rasmussen says . " Having a contract with the NCAA was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really built on college basketball . " // From his courtside seat at the scorer ? s table in Salt Lake City , Dave Gavitt sensed he was glimpsing into a bountiful future for the sport . Gavitt , the soft-spoken , whip-smart athletic director at Providence College , was serving his first season as a member of the NCAA men ? s basketball committee , and having participated in the NCAA ? s negotiations with ESPN , he understood better than most the potential that the emergence of cable television offered . Over the previous few months , Gavitt had secretly met with coaches and administrators from Georgetown University , St. John ? s University , and Syracuse University in hopes of convincing them to join Providence in a new basketball conference that would comprise schools located in the major television markets of the northeast . Gavitt did not realize how quickly his brainstorm would come to fruition  --  the Big East would begin competing during the 1979-80 season  --  but as the Magic-Bird faceoff got under way , he sensed his idea was coming along at an opportune time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make it bigger , " Gavitt says . " We felt like we were on the cusp of that with college basketball and the NCAA tournament . " // As Stern , Rasmussen , and Gavitt watched the 1979 NCAA championship game , each was optimistic that it would have a positive impact on his own corner of the basketball world . But because they could not perceive all the external forces aligning that night , they could not fully comprehend what was really happening . // The game of basketball was about to change forever . // The 1979 NCAA championship game helped to catapult college basketball , and especially the NCAA tournament , into the national consciousness . In fact , the game kicked off a six-year stretch that could fairly be characterized as the golden era of the NCAA tournament . Between 1979 and 1985 , the tournament introduced to the country six players who would dominate the NBA over the next two decades : Magic Johnson , Larry Bird , Isiah Thomas , Michael Jordan , Patrick Ewing , and Hakeem Olajuwon . That period also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : North Carolina State over Houston in 1983 and Villanova over Georgetown in 1985. // In 1979 , the NCAA tournament was expanded to include forty teams ( up from thirty-two the year before ) . The tournament was expanded twice more over the next five years  --  to forty-eight teams in 1980 and to sixty-four in 1985 . With the exception of the addition of the sixty-fifth team to accommodate an opening-round game in 2001 , the tournament has not been expanded since . // The television rights fees have undergone a similar explosion . The 1979 NCAA tournament grossed $5.2 million in TV revenue . That figure doubled when NBC renewed its contract for two years in 1980 . When CBS wrested the rights from NBC prior to the 1982 tournament , it paid $48 million for three years . CBS ? s price doubled again when it forked over $96 million for another three years in 1985 . The fees grew so fast that in 1999 CBS and the NCAA agreed to an eleven-year , $6 billion deal that commenced with the 2003 tournament . // During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built its popularity on the dominance of John Wooden ? s UCLA Bruins , who won ten championships in twelve years . Many observers worried that the tournament would falter when that run ended in 1975 , but the Magic-Bird championship game firmly stamped the NCAA tournament as the place where stars are born and the impossible becomes possible . It also came at a most propitious moment : the dawn of the cable TV era that would be dominated by ESPN , when administrators like Dave Gavitt were maneuvering to acquire more exposure for their universities , during a period when the NBA had so much room to grow under its soon-to-be new commissioner David Stern . As the NBA prospered in the 1980s thanks to the Magic-Bird rivalry , the league continued to offer a forum where fans could enjoy the great athletes they first discovered during the month of March . // Thus , as Indiana State and Michigan State convened at center court in Salt Lake on March 26 , 1979 , all the pieces were falling into place to transform basketball . The only thing those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into true madness . " The college game was already on the launching pad , " Al McGuire said . " Then Bird and Magic came along and pushed the button .
