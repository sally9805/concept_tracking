Fishing is good then , better even than in the spring , because you do n't have to deal with high water or abrupt weather changes that put bass off their feed . As autumn winds gradually cool shoreline waters , shad start migrating up the feeder streams of lakes to feed or to spawn . As they go , the larger bass that have stalked them all summer follow in roving packs . Hunger does n't make the lunkers easy prey for anglers , though . They never would have grown so large otherwise . Such bass ca n't all be caught on the same lures , using identical techniques under similar circumstances . You have to fish like a pro to be successful in the fall . The following advice , from people who catch bass for a living , should help in that regard . 1 . Shallow Cover and Big Bass Denny Brauer is the B.A.S.S . all-time money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million in prizes . The Missouri pro has earned similar accolades and payouts participating in the FLW tournament circuit . More than anything else , jigs have been responsible for Brauer 's success , and he sticks with them throughout the year . In the fall , he swims jigs to get bass on the line . His approach is predicated on the belief that big bass , or at least some of them , are shallow-water homebodies that stake out shoreline cover such as docks , laydown trees and aquatic weeds . Rather than stalking baitfish around a lake , such lunkers wait for shad to come to them . " My choice for all types of cover is a Strike King premier Pro-Model jig with a Strike King 3X Chunk trailer , " says Brauer . " I use either one-quarter- or three-eighths-ounce models . The quarter-ounce jig is easier to swim but the heavier jig is easier to present on a windy day , and you can get the heavier jig into the strike zone quicker and keep it there better . " Once Brauer has a target @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his bait-casting outfit , which is teamed with 50-pound-test Stren Super Braid . He lets the jig sink a foot or two below the surface and then retrieves the lure by pumping the rod while reeling in slack line . " I hold the rod tip up at about ten o'clock ; I 've really got to watch the line and set the hook as soon as a bass strikes because the rod is already so high , " says Brauer . The reason why Brauer swims the jig instead of letting it sink is because he believes that in the fall , bass suspend in cover that is at about the same level as baitfish . To be efficient predators , the bass have to have cover , whether it 's the shade under a dock or water weeds . " I like a white jig with a pearl-white Chunk behind it , especially if the water is clear , " says Brauer . " This approach will catch bass of all sizes , but mainly it will catch the bigger fish . The big boys have a home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them . " 2 . Check All Depths With a Mix of Lures Shaw Grigsby is a veteran of 10 bass master Classic championships and one of the top all-time money winners in professional bass angling . He thinks that once a fisherman finds a big concentration of shad , he 's won half the battle . " Once I find shad , I look for the closest structureditches or channelswith associated wood or weeds , " says the Florida angler . " I believe that bass will stay in aquatic grass until it dies down ; then they 'll move to wood or rocks . If you find shad in an area that has those cover ingredients , you 're in the right place . " When he 's fishing a typical Southern lake , Grigsby likes to start shallow and move deeper as he has to . In early fall , it 's likely that many bass will still be in deeper haunts ; late in the season , they will have moved up to the bank . " I do n't really have one lure that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll start with a shad-colored spinnerbait and work shallow cover . Another good bait is a white jig or a Strike King Pro-Model Flip-N-Tube . " If fish are n't positioned near inshore cover , Grigsby will go prospecting , blind-casting with lipless crankbaits such as a Diamond Shad . " I 'm really concentrating on the shad bite , " says Grigsby . " If the bass have n't moved to the banks in that cove or stretch or feeder creek , I 'll start working my way out and fish deeper . The bass are close . " Grigsby 's favorite rig to explore offshore waters in the fall is a Carolina-rigged plastic worm . The Florida pro backs away from the shore far enough to fish submerged points and the flats between the bank and drop-offs . Once he gets a strike or two , he might switch to another lure that covers more water faster , such as a diving or lipless crankbait . " To some extent , where you start fishing in the fall depends on the latitude of the reservoir you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early fall and the water is still fairly warm , you might want to start offshore . If the water has already cooled down , start at the bank . " 3 . A Rig Bass Ca n't Resist Although Bill Dance retired from professional bass fishing many years ago to focus on a long-running television program , he 's still acknowledged as one of the all-time greats of the sport . The Tennessee angler knows that as good as fall fishing can be , there are times when bass will loaf offshore and leave shad alone . Faced with such challenging times , Dance has developed a foolproof way to put bass in the boat . But be forewarned , this tactic requires patience and persistence . " One of my best fall fishing tricks is to use tube jigs to catch inactive suspended bass in areas where there seem to be a lot of shad present , " says Dance . " In fact , it 's also a great technique for winter fishing . If you can get a tube jig down in the faces of bass that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds . " Job one is using his bow-mounted sonar to locate bass on or near offshore structure such as ledges . Once he finds them , Dance uses a spinning outfit with 14-pound-test Stren Superbraid to cast a 4-inch Yum Garrett Mega Tube ( rigged on a 5/0 Gamakatsu EWG hook ) or a 3 1/2-inch Yum Vibra King Finesse Jig ( with a 4/0 Gamakatsu ) and presents the bait so that it falls very slowly into the strike zone . Shad and Arkansas shiner are his two favorite colors . " Suppose I see bass on my fish-finder graph at fifteen feet , " says Dance . " I want the tube to drop about a foot every three seconds . It 's going to take about forty-five seconds for the tube to get down there , but one cast to a good place is worth more than fifteen casts to a bad place . A slow fall is critical , and the tube has to be horizontal , which looks more natural than just dropping head first . " Once he 's reached the magic depth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impart a sudden movement of the tube . Usually , that does the trick . 4 . Hit ' Em High and Low Larry Nixon is another of professional bass fishing 's top all-time money earners , with more than $2 million to his credit in the B.A.S.S . and FLW circuits . As contradictory as they seem , two of Nixon 's favorite fall patterns involve fishing for bass on the surface and fishing smack-dab on the bottom . " I look for fish that are either near the bottom on structure or at the surface , usually around wood cover or some kind of vegetation , " Nixon says . " If I see a surface commotion , I 'll throw a chugger or a propbait like a Rapala Skitter Prop ( silver with black back or , for smallmouths , fire-shad ) . If there 's nothing going on at the surface , I look in deeper water for underwater channels and ditches . Then I fish with Hopkins jigging spoons or tailspinners like the Mann 's Little George or the Rinky Dink . " According to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . Nixon uses " walking " baits like Rapala Skitter Walks , Heddon Zara Spooks and Sammy Lures when fishing still water . " Although fishermen generally think of a topwater bait as being a lure strictly for shallow-water situations , in clear water you can pull bass that are near the bottom or suspended in deeper water with surface lures , " says Nixon , who makes long casts with a 7-foot medium-heavy bait-casting rod and 14-pound-test Trilene XT . A good sonar is the key to Nixon 's deepwater approach . Like Dance , he idles around a cove or creek arm until he finds a channel . Then he follows it , watching the screen for signs of bass . His favored equipment for this job is a 6 1/2-foot rod and a reel loaded with 20-pound-test XT . " It 's absolutely essential that you watch your sonar when you 're looking for shad and bass , " he says . " Contours are my targetsany changing structure features that attract baitfish . It might be a drop-off or a sharp bend in the old creek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it or nearby . " 5 . Bulge the Surface With a Spinnerbait Jimmy Houston is a former professional bass fisherman whose happy-go-lucky personality has won millions of fans to his syndicated television show . Houston 's favorite strategy is to " bulge " a gold-bladed Terminator spinnerbait near the surface of the water so that the top blade makes a wake . The idea is to mimic the vibration of a single shad racing for safety . The size of the spinnerbait Houston chooses for the jobanywhere from 1/4- to 1/2-ounceapproximates the size of the shad present . Houston 's go-to color for largemouths is white or a mixture of white , chartreuse and blue , but he likes louder colors such as bubblegum or chartreuse and white for smallmouths . He seldom uses a trailer and prefers a bait-casting rig with 14-pound-test Trilene XT dyed with a low-visibility green color . " I like a six-and-a-half-foot medium-heavy rod because it casts well and it helps me keep the spinnerbait up in the water , " adds the Oklahoma fisherman . " The really important thing is to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible . You need to put the bait in the hard-to-reach places along the bank where the bass are , and sometimes you 're aiming at a mighty small bull's-eye . " Illustration <p>
