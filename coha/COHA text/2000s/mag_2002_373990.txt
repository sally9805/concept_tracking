After Carla met Nancy in the elevator of their New York City apartment building two years ago , she was thrilled to have found a bona fide girlfriend , as well as a " mom " friend . Not only could they organize playdates for their 4-year-old daughters , but the two women could also talk about everything from the local downtown art scene to thorny in-law situations . <P> There was , however , one area in which they disagreed : how to raise kids . Carla ( who , like the other women interviewed for this article , did n't want her real name or that of her friend used ) watched with alarm as Nancy allowed her daughter to eat fistfuls of sugary snacks and scramble on playground equipment beyond her abilities . To make matters worse , Carla 's daughter was beginning to mimic those behaviors . " I did n't know whether to offer my advice or keep my mouth shut , " says Carla . She tried to be host of most of the playdates so that she could enforce her rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so uncomfortable with Nancy as a parent that the friendship basically ended . " <P> Relationship experts say one mark of being an adult is the ability to respect the fact that people do things differently . But that 's easier said than done when even the best of friends have conflicting approaches to raising children . Take , for example , the case of Elizabeth and Tracy , who met in graduate school in Chicago several years before either became a mother . " We were opinionated , we were feminists , and we always had a lot to talk about , " says Elizabeth . When they later became pregnant around the same time , they happily shared books on parenting , agreeing that they both liked the " attachment " approach , a philosophy that promotes families sleeping together wolf-pack style and babies nursing on demand and being carried in slings . <P> When Elizabeth 's son arrived and favored his crib , bottle feeding and a bouncy chair , Tracy made subtly disparaging comments about her friend 's abandonment of the attachment techniques . At the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby in the sling even when the child was wriggling to get down and nursing her when she did n't seem hungry ; in her view Tracy was responding not so much to the infant 's needs but rather to her own insecurities . The situation finally peaked when Elizabeth mentioned that she had brought her son into her bed while he was sick , and Tracy responded , " Well , I 'm so glad to see that you 're finally meeting your child 's needs . " Says Elizabeth : " I was stunned . " And hurt . Now a year later , the old friends rarely talk , and when they do , their conversations are formal . " We disagreed about lots of things before we had babies , but we always valued each other 's opinions , " says Elizabeth . " Now our disagreements feel raw in a way they never did before . " <P> Why should a friend 's parenting style be more difficult to accept than , say , her politics ?

" We live in a society in which mothers are so blamed in general that they become judgmental of mothers who parent differently , " says Harriet Lerner , Ph.D. , a psychologist and the author of The Dance of Anger : A Woman 's Guide to Changing the Patterns of Intimate Relationships ( HarperCollins ) .
