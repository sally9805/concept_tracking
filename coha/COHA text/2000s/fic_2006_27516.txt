1 The first thing I can remember clearly is writing the way into the secret room . I am so small I have to reach my arm up to make the signs in the right place on the wall of the corridor . The wall is coated with thick grey plaster , cracked and crumbling in places so the stone shows through . It 's almost dark in the corridor . It smells of earth and age , and it 's silent . But I 'm not afraid ; I 'm never afraid there . I reach up and move my writing finger in the motions I know , in the right place , in the air , not quite touching the surface of the plaster . The door opens in the wall , and I go in . The light in that room is clear and calm , falling from many small skylights of thick glass in the high ceiling . It 's a very long room , with shelves down its wall , and books on the shelves . It 's my room , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't . They do n't even know it 's there . They never come to these corridors far in the back of the house . I pass the Waylord 's door to come here , but he 's sick and lame and stays in his rooms . The secret room is my secret , the place where I can be alone , and not scolded and bothered , and not afraid . The memory is n't of one time I went there , but many . I remember how big the reading table looked to me then , and how high the bookshelves were . I liked to getunder the table and build a kind of wall or shelter with some of the books . I pretended to be a bear cub in its den . I felt safe there . I always put the books back exactly where they belonged on the shelves ; that was important . I stayed in the lighter part of the room , near the door that 's not a door . I did n't like the farther end , where it grows dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I called that the shadow end , and I almost always stayed away from it . But even my fear of the shadow end was part of my secret , my kingdom of solitude . And it was mine alone , until one day when I was nine . Sosta had been scolding me for some stupid thing that was n't my fault , and when I was rude back to her she called me " sheep hair , " which put me in a fury . I could n't hit her because her arms were longer and she could hold me off , so I bit her hand . Then her mother , my bymother Ista , scolded me and cuffed me . Furious , I ran to the back part of the house , to the dark corridor , and opened the door and went into the secret room . I was going to stay there till Ista and Sosta thought I 'd run away and been taken as a slave and was gone forever , and then they 'd be sorry for scolding unjustly and cuffing and calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot and full of tears and rage --  and there , in the strange clear light of that place , stood the Waylord with a book in his hands . He was startled , too . He came at me , fierce , his arm raised as if to strike . I stood like a stone . I could not breathe . He stopped short . " Memer ! How did you come here ? " He looked at the place where the door is when it 's open , but of course nothing was there but the wall . I still could n't breathe or speak . " I left it open , " he said , without believing what he said . I shook my head . Finally I was able to whisper , " I know how . " His face was shocked and amazed , but after a while it changed , and he said , " Decalo . " I nodded . My mother 's name was Decalo Galva . I want to tell of her , but I ca n't remember her . Or I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held tight , jostling , a good smell in the darkness of the bed , a rough red cloth , a voice which I ca n't hear but it 's only just out of hearing . I used to think if I could hold still and listen hard enough , I 'd hear her voice . She was a Galva by blood and by house . She was head housekeeper for Sulter Galva , Waylord of Ansul , an honorable and responsible position . In Ansul there were no serfs or slaves then ; we were citizens , householders , free people . My mother Decalo was in charge of all the people who worked in Galvamand . My bymother Ista , the cook , liked to tell us about how big the household used to be , back then , how many people Decalo had to look after . Ista herself had two kitchen assistants every day , and three helpers for the big dinners for visiting notables ; there were four housecleaners , and the handyman , and a groom and stableboy for the horses , eight horses in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were quite a few relatives and old people living in the house . Ista 's mother lived up over the kitchens , the Waylord 's mother lived in the Master 's rooms upstairs . The Waylord himself was always travelling up and down the Ansul Coast from town to town to meet with the other waylords , sometimes in the saddle , sometimes in a carriage with a retinue . There was a smithy in the west court in those days , and the driver and postboy lived on the top floor of the carriage house , always ready to go out with the Waylord on his rounds . " Oh it was all busy and abustle , " Ista says . " The old days ! The good days ! " When I ran through the silent corridors past the ruined rooms , I used to try to imagine those days , the good days . I used to pretend , when I swept the doorways , that I was making ready for guests who 'd come through them wearing fine clothes and shoes . I used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd looked clean and warm and furnished . I 'd kneel in the windowseat there to look out through the clear , small-paned window over the roofs of the city to the mountain . The name of my city and all the coast north of it , Ansul , means " Looking at Sul "  --  the great mountain , last and highest of the five peaks of Manva , the land across the straits . From the seafront and from all the western windows of the city you can see white Sul above the water , and the clouds it gathers round it as if they were its dreams . I knew the city had been called Ansul the Wise and Beautiful for its university and library , its towers and arcaded courts , its canals and arched bridges and the thousand little marble temples of the street-gods . But the Ansul of my childhood was a broken city of ruins , hunger , and fear . Ansul was a protectorate of Sundraman , but that great nation was busy fighting over its border with Loaman and kept no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and farmland , Ansul had long fought no wars . Our well-armed merchant fleet kept pirates from the south from harrying the coast , and since Sundraman enforced an alliance with us long ago , we had had no enemies by land . So when an army of Alds , the people of the deserts of Asudar , invaded us , they swept over the hills of Ansul like wildfire . Their army broke into the city and went through the streets murdering , looting , and raping . My mother Decalo , caught in the street coming from the market , was taken by soldiers and raped . Then the soldiers who had her were attacked by citizens , and in the fighting she managed to get away and get home to Galvamand. or transmitted in any form or by any means , electronic or mechanical , including photocopy , recording , or any information storage and retrieval system , without permission in writing from the publisher .
