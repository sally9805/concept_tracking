Inside the New American Home <P> To claim that lavish , glamorous homes are representative of a trend in America is elitist . These places are toys for the rich . EVAN AXELBANK Ithaca , N.Y . <P> The modern home , growing in size in proportion to one 's SUV , filled with technology for those too lazy even to open their window blinds and flooded with the mind-numbing drivel of billboard-size televisions , seems more a reflection of the external world 's chaos than an escape from it LIFESTYLE , Oct. 14 . Sadly , as you noted , this new American home is not about " family cohesion " but about " accommodating different lifestyles . " It may not be the American Dream , but I like my cozy walls , miniature television and blinds that I actually walk across the room to adjust . JENNY WISNIEWSKI Wauwatosa , Wis . <P> Everything in your article was so true ! Since Sept. 11 , people everywhere seem to be cocooning and decorating orredecorating . Custom kitchens and media-entertainment rooms are encouraging family togetherness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I see customers opting for the more opulent shags of years past . Everyone is indulging in comfort . Instead of taking extravagant vacations , it 's all about being cozy at home . JOE ZELDIN Calabasas , Calif . <P> These new homes look beautiful , but I could n't spot a single bookcase . I hope books will still be in vogue in the future . Reading on the Internet is convenient , but nothing beats having a book in hand . ELISABETH STEPHENS Castro Valley , Calif . <P> Although I found the homes in your article interesting , you may keep them . We are a family of five living in a five-room , 200-year-old log home and running a small dairy farm . We have one small television that my husband and I watch the news on , in bed , at night . Our children share one bedroom , and the entire family uses one closet . But we eat , work and play together . You will never see us sitting around a big , fancy room staring at a huge screen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By some standards we may look pathetic . But that is how the houses in your story looked to us . BECKY REITER Narvon , Pa . <P> I feel bad for the kids who grow up in luxurious homes like the ones in your story . Good luck to them as they adjust to sharing a bathroom with a bunch of people in a college dorm . As for parents who feel that they need a buffer zone from their children , maybe they should n't have kids in the first place . Americans ought to stop keeping up with the Joneses and instead own a modest home , live a debt-free lifestyle and get a dog . That 's the plan my husband and I have . LISA GIASSA Bogota , N.J. <P> Those of us in the middle and lower-middle class do not have chef 's kitchens , master suites , home theaters or bathroom spas . We less privileged Americans are lucky if we can afford a 1,000-sq. - ft. apartment , let alone a 2,000-sq. - ft. " starter home . " And we can not afford $100,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LANGSTON New York City <P> Americans now want their homes to be supersize . Are their choices being influenced by the fast-food industry ? Perhaps it 's time to downsize before we collapse under the weight of monster master bedrooms and huge mortgages . ANN DOW Thorofare , N.J.
