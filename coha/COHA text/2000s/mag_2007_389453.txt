A smart selection of marine electronics should include the new units designed to enhance the safety of your crew . EVERY EXPERIENCED BOAT OWNER carries a full complement of U.S. Coast Guard required safety gear aboard for the care and well-being of his crew . As his level of experience and knowledge grows , the typical owner will add more equipment to the mix . Here are four strategies any skipper can use to make his boat safer , and new marine electronics to help implement them . Deal with Darkness Navigating at night is stressful at best , dangerous at worst , but sooner or later , you will get caught out in the dark . No matter what the reason  --  a late departure from your home port , engine trouble along the way  --  those who regularly use and cruise their boat need an advantage to get back safely . Radar gives you a good picture of large objects and land masses above the water , but no usable information for obstructions at or below water level . To deal with these potential hazards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or thermal imaging camera . Night vision technology captures ambient light , amplifies it and displays objects illuminated on a small green screen , usually inside a handheld monocular or binocular . Thermal-imaging technology senses the heat signature ( everything has one ) of markers , pilings , nearby vessels , floating debris and people ( or schools of fish ) in the water , and then produces crisply defined , highly detailed images of them on screen . The images look like black ( cooler backgrounds ) and white ( hotter objects ) video . During this year 's Miami Boat Show , I attended an onboard demonstration of thermal imaging by FLIR Systems . The company 's new Navigator displays wide-angle images on a helm console monitor or a multifunction display equipped with a video input . FLIR 's popular and affordable fixed-view camera is now available with optional pan ( side-to-side ) or pan/tilt . Both versions include an electronic zoom and a joystick control for simple operation . An optional second joystick gives you control of the Navigator from two locations on the boat . Retail price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pan option is $7,499 and $8,999 for the full pan and tilt option . Pinpoint Your Location If you 're still using an older model VHF radio , or planning to call for help on your cell phone , you 're living in the past . The new Si-Tex DSC-900 is a full-featured marine VHF radio with built-in Digital Selective Calling ( DSC ) that offers you added safety at the push of a button . When you touch that button , the DSC-900 broadcasts a distress call with your boat 's unique Maritime Mobile Service Identity ( MMSI ) number to the Coast Guard and other DSC-equipped vessels within range of your vessel . When connected to an optional GPS unit , it also transmits the location of your vessel . The DSC-900 is waterproof to JIS-7 standards , which means it can be submerged to three feet for 30 minutes , so it will work fine in the open cockpit of your RIB , dinghy or on the console of your family runabout . It has 25 watts of transmitting power and receives all channels , including eight U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scan , memory scan and all-channel scan . The retail price is $159 . Avoid the Big Boys When you 're running at night , or in reduced visibility , the Automatic Identification System ( AIS ) signals from transmitters on commercial vessels can prevent a collision at sea . Raymarine 's new AIS250 is a " listen only " AIS receiver that uses an existing VHF antenna . The AIS250 then interfaces to Raymarine 's multifunction displays , and graphically overlays nearby targets on screen in the chartplotter and radar modes , allowing boat owners to identify and track vessels within VHF antenna range . Additionally , the AIS250 receives broadcasts from shore stations , including AIS alarm and safety-related messages from sources such as the U.S. Coast Guard . Raymarine 's AIS250 has the ability to monitor both class A and B AIS broadcasts , and has two NMEA 0183 input/output ports and a built-in multiplexer . The model should be in stores as the summer begins . The system is priced at $1,120 . Weather Watch Checking the weather before you go is a vital part of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance at The Weather Channel , or tuning in to your local weather broadcast , can give you information on regional conditions that may affect your local area weather later in the day . Northstar has just announced a new weather module that will make Sirius Marine Weather available on its powerful 6100i networked navigation system . Now boat owners with this system can harness the power of real-time , graphical weather information . The 6100i gives users access to WSI ( an industry-leading professional weather service ) and can display NOWRad weather ( rain ) and lightning strikes , high-resolution sea surface temperatures , buoy reports for current conditions , marine-zone forecasts and warnings , and more . The system can also track tropical storms , hurricanes and cyclones  --  hopefully well in advance of landfall . Coverage includes the 48 contiguous states , for those who do their boating on inland lakes and rivers , as well as international waters extending hundreds of miles into the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans , the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea . Suggested retail price for the Northstar Weather Module is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as low as $30 per month , are available from Sirius Marine Weather .
