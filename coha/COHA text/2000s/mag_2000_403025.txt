My Dad 's a Menace on the Road ! My dad 's been in two minor accidents in the past 6 months-both his fault . ( Luckily , no one was hurt . ) But he refuses to stop driving . He wo n't listen to me , so I 'd like his doctor to talk to him about it . Does this make sense ? <p> Yes , but it might be a good idea to talk to his physician first to discuss a plan . Here 's why : Imagine that during a routine doctor visit you were told that you should no longer drive . Consider the profound impact that it would have on your life . Now imagine that you are your parents ' age . Not driving can deal a terrible blow to their social lives . <p> Initially , you 'd probably react with anger at your physician . For many patients , this might mean the end of the relationship with their doctor , precisely at a time when they need him most . What 's Your Role ? <p> Determining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctor 's job ; determining whether there might be a problem and whether your dad should see a doctor in the first place falls to you . Because the stakes are so high for him , his passengers , other drivers , and pedestrians , my rule of thumb here is to err on the side of an evaluation . <p> In general , any older driver who has an accident that appears to be the result of unusually poor judgment ( such as striking a stationary vehicle or driving on the sidewalk ) needs an evaluation . Lesser transgressions such as dents and dings merit an evaluation if they are multiple . The same is true with moving violations . If , while riding with your dad , you notice erratic or odd driving ( even if an accident does n't occur ) , get him to the doctor sooner rather than later . <p> Because of the delicacy of this doctor/ patient discussion , you might want to make an appointment to talk to your dad 's doctor first , on your own . You can explain your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plan the best way to approach the problem during his appointment . Why a Doctor ? <p> I realize that your dad 's not going to be pleased about the idea of consulting his doctor . But you can make it a bit easier by explaining that the goal of the consultation is not necessarily to confiscate his license but to determine the exact cause(s) of his driving difficulties and , with any luck , fix them . Here are some of the more common problems : <p> Alzheimer 's disease or related dementia . This is easily the most common reason that geriatricians are consulted about driving . Such diseases interfere not only with memory but also with the parts of the brain that control judgment , the ability to initiate movements , and the perception of space and direction - all crucial attributes of safe driving . Some dementias ( such as those related to thyroid abnormalities , medications , or chemical imbalances ) may be partially or completely reversible and should therefore be evaluated thoroughly . <p> Some recent research suggests that patients with very mild Alzheimer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thorough evaluation . Most geriatricians ( myself included ) usually err on the side of caution , insisting that our patients with dementia not drive . Vision problems . Cataracts are a great example of a reversible cause of vision loss that can adversely affect driving . But even just needing a new eyeglass prescription can affect driving skill . Hearing loss . Safe driving requires the ability to hear well , and hearing loss is common as we get older . Chronic conditions . A variety of medical problems seen in older people , ranging from arthritis to Parkinson 's disease , can influence mobility and reaction time behind the wheel . Be sure that these are being treated optimally . If stiffness keeps your dad from looking over his shoulder easily , he may not be turning to check traffic when he pulls out . Ask his physician about range-of-motion exercises . Medications . What he 's taking can have a variety of side effects that can hinder driving ability ( including drowsiness ) . Pay attention for any changes in driving after starting a new drug . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physician 's advice is to stop driving , but he refuses to comply ? Yes , there are strong-arm tactics that will get the job done , such as taking the car keys or reporting him to the department of motor vehicles . But , unlike his physician , you have to live with your dad after he leaves the doctor 's office . I would therefore suggest an incremental approach that can be more- or less-aggressively implemented based on his acceptance . <p> First , try to get him to understand why the doctor has offered this edict . Without humiliating him , remind him of the accident(s) that led to your concern . While many patients with Alzheimer 's will deny their deficits , reasoning with him is certainly worth a try . <p> Be ready with alternatives that will allow him to keep up with appointments and social engagements . You may find that the cost of a taxi to get him to a weekly poker game is far less than the price of maintaining and insuring his car . To find out about transportation options in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 677-1116 . <p> Whatever you suggest , try to bear in mind that giving up driving can have emotional as well as practical ramifications . Be sensitive to what a big step this will be for your dad . Safety at Any Age <p> There are some driving safety issues that you can address fairly easily . Be sure that your parent observes these rules : Wear a seat belt . Can he easily reach and fasten the belt ? Arthritis and other problems can make this difficult . If he 's having trouble , suggest going with him to an automotive repair shop to have the belt adjusted . Be able to see over the steering wheel easily . If not , get a seat booster from an automotive supply store . ( Cushions from home can slip too easily . ) Keep the car in good working order , and replace tires and wiper blades as needed .
