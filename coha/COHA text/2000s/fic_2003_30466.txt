1900 He would always remember the weather that day . By nightfall , the rain that had started that morning was still whirling across the little town in New Jersey that lay on the brink of the Atlantic Ocean . You could imagine yourself , Adam thought , on a pirate ship with Long John Silver , sailing through high seas on the way to Treasure Island . Meanwhile , you were safe in the kitchen at the supper table next to the coal stove . " Have some more stew , Adam . You must be tired after helping Pa in the store all afternoon . " That was Rachel , whom Pa had married after Adam 's mother died . She was good to him , and he was fond of her , but he did wish that she would n't always be urging him to eat . Pa laughed . " Such a typical Jewish mother , stuffing the children with food . He 's not tired . He 's a strong man . In three days he 'll be thirteen , a man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you feel about that ? " Right now the only thing he felt was relief that the afternoon was over . He was finished with baskets and boxes and bags , loaded with just about everything a human being might ever want to put in his stomach : coffee , sugar , whiskey , and tea , carrots , potatoes , cookies and toffee candy ; loaded too with the things men and women wear , the breeches , corsets , fichus , neckties , aprons , and galoshes . One thing was sure , though ; one thing he knew . He was not going to follow his father and work in the store when he grew up . Maybe one of the other boys would be willing , but not he . They were odd little brothers -- half brothers -- different from him , and so different from each other that Adam had to wonder what makes people who theyare . What makes Jonathan , at four , so bright and happy that Adam really does n't mind having to watch over him occasionally ? What made Leo , at nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temper tantrums that sometimes make you wish a stranger would come along and adopt him ? Still , you have to feel sorry for him , poor kid . With a face shaped like an egg , a long curve at the top where the forehead seems to bulge , and almost no chin at the bottom . He 's too short and too fat . He always stands alone in the schoolyard . His only friend is Bobby Nishikawa , whose family owns the Japanese restaurant called Fugi on Main Street . Leo 's too shy , too smart , and too clumsy . I 've tried and tried to show him how to play ball , Adam thought , but I 've given up . He only gets angry at me . All of a sudden , Leo interrupted his thoughts . " Adam 's a bastard ! Did you all know Adam 's a bastard ? " Rachel 's and Pa 's coffee cups clattered onto their saucers . " What ? " Rachel exclaimed . " What in heaven 's name are you saying , Leo ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people do n't talk like that . " " Yes , they do . I heard them . " Leo , now the center of attention , hurried along with his story . " They said it at the basketball game in the gym . Those two men behind me said it . When Adam put the ball in the basket and won the game , one said , ' It 's too bad he 's a bastard , a smart , good-looking boy like that . ' I heard him , Pa . " " Ridiculous ! He ought to be ashamed of himself , whoever he is . " Was I seven in second grade , or maybe only six in first grade , when a big fifth-grader told one of her friends that Adam Arnring was a bastard ? The way the word was spoken , and the laughing expression on her face told him that it was a shameful thing she was calling him -- shameful like throwing up in the schoolyard , as he had done one day . " I 'm not ! " he had protested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother . I heard her . " " Absolutely not , " Pa had said . " That 's nonsense . Do n't even think about it . " So he had not thought about it . How was it , though , that he so clearly remembered it now ? " You 're going to be punished , " Rachel said sternly , " if you ever use that word again , Leo . " " I do n't care . " " You 'll listen to me , or you 'll care very much . Now be a good boy and give these scraps to Arthur for his dinner . " Hearing his name , the old dog , a sturdy mixture of collie mother and unknown father , raised his head as if to ask a question with his mild brown eyes . " I 'll do it , " Adam said promptly . For no reason that he could explain , there came a rush of tenderness for this dependent creature who trusted them to care for him and never to hurt him . And setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . As if nothing at all had happened at the supper table a moment before , Pa reminded him that it was Saturday . " I 've put the washtub in the pantry , and I 'm sure that kettle on the stove is already hot enough so you can have your bath , Adam . " " Not tonight , Pa . I 'm more tired than I thought I was . I 'm going up to bed . " Neither Rachel nor Pa said anything . Did they not wonder why he was going upstairs so early ? Oh , they know there is something terribly wrong ! In the attic , where the peaked roof was so slanted that one could only stand upright in the center of the room , Adam took off his shirt and pants , lit the oil lamp , lay down with his book , and did not read . Rain drummed on the single window . The room was chilly , and covered as he was with his flannel underwear and the heavy quilt , he felt not merely cold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had never thought much about his mother . She was dead , that was all . People died . She died in a diphtheria epidemic when he was three weeks old . Once in a while , a very long while , he looked at photographs of people he had never known and never would know : Pa 's parents standing in front of a small wooden house in a country on the other side of the ocean ; Pa and a young woman standing in front of a stone wall , she very small and slender beneath an enormous feathered hat . Illegitimate . Bastard . Can those two people have done what he is now thinking about ? When a person has reached thirteen , he is a man and he has learned a few things . A lot of his friends have older brothers who hire a buckboard on Saturday night to take them five miles out on the road to Gracie 's house , Gracie being a fat old lady who lives with ten or twelve young ladies . And there the brothers " do things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go there . He understands . But what husbands do with their wives is very different . They have babies because they are married . If they have babies without being married , it is like stealing . To have a bastard is a shameful thing , like walking out of Pa 's store with a package hidden under your coat , without paying for it . You could never imagine Pa stealing anything . Pa would n't lie to him . Those girls in school and those men in the gym -- they might lie , but Pa never would . Here he was now coming up the stairs , his heavy tread making the old steps creak . When he walked in , he sat down at the foot of the bed , as if this was something he did every night instead of for the first time . " Reading again , my Adam ? What book is it now ? " " The Last of the Mohicans . It 's about Indians . " " There still were a few Indians in Georgia when I first came to America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , poor people . Have I ever told you about them ? " Adam could have said that he knew the whole story almost by heart . He knew about the trip north because the South was so poor after the Civil War ; he knew the tale of Whitey the horse and the wagon Pa had bought as soon as he had saved a few dollars ; he knew about the arrival here in town and the opening of Simon Arnring 's first little store . But he only nodded his head now , and waited . " Nineteen hundred . Everything 's going to be different . I do n't know how , but it will be . That 's what they say . After a while , I suppose I 'll have to put in a telephone , wo n't I ? They say that the price will be coming down pretty soon . If it does n't , we 'll just do without . Pennies make dollars . The world 's been getting along pretty well all these years without this new stuff , autos and telephones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars . " Pa was frugal , but never stingy . Simon Arnring was known to be charitable beyond his means , and lenient with his poorest customers . Adam was aware of all that ; he was also aware that Pa had not climbed upstairs to talk about either the Civil War in Georgia or the new century , so he nodded and waited again . Pa had a way of talking in jerks . People said he was a man of few words , which was true , except for the rare mood when words would suddenly start to roll from his tongue . . . and then , just as suddenly , stop . " I think I hear Arthur struggling on the stairs . He can hardly pull himself up . At his age --  " Pa stared at the floor . There came a silence , vaguely sad and thick as a substance you might feel with your fingers . The silence lasted long enough for Arthur to come in , stretch out , and settle into his usual doze . Pa coughed and cleared his throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put on a bright expression and began afresh . " I 've never told you , never told you or anybody , that you would n't have been born if not for Arthur , have I ? " Adam thought : If he 's come up here to amuse me with a dog story , I do n't want to hear it . He should know better . " It 's a fairly long story . I can tell you if you want to hear it . " And hearing the scorn in his own voice , Adam repeated , " If it were n't for the dog , I would n't have been born ? I do n't understand . So I think I ought to hear it . " " Well , then . On the very last day before I opened my store here , I had to deliver something at a farm . It was spring , and terribly hot for the season . The horse was tired , so I walked him slowly . That 's how I came to see this terrible thing alongside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The pups , five or six of them , each hardly bigger than a mouse , were lying half dead beside the poor mother . She was too weak to move , panting there in the broiling sun , with her tongue hanging out . Some rotter who did n't deserve to live had dropped her off in the woods . God knows how long she had been there , all night maybe . So I picked her up and put her , with the pups , in the wagon , getting myself filthy , but I could n't leave the poor creature like that . At the next farm I stopped and asked for water to cool them . And a young girl came out to help me . Eileen , she was . Eileen Murphy . " All this Adam already knew . Eileen was his mother . He knew about his birth in the room above the store , about the diphtheria epidemic . A sad story , too sad to tell again . " I brought the pups and the mother back home with me and named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day . Queen , I think , must have been pretty old , because she only lived another year . At least she spent it in a good home . " Pa smiled , not out toward Adam , but inwardly , to himself . A secret smile , the kind people have when they are remembering something that nobody else knows . " Eileen came to the store with a baby bottle of milk in case Queen might not have enough for Arthur . She 's the one who gave him his name . Chester Alan Arthur was one of our presidents . She was patriotic . " He stopped . " I have to collect my thoughts . It seems so long ago now . I had never met anyone like her . So delicate , so gentle , she was . She loved flowers , loved to arrange them . On the Fourth of July she put red , white , and blue bouquets in my windows . A gentle soul , too trusting . . . I do n't know . Her father was a laborer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I guess , but not hard enough to keep him away from the saloons . He was tough , no good at all . I used to wonder how he ever had a daughter like her . I never found out , never knew much about her people , only that she was the youngest , the last one at home . " And again there came that secret smile , so sad and secret that Adam , for all his own confusion of anger , curiosity , and distress , still felt a kind of pity . " We became friends . Sometimes when the store was n't busy , we 'd have a cup of coffee together . She had never been anywhere or read anything about other places . So I told her about where I came from in Europe , and about the tiny village where we all spoke German . She began to come more often . She used to tell her father that she would meet some friends at the soda fountain in the drugstore , while he was at the saloon , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open most evenings and was probably a livelier place than the lone farm . What else besides the dog could the attraction be ? I was a man almost thirty , and she was a girl of eighteen . " Something Adam feared to hear and yet needed to hear was coming . He waited . " She seemed like such a child , not much older than you are now . Well , five years . But then , you have always been a whole lot older than your years . " Now it was coming , the thing Pa really wanted to tell him . At the same time , he seemed uncertain about whether he ought to tell it . " One evening when she was there , her father came raging into the store . His rage was out of control . He called his daughter a dirty name . He threatened me with his fist . I tried to protect Eileen and managed fairly well , although he did land one blow on her cheek before I was able to shove him out onto the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . She was a proper young lady , and he had shamed her before all of the people in the store . Well , I did what anyone would do to comfort her . I washed her face and put some salve on the bruise . I gave her my bed upstairs and put a cot in the hall for myself . Her father came again the next day as I had suspected he would , but she stayed upstairs out of sight . I had a few friends in the police force , and I guess they had plenty to say to him , because after a few days he stopped coming . I heard that the farm where he worked had been sold , and he was no longer needed . So the next thing I heard was that he had left town and perhaps left the state , God knows where to . . .
