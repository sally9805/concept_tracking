George Plimpton was up , angry . Doing work . George was a badass . George was a head smasher . And though some tried , George Plimpton was not to be trifled with . George 's belligerence was necessitated , this time , by a weepy-bitchy scream in the night , shrill enough to be heard above the steel wheels rolling across the joins of the rails and the diesel-electric GE Unit some fifteen cars up hauling us eastward across the Ameri- can Middle West . The scream was weepy-bitchy shrill enough you 'd almost think it was a woman doing the " please , oh God " - ing . Almost . Not quite . Not quite weepy-bitchy shrill enough for that . It carried just enough bass to be the cries of what passed for a man ; the cries of Yuppie Scum . Some day-trading , dot-com-ing bastard who was bored with his Benz and instant millions and figuredfor whatever reason logical only to Young , Upwardly Mobile Scurfthat hopping Old Dirty Face , riding the rails , would be a romantic , nostalgic way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canned beans with some white bearded hobo who regaled with recountings of endless travel over wide-open spaces . Yeah . The screams were most likely courtesy of a romantic dick to his ass . Maybe the product of an old-fashioned shank to his ribs . Fine . Not my problem . Yuppie Scum 's in the wrong place , Yuppie Scum gets what it deserves . I was just trying to make Iowa . Except All that weepy-bitchy screaming . . . it 's just got a way of edging you up . Others , the other tramps and ' boes in the carcatch-outs to Iowa were always heavy the second weekend in Augustkept to themselves . Others weresmarter than me . I made for the commotion . A full moon cutting through slits in the metal of the box- car helped me read the situation . Fetaled up in a corner of the car was a floppy blond-haired white guy still " oh , Jesus . Oh God , please , God do n't " - ing . He was sporting Dockersactual honest-to-Christ Dockersand a shirt that had previously been another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowed from cuts and slashes , defensive wounds , decorating his arms and upper body . Standing over him were a couple of ' boes . Black bandannas on their necks . Could still smell the piss . Fuck . Not ' boes . Freight Train Riders of America . FTRA . Meth-snorting peckerwood gangers . One was demonstrating a blade , the other the smile of a patron enjoying a show . To the both of them : " Knock that shit off . " Real-life violence is not like movie violence . Movie violence is most times preceded by lots of snappy dialogue from $20 million action star #14 concerning how he 's going to do some nasty things to the stuntman who 's paid union wages to go down on cue . Real-life violence is mostly unescorted by tough-guy remarks about driving somebody 's nose bone up into their brain . In real life , violence is just very suddenly with you . Suddenly the FTRA with the blade was slashing for me . And it was then that George Plimpton got up , angry . Did work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined . The wrist , technically speaking . George greeted the FTRA at the wrist , and the FTRA 's wrist replied with a squeal and a deafening snap and a fountain of blood from where flesh got torn open by breaking bone . George swung around , catching FTRA in the face , across his cheek . What teeth were n't smashed from his mouth were driven through the skin of his jaw . FTRA One was done for the day . FTRA Two , who 'd come to the party without shank or sharp object or goonie stick , gave me and George some fearful looking- over . I said to him : " Got money ? " The FTRA 's headpoked like he 'd tried to block buckshot with it . Brittle skin peppered with a beard that would n't grow rightshook his head no . " Got food stamps ? " The head with its shitty excuse for a face gave me " no " again . My eyes shifted away from the FTRA . In a flinchy style he looked to where I was looking : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken , but my meaning was clear . FTRA number two started in with some begging . " Please . . . " One pitiful word , but at least he did n't sound the bitch Dockers Boy did . Did n't matter . " Get out . " " Plea " George raised up . That was it for FTRA Two . He 'd seen George Plimpton doing work . George Plimpton was not to be trifled with . Using what was left of his free will , FTRA Two sailed himself into the dark that waited just beyond the door . The boxcar now de-FTRA 'd , my attention was pulled by the sick whimpers of the yuppie scum . " Ththank you . " Those goddamn Dockers . And I 'm pretty sure his shirt was Banana Republic . " Got money ? " I wanted to know . On the floor of the boxcar , Yuppie Scum was just a little ball of confusion . " . . . Wha . . . ? " " Got money ? " " . . . No . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't . " He was lying . Not about the food stamps . Yuppie Scum did n't know a WIC coupon from a welfare check . But money . . . Those FTRA fuckers had n't had time to roll him properly . They had n't had time to get to his wallet ; his cash or his traveler 's checks . Yeah . Believe it . Goddamn Yuppie Scum caught out with traveler 's checks . And this one had to go and pretend like . . . I save his less-than-useless pink hide , and he does n't have the decency to compensate me ? I grabbed at Yuppie Scum , grabbed his wallet , pulled it free , taking a swath of Dockers with it . Gripping his bloody-moist BR shirt , I hauled him for the boxcar door . Knowing what was coming , he went spasticflailing , clawing at me . All that gift-wrapped in more of his girlie yells . He 'd made his choice . He 'd picked lying over truth-telling . Could n't he just take what was coming ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Out the door with Yuppie Scum . Into the night , into the howling air that swept past the rushing train . If not for the noise of the Unit , the constant chatter of the couplings , it would have been quiet enough in the city-free nothingland west of Iowa to hear the coo of tall weeds petted by the night breeze , the hum of crickets and power lines as they sang at each other . It would have been quiet enough to hear if Yuppie Scum bitch-screamed as he flew groundward , if his neck cracked when he hit terra firma from a train doing sixty-plus , or if he just smacked earth , picked himself up , and hollered " To hell with you , you nigger tramp ! " as he dusted his Dockers off . Not knowing which was true , I imagined my reality of favor . I imagined Yuppie Scum 's neck to be shattered beyond repair . Not killing him . Leaving him a quad for life . And I was happy for it . Yuppie Scum reproduced at a rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be replaced . He would not be missed . I know . I had been Yuppie Scum . I had been replaced in the world . No one missed me . With George I returned to my corner of the boxcar , the other tramps and ' boes not even daring to look our way . I went through Yuppie Scum 's wallet . Shit . No money . He was n't lying . Anyway . I was jangled and I needed some of Lady K to set me straight . Needed her , just wanted her . Did n't matter . I had some of her . Calmed down , George and I curled up together . I did not sleep . As always , I was scared to death of what waited for me just the other side of being awake .
