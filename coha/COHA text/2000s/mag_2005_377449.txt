Michael Jackson 's trial began last week with testimony from the accuser 's sister and others , who launched the prosecution 's case that Jackson molested a 13-year-old boy at his Neverland Ranch . And courtroom watchers got their first good look at the legal teams that are set to clash . <P> Lead prosecutor Tom ( Mad Dog ) Sneddon , for 22 years district attorney of California 's Santa Barbara County , tried to take command of the case early , with forceful but empathic questioning . Legal analysts have scoffed that he is a relative bumpkin next to the slicker , more experienced defense team , but this deeply religious father of nine has a near perfect legal record . And Sneddon knows how to talk to the jury , which may be more comfortable with his small-town style . <P> Jackson 's lead attorney is a big name from Los Angeles , Thomas Mesereau . His sharp cross- examination at times irritated the judge but often landed . He got the accuser 's sister to backtrack on key testimony , and turned another witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a voice for the defense . <P> Mesereau has three other attorneys on his team , plus an intriguing new adviser  --  Gary Dunlap , a lawyer from nearby Lompoc who has reasons for going up against Sneddon . In 2003 , Sneddon brought charges against Dunlap for witness intimidation . Sneddon lost , and Dunlap filed a $10 million wrongful-prosecution suit , still pending . If Mesereau was looking for a way to counter Sneddon 's home-court advantage , he may have found it .  --  By Unmesh Kher and Matt Kettmann
