MARCH 22 , 2001 PANDORA , COLORADO The waning stars in the early-morning sky blazed like a theater marquee when seen from 9,000 feet above sea level . But it was the moon that had a ghostly look about it as Luis Marquez stepped from his little wooden frame house . It wore a curious orange halo that he had never seen before . He peered at the odd phenomenon for a few moments before walking across the yard to his 1973 Chevy Cheyenne 4x4 pickup truck . He had dressed in his work clothes and slipped quietly out of the house so as not to wake his wife and two daughters . His wife , Lisa , would have gladly gotten up and fixed breakfast and a sandwich for his lunch pail , but he insisted that 4:00 A.M. was too early for anyone but a mental case to be roaming around in the dark . Marquez and his family lived simply . With his own hands , he had remodeled the house that had been built in 1882 . His children went to school in nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the booming resort ski town , they brought home during monthly shopping trips to the larger ranch community of Montrose , sixty-seven miles to the north . His routine was never complete until he lingered over his coffee and stared around what was now a ghost town . Under the spectral light from the moon , the few buildings that still stood looked like tombstones in a cemetery . Following the discovery of gold-bearing rock in 1874 , miners poured into the San Miguel Valley and built a town they called Pandora , after the Greek fairytale about a beautiful girl and her box full of mysterious spirits . A banking interest in Boston bought up the mining claims , financed the mine 's operation , and constructed a large ore-processing plant only two miles above the more famous mining town of Telluride . They 'd called the mine the Paradise , and soon Pandora became a small company town of two hundred citizens with its own post office . The houses were neatly painted , with mowed green lawns and white fences , and although Pandora was set in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was not isolated . The road to Telluride was well maintained , and the Rio Grande Southern Railroad ran a spur line into town to haul passengers and supplies to the mine and the processed ore across the Continental Divide to Denver . There were those who swore the mine was cursed . The human cost of extracting fifty million dollars ' worth of gold over forty years was high . A total of twenty-eight hard-rock miners had died inside the damp and forbidding shaftsfourteen in one disaster alonewhile close to a hundred were maimed for life because of freak accidents and cave-ins . Before the old-timers who had moved down the road and resided in Telluride died off , they 'd claimed that the ghost of one of the dead miners could be heard moaning throughout the ten miles of empty shafts that honeycombed the steep , ominous gray cliffs that rose nearly 13,000 feet into the lazy blue skies of Colorado . By 1931 , all the gold that could be profitably processed from the ore with the aid of chemicals was exhausted . Played out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty-five years , it became only a memory and a slowly healing scar on the panoramic landscape . Not until 1996 had its haunted shafts and tunnels heard the tread of boots and the clang of a pickax again . Marquez shifted his stare onto the mountain peaks . A four-day storm had come and gone the week before , adding four feet of snow to the already packed slopes . The increasing air temperatures that accompanied the spring turned the snow into the consistency of mushy mashed potatoes . It was the prime avalanche season . Conditions were extremely hazardous in the high country , and skiers were warned not to wander from the established ski runs . As far as Marquez knew , no major snowslide had ever struck the town of Pandora . He was secure in knowing his family was safe , but he ignored the risk to himself every time he made the drive up the steep icy road in winter and worked alone deep in the bowels of the mountain . With the coming of warm days , a snow slide was an event waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his years on the mountain . The sheer magnitude of its beauty and power as it swept rocks , trees , and snow down a valley in great clouds , along with the rumbling sound of thunder , was something he had never forgotten . Finally , he set his hard hat on his head , slipped behind the wheel of the Chevy pickup , and started the engine , letting it idle for a couple of minutes to warm . Then he began cautiously driving up the narrow , unpaved road that led to the mine that once was the leading gold producer in the state of Colorado . His tires had made deep ruts in the snow after the last storm . He drove carefully as the road wound higher up the mountain . Very quickly , the drop-off along the edge stretched several hundred feet to the base . One uncontrolled skid and rescuers would be untangling Marquez 's broken body from his mangled pickup truck on the rocks far below . Local people thought him foolish for buying up the claims to the old Paradise Mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , except for a Telluride banker , no one would have dreamed that Marquez 's investment had made him a rich man . His profits from the mine were shrewdly invested in local real estate , and with the boom of the ski resort he had realized nearly two million dollars . Marquez was not interested in gold . For ten years , he had prospected around the world for gemstones . In Montana , Nevada , and Colorado , he had prowled the old abandoned gold and silver mines searching for mineral crystals that could be cut into precious gems . Inside one tunnel of the Paradise Mine , he discovered a vein of rose-pink crystals in what the old miners had considered worthless rock . The gemstone in its natural state , Marquez recognized , was rhodochrosite , a spectacular crystal found in various parts of the world in shades of pink and deep red . Rhodochrosite is seldom seen in cut or faceted form . Large crystals are in great demand by collectors , who have no desire to see them sliced to pieces . Clean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into flawless stones of eighteen carats were very expensive . Marquez knew he could retire and spend the rest of his life in style , but as long as the vein continued , he was determined to keep picking the stones from the granite until they petered out . He stopped his battered old truck with its scratched and dented fenders and stepped out in front of a huge rusty iron door with four different chains attached to four different locks . Inserting keys the size of a man 's palm , he unsnapped the locks and spread the chains . Then he took both hands and tugged the great door open . The moon 's rays penetrated a short distance down a sloping mine shaft and revealed a pair of rails that stretched off into the darkness . He fired up the engine mounted on a large portable generator , then pulled a lever on a junction box . The mine shaft was suddenly illuminated under a series of exposed lightbulbs that trailed down the shaft for a hundred yards before gradually growing smaller , until they became tiny glimmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rail tracks , attached to a cable that led to a winch . The cart was built to last , and the only sign of hard use was the rust on the sides of the bucket . Marquez climbed into the bucket and pressed a button on a remote control . The winch began to hum and play out the cable , allowing the ore cart to roll down the rails , propelled by nothing more than gravity . Going underground was not for the fainthearted or the claustrophobic . The confining shaft barely allowed clearance for the ore bucket . Timbers bolted together like door frames , known as a cap and post , were spaced every few feet to shore up the roof against cave-ins . Many of the timbers had rotted badly , but others were as solid and sound as the day they were set in place by miners who had long since passed on . The ore car descended the sloping shaft at a rapid rate , coming to a stop 1,200 feet into the depths . At this level there was a constant trickle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a backpack and his lunch pail , Marquez climbed from the car and walked over to a vertical shaft that fell away into the lower reaches of the old Paradise Mine until it reached the 2,200-foot level . Down there , the main drift and crosscut tunnels spread into the granite like spokes on a wheel . According to old records and underground maps , there were almost a hundred miles of tunnels under and around Pandora . Marquez dropped a rock into the yawning blackness . The sound of a splash came within two seconds . Soon after the mine closed down and the pumps at the pumping station below the base of the mountain were turned off , the lower levels had flooded . Over time , water had risen to within fifteen feet of the 1,200-foot level , where Marquez worked the rhodochrosite vein . The slowly rising water , spurred on during a particularly heavy wet season in the San Juans , told him that it would be only a matter of a few weeks before it reached the top of the old shaft and spilled over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gemstone-mining operation . Marquez set his mind on extracting as many stones as he could in the brief time he had left . His days became longer as he struggled to remove the red crystals with nothing but his miner 's pick and a wheelbarrow to carry the ore to the bucket for the ride up to the mine 's entrance . As he walked through the tunnel , he stepped around old rusting ore cars and drills left by the miners when they had deserted the mine . There had been no market for the equipment , since nearby mines were closing down one by one at the same time . It was all simply cast aside and left where it was last used . Seventy-five yards into the tunnel , he came to a narrow cleft in the rock just wide enough for him to slip through . Twenty feet beyond was the rhodochrosite lode he was mining . A lightbulb had burned out on the string hanging from the roof of the cleft , and he replaced it with one of several he kept in a backpack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack the rock that was embedded with the gemstones . A dull red in their natural state , the crystals looked like dried cherries in a muffin . A dangerous overhang of rock protruded just above the cleft . If he was to continue to work safely without being crushed by a rockfall , Marquez had no choice but to blast it away . Using a portable pneumatic drill , he bored a hole into the rock . Then he inserted a small charge of dynamite and wired it to a handheld detonator . After moving around the corner of the cleft and into the main tunnel , he pushed down on the plunger . A dull thump echoed through the mine , followed by the sound of tumbling rock and a blanket of dust that rolled into the main tunnel . Marquez waited a few minutes for the dust to settle before carefully entering the natural cleft . The overhang was gone . It had become a pile of rocks on the narrow floor . He retrieved the wheelbarrow and began removing the debris , dumping it a short distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he looked up to make certain that no threatening section of the overhang remained . He stared in wonder at a hole that had suddenly appeared in the roof above the crystal lode . He aimed the light atop his hard hat upward . The beam continued through the hole into what appeared to be a chamber beyond . Suddenly consumed by curiosity , he ran back up the tunnel for fifty yards , where he found the rusty remains of a six-foot iron ladder among the abandoned mining equipment . Returning inside the cleft , he propped up the ladder , climbed the rungs , and pried loose several rocks from the rim of the hole , widening it until he could squeeze through . Then he thrust his upper torso inside the chamber and twisted his head from shoulder to shoulder , sweeping the beam of his hard hat 's light around the darkness . Marquez found himself staring into a room hewn in the rock . It looked to be a perfect cube approximately fifteen by fifteen feet , with the same distance separating the floor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smooth walls . This definitely was not the work of nineteenth-century miners . Then , abruptly , the beam of his hard hat 's light struck a stone pedestal and glinted on the object it supported . Marquez froze in shock at the ungodly sight of a black skull , its empty eye sockets staring directly at him .
