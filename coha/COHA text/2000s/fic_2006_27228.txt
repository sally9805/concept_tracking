Liaison . The Warmth of Family . Stormy Weather . The evening his master died he worked again well after he ended the day for the other adults , his own wife among them , and sent them back with hunger and tiredness to their cabins . The young ones , his son among them , had been sent out of the fields an hour or so before the adults , to prepare the late supper and , if there was time enough , to play in the few minutes of sun that were left . When he , Moses , finally freed himself of the ancient and brittle harness that connected him to the oldest mule his master owned , all that was left of the sun was a five-inch-long memory of red orange laid out in still waves across the horizon between two mountains on the left and one on the right . He had been in the fields for all of fourteen hours . He paused before leaving the fields as the evening quiet wrapped itself about him . The mule quivered , wanting home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took a pinch of the soil and ate it with no more thought than if it were a spot of cornbread . He worked the dirt around in his mouth and swallowed , leaning his head back and opening his eyes in time to see the strip of sun fade to dark blue and then to nothing . He was the only man in the realm , slave or free , whoate dirt , but while the bondage women , particularly the pregnant ones , ate it for some incomprehensible need , for that something that ash cakes and apples and fatback did not give their bodies , he ate it not only to discover the strengths and weaknesses of the field , but because the eating of it tied him to the only thing in his small world that meant almost as much as his own life . This was July , and July dirt tasted even more like sweetened metal than the dirt of June or May . Something in the growing crops unleashed a metallic life that only began to dissipate in mid-August , and by harvest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sour moldiness he associated with the coming of fall and winter , the end of a relationship he had begun with the first taste of dirt back in March , before the first hard spring rain . Now , with the sun gone and no moon and the darkness having taken a nice hold of him , he walked to the end of the row , holding the mule by the tail . In the clearing he dropped the tail and moved around the mule toward the barn . The mule followed him , and after he had prepared the animal for the night and came out , Moses smelled the coming of rain . He breathed deeply , feeling it surge through him . Believing he was alone , he smiled . He knelt down to be closer to the earth and breathed deeply some more . Finally , when the effect began to dwindle , he stood and turned away , for the third time that week , from the path that led to the narrow lane of the quarters with its people and his own cabin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now not to wait for him to come and eat with them . On a night with the moon he could see some of the smoke rising from the world that was the lane - home and food and rest and what passed in many cabins for the life of family . He turned his head slightly to the right and made out what he thought was the sound of playing children , but when he turned his head back , he could hear far more clearly the last bird of the day as it evening-chirped in the small forest far off to the left . He went straight ahead , to the farthest edge of the cornfields to a patch of woods that had yielded nothing of value since the day his master bought it from a white man who had gone broke and returned to Ireland . " I did well over there , " that man lied to his people back in Ireland , his dying wife standing hunched over beside him , " but I longed for all of you and for the wealth of my homeland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three acres did yield some soft , blue grass that no animal would touch and many trees that no one could identify . Just before Moses stepped into the woods , the rain began , and as he walked on the rain became heavier . Well into the forest the rain came in torrents through the trees and the mighty summer leaves and after a bit Moses stopped and held out his hands and collected water that he washed over his face . Then he undressed down to his nakedness and lay down . To keep the rain out of his nose , he rolled up his shirt and placed it under his head so that it tilted just enough for the rain to flow down about his face . When he was an old man and rheumatism chained up his body , he would look back and blame the chains on evenings such as these , and on nights when he lost himself completely and fell asleep and did n't come to until morning , covered with dew . The ground was almost soaked . The leaves seemed to soften @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body and face with no more power than the gentle tapping of fingers . He opened his mouth ; it was rare for him and the rain to meet up like this . His eyes had remained open , and after taking in all that he could without turning his head , he took up his thing and did it . When he was done , after a few strokes , he closed his eyes , turned on his side and dozed . After a half hour or so the rain stopped abruptly ... ( Continues ... )
