AFTER HAVING HER BABY , SHE FELL APART . HOW THE STAR STRUGGLED WITH DEPRESSION AND LEARNED TO LOVE LIFE AS A MOM . PLUS : AN EXCLUSIVE LOOK AT HER NEW BOOK . // Walking into a cozy Manhattan caf , Brooke Shields pulls off a huge hooded coat to reveal a dramatic new look . Wearing absolutely no makeup , she nonetheless is striking-particularly because it appears that she has recently been struck . A large bruise , swollen and dark , covers the right side of her face . But there is no assailant to blame . After more than 30 years in show business-and a career that has taken her from teenage vamp to sitcom sweetheart to stage star-Brooke Shields has hit a wall . Literally . Performing in the Broadway musical Wonderful Town , Brooke was required to sing , dance , and generally stay on her feet for eight grueling shows a week . But just a few days before her final performance , she rushed offstage after one of her dance numbers and ran straight into a pole holding up part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brooke did n't fare as well . One side of her face immediately began to swell up , and Brooke blacked out for a second . " I honestly do n't remember much of what happened after I slammed into the thing , " she says . " But I went back out for my next number . Somehow , the way my brain works , I just thought , Keep going , keep going . " Brooke has had this " show must go on " mantra for as long as she can remember . " I do n't know if it 's a blessing or a curse , " she says as she settles into her chair . She is dressed down in blue jeans and a wrap sweater , her hair blonder than usual and hastily pulled back . She looks nothing like the girl who became famous for bragging that " nothing " came between her and her Calvins . She looks exactly like what she is : a tired mom . brooke became a household name at age 13 , starring in Louis Malle 's Pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sappy teen fare like The Blue Lagoon and Endless Love while maintaining a thriving modeling career tune . Her personal life also made headlines , from her " dates " with stars like Michael Jackson to her relationship with her mother , Teri , who was often portrayed as a controlling stage mom . Later , as Brooke found a second wave of success as the star of the NBC sitcom Suddenly Susan , her marriage to tennis bad boy Andre Agassi made her a tabloid fixture . Brooke would eventually suffer the loss of one of her best friends to suicide , her marriage to " irreconcilable differences , " and her father to cancer . But the star kept plugging along , telling herself that she had to keep on dancing , keep on smiling that impossibly gorgeous smile , no matter how much she might be hurting . But life finally dealt her a blow from which she could not easily recover . After marrying television comedy writer Chris Henchy in 2001 , the star set about mak-ing her longest-held dream come true : having a baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several rounds of fertility treatments and a miscarriage . Brooke persevered , and on May 15 , 2003 , she gave birth to daughter Rowan Francis Henchy . Finally , she had everything she 'd ever wanted : a beautiful baby , a solid career , and a happy marriage . Except that almost immediately after she gave birth , she reveals now , she found herself gripped by a depression that terrified her . She says she was stunned by the powerful feeling and by guilt . " I felt like such an ingrate , " she says . " To finally be granted this miracle , to have the baby you 've worked so hard for , and then feel like you do n't want it .... " She shakes her head . " I grew up thinking , I 'm not going to let anything break me . So to be totally broken-down-that 's not me . And that 's how I knew something was very wrong . " So wrong , in fact , that in the first months after Rowan 's birth , Brooke struggled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her baby . But her determination to muddle through initially prevented her from asking for help . " To feel that removed from your child , " she says , " is not something that 's easy to be honest about . " In her new book , Down Came the Rain : My Journey Through Postpartum Depression , Brooke writes about her lowest points and how she finally found an answer in medication and therapy ( see " Brooke 's Darkest Days , " page 178 ) . " It 's not like I feel this need to be some sort of hero or poster girl , " she says . " It 's just that nobody told me that this sort of depression was even a possibility . IfI had known that this could happen , I probably would have gotten help much sooner . So now maybe someone else can avoid the same pitfalls . " Having emerged from those dark days , Brooke is now happily in love with her baby and her life . " I love being a mother so much . Now I finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says of her connection with her two-year-old daughter . " Rowan woke up early this morning , so I brought her into bed with me . She put her head on the pillow next to mine , and about 30 min-utes later , I woke up to feel someone licking me , " she says with a loud laugh . " I opened my eyes , and she 'd licked my face from my chin to my forehead ! Like she was a puppy ! I do n't know what she 's thinking , but I really did n't mind it . " Brooke says she also wo n't mind undergoing the rigors of getting pregnant again and that she and Henchy want another child in the near future . " I 'm not in the least afraid , " she says . " I 'm armed with so much knowledge now . I know the worst that can happen , and I 'm prepared for it . I do n't think I can be blindsided again . " Lean and taut from performing onstage , Brooke acknowledges that she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utters a statement rarely heard from a celebrity : " I 'd like to gain a little weight , " she says , explaining that she feels it will help during in vitro fertilization procedures . " I really want Rowan to have a sibling , " Brooke continues , aware that being an only child put a strain on her relationship with her own mom , with whom she is now close . " Honestly , I already put so much pressure on my daughter . I want a lot from her . I need a lot from her . And that 's really scary . If I do n't spread this love around a little , it could be difficult for her later in life . I know how that can be ; I do n't want that for her . " So Brooke will add to her brood , even if it means suffering from " baby brain " a little longer . Like most new moms , she ca n't remember the last time she finished a book- " I looked at this one novel on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same place for seven months " - and does n't know what happened to her short-term memory . " I was talking the other day to the woman from the Today show .. . oh , you know who I mean , right ? The cute one ? " she says , completely blanking on the name Katie Comic . " I 'm hopeless , " she says finally . But also hopeful . " I used to feel like when I was performing , there was a place I did n't go to , emotionally , because I did n't want to reveal myself too much , " Brooke says . " But now I realize , I can give it all away onstage , because when I come home at night , I have her , and no one can touch that . This is just the beginning of such a great adventure that we 're going to go on as a family . This is just the start . " - Kate Coyne EXCLUSIVE BOOK EXCERPT Brooke 's darkest days When I walked into my apartment after leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disoriented . My husband , Chris , and I were suddenly alone with a brand-new baby , and we were n't sure what to do . I 'd put so much time , effort , and emotion into getting pregnant-enduring months of fertility treatments , and a miscarriage-that I had n't really considered how my life might change once I actually became a mother . Chris and I had planned to spend a week alone at home with our baby , just the three of us . We figured we would get caught up on sleep and could handle everything ourselves . We could n't have been more wrong . There had been a lot of upheaval in our lives . We 'd moved into this new apartment just three weeks earlier . And the move took place on the day after my dad s death from cancer . I 'd hoped the prospect of meeting his granddaughter would give him strength and a will to survive , but it was not meant to be . Though I could n't wait to get out of the hospital , it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiencing severe carpal tunnel syndrome , which in my case was a side effect of pregnancy . Since I had hardly any feeling in my hands , I could n't manipulate Rowan 's diaper . I would watch Chris do the diapering , and I 'd feel like I was failing at things that were supposed to be the most natural in a woman 's life . I began to spend long periods of time on my bed , staring at the empty wall in front of me . I felt no desire to pick up my baby girl . This shocked me , because I had always loved babies , and Rowan was not only amazing and alert but also quite beautiful . At first I thought what I was feeling was just exhaustion . But it was accompanied now by a sense of panic that I had never felt before . I started to experience a sick sensation in my stomach ; it was as if a vise were tightening around my chest . Sitting on my bed one morning , I let out a deep , slow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotional , as I 'd been told I might after giving birth . This was something quite different . This was sadness of a shockingly different magnitude . It felt as if it would never go away . After only a couple of days at home , I was crying a lot-even while nursing Rowan . Why was I crying more than my baby ? Here I was , finally the mother of a beautiful baby girl I had worked so hard to have , and I felt as if my life were over . rowan 's helplessness terrified me . Rather than wanting to care for my newborn , I wanted to run away . I remember looking out the bedroom window and envisioning myself jumping . I concluded that it would n't be too effective , because our apartment was n't high enough . My mind was filled with visions of escape , and these overshadowed thoughts about my miraculous baby girl . Once , while I sat holding Rowan , I could not avoid the image of her flying through the air and hitting the wall in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and did n't see myself as the one throwing her . But the wall morphed into a video game , and in it her little body smacked against a hard surface and slid down onto the floor . I knew deep in my soul that I would not harm her , but the image all but destroyed me . The only furniture we had in the apartment was a bed , an armchair , a table , and Chris 's old childhood dresser , which was substituting for a changing table . seeing me sitting on the bed , staring out into space , Chris decided to go out to a store and buy a changing table , thinking that setting up the baby 's room would lift my mood . He came back sooner than I 'd expected , and without the table . He looked at me and broke down . " There were women in the store who were happy , Brooke ! " he said . " They were happy to have their babies ! You do n't look at Rowan or sing to her or talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt as if I had been punched in the gut . Chris was my safety net , and now he was falling apart because of me . All I could say was , " I do n't know . I am sorry . I am so sorry . " Chris spoke to my mom and to his own parents , and it was agreed that they should come and help us out . Everyone seemed to think I just needed rest and that this would soon pass . One day , while my morn was on duty , I dragged myself out of bed to sit at the diningroom table with her . She looked at me with a mixture of concern and frustration . " You wanted this baby so badly , " she said . " Give yourself a break . You are always so impatient . She 's so beautiful and so lovable . " I responded in a monotone . " She does n't love me . I know it . " " Of course she does ! You 're her mother . " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any connection to her . This is horrible . I just want to die . " My mom became visibly scared and quietly said , " Remember how devastated you felt when David killed himself ? You do n't want to do the same to those who love you . " All I could do was stare back at her . David Strickland had been like a brother to me . We had worked together for three seasons on my TV show Suddenly Susan and became the best of friends . My life was irreparably changed the day he died , and I miss him terribly . I began thinking that maybe I should just go join David and my father and leave everyone else here on earth . At one point , both my mother-in-law and my mother suggested that I stop breast-feeding to give myself a break . What nobody understood was that I was hanging on to the breast-feeding as my lifeline . It was the only thing that made me unique in terms of caring for Rowan . Without it , she might be lost to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit , a few days later , with my OB-GYN quickly turned into a lengthy Mommy checkup . While the baby stayed with Chris and a nurse , the doctor guided me into an empty exam room . I told him I was not doing well at all , that I thought 1 was not meant to be a mother . The doctor said many women experienced the baby blues and that he would keep checking on me . It might also help , he suggested , for me to talk to other mothers I knew and get their perspective . In addition to referring us to a pediatrician , he proposed that Rowan and I come back in a week . Rowan would surely be fine , I thought , but to me , a week sounded like an eternity . As I reentered the apartment , the desperate feelings came flooding back . My friend Sherie came over with a stack of information on postpartum depression and begged me to page through the material . It sounded totally irrelevant to me . Postpartum depression was an affliction I associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like driving into a lake . I had no intention of ever harming my baby . I was simply a woman who should n't have had a child . After my checkup , the doctor phoned me daily . He 'd been thinking about what I 'd said to him about my mood . Because it sounded so severe and so out of character for me , he suggested I might want to see a therapist and even try some medication . He said he could start me on a low dose of Paxil , an antidepressant . It was nonaddictive , safe for breast-feeding , and I would take it only for a few months . I said I would think about it , but I did n't like the idea of taking drugs . None of the women I knew had needed medication after giving birth , and I felt I should n't either . Here was yet another sign of my weakness and failure as a mother . When I told Chris about the doctors suggestions , he was relieved . He knew I came from a family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained that many people took medication for a myriad of reasons-it would n't have to be forever , and if it made me feel better , it was worth a try . I finally agreed to try the medicine . I was told the drug might take as long as two weeks to start working . I grudgingly took the first dose and waited to feel better . CHRIS IS A TELEVISION COMEDY WRITER , AND THREE weeks after Rowan 's birth , he had to fly to Los Angeles for work . He was to be gone for a whole week , and the thought of him leaving made me very anxious . A couple of days after Chris left , I called my stepsister Diana and told her that I wanted to go back in time , before my father died and before I challenged my life by having a child . She would n't get off the phone until I promised her I 'd get a baby nurse , even if it was just for a little while . Roughly half an hour after making the call to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . She was from the Philippines , about my age , and she smelled as if she had just bathed with Johnson 's shampoo and Ivory soap . I felt so comfortable around her and loved it when she began calling me by my nickname , Brookie . In short order , she got Rowan and me on a schedule and infused our lives with a sense of order . She had a subtle way of instructing and encouraging . She managed to help me feel like I was in control and handling things well . Over the next three weeks , even though I still felt a deep heaviness in my heart , I stopped crying as much . Maybe the medicine was helping . I realized that I still had many emotions to sort through and needed to talk to a professional . But before I found one , I made a huge mistake . Two days after Chris returned from his trip , we had decided to move back to the West Coast for a while . Things were going more smoothly now , and I decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we got settled in Los Angeles , I stopped taking the pink pills . I did n't call my doctor in New York to tell him , because it did n't seem like a big deal . I did n't wean myself or tell anyone I was going off the medicine . I did n't even tell Chris , because I knew he would object , and deep down , I did n't want to be told to stay on it . Stubbornly , I believed I 'd be OK . One day , I decided to take Rowan to the studio lot to visit friends from the crew of Suddenly Susan . I knew they 'd be thrilled to meet my little girl . It was such a familiar environment that I felt like I had returned home . As we reminisced about how much fun we 'd had , I started to get weepy . People kept commenting on how great it must be for me to be a mom and to not have to deal with the craziness of show business . It seemed to me that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet I felt that I was n't handling my current " job " as a mom so well either . My sense of identity was shaken . I hit traffic on the drive home and got the terrible feeling that I was going to ram the car into the wall on the side of the freeway . The baby was in back , and though I did n't think of hurting her , I wanted to smash through the window myself . The next morning , I told Chris what had happened . When I volunteered that I had gone off the drug , he said I needed to talk to someone who could really help . I thought about how my friend David had spiraled out of control . It turned out that he , too , had gone off his medication without telling his doctor . Why did I think I would be exempt from the side effects ? I called my gynecologist in Los Angeles and filled her in on what a tough time I 'd had since Rowan 's birth . She said it sounded like postpartum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not mean that I was crazy or that somehow it was my fault . She also said there were no medals being handed out to people who chose to stay miserable . Medicine existed for a reason . Not treating the illness would be irresponsible. , I finally heard the wake-up call , and I started taking the pink pill again . And , once a week , I spoke with a therapist about my life and about being a mom . One of the issues the therapist helped me deal with was what it meant to bring a child into the world . I realized that I had n't factored in the devastating fatigue , the loss of personal freedom , and the overwhelming fear that are all parts of being a parent . I started to see that even more than mourning my old life and the freedoms that I thought it had afforded , I was worried primarily about failing Rowan . I was afraid that my child would n't think I was the best mom she could ever have and would n't love me deeply . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What I learned is that very few people know what they 're doing when they first have kids , and I was n't going to fail at this , because it was n't a test . We also talked about the rite of passage that happens when you become a mother . It 's no secret that I had-and continue to have , to some extent-a complicated relationship with my own mother . My parents were divorced when I was five months old , and though as a child I spent time with my father 's larger and more conventional family , the majority of my days were spent with my bohemian mother . It was often us against the world , and I 'd developed an intense connection with her . For the longest time , my mother 's word had been my gospel ; I even thought she could make it rain . When I was about four , I got a raincoat and a rain hat as a gift . I insisted on wearing them , even though the forecast was for a sunny day . My mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , " That 's OK ; you 'll make it rain , Mommy . " Well , as fate would have it , by the time we got to the end of the block , it had started to pour . I looked up at her and said , " You see ? " In a sense , I had always assumed that I was an extension of my mother . Now , I could gather strength from the fact that Rowan had helped me to separate from her . I would always be my mom 's little girl , but my loyalty had shifted , now that I had a child of my own . This made me sad and yet made me feel more grownup and empowered . But Rowan has also helped me appreciate everything my mother had done for me . She instilled in me good manners and a respect for others . She showed me the fundamental differences between right and wrong . She nurtured in me the ability to laugh , to love deeply , and to celebrate life . I hope I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first birthday approached , our lives became more settled . I felt peaceful and was happy focusing on my family and getting healthy . And though it seemed that Chris was holding his breath , hoping my good mood would n't change , it was clear our marriage was also going to survive and had , in fact , become even stronger . I began celebrating our daughter and our life together die way I had hoped to . These days , Rowan constantly inspires me , making me want to become a better mom , a stronger wife , a more honest actress . Of course , I dread the inevitable day when she blames me for everything wrong in her life . For now , she thinks I can make it rain , and I am letting her believe that for as long as I can .
