Maria Full of Grace by <p> Joshua Marston <p> Registered WGAe #129546-00 2001 Joshua Marston <p> FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT <p> IN A SMALL TOWN TO THE NORTH OF BOGOTA , COLOMBIA ... <p> EXT . HILLSIDE , BEHIND A SMALL BUILDING - DAY <p> The landscape is a poor neighborhood of narrow , unpaved roads etched into the side of a hill overlooking a small Colombian town . The buildings are all low - one and two-story - made of poured concrete and cinder-block with lines of laundry stretching from one to the other . <p> In back of a building , MARIA , 17 with black wavy hair and dark eyes , is making out with JUAN , 19 and skinny as a rail . Their lips are absolutely locked . <p> Juan puts one hand behind her waist and presses her up against the wall . As he moves from kissing her lips to her cheek , Maria opens her eyes - looking rather unenthusiastic . Juan buries his face in her neck , but Maria is staring up at the pattern of a TV aerial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ALL DIALOGUE IS IN SPANISH ) <p> # JUAN # Let 's go to your house . <p> # MARIA # I do n't want to go to my house . <p> # JUAN # Where do you want to go then ? <p> # MARIA # I do n't know . Someplace else . <p> Maria gazes up at the top of the building and smiles . <p> MARIA ( CONT 'D ) How about up there ? <p> # JUAN # ( looks up ) On the roof ? Why do you wan na go up there ? <p> # MARIA # Why not ? ... Come on . It 's not that high . <p> # JUAN # What are you crazy ? <p> # MARIA # ( fixes him ) See how you treat me ? You 're a drag . <p> # JUAN # Let 's not get started with this , OK ? <p> # MARIA # If I go up there will you follow me ? <p> # JUAN # ( reticent ) If I go , are we gon na do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes a good look at the back of the building . She puts her foot on a rock and pulls herself up to a first-floor window-sill . She finds a small ledge and continues to scale up . <p> Juan looks sure she wo n't make it up . Maria concentrates on what she 's doing - never looking down . <p> She pulls herself up to a second-floor window , but then gets stuck about six feet below the roof . <p> JUAN ( CONT 'D ) Come down . We 'll go to your place . <p> Maria places her foot on a very small protrusion and pushes up - she SLIPS but grabs the edge of the roof just in time and pulls herself up . Juan stares up in disbelief . <p> # MARIA # ( smiles , looking down ) Come on . Your turn . <p> # JUAN # No way . <p> # MARIA # Come up - I have something to tell you . <p> # JUAN # Come down . <p> # MARIA # No . <p> Beat . Juan looks around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # JUAN # You know what then , I 'm taking off . <p> # MARIA # ( exasperated ) Then go . I 'm not coming down . <p> # JUAN # Fine . You can come down the same way you went up - alone . I 'll see ya . <p> Juan starts to walk away down the hill . <p> Maria watches him go , down toward a small , isolated town ringed by mountains . <p> CUT TO : <p> INT . BEDROOM - BEFORE DAWN <p> In a small bedroom with lime-green walls and two single beds , Maria lies ASLEEP with her walkman next to her pillow . On the wall above her are torn-out magazine pictures of various teen idols , salsa stars , and a pink cartoon teddy-bear . <p> Maria 's mother JUANA calls from the other room , <p> JUANA ( OS ) Maria . Get up . <p> INT . BATHROOM - BEFORE DAWN <p> A precarious electric water-heating element mounted on the shower-head , with wires sticking out of it , shifts into the On position . Maria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . KITCHEN / MAIN ROOM - BEFORE DAWN <p> PACHO , one year old , is CRYING on his back on a tattered couch in the main room of the small house . Maria 's sister DIANA , 19 , stands over him , pressing down on his stomach . <p> ROSITA , Maria 's grandmother , moves to and from the cramped kitchen setting out cups of hot chocolate and rolls . JUANA , 40 , is already dressed and folding laundry . <p> # DIANA # His stomach is hard . I 'm really worried . <p> Maria comes in combing her hair . <p> # MARIA # What are you doing ? <p> # DIANA # He has n't shit in like two days . He 's really constipated . <p> # MARIA # Whatever . He 'll go when he goes . Do n't worry about it . <p> # JUANA # Maria , do n't brush your hair in the dining room please . <p> # MARIA # He 's cranky because he 's got someone kneading his stomach like a ball of dough . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is n't that right ? <p> Maria picks Pacho up and holds him over her head . She throws him and catches him . <p> # DIANA # ( taking him back ) You 're scaring him . <p> # JUANA # Give him to me . <p> # ROSITA # ( setting down hot chocolate ) Maria , sit . <p> Juana takes the baby and gives Diana a blanket . <p> # JUANA # Mama , will you fix a tea for him ? <p> # MARIA # Those teas are n't gon na do anything for him . <p> # ROSITA # Take him to the doctor this afternoon . <p> # DIANA # No Grandma , I do n't trust that guy . <p> # MARIA # ( gets up ) He does n't need to go to the doctor . The kid is fine . <p> Maria goes into the kitchen and opens the fridge . <p> # ROSITA # What are you looking for ? <p> # MARIA # I do n't know . I do n't feel like bread . I want something else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself . <p> # ROSITA # That 's your breakfast ? <p> EXT . ROAD - DARK MORNING <p> Maria , Juana and Diana walk along a dark , dusty road before dawn . The only light comes from the windows of other houses they pass . <p> They turn onto a PAVED STREET and stop at an arbitrary spot on the sidewalk and wait with several other people . There 's a minimum of ambient morning light ; it 's cold , people huddle . <p> A creaky , old SCHOOL BUS lumbers up and everyone files on - except for Maria . Juana kisses Maria 's cheek and gets on . <p> # JUANA # See you later , honey . <p> The bus pulls away and Maria continues to wait . <p> INT . MOVING BUS ( ANOTHER ) - VERY EARLY MORNING <p> Maria sits by the window with BLANCA , also 17 but heavier-set than Maria . The bus lurches along . The seats are full of other people ( mostly women ) , but there is no conversation - only the sound of the driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maria 's shoulder . Maria stares out at the passing farmland and cows . <p> EXT . PLANTATION GATEHOUSE - LATER <p> Maria and Blanca get off the bus and merge into a small sea of people who funnel through a tall steel gate past a uniformed guard with steel-toed boots and a shotgun . On the other side , the grounds are landscaped and spotless . <p> INT . CHANGING ROOMS - CONTINUOUS <p> Maria , Blanca and about two dozen other women put on blue jumpsuits over their clothes , along with thick , rubber boots . <p> INT . EATING ROOM - CONTINUOUS <p> In a large room with long wooden tables and benches , about a hundred workers eat breakfast . There is a din of conversation . At one table , Blanca eats a roll as Maria interrogates her . <p> # MARIA # So did you meet him ? <p> # BLANCA # I waited by the plaza but he never came . <p> # MARIA # Are you kidding ? He did n't show up ? <p> # BLANCA # Well it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> # MARIA # ( laughing ) How long did you wait ? <p> # BLANCA # Do n't laugh . <p> # MARIA # I 'm not laughing . How long did you wait ? <p> # BLANCA # It does n't matter . He was n't really my type ... Anyway ... You see that guy over there ? <p> They both turn and look at a GUY in a green jumpsuit sitting two tables away . He makes eye contact with Blanca and SMILES . <p> BLANCA ( CONT 'D ) He smiles at me like all the time . <p> The two of them GIGGLE uncontrollably . <p> INT . BATHROOM - LATER <p> Maria stands at the basin of the plantation bathroom . She splashes water on her face and rinses her mouth . <p> INT . FLOWER PLANTATION - LATER <p> In a vast greenhouse , rows and rows of tall pink-rose plants extend into the distance . A space-man wearing a thick rubber suit , a rubber face mask and a rubber head-covering walks through spraying a fine mist of chemical fumigants onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roses . <p> This is a high-volume flower plantation . MARIA works in the warehouse - an immense hangar with a high roof and about eighty workers all in blue jumpsuits . There are flowers everywhere - bundles of reds , yellows , oranges , and violets . <p> The whole place is a hive of activity : some workers guide large carts on a rail-system into the warehouse ; some measure and classify the roses into bundles ; some place the bundles in large boxes for shipment abroad . It is a tightly regimented operation . <p> Maria wears thick rubber gloves and stands in front of a splintering plywood board . Next to her is a huge bunch of 100 red roses . One by one , she takes the roses , examines the quality of the buds , measures the length , and then with a quick , violent jerk she pulls them over an open blade to strip off the thorns . It 's a tedious , repetitive action . She is one in a line of twenty people doing the same work . <p> She catches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the hole in the tip of her glove . Her skin is dotted with thorn scars . She 's sweating profusely and she wipes her forehead with her sleeve . <p> A SUPERVISOR walks from station to station tallying each worker 's output on a clipboard . <p> In another aisle , about twenty feet away , Blanca has the job of bundling roses . She sets down corrugated paper and then one by one carefully arranges and wraps the flowers , staples the bundle shut and labels it - then starts all over again . <p> Maria stares at the supervisor , who is now several stations up . She has paused in her work again and is watching everything else in the room with a removed , critical stare . She continues to perspire and looks physically ill . She raises her hand , trying to get her supervisor 's attention . <p> As the supervisor happens to look up he sees Maria 's hand in the air , sighs and makes his way back to her . <p> # SUPERVISOR # What is it ? <p> # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # SUPERVISOR # Again ? <p> # MARIA # I do n't feel well . <p> # SUPERVISOR # You 've already been twice this morning . You 're under by four bins this hour , three last hour . How are you going to catch up if you keep going to the bathroom ? <p> He stares at her expectantly . <p> # MARIA # Please . I 'll be quick . <p> # SUPERVISOR # Do you know what it 's like for me always having to look over your shoulder , Maria ? You think it 's fun for me ? I have eighty-four workers in this section and everyone else puts their head down and does their job . But with you , it 's like this constant game of tug-of-war just to get you to make quota . At this point , I ... <p> All of the sudden Maria VOMITS directly on the flowers , splattering her supervisor slightly . <p> SUPERVISOR ( CONT 'D ) What the hell is wrong with you ? ! This is disgusting . Look at this . What the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . <p> SUPERVISOR ( CONT 'D ) Look at these flowers . What are you gon na do about these ? Huh ? What are you gon na do ? <p> She just stares at the flowers blankly . <p> SUPERVISOR ( CONT 'D ) ( exasperated ) Pick those up . <p> Maria scoops up the bundle of flowers in her arms - vomit and all . With Blanca and the rest watching , the supervisor leads her over to a large BASIN . <p> SUPERVISOR ( CONT 'D ) Set them there . <p> Maria sets the flowers on a cart . He picks up a HOSE with a spray nozzle and twists it until it shoots a fine mist . <p> SUPERVISOR ( cont 'd ) ( passing her the hose ) Wash them off . <p> Maria picks up a rose and sprays it off . <p> SUPERVISOR ( CONT 'D ) Be careful with the bud . <p> # MARIA # But they 're already ruined . <p> # SUPERVISOR # I do n't care . Wash them . <p> # MARIA # I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( really pissed ) You want to go to the bathroom , then you can go on your lunch break ... Or you can go right now and keep walking out the door. ( he stares her down ) I want all these flowers clean . And when you 're done , you 're gon na go back to your station and make up the bins you owe me . Understood ? <p> The supervisor marches off , leaving Maria there - fuming . <p> EXT . TOWN , STREETS - DAY <p> Maria sits on a park bench and picks at her lunch , as a group of kids her age , dressed in school uniforms , passes by . She makes eye contact with one but they move on past . She checks the time . <p> EXT . STREET - AFTERNOON <p> In town . Maria walks up the street . <p> JUANA ( OS ) Maria ! <p> Maria sees her mother at a small store buying fruits and vegetables . She crosses over to her . <p> Juana pays for the two bags of groceries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She picks up the bags and the two of them walk on in silence . <p> INT . PHARMACY - CONTINUOUS <p> It 's a small place with the drugs on the wall behind the counter . Diana watches as a WOMAN removes foil-wrapped TABLETS from a box and counts them out . Juana enters , trailed by Maria . <p> # JUANA # Is everything OK ? <p> # DIANA # It 's 9,600 . Do you have any money ? <p> # JUANA # ( to Maria ) Lend your sister the money . <p> # MARIA # Why do I have to pay for it ? <p> # DIANA # It 's for Pacho . He started vomiting . <p> # MARIA # So ? Where 's your money ? <p> # JUANA # Maria ! <p> # MARIA # I give up practically all of what I make and Diana does n't put in any of hers . And now I 'm supposed to pay for Pacho 's medicine too ? <p> # JUANA # Maria do n't start ! Give your sister the money . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pocket and hands over the money . <p> JUANA ( cont 'd ) You can keep the extra nine-thousand six-hundred when you get paid at the end of the month . I do n't know why everything always has to be so difficult with you . <p> Maria watches Diana pay . And then , as if trying to get back at them , she says , <p> # MARIA # Well , there 's not going to be a next paycheck ... Because I quit . <p> # JUANA # What ? When ? <p> # MARIA # Today . <p> # JUANA # What happened ? <p> # MARIA # They would n't let me go to the bathroom . <p> # JUANA # At all ? <p> # MARIA # It 's not just that . I do n't like the way they treat me . So I quit . <p> # JUANA # What are you going to do ? <p> The woman behind the counter looks very uncomfortable . <p> # DIANA # You 're really fucking stupid . <p> # MARIA # Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tell me to shut up ! <p> # MARIA # You do n't know how they treated me . <p> # DIANA # You could have put up with it . You 're an idiot ... <p> # MARIA # ( overlapping ) Why do I have to put up with it ? Why am I always the one to put up with it all ? <p> # DIANA # ( overlapping ) ... Why do n't you think of the family for once . <p> # JUANA # Enough ! Quiet , both of you ! ( beat ) Maria , you have to go back and ask for your job back . <p> # MARIA # No . I 'm not going back . <p> # DIANA # Then what are you going to do ? <p> # MARIA # I 'll find something else . <p> # JUANA # There 's nothing but flowers around here . At least it 's a decent job . <p> # MARIA # Oh please , what 's decent about it ? <p> # JUANA # Maria ! You have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear me ? I 'm not going back ... I 'm not ! <p> With that , Maria storms out of the pharmacy and leaves them standing there . <p> EXT . PLAZA - EARLY EVENING <p> Maria sits by the plaza fountain with Juan and Blanca and a group of about five other girls and guys crowded around . Juan 's got a BOTTLE of aguardiente and everyone is laughing , except Maria , who has n't shaken her bad mood . <p> # BLANCA # ( laughing ) You should have seen the look on the supervisor 's face ... He was completely covered in it ... <p> # JUAN # This deserves a toast . <p> Juan pours a shot for Maria in a little plastic cup . <p> JUAN ( CONT 'D ) To Maria ! Because she kicks ass ! <p> She sips it , winces and then swallows the rest in one gulp . <p> SMASH CUT TO : <p> EXT . OUTDOOR FIESTA - NIGHT <p> A small rocket whizzes into the air and EXPLODES . On a side-street off the plaza , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band of a dozen local guys ( in uniform ) playing a slightly sloppy , but very energetic salsa - and a crowd of about forty people of all ages - some dancing , some watching . <p> Maria and Blanca dance up a storm together - Maria dancing lead . She 's a very good dancer , very lively and quite sexy . Most of all , she just has a good time - giggling and laughing with Blanca . Juan and the guys are sitting on the curb working their way steadily through the bottle of aguardiente . <p> The music stops and all the dancers fan themselves off - Juan walks among the band members pouring each a shot of liquor . <p> # MARIA # ( to Blanca ) Hey there 's your boyfriend . <p> Blanca follows Maria 's gaze and sees the SMILING GUY from work talking with a FRIEND . Sure enough , he makes eye contact with Blanca and smiles . <p> # BLANCA # ( giggling and turning away ) Oh my god . <p> # MARIA # You have to dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Hearing that , Maria grabs Blanca 's wrist and leads her right over to the Smiling Guy and his Friend . <p> # MARIA # Hi . <p> # SMILING GUY # Hi . <p> # MARIA # I 'm Maria . This is Blanca . <p> # BLANCA # ( beet red ) Oh my god . <p> # SMILING GUY # I 'm Felipe . This is my cousin Franklin . <p> # FRANKLIN # Hi . <p> Unlike Felipe , Franklin is dressed stylishly , with a hip shirt , designer jeans and a gold chain . Next to him , Felipe looks downright meek . <p> # MARIA # Blanca wants you to ask her to dance . <p> # FRANKLIN # Go for it . <p> # FELIPE # ( smiling ) Do you want to dance ? <p> # BLANCA # ... OK . <p> Felipe leads Blanca out into the dance area as the band strikes up . Maria watches them dance and then walks over to Juan . <p> # MARIA # Juan , I want to dance . <p> Juan is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy friends . He takes her in his arms and mock dances drunkenly in a circle , laughing . She breaks away annoyed . <p> MARIA ( cont 'd ) What 's wrong with you ? <p> # JUAN # ( drunk ) What ... why ? <p> She walks away and stands watching Blanca and Felipe . <p> # FRANKLIN # ( out of nowhere ) Wan na dance ? <p> Maria considers it , glances toward Juan ... <p> FRANKLIN ( cont 'd ) What do you say ? <p> # MARIA # ... Sure . <p> Franklin leads her out and the two of them dance . The more she dances , the more into it Maria gets - looking over at Juan occasionally - as if she were dancing to spite him . <p> EXT . TOWN - DAY <p> Maria walks the dirt road down the hill and into town . <p> She walks by several store fronts , looking occasionally inside . Her gait is slow and not particularly determined . <p> INT . MUSIC SHOP - DAY <p> Maria steps into a small music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , and racks full of cassettes on either wall . A MAN catalogues boxes of music as Latin rap plays on a small stereo . He nods at Maria - they seem to recognize each other . She takes a tape off the wall and examines it . <p> # MARIA # How much is it ? <p> # MAN # ( turns the music down ) Fifteen thousand , two hundred . <p> Maria puts it back on the wall . She watches the man work . <p> # MARIA # You have a lot of work . <p> # MAN # I have to catalogue everything , keep track of what I sold , what I did n't . <p> Maria contemplates asking him for a job ... but the store is obviously a one-man operation . <p> INT . CHURCH - DAY <p> Maria comes into the Catholic CHURCH where a couple of older women talk quietly in the pews . She kneels down , crosses herself , mutters a Hail Mary , and then adds her own , silent request . <p> EXT . MOTORBIKE REPAIR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an outdoor garage that is packed with mopeds and motorcycles . JUAN is squatting next to a mechanic watching him work . <p> # MARIA # Juan . <p> # JUAN # ( looks up ) In a minute . <p> # MARIA # Come on . ( to Blanca ) I 'll see you later . <p> Blanca kisses Maria 's cheek and leaves as Juan finally crosses to the front and gets his bicycle . He and Maria cross the street to ... <p> EXT . SAUSAGE STAND / PARK - LATER <p> A small stand serving arepas across from a park . Maria and Juan each take an arepa and a Coca-cola . Juan pays and takes the change . <p> They walk over to the park and sit on the grass and eat . They do n't have any conversation at all while they eat - they just chew in silence . At a certain point Maria stops and watches Juan take another bite - he 's absorbed in chewing . <p> # MARIA # I have something to tell you . <p> # JUAN # What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pregnant . <p> He looks at her . <p> # JUAN # You 're not fucking with me , right ? <p> # MARIA # I missed my last two periods and I 've been feeling sick . <p> # JUAN # What are you going to do ? <p> # MARIA # I do n't know . <p> # JUAN # Who else knows ? <p> # MARIA # Only you . <p> # JUAN # No-one else ? <p> # MARIA # Who else do you think I told ? The whole world ? <p> # JUAN # I do n't know . Maybe Blanca , since she seems to know everything before me ... <p> # MARIA # ( cutting him off ) No Juan , Blanca does n't know . <p> Long silence ... Very long silence . <p> # JUAN # Maria ... Do you want to get married ? <p> # MARIA # ( laughs nervously ) Are you joking ? <p> # JUAN # Why ? <p> # MARIA # Where would we live ? <p> # JUAN # In my house . Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people living in your house . You share your bedroom with your brother . <p> # JUAN # What do you suggest ? <p> # MARIA # My house would be better . <p> # JUAN # Right , a lot better ! A guy living in his girlfriend 's house ? No way , not that Maria . <p> # MARIA # You 're really fucking stupid , you know that ? <p> # JUAN # Stupid ? Your family hates me . How do you expect me to live there ? We can live at my house . ( beat ) I do n't see why you do n't want to get married . I 'm stepping up to this ... <p> Maria takes a beat - stares at him . <p> # MARIA # Juan , do you love me ? <p> # JUAN # ( groans ) Not this again . <p> # MARIA # Look me in the eye and tell me you love me ... What kind of person are you ? You want to marry a woman you do n't love ? A woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that ? How long 's it gon na be before you 're sleeping with some other girl ? A month ? <p> # JUAN # You know that 's not gon na happen . <p> # MARIA # I do n't want the same thing to happen to me that happened to my sister . <p> # JUAN # ( attacking ) I hate to break it to you but your sister was a fucking idiot who slept with the first guy that walked by ... <p> # MARIA # Shut up ! <p> # JUAN # ... and left her with a kid . <p> # MARIA # You ca n't talk about my sister like that . <p> # JUAN # You know I 'm not going anywhere . <p> # MARIA # That does n't change anything . I 'm not marrying you . <p> # JUAN # Well you 're gon na have to . <p> # MARIA # No , Juan . I do n't have to do anything . <p> # JUAN # See how you are ? You 're stubborn . <p> # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( beat ) I 'm not even in love with you . <p> # JUAN # ... Me neither . <p> # MARIA # ( stares at him ) Perfect . <p> Maria gets up and walks off through the park . <p> INT . MARIA 'S BEDROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT <p> Maria sits up in bed playing with one of Pacho 's stuffed animals . She rolls on her side and stares over at her sister , asleep with Pacho . Maria grips at her sheet - angry , frustrated , frightened . <p> EXT . STREET IN TOWN - DAY <p> Maria waits at a BUS STOP with three or four WOMEN . <p> FRANKLIN rides by - they make eye contact - he makes a U-turn and pulls up on his motorcycle . <p> # FRANKLIN # Hi . <p> # MARIA # Hi . <p> # FRANKLIN # Where are you going ? <p> # MARIA # To the city . <p> # FRANKLIN # Hop on . I 'll give you a ride . <p> # MARIA # To Bogota ? <p> # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arms around Franklin 's waist . <p> EXT . MOVING MOTORCYCLE - CONTINUOUS <p> Maria and Franklin ride through the streets . The scenery changes as they go from the center of town and then into an expanse of open country . Taking curves faster and faster . <p> Maria is clearly getting a rush being on the back of Franklin 's motorcycle , the wind in her face . <p> EXT . JUICE STAND - DAY <p> At a juice stand by the side of the road , the girl behind the counter scoops fruit into a blender . <p> # FRANKLIN # I like the way you dance . <p> # MARIA # Really ? You too . <p> # FRANKLIN # I did n't think people around here could dance . I thought they were all stiff . <p> # MARIA # ... Where are you from ? <p> # FRANKLIN # I 'm from a little town called Santa Rosa de Cabal . About ten minutes from Pereira . You know it ? <p> # MARIA # No . <p> # FRANKLIN # They have some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> # MARIA # Yeah ? <p> Franklin flashes her a smile . Maria looks away , blushing . <p> MARIA ( cont 'd ) ( beat ) So why are you here ? <p> # FRANKLIN # ... Various reasons . <p> The girl sets down two glasses of juice . Franklin takes his and walks toward the little tables on the grass behind the stand . Maria follows . <p> FRANKLIN ( cont 'd ) ... It was nothing . I just had to get away for a while . I had some problems and things started heating up . As soon as it all calms down I 'm going back ... ( beat ) ... So , what are you going to Bogota for ? <p> # MARIA # I have a friend who works there . She works for this rich family , in their house . She 's gon na help me out getting a job . <p> Franklin begins to laugh . <p> MARIA ( CONT 'D ) Do n't laugh . <p> # FRANKLIN # I 'm sorry ... It 's just that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maid . Way too cute to be getting dressed up in a hat and apron . Those people 'll treat you like shit . <p> # MARIA # ( defensive ) ... Anyway , I was just gon na check it out . It was n't definite . <p> She moves away from him - sits at one of the little tables . <p> # FRANKLIN # ( studies her , sits ) You lost your job at the plantation , right ? <p> # MARIA # Who told you ? <p> # FRANKLIN # ... Felipe ... <p> # MARIA # That 's a lie . They did n't fire me . <p> # FRANKLIN # Oh no ? <p> # MARIA # You 've got bad information .

I know of a good job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> # FRANKLIN # To the United States . <p> # MARIA # What 's the job ? <p> # FRANKLIN # ( beat ) Working as a mule ... You know what a mule is , or not ? <p> Maria looks away . She clearly knows . <p> FRANKLIN ( cont 'd ) It 's a cool job . You go , hand off the stuff , get your cash . And that 's it ... Like winning the lottery . <p> # MARIA # Yeah , but it 's dangerous , right ? <p> # FRANKLIN # How many mules do you know ? <p> # MARIA # Me ? None . <p> # FRANKLIN # Well , I know a bunch . <p> # MARIA # What about the ones on the news ? The ones in prison far away . What about them ? <p> # FRANKLIN # ( laughs ) Those are the ones who want to be famous . They get caught , get on TV , everyone sees them and they become famous . <p> # MARIA # ( does n't laugh ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # FRANKLIN # I know a guy who can set it all up . Takes care of the papers , makes the arrangements ... <p> Maria looks away - nervous . Franklin reads her immediately . <p> FRANKLIN ( cont 'd ) You know what - forget about it . ( stands ) Let 's go . <p> He starts to walk toward his motorcycle . Maria hesitates . <p> # MARIA # Wait. ( he turns ) ... How much would I get ? <p> Hold on Maria . <p> EXT . BOGOTA STREETS / BAR - DAY <p> Bogota is loud and chaotic - buses clog the streets , horns blare , waves of people crowd the sidewalks . <p> With Maria 's arms around his waist Franklin weaves in and out of city traffic and pulls up in front of a bar on a sidestreet in an uncertain neighborhood . <p> INT . BAR - DAY <p> It 's a dimly-lit place with a pool table at the back and tables along the wall opposite the bar . It 's filled almost entirely with MEN , all older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> # FRANKLIN # You want something to drink ... ? ( to the bartender ) Give me a beer and a soda for her ... ( to Maria ) I 'm gon na talk to this guy . I 'll just be a minute . <p> He leaves Maria at the bar and heads to the back table where a MAN sits with the only other WOMAN in the place . Franklin shakes the man 's hand and points to Maria . Maria sips her soda . <p> Franklin comes back over and waits with Maria . A moment later , the woman at the far table gets up . She makes very definite eye contact with Maria as she walks out . <p> FRANKLIN ( CONT 'D ) Come on . <p> Franklin introduces Maria to JAVIER , a well-groomed man of about 60 with a gold chain , an ironed shirt and a cane leaning up against the table .

STREET / BUS STOP - LATER <p> Maria walks across the busy street and stops at the bus stop . Among the people waiting for the bus , Maria recognizes the WOMAN who was sitting at Javier 's table in the bar . A moment later the BUS rolls up and they all get on . <p> INT . BUS - CONTINUOUS <p> Maria sees a free seat next to the WOMAN . She sits . The woman recognizes Maria but neither of them says anything . <p> # MARIA # You were in the bar , right ? ( no response ) My name is Maria . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> # WOMAN # I 'm Lucy . <p> LUCY looks to be about 24 . She 's dressed nicely - not fancy , just more stylish than Maria . But from the way she carries herself and talks she 's clearly from the same class as Maria . <p> # MARIA # Do you work for Javier ... ? Is it hard ? <p> # LUCY # ( not making eye contact ) It 's not easy but it 's not too difficult either ... How old are you ? <p> # MARIA # Seventeen . I said eighteen , though . <p> # LUCY # ( looks at Maria ) You just have to be prepared and know how to do it right . <p> Maria takes this in . <p> INT . MARIA 'S HOUSE - DAY <p> Maria comes home . Diana is folding clothes at the table . Maria walks right past her toward the kitchen . <p> # DIANA # Where have you been ? <p> # MARIA # I went to the city to ask Jessica to find me work . <p> # DIANA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # And nothing . It 's none of your business . <p> # DIANA # Do n't tell me it 's none of my business . <p> # MARIA # It is n't . <p> # DIANA # You did n't find anything . You 'd tell me if you found something ... You have to go back to the plantation and ask for your job back . <p> # MARIA # No , I do n't . <p> # DIANA # It 's not fair to mom . You know how hard it is for her and now you 're making things even worse . <p> # MARIA # Get off my back . <p> # DIANA # ( getting emotional ) Do n't tell me to get off your fucking back .

Cut the shit . <p> Maria stares at Diana . She then reaches into her pocket and pulls out the money Javier gave her . Diana 's eyes widen . Maria peels off a few bills and throws them down . <p> # MARIA # At least I put in my share . <p> Maria storms out of the kitchen and into her room where she flops onto her bed , fuming . She SLAMS the door . <p> EXT . STREET , A NEARBY TOWN - DAY <p> Maria walks up the street in another town , slightly bigger than her own . She knocks on the door of a concrete house slightly nicer than her own . The door opens and it 's LUCY . <p> # LUCY # Hi . <p> INT . LUCY 'S HOUSE - DAY <p> Lucy 's house is nice - spacious though vacant-feeling with a large table and chairs , and a relatively new hi-fi . Maria sits alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - full of GRAPES . She sits . <p> # LUCY # Here. ( hands Maria a grape ) Hold it in your mouth . <p> Maria puts it in her mouth and holds it there . <p> LUCY ( cont 'd ) Just hold it . Let it slide to the back . All the way . Now open your throat . <p> Maria gags - then bites into the grape and swallows it . <p> LUCY ( CONT 'D ) You have to practice with the grapes . <p> Lucy passes her the bag of grapes . Maria picks one out . <p> # MARIA # You can swallow that ? <p> Lucy puts a grape in her mouth and swallows it whole . Maria stares in horrified awe . <p> # LUCY # You ca n't eat anything for the last twenty-four hours . Your stomach has to be totally empty . They 'll lie about how many you have to swallow . <p> # MARIA # How many will it be ? <p> # LUCY # For someone your size , maybe sixty or seventy pellets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LUCY # Be glad you 're little . Big guys swallow like ninety or a hundred ... Make sure they 're well wrapped . If even one of them opens up inside you you 'll die . Not as fast as cocaine . Cocaine will make your heart explode immediately . Heroin takes longer , but you still die unless you get the right medicine . <p> Maria 's eyes widen . <p> LUCY ( CONT 'D ) Wear nice clothes . Nothing flashy , just something nice - so you do n't look like a peasant . They may ask you questions in the airport . Javier will tell you what to say . <p> # MARIA # How many times have you done this ? <p> # LUCY # ... Two . <p> # MARIA # And it went OK ? <p> # LUCY # ... I 'm still here .

How am I going to explain how I got here ? I love her but we 're really different , you know ? She would kill me if she knew I was doing this .

Everything 's in perfect squares . <p> INT . BATHROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT <p> Maria stands in front of the mirror and places a grape in her mouth . She tries to swallow it and GAGS . She tries again . She looks very nervous - almost on the verge of tears . <p> EXT . YARD - DAY <p> In the yard behind her house Maria is washing laundry by hand . Blanca sits watching her . <p> # BLANCA # So how 's that thing ? <p> # MARIA # What thing ? <p> # BLANCA # Your job ? What do you have to do ? <p> # MARIA # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it . <p> Maria goes to hang a sheet . Blanca watches her a beat and then opens her purse and pulls something out . <p> # BLANCA # Maria ... Maria , look at me ! <p> Maria finally looks over . Blanca puts a GRAPE in her mouth . Maria stares at her in shock as she tries to swallow it . She gags and spits it out . <p> # MARIA # What the hell are you doing ? <p> # BLANCA # I 'm going to be a mule .

I already said yes . <p> Blanca looks trapped . Maria turns away , annoyed . <p> # MARIA # ... Do you know what you 're going to tell your family ? <p> # BLANCA # Do you ? <p> CUT TO : <p> INT . BEDROOM - EVENING <p> # JUANA # I do n't understand . You 're going all the way to Chiquinquira ? To work as a secretary ? <p> Juana stands in the doorway of Maria and Diana 's bedroom , watching as Maria folds clothes and puts them into a small suitcase . Diana sits on her own bed . <p> # MARIA # I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me again . <p> # MARIA # I got it through Blanca 's aunt . <p> # JUANA # But you do n't know anything about working in an office . <p> # MARIA # ( crossing away from her mother ) What , you do n't think I 'm smart enough ? <p> # JUANA # I did n't say that . <p> Juana sits at the foot of Maria 's bed . She glances to Diana , clearly distraught - then watches Maria continue to go through her clothes . <p> JUANA ( cont 'd ) I just do n't understand why you have to go so far away ... Maria ... <p> Maria finally looks at her mother . They share a beat . They both clearly feel uncomfortable , but Maria buries her uncertainty with a distant resolve . <p> EXT . PLAZA - MID-MORNING <p> Her hair pulled back and her face made up , Maria is dressed in a nice blouse and skirt - clearly her nicest outfit - as she walks down into town carrying her suitcase . <p> She sits on a bench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the center of the plaza and sees JUAN with his bicycle standing amongst friends . He turns and they make eye contact . After a moment of hesitation , he rides over . <p> # MARIA # ( stands , awkward ) Hi . <p> # JUAN # Hi . <p> # MARIA # How are you doing ? <p> # JUAN # Fine . You ? <p> # MARIA # OK . <p> Pause . <p> # JUAN # I need my tapes my back . <p> # MARIA # ... Sure . <p> She opens her walkman , ejects the tape and hands it him . Then she goes into her bag and pulls out a handful of tapes . She gives him all but one , which she puts back in her bag . <p> MARIA ( cont 'd ) ( beat ) Do you want the walkman back ? <p> # JUAN # That was a present . <p> They stare at each other . <p> JUAN ( CONT 'D ) You look nice . <p> # MARIA # Thanks . <p> Just then , FRANKLIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks enormously uncomfortable . Juan and Franklin look at each other but no-one makes any attempt at introductions . <p> # JUAN # ( finally ) I got ta go . <p> # MARIA # I 'll see you later . <p> Juan gets on his bike and rides off with the tapes in one hand . Maria watches him go . <p> # FRANKLIN # ( breaking her moment ) You ready ? <p> He gets her suitcase and puts it on the back of his motorcycle . Maria gives a final look at Juan as she climbs on . <p> EXT . MOVING MOTORCYCLE , COUNTRYSIDE AND CITY - CONTINUOUS <p> Franklin and Maria ride with Maria 's suitcase strapped to the back of the bike - along the road and then into the city . He weaves in and out of traffic and finally pulls over at ... <p> EXT. / INT . PHARMACY - CONTINUOUS <p> ... a perfectly ordinary pharmacy in the middle of the city . <p> Franklin accompanies Maria inside and nods hello to the PHARMACIST behind the counter . The pharmacist disappears into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # MARIA # And Blanca ? <p> # FRANKLIN # She 's in another place . <p> The sliding door-display case suddenly rolls open - revealing the pharmacist standing behind it expectantly . Franklin passes him Maria 's suitcase . <p> FRANKLIN ( CONT 'D ) ( reading her nervousness ) Do n't worry . Everything 's gon na be fine . <p> He gives her a kiss on the cheek . She hesitates before turning away from him and follows the pharmacist into the back . <p> INT . PHARMACY , BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS <p> The pharmacist leads Maria into a small , stark room with a table , a few chairs , a sink and a small bed in the corner . <p> At the other end of the table is a YOUNG MAN , in his 20s . He 's got various paraphernalia spread out in front of him : a BOX OF SEVERAL DOZEN RUBBER SURGICAL GLOVES , a pair of SCISSORS , a ROLL OF PLASTIC WRAP , a DIGITAL SCALE , a small box of DENTAL FLOSS , a BOTTLE OF SALAD OIL , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He transfers a precise amount of heroin from the scale into the severed finger of a latex glove , which he then places into a HAND-OPERATED PRESS , pumping the lever and packing it down into a dense one-inch capsule . <p> The pharmacist steps out of the room as Maria sits and watches the young man , entranced ... <p> SERIES OF JUMP CUTS : <p> He cuts the fingers off several of the rubber gloves . He then slides the heroin capsule into a rubber finger and packs it all the way down into the bottom . <p> He takes the finger full of heroin and stuffs it inside a second rubber finger - then another and another until it 's been buried in SIX LAYERS of rubber fingers . <p> He breaks off a piece of DENTAL FLOSS and ties it shut like a rubber balloon . He then trims off the excess dental floss and the excess rubber . <p> He sets the " pellet " down - a snug little thumb-sized package - and begins making another . <p> The pharmacist re-enters the room , breaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a cup of water . <p> # PHARMACIST # This will stop your bowels . <p> She puts the pills in her mouth and swallows them . The pharmacist then raises a bottle of RED LIQUID with a tube and an atomizer attached . <p> PHARMACIST ( cont 'd ) Open you mouth . <p> As he sprays the liquid into Maria 's throat , JAVIER steps in and sits down at the table with her . The pharmacist finishes and leaves the room . <p> Javier pulls the SMALL BOWL over to him and pours it full of SALAD OIL . He takes one of the pellets and dips it in the oil , completely covering it . <p> He passes it to Maria and she puts it in her mouth . She tries to swallow it but GAGS . <p> # JAVIER # Relax . <p> She puts the pellet back in her mouth and sets it deep in her throat with her fingers . <p> JAVIER ( CONT 'D ) Do n't put your fingers in so much . <p> Maria starts to gag again . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grapes ? <p> # MARIA # Yes . <p> # JAVIER # If you ca n't do this we 'll stop now . <p> # MARIA # No , really . I can do it . Just give me a second . <p> Maria looks nervous . She puts the pellet in her mouth and holds it there . <p> # JAVIER # Just let it slide down . <p> She tilts her head back and the pellet goes down . She looks very relieved . <p> # MARIA # See . <p> # JAVIER # Good . <p> He dips another pellet in oil and holds it out to her . <p> AN HOUR LATER - Maria paces around the room . The young man packs up his stuff as Maria and Javier continue to work . <p> JAVIER ( CONT 'D ) How do you feel ? <p> # MARIA # How many is it so far ? <p> # JAVIER # Twenty-three . <p> Maria presses her stomach . <p> JAVIER ( CONT 'D ) Here . Lay down on the bed . <p> She lays down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARIA # What are you doing ? ! <p> # JAVIER # They have to settle properly . <p> He massages her stomach , manipulating the pellets inside . The door opens and the PHARMACIST brings in a bowl of SOUP . <p> JAVIER ( CONT 'D ) Have some soup . <p> Maria gets up and sits at the table . She takes a spoonful of soup with great trepidation . It hurts going down . <p> # PHARMACIST # Do you want more anesthetic ? <p> Maria shakes her head No . Javier places another pellet in her bowl . She gets it on her spoon along with some soup and stares at it . <p> A FEW HOURS LATER - the room is illuminated by early afternoon light . Maria sits at the table with her head down . Javier is holding out a pellet . <p> # JAVIER # One more . <p> # MARIA # How many ? <p> # JAVIER # Sixty-two . Come on . <p> She stares at him hatefully before taking the pellet . She swallows it slowly but without gagging . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be right back . <p> He turns and leaves the room . <p> Maria takes a beat alone . She goes to her things and removes from her purse a toothbrush and a small tube of toothpaste . She goes to the sink and brushes her teeth . She rinses and spits and then catches sight of herself in the mirror . <p> Javier comes back in , sits at the table , and removes from his wallet a wad of AMERICAN MONEY - 20-dollar bills . She sits . <p> JAVIER ( CONT 'D ) ( hands her the money ) This is eight hundred dollars . <p> Maria stares at the money . Never in her life has she held this much . <p> JAVIER ( cont 'd ) When they ask you how much you 're coming to America with tell them eight hundred dollars . Just say you 've been saving up . ( handing her papers ) This is your ticket . Round trip - one week . This is your passport and visa . <p> She stares at them - fascinated . He writes something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> # MARIA # ( reads , mispronouncing ) Motor Lodge 46 . <p> # JAVIER # That 's the name and address of the hotel where you say you 're staying . Do you remember why you 're in America ? <p> # MARIA # I 'm on vacation . <p> # JAVIER # ( testing her ) And how long are you here for ? <p> # MARIA # One week . <p> # JAVIER # Who bought this ticket ? <p> # MARIA # A friend of mine . <p> # JAVIER # Where ? <p> # MARIA # At a travel agency on Plaza Bolivar . <p> # JAVIER # Where do you plan to stay in America ? <p> # MARIA # I 'm going to stay in a hotel . <p> # JAVIER # Which hotel ? <p> # MARIA # ( reading ) Motor Lodge 46 . <p> # JAVIER # Good . How are you feeling ? <p> # MARIA # Like hungry but full - it 's weird . <p> # JAVIER # You can drink on the plane but do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't talk to anyone on the plane . Even the stewardesses spy for the DEA . Once you 've been passed through Customs you 'll come out through an electric sliding door . On the other side of that there 'll be someone there to meet you . <p> # MARIA # How will I know who it is ? <p> # JAVIER # They 'll know you . If they 're not there for some reason call this number . <p> He takes back the paper and writes a TELEPHONE NUMBER on it . <p> JAVIER ( CONT 'D ) The key is to stay calm and act like nothing 's wrong . But if you do get caught just keep quiet . ( he leans in ) If you give them any information we 'll leave you to rot in there while we go to your house and have a chat with your grandmother , your mother , your sister ... and little Pachito . Same thing if any of what 's in your stomach disappears along the way . ( MORE ) <p> JAVIER ( CONT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those 62 pellets you 've got weighs . Do I make myself clear ? <p> He glares into her eyes . The effect is chilling . <p> INT . AIRPORT , X-RAY CHECK POINT - AFTERNOON <p> Maria puts her purse on the conveyor belt and steps through the metal detector . One guard scans her up and down with HANDHELD METAL DETECTOR and another then pats her down . As Maria stares straight ahead she suddenly sees something odd : BLANCA - dressed vampy with cleavage and lipstick - browsing perfume at the duty-free shop . They make brief eye contact . <p> CUT TO : <p> INT . AIRPLANE CABIN - LATER <p> Maria gazes out the window as the plane picks up speed . She crosses herself and mutters a Hail Mary . She closes her eyes as her back is pressed up against the seatback and the plane becomes airborne . For the first time in her life , she is off the surface of the planet , flying . She stares out and watches with fascination as the world shrinks away below her . <p> CUT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off with a soft CHIME . <p> The woman next to her ( Carolina ) undoes her seat belt and gets up . <p> Maria looks over at the people on the other side of the aisle . When she looks forward she is surprised to see LUCY getting up and making her way to the aisle . <p> Maria unbuckles her seatbelt and then approaches Lucy , who is getting a pillow and a blanket out of the overhead bin . <p> # MARIA # ( hushed ) I did n't know you were going again . <p> # LUCY # I did n't either . It just happened . <p> # MARIA # You know we 're not the only ones . <p> # LUCY # That 's how it works . They send a bunch of us so if one gets stopped it makes it easier for the rest to slip through ... <p> # MARIA # Oh ... <p> A STEWARDESS suddenly passes behind them . They are both immediately silent . Lucy moves back to her seat . <p> CUT TO : <p> Maria looks through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Disneyland , a photograph of a businessman in a chic office ... and then the MAP OF THE WORLD with all of the airline 's flight paths indicated . <p> The DINNER CART is maneuvered slowly down the aisle . Carolina pulls her airplane headphones out of one ear . <p> # CAROLINA # It 's about time . I 'm starved . <p> The stewardess approaches . <p> # STEWARDESS # Chicken or beef ? <p> # CAROLINA # Chicken . <p> # STEWARDESS # For you ? <p> # MARIA # ... Chicken , please . <p> The stewardess turns to get the trays . <p> # STEWARDESS # Here you are . <p> And now Maria finds herself staring at a perfectly delicious looking tray of steaming hot food . The woman next to her unwraps her fork and decides to strike up conversation . <p> # CAROLINA # Do you go to the United States a lot ? <p> # MARIA # Well ... <p> Maria cuts off a piece of chicken and puts it in her mouth . She chews but does n't swallow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> # CAROLINA # I go every year to visit my daughter . She married an American and they 've got a beautiful house on Long Island . Of course , I think the children should be the ones to come to Colombia to visit their grandmother instead of the other way around ... <p> The woman TALKS and TALKS - oblivious to whether Maria is in fact eating or not . <p> Maria carefully spits her food out into her napkin . <p> CUT TO : <p> LATER - <p> Maria is reaching up playing with the buttons and nozzles - trying to figure out how to control the air . The seats next to her are empty . <p> Suddenly , BLANCA is standing in the aisle . She looks over her shoulder and quickly sits down in the empty seat next to Maria . <p> # MARIA # What the hell are you doing ? <p> # BLANCA # I saw you talking to that woman before . Who was she ? <p> # MARIA # ( hesitates ) She 's ... you know ... <p> # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward and spots a woman ( CONSTANZA ) sitting one row back on the aisle . <p> BLANCA ( cont 'd ) I met her before , through Franklin .

The cabin lights are dimmed , the in-flight movie playing . Maria wakes up . Carolina has fallen asleep with her headphones on . <p> Maria lifts her shirt and presses her abdomen in discomfort . She unbuttons her pants trying to relieve the pressure . <p> She climbs over Carolina and moves to the aisle . CONSTANZA looks up at her as she passes . <p> INT . AIRPLANE LAVATORY CONTINUOUS <p> Maria locks the LAVATORY door and the lights come on . She pulls down her pants and sits on the toilet . As she contorts her face we hear the TINKLE of urine on metal . <p> INT . AIRPLANE CABIN - CONTINUOUS <p> LUCY is sweating profusely , still dabbing herself with a napkin . She does n't look well . She gets up and maneuvers to the aisle . <p> INT . LAVATORY - CONTINUOUS <p> Sitting on the toilet , Maria suddenly has a look of PANIC in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> IN THE PLANE CABIN - Lucy walks slowly down the aisle . She sees Blanca . The two of them lock eyes , but Lucy keeps walking . <p> IN THE LAVATORY - Maria holds her hand under cold water in the sink . She 's rinsing off TWO PELLETS . <p> She opens her purse and removes her tube of TOOTHPASTE . <p> PLANE CABIN - Lucy comes to the back of the plane and waits by the lavatory , looking sicker all the time . <p> LAVATORY - Maria squeezes toothpaste onto the second pellet , smears it on and takes a beat . She puts the pellet in her mouth , tilts her head back and swallows . She then looks at herself in the mirror and tries to compose herself . <p> PLANE CABIN - Maria comes out of the lavatory , face to face with LUCY . Lucy looks desperate - sweating , nervous . <p> # LUCY # I do n't feel well . <p> # MARIA # What are you going to do ? <p> Lucy has a blank , nervous look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calm down . As soon as we arrive we 're going to get you to a doctor . You 're going to be fine . <p> # LUCY # ( pulling it together ) I know . I know . ( beat ) Thanks . <p> Maria heads back up the aisle - past Blanca - to her seat , casting a glance over her shoulder as she sits . <p> CUT TO : <p> The STEWARDESS works her way down the aisle with a stack of YELLOW CUSTOMS CARDS . She gives them to Maria and Carolina . <p> Maria reads the card and gets to a blank space for an ADDRESS where she plans to stay in the U.S. She reaches into her pocket for the paper with the name of the hotel but she ca n't find it . She searches all her pockets and then in her purse but the paper is nowhere . <p> She looks over to copy her neighbor 's answer but Carolina finishes writing and tucks the card away . <p> Maria gets up and walks forward to the middle Emergency Exit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse , notices Maria and gets concerned . She glances over her shoulder , gets up and makes her way over to Maria . <p> LUCY ( cont 'd ) ( hushed ) I 've been thinking about telling the stewardess I 'm sick . They could get me a doctor . <p> # MARIA # But you 'll end up in jail once they find out what 's wrong with you . <p> # LUCY # But I 'll be alive . <p> # MARIA # ( hesitates ) Do n't .

Lucy meanwhile touches up her make-up trying to hide how sick she is . Maria looks out her window playing nervously with the crucifix on her necklace . <p> INT . AIRPORT CORRIDORS - NIGHT <p> Lucy comes off the plane amid Constanza and other passengers . Maria walks down the same corridor . Blanca follows Maria . <p> INT . BAGGAGE CLAIM / CUSTOMS AREA - CONTINUOUS <p> Maria stands by a large baggage carousel with other passengers from the plane . She spots Blanca and Constanza at various points across from her . Lucy stands about ten feet away from her - looking sick but doing her best to keep her nerves under control . <p> There are about FIFTEEN CUSTOMS INSPECTORS across the room - men and women - looking bored , talking among themselves as they wait for passengers to come through . <p> Bags tumble down the chute - some huge , some swathed in plastic wrap . They get clogged on the carousel . Three AIRPORT BAGGAGE HANDLERS unknot them . Passengers struggle to pull their luggage off and head through Customs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if waiting for a second bag . <p> Lucy pulls a SMALL RED SUITCASE off . She looks at Maria - and then steps to the short line by the first two inspectors . <p> Maria looks down but there 's no sign of her suitcase . <p> Lucy - nervous and sick - hands her yellow card to the inspector . He gives her a quick look and waves her through . <p> Everyone breathes a sigh of relief . <p> Lucy makes eye contact with Maria from the other side - and then passes outside through a sliding electric door . <p> Constanza steps up to an inspector . The inspector asks her something and then points to the secondary inspection point . She looks mortified as she takes her bag over to be checked . <p> Blanca sees this , takes her bag and proceeds directly to Customs . Maria looks desperate for her bag to come around . <p> Blanca gets at the end of the line at Customs . At last , Maria grabs her bag off the carousel . She begins to move toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a roaming INSPECTOR - a tall man with a buzz cut . <p> # INSPECTOR # ( in English ) Hello .

The inspector puts on a pair of RUBBER GLOVES , opens it up and begins to check its contents , piling up Maria 's clothes . <p> Throughout , the inspector invokes a strangely casual , friendly tone . <p> INSPECTOR ( CONT 'D ) What 's the purpose of your stay ? <p> # MARIA # Vacation . <p> # INSPECTOR # How long will you be here ? <p> # MARIA # One week . <p> The inspector feels all the sides of the suitcase . <p> A SECOND INSPECTOR - a Latina woman - walks up and watches as the first agent continues his inspection . <p> # INSPECTOR # Only a week ? No more ? <p> # MARIA # No . <p> # INSPECTOR # Where will you be staying ? <p> # MARIA # ... With my friend . <p> # INSPECTOR # Where does your friend live ? <p> The inspector finds a pair of shoes and checks the soles - bending them , looking closely at the heels . <p> Maria looks beyond him , at the opposite counter , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piled up . <p> INSPECTOR ( CONT 'D ) ( looking up , repeating ) Where does your friend live ? <p> # MARIA # New York . <p> # INSPECTOR # Is she coming to pick you up today ? <p> # MARIA # ...

INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS <p> The male inspector and female inspector lead Maria into a sterile , little room - about eight by eight - bare except for the counter and a wooden BENCH . The female inspector stands behind her . <p> FEMALE INSPECTOR #2 Place your hands on the wall ... Higher ... Open your legs ... Do n't take your hands off the wall . <p> Maria does as she says . The inspector pats Maria down - the arms , the back , the breasts , stomach , crotch , and legs , front and back . <p> FEMALE INSPECTOR #2 ( CONT 'D ) Please , have a seat . <p> Maria sits down on the bench . <p> # INSPECTOR # Give me both your shoes , please . <p> Maria does as he says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one with a sharp awl as the Female Inspector continues questioning Maria . <p> FEMALE INSPECTOR #2 Maria Alvarez .

Are you carrying drugs in your stomach ? <p> # MARIA # No . <p> FEMALE INSPECTOR #2 ( beat ) I want you to prove it to me . I want you to take an X-ray . <p> She stares at Maria but Maria does n't flinch . She then goes to the counter and takes a sheet of paper from a stack . <p> FEMALE INSPECTOR #2 ( CONT 'D ) Please sign this document permitting us to perform an X-ray . <p> She gives Maria the form . <p> # MARIA # I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in three languages . <p> Maria reads the form , takes a beat and then signs it ( printing her name like a child ) . The inspectors watch her carefully . <p> INSPECTOR ( CONT 'D ) ( playing the good cop ) Maria , listen , I 'm going to be straight with you . If we do this X-ray and you 're carrying drugs then we 're going to see it immediately . In that case it would be much , much better to tell us now . That way we can tell the judge you cooperated and you 'll get less time in jail . <p> FEMALE INSPECTOR #2 If you make us take the X-ray and you are carrying then you 'll get ten years in prison .

MEDICAL FACILITY - MAIN AREA <p> Maria sits in a corridor waiting . <p> A door opens . CONSTANZA steps out followed by another inspector who sits her down opposite Maria . <p> The two of them stare at each other . Constanza 's eyes are puffy and red . She 's clearly been crying . <p> Through the open door , Maria can see in a white-coated TECHNICIAN examining an X-ray with another inspector . He takes out a pen and points to something . There are scores of pellets clearly visible in Constanza 's stomach and intestines . <p> The inspector takes the X-ray and walks over to Constanza . He handcuffs Constanza and leads her down the hall . <p> Maria looks absolutely petrified . Thirty feet away the two inspectors that accompanied her are discussing something with another white-coated technician . They turn and look at Maria and shake their heads - something is wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IN ENGLISH . <p> FEMALE INSPECTOR #2 ( in English ) What do you think ... ? <p> # INSPECTOR # ( in English ) Given the circumstances ... ? <p> Maria tries to glean what they 're saying .

And does he know you swallowed drugs ? <p> # MARIA # But I didn't. ( beat ) I 'm not carrying drugs . I 'm just here to see my sister . I have n't seen her in four years ... I swear . <p> The inspectors stare at each other trying to make a decision . <p> INT . AIRPORT ARRIVALS TERMINAL - LATER <p> Maria steps through the sliding door and into the waiting area with her suitcase . There are a small number of people waiting on the side of the ropes . Maria walks slowly through them , scanning the crowd for her contact . No-one approaches her . <p> EXT . AIRPORT TERMINAL - CONTINUOUS <p> Maria carries her bag out to the curb to look around .

He drags her into the street where a VAN is waiting . He opens the sliding door , throws her inside and slams the door shut behind her . <p> INT . VAN - CONTINUOUS <p> Totally spun around , Maria finds herself sitting next to LUCY and BLANCA . There are TWO GUYS ( CARLOS and WILSON ) in the front - they look very YOUNG , not more than 20 , and have a very nervous quality . <p> # CARLOS # ( to Maria ) What happened to the other one ? <p> # MARIA # They arrested her . <p> # CARLOS # Fuck ! <p> Wilson starts the engine and pulls away fast . Maria looks at Lucy , clearly ill , and then at Blanca . <p> INT . HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS ( NIGHT ) <p> The door opens - Wilson enters and flips on the light .

She glances at Wilson . <p> Lucy sits on the chair and takes a deep breath . <p> Without blinking , Wilson clicks the remote a few times and lands on something else : a news report ( in Spanish ) about crowds of people flocking to see an apparition of the Virgin on the side of a tree . As the news report ends , Wilson crosses himself , kisses his crucifix and tucks it under his shirt . <p> Blanca crosses the room , causing Maria to notice that Lucy has dozed off sitting up . <p> # MARIA # Lucy ! Lucy ! LUCY ! ! ! ! <p> INT . HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER <p> In the bathroom , Maria holds Lucy 's head under COLD WATER in the bathtub .

Maria sits up a little , rubs her eyes and refocuses . <p> And in another snippet of MARIA 'S POV - we see the two guys carrying Lucy , ARGUING in a panicked whisper as they leave the hotel room and shut the door behind them . <p> Maria is totally unsure of what she 's seen in her half-sleeping-state . She sits up in bed . The room is strangely quiet - the two guys are gone , Lucy is gone . Only Blanca lies next to her asleep . She gets up and goes to the bathroom ... <p> INT . HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS ( MORNING ) <p> Maria treads cautiously into the bathroom and then stops cold in her tracks .

MOVING CAR , PULASKI SKYWAY - CONTINUOUS <p> Maria stares out the window at New Jersey factories and refineries . It looks entirely different from her pastoral homeland - gray and dark and forbidding . <p> Blanca clutches her MATCHBOOK - everything about her feels guarded and angry . The driver is having a conversation in CREOLE on his cell phone ( apparently talking to himself as he speaks into a headset ) . He finishes and looks in the rear-view mirror . <p> # DRIVER # ( in English ) You just arrive in the United States ... ?

If you smoke it 's like giving a cigarette to your baby . <p> She fiddles with the knobs on one of the monitors , and begins to pass the hand unit over Maria 's belly . <p> DOCTOR ( CONT 'D ) Let 's see . <p> A confusion of gray dots comes onto the screen . <p> DOCTOR ( CONT 'D ) At this stage of the pregnancy you 'll be able to see the entire fetus .

Maria sits up , buttoning her top button . The doctor hands her the print .

And my sister was asking me , Hey how 's America ? Is it wonderful ? How is your job ? ' And she 's talking about how much she wants to come and be with me . And all I wanted was to tell them how much I missed them and how hard it was here , but then I thought , Who am I to complain about how hard life is here ? <p> But it gets better , trust me ... The best moment of my life here - was when I got my first paycheck . Oh my god . I will never forget going into that office and sending money home for the first time . You have no idea .

She leaves some of it on the table and hands some to don Fernando . <p> # MARIA # And that 's to send Lucy back to Colombia ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes in . Don Fernando looks over at him . <p> # DON FERNANDO # ( to Maria ) Excuse me , child . <p> Don Fernando and the mortician step out together , leaving Maria alone . She looks around the room at the display cases full of urns , etc. - with prices tags . <p> Maria collects her purse , gets up and makes her way up the hall and into the viewing room for a final look and sees ... <p> INT . VIEWING ROOM , FUNERAL HOME - CONTINUOUS <p> CARLA and PABLO standing by the casket . Maria stays by the door , mute . Carla crosses herself at the casket , crying . As she turns toward Pablo , she catches sight of Maria . <p> # MARIA # ( explaining herself ) I 'm sorry . I did n't mean to upset you . I just wanted to say goodbye to Lucy . I 'm going back to Colombia ... <p> Carla gazes back at Lucy . <p> # CARLA # ( slowly ) She looks beautiful . <p> Indeed , Carla has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> CARLA ( cont 'd ) ... I do n't understand why she never said anything ... We grew so far apart ... <p> Maria watches Carla mourn . She does n't dare to say anything . <p> INT . MOVING CAR - DAY <p> Maria sits , trancelike , in the back of a moving car-service car gazing at the Manhattan skyline in the distance . Blanca sits across from her . Maria looks down at the PRINTOUT of her sonogram and the REMINDER CARD for her next check-up . <p> EXT . AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY <p> The driver lifts Maria 's and Blanca 's suitcases out of the trunk along with a large SHOPPING BAG full of Blanca 's new purchases . <p> INT . AIRPORT TERMINAL - WAITING AREA - CONTINUOUS <p> Maria sits in the waiting area by the gate . She looks at all the other people waiting - and then at Blanca who goes through the bag of gifts she 's bringing home . <p> AT THE GATE - <p> Maria stands behind Blanca in line to get on the flight . They advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the passageway . <p> The gate attendant puts out her hand for Maria 's boarding pass but Maria lets the person behind her go ahead . <p> # MARIA # Blanca ... <p> Blanca turns . <p> Maria stares at her , looking for words . They share a moment of understanding . <p> And then Maria turns slowly away from the gate . <p> The camera holds on her as she walks through the terminal , pensive . The sounds of the airport around her begin to drop away . <p> Bit by bit , a certain relief takes over . Her gaze rises as she walks - step by step leaving her past behind , looking forward . <p> Maria moves ahead . A subtle but undeniable flicker of determination in her eyes . <p> FADE OUT
