We 've crunched the numbers , we 've colored the bar graphs , we 've drawn the pie charts . Everybody suspected all along that the Clippers were the worst team  --  whom are we kidding ?  --  but nobody , until now , had ever bothered to certify their chronic incompetence with actual arithmetic . So taking what was long just a kind of folklore of futility , we 've done the dispiriting dirty work and can now confirm it : Among franchises in the four major professional sports , the Clippers are the most inept ever . // Agreed , this is a horrible thing to announce  --  as if the Clippers , and whoever their fans might be , need to be discouraged any further . We like to accentuate the positive in pro sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer any overlooking this magnitude of unrelieved desperation . In their 22 seasons in Southern California the Clippers have won barely one third of their games ( chart , page 58 ) . Since leaving Buffalo in 1978 ( where , as the Braves , they were pretty bad too ) , the Clippers , either in San Diego or Los Angeles , have had just two winning seasons . They 've been to the playoffs only three times . They 've had 13 coaching changes . A dozen last-place finishes in the Pacific Division . A brief flirtation , in 1997-98 , at the Philadelphia 76ers ' record-low nine wins in a season . ( L.A. finished 17-65. ) // When it comes to protracted prostration , there 's never been anything like it . Other franchises have endured disastrous spells , have even become catchphrases for failure . The NFL 's New Orleans Saints come to mind , a team that slogged through 12 consecutive losing seasons in the 1960s and ' 70s , its fans wearing paper bags over their heads in shame . But even the Ain'ts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bay Buccaneers had a nice ( bad ) stretch , but they still reached a pair of NFC championship games . The Minnesota Timberwolves seemed capable of challenging the Clippers , but back-to-back playoff appearances  --  and Kevin Garnett  --  effectively removed them from the noncompetition. // Even franchises that played so badly as to conjure embarrassment at their very mentions have all gained redemption , the Clippers excepted . For sports fans of a certain age , the New York Mets will always signify comic incapacity . Their first seasons , to this day , remain a cautionary tale for any expansion team owner . Yet the Mets overcame that floundering and bumbling beginning to become a championship team , and in relatively short order . If you recall , they were amazin ' . // Really , scant few teams have n't enjoyed at least a dead-cat bounce after alarming declines . The Denver Nuggets kept the Clippers out of Jay Leno 's monologues in 1997-98 , when they too chased the 76ers ' nine-victory mark . But the Nuggets did n't make it either and , worse for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clippers , after that brief respite from ridicule , rebounded in reverse : The very next season they almost broke the Nuggets ' and Vancouver Grizzlies ' mark of 23 consecutive losses , dropping their first 17 games , and , in a nice bit of self-mockery , appeared on Leno to celebrate their near-epic failure . // There are other cities where the fans like to characterize themselves as " long suffering , " but none can bemoan a losing lineage as extensive as L.A 's . A ground ball through Bill Buckner 's legs may indeed be the work of the gods . Where the Clippers come from , however , it 's just an E-3 . Fate might define a team in some instances , but only in those in which a grounder through the legs ( or its basketball equivalent ) is not an everyday occurrence . In any case , Buckner 's Boston Red Sox were in a World Series in 1986 when destiny reared its ugly head . The World Series ! Against the Mets ! // The Clippers , with their sustained flair for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their helplessness , so practiced and so dependable , is clearly the work of man , possibly the work of just one man  --  we 're thinking of Donald Sterling here ( page 60 )  --  although surely no owner could weave a web of defeat like this all by himself . It 's more probably a team effort , each man doing his worst , nobody 's hand really on the wheel . // Their winning percentage drifts ever lower , no redemption in sight . They win 20% of their games in one season ( ' 97-98 ) , 18% the next . Lottery picks every year and the ineptitude continues , virtually uninterrupted . And somehow the team continues to exist . There normally is this refuge in seasonal sports : the idea that there is always next year . But the Clippers seem to refute the notion that there is always reason to hope , always a possibility of success . Having earned only nine victories in last year 's strike-shortened season , the team was nevertheless optimistic about its chances this year . Really . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverted to form , with all that entails ( a coaching change , players ' promising defections , a secure hold on last place ) , oddly at peace with their destiny . // Part of the problem is that as awful as they may be , they are not especially clownish . They might reasonably have almost the same expectation of victory as , say , the Washington Generals , yet they are unmistakably playing professional basketball . Often with genuine professional basketball players . Pretty often , anyway . On a recent night one Clipper , inbounding the ball , absentmindedly began dribbling up-court from his sideline position , cutting out the middle man . But such comical gaffes are rare . The Clippers ' record might be easier to take ( certainly easier to explain ) if they really were clowns , performing one pratfall after another . But watching them play , you are struck with the indescribably sad thought : They really are trying ! // It can get a little poignant , too , when you realize that a college player who 's known nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he 's known it ) will be plunged into the Clippers ' black hole of defeat , sucked into a despair that is unrelenting , quite possibly life-changing . There 's karmic comedy for you  --  a player becomes the best in the nation just so that he might play for the worst in the world . Sometimes it 's not so funny , though . Bo Kimble , the Clippers ' No. 1 draft choice in 1990 , recently told the Los Angeles Times that he was nearly driven to suicide by the team 's habitual underachieving . ( To be fair , the executives who signed off on his selection and watched him flop still have to rush past open windows themselves. ) // Free agency being what it is , though , most prospects can engineer an escape and return to a more competitive world with a portion of their self-esteem and earning power intact . ( See Danny Manning , Loy Vaught . ) For the players , the humiliation is only temporary . For the franchise , it is unending . // Since it now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are steadfastly improvement-proof , to the point where their condition must be considered permanent ( look at the numbers , man ! )  --  it becomes important to assign meaning to such ongoing catastrophe . There 's got to be meaning to a failure of such immensity , else this world would be too frightening to live in . So , consider this : The Clippers must lose so we can be reminded that there is n't always a light at the end of the tunnel , there is n't necessarily redemption and there might not be a next year . // It 's a gloomy lesson , but if it prevents us from taking comfort in our calamity , from presuming success is the natural order of life , from counting on a cosmic corrective  --  well , then the Clippers have been instructive . Remember as you meander through your own life , your hand not quite on the wheel : It really can get worse than this .                    @
