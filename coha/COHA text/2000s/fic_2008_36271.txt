A good day at work typically left Faye Longchamp covered in sweat , rain , dust , dirt , or mud , depending on weather conditions . A more tedious day at work found her sitting in climate-controlled space , clean and comfortable , surrounded by very dirty things . This , unfortunately , had been one of those tedious days . <p> Faye knew that real archaeology was only just beginning when she hauled an artifact out of the ground . If that artifact was n't cleaned and measured and expertly described , then digging it up had been a waste of time . When Faye was in the right frame of mind , she enjoyed this painstaking work . Today , however , the early evening air outside was light and balmy , as April air in Florida tended to be . <p> Faye was having trouble staying indoors . <p> Not that she could see or feel that April air , because she was sitting in a basement , a rare activity in a part of the world where the groundwater is often so shallow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Careful planning and a great deal of money had gone into the design of this house , sunk into a low bluff overlooking the cerulean Gulf of Mexico . There are n't so many bluffs-low or otherwise-in Florida , so a great deal of money had gone into acquiring the land , too . Fortunately , her boss had cash to burn . <p> The tiny windows in Faye 's basement laboratory were well above eye-level , but the room 's atmosphere stopped short of being depressing . Its walls were a bright cheery yellow and the stainless steel sink gleamed , because Faye 's boss cut no corners on her work space . Thinking of Douglass as her boss always made Faye smile . The word " boss " did n't begin to cover what Douglass Everett was to her . Friend , role model , father figure-those words came closer , but language fails in matters of the heart . <p> Douglass was mightily proud of Faye 's accomplishments . He had sat up so many nights reading the papers she wrote for her graduate archaeology classes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Though he had risen from the humblest beginnings to his present status as the richest man in Micco County , Douglass never stopped thinking of himself as the son of a poor black sharecropper . Earning an honors diploma from a white high school in 1964 had been proof enough of his intellect and determination but , oh , how proud he would be to earn a college degree . <p> Faye decided , without consulting him , that a university education would be the perfect retirement project for her friend Douglass . <p> She hit the intercom button . " You busy ? " <p> " Just correcting the grammar on your lithics paper . " <p> " Leave my grammar alone . It 's fine just the way it is . But I 'm really lonely down here in this yellow cave . " <p> The intercom did n't answer her , but she could hear leather-soled shoes thumping down the basement stairs . Those footsteps were heavier than they 'd been just a year ago . It hurt Faye to think her friend was getting old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuasive speech as soon as she saw his face . <p> " It 's time for you to go back to school . " <p> The man 's salt-and-pepper eyebrows headed for his hairline . " The museum needs my attention . " <p> She noticed that he did n't say that he did n't want to go to school . <p> " You 're the kind of man who needs a whole slew of projects to keep himself occupied . If you try to do just one thing , you 'll dry up and get old . You need to keep busy . " <p> " I 'm retired . In case you have n't noticed . " <p> " The museum will survive . You 've got good employees . I 'll make sure they get the tickets taken . Everything will be fine . " Douglass ' Museum of American Slavery was hardly more than a rich man 's hobby , funded by the considerable fortune he had earned with his construction company . Still , he spared no expense in making sure the exhibits accurately told the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after European contact and ending with the Emancipation Proclamation . Faye just wished more visitors walked through the museum 's doors . She 'd been working on getting the place some publicity , though , so the museum was no reason for Douglass to pass up the chance to go to school . <p> Faye knew her friend would cut a wide swathe through campus in the same way he 'd conquered every other obstacle that life had thrown him . " I ca n't wait to see you in class . You 'll be busting bell curves and making undergrads cry . Really , you 're paying me more than enough to take care of things while you do something for yourself . " <p> He did n't say no . <p> It was so good to spend time with Douglass again . It was even better just to be at home . Faye was overjoyed to be back in her beloved gulf islands for a semester . She had procured funding to work on a tiny islet deep in the Last Isles , excavating the remains of the Turkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior to the hotel 's destruction in an 1856 hurricane . The hotel site was a short boat ride from her home on Joyeuse Island , so this home-based project gave her the chance to personally manage the ongoing restoration of her cherished two-hundred-year-old house , also known as Joyeuse . And in her spare time , she pointed her skiff toward shore and tied it to Douglass ' beautiful new dock , so that she could sit in this lab and catalog treasures . Since Faye thrived on work , she had never been happier . <p> * * * <p> Faye 's squawk distracted Douglass from the paper in his hand . <p> " You hurt ? " he asked . <p> " Nope . But would you take a look at this ? " <p> While pulling a particularly filthy find from its cleaning solution , she had noticed specks of a color that was not dirt-brown . It was green , her favorite color . It was the color of the live oaks that overhung her home . It was the color of the Gulf of Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anxious to remove the encrusted soil without scratching its surface . Flabbergasted , she watched as an emerald 's crystalline facets emerged . She held it in her fingers and its grassy color contrasted with the warm brown of her skin . <p> The stone was huge , as emeralds go . For some reason , the pure green light reflecting off its surface made her think of the fruit that grew , uncultivated , all over Joyeuse Island . It was the size and shape of a scuppernong grape or a wild plum . Faye , who had never before craved jewelry , felt an unreasoning need to possess this luminous thing . <p> Because the urge to keep it to herself was so strong , she handed it to Douglass , while she still could . The light in his brown eyes said that he , too , was drawn to its beauty . <p> He held it up . Light shattered on its surface , flinging green sparks around the room . <p> " I 'll give you credit for this much , Faye . When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> * * * <p> Faye 's work day had effectively ended when she cleaned the dirt off a priceless emerald . Since then , she and Douglass had accomplished exactly nothing . Not unless you counted fruitless speculation about what a treasure like that was doing underground on Joyeuse Island , in Faye 's own back yard . <p> " It 's not too hard to guess who wore it , " Faye pointed out . " My family only had money for one generation before the Civil War wiped them out . I 'm talking about the European branch of the family tree . The African branch never had any money at all . The shape and ornate gold setting-what 's left of the setting-suggest that it would have been the pendant in a grand necklace . " <p> Douglass squinted at the stone 's setting , as if he wondered how it was made . " It certainly does n't look like something a man would have worn . " <p> " In my family 's one wealthy generation , there were only two free women on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Carole LaFourche . Since I think we can presume that none of the slave women ever wore this thing , it had to be one of them . " <p> " Then I guess it 's yours . " <p> " I feel like it belongs in a museum . Fortunately , you 've got one handy . " <p> Douglass rolled the bauble around on his palm . " Before you give your treasure away , why do n't you sleep on the idea ? " <p> " I could n't sleep with something that valuable in my house . And I hate to leave it here for you to worry about . " <p> Douglass inclined his head toward a walk-in safe . " I got that thing so I would n't have to worry about my stuff . Leave it here until you decide what to do . " <p> * * * <p> As Faye gathered her things to go home , she reflected that the reporter had come a week too soon . Six months of nagging phone calls from Faye had finally persuaded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Douglass ' museum . She was afraid the man had been disappointed by its lack of flashy displays . <p> The sexiest artifact Faye had been able to show him was an engraved silver hip flask . The reporter had photographed Douglass holding the flask , knowing that it would be interesting to his readers because it was marked with a real person 's name-an old-fashioned name , Jedediah Bachelder-because it was made from a precious metal , and because it had once held liquor . <p> Faye had tried to call his attention to other more significant artifacts-a broken hoe left behind by a long-ago field hand or a shattered pot of African design-but he 'd had a magpie 's eye for shiny stuff . Only the silver hip flask held his interest . After snapping its photograph , he 'd gone on his merry way . This emerald would have impressed him a heckuva lot more . <p> " How old do you think this thing is ? " Douglass was still fondling the emerald . <p> " Judging from the old-fashioned cut , I 'd say it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting 's broken , but it looks about the same age . Mariah and Carole were n't around that long ago , but that does n't mean they never wore this emerald . It just means that it was n't new when they bought it . Or maybe Carole inherited it . I do n't know anything about Carole 's family , but it 's for certain sure that Mariah 's father never bought her a priceless emerald . " <p> Faye bent down to rifle through a box full of her field notebooks , then another . Victorious , she pulled out the one documenting the find , saying , " I need to refresh my memory on where I found this baby . Maybe it has brothers . " <p> " Maybe they 're already here , " Douglass says , gesturing at all the artifacts yet to be cleaned . <p> " That may be , " Faye says , " but you keep your hands off . If you want your museum to be taken seriously , we have to do things right . " <p> * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palm . He was still laughing , an hour after she left , at the bossy angle of Faye 's head as she told him to keep his hands off her precious artifacts . He knew better than to try his luck at amateur archaeology . He had learned long ago that it was worth the money to hire smart , competent people . That was why he kept Faye around . <p> Well , he also kept her around because she fussed over him like the daughter he and Emma had never had . And every now and then , she let him fuss over her , although she remained remarkably resistant to letting him give her things . She continued to let him pay her a nice little salary , but only because she knew she earned it . <p> Sometimes , he fancied that she looked like the daughter he and his wife should have had . She wore her hair cropped short like Emma , but her glossy and straight black locks looked nothing like his wife 's soft , tight curls . Faye 's determined jawline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was due less to genetics than to sheer , stubborn cussedness . And he and Faye both had cussedness to spare . <p> He felt in his pocket for the cigar that he was saving for this moment , when neither Faye nor Emma was around to fuss at him for tainting his lungs . Retirement gave a man so few opportunities to do things that met with his womenfolk 's disapproval . <p> A noise at the top of the stairs told him that Emma had finally come home from her regular Saturday-night bridge party . There would be no cigar tonight . <p> " I 'm down here ! " he called out , holding the emerald up to the light and knowing how much his wife would appreciate this rarity that Faye had dug up . Maybe Emma would like some emeralds . He 'd never bought her any , not that he could remember . <p> The footsteps on the stairs were loud and hurried , which was n't like Emma . Maybe if she 'd been the kind of woman who drank while she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ladylike as it always was . He rose from his chair . " Emma ? Are you okay ? " <p> Another set of footsteps and a deep voice told him that he and Emma had an uninvited guest . " Shit . There 's somebody down there . I thought you saw two cars leave . Shit . " Clattering footfalls echoed down the staircase . <p> This was a most inopportune time to be balancing a fortune on his palm . <p> At least two sets of footsteps rushed down the basement steps toward him . The building inspector had approved the room 's small , high windows as " emergency escapes , " but Douglass knew he could never haul himself out before the intruders arrived . Nor could he leave Emma to a stranger 's mercy . For the first time , he wondered if she were even home . He prayed she was still trumping her partner 's aces . He 'd presumed the first footsteps were hers , but he 'd never heard her speak . All he knew was that here were at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more . <p> His fist closed over the emerald . He needed to hide it , but the safe mocked him from across the room . It might as well be a million miles away . <p> With an odd pang of relief , he watched two men , and only two men , clad in dark clothing barrel into the room . Emma was n't here . Knowing she was safe gave him the strength to face this danger alone . <p> Chapter Two Faye piloted her skiff over the dark waters of the Gulf of Mexico , enjoying this late-night ride home . The silhouette of her beloved island blotted out a sweep of stars near the horizon , and its dark looming shape left her perfectly happy . <p> Her entire self was bound up in that island . Her African-American ancestors had been slaves there . They had built the glorious mansion for their masters ... who were also her ancestors . And before that the island had been held by a succession of Native American tribes . Her romantic imagination insisted that the Creek were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since her **35;1526;TOOLONG was half-Creek , imagining them on her island just enhanced her sense of ownership . And since her best friend Joe was mostly Creek , it gave them both a blood connection to their island home , and to each other . <p> When her cell phone rang , she was almost nostalgic for the days when she could n't afford one . <p> " Faye . " <p> Emma 's voice was quiet and terrible . Faye cut the motor so she could hear her better . <p> " Douglass is in the hospital . He 's in critical condition . He- " <p> Knowing full well that she should n't interrupt a woman with a voice so full of devastation , Faye could n't help herself . " What happened ? I just left him . He had a heart attack , did n't he ? Or a stroke . " <p> Faye remembered his heavy tread on the staircase . She should have stayed with him until Emma got home . <p> " Faye ? " Emma 's voice interrupted her dark thoughts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no heart attack . Somebody beat him , somebody that wanted him dead . From the look of him , I think they thought he was dead when they left him lying there . I surely did n't expect to find him still breathing when I saw what they 'd done . " <p> " But who ? Who would want to hurt Douglass ? " <p> " I do n't know if they came intending to hurt him . Maybe they just wanted his ... our ... things . " <p> Emma said the word " things " as if she wanted to run through her luxurious new beach house and throw all its beautiful furnishings-antiques , artwork , and all-into the waves . <p> " I knew right away that something was wrong , " Emma raved on , " just as soon as I got home . Somebody had kicked the glass right out of the front door and left it wide open . When I saw that , I started looking for Douglass . The light over the basement stairs was the only one burning in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything was dumped on the floor , all your artifacts and your file folders and everything , and Douglass was lying bloody in the middle of the mess . Oh , Faye ... " <p> " I 'm coming , " Faye said , though she did n't move to start the skiff 's motor , not yet . She needed to be able to hear everything her tortured friend had to say . " I 'm just so glad that whoever did this was gone when you got there . " <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
