A Fleet of One // The little four-wheelers live on risk . They endanger themselves . They endangered us . If you 're in a big truck , they 're around you like gnats . They 're at their worst in the on-ramps of limited-access highways , not to mention what they do on horse-and-buggy highways . They do the kissing tailgate . They do passing moves over double yellow lines . They make last-second break-ins from stop signs on feeder roads . The way they are operated suggests insufficiency in , among other things , co ? rdination , depth perception , and rhythm . When I went to bad-driver school , the opening lecturer did not imply any such flaws in his students . He was a real bear . He wore blue-and-yellow trousers and a badge . In a voice he fired like a .45 , he began by asking us , " How many of you people think you 're good drivers ? " // We had all been singled out in four-wheelers . My own car had a tendency to ignore stop signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other ways as well . After I reached twelve points , I was offered admission to the New Jersey Driver Improvement Program , on the following voluntary basis : enroll or lose your license . Among the twenty-five people in the class , two smart-asses stuck up their hands in positive response to the instructor 's question . He looked them over , then swept the room . " Well , you must all be good drivers , " he said . " If you were n't , you 'd be dead . " // Then he darkened the room and rolled a film showing cars hitting cars in on- ramps . A , looking left , accelerates . B , looking left , accelerates . B rear-ends A , because A hesitated , and B was still looking to the left . This primal accident , the figure eight of bad driving , was the base of a graphic montage that ended in high-speed collision and hideous death on the road . // These memories of bad-driver school ran through me in eastern Oregon after Don Ainsworth , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air horn to a step van that was coming fast up an on-ramp on a vector primed for a crash . A step van is a walk-in vehicle of the UPS variety , and , like all other four-wheelers , from Jettas to Jaguars , in Ainsworth 's perspective is not a truck . FedEx , Wonder Bread , Soprano Sand-and-Gravel-they 're not trucks , they 're four-wheelers , even if they have six wheels . A true truck has eighteen wheels , or more . From Atlanta and Charlotte to North Powder , Oregon , this was the first time that Ainsworth had so much as tapped his air horn . In the three thousand one hundred and ninety miles I rode with him he used it four times . He gave it a light , muted blast to thank a woman in a four-wheeler who helped us make a turn in urban traffic close to our destination , and he used it twice in the Yakima Valley , flirting with a woman who was wearing a bikini . She passed us on I-82 , and must have pulled over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She waved both times the horn erupted . She was riding in a convertible and her top was down . // If the step van had hit us it would only have been inconvenient , the fact notwithstanding that we were hauling hazmats . The step van weighed about ten thousand pounds and we weighed eighty thousand pounds , minus a few ounces . Ainsworth said he could teach a course called On-Ramp 101 . " We get many near-misses from folks who ca n't time their entry . They give you the finger . Women even give you the finger . Can you believe it ? " // I could believe it . // " Four-wheelers will pass us and then pull in real fast and put on their brakes for no apparent reason , " he said . " Four-wheelers are not aware of the danger of big trucks . They 're not aware of the weight , of how long it takes to bring one to a halt , how quickly their life can be snuffed . If you pull any stunts around the big trucks , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die . You are . " // We happened to be approaching Deadman Pass . We were crossing the Blue Mountains-on I-84 , the Oregon Trail . He said , " Before you know it , we 'll be sitting on top of Cabbage . Then we 're going to fall down . " He had mentioned Cabbage Hill when we were still in the Great Divide Basin . He mentioned it again in Pocatello . After crossing into Oregon and drawing closer , he brought it up twice an hour . " It 's the terrific hill we fall down before we come to Pendleton . Pretty treacherous . Switchbacks . Speed restricted by weight . You 'll see guys all the time with smoke flying out the brakes or even a flameout at the bottom . " // From the Carolina piedmont to Hot Lake , Oregon-across the Appalachians , across the Rockies-he had not put his foot on the brake pedal on any descending grade . In harmony with shrewd gear selection , this feat was made possible by Jake Brakes-a product of Jacobs Vehicle Systems , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retarder , generically-you 're turning a diesel engine into an air compressor . " On a grade we descended in Tennessee , he said , " If you choose your gear right , and your jake 's on maxi , you can go down a hill with no brakes . It saves money . It also lengthens my life . " Crossing the summit of the Laramie Range and addressing the western side , he geared down from twelfth to eighth and said , " I wo n't use one ounce of brake pressure . The jake is on maxi . " As big trucks flew past us-dry boxes , reefers-he said , " These guys using brakes with improper gear selection do n't own the tractor or the trailer . Using brakes costs money , but why would they care ? " Ainsworth owns the tractor and the trailer . As he glided onto the Laramie Plains , he went back up to eighteenth gear : " the going home gear , the smoke hole ; when you got into this gear in the old days , your stacks would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , he tried fifteenth gear , and his foot had to graze the pedal . He seemed annoyed with himself , like a professional golfer who had chosen the wrong club . // And now we were about to " fall down Cabbage . " In ten miles , we would drop two thousand feet , six of those miles on a six-per-cent grade . Through basaltic throughcuts we approached the brink . A sign listed speed limits by weight . If you weighed sixty thousand to sixty-five thousand pounds , your limit was thirty-seven miles an hour . In five-thousand-pound increments , speed limits went down to twenty-six and twenty-two . Any vehicle weighing seventy-five thousand pounds or more-e.g. , this chemical tanker-was to go eighteen or under . A huge high view with Pendleton in it suddenly opened up . I had asked Ainsworth what makes a tractor-trailer jackknife . He had said , " You 're going downhill . The trailer is going faster than the tractor . The trailer takes over . It 's almost impossible to bring yourself out of it . Brakes wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of going too fast for the situation . It can happen on a flat highway , but nine times out of ten it 's downhill . " The escarpment was so steep that the median widened from a few feet to one and a half miles as the northbound and southbound lanes negotiated independent passage . Ainsworth had chosen eighth gear . He said , " Most truckers would consider this way too conservative . That does n't mean they 're bright . " Oregon is the only American state in which trucks are speed-restricted by weight . Feet off both pedals , he started the fall down Cabbage praising the truck for " good jake " and himself for " nice gear selection . " My ears thickened and popped . // " Six per cent is serious , " he said . " I 've seen some sevens or eights . British Columbia drivers talk about tens and twelves. " // In two strategic places among the broad looping switchbacks were escape ramps , also known as arrester beds , where a brakeless runaway truck-its driver " mashing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave the road and plow up a very steep incline on soft sandy gravel . In winter , the gravel may not be soft . Ainsworth recalled a trucker in Idaho who hit a frozen ramp . His load , bursting through from behind , removed his head . On Cabbage Hill , deep fresh tracks went up an arrester bed several hundred feet . After trucks use a bed , it has to be regroomed . The state charges grooming fees . Some drivers , brakeless and out of control , stay on the highway and keep on plunging because they do n't want to pay the grooming fees . Ainsworth said , " Would you worry about your life or the God-damned grooming fee ? " // He was asking the wrong person . // A little later , he said , " Bears will roost at the bottom here . " // Fulfilling the prediction , two cars were in ambush in the median where the grade met the plain . Wheat fields filled the plain-endless leagues of wheat , big combines moving through the wheat , houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We passed a couple of dry boxes , both of them Freightliners . Among truckers , they are also known as Freightshakers . " What 's the difference between a Jehovah 's Witness and the door on a Freightliner ? " Ainsworth said . // I said I did n't happen to know . // He said , " You can close a door on a Jehovah 's Witness . " // We crossed the Columbia River and went over the Horse Heaven Hills into the Yakima Valley , apples and grapes in the Horse Heaven Hills , gators in the valley . To avoid a gator he swung far right , over rumble bars along the shoulder . A gator is a strip of tire , dead on the road , nearly always a piece of a recap . " A gator can rip off your fuel-crossover line , punch in your bumper , bomb out a fender . " // The Yakima River was deeply incised and ran in white water past vineyards and fruit trees , among windbreaks of Lombardy poplars . Hops were growing on tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty in the wide valley it could have been in Italy . Now , through high haze , we first saw the Cascades . On our route so far , no mountain range had been nearly as impressive . We had slithered over the Rockies for the most part through broad spaces . Now we were looking at a big distant barrier , white over charcoal green , its highest visible point the stratovolcano Mt . Adams . We met three new Kenworths coming east-three connected tractors without trailers . One was hauling the other two , both of which had their front wheels up on the back of the tractor ahead of them . They looked like three dogs humping . It was here that we were first passed by the scant bikini in an open Porsche , here that Ainsworth touched his horn for the second time on the journey . I was marginally jealous that he could look down into that bikini while I , on the passenger side , was served rumble bars in the pavement . I had long since asked him what sorts of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People reading books , " he answered . " Women putting on makeup . People committing illicit acts . Exhibitionist women like to show you their treasures . A boyfriend is driving . She drops her top . " // We skirted Yakima city . " ' Yakima , the Palm Springs of Washington , ' " Ainsworth said . " That was written by a guy on laughing gas . " He reached for his CB microphone . " Eastbounders , there 's a pair of bears waiting for you . They 're down there right before the flats . " Now ahead of us was a long pull up North Umptanum Ridge . " We 're going to give ' em hell , " he said . In the left lane , he took the big tanker up to eighty-three , pressing for advantage on the climb . He was in the fast lane to overtake a flatbed hauling fifty thousand pounds of logs . The distance had almost closed ; we were practically counting tree rings when the logging truck began to sway . It weaved right and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Oh , my goodness ! " // Ordinarily , I tend to be nervous if I am riding in a car driven by someone else . Like as not , the someone else is Yolanda Whitman , to whom I am married . On trips , we divide the driving time . I make her nervous and she makes me nervous . She was a student in bad-driver school in the same year that I was . While she is at the wheel , I sometimes write letters . I ask the recipients to " excuse my shaky penmanship , " and explain that I am " riding in a badly driven car . " Coast to coast with Don Ainsworth was as calm an experience as sitting in an armchair watching satellite pictures of the earth . In only three moments did anxiety in any form make a bid for the surface . None had to do with his driving . The first was over the Mississippi River on the bridge to St. Louis-the big arch in the foreground , the water far below-where we seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside us , just a void of air and a deep fall to the river . The second was in St. Joseph , where we swung through town on I-229 for a look at the Missouri River , and the narrow roadway , on high stilts , was giddy , a flying causeway convex to the waterfront . Falling down Cabbage Hill , concern for safety had n't crossed my mind . And now this big logger was bringing up a third and final shot of adrenaline . We got by tightly . The driver was smoking something . // The ridges were dry in that part of Washington-rainfall less than eight inches a year . At elevations under three thousand feet , the ridges were not notably high-certainly not with the Pacific Crest becoming ever more imminent at twelve , thirteen , fourteen thousand feet . We made another long pull , over Manastash Ridge , and drifted down from the brown country into another paradise of irrigation-instant Umbria , just add water . It was a dazzling scene , the green valley of hay , wheat , and poplars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goosed by the air horn and waving . By Cle Elum , we were pulling at the mountains themselves-less than a hundred miles from Seattle and approaching Snoqualmie Pass . Listening to his engine climb , Ainsworth called it " operatic .
