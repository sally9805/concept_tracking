STANDING on the doorstep of the innocuous suburban house that Friday afternoon , I nervously straightened my tie , smoothed down my cowlick , and swallowed a mouthful of saliva . I had n't been this nervous since asking Jeannie Medieros to the junior prom twenty years ago . But then again , it was not every day that I - that anyone , for that matter - got to meet Vigny Maguire , one of the most mysterious presences on the Internet , and simply the finest amateur critic ever to submit a reader response to Amazon or Barnes &; Noble . Maguire 's work had first appeared just a year and a half ago . The earliest Maguire post that anyone had been able to track down was attached to the listing for Who Would Jesus Do ? A Christian Guide to Premarital Sex . In just under a hundred-and-fifty words , Maguire had brilliantly torn to pieces this opportunistic , trashy self-help book by the rock group Creed , displaying the savage wit and flair for the well-turned phrase that would come to characterize all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I now feared would be turned against me for daring to violate his privacy . ) Swiftly following this post had come dozens of others on all the big bookseller sites , commenting on a carefully chosen selection of novels , story collections , popular science books , military histories , memoirs , cookbooks - just about any type of book that the marketplace offered . Maguire 's dissections of these titles were always amusing , accurate , insightful , and heartfelt . In short , he manifested all the qualities of a consummate professional reviewer , except that he was doing all the work for free , and remained resolutely shrouded from the public eye . Within the past six months , a fanatical fandom had coalesced around the faceless Maguire and his reviews . ( I myself admired his work immensely . ) He had become the Thomas Pynchon of amateur online reviewers . A positive notice from him would send sales of even the most humble book soaring , while a negative blast would put a hole in the hull of even the most titanic bestseller . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in vain to court a positive Maguire review , and lived in fear of a negative one . Hundreds of websites devoted just to adoration of Maguire had been set up , and an equal number of attempts to ferret out his identity had been launched . However , no one had successfully tracked him down through the thicket of shell accounts he worked through . That is , until now . The literary cyberzine I worked for - Saloon - employed one of the world 's finest hackers , a guy named Mack Bunratty , to defend the site from attacks . On a lark , my boss had asked Bunratty to try to get some hard data on Maguire . In short order , Bunratty had come up with what looked to be Maguire 's true ISP provider and an address lifted from their accounts . Now here I stood . My assignment as junior editor : to get Vigny Maguire to come to work exclusively for Saloon . No point in waiting any longer . I pushed the doorbell button and held my breath . What would Maguire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my ringing to elicit a response . Would he unleash on me one of his patented caustic jibes ? Perhaps something akin to the line he had dropped on Norman Mailer 's newest collection of essays , Rumblings From My Gut : " If this guy were n't already dead , it would be necessary to uninvent him . " What rewards could I possibly offer this rebellious lone wolf , this independent-minded citizen of world literature , that might convince him to write solely for us ? The door swung open . A frazzled looking housefrau , clutching a toilet scrub brush in one hand and the fist of a wailing toddler in the other , confronted me with a look of pure exasperation . " Mrs. Maguire ? " I chanced . " Mrs. Vigny Maguire ? " " No , I 'm sorry , there 's no one here by that name . Now , if you 'll excuse me - " Bunratty had sworn a hundred arcane hacker oaths that this address was the origin of the Vigny Maguire postings . Plainly Maguire 's wife had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I could n't give up so easily . " Mrs. Maguire , please listen a minute . I know your husband values his privacy . He 's not a showboater , not a greedy man . His only god is good writing . But I think that my arrival here unaccompanied by a horde of media people should serve as testament to my honest intentions . If I could just speak to your husband for a moment - " The woman 's exasperation increased , especially when she noticed that the momentarily unmonitored toddler had begun chewing on the toilet brush . " You listen to me . My husband is named Hank Spindler . He 's a salesman for Amalgamated tile . If you 're one of those sneaks from Consolidated Terraces trying to get a preview of the new Delft-tone line , you 're plumb out of luck . " The woman 's sincerity was undeniable . I was baffled . How could this be - ? " Mom , this guy 's here to see me . Let him in . " From behind Mrs. Spindler emerged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks , skinny undeveloped frame . She wore a Hello Kitty T-shirt , cargo shorts , and jelly sandals . " Vigny ? Vigny Maguire ? " The girl laughed . " You got me . Although most people around here call me Leia . " Mrs. Spindler seemed even more confused than I was . " Leia , what 's this all about ? " She narrowed her eyes . " Have you gotten in trouble with that computer of yours ? " " No , no , not at all , " I hastened to reassure Vigny Maguire 's Mom . " Far from it . Your daughter is something of an Internet celebrity . I 'm just the first person to track her down . " " I do n't know what to think - " " Oh , Mom , chill out , okay ? What 's your name , mister ? " " Stan . StanCapaldi . " " C'monin , Stan . " Before I had really gotten over my shock , Vigny and I - Leia , really , I supposed I should call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unexceptional rec room . Overflowing bookshelves were the room 's main decorative motif - aside from a television large enough to illuminate a football stadium , with Xbox and well-thumbed controllers attached . Infant toys were scattered across the deep-pile rug and a set of Franklin Mint commemorative teddybear figurines sat proudly in their own display case . As I tried to compose my thoughts , Mrs. Spindler brought us Pepperidge Farm cookies and some kind of synthetic lemonade . Leia seemed content just to nibble on a cookie and smile at me in a disconcertingly sardonic fashion , so at last I framed a question , just to break the silence . " So , how come Vigny Maguire ? " " Avril Lavigne and Lizzie Maguire . " " Oh , sure .... " " I suppose you want to know if I really wrote all those reviews , or if some adult did . " " That question did occur to me . " " Well , put your mind at rest . I did " em all . I 've been reading at college level since I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra-credit reading assignments I 've handed in . My school had to put a limit of A-plus-plus-plus on their grading system because of me . But it was only a couple of years ago that it hit me . " " What ? What hit you ? " " That I could talk back to the people who made books . Y'know , make the publishers listen to me . Help other readers steer clear of bad books and jump on the good ones . It was all thanks to the Internet , of course . Back in the day , I would 've never had such a chance . I never could 've done anything like this without the web . " " Uh , Leia , do you actually realize the , um , stature that Vigny Maguire has acquired in the literary marketplace ? " " Duh ! I hang out on the Vigny Maguire sites , do n't I , Stan ? Sure I realize it . That 's most of the fun ! " " Leia , certain authors are slitting their wrists because of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Leia shrugged . " Nobody forced the losers to become writers . And the winners deserve it . It 's all part of the game . Besides , other critics and reviewers have powers like mine . Maybe they 're not quite so influential , but the basic deal is the same . My so-called power only comes from the fact that millions of people happen to agree with me . You 're just objecting to my role because I did n't turn out to be some hairy-chested college professor like you expected me to be . " I started to protest , then was forced to admit to myself that Leia was absolutely right . If I had encountered the Vigny Maguire of my fantasies , this discussion would 've never happened . " You 're absolutely right , Leia . I was being prejudiced by your age . You 've earned your accomplishments , and no one should try to take them away from you . " Leia visibly relaxed , and I became aware that much of her bravado had been a defiant , nervous facade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ? " " Far from it . In fact , the magazine I represent wants you to come to work exclusively for us . " I laid out the terms we were prepared to offer , then waited nervously for Leia 's response . " Hmmm .... Free books , a paycheck , no censorship like the commercial sites lay on me - sounds totally sweet . " <p> " Leia , that 's wonderful ! So can I assume we have a deal ? " " Sure , fust one last thing . " " What ? " " I want to meet Avril Lavigne and Hilary Duff . " " Saloon has a little cachet . I think that can be arranged . " Now Leia was bouncing up and down like any excited teen . " And , and , oh yeah - Michael Dirda too ! "
