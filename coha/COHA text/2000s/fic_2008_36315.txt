Hslot out Z-Motion Sixty-two Semi Y-Hook Z-Flag on two , on two ! " <p> Jogging up to the line of scrimmage , I repeated the jumble of code words instructing me to run ten yards upfield , stop , turn around , and wait for a pass . It used to be the kid with the best arm in the neighborhood would simply tell me , " Run a curl . Joey , run a post . Teddy , go to the corner . Billy , go deep . And the rest of you guys stay in and block . " That was when football was a game . After eight years in the National Football League I knew what I was doing at the moment was anything but a game . <p> " Blue Fifty-two ! Blue Fifty-two ! " shouted Dan Ramsey . <p> Ramsey was our backup quarterback . He 'd taken over when golden-boy Ron Hanes broke his leg . Ron was the team 's franchise player , the highest-paid guy on the New York Giants . We 'd made each other famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the league . He threw the balls and I caught them . But he 'd gotten hurt back in September and was out for the season . Ramsey filled in admirably . Hell , we 'd all been performing admirably without Ron . Somehow , his absence made us all play better . With five games left on the schedule , we were 10  --  1 . With any luck , we 'd improve to 11  --  1 after beating the Philadelphia Eagles , whose defense was now staring me in the face as I assumed my three-point stance as the Giants ' tight end . <p> " Set ! " <p> The Eagles sucked . They 'd only won three games all year . That did n't mean much . Regardless of records , our meetings were always a toss-up ; more like rumbles than games . So it was no surprise we found ourselves trailing 21  --  14 in the fourth quarter . <p> " Hut ! " <p> Crouched in my stance , the fingers of my right hand pressed into the artificial turf of Philly 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knee . My blue-and-white sock drooped below my calf , and I ran my fingers over the long scar across my kneecap from last year 's surgery . It was raised and bumpy and ran like a diagonal zipper from one corner of my knee to the other . Although twelve months had passed since my ligaments had been torn to shreds , the injury was still fresh in my mind . The pain accounted for that . But the injury did n't worry me . It was just the latest in a long string of mishaps . I 'd already overcome a dozen surgeries to various parts of my body with no problems . It was going to take a lot more than a bum knee to slow me down . Although a lot of people had thought my career was over , I proved them wrong . My knee recovered just enough , and I was now playing as well as ever . Hell , the way I felt at the moment , the end of my career was nowhere in sight . <p> " Hut ! " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the linebacker before me , swung his elbow at my head , then wrapped his other hand around the back of my shoulder . My breath shot out unexpectedly as his taped hand slapped my spine and stuck to me like glue . I tried to avoid him . My job was to run a pass pattern , not to get tangled up with him . But the price of being a good tight end in the National Football League was no free releases off the line of scrimmage . The harassment was a sign of respect . I took it as a compliment . <p> " Get your fuckin ' hands off me ! " I yelled , regaining my breath . <p> " Fuck you , punk ! " he replied . <p> " Fuck you , bitch ! " <p> And so our conversation continued from our previous fifty plays . Churning my legs into the turf , I chopped at the linebacker 's arms with my fists and elbows . Despite the pain , my knee felt good . The Butazolodine I 'd taken at halftime was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked wonders for me . I could n't play without it . <p> Fighting my way off the line of scrimmage , I thought to myself , I love this game . Not because it was fun . But because it made me whole . I 'd been playing football since the fourth grade . It was who I was . It was all I was . I was respected because of it . I was known because of it . And most important , I was paid because of it . It was my job and I was good at it . <p> Cracking the linebacker 's forearm with an elbow and shoving my palm into his chin , I wondered if I would ever achieve the same satisfaction from another profession . I guess I 'd never know , because I planned on playing forever . <p> " Banjo ! Banjo ! " the 240-pound prick holding my jersey screamed as I broke free of his grasp . He was communicating with his middle linebacker . Banjo was a defensive code word meaning I was about to be handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man to another . As Groggins 's fingers flicked from my jersey and he fell to the ground , I ricocheted into freedom . Unmolested , I stole a quick glance at my surroundings . Bodies were everywhere , each consumed with his personal opponent . Chaos seemed to reign . But in fact , it was all carefully planned and rehearsed . As expected , the Philadelphia middle linebacker appeared directly in front of me ready to assume the package his buddy was delivering . <p> The middle backer was about two inches shorter than the six-foot-four-inch outside backer but at least twenty pounds heavier . He moved awkwardly compared to the grace of his teammate , but because his job was to fill holes and stand his ground at all costs , he was an even more formidable foe here in the middle of the field where there was little room to maneuver . <p> Ramsey expected me to be ten yards over the center in about one and a half seconds . My pass route demanded discipline and timing . Like a baseball player running the bases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any room . But even if there were , I could n't ad-lib . The only path to my assigned spot went straight through this new prick . <p> As Groggins 's hand left my jersey , the middle backer stuck his head into my chest . Until I was farther downfield , I was fair game to these headhunters . My ribs bent inward at the blow , and my shoulders nearly met on the other side of his head . He hit me so hard his face mask touched my spinal cord . My breath exploded like a popped balloon , and I spit my mouth guard out with the force of a bottle rocket . He 'd gotten me good , but I 'd seen it coming . This , at least , gave me time to plan my countermove . <p> Even as his head displaced my lungs , I grabbed the back of his shoulder pads with one arm and , like a swimmer , swung my other arm over his head . With a tug of his shirt and a twist of my body , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to the ground . <p> Adhering to the imaginary baseline of my pass pattern , and trying to regain my breath , I continued to my designated spot ten yards deep into the defense . It only took three unimpeded strides to get there , and when I did , I planted my feet firmly in the turf and turned around . <p> The ball met me in the exact spot that the middle backer 's helmet had just vacated . It had been no more than a brown flash in the bottom of my eyes , but my hands rose instinctually to meet it . The sound and feel of the ball as it thwacked into my hands told me it was a completion before my eyes confirmed it . Holding it now like a potted plant I 'd just purchased from a nursery , I was met from behind by a blow to my back . The force buckled my knees and nearly popped the ball loose from my grasp . It took every fingernail I had to hold on to it . The hit had been hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It must have been delivered by a defensive back . Whoever it was , I felt him slide down my legs . Before he could grab my ankles and trip me up , I tucked the pigskin into my belly and turned upfield . For the first time since I 'd left the line of scrimmage , I could see farther than a few yards in front of me . I began running for my life . <p> Philly had been triple-teaming me , I realized . Groggins , the middle backer , and now the defensive back had all been assigned to prevent Ramsey from throwing to me . With the other Eagle defenders chasing Giant receivers all over the field , they were n't even aware that I 'd caught the ball . <p> The end zone was forty yards away and only one Eagle stood in my way : Demetri Rivers . From the look of things , he was the only man with a chance of making the tackle . A smile came to my lips . Of all the Eagles I could 've faced , Rivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up forty pounds to me , but because I hated him . He was a cheap-shot artist , known around the league as " Dirty " Rivers . Like a hunter who gathers pelts for his wall , Rivers collected the cartilage and careers of opposing players . As a football player , he was average . But as a hitter , he was dangerous , especially after the whistle when you were n't looking . <p> Over the years , I 'd absorbed a multitude of his blows , most of them aimed at my back , kidneys , knees , and lower spine . Never had he hit me head-on , and never had he struck the initial blow . He was a scavenger on the football food chain , joining feeding frenzies only after the prey had been disabled . His shots were usually the third or fourth delivered and were executed not with the intent to tackle , but solely to inflict as much damage as possible . <p> The sight of him standing there on the twenty-yard line made me drool . For the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tackle had fallen squarely on his shoulders . He could n't jump on the pile this time . Instead , he would have to create it . <p> Like a shark smelling blood , I strained to get to him faster . He did nothing to hasten our collision , but simply stood there waiting for reinforcements . I hurried to get to him before any arrived . I could see his mind calculating our size difference : 210 pounds of still weight versus 250 pounds of rolling fury . Those figures could n't have boosted his confidence . <p> We needed a touchdown to tie the game . I knew one little juke to Rivers in the open field would accomplish this . But I also knew the opportunity to run him over might never come again . <p> " Look at him ! " a little voice in my head suddenly yelled into my ear . " Bury him ! Make him hurt ! Make him pay ! " <p> The voice was persuasive . But I 'd never needed much prompting to hit someone . Leaning forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms shooting back and forth like pistons . I felt I could punch them through steel , and indeed , I intended to punch them through Rivers . The football became a distraction , and in my rage I thought of dropping it . I did n't , though . I wanted to put Rivers out of the game , but I had n't completely lost my mind . <p> As I came within range of my target , Rivers stood still . The whites of his eyes expanded like two carnations blooming in time-lapse photography . The moment of impact was upon us . I lowered my head , leaned forward , and abandoned all chance of advancing to the end zone . I was sacrificing a touchdown to satisfy my bloodlust . I would deal with our head coach 's disapproval later . Besides , in his heart , Lou Gordon would understand . He 'd drafted me because of my temperament . Eight years on the front line had only intensified it . I was going for the kill . <p> The last thing I saw as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirtiest player in the league . At the last instant before contact , Rivers moved his body out of the line of my main thrust . He 'd been baiting me all along the way a toreador does a bull . Using his head as a red cape , he ducked away at the last second and with his helmet went for his own kill shot , his intended target all along  --  my knee . <p> The two hit brutally hard . The foam rubber of my knee-pad did little to absorb the blow . It might as well have been made of tissue paper . I felt as if I 'd run full speed into a knee-high fence . The impact was swift and intense . My leg cut out from under me , and my forward momentum turned into a nosedive . With no time to twist or turn or even extend an arm , my face mask drove straight into the turf , past the threadbare carpet of Veterans Stadium , and into the cement foundation on which it lay . My brain sloshed inside my skull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay there , I was sure of only two things . One , I had come half a footstep away from blowing out my once-already-blown-out knee . And two , I had squandered the chance to score a touch-down that we desperately needed . <p> Watching the clouds float overhead , I smelled something vile beside me . Dirty Rivers was on his knees , holding his head in pain . I glowed with satisfaction until I realized his situation was n't serious . A headache was a small price to pay for nearly ending my career . That I 'd attempted to end his was inconsequential . <p> He looked back at me with disappointment in his eyes . " You 're a lucky prick , Fucillo , " he said . " But do n't worry . I know which knee it is , and I 'll get it before the day 's over . " There was malice in his voice and determination on his face . <p> My rage intensified . That little bastard . Hiding behind that helmet , cloaking his criminal behavior in the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my head returned . " Rip his head off ! " it whispered . <p> I struggled to my feet to go after him , but a referee came up behind me . <p> " Do n't even think about it , number eighty-four ! Give me the ball and get back to your huddle . " <p> " So you heard what he said ? " I asked . <p> " Give me the ball and get back to your huddle . " <p> Rivers began laughing . <p> " C'm on , ref , that 's bullshit . The guy 's trying to take out my knee . Get him off the field . " <p> " Just give me the ball and get back to your huddle . " <p> " At least throw a flag . " <p> " Ball , please . " <p> " You worthless piece a'sh  --  " <p> " Watch it , Fucillo . The only one who 'll be getting a flag is you . You ai n't no choirboy yourself . So quit whining and just play the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands and ran to spot it at the nearest hash mark . I watched in disbelief and fury . As the referee , he 's supposed to regulate on-field behavior , but instead does nothing but blows whistles and spots balls . What good was he ? Why was he even out there ? <p> " You 're pathetic , " I said to him . " If you 're not gon na do anything about that dirtbag , then I 'm gon na ! " <p> He tapped the yellow flag in his back pocket with his fingers as a warning . <p> " You throw that flag and I 'll kick your ass , " I said . <p> I 'm not sure if he heard me , but Rivers did . <p> " C'm on , Fucillo . You know you ai n't gon na hit no ref . Now go to your huddle , boy , and get the play . My helmet 's got an appointment with your knee . " <p> I made a move for him . He was only ten yards away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopping me in midstride . " The play 's over . Let it go and get in the huddle . " <p> Oh , right , the game . I reeled in my anger for the moment and returned to the huddle . Ramsey called the next play . <p> " Two Flood F-Peel Eighty Max X-Post Z-In on one , on one ! " <p> " Break ! " <p> The only word I needed to know was max , which stood for " maximum pass protection . " That meant I stayed on the line of scrimmage to block rather than run another pass route . Thank God . That last play took a lot out of me . I looked forward to the chance to catch my breath . <p> " Green eighty ! Green eighty ! Set , hut ! " <p> Springing upright , I waited for Groggins to rush the passer , but he just stood there , waiting for me to run a pattern . It was a standoff . Neither one of us felt moved to improvise . We simply stared at each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice moment until I saw Ramsey 's pass fly into the hands of the Eagles ' middle linebacker , who intercepted the ball in the flat . With no one in his path , he began running toward our goal line . Suddenly , my vacation was over . <p> As the fastest Giant among the pursuers , I had the only shot at making the tackle . I dodged two defensive linemen , then came up on a wall of linebackers escorting their buddy to the end zone . Wedging myself into the pack , I tried to make a grab at the man with the ball . I got a hand on him but Groggins rebuffed my effort . The middle linebacker raced unmolested down the sideline . It was all over but the end-zone dance . Meanwhile , Groggins wanted to disengage from me and go celebrate with his buddies . No way , I thought . I held him tight . The impending touchdown was going to bury us , and I 'd be damned if the guy I 'd been battling all day was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downfield , pushing , shoving , and grabbing each other 's jerseys until I ran him out of bounds and bodyslammed him to the turf . He hit the ground hard and I landed on top of him with an elbow to his neck for good measure . Instinct and experience told me he was n't going to appreciate that . So I rolled onto my feet with raised fists and prepared for action . But Groggins got up and resumed his trip to the end zone without giving me a second thought . <p> There I was , ready for a fight with no one to hit , when suddenly a green flash of an opposing jersey traveling at high speed appeared out of the corner of my eye . It was heading right at me . Dirty Rivers . He may have been coming over to gloat or to taunt . He may have been trying to take another shot at my knee . His intentions mattered little at this point . I did n't hesitate . In an instant , my fists were cocked and loaded , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a solid right hand into the heart of his Adam 's apple . He dropped like a rock , gagging . For a second , I wondered if I 'd broken his windpipe . I did n't feel bad about it . I just wondered . <p> I did n't have much time to reflect , for as I stood over that choking asshole , a metallic ping against the side of my helmet distracted me from my thoughts . A bright yellow flag , tied at one end around a neat little ball of BBs , bounced off my head and sailed through the air on its way to the ground . <p> " Personal foul ! Number eighty-four ! " I heard someone scream . <p> I looked toward the voice . The same official who only a moment before had told me to " quit whining " was pointing his finger at me in condemnation . The nerve of that bastard ! He knew what Rivers was all about . Could n't he see I was defending myself ? My rage overflowed . The Philadelphia crowd was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eagle victory . The noise was deafening . The ref was barely audible . Blood rushed to my head , the stands started to spin , Rivers 's choking grew distant , and all I could see was the ref 's finger wavering in slow motion , inches from my face , provoking me , as his deliberate and guttural voice mouthed the words again in an obvious gesture of overkill : " Perrrsonalll Foulll ! Numberrr eightyyy-fourrr ! " <p> What happened next was n't my fault . I told the son of a bitch what I 'd do if he threw that flag . <p> Excerpted from Rough &amp; Tumble by Mark Bavaro <p> Copyright 2008 by Mark Bavaro <p> Published in 2008 by St. Martin
