<p> Class in session on teacher retirement / Funds woefully lacking , unfair <p> These days in my home the subject of an adequate retirement is a hot topic of discussion . As a lifetime and truly committed educator , I am now deciding whether I have enough retirement forthcoming to plan for a healthy and happy retirement in the next few years . <p> My husband and I have spent hours weaving , spinning and reworking the numbers , weighing options and costs of health insurance , mixed with calculations of years of service , the possibility of " double dipping " seasoned with guesses on our anticipated life spans . The projected outcomes are woefully lacking and glaringly unfair . <p> Day in and day out , I have chosen to place my focus and energies into the students and school districts I served . I consider myself fortunate to have been employed as a teacher and , now , as an administrator . While I remain employed , I know I will continue to be treated in a professional manner . <p> But when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a younger generation of educators , that will be the time for the state to do its part by rewarding those who stood at the door of the schoolhouses statewide welcoming each and every child each day . <p> I heartily support U.S. Rep. John Culberson , R-Houston , and the Social Security Fairness Act that would allow teachers and other government workers to receive full Social Security benefits from their own contributions or those of their spouses . <p> Judith Lasseter , Clear Lake <p> Class in session on teacher retirement / Why allow teachers loophole ? <p> Responding to Sondra Pickering 's July 8 Outlook article , " A local teacher 's lesson on Social Security issue " : Pickering justifies the teacher loophole as a means for a retiring teacher to draw the Social Security benefits he or she is " entitled to receive . " I think it 's important and only fair to juxtapose a teacher 's perspective with my own . <p> By working as little as a single day and making such a small contribution to Social Security , teachers entitle themselves to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own teacher retirement . <p> Yet millions of families with two breadwinners who are not teachers do not enjoy that benefit and suffer penalties from the Social Security system each day . These wage earners contribute thousands into Social Security and then watch as their spouses ' Social Security benefits are reduced dollar for dollar . All those years of paychecks with Social Security deductions paid in just evaporate as another marriage penalty . <p> The argument about teacher retirement is not about being entitled to one 's spousal benefits , because teachers are already entitled to those . But unlike the rest of us , teachers ' spousal benefits are reduced by just two to three , not dollar for dollar . This is a debate about fairness . <p> Should Texas teachers be the only class of Americans who get 100 percent of their teacher retirement , plus 100 percent of their spouse 's Social Security , when no one else does ? <p> I applaud U.S. Rep. Kevin Brady , R-The Woodlands , for telling teachers that he was not willing to create two classes of citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one without . <p> Rita Huggler , Spring <p> Class in session on teacher retirement / Need adequate compensation <p> I have been a teacher and a counselor for more than 40 years , during which time I worked in other states that had both teacher retirement and Social Security . All of my annual " quarters " have been paid to Social Security . <p> Yet , because I am a retired teacher in the state of Texas , I am not allowed to collect my husband 's Social Security . <p> Something is wrong with this . <p> My brother in-law is retired military , and he collects both his military pension and Social Security . If his wife survives him , she will collect both when he dies . As I come from a military family and know how grossly underpaid our armed forces are , I am glad he will receive both . <p> But teachers are also underpaid and are entrusted with our greatest resource - our children . It 's time we gave them the respect due a dedicated professional . We must adequately compensate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Houston <p> Class in session on teacher retirement / But other states allow this . . . <p> In her July 7 Viewpoints letter , " Do n't allow double-dips , " Sari Harris had her information wrong about teachers ' retirement . I am a retired Texas teacher who is losing my spousal benefits . <p> Texas is one of only 14 states to have this pension offset law . All other states allow retiring teachers to collect their spousal benefits as well as their state retirement . <p> Do n't condemn the teachers of Texas . They work for a lot less money than teachers in other states . <p> Connie Jagielski , The Woodlands <p> Class in session on teacher retirement / They get bonuses all along <p> In his July 7 Viewpoints letter , " Why be a teacher , then ? " David Henderson conveniently left out one point in discussing teachers ' spousal Social Security benefits : the bonus of working for 20 or 30 years and not having to pay Social Security ! This group received its Social Security money up front , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropping out of Social Security without losing Medicare and Medicaid , I would do it and never look back . I would n't be worried about spousal benefits , and I would even be happy for the government to keep everything I had already contributed . <p> A.W . Jones , Houston <p> Redistricting quagmire / Let Legislature do its duty <p> Existing congressional representation is based on 12-year-old Democratic gerrymandering , combined with a Democratic refusal to do the job of redistricting two years ago when state power was more divided . The Chronicle 's partisan editorial ( July 9 , " Drop It / Redistricting would benefit few Texans , harm many " ) was outrageous in its support of the continuation of the 1990 gerrrymander , rather than urging the Legislature to do its duty . <p> James E. Gillett , Missouri City <p> Redistricting quagmire / Do n't rewrite 2002 results <p> Did I just imagine the 2002 congressional elections ? I know the Legislature failed to redistrict in 2001 and the task was instead done by a panel of judges , but redistricting did occur and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run candidates in each of the congressional districts , and Republican voters had their votes . <p> Now , after the dust has settled and the Democrats won a majority of the seats , the Republicans want to overturn the will of the voters and hold elections that they can win . <p> The argument that Texans voted Republicans into every statewide office has nothing to do with individual congressional districts . The whole purpose of single-member districts is to represent a local community of interests , not the will of the entire state ! <p> We have two U.S. senators to represent the interests of the state and they are both Republican . <p> I am appalled that the Legislature is considering nullifying the vote I cast in 2002 . If the Republicans want to win a majority of congressional seats , they should run better candidates in 2004 , not rewrite the results of 2002 . <p> Andrew Dewey , Houston <p> Redistricting quagmire / Draw them equally sized <p> I support the recommendation made by Jeff Lloyd in his July 10 Viewpoints letter ( " Redistricting drama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow the voters to decide their own representative , " but with just one proviso : that the redistricting be done without political considerations . <p> Cut Texas into equal blocks of voters , regardless of perceived political affiliations , as opposed to creating oddly shaped districts that are clear cases of gerrymandering . <p> If the state is primarily Republican , then Republicans will get the votes and will represent the citizens . This will force both parties to field candidates that are genuinely prepared to represent their constituents and will give voters a real choice . <p> And this approach will mean that the citizens alone will decide who their representatives will be . <p> Roy A. Constible Houston <p> Redistricting quagmire / Do n't leave us all high , dry <p> Thanks to the Chronicle for its editorial opposition to the plans to redistrict the Texas delegation to the U.S. House . It makes no sense for anyone in Houston and Harris County to support this proposed redistricting plan . Why would a Houstonian have any wish to be represented by someone living in far East Texas or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This would strip our area of capable representation in Washington when we need it most . <p> H.D. Dunn , Houston <p> Redistricting quagmire / Follow the letter of the law <p> Jeff Lloyd 's July 9 Viewpoints letter was right : Gov . Perry does not care that the editorial positions of most of the state 's major newspapers oppose redistricting . The majority of Texans want the Texas Constitution to be followed to the letter of the law . Redistricting must be done by the Legislature and it should represent the majority of the voters . <p> James E McDonald , Houston <p> Consumer finance industry 's democratization of credit helps all America <p> The claims made by Maria Polanco in her July 7 Outlook article , " Latinos the biggest prey of sub-prime loan sharks , " about Wells Fargo Financial 's business practices , were quite distorted . It was obvious Polanco had no understanding of how we do business at Wells Fargo Financial , nor does she seem to appreciate the great value that the consumer finance industry brings to millions of Americans . <p> Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the customer or it wo n't be approved . The benefit could be reducing the customer 's interest rate , monthly payment or total amount of payments , helping correct a delinquency on a previous real estate-secured loan or converting an adjustable-rate mortgage to a fixed rate so the customer can benefit from the security of a set monthly payment . <p> We lend only to customers who have demonstrated an ability to repay the loan . To do otherwise would not be in the customers ' best interests or ours . <p> We want to build relationships - not just make transactions . <p> Our prices are fully disclosed and competitive . <p> We do not tolerate any attempt to sell a customer any product or service unless the terms are clearly disclosed - period . <p> Making good , solid loans is one priority . Taking extra steps to keep our customers in their homes is another . <p> We have practices in place to keep foreclosures at a minimum , including a responsible lending review that is applied before foreclosing on any loan . <p> As a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also eliminated single premium credit insurance on mortgage loans altogether . <p> We are not perfect . We 're a company of human beings , and human beings make mistakes . But when we find a mistake or one is called to our attention , we carefully research it and try to do what is right and best for the customer . <p> Most of our 5 million customers are typical American wage earners . We help them gain access to credit so they can use that money in all sorts of ways to improve their lives . They may be buying appliances and furniture , cars , remodeling their homes , financing educations or paying for vacations . They may also be consolidating their bills to lower monthly payments . <p> But they 're not necessarily " low-income " - every customer is different and has unique needs . <p> Wells Fargo &; Co. , of which we are a part , is recognized as the nation 's No. 1 provider of home loans to Latino and other ethnic minority borrowers , as well as to low-to-moderate income borrowers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be among the best at developing solutions to help our customers overcome barriers to homeownership and stay in their homes . <p> Pricing for consumer finance is just like pricing for insurance : the greater the risk the higher the price . We do not price in a vacuum , but to be competitive . That 's why we 've reduced prices repeatedly , reflecting lower costs and in response to other marketplace conditions . <p> Consumer finance is a relationship business . We keep the best interests of our customers foremost , provide them with complete information and establish long-term relationships . <p> The only way a business can grow and earn a legitimate profit for the services provided is to do what is right for each customer . <p> The consumer finance industry has given credit access to millions of Americans . This democratization of credit has resulted in higher standards of living , increased homeownership and a strong middle class . <p> Roger V. King , senior vice president and division manager , U.S. Consumer Division , Wells Fargo Financial , Inc. , Englewood , Colo . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julie Turbeville been ( July 9 Viewpoints letter , " Beach etiquette rebuttal " ) ? She seems to think that just because she purchased a piece of property overlooking sand dunes , the beach and the Gulf of Mexico , that she is entitled to some type of personal agenda . It does n't work that way . <p> The people Turbeville complained about have just as much right to the public domain as she does , regardless of how she feels or what she thinks about it . <p> I moved to Port O'Connor 30 years ago for privacy , peace and quiet , good fishing and clean beaches . <p> Since then , I have been inundated by people building houses anywhere there is an open space . On weekends and holidays , our once great fishing attracts the biggest slobs and the most obnoxious of the affluent from nearby cities . Now , my options are the same as Turbeville 's : Grin and bear it or move . <p> Richard Hindman , Port O'Connor <p> No jingoism on immigration policy <p> I was confused by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control of borders " ) . Was she being sarcastic when she wrote that a sure way to " bring this nation to ruin would be to allow it to become a majority of people with origins from some other nation " ? <p> I burst out laughing ! This had to be a joke , right ? <p> Where does she think the present population of this nation came from , Jupiter ? Unless of Native-American origin , everyone in this country came from somewhere else . <p> I think we can make a better case on our immigration policies without resorting to the sort of jingoism that seems to be popular these days . <p> Clancy Weeks , Spring <p> It 's a mystery about gambling <p> Driving back to Houston after a weekend at the casinos in Louisiana , I started thinking about Texas ' current fiscal crisis . Casino parking lots in Louisiana were full of Texas cars and I was passed in both directions by casino buses making the trip from Texas to Louisiana . <p> Why do Texas lawmakers continue to deny native-Americans the opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the gambling because we have the state lottery and both dog and horse racing . It 's is a mystery to me . <p> Milton Witt , Houston <p> Vaccination exemptions parents ' right <p> Thanks to the Chronicle for its coverage of the very important issue of Texas ' new laws for conscientious exemptions for vaccinations ( July 4 article , " Vaccination exemptions for children stir concern " ) . As the mother of four children , this is an issue near and dear to my heart . I believe that decisions about medical treatments for my children should be decided by our family and our children 's doctor , not the government . The new law will assure us that right , free from harassment by the government . <p> Lana C. Hicks , Pasadena
