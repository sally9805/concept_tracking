" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My president has been shot . " // That day Laurent-Dsir Kabila , who since 1997 had assumed dictatorial powers over Congo , reportedly had been murdered by his bodyguard . Mutombo endured sleepless nights last week , phoning his native country for assurances that the streets were quiet and that his family  --  including a brother who lives a few blocks from the presidential palace in Kinshasa  --  was safe . " It 's a very sad day for me , " Mutombo said last Friday , near tears as he discussed the assassination . " It 's sad the way we are now in Africa , the way people are dying . " // Mutombo has his size-22 feet planted in two enormously different worlds  --  one in Congo , where he is trying to build a desperately needed 300-bed hospital , at a cost of $44 million ; the other in the NBA , where he is expected to command a five-year contract worth more than $75 million next season . As one of the marquee free agents this summer ( along with the Kings ' Chris Webber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 2 " Mutombo has been the subject of trade rumors for the last year . The Hawks have discussed dealing him to a half dozen suitors , including the Knicks  --  who have not formally offered Latrell Sprewell , Allan Houston or Marcus Camby in return , reports to that effect notwithstanding . // Barring a move by the Feb. 15 trade deadline , Mutombo will spend the rest of the season in Atlanta . " Ideally , we would like Dikembe to finish his career with us , " says Hawks G.M. Pete Babcock . Mutombo , 34 , who is building a home in suburban Atlanta , could demand a sign-and-trade deal . He remains disappointed in the Hawks ' management , which in the summer of 1999 dismantled a team that had gone 137-77 in the three years after Mutombo signed as a free agent . The key trade was Steve Smith and Ed Gray to the Trail Blazers for Jim Jackson and Isaiah Rider . Despite that move and others , Mutombo says with a laugh , " I love the city . " // At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade , but team president Stan Kasten believes the Hawks ' fortunes are changing . After a 1-10 start this season  --  attributable in large part to Mutombo 's missing the first five games with malaria and his sub-par performance as he recovered  --  the young Hawks had gone 13-15 through Sunday . That they stood only 4 games out of the final playoff spot in the East was due mainly to Mutombo . Like the last survivor of a royal family , he is the only dominating seven-footer in the conference . Despite career lows in points per game ( 8.3 ) and shooting ( 44.2% ) through Sunday , he was averaging an NBA-leading 13.9 rebounds and blocking 2.32 shots to earn his $14.4 million salary . // The hardest thing for young players to learn is team defense , but Mutombo 's regal presence is helping erase a lot of mistakes and keeping the Hawks in games . The recent emergence of Lorenzen Wright as the starting power forward can be attributed to his partnership with the big man . " I 've seen that relationship progressing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got a lot of room for error because we know he 's sitting back there . " // Mutombo will never be the focal point of Atlanta 's attack , but he has avoided serious injury and runs the floor well for his age  --  whatever it is . " Assistant coach Rick Mahorn is always joking that Deke is 42 , that no one 's ever seen his birth certificate , " Wright says . " I always figured he was 31 or something . " // Mutombo appears to enjoy his leadership role and Kruger 's enthusiastic , high-energy practices . " The progress we have made lately has been very positive , " Mutombo says . " I am going to make my decision after I see how much progress has been made and how we finish . " // The money will matter too . Mutombo intends to add to the $3 million he has invested in the planned hospital in Kinshasa . " I want to accomplish something bigger than me , " he says . He is also seeking donations  --  his fellow Georgetown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not want to rely too much on corporate support After the hospital has been running a couple of years , he wants to be free to turn control over to a church or other nonprofit organization . // Whatever Mutombo earns or does in the NBA , it will do little to ease the pain he feels when he ponders the wars , poverty and disease that plague Africa . " Killing somebody or invading a country has become too easy , " he says . " I can build a hospital , but how are the people going to use it if the road to it has been destroyed by days and nights of bombing ? " // The Development League A Very Minor Minor League // Faced with diminishing fan interest , league executives are finally acknowledging that the game 's pace and flow were indeed more appealing during the Bird-Magic era of the 1980s . As tedious one-on-one play proliferates , commissioner David Stern and others are publicly discussing whether to allow zone defenses . Further , in light of what appears to be one of the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than ever that many of the young players entering the league are not capable of competing . " If it were up to us , we would like to see a situation in which a player under age 20 could not play in the NBA , period , " Granik says . // Granik raises the issue of minimum age knowing he would have to persuade the players ' association to accept one . " It 's been informally brought up with the union in the last several weeks , and the reaction we got is that nothing has changed , " Granik says . " We hope to discuss it again in the near future . " // The facts of collectively bargained life have helped shape the National Basketball Development League , or D League , some details of which NBA officials hope to reveal during All-Star weekend . It will make its debut in November with eight teams playing in roughly 5,000-seat gyms , and it will be based in small cities in the southeast , like Fayetteville , N.C. , the only town awarded a franchise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 24 of which will be shown on ESPN . While salaries will be roughly $30,000 , officials hope the D League will be more attractive to players than the CBA , IBL , ABA and overseas leagues because of its sponsorship by the NBA , which will use it to train not only players but also coaches , refs and executives . // The D League will , however , be a far cry from a true farm system , like baseball 's . Under the collective bargaining agreement , it can not serve as a place for NBA players to rehab injuries or to polish their skills , nor can it be a place for top prospects such as Jazz rookie DeShawn Stevenson to get seasoning . Indeed , high school draftees like Stevenson wo n't be eligible : The age minimum of 20 will apply in the D League . Teams will be unaffiliated with NBA franchises ; the talent pool will consist entirely of undrafted players and free agents , who could be claimed by any NBA team . // Over time , the D League could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a traditional farm system  --  the players ' association permitting . " There should be a decided effort to have people under 25 or 27 " , says Lakers coach Phil Jackson , who coached in the CBA in the 1980s . " The NBA , which allows 15-man rosters , should have 12-man rosters , and those three kids sitting on the end of the bench in street clothes should be in that league . Not the whole season , but they should be allowed to go down there for 10 or 15 or 20 games . I hope for the sake of basketball that it works . But it 's a long shot . " // Though the NBA set the D League 's minimum age at 20 because it does n't want to compete with colleges for talent , Granik says the minimum might one day be lowered to accommodate high school grads . While appearing in November before the Knight Commission , the blue-ribbon panel that is investigating college sports , Granik was implored by NCAA president Cedric Dempsey and other commission members to consider 18 as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would provide a home for players with no interest in a college education . // Practice Facilities Worth a Kings ' Ransom ? // The Kings recently unveiled a $9.1 million practice facility next to Arco Arena , and the timing could n't be better : Management hopes to persuade Chris Webber to remain in Sacramento when he becomes a free agent this summer . The prospect of Webber 's doing so would not be bright if the team was still practicing at California Highway Patrol Headquarters , the Salvation Army gym , McClellan Air Force Base or Natomas High School , which have been among the Kings ' 12 temporary training sites over the past 16 years . // Brian Grant , a former King who did n't enjoy that aspect of playing in Sacramento , says he was drawn to Miami after touring the Heat 's practice facility at American Airlines Arena . The separate gym features one-and-a-half courts , a private underground parking lot and a view of Biscayne Bay through an enormous picture window . // Kevin Garnett often arrives at midnight at the Timberwolves ' practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that feeds him the ball . " There 's no limitation on when the players can use it , " says coach Flip Saunders . " Anytime you have something of your own , it 's always better . It 's like owning a house instead of renting . You bring a free agent in and let him know he can use this to become a better player . " // Such facilities are undoubtedly appealing , but do they make a difference ? When the Spurs open their private facility this summer , only four teams will be without one , and three of them are winners . The 76ers share their practice court with the students of the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine ; the Knicks work out at SUNY-Purchase , though they are committed to building their own site ; and the Jazz shares its practice facility with the employees of the Franklin Covey company , which makes day planners . The other team that does n't have a private facility and has no plans to build one is  --  predictably  --  the Clippers , who have adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Box Score Mason Jarred // Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy effectively shut down the Heat last Thursday with the masterstroke of playing massive 7 ' 3 " center Arvydas Sabonis on 6 ' 8 " forward Anthony Mason . As Miami stubbornly continued to play through Mason in the low post , its shooting percentage plummeted . Mason , the Heat 's most consistent scorer in recent weeks , missed his first eight shots in the face of Mount Sabonis and did not connect from the field until making a 15-footer with 2.4 seconds left in the third quarter , which ended with the Blazers ahead 69-52 . Portland won 85-74. // For scores , schedules and stats , plus the latest news and analysis from Phil Taylor and Marty Burns , go to cnnsi.com/basketball.
