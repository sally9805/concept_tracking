He is the Toymaker , the brainy bad guy bent on ruling the cyberworld . He holds conferences with three advisers  --  a steely general , a bald scientist and a blissed-out hippie  --  all played by the one actor . Sylvester Stallone is simply the guest villain of Robert Rodriguez 's 3-D video game , but when the veteran star is onscreen , this Spy Kids plays like Sly Kids . <P> " Actors who partake in films like this or in animated films , like I did in Antz , often say , ' I did it for my children , ' " notes Stallone , who 's 57 but looks a fit and muscular 15 years younger . " Nah . You mean you did it for your inner child . Here I get to scream and act like a total fool and get paid for it . In a part like this , you really have to let loose and not worry that you hear the ' acting police ' sirens looming in the background . " <P> Stallone had mentioned to Rodriguez that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his older daughters , Sophia Rose , 6 , and Sistine Rose , 5 . As the director recalls , " I told him he 'd get to be a hissable but redeemable bad guy and to play opposite one of the greatest actors : himself . We sent the kids an early videotape so they could see how cool their dad is . " <P> Or some might say " was , " for Stallone is at least a decade past his uber-hunk prime . Of his star vehicles after 1994 , the top U.S. grosser ( a modest $45 million ) was the arty Cop Land . His last action film , D-Tox , hardly played in theaters at all . <P> As for Rocky and Rambo : those franchises are sooo last century . Stallone knows he 's lucky to have played two iconic heroes , but he calls it " the esoteric kiss of death , because you 're never going to be taken seriously . It 's like if John Wayne wanted to dance The Nutcracker . People would say , ' I 'm sorry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tutu or how you are en pointe , I 'm not buying it . ' " <P> At 57 , any man hears the whispers of career mortality . " You almost feel obligated to get depressed , " he says . " What nags at you is becoming warehoused  --  having your soul and your ambition put in cold storage . " Your ego too : it 's tough to fade gracefully to character-actor status after 25 years of stardom . <P> So he 'll be starring in and directing Rampart Scandal , about alleged cop corruption in the Tupac Shakur murder case . He 's also defying age and logic by planning a Rocky VI . <P> Clearly , the pug boxer is never far from Stallone . His home is festooned with Rocky arcana , including paintings by the actor . There 's also a photo , taken the day Baghdad fell , of a young Iraqi hoisting a U.S. flag with Rocky emblazoned on it . The image pleases and tickles the star : " You know the movie was n't playing in Iraq . Why would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Dream ? Did he have it under his bed thinking , I ca n't wait to be liberated ! It 's the first thing I 'm pulling out ! ? " <P> In Hollywood , Stallone the star may be history . But in the rest of the world , he still helps make it .  --  By Richard Corliss . Reported by Desa Philadelphia/Los Angeles
