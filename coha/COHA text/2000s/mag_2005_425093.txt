RENT Rosario Dawson , Jesse L. Martin , Wilson Jermaine Heredia PG-13 , 135 mins . ( Columbia ) An old musical beats with a new heart In virtually every musical , the characters break into song to express their inner selves . But in Rent , the movie version of Jonathan Larson 's exuberant pop-rock tribute to the squalid lower Manhattan bohemia of the late 1980s , the characters have almost no outer selves . When they sing , their catchy epiphanies of deep-dish feeling are all there is to them . The movie is literally a series of showstoppers , unified by the impulse to turn life , at its scruffiest , into theater-into a rhapsody of the everyday . Rent does n't look like the sort of musical that would age well . A reflection of the era when AIDS was still a death sentence , it was , like Hair , a contradiction on stage : an adrenalized crowd-pleaser that romanticized the East Village culture of drag queens , drug addicts , holier-than-thou indie filmmakers , and other misfits by doing something they all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rent debuted on Broadway in 1996 , the hipster-squatter vitality the show celebrated was being steamrolled by Giuliani-ization , and my reaction was just as contradictory : I melted at the gorgeous descending cascade of a song like " Seasons of Love , " yet the actors all blended into one another . They were a heartbeat away from the look-at-me " creative " brats in Fame . All of which makes Rent , as a movie , a joyful surprise . The director , Chris Columbus , usually a meister of clunk ( he made the first two Harry Potter films and Home Alone ) , has opened up the show , turning it into a far more varied and flowing entertainment . He lets his camera glide through the East Village backlot sets , luring us to the intimate center of what his singer-actors are expressing . They do n't just break into song-they burst into who they are . What was sometimes oppressive on stage-all that righteous passion ! - is lightened and liberated in the movie , which starts in the beat-up old loft shared by Mark ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Adam Pascal ) , the failed rocker , and then moves out to the crumbling neighborhood , where no setting-a graffitied subway car , an HIV-positive therapy group-proves too unlikely for a song . The plot is little more than a fragmentary series of hookups , but the actors , all but two of whom originated the roles on stage , make their presence felt . As Angel , the HIV-positive drag queen , Wilson Jermaine Heredia has a feline delicacy that erupts into chorus-line jazziness , and Idina Menzel , as Maureen the temptress performance artist , is a lioness in leather pants . Her duet with Trade Thoms as Joanne , her jealous lover , is a high point , and so is Jesse L. Martin 's wistful rendition of " Santa Fe . " As Mimi the exotic dancer , Rosario Dawson does " Out Tonight " with a howl that rivals Warren Zevon 's . Time has been kind to the impoverished but sexy middle-class dropouts of Rent , who no longer come off as Broadwaymall versions of the last urban renegades in America . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through is the beauty of Larson 's bohemia : not to be a rebel but , simply , to be alive . A- - Owen Gleiberman Sidebar The Village people // <p>
