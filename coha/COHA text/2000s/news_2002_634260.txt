<p> As a mother of two small children , I have been fighting to put an end to mutton bustin ' competitions at rodeos . As of this year , rodeos in Illinois that allow this event will be fined under guidelines set by the Illinois Department of Agriculture . In Zay Smith 's Quick Takes column May 12 , I was shocked to see a photo of a 5-year-old falling during one of these competitions , with a caption making light of it . <p> I have footage ( supplied by the organization SHARK  --  Showing Animals Respect and Kindness ) that shows kids being trampled and slammed against the sides of the arena by the rather large , bucking sheep . The footage also shows kids limping out of the arena , hysterically crying and holding parts of their bodies in pain . ( Richard Roeper has this footage , as he did a column on this issue last year . ) <p> Children have been hospitalized because of the lack of safety precautions . . . Notice the child in your picture is not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it or not , the picture and caption give your readers the sense that this event is acceptable and harmless . <p> Please realize this is an event organized by irresponsible parents who are placing their children at risk while cheering them on from the stands . <p> Karen Rappaport , Riverwoods <p> I read that 911 failed someone and Mayor Daley was shocked " Shocked Daley wants to know why/911 failed this woman , " news story , May 10 . What is 911 , except a buffer between the public and the emergency services ? Buffers tend to lessen urgency and delay things . <p> I 'm a middle-aged woman living in the Brighton Park area , and I have n't had reason to call 911 often . However , last summer , as I was doing some repair work on my front porch stairs , a man stopped and started talking to me , and I responded in kind . Then he started coming closer , talking gibberish . I immediately realized that he wanted to get close enough to get his hands on me , and thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was saying . I put my left hand up in a " Stop " gesture and raised the hammer in my right hand behind me and told him to back off . At first he did , saying , " Awww , do n't be like that ! " <p> Then he started toward me speaking gibberish again . Again I raised my hammer and said , " I mean it ! Back off ! " That time , he turned and started off down the street . I turned back to my work , but a couple of minutes later I heard his voice again . I jumped up , raised my hammer again , and told him again to back off and leave me alone . <p> As he started off down the street again , my mother , who had been inside the house , came to the door and asked , " Is he gone ? I called 911 when I heard him bothering you . " I said he would probably be long gone by the time the police showed up , and I was right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the police before they showed up . <p> When I mentioned that it had been about 15 minutes since we called , the officer said she only got the call about five minutes earlier . I described the man as best I could , and pointed out the direction in which he had gone , but I guess they never found him . I 'm glad I 'd had a hammer instead of a paintbrush in my hand . I hope he did n't do anything bad to the next lone woman he came across . Had there not been a 10-minute gap between my mother 's call and word getting to the officer , they might have picked him up . Then again , considering the attitude of the second officer who showed up a couple of minutes after the first ( he got out of his car with a swagger and a question : " What is it ? A boyfriend or something ? " ) , they might not even have tried . <p> I love living in Chicago , and I think Daley is doing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps , that it 's time for law-abiding citizens to start exercising their Second Amendment rights and preparing to defend themselves when the need arises . We do not enjoy round-the-clock police protection as Daley does . <p> Linda S. Wilson , <p> Brighton Park <p> " Shocked Daley wants to know why " is what the headline read . Why did it take 17 minutes for police officers to arrive ? If , as it appears , the officers were negligent , they should be fired and never work in the profession again . <p> That being said , I noticed an interesting quote by the mayor in the article regarding domestic violence . " It is very dangerous . . . . People get killed . . . . They are victims who need protection . " Bravo , Mr. Mayor ! Bravo ! <p> However , while Daley recognizes the need for protection , he refuses to allow Chicagoans the means to protect themselves . Would n't it have been refreshing had the headline read " Would-be murderer shot to death " ? <p> But you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to criminals and not to law-abiding citizens . If you are prepared to defend your home , your family , or even your life , you are currently breaking the law . <p> When will Daley realize that gun control does not prevent crime but essentially guarantees it. ? I support the Police Department completely , but they ca n't always be there when your life is on the line . The only person you can count on is yourself . <p> We the people must stop electing gun-grabbing liberals into public office . This includes Daley and Rep. Rod Blagojevich , both of whom I 'm sure are good people but are just completely out of touch with the real world . These gentlemen have tax-funded bodyguards at their disposal . Where is my bodyguard ? Where was Ronyale White 's bodyguard ? <p> Richard J. Moran Jr. , <p> Chicago Ridge <p> I could n't agree more with Jay Mariotti on the 7-foot-5-inch " Wonder of the World " as an 18-minute-a-game backup " Yao seems like a nice guy and a nice player , but he 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ming wo n't see 10 minutes a game due to bodily and ego injuries . Can you say Manute Bol , Shawn Bradley , Chuck Nevitt , Brad Louhaus , Evan Eschmeyer , Leon Smith and especially Thomas Hamilton ? <p> Shaq Shaquille O'Neal would and could use this Far East clown as a curl bar in the gym . I hope the Bulls are stupid enough to take him if they can . I love watching comedy all year long . Keep it up , Jerry Krause : You are a comedic legend ! The laughter never stops in Chicago . <p> Jay Francis , Cortland <p> A news story on May 4 reported that 18 Americans were expelled from Mexico for participating in a farmer protest against government policies . These Americans " violated a ban on foreigners participating in political activities . " <p> Where are Rep. Luis Gutierrez ( D-Ill. ) and other pro-amnesty public officials to object to this ? Oh , that 's right  --  they 're too busy upholding the rights of illegal immigrants here . <p> Chris Pesko , Elmwood Park <p> Regarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " news story , May 7 : I can guarantee : If a mentally deranged man came walking up my driveway waving a knife at me , and I pulled my gun and shot him dead , I 'd be sitting in jail for using more deadly force than was necessary to stop him . But then again , I 'm not a Chicago police officer ! <p> Robert J. Herman , <p> Willow Springs <p> As you are growing up , if you find yourself to be intolerant of other people , especially children as they grow up , then you should consider a career as a school superintendent . Other qualities such as inflexibility , which eliminates the stress of having to make more than one decision at a time , and a general love of benevolent dictatorship help immensely . <p> Superintendent Kenneth Arndt of Carpentersville District 300 obviously has made the right career choice " Ca n't make the bus ? then you 'll miss prom , " news story , May 4 . <p> Now , if you yearn for a simpler time when school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have the educational credits necessary to be a superintendent , you can become a member of the school board . That puts you within the power circle , and you too can be ridiculed on the front page of a national newspaper . <p> A Christian kid , participating in a Christian youth organization ca n't go to prom , even if driven by an off-duty police officer , because " you ca n't make exceptions . " <p> Charles J. Wilson , Lombard <p> The sports world lost a monumental superstar when the majestic Seattle Slew died . This graceful equine was undefeated prior to his Triple Crown triumph in 1977 . Not only was Seattle Slew a great athlete and ardent competitor , he also shared his financial awards with owners , trainers and jockeys . <p> He never refused to race , nor did he ever demand a trade to another group of handlers . Seattle Slew and the equally amazing Secretariat merit recognition alongside other amiable stars such as Magic Johnson and John Elway . <p> Brien Comerford , Glenview <p> With sincere apologies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not comprehend why the recent brouhaha has arisen over the construction of the male-only Black Sheep Golf Club in Sugar Grove Rick Telander column , May 1 . I therefore humbly offer a very simple solution to quell the angry voices and soothe the hurt feelings . <p> If these empowered , successful , female executives and avid golfers sincerely desire to conduct their business on a golf course , they should purchase land , secure a contract with a female golf course architect to build the course , employ a female architect to build the clubhouse , limit membership to women only and charge members 85 grand a pop to join and $475 in monthly dues . <p> I am absolutely certain that their membership will swell to 200 or more in no time at all . They then can invite any business person of the male persuasion of their choice to golf so they can conduct business . <p> Michael A. Collins , Cary <p> A classy and unique feature of the Sun-Times has been your patternless crossword puzzle on the comics page . Imagine my disappointment Monday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , insultingly easy crossword " puzzle " and the patternless puzzle relegated to Page 71 in the Classifieds . Doubtless , I will have to hunt for it in a different place every day . <p> It was n't broke ! Why in the world are you " fixing " it ? Please put the patternless puzzle back where it belongs !
