When researcher Karen Clark developed the first probability-based model for measuring the threat of natural disasters in the U.S. in 1987 , almost no one cared . Clark , then 30 , started her own company in Boston and used tens of thousands of data points  --  from the wind speeds of hurricanes to the lengths of fault lines  --  to help insurance firms estimate how often a disaster might strike and how much harm it might do . Then , in 1992 , Hurricane Andrew struck , wreaking more havoc than anyone  --  except Clark and her small team at AIR Worldwide Corp .  --  had ever imagined possible . As the toll climbed past $15 billion , AIR 's phones began ringing . <P> Today probabilistic modeling technology is so well accepted that after the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , AIR 's clients immediately called for a new model that would capture the risks of terrorism . The model , completed in 2002 , assesses the likelihood and cost , in human life and dollars , of different kinds of attacks in every part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's smart . " The risk of terrorism is everywhere , " says Clark . " The question is , How much risk ? " This time the insurance industry quickly accepted modeling as the basis for figuring out how much terrorism coverage should cost . <P> International terrorism , as most experts will tell you , is not as unpredictable as it feels . Terrorists follow patterns . And while we ca n't read the minds of zealots , we can get a good idea of what kind of damage they could do in any given location . We can estimate the cost of an attack on a port in Los Angeles vs. an attack on a port in Prince William Sound . We can calculate where a nuclear blast of a given force would kill 500,000 people as opposed to 50,000 . These are the logical estimates that insurers and investment banks are seeking as they try to quantify the risk they face . <P> But while all this strategic thinking is going on in the private sector , the government has responded to terrorism in a less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $13.1 billion has surged into state coffers from the Federal Government  --  sorely needed money that has gone for police , fire and emergency services to help finance equipment and training to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks . That is a 990% increase over the $1.2 billion spent by the Federal Government for similar programs in the preceding three years . But the vast majority of the $13.1 billion was distributed with no regard for the threats , vulnerabilities and potential consequences faced by each region . Of the top 10 states and districts receiving the most money per capita last year , only the District of Columbia also appeared on a list of the top 10 most at-risk places , as calculated by AIR for TIME . In fact , funding appears to be almost inversely proportional to risk . If all the federal homeland-security grants from last year are added together , Wyoming received $61 a person while California got just $14 , according to data gathered at TIME 's request by the Public Policy Institute of California , an independent , nonprofit research organization . Alaska received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than $25 . On and on goes the upside-down math of the new homeland-security funding .
