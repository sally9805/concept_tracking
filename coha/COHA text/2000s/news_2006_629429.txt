<p> A few weeks ago , Todd Johnson was on his way to meet a friend at Kaveh Kanes , a downtown coffeehouse . <p> The friend got there first and called him on his cell phone . <p> " Kaveh Kanes is closed - there 's a lock on the door . " <p> " Oh , my God , " Johnson remembers saying . <p> Shocked , he called the former owner of the coffeehouse , Ben Fullelove , to unload . " I feel blindsided , " he told him . <p> " I was hurt , " Johnson recalled . " It 's like a piece of my life has been taken from me . " <p> It 's a strong reaction to the closing of a coffeehouse , but to Johnson and many others , Kaveh Kanes was a refuge . <p> Such gathering spots are known as " third places , " meaning that home is the first place , workplace is the second and neighborhood hangout is the third . The term was coined by sociologist Ray Oldenburg , who explored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good Place " . <p> Like home and work , a third place serves a vital function in city life , and some say there are n't enough of them . <p> A third place can be a coffee shop , diner , barber shop or icehouse . Each one is unique , shaped by its owner and neighborhood . <p> To flourish , a third place requires a proprietor who encourages customers to linger all day . <p> Can such a business strategy boost profits ? <p> It 's not always a magic bullet , as the Kaveh Kanes experience shows . But small business consultants say it 's definitely good for business . Kaveh Kanes did , after all , have a four-year run . In fact , in many instances , a third place is doing what any operation should do : Offer exceptional service . <p> More often than not , a third-place component gives a business an advantage , said James Evans , assistant region director of the University of Houston Small Business Development Center . <p> " Repeat business is the best kind of business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home , they 'll start bringing their friends . " <p> National chains also realize the value of third-place environments . <p> Cafes in many bookstores now feature settings where customers can take books from shelves and drink latte . <p> Starbucks is considered a model for the corporately owned third place , making its spaces conducive to business meetings and leisure . <p> Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is well-acquainted with the term " third place " and he often refers to the concept in his speeches . <p> " Starbucks stores have become a third place - a comfortable , sociable gathering spot away from home and work , like an extension of the front porch , " said Kim Castillo , Starbucks marketing manager . <p> Purists may claim that only locally owned neighborhood establishments qualify as authentic third places , but a Starbucks can provide a third-place experience , provided it 's in a location that has on-street parking , residences in walking distance and long hours , according to Dom Nozzi , a consultant at Walkable Streets , a Gainesville , Fla. , group promoting pedestrian-friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its success driven by the fact that there is a shortage of third places in the U.S. , " Nozzi said . <p> Local spots <p> Houston does have its third places , and they come in a variety of forms . <p> At first glance , Tanglewood 's Smoothie Island Juice Bar &; Cafe may seem like a typical suburban eatery , but a closer look reveals more . Its most conspicuous sign inside says , " Hang Out . " A children 's corner has two Nintendo computers and a big gumball machine . At another corner , Ken Parsons was typing on his laptop . <p> Parsons spends two to six hours a day there . He 's made the cafe his second office . <p> He does n't mind the sounds of people chatting , blenders grinding and meat patties sizzling . The place gets extra noisy at lunchtime and after school when kids pour in . <p> " It 's life is what it is , " he said . " You get energy from it . " <p> Parsons , a chief operating officer for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen or more people who work there . <p> He and his partner hold meetings at Smoothie Island and bring clients . <p> As a gift , they bought owner Faysal Haddad a white-board easel to display his menu . Sometimes , they use it to make presentations during their meetings . <p> A key to a successful third place is to know your demographic , and health is a big reason many customers eat at Smoothie Island , according to regular Brittany Werme , a teacher . <p> " A lot of people are here in workout clothes , " she said , and they like the healthy menu . <p> Providing free Internet access at Smoothie Island is " smart , " Parsons said : " You 're going to order something to eat and drink , I promise you . We buy stuff here all day long . " <p> Haddad said his business is a success partly because he believes in " treating people right . " He takes that philosophy to the extreme . For example , on Sundays , after he closes at 4:30 p.m. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customer , a young entrepreneur who conducts business meetings there . <p> Smart business ? <p> It 's worth asking if it 's always wise to make one 's business a third place . It 's nice to make somebody feel cozy , but an entrepreneur needs profit , too . <p> It does n't change the basic laws of retail , however . <p> " They ca n't linger and not buy , " UH 's Evans said . " But if they get a cup of coffee and bagel , and later a muffin , and then that smoothie he buys at 3 o'clock pushes you over the top for the day , then it 's working . " <p> Despite the closing of Kaveh Kanes , Fullelove believes that cultivating a third place is sound business strategy : " The negatives are so small compared to the positives , " he said . <p> Five months ago , he opened a new third place in Garden Oaks , on the city 's north side , called Petrol Station featuring coffee , beer and much more food than Kaveh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options will provide more revenue , he said . <p> Call it a club <p> In Houston 's East End , Dunkin ' Donuts franchisee Edgar Timtiman serves mostly donuts and coffee , and his place is often packed with regulars . Some of them feel so at home in their favorite corner that they call it a club . <p> Andres Pena , a longshoreman and a regular for about 20 years , describes get-togethers there as " reunions . " He has two reunions a day . <p> " It 's something like your family , " he said . " We talk about politics , and what the neighborhood needs around here . It 's incredible how much we learn . " <p> Sometimes , he said , people walk in dejected , because they ca n't find a job , and the regulars will give them encouragement and help them find work . <p> " For me , Edgar is the best owner , " Pena said . " He pays good money to the workers , and the donuts are fresh every day . He never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulars are considerate . When the place fills up , they 'll go outside to make room for other customers . <p> Sometimes , they ask for a rag and clean the tables , or ask for a broom and dust pan to clean the parking lot , Timtiman said . <p> The regulars at Dunkin ' Donuts feel a sense of ownership in the place , as do customers at most third places . <p> A soothing haven <p> That 's one reason Kaveh Kanes customers were upset when it closed . For many downtown workers , it was a haven . With its couches , piped-in jazz and subdued lighting , it had a soothing atmosphere . <p> Former Kaveh Kanes regular Todd Johnson owns a flooring business , and after he got a job lined up he 'd drive to there for an hour of relaxation . <p> " That 's where I did my reading and my meditating , " he said . <p> " I loved the guys who worked there . We switched music back and forth . Even my daughter started going there to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and others were upset by the unexpected closing . <p> " People feel like you 've let them down , " he said . " That was their routine for the day , something they looked forward to and suddenly you 've taken it from them . Business is business and it sucks sometimes . " <p> He shut down after four years of operation because his bills kept going up , other coffeehouses took customers away , and downtown was n't a good spot for his business , he said . <p> One reason he 's sorry to see Kaveh Kanes go is that it had a special way of dissolving social barriers within the downtown community , he said . <p> A businessman and bike messenger might pass each other on the street and merely nod , but inside the coffeehouse , " they 'd talk about movies or politics for an hour , " he said .

MAYRA BELTRAN PHOTOS : CHRONICLE @x Of Clowns And Christian Conscience The art of Georges Rouault GEORGES ROUAULT was 34 years old and barely recovered from a physical and nervous breakdown when he had a lifechanging epiphany in 1905 , which he described in a letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day , the artist happened to come across a " nomad caravan , parked by the roadside . " It was a circus , preparing for its next publie performance . Rouaul 's eye fell upon one of the figures : an " old clown sitting in a corner of his caravan in the process of mending his sparkling and gaudy costume . " It was then that Rouault had a piercing flash of insight one that was to affect deeply his vision of Ufe and art . The artist was utterly struck by the jarring contrast between the clown 's external garb and professional accoutrements- " brilliant scintillating objects , made to amuse " - and the wretchedness of his condition as an impoverished , vagabond laborer living on the fringes of society , enduring a " life of infinite sadness , if seen from sUghdy above . " From that contrast came another equally eyeopening realization : " I saw quite clearly that the ' Clown ' was me , was us , nearly all of us .... This rich and glittering costume , it is given to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clowns , we all wear a glittering costume .... " ( Rouault summed up this vision in several studies entitled " Sunt Lacrymae Rerum " - " There are tears of grief at the very heart of things . " ) From that moment on , the clown , as well as other circus figures and denizens of the disreputable periphery of society , haunted Rouault 's imagination and art becoming one of his signature icons . An icon of what ? Of the painful disconnection between appearances and reality , between who we are on the inside and who we pretend to be , or what society judges us to be , on the outside . Rouault confronts us on the one hand with clowns and prostitutes , whose real ( if battered and buried ) human dignity nonetheless still emits some light from within their souls , and on the other hand with the furthest extreme of the social spectrum : the rich , the well-born , the powerful , the " glitterati , " wearing the masks of their expensive clothes and polished manners , hiding cruel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , Rouault 's " The Accused " of 1907 and " Superman " of 1916 ) . Ih his professional Ufe Rouault knew this type well , for it was and is a familiar figure in the upper echelons of the art establishment His own art dealer , the unsavory but hugely successful Ambroise Willard , certainly seems to have been of that ilk . To commemorate the 50th anniversary of Rouault 's death , the McMullen Museum at Boston College has mounted a magnificent , comprehensive review of his prodigiously productive career , Mystic Masque : Semblance and Reality in Georges Rouault , 1871-1958 , on view until Dec. 7 . This landmark exhibition features over 180 works from every period of the artist 's Ufe , some never before seen in the United States . The exhibition was boldly conceived and curated by Stephen Schloesser , SJ. , of the Boston College History Department , who also edited an ample and illuminating catalog that features interdisciplinary contributions from more than 20 scholars . The key word is " masque , " meaning both " theatrical face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edgar Allen Poe 's " Masque of the Red Death " ) . Not only in his clown paintings , but everywhere in his art , Rouault explores-and provokes his viewers into exploring-the private human reality behind the public mask in order to expose the soul . In that exposure , the high and mighty are reduced to the level of the risible , if not the pathetic ( as in his 1927 aquatint , " As proud of her noble stature as if she were stil I alive " ) , while the lowly are made to shine in their inherent human dignity . Again , as the artist himself explained to Schure : " I have the defect .. of leaving no one his glittering costume , be he king or emperor . I want to see the soul of the man in front of me ... and the greater he is , the more mankind glorifies him , the more I fear for his soul . " In Schloesser 's view , " Rouault felt compelled to unmask society 's well-respected and well-born. and to raise up society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rouault 's art comforts the afflicted and afflicts the comfortable . It is an art that a Peter Maurin or a Dorothy Day would assuredly have cherished . With his fertile imagination and years of productivity , Rouault treated many different themes beyond clowns and masks and employed a variety of media and styles . A revelation for me , and , I suspect , for many viewers , is the Rembrandtinspired style of his earliest period , represented in the exhibition by two stirring canvases , The Way to Calvary " and " Job . " But perhaps his most enduring stylistic trademark is the use of richly luminous colors gleaming forth from a heavy matrix of thick black lines , clearly the influence of his youthful apprenticeship with stained-glass makers . The exhibition includes one actual stained-glass window by Rouault , a crucifixion scene , and it is simply a gem in the literal sense of that word . Rouault uses the same stainedglass-inspired style to perhaps its most memorable effect in his many depictions of the " Holy Face , " the face of the suffering Jesus as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which , according to pious belief , shows the true likeness of Christ . The face of Christ is an almost obsessive visual leitmotif for Rouault , a potent symbol of the suffering of an innocent humanity oppressed by an unjust society . Another disturbing existential question is raised by Rouault 's art , most literally in the tide he gives to several of his works : " Are we not all slaves ? " Here Rouault is speaking from bitter personal experience . In 1917 , desperately poor and with a family to support , he was forced into what was essentially indentured servitude to that same infamous art dealer , Ambroise Vollard , or Fifi Voleur ( Fifi the Thief ) as Gauguin called him , a cunning businessman whose ambiguous personal life had much to hide , as Christopher Benfey has probingly written for the ordine magazine Slate . Those who prefer art that presents only what Charles Baudelaire would call " la vie en beau " ( the pretty side of life ) or who shun the examination of conscience might not fully savor this exhibition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will certainly arrest anyone 's attention and ultimately give deUght on some level . For many viewers , I dare say , questions surrounding the moral Ufe , social justice , sincerity and authenticity will likely dominate their response to this exhibition , as they dominated Rouault 's artistic imagination and as they dominate the conception of the exhibition itself . Rouault is probably familiar to anyone who went through the parochial school system in the United States . My own introduction to " Rouault the Catholic artist " occurred many years ago at Cardinal Hayes High School in the Bronx . Yet Rouault himself ( a true believer , albeit not of the orthodox kind ) rejected the very notion of sacred art or the " Catholic artist . " " There is no sacred art , " he has been quoted as having said . " There is just art pure and simple . " Nonetheless , Rouault 's work not only has the power to please the eye and feed the mind , but to quicken our attention to the moral and spiritual dimension of human experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consciousness .
