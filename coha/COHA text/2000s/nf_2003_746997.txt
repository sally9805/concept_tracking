If the third-largest port in the U.S. is too shallow , then dredge we must , says the Corps of Engineers . " <p> A container ship that sails partly empty is a container ship that 's not meeting its full earning potential . That 's been the problem with the Port of Now York and New Jersey : Ships have had to sail in only partly loaded , because the channels are n't deep enough to support the draw of a fully loaded ship . <p> That 's why the Army Corps of Engineers ' New York District has undertaken a series of estuary initiatives with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey , and the states of New York and New Jersey to deepen the channels in the third-largest container port in the nation . <p> Part of this work involves deepening the Kill Van Kull channel , which connects Upper New York Bay with Newark Bay , and serves as the main route for ships docking at the busy New Jersey harbors of Port Newark and Port Elizabeth . <p> Currently , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ container ships now in use to come in fully loaded . The natural depth of New York Harbor is 20 feet . <p> Older container ships , which carry 3,000 containers , draw 45 feet . The newest class of ships , the post-Panamax and super post-Panamax classes of container ships ( so named because they 're too large to traverse the Panama Canal ) , can carry 7,000 to 8,000 containers , and draw up to 50 feet , according to Col. John O'Dowd. commander and district engineer for the Army Corps of Engineers ' New York District . <p> The depth of the channels is driven by container traffic . The Port of New York and New Jersey is the largest container port on the East Coast . Three million containers per year pass through their channels , carrying $82 billion in ocean-borne cargo . It is the largest vehicle import/export handling port in the country , and the largest for refined petroleum products and cocoa imports , according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey . <p> In all , there are 240 miles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Estuary Initiative is addressing roughly 10 miles of channel . <p> The channel is divided into nine contract areas . To date , the initial phase of work in five of the nine contract areas has been completed . In many of these areas , work is ongoing to reach the 50-foot depth authorized by the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 . <p> The Army Corps of Engineers began deepening the Kill Van Kull and Newark Bay channels to a depth of 40 to 45 feet in 1987 , the first phase of the project , which was completed in 1995 . Phase II began in 1999 and will continue until the end of 2004 , at which time the Kill Van Kull and Newark Bay channels will have been deepened to 50 feet . <p> The Arthur Kill and Port Jersey have been dredged to their interim depth of 41 feet . Work will begin again next year to take them to the 50-foot depth that is currently authorized . <p> This dredging project is the second largest ongoing project for the Army Corps of Engineers . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida Everglades . <p> The cost for the port-deepening project is quite high . The Kill Van Kull and Newark Bay piece of the project was set at $733 million , for the initially budgeted depth of 45 feet . The cost to bring the New York and New Jersey harbors to 50 feet is $1.8 billion . The Arthur Kill and Port Jersey legs tack on roughly another $600 million . The Corps and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey are sharing costs for the project . BLAST OFF <p> Where the harbor composition makes it possible , the Corps is drilling and dredging . In areas such as Bergen Point , where the sediment is largely made up of diabase , a granite-like rock , they 're blasting first . <p> In the Kill Van Kull , they 're dredging nine different types of materials , each of which poses its own engineering challenge . What the Corps refers to as clean mud - essentially , mud that is n't contaminated by PCBs , heavy metals , and other toxic sludge - can go straight back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is chief of the New York/New Jersey Harbor Programs Branch for the Army Corps of Engineers . The unclean mud , which is too contaminated to be safely returned to the ocean , is mixed with cement ; the cement binds to the contaminants and keeps them from posing an environmental hazard . This material is being used to cap landfills in Elizabeth , Linden , Bayonne , and the Meadowlands in New Jersey . <p> Other materials that the Corps is dredging include glacial till , which was left by the glaciers as they receded ; red-brown clay , which Seebode says is hard to dig ; and four varieties of rocks - serpentinate , diabase , sandstone , and shale . <p> Seebode is a civilian employed by the Army Corps , as are most of the engineers on the project , including , for example , project engineer Sherif Guirguis and team leader Sam Di Dato . <p> In the Kill Van Kull , one of the contractors carrying out the work for the Army Corps , Great Lakes Dredge and Dock Co. of Oak Brook , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's largest backhoe dredge . The backhoe dredge New York is outfitted with a 13-cubic-yard bucket for digging through heavy-duty material . It pulls up more than a garbage truck 's worth of material in a single pass , Seebode said . The dredge can support up to a 25-yard bucket and , depending on the boom in use , can dig to a depth of 80 feet . There are two drill boats , the Apache and MB 301 , and four dredges ( the backhoe dredges New York , Tauricavor , and Mariacavor , and the clamshell dredge Bean II ) currently at work in the Kill Van Kull . An additional clamshell dredge , the Michigan , is at work in Port Jersey at Bayonne . <p> " Dredging the channels poses an environmental and engineering challenge . There 's a lot of blasting , drilling , and dredging to be done , and all that material to be disposed of , " said Seebode , an environmental engineer . " There 's also a social challenge to the project , since we 're working not far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the concerns of the residents of the area , and be good neighbors . " <p> Toward that end , the Army Corps outfitted the scows that carry off the dredge material with wooden floors , to dampen the sound of rocks being dropped from a height . <p> The project is using a liquid explosive for the blasting , and trying to do that during the day , so as not to disturb residents . According to Seebode , all of the blasting adheres to or exceeds the guidelines laid down by state and local authorities . <p> According to O'Dowd , the maximum allowable acceleration for a residential structure is 1 foot per second . So far , he said , blasting to prepare for the dredging operations has not exceeded 0.15 feet per second . <p> When all the work is done , the New York/New Jersey harbor will once again be deep enough to support fully loaded container ships , maintaining the port 's viability . <p> The Army Corps of Engineers Harbor Estuary Initiative involves dredging roughly 10 miles of shipping channels between New York and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . <p> The backhoe dredge New York has been outfitted with a 13-cubic-yard bucket for digging through heavy-duty material . <p> The backhoe dredge New York has been described as the world 's largest of its kind . It is one of four dredges currently at work in the Kill Van Kull . <p> By Gayle Ehrenman <p> SHAKE , RATTLE , AND ROLL <p> Dredging may look easy work , since it 's the equipment that does all the heavy lifting . A visit out to the dredge New York with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers quickly changed my mind . Operating a dredge takes a lot of concentration in addition to a strong constitution . <p> The dredge , which was digging up rock in the Kill Van Kull near the Bayonne Bridge is a huge , noisy , behemoth of a machine , with " Liebherr " printed across its back , the name of a company known for massive machines , The dredge operator sits in relative comfort in an air-conditioned cabin , about 30 feet up from the deck of the ship . Relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's quieter in the cabin than anywhere else on the dredge , the vibrations up there are fierce . I hung onto a cabinet bolted to the wall , lest I be tossed way down to the greasy deck below . <p> The dredge operator works a marathon 12-hour shift up in the cabin , leaving only for a lunch break . He operates the dredge via a joystick , like the one kids use to navigate through a video game . And , like a video game , all the real action in the dredge operator 's cabin is visible onscreen . In this case , it 's a series of small video screens that use GPS-tracking to show the operator exactly where he 's digging , where he 's finished digging , and how deep he 's going . It 's hard to believe that such precision can survive in the face of such fierce vibrations . - Gayle Ehrenman <p>
