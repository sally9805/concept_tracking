( And how to tell if your baby 's on track ) Every milestone  --  from when your baby first holds up her sweet little head to when she speaks her first word  --  is thrilling . These moments are n't just exciting and fun ; they 're also markers that can clue you in to your baby 's development . Most parents already know to look for the much-lauded ones , like rolling over and walking . But of the multitude of milestones cited by the American Academy of Pediatrics , some are considered more significant . Here , 10 milestones that are worth paying a little extra attention to during your child 's first two years : 1 EYE CONTACT BETWEEN 6 AND 8 WEEKS This is one of the first milestones you 'll notice , and it 's a big deal not just because your baby is finally paying attention to you , and following you with her eyes , but also because it indicates that her neurological growth and ability to communicate are on track . She 's demonstrating that her brain is registering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , " Hey , I know who you are . " Laura Weber was worried when , at 4 weeks , her infant , Nicole , never met her gaze . " Whenever I tried to make eye contact with her , she 'd look over my shoulder instead , " says the mom of three from Fredericksburg , Virginia . Fueling her concern was the fact that her first daughter , now 4 , hit all the milestones on the early side of " normal . " When Weber voiced this at Nicole 's checkup , her pediatrician stressed that with milestones , there 's a wide range of normal . Indeed , Nicole reached this one at 3 months , the late side of normal . If Nicole had n't begun to make eye contact after 3 months , her doctor would have suggested vision testing to rule out eye disease . The next step would have been to look for signs of attachment or behavior problems . But experts urge parents to refrain from jumping to the worst-case conclusion . " You have to be very cautious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to be taken in context with so many other things , " says Martin Stein , M.D. , director of developmental-behavioral pediatrics at Rady Children 's Hospital San Diego . The more likely reason for no eye contact is that you 're looking at the wrong times . " An infant needs to be in a quiet but alert mental state to respond in this way , and most of the time an infant is awake she 's tired or hungry , " says Dr. Stein . The lesson ? Be patient , and keep your eyes open . 2 SOCIAL SMILE BETWEEN 6 AND 8 WEEKS This is n't the spontaneous smile that happens when your few-hours-old infant passes gas or your 3-week-old grins at the ceiling . A social smile is reciprocal , meaning your baby smiles in response to someone else 's smile . It 's a sign that several different parts of the brain are maturing . It says he 's able to see short distances , make sense of an object ( in this case a smiling face ) , and produce his own smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since it 's one of the first forms of communication between parent and child . If despite your encouraging grins you do n't notice a social smile by 3 months , bring it up with your pediatrician ; rarely this can signal eye problems or an attachment disorder . Again , being patient and looking for times when your baby is well rested may be all it takes to see him smile . 3 COOING AROUND 8 WEEKS During your baby 's first several weeks , she communicates mainly by crying . But around 8 weeks , there 's a lot of activity that begins to take place in the brain 's front temporal lobe ( the brain 's speech center ) that lets your baby coo . " I often half jokingly say that if she has a social smile , can follow movement with her eyes , and can coo , it means she has the ability to go to college , since there 's so much that has to be working right in the brain for these things to occur , " says Dr. Stein . When she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create vowel sounds like ah-ah-ah and oh-oh-oh . Try talking back , and she may respond with another ah-ah-ah . Do n't expect your infant to coo on cue though ; she still needs time to master her coo conversation . One of the best things you can do to promote this is to narrate your life : " Mommy is putting on your shoes so we can go to the park . Do you like the park ? " Whatever you talk about , your baby just loves the sound of your voice . If she does n't spontaneously coo by 3 months , check with your doctor , who 'll likely run hearing tests . 4 BABBLING 3 TO 4 MONTHS Eventually your baby will move on to babbling . This is different from cooing because it requires using the tongue and the front of the mouth ( rather than the throat ) to make sounds like nah-nah-nah and bah-bah-bah . Different situations inspire babbling in different babies . For Erin England Acosta 's daughter , Samantha , a change of scenery seemed to be all it took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daycare at 6 months , and after the first week , she was babbling up a storm , " says the Orange , California , mom . Once your baby begins babbling , she 'll likely want to try out her newly acquired skill  --  a lot . This practice will ultimately bring her to the next significant milestone at 6 to 8 months : reciprocal babbling . This shows that she 's learned she can respond to another person 's voice by using her own  --  a crucial first step in early language . If you do n't hear babbling by the time your baby is 6 months , talk with your pediatrician to discuss your concerns . 5 REACHING AND GRABBING BETWEEN 5 AND 7 MONTHS " When a child begins to reach and grab , it says she can act intentionally on the world , " says Claire Lerner , director of parenting resources for Zero to Three , a national nonprofit organization devoted to promoting healthy development for infants and toddlers . " It shows desire , interest , and curiosity , which are all critical for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on the floor with your baby and place a favorite toy just out of reach . The more opportunities you create , the more you engage her senses and entice her to touch , smell , look , and learn about objects . 6 PULLING UP TO A STAND 9 TO 10 MONTHS One of the first signs that your baby is getting ready to walk is that he begins to pull himself up to a standing position . " This is one of the most important gross motor large muscle milestones because it shows the stability and strength of the legs and trunk , which are both necessary for walking , " says Dr. Stein . It also shows that your child has the motivation to reach a goal  --  to get to that red block sitting on the coffee table , for instance . To help your child learn to pull himself up , it 's a good idea to give him lots of time to be unencumbered  --  to limit the time he spends in the car seat , stroller , and such . At age 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 , was n't making any attempts to pull herself up to a stand . " In fact , she was n't even crawling , " says the Westfield , New Jersey , mom of three . So Katie 's pediatrician recommended she be evaluated by an occupational therapist , who concluded there was nothing hindering her ability to crawl or walk . The therapist suggested that Hoskins-Clark simply needed to entice Katie to crawl , pull up to a stand , and walk ( instead of carrying her everywhere , which she was prone to do ) , by encouraging her to come and get her favorite toy or sippy cup . Sure enough , at 14 months , Katie started to crawl . Around 16 months she started to pull up to a stand , and was walking at 19 months . 7 PINCER GRASP 9 TO 11 MONTHS There 's the crude pincer grasp that occurs around 7 or 8 months , when babies use all of their fingers and their thumb to pick up a spoon or toy . Then , a few months later , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neatly take their thumb and forefinger to pick up one Cheerio or one piece of a puzzle . " Getting the pincer grasp is one of the biggest keys to independence , " says Lerner . " Eventually , a child will use this grasp to do essential things like feed and dress herself and brush her teeth . " Encouraging this skill is as simple as letting your child hang out in her high chair with a few Cheerios or crackers . What if she is n't catching on ? Give it time . Only if your child is n't using the pincer grasp by 12 months should you get an evaluation to assess her fine motor skills . 8 GESTURING AROUND 12 MONTHS When your child has eaten all his peas and motions with wide-open hands " all gone , " or points to his favorite book on the bookshelf , this is a preverbal form of language . Developmental experts say that gesturing is a clear sign that your child knows what he 's thinking , and he 's aware that he can communicate that to you as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'll probably imitate you eventually by doing it back . As with all of the milestones , give him time to get the hang of it before presuming that he 's not on track . 9 FIRST WORD AROUND 12 MONTHS The past months of cooing , babbling , pointing , and gesturing have all been stepping stones to the formation of speech . When your daughter sees a ball and pronounces " ba " or " ball , " her brain is making the connection between that sound and the object . " This also signals she 's beginning to understand that a sound or a word is a symbol for an object , " says Lerner . On average , children begin talking around 12 months . By 15 to 18 months , some kids may say between 20 and 50 words , while others may say only 5 to 10 . At this age , a child should also understand some words , such as when you ask her to " show me your nose . " The best way to promote speech ? Spend time talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent way . If there are no words by 18 months , raise your concerns with your pediatrician , who 'll want to rule out hearing problems or screen for developmental delays . 10 PRETEND PLAY AROUND 18 MONTHS If you 're looking for a little insight into your own habits , look at your toddler , who will often begin pretend play by imitating you . At 21 months , Carina Kilroy would jump at the chance to " catch up with friends " via the family 's cordless phone . " Even though she could speak in sentences , when she picked up our phone she just babbled in nonsensical language , but with inflection . You could tell she was trying to sound just like me , " says her Reno , Nevada-based mom , Dana Kilroy . There 's also a serious side to pretend play  --  it 's critical to building your child 's symbolic thinking . Ultimately , a baby who lives in a rich learning environment will have lots to smile , coo , and babble about . BOX IS THERE A DELAY ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , children 5 and under are entitled to free developmental screenings to determine whether a disability exists and if therapy is recommended . Depending on your state , free or reduced-fee therapy is available . " If you have a suspicion , there 's no harm in checking into it  --  even if it 's for nothing more than reassurance , " says Claire Lerner , director of parenting resources for Zero to Three . " But seek out a range of opinions about your child , and then match them with your own observations . " The earlier you start treatment , the better the outcome .
