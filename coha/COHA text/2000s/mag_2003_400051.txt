Single and child one woman embraces the joys of partnership and motherhood by opening her heart to the people life sends her way // On Valentine 's Day I ordered myself a huge bouquet of flowers-a voluptuous arrangement with stargazer lilies , calypso orchids and birds of paradise-the kind of flowers you send to someone you 're trying to impress . I also ordered a bouquet for the young woman I mentor . Hers was a sweet arrangement of gerbera daisies and mums , fitting for someone who had just turned 16 . Of course , I told Antonio , my florist of choice , that my Valentine 's Day &gt; flowers were for a dinner party . Truth is , I did n't want his pity . I did n't feel sorry for myself , and I did n't want him to feel sorry for me either . Photograph // It has been years since a man gave me flowers on Valentine 's Day . Childless and never married , I have missed two of the big passages that traditionally define womanhood . In a culture that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be whole , where does a woman fit who has done neither ? What I have learned is that not having given birth does not mean there are no children in my life to love . And not having a husband does not mean there are no men in my life whom I cherish and care about , and who cherish and care about me . It does mean that these experiences have n't come in the package I expected . THE ART OF IMPROVISING Instead of a husband , I have what I call a composite relationship , a textured quilt of squares sewn together . There is my friend and business partner , Bob , who changes the lightbulbs I ca n't reach and each December helps me lug in my Christmas tree . There is John , whose focus on exercise and nutrition inspires me to stick with my own wellness regimen ; Ron , who loves foreign art films as much as I do ; Eric , who sends thoughtful and funny Emails ; my confidant and lover , Tony , in town from Atlanta every couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman feel beautiful by association ; Stan , a carefree computer geek who at 30 is the youngest , showing up , if the weather is warm , in flip-flops and shorts ; Keith , who shares his business insights over crumb cake at the local coffee shop ; and Vincent , a constant in my life , a large and special love of more than 20 years . My composite life , while not perfect , meets most of my basic needs for intimacy and companionship . Some women evaluate every man they encounter in terms of his potential as a mate . " Side out , rotate , " they say , if he 's not husband material . I have never looked at men in this way . I 'm not saying I do n't have my list of desirable traits for a life partner , but having men as friends has always been important . I met Stan , for example , on a flight to Ghana via Minneapolis . I was in the window seat , an AfricanAmerican woman , mid-forties with locks , Harvard-educated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying a brown knapsack , easily more than a decade younger , blond , with angled features and blue eyes-hardly my idea of good husband material . A lot of women at my age and stage would have thought Why is this nonhusband-potential guy talking to me ? But I found him more engaging than the magazine I was reading and was open to the connection . It was Stan who first noticed the spectacular sunset outside the tiny airplane window . I leaned back so he could see better , and we sat quietly like that for a while , our heads close together watching the sun slowly disappear . When we landed we exchanged numbers . I returned from Ghana two weeks later to find a message from Stan on my voice mail . With him , I do things I might not do on my own , like the time that Stan , an avid guitar player , took me shopping for high-end stereo equipment . But there is no " boy-girl " element in our relationship , nothing romantic about it at all . Not all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I met John 12 years ago in a workshop on mentoring children . In his mid-fifties , he recently retired from the government . He is a handsome man , caramel-colored with salt-and-pepper hair , tall , with a sturdy physique . He describes himself as " not the man women want , but the one they need . " By that he means that he lives modestly and drives an older car . He is a one-woman man , takes his relationships seriously and does not bail when the going gets tough . I met John at a point in my life when I was in love with someone else and distracted by personal health issues . We had chemistry that I was afraid of , and I bolted . In time , our relationship became platonic . We talk weekly , work out together and go grocery shopping . He is friends with my parents , buying CDs for my dad , who , like him , is a jazz buff . John looks fabulous in a suit , presents well to business associates and clients , and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All the men in my life have stories as individual as they are . Some are ex-boyfriends who after months or years of estrangement came back into my life as friends , and in one case , as a lover . Some shared common interests or causes , and I did not turn away from them because they were not tall enough or handsome enough or because they made less money than I did . A couple had crushes on me that were not mutual . It took patience to transform these relationships into warm friendships , but they have been well worth it . THE TRUTH ABOUT QUILTING Many women I know , who by choice or circumstance have never married , have woven quilts of their own . Melissa , a 43-year-old lawyer , is gregarious and easy to be around , drawing people like a magnet . Her best friend and constant companion is a gay man , Brent . A few months ago they hosted a jazz night at Brent 's apartment , and last Easter I joined them and a large circle of their friends for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brent out to Santa Fe when he moves there later this year . Evalyn , 48 , my earthy-crunchy friend with locks down to her behind , roller-skates with her buddy Tony on weekends and is dating a man 23 years her senior whose " plumbing is still working , " she says , laughing . " He 's gentlemanly , " she adds , " in an old-school kind of way , " opening doors , standing when she enters a room , keeping her favorite snacks and toiletries on hand in his home . " He anticipates me , " she says simply . For some women there is a downside to this composite life . Kerry , a striking biracial woman who , at 36 , feels that she 's " getting up there , " laments having " wasted time " with all kinds of interesting men who were never going to marry her . " I am always in the eighth month of a three-month relationship , " she says . Over the years , all that time accumulates . Knowing what we want in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospects for finding a mate when we 're in our twenties and early thirties and the pipeline of available men is fullest . This approach , however , may work against us later on . I know that if I restrict my pool of desirable men to 45-year-old , handsome , tall , physically fit , emotionally articulate doctors and lawyers speaking five languages , I 'm severely limiting my chances of finding a partner . I 'm not saying settle , but you may find that having men in your life you care about , who care about you , takes the edge off-even if they do n't meet all your requirements . I find that eligible , successful , age-appropriate men still approach me , and I think that is , in part , because my composite life allows me to have a relaxed , easygoing disposition . So if I do happen to meet " the one , " I wo n't scare him off by acting pressed or excessively needy and desperate . THE JOYS OF MOTHERING In my composite life there is no son or daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been Rhonda , almost 17 now , the young woman I mentor . Her own mother died almost a decade ago , and I have grown to love her as if she were my own . Unlike many women my age , I have never longed for an infant , never seriously considered having a baby solo . What I wanted was a family . It was n't that I was delaying childbirth . I just could n't see having a baby without a husband . That 's different . My friend Katie , a pretty , full-figured African-American woman in her early forties , is putting - her life back together after the collapse of a childless marriage . Each time I see her she seems stronger , but around the edges is a kind of vulnerability , like a bruise that wo n't heal . " My biggest regret , " she said recently , " is that I will never be a mother . " " Not true , " I told her . " What is true is that women like us will never experience pregnancy or childbirth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , but there are all kinds of ways we can mother . And it 's definitely not too late for that . " Katie 's expression grew pensive and then brightened . " Hmm , " she said . " I never looked at it that way . " Many of us know well the feeling of being left out when we hear women say that having a child was " the greatest experience of my life . " What I have come to know from my experience with my protege Rhonda is that motherhood is about so much more than pregnancy . Literally thousands of children need parents , and there is no reason we ca n't be mothers if that 's what we want . THE ROAD TAKEN So , you might ask , is this composite life all it 's cracked up to be ? Am I making virtue out of necessity ? I admit that my life is not the one I planned . But what 's the point of regretting roads not taken ? As my friend Vincent says , " You ca n't un-ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think about what our lives will look like if we do n't marry . How will we define happiness in our thirties , forties , fifties and beyond ? What can we be passionate about ? How do we include children in our lives ? How do we include men ? Like many women grappling with these and other questions , I make my path by walking . Many of us will never give birth , evolve from lover to wife , attend our child 's graduation , become mother of the bride . But what I have observed in women who are willing to improvise is something quite remarkable . We are standing things on their head , rejecting all the labels , defining our happiness in personal rather than societal terms . My friend Anna plans to retire in a group house with her " chosen " family , made up of her best friend , John , a gay man , and Ron and Beth , a heterosexual couple . Claudia , 70 , works out with a trainer , still wears killer heels and is dating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby and then , at 45 , met her Native American husband and had two weddings celebrating their Baptist and Lakota traditions . I , of course , have my composite life . My mother says I should n't give up on finding " the one , " and I have n't . " He 's out there , " she says , and maybe he is . But if not , my composite life is a good one . Recently I came across a list I had compiled when I was 30 . It described my ideal qualities for a mate . Interestingly enough , I find that many of the things I was looking for then , I now give myself . Author Affiliation E.
