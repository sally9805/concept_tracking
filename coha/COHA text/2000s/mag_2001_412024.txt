Section : SPECIAL REPORT Next Frontiers The New Entertainment <p> Still waiting for the so-called digital revolution to change your home life ? Sometimes you just have to take things into your own hands . <p> They said we wanted a digital revolution , and during the ' 90s , the slogans came fast and furious , each more seductive than the last . The 500-channel universe . The wired home . The jukebox in the sky . Everyone can be a director . For years , companies like AOL , Sony , Apple , Microsoft and Sun have tried to sell us on the idea of a world where everything connects seamlessly as part of a massive infotainment universe  --  where you can see any Web site , watch any movie , surf every TV channel and listen to any song ever recorded , all at the touch of a button or the click of a mouse . And one by one , each " wow ! " turned into a " zzzz . " The 500-channel universe ended up giving us channels with nothing on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broadband . The jukebox in the sky fell victim to the shortsightedness of the record industry in the face of Napster 's rapid success . And countless bad short films later , we realized that while everyone can be a director , making a watchable movie is a different proposition . <p> The digital revolution may have fallen short of the hype , but it is far from dead . The same way the Internet grew up thanks to grass-roots users , not corporations , a bottom-up vision of personalized digital entertainment is taking hold in ways big and small . If you have a PC hooked up to the Net , a digital camera , an M player , a digital camcorder , a videogame console , a DVD player or a personal video recorder like TiVo or Replay , you 're already halfway to being a digital rebel . Just look at the impact that M files have had on recorded music , where you can take a CD and rip the songs you like onto your PC 's hard drive  --  or , in the case of file-sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vast worldwide library . With digital cameras , you can print pictures at home or send them to friends via e-mail . With personal video recorders like TiVo , Replay and UltimateTV , you can watch the shows you want on your timetable , not the networks ' . And with increasing numbers of videogames , you do n't have to be satisfied with the levels that the designers created ; you can import new ones created by fellow geeks or assemble your own . The common denominator is you  --  you decide what you want and how you want it . <p> What 's driving this trend ? The Internet has evolved from novelty to necessity , both at work and at home . Slow , aging PC connectors like parallel and serial ports have been replaced by faster , more intelligent ones like USB and FireWire . Digital still cameras and digital video cameras continue to get better , cheaper and easier to use . The M music format made it simple to listen to music in compressed digital formats , and M players let us take that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for portable devices have shrunk in size and cost while growing in capacity . And the growing popularity of CD and now DVD recorders means that we can easily move music and video from the PC , where we create , edit and assemble , to the TV room , where we sit back , relax and enjoy . <p> If the idea of creating your own entertainment sounds scary , that 's because until recently it has been . Using a digital camcorder to record family fun may have been easy enough , but often the process of getting the video footage onto the PC was difficult , to say nothing of editing it and sharing the movies with friends . Sony has taken aim at this problem with MovieShaker , which lets you import video clips , select a " mood " for your video and , at the click of a button , produce a short video complete with music and an assortment of transitions  --  wipes , fades , irises and more  --  that suit the mood you 've chosen . " When I look at entertainment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , VP of VAIO marketing for Sony . " There 's creative entertainment : professionally made music and movies , etc. , which takes creative talent . Then there 's passive entertainment , where you just sit and watch . We wanted to bridge the gap by letting people be creative without requiring a degree . " Sony 's zeal for creativity extends all the way to the PlayStation 2 , says Alex Rigopulos , whose simple yet addictive music-remixing game , Frequency , is published by Sony . " Playing music feels so damn good , but learning it the traditional way is so damn difficult , " he says . " Sony understood what we were trying to do right away . " <p> Another company seeking to bring creativity to the masses is Apple , whose iTunes and iMovie software gets high marks from the Mac crowd . The company has made an immediate hit with its new iPod : a pocket-size M player with a hard drive large enough to store 1,000 songs . Because it uses FireWire , the connecting standard that Apple helped create , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ synchronize its contents with those of your Mac 's jukebox in seconds . The iPod can also store data files in addition to music . " I do n't think of the iPod as an M player , " says Peter Hoddie , president of Generic Media , a streaming-media company . " It 's a hard drive with headphones . And I do n't think it 's an accident that the name of the product does not include the word ' music ' . " Though Apple refuses to discuss future products , the iPod clearly has the potential to become the ultimate portable media player : a tiny , slick device that lets you carry " work " files ( documents , spreadsheets , presentations ) and entertainment ( music , movies and games ) with you anywhere you go . For now , the iPod works only with Macs , but Apple is coyly suggesting it might come out with a Windows version . <p> The place where hard drives may have the biggest impact on entertainment is in your living room , thanks to personal video recorders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because they let you watch television on your schedule , you 'll make hash of the networks ' carefully crafted " appointment TV " lineup , designed to keep you watching , say , NBC on Thursday nights from " Friends " at 8 to " E.R. " at 10 . Replay is taking the watch-when-you-want concept one step further . Based on research that shows that 70 percent of its customers have broadband , the company is including an Ethernet networking port in its latest model . The new ReplayTV 4000 lets you send a show that you 've recorded to any of your friends who has the same device  --  earning the enmity of ABC , NBC and CBS , which have all filed suit against Replay maker SonicBlue . " The folks listed in the suit are among the original investors in ReplayTV , " says SonicBlue CEO Ken Potasher , suggesting that studios are using the carrot and the stick . " They helped bring this technology to market , and they 're shareholders in our company today . " It might be time for the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says the same companies are negotiating with SonicBlue to create new services for TV viewers that devices like the ReplayTV 4000 make possible . They 're contemplating offering viewers a free episode of " Sex and the City , " say , followed by a one-click offer to subscribe to HBO ; or they could serve up racy " Survivor " outtakes over the Net . The networks have a major incentive to try some new ideas : the Big Three lost a record $880 million in advertising revenues in the third quarter of 2001 , a drop of nearly 30 percent compared with the same period last year . It 's possible that they , as well as the music industry , will join the revolution rather than fight it . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : REPLAYTV 4000 VIDEO RECORDER : The built-in Ethernet lets you record The Sopranos ' and share it with a friend .
