Why can you sometimes see the moon during the daytime ? Barry Dewitt Toronto , Ontario , Canada The moon appears in the daytime sky in all of its phases , though it 's sometimes difficult to pick out . The best time to spot the moon in the daytime , says astronomer John Mosley of the Griffith Observatory , is about two days after the arrival of the full moon  --  a viewing opportunity that will continue for about a week : " That 's when the moon is big and bright and in the opposite part of the sky from the sun , so that the brightness of the sun does not overwhelm it . " As the phase of the new moon approaches , the moon is in the same direction as the sun in the sky and becomes hard to detect . The crescent moon is also very difficult to spot . The best viewing time for the just-past-full moon , says Mosley , " is in the darkest part of the sky , toward the southwest , shortly after sunrise . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says they contribute health benefits , but it does n't say what they actually do . Is this a marketing scam ? James Weber Reading , Pa . You are right to question the claims on the carton . From miracle weight loss treatments to vitamins , minerals and exercise equipment , consumers spend billions of dollars each year on health products  --  many of which are unproven and do n't live up to their hype . But in this case , you can rest assured that no marketing team is pulling a fast one . Soymilk and other soy products do indeed contain isoflavones , and most health experts agree that these phytochemicals  --  that is , compounds found only in plants  --  are beneficial . Soy is well known for reducing heart disease risk , lowering cholesterol , warding off breast cancer and easing postmenopausal symptoms in women . Many scientists think that isoflavones are the components of soy responsible for producing these health benefits . Also called phyto-estrogens , isoflavones are thought to look and act like the female sex hormone estrogen . In the case of breast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hormone for binding sites on breast cancer cells that depend on estrogen for tumor growth . Similarly , isoflavones may fill in for the estrogen that is reduced when women reach menopause , thereby easing the hot flashes , mood swings and water retention associated with fluctuating estrogen levels . Exactly how isoflavones work to reduce heart disease risk and lower cholesterol is less clear , though it is probably hormone-related . Soy 's clean bill of health has been challenged by research that suggests soy might actually increase breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women . However , experts say the most recent evidence still supports the notion that soy decreases breast cancer risk . Women seem to reap many of the benefits from soy , but research focusing on benefits for men may soon get more attention . Promising studies are building the case that soy may reduce prostate cancer risk . Also being investigated is how soy may influence osteoporosis , cognitive function and kidney function . Scientists suspect that in addition to isoflavones , there may be other health-promoting substances in soy , including the soy protein itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which makes it a desirable substitute for meats , and soy that has been processed with calcium can be a good substitute for dairy products . Therefore eating whole soy foods  --  soymilk , tofu , textured soy protein , tempeh and miso  --  is likely a better bet than popping isoflavone pills in supplement form . For maximum health benefits that balance the possible risks , experts recommend consuming soy foods in amounts that provide 10 grams of soy protein per day , or the amount in about 1 cup of soymilk . Is the International Space Station visible to the naked eye in the night skies ? Jason McMurtrey Idaho Falls , Idaho Like many other satellites , the Inter-national Space Station is occasionally bright enough in the night sky to be seen by the naked eye . It is in one of the lowest orbits possible , about 242 miles overhead . The ideal viewing time is immediately before dawn or after sunset , when the observer is in the dark and the ISS is in sunlight . Circling the globe in slightly different orbits 15 times a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a 24-hour period . A number of Web sites will tell you when the ISS will pass over your location  --  www.heavens-above . com is one . ( This site has more than 2 million cities and towns in its database . ) Traveling at about 4.8 miles per second , the station is not likely to be over your home for more than about 10 minutes . WORD WATCH Impress your friends with science jargon ! IN SILICO : Why say that you are using a computer to perform a test ? It 's more hip to say that you are running the test in silico . This word is a variation on two terms that came into existence in the 19th century . In vivo , or " in that which is alive , " means that you are experimenting on a living organism . In vitro , or " in glass , " means that your research is being performed in a test tube or culture dish . Now we have " in silicon , " or on a computer . So , for example , students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppose the practice for ethical reasons , can perform the procedure in silico . World Wide Words ( www.quinion.com/words ) , which studies this sort of thing , speculates that the construction must have originally been " a computer scientist 's joke . " But now there is even a magazine called In Silico Biology : An International Journal on Computational Molecular Biology . Illustration <p>
