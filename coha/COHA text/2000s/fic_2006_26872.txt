The Horshaw Ripper When I heard the first scream , I turned away and covered my ears with my hands , pressing hard until my head hurt . At that moment I could do nothing to help . But I could still hear it , the sound of a priest in torment , and it went on for a long time before finally fading away . So I shivered in the dark barn , listening to rain drumming on the roof , trying to gather my courage . It was a bad night , and it was about to get worse . Ten minutes later , when the rigger and his mate arrived , I rushed across to meet them in the doorway . Both of them were big men , and I barely came up to their shoulders . " Well , lad , where 's Mr. Gregory ? " asked the rigger , an edge of impatience in his voice . He lifted the lantern he was holding and peered about suspiciously . His eyes were shrewd and intelligent . Neither of the men looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken badly , " I said , trying to control the nerves that were making my voice sound weak and wobbly . " He 's been in bed with a bad fever this past week so he 's sent me in his place . I 'm Tom Ward . His apprentice . " The rigger looked me up and down quickly , like an undertaker measuring me up for future business . Then he raised one eyebrow sohigh that it disappeared under the peak of his flat cap , which was still dripping with rain . " Well , Mr. Ward , " he said , an edge of sarcasm sharp in his voice , " we await your instructions . " I put my left hand into my breeches pocket and pulled out the sketch that the stonemason had made . The rigger set the lantern down on the earthen floor and then , with a world-weary shake of his head and a glance at his mate , accepted the sketch and began to examine it . The mason 's instructions gave the dimensions of the pit that needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be lowered into place . After a few moments the rigger shook his head again and knelt beside the lantern , holding the paper very close to it . When he came to his feet , he was frowning . " The pit should be nine feet deep , " he said . " This only says six . " The rigger knew his job all right . The standard boggart pit is six feet deep , but for a ripper , the most dangerous boggart of all , nine feet is the norm . We were certainly facing a ripper -- the priest 's screams were proof of that -- but there was n't time to dig nine feet . " It 'll have to do , " I said . " It has to be done by morning or it 'll be too late and the priest will be dead . " Until that moment they 'd both been big men wearing big boots , oozing confidence from every pore . Now , suddenly , they looked nervous . They knew the situation from the note I 'd sent summoning them to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure they came right away . " Know what you 're doing , lad ? " asked the rigger . " Are you up to the job ? " I stared straight back into his eyes and tried hard not to blink . " Well , I 've made a good start , " I said . " I 've hired the best rigger and mate in the County . " It was the right thing to say , and the rigger 's face cracked into a smile . " When will the stone arrive ? " he asked . " Well before dawn . The mason 's bringing it himself . We have to be ready . " The rigger nodded . " Then lead the way , Mr. Ward . Show us where you want it dug . " This time there was no sarcasm in his voice . His tone was businesslike . He wanted the job over and done with . We all wanted the same , and time was short , so I pulled up my hood and , carrying the Spook 's staff in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold , heavy drizzle . Their two-wheel cart was outside , the equipment covered with a waterproof sheet , the patient horse between the shafts steaming in the rain . We crossed the muddy field , then followed the blackthorn hedge to the place where it thinned , beneath the branches of an ancient oak on the boundary of the churchyard . The pit would be close to holy ground , but not too close . The nearest gravestones were just twenty paces away . " Dig the pit as close as you can get to that , " I said , pointing toward the trunk of the tree . Under the Spook 's watchful eye I 'd dug lots of practice pits . In an emergency I could have done the job myself , but these men were experts and they 'd work fast . As they went back for their tools , I pushed through the hedge and weaved between the gravestones toward the old church . It was in a bad state of repair : There were slates missing from the roof and it had n't seen a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side door , which yielded with a groan and a creak . The old priest was still in the same position , lying on his back near the altar . The woman was kneeling on the floor close to his head , crying . The only difference now was that the church was flooded with light . She 'd raided the vestry for its hoard of candles and lit them all . There were a hundred at least , clustered in groups of five or six . She 'd positioned them on benches , on the floor , and on window ledges , but the majority were on the altar . As I closed the door , a gust of wind blew into the church and the flames all flickered together . She looked up at me , her face running with tears . " He 's dying , " she said , her echoing voice full of anguish . " Why did it take you so long to get here ? " Since the message reached us at Chipenden , it had taken me two days to arrive at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I had n't set off right away . At first the Spook , still too ill to leave his bed , had refused to let me go . Continues ...
