In 1970 the typical new home was 1,500 sq . ft . Today the McMansion has pushed the figure to 2,300 . A small but growing group of architects and homeowners , however , is rejecting the notion that bigger homes mean better lives and for economic , environmental and aesthetic reasons is embracing mini houses , which are often under 1,000 sq . ft . Books like Alejandro Bahamn 's Mini House , Michelle Kodis ' Blueprint Small , Azby Brown 's The Very Small Home and Ricorico 's Mini House Style explore how small spaces can be put to ingenious uses .  --  By Lisa McLaughlin
