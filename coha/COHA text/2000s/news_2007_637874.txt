<p> From a coyote 's perspective , Golden Gate Park may seem about as close to paradise as you can get in the middle of San Francisco . <p> Plenty of water . Ample room to hide or make dens . Lots of feral cats and other tempting prey . <p> Two coyotes appeared to be defending the park as home territory last week , causing trouble for some domestic dogs that happened to wander by . Animal control authorities called to investigate decided to shoot the coyotes to remove any threat to public safety . <p> The episode underscores the increasingly urban lifestyle of North America 's most widespread predator species . In fact , coyotes have been found roaming nearly every big American city , raising new issues of wildlife management for cities more used to dealing with tamer matters . <p> " You never know where they are going to pop up , " said Susan Kelly , manager of wildlife services at the Peninsula Humane Society in San Mateo . " If they can find food , water and shelter , they can survive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning has begun for a public education effort tying in with the state Fish and Game Department 's long-standing " Keep Me Wild " campaign to protect wildlife from habituation to people . <p> Though surrounded on three sides by water , San Francisco hosts at least a half dozen Canis latrans , a species capable of roaming from the Presidio to Daly City and back in a single outing . Individuals or pairs have been spotted in nearly all the city 's larger green zones  --  and it seems likely that more are lurking as yet unseen . <p> " You can remove one pair from an area , but if that area is good habitat for a coyote , chances are it 's going to be filled by another animal , " said Don Richardson , a patrol lieutenant from the state Department of Fish and Game , which made the call to exterminate the two coyotes in Golden Gate Park . " I am confident there are more coyotes in the park . Just because we took out those two , we did n't exterminate all the coyotes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the advance guard of a coyote population estimated to number as many as 10 million animals spread from Canada to Central America . <p> Coyotes have been sighted in Beverly Hills and in New York 's Central Park , and at least a couple thousand are said to be living in metropolitan Chicago , where investigators tagged one female that was hiding out during the daytime next to a busy sidewalk outside a large downtown post office . <p> Serious problems are rare , certainly by comparison to the hundreds of domestic dog-bite incidents reported every year . Still , urban coyote problems appear to be on the rise in California , partly the result of an increase in the number of coyotes in areas where people are n't used to dealing with them . <p> In California , 48 coyote attacks on children and adults were documented from 1998 to 2003 , compared with 41 from 1988 to 1997 , according to a report by the University of California 's Hopland Research &; Extension Center . The attacks included children being dragged into bushes , a woman bitten in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many cases of coyotes going after dogs in yards or on leash . In one case , a man claimed a coyote chased him and his poodle , eventually making off with the dog after it was " ripped from his arms . " <p> Most of the incidents happened in Southern California , often preceded by " a sequence of increasingly bold coyote behaviors , " the report found . One " major contributing factor " was said to be " the safe environment provided by a wildlife-loving general public . " <p> Now , San Francisco authorities are planning a public education campaign to ward off more local problems . Conflicts nearly always happen when predators become habituated to people . <p> " The goal is for the city to begin an active program to teach people how important it is to keep the animals wild . We do n't want to make them pseudo-pets , " Richardson said . <p> The controversial decision to kill the two coyotes in Golden Gate Park followed a reported attack on two large leashed dogs at Speedway Meadow west of Stow Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the pair seemed to be showing territorial behavior when authorities spotted them . <p> But reports of coyotes mixing it up with dogs in the park go back at least six months . <p> Richardson , who represented the Fish and Game Department at the scene of the shootings , said more troubles can be expected until park visitors learn to keep their distance  --  and stop making it easier for the coyotes to give up their standard diet of rodents and other wild prey . <p> " In rural areas , a coyote in a chicken house is going to be shot at , so it quickly learns that being around humans is n't good for its health , " Richardson said . " It 's not like that in cities . In San Francisco you have people who go out and feed all the feral cats living in the park . That is one of the absolute worst things you can do . To a coyote , they end up having a huge population of feral cats to eat . And if they do n't catch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave for the cats . " <p> Wildlife trackers profess amazement at the adaptability of coyotes to an urban lifestyle . <p> Stanley Gehrt , an assistant professor in wildlife ecology at Ohio State University , has been studying urban coyotes in Chicago for eight years , using traps and radio collars to follow their movements . <p> He estimated there are at least a couple thousand coyotes in the Chicago metropolitan area , far more than a few scattered dozen expected before the research began . <p> The biggest surprise , he said Monday during a telephone interview , is " how much commingling " there tends to be between coyotes and humans . <p> " In most cases the interactions are unknown to the people , " Gehrt said , describing numerous times in which coyotes were detected within " a few yards or few feet of people , especially at night , without anybody realizing they were there . " <p> Contrary to general belief , urban coyotes do n't seem to rely on garbage or pets for food . Even in metropolitan areas , Gehrt found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplementing the meat with fresh seasonal fruit during summer . <p> They also like to go after Canada goose nests , and will eat virtually anything in a pinch . As for attacks on large companion animals , Gehrt said : " It 's pretty rare , but it does happen . " <p> " Over the years we 've seen a handful of incidents . Coyotes have attacked large dogs , often in someone 's yard . Usually it 's a pair of adults . It can happen at various times of the year , even times when they 're not necessarily raising young , " he said . <p> Such attacks are n't for food . Instead , coyotes see large dogs as competitors they would rather live without . <p> Gehrt , who grew up in Kansas where coyotes were common , said he became fascinated with them as a youngster , and not only because of his own diet of Wile E. Coyote and Roadrunner cartoons on TV . <p> " They were this mysterious animal , something always there but you never saw it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to catch a coyote , but they always outsmarted me . I would n't put anything past them .
