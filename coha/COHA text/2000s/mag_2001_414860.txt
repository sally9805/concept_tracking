// WAVY HAIR THE GOOD NEWS " This is the envy category , " says Joelle , of the Avon Centre Salon &; Spa in New York City . Most stylists consider wavy hair ideal for wash-and-wear styles : It 's not as coarse , frizzy , dry , or brittle as curly hair can be , but it has more body and movement than straight hair . THE BAD NEWS Although it offers the best of both worlds , wavy hair is prone to the worst of both-it 's apt to fall flat on dry days and frizz up in humidity . To prevent limp locks , advises Chris Baran , a Redken design artist , apply mousse directly to damp roots before blow-drying on a warm setting . To fight frizz , says New Orleans stylist Sam Brocato , spritz a light leave-in conditioner onto wet hair , then tuck it into a hairnet before blow-drying on a cool setting . This helps curls stick together . MOST COMMON MISTAKE " Getting too-short layers , which can puff up and make hair look big , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salon in New York City , who suggests layering from mid-shaft down only . Since potentially unruly waves do not typically emerge until a few inches past your roots . pixie cuts  --  like Sharon Stone's-are practically fuss free ( although you will need to be committed to keeping your hair short ) . Longer layered looks ( see caveat in " Most Common Mistake , " above ) are flattering too . DO N'T GO THERE Baran cautions against all-one-length bobs , which he says can end up looking too Roseanne Roseannadanna ( read : pyramid-head ) . HOW TO ENSURE A GOOD CUT Since wavy hair can run the curl gamut ( from loose S 's to zigzaggy curves ) , it 's important for your stylist to understand your wave pattern before cutting , says Elizabeth Edmonds , education director for the hair-care company Zotos International . She recommends you wash your hair the morning of a haircut and let it air-dry .

REAL-LIFE HAIR-LOVE STORY " A recent clothing ad changed my hair-life forever . It shows a beautiful woman with her hair cut in a terrific wavy bob . I realized my hair had just the right amount of wave in just the right places to pull off the " do , so I went out and got the same great cut ! " - Cindy Weaver , 30 , Boston STRAIGHT HAIR THE GOOD NEWS " If you put a cross section of a strand of straight hair under a microscope , you 'd see a perfect circle . Because of this sturdy structure , straight hair is stronger than curly hair , which is flatter when viewed in this manner and less resistant to damage , " says Paul Wallace , senior director of hair-care research and development for Clairol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also the most light-reflective ( shiniest ) type of hair . THE BAD NEWS " Straight hair tends to get oily and limp quickly because it lies flat against the scalp , " says Brocato . " It 's a catch-22 situation , " adds Joelle . " You need to shampoo it daily to keep it clean and give it some body , but you have to make sure not to over-condition it or you 'll weigh it down . " Her solution ? When you step into the shower , first apply conditioner to your ends for a minute or two . Rinse , then massage shampoo into your roots only ( the runoff will be enough to clean the ends ) . Do not condition again . MOST COMMON MISTAKE " Getting stuck in a blunt-cut style rut . People think straight hair , straight lines , " says Joelle . BEST LOW-MAINTENACNE LOOKS Frederic Fekkai , New York City stylist to the stars , recommends a choppy pixie cut or a shoulder  --  length-or-longer style with graduated layers that start at your chin ( think Winona Ryder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Both cuts add surprising body and texture to straight hair . DO N'T GO THERE In general , people with straight hair should stay away from a center part , says Edmonds . " Your hair will just hang around your face like a curtain . " The better options for straight locks : long , sideswept wisps or short , choppy bangs . HOW TO ENSURE A GOOD CUT Since it 's easier to see where straight hair 's been sliced into than where curly hair 's been chopped up ( the lines and angles formed in curly hair never look as precise ) , it 's extra important to avoid sitting hunched over ( i.e. , reading ) in your stylist 's chair or with your legs crossed-this could seriously alter the outcome of your cut . Try to pick a point in the mirror and keep your eyes on it throughout your cut . HAIR MOVES TO CONSIDER " Straight hair is the perfect canvas for playing with color , " says Brocato . Try mixing thin highlights and lowlights to give your hair texture and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , creating extra body . ) Sandra Yu , national technical director at Rusk , recommends playing up straight hair 's natural sheen by using a few drops of shine serum and a flat iron to make hair sleeker .

" You 're also in luck if it 's long enough to put up : " Because of your hair 's great natural texture , up " dos tend to hold better , " says Fekkai . THE BAD NEWS Photograph Photograph // " This is not quick-and-easy hair , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break than other types . And that 's not all : Its cuticle does n't lie flat , which means its core is exposed to the elements-so it tends to be on the dry side and does n't reflect light well , says Christopher Mackin , a hair-care specialist at the Elizabeth Arden Red Door Salon &; Spa in New York City . Because of its perpetually dry state , curly hair soaks up atmospheric moisture like a sponge , and this leads to frizz ( when swollen strands cause the cuticles to flip up ) . Ouidad recommends boosting shine with a weekly deep-conditioning treatment and fighting frizz with a gel-based styler and diffuser ( creams can coat hair and prevent conditioner from seeping in , and ultimately dry hair out ) . MOST COMMON MISTAKE Getting your bangs cut too short ( which can make you look poodle-esque once curls dry and shrink up ) . Joelle 's rule : Never cut bangs shorter than the tip of your nose ; this way they 'll end up at your brows . BEST LOW-MAINTENANCE LOOKS " Keep hair long enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks thick and nice when you wear it down-generally an inch or two below your shoulders , " says Joelle . Some long layers are also a good idea , to keep the " do from looking too round , Fekkai notes . DO N'T GO THERE " Superlight shades make frizz more noticeable , " says Baran . Brocato warns against chin-length bobs that are shorter in back and longer in front . " The curls puff out around the sides of your head and look like earmuffs . " HOW TO ENSURE A GOOD CUT " Be skeptical of any salon that gets you into the washing station before your stylist has had a chance to inspect your curls , " says Detlev Gessner , a stylist at Gemella Salon in Miami . Curly hair does n't grow the same way in all places and may be thicker or wavier in spots , and this may not be apparent once hair is wet . " People with curly hair usually know more about their hair than stylists do , " says Ouidad , who recommends going to a stylist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If it 's your first visit , ask your stylist whether your wave pattern lends itself to the cut she 's suggesting , or whether your curls will shrink up once dry . If she does n't know what you 're talking about , run ! " A HAIR MOVE TO CONSIDER " Many people with curly hair are cautious with color because they think it will dry out their hair , " notes New York City hair colorist Louis Licari . " But semipermanent colors that do n't contain ammonia are very conditioning and help boost shine . " His tip : If your home color kit comes with two bottles to be mixed together , chances are one is a developer ; and developers usually contain ammonia . Look for ammonia  --  free kits , like Clairol Loving Care , which only contain one bottle of color . If you do n't want to change your hue , use one that matches it to enhance sheen .
