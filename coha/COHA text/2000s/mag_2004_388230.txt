<p> AN OVER-THE-COUNTER CONTINGENCY PLAN ? A Food and Drug Administration panel has recommended that emergency contraception should be available to women in pharmacies and supermarkets without a prescription . Emergency contraception , otherwise known as " Plan B " or the " morning after " pill , is a two-drug regimen that blocks ovulation and fertilization of an egg . According to Bart Laboratories , the manufacturer of Plan B , the regimen is most effective if taken 24 hours after unprotected sex . If the FDA agrees with the panel 's recommendation , the agency would have to decide how Plan B is displayed in stores and whether there should be age restrictions for buying it . Barr Laboratories estimates the cost of a single dose of Plan B to be around $30 . The FDA 's decision is expected to come in February . <p> The debate surrounding Plan B centers on the issue of abortion . Proponents argue that Plan B is no more dangerous or controversial than regular birth-control methods since it acts to block a potential pregnancy rather than terminate one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective in blocking a fertilized egg from attaching to the uterine wall , thereby terminating a pregnancy prematurely . Since its approval in 1999 on a prescription-only basis , 2.4 million American women have used Plan B. <p> NOTE TO ATHLETES : EPHEDRA KILLS , MAYBE . Citing serious health risks , the FDA has announced that it will ban the popular dietary supplement ephedra . Used by athletes and dieters , ephedra acts to increase energy levels and reduce weight . But agency officials say the drug contributes to high blood pressure , heart problems , and strokes . Health groups , including the American Heart Association , have linked ephedra to deaths in the past year , most notably the death of Baltimore Orioles ' pitcher Steve Bechler . Another 100 individuals nationwide are reported to have died since ephedra became available to consumers in 1994 . Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson says that , though ephedra products make up only 5% of the dietary supplement market , they lead to about 45% of adverse events , reports the Washington Post . <p> Dietary supplement manufacturers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Metabolife , argues that the FDA made its decision without scientific data , adding that when used as directed , ephedra is a safe product . California , New York , and Illinois have already banned ephedra sales and use . <p> HEADLIGHTS RAIN OR SHINE . General Motors has released the results of a new study indicating that GM owners probably avoided more than 37,000 collisions since daytime running lamps ( DRLs ) became standard equipment on GM vehicles in 1995 , reports the Highway and Vehicle Safety Report . DRLs are headlights that come on any time a vehicle is started and can not be shut off by the driver . According to GM , DRLs increase a vehicle 's visibility for drivers of other vehicles as well as pedestrians . Data for the study were taken from police and crash reports and traffic registration from 17 states . Results of the study varied depending on the type of DRLs involved , driving conditions , and the type of collision . Through 2001 , reports HVSR , GM estimates that DRLs helped drivers avoid 772 pedestrian collisions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported the use of DRLs and in 2001 petitioned the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to adopt rules requiring DRLs on all cars made and bought in the United <p> States . The National Motorists Association disputes the need for mandatory DRL legislation , arguing that DRLs increase visual glare for oncoming drivers , distort distance perception , and obscure the directional signals of oncoming cars . Currently , DRLs are mandatory in Canada and several European countries . <p> READ THE FINE PRINT ON CHEAP-FARE ADS . The Department of Transportation has resumed fining airlines for misleading fare advertisements , reports the Wall Street Journal . A federal law requires fare displays to disclose purchase conditions in a readable type size . In an age of ever cheaper airline fares and free-ticket promotions , the DOT wants consumers to be aware that airport surcharges and taxes can add as much as $100 to the cost of a ticket . For example , the DOT fined America West $20,000 for advertisements displaying fares as low as $123 for a one-way ticket between Pittsburgh and other cities . The DOT found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a round-trip ticket , a caveat not displayed in the original ad . In 2003 , the agency issued five consent orders against airlines that included $145,000 in fines . Only one such order was issued in 2002 . <p> The Journal reports that , in the wake of the terrorist attacks on September 11 , the DOT was more lenient on an airline industry that was struggling to induce consumers to fly . <p> VIRTUAL COLONOSCOPY IS " READY FOR PRIME TIME , " according to the New England Journal of Medicine . Colon cancer affects roughly 100,000 Americans each year and kills more than 57,000 , making it the second-leading cancer killer after lung cancer . But , unlike lung cancer , colon cancer is highly curable , if caught early . Surprisingly , many Americans  --  about two-thirds of those who should  --  do n't bother with annual check-ups and so only about 37% of colon cancers are diagnosed before they have spread . This might be because a conventional colonoscopy , or the method of searching a person 's colon for cancerous polyps , is a notoriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which avoid the invasive tube that must wind through a person 's colon , are not only as effective in detecting suspicious polyps as regular colonoscopies , but in some instances were more effective . The procedure involves a CT scan of the abdominal area while a computer assembles the pictures into a three-dimensional image for doctors to scan . Virtual colonoscopies also take about half the time of regular colonoscopies and do n't require that the patient be sedated . <p> Because the study concluded that virtual colonoscopies are safe and effective , the Journal editorialized that it hopes average-risk Americans will be more willing to receive annual check ups . Doctors define average-risk Americans as those who are over age 50 . <p> THE " THINNING MIDDLE " OF HOUSEWARES . No , it 's not about dieting . The International Housewares Association has reported that American consumers are increasingly buying either high-priced or low-priced houseware products , while middle-price product sales have declined . Specialty retailers like Crate &; Barrel , Williams-Sonoma , and Wusthof have seen record sales , as have value-priced retailers like Target , K-Mart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stocked retailers that traditionally have attracted the most business . Between November 2001 and November 2002 , the IHA found , mass-merchants and warehouse stores  --  the low-end  --  increased their dollar share from 44.8% to 49.7% . At the other end of the houseware market , specialty stores increased their dollar share from 17.8% to 19.2% . General merchandisers and department stores , however , lost about 4.7% of their share over the same period . <p> What does this mean ? The IHA says that consumers are increasingly aware of the combination between price and value . The association speculates that the lower-end and higher-end houseware suppliers are improving their marketing strategies to their shares of the market , while the middle has become undefined . <p> YOU 'RE EITHER WITH US OR AGAINST US . Two major pharmaceutical companies have notified their wholesalers and distributors that they must buy company medicines only from themselves or other authorized dealers , reports the Wall Street Journal . Pfizer , the world 's largest pharmaceutical company , and Johnson &; Johnson say that the decision is an effort to cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country . Traditionally , wholesalers and distributors buy a vast majority of their pharmaceuticals from legitimate drug makers , though sometimes they buy from each other to take advantage of spreads in prices . This leaves an opportunity for counterfeiters to introduce their own drugs or re-import from foreign countries , however . For consumers , Pfizer announced that it would post the names of participating wholesalers and distributors on its Web site . The list will also serve Pfizer 's customers who choose to buy from authorized middlemen . Both companies emphasize that should wholesalers or distributors not adhere to this new policy , they will be cut off as customers . <p> Consumers who still wish to re-import drugs from foreign suppliers will not be affected by Pfizer 's and Johnson &; Johnson 's decision . A Pfizer spokesman rejected the claim that the company is trying to stem losses resulting from drug re-importation , reports the Journal . <p> SHOULD BEER BE IN THE FOOD PYRAMID ? The National Consumers League and the Center for Science in the Public Interest have petitioned the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that detail facts such as alcohol content , serving size , calories and ingredients . Using the nutrition facts on labels of food products as a guide , the consumer groups argue that a similar standard would benefit drinkers who are either watching their weight or their alcohol consumption , reports the Associated Press . Current rules require wine and hard liquor to list alcohol content , but not caloric intake . Only alcoholic beverages that make nutritional claims , such as light beers , must show caloric content . <p> The president of the Beer Institute , a trade association , says that state and federal authorities have regulated beer labeling for decades to meet consumer and government interests . <p> THE LITTLE VoIP THAT COULD . Where once Internet-based telephone service was seen as an unreliable stretch of Internet technology , telephone companies are starting to imagine the next step in telecommunications . The technology sends phone calls as bits of digital data over the Internet and eliminates the need for expensive phone lines . In its early days , voice over Internet protocol , known as VoIP , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Today , industry analysts are saying that VoIP 's early woes are all but gone . While offering a cheaper and higher quality telephone system , VoIP might also open up the telephone industry to small competitors who have traditionally been unable to survive against the Baby Bells , reports the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel . A price war is always a good thing for consumers . <p> Several companies plan on introducing VoIP networks this year . SBC Communications , Qwest Communications , Time Warner , and AT &T; are just a few of the big names that are rushing to get ahead of the VoIP market . <p>
