April 1775 <br> Proctor Brown stopped in the middle of bustling King Street , close enough to Boston 's long wharf to smell the fishing boats , and wished he had n't worn his best linen jacket . He rolled his shoulders to loosen the fit , but it still felt too tight . His mother had given him the linen jacket two years ago for his eigh teenth birthday , and he 'd already outgrown it . Taking over all the work on the farm had n't made his shoulders any smaller . <br> The elegantly lettered sign of the British Coffee- House swayed over him , above the door of a narrow bay- windowed building squeezed between aged storefronts . Emily Rucke waited inside . He would be excited to see Emily again except her father was going to be there too . It figured  --  the first time he was to meet Emily 's father , and he would show up in a jacket that was two years too small . A fine impression that was going to make . <br> He tugged the sleeves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A rattling cart loaded with barrels of molasses careened toward him , and Proctor jumped out of the way to keep his feet from being crushed by the wheels . <br> His elbows bumped into someone behind him . <br> " I beg your pardon  --  " Proctor began to say as he turned . <br> A bright flash cut off Proctor 's sentence and made him avert his eyes . When he blinked them clear , four men in the red coats of the British marines blocked his way , two bullies and two officers . The se nior officer glared at Proctor ; the flash had come from something at his throat , but the light faded and Proctor no longer saw it . The marines snickered , mistaking Proctor 's averted eyes for fear . The largest one loomed over Proctor , shoved him . <br> " Watch where yee 're goin ' , and watch yeer manners , " he said in a thick Scots accent . <br> Proctor 's urge to strike back surprised him by its violence , but he mastered the feeling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before meeting Emily 's father . He lifted his head and met the big Scot 's eyes . <br> " Come , be good fellows now , " the se nior officer said , his accent similar but not as strong . " There was no harm done . " The marines brushed past Proctor as if he were nothing . Proctor stared at the se nior officer 's back . The light at the man 's throat had faded as suddenly as it had flashed . Proctor could n't even say what he 'd seen , as there was nothing unusual about the officer 's uniform or its embellishments . As they entered the coffee house , he saw Emily wave to him through the panes of the window . She shimmered like a mirage through the uneven glass . A similar ripple rolled through his stomach when he returned the greeting . He tugged at his collar , which felt as tight as his jacket . Meeting Emily 's father could n't be any worse than dealing with his own mother , could it ? He stepped up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door opened onto laughter and clattering crockery and the scent of pipe tobacco . Dozens of chairs and benches crowded the long , narrow building , with brass candlesticks on every table , though only a few of them were lit . The walls were bare , not that you could see much of them with all the people gathered  --  a variety of British officers , periwigged officials , and ambitious merchants , all talking over one another . Two black slaves , one laden with cups , the other with platters , ran from table to table . The British marines Proctor had bumped into moved to the back of the room . <br> Emily sat at a table up front . She had arranged her cap so that her black curls spilled out of it ; the yellow silk ribbon in the back matched the piece she had given Proctor as a keepsake . He reached into his pocket and brushed it with his thumb . Although she sat with her hands folded delicately in her lap , her large eyes were bright and mischievous . Proctor could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man sitting at the table rose and cleared his throat . <br> Thomas Rucke , sugar merchant . Emily 's father . The resemblance was remarkable for the way it transmuted her own features : her black hair matched his in color , but her curls were his unruly tangle , her round face became jowls and a second chin , and her pink cheeks reddened into his veins and sunburn . Emily 's butter- colored silk dress was even outmatched by her father 's sumptuously tailored jacket and ornate lace cuffs . <br> Rucke 's thick eyebrows curved down in a disapproval that mimicked the shape of his mouth . " Emily , " he said . " You did n't tell me that you planned to introduce me to a mute . " <br> Emily 's cheeks flushed . Proctor tore off his hat and stepped forward , offering his hand . " I 'm sorry , sir . My name is  --  " <br> " Proctor Brown . Yes , I know . I 've heard entirely too much about you already . " Rucke ignored the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his plump fingers at Proctor to take the third seat . " Let 's get this over with . " Proctor bumped the chair against the table , shaking the candelabra as he sat . <br> " It 's good to see you again , Mister Brown , " Emily said , more formally than Proctor had ever heard her speak . <br> " And you also , Miss Rucke , " he replied , in the same tone but with just a hint of mockery . He could see her suppress a grin . <br> " I 'll be blunt with you , Brown , " Rucke said . His hands were spread flat on the table and he stared at them as if he had a point of argument for every finger . " One of the reasons I sent my beloved Emily away from Boston to the more rural climate and estate in Lexington was that I wanted to remove her not only from the tumult and mobs of the city , from the precipitous actions of those pernicious Sons of Liberty , but also , with so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of liaisons that would be ill advised because of her relative youth . But for three months now , she 's done nothing but talk about you until I finally agreed to arrange this dinner . " <br> Not exactly the cheerful welcome Proctor had hoped for . He spread his own hands on the table . " I 'm flattered that she thinks so well of me , sir . " <br> " Daddy , I think once you get to know Proctor  --  " Rucke 's stern look made Emily wilt under her bonnet and fall silent . Turning back to Proctor , he said , " You understand that it will be best if we get this all out in the open and put an immediate end to this unsuitable courtship . " Proctor leaned forward and matched Rucke 's expression . " Sir , I came down to Boston to visit my aunt and for the honor of meeting you . But for Emily 's sake , I would have walked all the way to Georgia . I 'm willing to undertake what ever is necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> Emily blushed again . Proctor would have given her a wink , but Rucke watched him directly , so he held the older man 's gaze . <br> After a moment , Rucke looked away , raised his hand , and shouted across the room . " Hannah ! " <br> An older woman made her way to their table , wiping her hands on her greasy apron . " Good afternoon , Mister Rucke , and the young gentleman , and the young lady , " she said . <br> " What may I bring you ? " <br> " What would you like to drink , dear ? " Rucke asked his daughter . <br> " Since this is the Coffee- House , I would dearly love to have a cup of coffee , " Emily said brightly . <br> " The young lady will have tea , " Rucke grumbled . " Some Madeira for myself . What do you want , Brown ? " <br> " Beer . Pale ale if they have it . " <br> Hannah ducked her head . " As you wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sneered when she had gone . " That 's a farmer 's drink . " <br> " That might be because I 'm a farmer , " Proctor answered . Rucke glanced at Emily and then leaned forward . " Which is exactly my problem with this youthful fancy . " <br> " Daddy ! " <br> " No  --  I did not raise my daughter to become a farmer 's wife . " Turning to Proctor , he said , " Do you think a farmer could keep her in the manner to which she has been raised ? " Proctor leaned forward in response . " Sir , she knows how I live and it does n't seem to frighten her exactly . " " Which is what I 've already told him , " Emily said . <br> Rucke waved this off . " That 's the foolishness and inexperience of youth . Your farm would start to look very small to her  --  like a cage , Emily  --  with the passage of time . " <br> " Oh , it wo n't always be such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rucke leaned back and studied Proctor again , as if there might be more to him than a too- small jacket . " What exactly do you mean by that ? " <br> " We 've got more than sixty acres . With only the three of us there  --  my father , my mother , and myself  --  there 's room to grow . Next year , I 'll buy two heifers for the pastures . And with the fields fallow much of these past ten years , they 'll yield a better harvest of corn to take them through the winter . The stand of trees at the back of the farm has been untouched for a long time too . They 're big enough now that I can cut them down and mill them for a new barn first , and then , in a few more years , a new house . " <br> " You can only get so far with sixty acres , boy , no matter how you use it , " Rucke said . But he was interested . Proctor stole a glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraging nod . <br> " I plan to sell the beef here in Boston and save the money , " Proctor said . " Old man Leary lives just over the hill , and his daughters moved off to Connecticut . Once I 've saved enough , he 'll sell his farm to me and go live with them . Then I can rent out his house and expand my herd into his fields . I 'll be the richest farmer in Lincoln inside five years . " <br> " Ten years at the least , with that plan , " Rucke said . He leaned out of the way as Hannah returned with their drinks . Rucke told her to bring them plates of chicken and what ever else was fresh in the kitchen . <br> Emily poured her tea , saying , " I 'd much rather have a cup of coffee . " <br> " It 's a foul liquid . The colonials would never drink it if there was n't this nonsense over the tea stamps , " Rucke said . He patted her hand . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and found it dark and bitter . Voices rose in argument behind them , chased by the scuff of feet and furniture . Proctor twisted in his seat to look , just in time to see a golden light flash so bright it made his head ache and his hand knot into a fist . The light faded the instant the scuffle broke up , and Proctor saw that it came from the same British officer he had encountered outside . <br> " Do you know who that man is ? " Proctor asked . <br> " That 's Major Pitcairn , John Pitcairn , " Rucke said . <br> " One of the best officers we have in the colonies . Completely and utterly fearless , would charge a line of bayonets with no more than a butter knife . His men love him . Why do you ask ? " <br> " We bumped into each other once , " Proctor said absently . He could have sworn he 'd seen a gold medallion flash at Pitcairn 's neck , but when he peered close , there was nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced away . <br> Rucke refilled his glass of wine . " You 're thinking too small , Brown . " <br> Proctor was shaken out of his thoughts . " What do you mean ? " <br> " With the cattle , " Rucke said . " Think bigger . Do you think Boston 's a big city , Brown ? " <br> " Biggest I 've ever seen , though I hear Philadelphia 's twice the size . " <br> Rucke laughed heartily . " Boston has fifteen , maybe twenty thousand people , and that includes every jack- tar who jumps off a boat to get drunk in the taverns . Now , London , London she 's a city  --  seven hundred thousand people living there , Brown . You could drop Boston down whole in the London docks and not find it again for three days . " <br> Emily caught Proctor 's attention and rolled her eyes . The greatness of London was one of her father 's favorite topics . <br> " You do n't say , sir ? " Proctor replied . <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Liberty are spouting nonsense when they talk about breaking free from En gland . The world 's a big place , but the empire makes it small . We 're all part of one big En glish family , and we 'll all profit more if we stand together . " He swallowed his wine and thumped the glass on the table . " You 're on to something with the cattle . Massachusetts already ships beef to Virginia and the Carolinas , even to Barbados and some of the other islands . They 're too busy growing tobacco or sugar to raise beef , so they pay top pound for it . That trade 's going to grow , and a young man poised to take advantage could make himself a fortune . " <br> " And end up richer than the richest farmer in Lincoln ? " Proctor asked . <br> Rucke laughed heartily . " Perhaps . " With that , he started in on everything he knew about the business end of beef , from butchering to salting to shipping to markets . Emily seemed pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as surreptitiously and enthusiastically as possible . <br> His beer turned out not to be so bitter after all , and before he realized it the pint was gone and he excused himself to visit the necessary house , not just to relieve himself but to relax and collect his wits . If Rucke meant to help him trade beef , Proctor could advance his plan by years , and he and Emily could get married that much sooner . That was even better than making a fortune . <br> He pushed his way between sharp- elbowed men smoking long- stemmed pipes and ju nior officers quaffing rum or sipping bowls of chocolate . He smelled the privy as he passed through the back door . <br> " Look ' ere , it 's the runaway apprentice , " said a thick Scots voice behind him . Proctor spun . The four marines had followed him out the door . <br> " The one too big for his wee jacket , " mocked the huge Scot . <br> They all laughed , except for Pitcairn , who said , " Bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another man with bushy red sideburns seized his arms . Proctor was strong  --  you did n't plow and cut wood and harvest grain without being able to take care of yourself  --  but he did n't react . The last thing he wanted was to return to Emily and her father after a dunk in the privy . <br> Pitcairn stepped in close . " Why were you staring at me inside ? " <br> Proctor glanced at the spot on Pitcairn 's chest where he thought he 'd seen the medallion . " I wondered who you were . " <br> " He 's one of His Majesty 's officers , " the big man grunted in his ear . " That 's all ye need to ken . " <br> " You have the general appearance , " Pitcairn said , " and , dare I say , the par tic u lar arrogance of many of these socalled Sons of Liberty I 've seen around Boston since my arrival . " <br> " Sons of something is right , " the huge Scot said . <br> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one else , " Proctor replied . <br> " See , he 's not shaking or trying to bargain for his freedom , " Pitcairn told the others , almost respectfully . He pulled off his gloves . To Proctor , he said , " I want to show you something . A friendly demonstration . " <br> Proctor tried to pull his arm free , on the chance he could escape inside , but the big man tightened his hold . The other grabbed his right arm with a grip like iron . <br> " William , " Pitcairn said to the fourth marine , the pinkcheeked officer in the brand- new coat , who had so far avoided Proctor . He bore a striking resemblance to the older man , with a similar widow 's peak and aquiline nose  --  very likely they were father and son . " Be so good as to lend me your knife . " <br> " Sir ? " William seemed surprised . <br> " Your knife , damn it . " <br> He reached inside his jacket and unsheathed six inches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge Scot behind him clamped one hand over his mouth and squeezed him in a one- armed bear hug that pinned his left arm at his waist . <br> With a ner vous glance at Proctor , William flipped the knife in his hand and passed it hilt- first to his father . Pitcairn pressed the tip into his thumb until it drew blood , then held up his bloody thumb for Proctor to see . <br> " Do n't worry , " he said . " The knife is for you to use . " Fear knotted Proctor 's stomach . He struggled to get away without striking the huge Scot or doing anything more to provoke the marines . He looked at William , who dropped his gaze and stepped away . <br> A cold smile crossed Pitcairn 's lips . He pried Proctor 's hand open and pressed the hilt into his palm , then squeezed Proctor 's fingers closed around it . The marine with the red whis kers chuckled as he clamped his rough fist over Proctor 's hand . The knife edge gleamed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and held his arms open nonchalantly , stepping closer . <br> Twisting his head from side to side , Proctor tried to talk through the big Scot 's suffocating paw . He tried to push himself away , but his toes barely touched the ground . No jury would convict him for attacking a British officer , not under these circumstances  --  but he doubted any jury would believe his version of events . <br> Pitcairn nodded to his men . The big Scot held him tight as Red- whis kers pulled Proctor 's arm back and thrust the blade at Pitcairn 's stomach . Proctor struggled to divert it , but the knife was already moving toward the officer 's white waistcoat . <br> Proctor 's forearm felt as if it had slammed into stone . The tip of the blade snapped off , flying away to nick the sleeve of Proctor 's jacket . <br> Pitcairn stood there with his arms still open , one eyebrow curled up like a question mark . <br> Proctor panted through the big hand clamped over his mouth . What had just happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat again . Proctor detected the outline of a chain at his neck and a medallion of some sort under his shirt . <br> Pitcairn pried the knife out of Proctor 's hand and returned it to William . " I 'll replace it with a better one , " he promised . " There 's no need , sir , " William mumbled . <br> The big Scot released Proctor from his bear hug and shoved him aside . <br> The door opened behind them , and Hannah stuck her head out into the alley . Seeing the expression on Proctor 's face , she glanced quickly up at the marines and said , " Has there been some trouble here ? " <br> " No , ma'am , " Proctor said . He tugged his coat back into place . " These gentlemen were just giving me a demonstration in the superiority of London knives . " <br> She looked puzzled . Major Pitcairn said , " We were trading opinions . We both learned a few things . " <br> " As long as all the gentlemen are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , and then she tossed a plate of bones and garbage over the side of a small fence , where a pig roused itself from muddy slumber and starting rooting through it . <br> The door closed behind her . Pitcairn studied Proctor judiciously . " It 's essential for you colonials to realize that you ca n't hurt us . " <br> " I had no desire to hurt you , " Proctor snapped . He would have added before , but he was still shaky . <br> " You 're full of spirit , but that spirit ought to be aimed against the French and Spaniards and other godless papists , not against your fellow En glishmen . " <br> " My father fought against the French in the last war , " Proctor said . " We 're not afraid of a fight . " <br> " Do n't be so eager for one either , " Pitcairn replied . " You are fools to think that you 're better off without the empire . Spread that word among your fellows . " <br> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them peeled away to exit through the gate . Proctor turned away to go inside when a hand gripped his arm . It was William , the young officer , and he held his other hand open in a gesture of peace . <br> " The knife was just tinfoil , " he whispered . <br> Proctor snorted in disbelief . " Tinfoil ? " <br> " Yes , that 's all , " he said . " A joke , no harm done . " Proctor shrugged his arm free from William 's grip . " No , no harm done . " <br> " We 're all one people , En glishmen , no matter which side of the ocean saw our birth . There 's no need for us to start fights with one another . " <br> For people who did n't want a fight , they did an awful lot of provocation . " I do n't recall starting anything , " Proctor said . " Now , if you 'll excuse me . " <br> His blood was still racing as he returned to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let another man pass on his way to the privy . He threaded his way through the crowd and returned to the table where Emily sat alone . <br> " Where were you so long ? " she asked . " And what 's the matter ? You look upset . " <br> He slid into his seat . " I 'm fine . " <br> She reached under the table , her fingers finding his hand . He was looking over his shoulder at the back door when he felt her give his hand a little squeeze . " I think Daddy likes you , " she said . <br> " Of course he likes me . " <br> He had answered more than half distracted , still trying to understand what he had just witnessed . He realized he 'd made a mistake the instant Emily 's hand yanked free of his . She pushed her chair back and sat up straight . <br> " It 's nice to see that you 're not too full of yourself , " she said . " Humility is such a rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry , Emily , it 's just . . . just . . . " <br> " Just what , Mister Brown ? Spit it out . " <br> " It 's just that it was n't a tinfoil knife . " There . He 'd spit it out . <br> " What are you talking about ? " <br> " The knife that British marine had , it was n't tinfoil . " It had nothing to do with the knife , Proctor realized . Major Pitcairn had been wearing a protective charm about his throat . That 's what Proctor had seen . It shone actively anytime the major was threatened , even by so little as a bump in the street . " It was magic . " <br> " Magic ? " Emily 's face was puzzled , as though she were trying to figure out if he was joking . <br> Proctor opened his mouth , but no explanation formed on his lips . He 'd said too much . <br> " Hannah said she saw you talking to Major Pitcairn , " Rucke interrupted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which he thumped down on the table . <br> " Dig in . She thought there might have been a problem , but I see that you 're fine . " <br> " I bumped into the major again , " Proctor said . " We talked about London and steel . " <br> " Good . " Rucke squeezed his large body into his seat . <br> " That 's a smart lad . Always make use of all your connections . If you can sell beef to the beefeaters , you 're well on your way to making your fortune . " He cleared his throat . <br> " Emily tells me you serve in the colonial militia . " <br> " Not just the militia , Daddy , but the minutemen , " Emily said . Though her voice was cooler than it had been before . <br> " I do n't understand the difference , " Rucke said . <br> " The minutemen are required to do additional training , " Proctor explained . " We have to be able to scout trails , run longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be ready to fight at a moment 's alarm . " <br> " It sounds like the sort of foolishness that takes time away from honest work , " Rucke said . " And it 's the kind of thing that the rabble- rousers in this colony  --  Otis , Adams , Hancock , their sort  --  are using to raise up the folks against the royal governor . I 'm concerned that you would be part of that , Brown . " <br> Though she sat perfectly primly , Emily pressed her toe against Proctor 's foot to let him know this was an important question to her father . <br> Proctor pulled a drumstick off the chicken , tearing off a piece of the meat . " My father served in the militia , during the last war with the French and their Indian allies . They did n't have the minutemen then , but he was a ranger , which is similar . If I 'm going to do anything , I want to do it to the best of my abilities , just like he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't do my duty to the colony as he had done . So that 's one reason . " <br> " And the other ? " Rucke asked , following Proctor 's example and tearing off the other drumstick . <br> Proctor put the meat in his mouth and chewed it a moment to give himself time to think . He swallowed , saying , " All the men in my community belong to the militia . Not just in Lincoln , but in Concord and Lexington , and all the towns around . So it 's a great means to reinforce connections . That 's how I came to find out that old man Leary was interested in selling his farm . " <br> Rucke chewed on his own food before he finally nodded , if not in approval then at least in understanding . Emily relaxed , taking her foot off Proctor 's . <br> " When you get ready to move your cattle toward Boston market , " Rucke said , " you might want to begin by contacting a man named Elihu Danvers . Danvers has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Cambridge . Though he 's no great sailor anymore , he moves goods around the bay  --  " <br> As he continued with his advice , Proctor grinned at Emily around his mouthful of chicken . Of course her father liked him . <br> She smiled back , but with tighter lips ; beneath that smile lingered worry over his unexplained comment about magic . <br> Eventually , Proctor would have to figure out a way to explain the magic . He would n't be able to keep it secret from her , not if they were going to be together . He reached under the table , wiped his fingers on his breeches , and then stretched his arm to try to touch her hand . A huge ripping sound stopped Rucke in the middle of his description of the harbor shipping lanes . <br> " What was that ? " he said . <br> Proctor looked over his shoulder at the torn seam in his linen jacket and sighed . " That is what happens when you grow more than you expected . " <br> Continues ...  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
