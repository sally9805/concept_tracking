PRESTON CLEARWATER , PREMATURELY GRAY , squatted near a black 1950 Chrysler four-door sedan and , using a broken quart jar , dug a shallow hole where he buried part of the automobile 's glove compartment contents and a billfold . Clearwater wore glasses with octagonal lenses and no frames . He packed fresh dirt with his hand , smoothed over the small mound with his fingertips , and then scattered leaves and pine straw . The sky above was just dark enough to show the first stars of evening , and far across a nearby field of broomstraw stood a long line of black pines , above which lay a strip of yellow sky . " There 's no tool like the fingers , " said the tall , pointy-headed boy leaning his butt against the front fender of the Chrysler . His wrists and hands hung from a sports coat that was too small . Clearwater had picked him up two weeks before . The boy had been standing m front of a grocery store in Smyrna dressed in a black suit , white shirt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and holding out a long red thumb . What Clearwater saw in the boy as he stood by the road was something he 'd evaluated as drive-something smart and businesslike . " Go bring the other car " said Clearwater . " Here 's the keys . " He had n't noticed the boy 's eyebrows coming together until he had hopped into the front seat that day , looked across , and said , " Hit 's mighty fine to be picked up right when you 're praying it 'll happen . It makes you know the good Lord is taking care of you . " But then when the boy said he was selling Bibles , especially given his red-rimmed eyes and a kind of chalky paleness , Clearwater whiffed deceit-and figured the boy might be of some use . For the first few days he felt a kind of kinship to the boy , but now he was n't so sure about him . He talked too much , for one thing . And Clearwater did n't like the way he let the leftover end of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loop . And the eyebrows . He knew a woman with eyebrows that met like that , but she 'd shaved out the middle every few days . The boy pulled a 49 green Ford up beside the Chrysler , turned off the ignition , and got out . " If you 'd left him alone , " he said , " we 'd done be thirty mile up the road . " Clearwater was squatting , changing license plates on the Chrysler . He said , " I do n't want to hear no more about it . " He caught the boy 's eye . The boy , tapping his fingers against his thigh , looked away . If he could learn when to keep his mouth shut , thought Clearwater , and how to think ahead , he might could still turn out with some kind of maturity and style . From the trunk of the Ford , Clearwater retrieved eight license plates from eight different states ; his photo album ; a canvas bag containing a hunting jacket , two .38 pistols , masking tape , rope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a stash of jewelry and cash stored beneath false sides . He placed his things in the roomy Chrysler trunk , hid the license plates behind the trunk lining , and then waited until the boy put his things in next to the spare tire . Only then did Clearwater , with a handkerchief , clean the blood specks from his glasses . They drove both cars out of the woods and onto a two-lane blacktop . They were a few miles north of Albany , Georgia ; and the boy , driving the Ford , followed Clearwater for about fifty miles , until they stopped near a crossroads called Little Leaf at a used car lot lit with a string of white lightbulbs where they sold the Ford for two hundred and fifty dollars to a man wearing red suspenders who said business was slow . The boy said , " Well , the Lord always provides . " Clearwater had asked him not to talk . Before daybreak they stopped just outside Aiken , South Carolina , at a motor court that had a palm tree beside a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooster in the window of a music joint in Knoxville . After a day in Saluda and a day in Newberry they had stolen two expensive cars , sold them , rested a few days , and started out again . As they drove north of Chester , South Carolina-a cold sunset outside , the fine heater running inside-Clearwater admired the dashboard of the Chrysler . The car felt heavy . He liked the solid sound of the doors closing . He liked that it was black and shiny . He would keep it , and hide half his stash inside the door panels . And the radio had a good sound : powerful and solid . " Why do n't we just rob a store ? " asked the boy . " That 's not a good idea right now-or hardly ever . " " I know about being careful . I ai n't never been caught but oncet . " They passed houses whose interior lights , yellow through pulled shades or white through glass , were just corning on . " How many times you been caught ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught , but I 've been with people who were . " " When they got caught ? " " Right before . " " How 'd you get away ? " " I just did . " " How many people you shot ? " " Just that one . And you saw how it was self-defense . " Except the one before that , thought Clearwater , and the one before that and ... He wondered why his lips and then his chin always tingled when he shot somebody . Sometimes his chin went numb . He started changing stations on the radio to see if he could find a preacher preaching . It was Wednesday night , and he might pick up a prayer meeting somewhere . He liked to listen to the way some radio preachers got all worked up . He liked to hear all that passion up against a world that , he now knew , no kind of belief about God or Jesus could ever change one whistle . He had once believed , but all that was gone-like a precious child who died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stopped the dial on a station that was playing-by god , yes-Roy Acuff singing " The Great Speckled Bird . " He felt an ache in the hollow of his chest . " Do you know who that is , singing ? " he asked . " Nope . " They listened to the rest of the song . The boy was eating a banana . Clearwater had trouble with the way the boy would peel only an inch or so and nibble . And how could somebody with their head out their ass not know about Roy Acuff ? " Why do n't you just peel the whole thing and eat it ? " The boy tucked his chin and looked at Clearwater with shiny dark eyes from under his swing-bridge brow . " I eat it like I want to . I was taught not to touch the thing itself " " That 's Roy Acuff . We played music together . He used to love to fistnght . " Those days were before everything got washed away like a house on a mud slide . There had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , to make up for what had got taken away . The boy rolled down the window and threw out his banana peel . They were driving by a wide , bare field that seemed almost snow white in the cold gloom just before dark . The boy thought maybe he could feel Clearwater needing to talk but not being able to . He was that way every now and then , and the boy despised that kind of condition . " Did I tell you my daddy shot hisself " " No " Clearwater did n't believe him . " He could n't get help for his visions . He was bad to drink . My mama was in the garden picking tomatoes when he done it in the living room-with his feet propped up . " " That 's too bad . " " She had to be somewheres . " " I was talking about your daddy . " They slowed for a blinking red light . " So you ai n't even heard that car wreck song that Roy Acuff sings ? " asked Clearwater . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radios . Did you hear about that whole family that got shot after a car wreck ? " " I did . I knew that guy . " " The Misfit . Did they ever catch him ? " " Not that I 've heard . " " How 'd you know him ? I bet he was something . " " We worked together some , but he was too nervous for me . I wished I had his teeth . He had real fine teeth . " " I wished I had about anybody 's teeth . " After about a month , with the boy changing his name so much , Clearwater started calling him Preacher because the boy said that in order to really sell Bibles you had to know everything about Moses and Jesus and all them . Clearwater kept him on into summer because he had n't come across anybody any better , and he 'd learned to avoid him a good bit of the time , even while using him . Preacher liked his new name , and did n't seem to mind being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bibles here and there . They 'd worked up into Maryland and were working their way back south . They 'd been in the little crossroads town of Drain , North Carolina , for three days . It was hot and the town felt lazy . North of the railroad track that ran through town were big white houses with columns , maybe thirty or forty in all , and about three miles north a road conveniently doubled back so that they could first head north in case they were seen , then cut through and get back on Highway 301 headed south . During those first three days , Clearwater had checked several possibilities more lucrative than cars ; and after his investigations he 'd picked their mark-something different : a house where a doctor had his office and lived with his retarded son . A maid came in the daytime . It looked lucrative because the doctor did n't bank in Drain or up in Boltonville , and he did abortions . There had to be a well-stocked safe in his house . They separately checked into the Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the town limits sign . After driving through town and deciding on the Sir Walter , Clearwater had let Preacher-all dressed up and carrying his valise and suitcase-out of the car a ways from the lodge . As usual , Preacher was to avoid Clearwater until Clearwater gave the sign : two rocks on the back bumper of the Chrysler . That meant a meeting in Clearwater 's cottage just after dark . Preacher entered the Sir Walter about twenty minutes after Clearwater , signed in as Morris Poindexter , pulled a Coca-Cola up out of cold water in the drink box , and asked the desk clerk , a man with a sore on his mouth and pockmarks on his face , if a Bible was kept in the office for visitors . The man said , " You do n't see one , do you ? " " Well no , but with a Bible in sight , Christians like me would be happy about doing bidness here , and would spread the word . And I 'll be happy to sell you one-that 's my bidness-I carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message of eternal life between the covers . " " Me and my wife ca n't afford no Bible . We had to let go our desk clerk , and we got one colored woman to clean the cabins and she 's sementy-se 'm years old . Course , she can outwork both of us . " " Some thinks the Lord rewards hard work , " said Preacher , " but it do n't mean a whittle " less you been washed in the blood of the lamb . " The man said something and laughed . Preacher walked to the road after leaving his suitcase in his room . It was hot and humid even though the sun was behind dirty clouds . He set down his valise and was ready to thumb a ride when he saw across the road , about thirty yards down , a vegetable stand-under a funeral home tent with white-painted plywood boxes all around . The paint was thin enough to expose the plywood . A big handpainted sign read COLLARDS , TURNIPS , WATERMELON , ECT . From a distance he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of hanging scales . He picked up his valise and headed toward her . When he got close he saw she was a big , healthy , blond , curly-headed girl with a thin dress that seemed to show her skin beneath . Hair ringlets stuck wet to her forehead it was so hot . She was n't all that pretty right in the face , but there was something about her he liked-a kind of plumpness . He bought three peaches and introduced himself as Aaron Samuels . She said she was Marleen Dunlap , and he did n't talk long about Bibles before he realized that she was lonesome and not interested in the Bible at all ; so he loosened his tie and took off his coat and asked if he might sit for a short spell in the other chair-she said yes-and he told her a little about his heart condition and asked her if she might want to come over to his room that night and see his collection of exotic cards . She said she could n't do that , that she was bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the time until she was twenty-one in three months , but if he had time , would he come by the next day and she 'd show him a book from England that you could open and castles would pop up . He said he was n't sure how long he was going to be around , but he would like to spend a little time with her , so sure , he 'd make time . On that second day she showed him the book under the tent during a brief afternoon shower , and that night they met in the woods-she was afraid to come to the motor lodge-down a path behind the vegetable stand . She even brought along a blanket and rub-on mosquito repellent . He brought along a pocket flask of whiskey , a flashlight , and his cards , and it turned out that she was delicious , in some ways more so than he 'd hoped . She did n't protest about anything as long as he used a preventative , so after his joy making , he felt safe in baring his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Christian yet-in case she had that impression-but sold Bibles because it made him a good living , that he 'd already saved over nine hundred dollars in less than a year . He was interested in the business side of most anything , he said . He had gone to business school but had had to drop out because of his heart condition , which cured up on its own , and he did n't know if the cure had been a miracle or not . He was actually an agnostic , he said . And she told him that her mama and daddy had not gone to church since the church had brought them food one Christmas and made her daddy mad , but that she believed in God . She said they 'd been Reformed Presbyterians , and what was an agnostic ; and when he told her it was somebody who did n't know which way to lean , she said she guessed maybe she could be one of those , too . He then asked her to marry him and she said yes and he promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Carolina , as soon as his car got fixed up in Boltonville , and that they would come back and he would continue to sell Bibles in the surrounding area while they lived at home with her mama and daddy until they had children , and then he 'd give up traveling and they 'd move into a mobile home or , if he had the money , a small brick home . He said he really liked that brick pattern where there was a black brick along about every tenth red one . And he told her he wanted to get into some kind of business where he would n't have to mislead people about his own soul . He said he might like to sell cars . Preacher could n't believe his luck . She was a big happy girl , all sexed up , and she loved to giggle and rub his feet and did n't complain or ask any questions . It seemed like he was mighty lucky lately , especially if Clearwater would go ahead and get this big money job underway . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave Clearwater . He had thought working for Clearwater would be a big step up for him . But the man was always overplanning , and sad , and cleaning his fingernails with his little twoblade case . Preacher had seen a second set of keys to the Chrysler . After his cut from this one more job , he 'd make his move . On the afternoon of the third day the two rocks showed up on the Chrysler bumper . Preacher knocked on Clearwater 's door just after dark . Clearwater let him in . He looked around the room . There was a bed , table , two chairs , and a pitcher and a bowl of water-like his room , except the bedspread was green instead of brown . Clearwater 's canvas bag and other things were against a wall . On the table was an open road map , two hand-drawn maps , and a grocery sack with something in it . Clearwater had placed two pillows against the head of the bed ; he sat down with his back against them and stretched his legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do n't see that girl no more " he said . " That 's a stupid move-to get mixed up with somebody while you 're working . Wait until you 're on vacation . " " I got to have some regular life things . " " Not while you 're working for me , unless you want to work her into the planand there ai n't no room for her in the plan I 'm about to lay out . " Clearwater knew that something bad was going to have to happen to Preacher to get him over his connections to other people . " Have a seat . Beside the maps there " Preacher took a seat and looked for the second set of keys or where they might be kept . " What you looking for ? " " Nothing . Why ? What would I be looking for ? " " I do n't know . That 's why I asked . You get overeager . " " I just do n't want to be around here when people are supposed to start getting their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry about that . This job is going to be pretty good , I think . We 're going to get another car-the doctor owns a Cadillac-and a good deal of cash , the way I figure it . The first thing you need to do is memorize the escape routes and the side road turnoffs I got drawn on there-a copy for you and one for me . In case of a slipup . We can head south out of town and keep that way , or west then around to south , or north then south . There should n't be any problem ; but if we get split up , meet me Saturday at noon at the first gas station after the town limits sign down in Laurinburg . " Preacher looked on the big road map for an easterly route-or southeasterly . That 's what he 'd do . Route 421 . He looked at the coastline where 421 led to ; Carolina Beach . He could live there for a while , go swimming in the ocean . " What the hell are you looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm talking about the one I drawed . You just need what I drawed . We 'll do this gig tomorrow night or maybe the night after , as I see it . But first we got to go to a baseball game tomorrow and set it up . And we got to do some rehearsing " " Rehearsing what ? " " Get the clothes outen that bag . " Preacher went for the canvas bag . " No , not that bag . That 's my hunting stuff . The paper bag on the table there . " Clearwater had decided that during the opening of the safe , he would ask Preacher to stand guard outside . He would then hide a good deal of the money . Later , he 'd split a portion with Preacher , give him the Cadillac if the money was good enough , and say he was retiring . He needed to head to another part of the country , before his luck ran out-or maybe actually retire . The baseball team from Drain , the Drummers , was playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom about a mile outside the Drain town limits . Clearwater had learned that the doctor dropped off his son , Randy , at home ball games on Thursdays while he made house calls and that Randy always sat at the third base end of the second row in the old covered wooden grandstand behind home plate . Clearwater and Preacher entered the grandstand at ground level and spotted him . Nobody sat near him . His round face sat on wide shoulders , and his brown hair was cropped short . A crescent scar showed through the hair over his left ear . He wore overalls with Sunday school attendance medals and men 's service club buttons pinned to the front . He looked at the game through his brown eyes so big and lazy they reminded Preacher of a cow 's eyes . The two entered Randy 's row . Preacher , leading the way so he could sit beside Randy , had on a gray dress with little pink flowers , a black derby hat that did n't seem big enough , red lipstick , and a brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his lips were clamped together in a sort of silly grin . A few innings later , the doctor , a small man dressed in a white shirt and tie , stood at the grandstand entrance and motioned for his son to come with him . Clearwater felt confident that the doctor was surprised and happy to see that a man-from Summerlin probably-had chosen to have a young woman , apparently delayed in development , sit with his son . The doctor motioned for his son to come ; and Randy stood , looked down at Preacher , and reached his hand awkwardly toward him . He then slowly shuffled over to and down the center steps of the grandstand . A few people , over their shoulders , looked at Randy and then at the strangers , and then back to the game . Clearwater caught up with the doctor and Randy at the doctors car , introduced himself as Major Frank Arnold , just separated from the army because of kidney problems , and after a short friendly conversation explained quietly that the girl , Roberta Smith-his niece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cousin and needed an abortion , if at all possible , before they returned to Summerlin . The doctor told Major Arnold where he lived , and said to bring Roberta to his house that night at eleven . Preacher , dressed as the girl , was to be at Clearwaters cabin at ten-thirty with all his things packed and ready to go . When he got to his own room after the ball game , late in the afternoon , he did not sit tight as Clearwater had told him to do . Rather , he got out of the dress and wig , washed off the lipstick , put on his Bibleselling clothes , and started for the vegetable stand . She was sitting at her place , reading a book . " Whatcha reading , Sweetie-pie ? " he asked . He loosened his tie . " A paperback . " " I know that . What 's the name of it ? " " Blood at Stirrup Creek . It 's a Western . How come your lips are rosy ? " " I just ate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart . So they say . I keep a can around . " Clearwater , loading his canvas bag into the Chrysler , saw them . Preacher told Marleen about his supply of paperbacks up at his uncle 's in Virginia , where he was hitchhiking to that night to pick up his car that was finally fixed , and that he 'd be by tomorrow as soon as possible , probably before dinner , to pick her up so they could head out to get married and then go on their honeymoon to Silver Springs , Florida , He had sold his quota of Bibles and then some and did she reckon she might could come on over to his cabin after dark for a little roll in the hay before he headed out ? She could n't , she said . She had to sit with her grandma who had the blind staggers , but maybe they could find a place to pull off the road the next day . Preacher said for sure , and kissed her good-bye . As he walked away , he was wondering if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what that would be . Outside his cabin , he noticed that the door was open a few inches . He stopped , thinking about what all he had that could be taken . The door opened , and Clearwater stood with a red face thrust forward . " Why the hell ca n't you follow instructions ? " he said . " Why come you 're in my room ? " " Get the hell in here " Preacher stepped back , but Clearwater stepped forward and ushered him in-a fierce grip to the elbow-and once inside the door , turned him around and pushed him onto the bed , " Get dressed and stay in the goddamn room until it 's time to go . Like I told you . " " You should n't be pushing me around . You ai n't my daddy . " Preacher hoped they 'd get a lot of money-because he was moving on at his first chance . Wearing the dress , wig , hat , and lipstick , Preacher walked along the back alleyway toward the doctor 's house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . They 'd parked , as instructed , behind the church nearby . It was a hot night . Preacher felt sweat drops rolling down his underarms . Clearwater pushed open a tall metal gate , and beyond that , off to the side , stood a garage with a light over the door shining down on a cream-colored Cadillac that sat outside the garage . On the screened-in back porch Clearwater pushed a doorbell button ; from inside came a sound like a telephone ring . The door opened almost immediately . The doctor was dressed in a white jacket with a stethoscope in the front pocket and holding a cup of coffee that released a trace of steam . " Come in , Major . Roberta . Come right in . " " Doctor . How you doing ? " " Fine . Come right in . " " She do n't talk " said Clearwater , " but she 's got a real sweet disposition . I got some of her things here in the bag . She likes her teddy bears and a blanket . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor . They were in a large kitchen with counters and cabinets all the way around . They walked through a breakfast room , a sitting room , a living room , and then into a study with books lining the walls . There , on a coffee table in front of a couch , sat a beveled glass pitcher of ice water and two glasses . " Have a seat there on the couch and have a drink of water if you like . " The doctor sat in a big leather chair across from the couch . " I 'll explain the procedure . " The room looked like an expensive hotel lobby to Preacher . The couch seat was soft . He imagined a safe behind a picture somewhere , opening to stacks of green money . Clearwater leaned forward slowly , opened his canvas bag , pulled out his snubnosed .38 and pointed it at the doctor . " We won t be needing any abortion , doctor . But we do need to have your safe open , and we 'd like you to do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joke ? " asked the doctor . His face held a half smile , but also a look of new knowledge . " That 's for damn sure , " said Preacher . He took off his hat . " Man oh man . That 's for damn sure . " " Be quiet " said Clearwater . The doctor put his hand to his head . " You must be actors . " " We ai n't actors ; we 're bidnessmen " said Preacher . He wanted to get in a little humor . " Be quiet , " said Clearwater . A sound came from a door behind the couch . Clearwater looked quickly while holding the gun on the doctor . It was the son . He was dressed in blue pajamas and held a small teddy bear around the neck . He was trying to talk . Clearwater bolted up and moved to where he could see everybody at once . Preacher sat still , and then when he saw that Randy was coming for him , he stood , stepped over the coffee table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wig . " Look , " he said to Randy , " I ai n't a girl . " Randy kept coming , his big brown cow eyes open wide in surprise and delight . Clearwater moved again-to cover the doctor . Randy gripped a large quantity of cloth on the long sleeve of the dress . He was smiling and making grunting noises like a hog . " Sometimes he 's difficult " said the doctor . " Now 'd be a bad tune for that , " said Clearwater . He did n't want any more movement in the room . " Just stand there and be still , " he said to Preacher . " Let him hold your sleeve . Doctor , you need to open your safe . Right away . " " And ast him to turn me loose , " Preacher said to the doctor . " I said be quiet " hissed Clearwater . " Mr. Arnold , " said the doctor , still seated , " if that 's your name , I do n't have a safe " " You got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town or in Boltonville . " " I invest my money in stocks . My maid delivers all my cash to a financial advisor-every Friday . There is no safe . I can show you the paperwork , the stock market paperwork , over there in my top desk drawer . " He stood . " Sit back down ! And you , too , " he said to Preacher . " Sit on the damn couch . " He motioned with the gun . He felt truth in the room . It was seeping in like smoke . Preacher moved back around the coffee table with Randy attached to him and sat . Randy stood , holding the arm , which was raised as if Preacher had a question for a classroom teacher . " Let 's just leave , " said Preacher . " Shut up . " Clearwater walked to the desk drawer , opened it , and pulled out a handful of papers ; he looked at them as he held the gun on the doctor . Three to four hundred dollars deposited somewhere every week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name . He felt a tightening in his chest . " There is no safe " said the doctor , " and I 'm expecting another client shortly ? " Well , then you work too damn fast , do n't you ? " said Clearwater . This was falling apart . They needed to cut and run . " Where 's your cash on hand ? " " In the bottom left drawer there , in two envelopes , and you 're welcome to it . " " Go get the car , " Clearwater said to Preacher . " Maybe there 's some silver and some other stuff . " " Where 's the keys ? " said Preacher . He was seeing the ocean . He could head out on his own . Tonight . Now . " Under the floor mat . " With Randy attached , Preacher opened the back door to the warm night . They stepped onto the back porch , moved through the screen door , the gate , and down the dark alleyway . Only then did Preacher realize he 'd picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's feet dragged as he loped along . Preacher tried to jerk his arm away . He thought about dropping the canvas bag , but no , it was heavy-something important might be in there . Randy held on . " Damn you , turn loose , " said Preacher . Randy said , " Orrriff . " The Chrysler faced the rear of the church . He knew he had to leave quickly , even if it meant taking Randy a little way and then . . . He led Randy to the passenger side . " Get in , " he said . " I 'll drive . " Randy let him loose and got in the car . Preacher looked again down the dark alley and then out to the street . Hell , Clearwater would get the Cadillac and the silver and what not , all that . He got in behind the steering wheel , dropped the bag between him and Randy , found the keys , started the engine , and turned on the headlights , which lit the far wall of a Sunday school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a lot of red in it . He drove from behind the church , onto the street , and stopped in front of the doctor 's house . The engine was so quiet . Lights were lit behind drawn curtains . " OK , get out ! " he said to Randy . He motioned with his hand . Randy looked at him through his big cow eyes , made a sound , and slipped toward him . " Do n't touch me ! " He pushed the canvas bag toward Randy and felt something hard . He unzipped the bag and reached in . There was a jacket and , sure enough , a pistol . He could shoot Randy-in the foot , maybe , but down the road somewhere . No blood in the car . He slowly and quietly moved the car away from the curve . Damn , which way ? Where was his map ? The plan was to circle north and head south , but he needed to head southeast-on 421 . The doctor sat in his big seat in the study . Clearwater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keys to the Cadillac . The doctor pulled them from his pants pocket . " Toss them on the couch , " said Clearwater . He picked them up . " OK , stand up and walk in front of me . " His bag was gone . Preacher had taken the bag to the car . Damn . They could have put silver in it . They still could . They would leave the doctor and Randy tied up . He needed his bag . In the kitchen he opened a silver chest and stuffed his pockets and shirtfront with knives , forks , and spoons . They walked out onto the back porch-Clearwater behind the doctor . He looked for the Chrysler at the gate . He realized what had happened with the kind of delay one feels in seeing a tree fall far away and then hearing it . He strode quickly to the open gate and looked down to where the car had been parked , " That son of a bitch " The doctor called out , " Randy . Randy ? " " He stole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like icy winds . The doctor was talking . " Randy could n't steal- " " The goddamn Bible salesman , not Randy , stole my car-and everything in it . " " Randy ! " called the doctor , louder . Clearwater looked at the doctor , thought it through . " Come in the garage here with me , Doctor . I , I need you to show me where the light switch is . " His chin was beginning to tingle . The boy could n't remember how to get on Highway 421 , unless if he crossed the railroad track , followed it , and then once out of town turned back across the track . He had crossed the railroad track the second time and now saw a Resume Safe Speed sign . He pressed on the gas pedal . He reached into the bag . He 'd do what Clearwater was always talking about . He 'd think through and plan exactly the best way to get shed of Randy . Randy was looking out the window . He pulled up the hem of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pants , like in the cowboy movies . Tall pines lined each side of the highway as if leaning in from the top . He turned on the radio . Clearwater would come after him , but he 'd never guess southeast . He pressed the gas pedal , watched the needle move to sixty , turned the radio dial and stopped it when he heard a familiar sound . It was that great speckled bird song . " Do you know who that is ? " he asked Randy . Randy turned and looked at the Bible salesman . " That 's Roy Acuff . That 's " The Great Speckled Bird , ' " he said to the big eyes . They were in a curve to the right-drifting over the middle Une-when headlights appeared in their faces as if risen up from the ground . Preacher swerved right but could n't avoid the sideswipe , which ricocheted the Chrysler like a glancing billiard ball . He saw the ditch coming , and just before he stomped the brakes he heard a loud tree-automobile collision somewhere behind him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a loud scraping noise . He stood on the asphalt , his heart racing . He had to leave quickly . There was a bright moon lighting up the road in both directions . He opened the back door and grabbed his suitcase and valise . Randy 's door was against the ditch bank ; he was sliding across the front seat toward the steering wheel . Back down the road only one headlight was shining from the car that had hit the tree-shining upward at a sick angle like a spotlight . Smoke and dust drifted through the beam . He unbuttoned and stepped from the dress and threw it toward the ditch . Randy was out of the car and shuffling toward him . He jumped the ditch , just out of Randy 's reach and ran into the woods , stumbling , holding to his valise and suitcase , not feeling the briars through his pants . He fell , felt for the pistol , which was still there , got up and stumbled along in the moonlight until he burst into a field , his throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree line and up into a full bright moon that bore into him like a lone headlight in a tunnel . He found a tree , sat down , leaned his back against it , and looked up at a gray white cloud running along , lit from behind . He heard Randy coming . I 'll just sit still , he thought . This is the place to wait and let him go by me . He looked back toward the sounds . Where the hell did he get a flashlight ? he wondered . Was that Randy ? He moved to the side of the tree away from the flashlight , now shining here and there as if lighting up the entire woods . He pulled out the pistol , cocked the hammer , held it in his hand under his pants leg . The flashlight was beside him , then in front of him , shining in his eyes , right there in front of him so he could see nothing but the light . " You made a big mistake , boy , " said Clearwater . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back for you , " said the boy . He heard a pistol hammer click . " Wait ! Please . Just tell me about Roy Acuff . I just heard that song . Just tell me about what it was like . Tell me . Just sit on that stump and tell me . " Clearwater looked into the face shining up at him , the pale face and red-rimmed eyes , lipstick , the eyebrows coming together . Where was that stump ? The boy pulled the trigger , saw flashes from both pistols , heard two shots boom , felt a bullet slam into the tree beside his head-it was as if he 'd shot at himself . He fired three more times , then stood and fired again . The body lay still beside the lit flashlight . He looked backward , deep into himself , and could n't think of who he was .
