Many times m our lives we are asked to walk paths we find painful or pointless . But just as when Jesus asked his disciples to set out on their own , we find the answers lie further on up the road . // MOST DAYS , JESUS JUST WAS N'T THIS ORganized . Although there may have been a grand plan out there that he and his Father consulted during their daily communion in prayer , the blueprint was largely lost on the disciples . It seemed to them that they had been wandering randomly , preaching and teaching and healing in little towns all over the region . Nazareth . Capernaum . Nain . Bethsaida . Through a grain field , across a lake , into Gentile territory and back again . Up the mountain and down the mountain . Into town and out before there 's trouble . If they were making progress , they were n't sure how to measure it . If Jesus had a goal , it was Greek to them . And then came the day when Jesus told them plainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that city would begin at once . That 's when he got organized and appointed the 72 . How odd it was to have these others formally admitted into the ranks of the 12 . Up to now , if Jesus wanted for anything , he turned to the 12 and they got the job done . Most of the time , of course , it was n't anything more complicated than scouting out some lunch . But now he had multiplied their number by six and paired them off for a more expansive mission . " Go on your way , " Jesus told them . This might have been a little confusing . Normally , Jesus summoned people in the opposite direction : " Come follow me . " And he had taught them that he was the way . But now it seemed he wanted them to go another way , their way . Jesus had been their guide for so long now that to choose their own path seemed strange and a bit unsettling . Where exactly did Jesus expect them to go ? Maybe some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the teaching they were hearing from Jesus , asked indignantly , " Who can accept this ? " Certainly many could n't ; they went home and no longer counted themselves among his followers . At this point , Jesus turned to those who were left and asked , " Do you also want to leave ? " Peter spoke for them all when he squared his shoulders and replied , " To whom shall we go ? You have the words of eternal life . " THE TRUTH IS , THERE WERE DAYS WHEN THEY MIGHT HAVE liked to go home . It would have been nice to spend a few days with family and friends , boasting about their exploits and maybe exaggerating a bit their own roles in the miraculous events . But ultimately they knew they were doing the right thing sticking with Jesus . Like Peter said , he had the words of eternal life , not to mention the power to do miracles . The power , perhaps , to turn the world upside down and transform life in an occupied country into something worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan seemed less grand . Jesus was talking about a big harvest and a small labor force . He was asking them to go their way without money , supplies , or even shoes . All they had to offer was a boomerang sort of peace : if people were peaceful , they could keep it , but if they were n't , it would come right back . It was unusual for Jesus to be giving so many instructions . When they were simply following him , there was n't so much to remember . We 21st-century disciples sometimes make the same mistake these early followers of Jesus made . We think the instructions Jesus gave out are what are important to digest and remember . We forget the most important thing is to take the journey . As the saying on a hiker 's T-shirt reads , " The journey is the destination . " Getting there is mostly about ; going there . And if we do n't set out , we 'll never get anywhere . The rest of what Jesus has to say about journey is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff with you , and do n't rely on stuff to begin with . Possessions really get in the way when the way is full of grace . As Mother Teresa used to say , even God can not fill what is full . If we do n't take this journey with empty hands , we have no means to receive what God has to give us. all we really need to take along with us is the spirit of peace . If we come in peace , then our peace is not determined by what we find along the way . Journey is the avenue of movement , and Christianity is a religion in motion . We cant plop down on our virtue and call ourselves followers of Jesus . If Jesus is the one who 's leading , we have to admit that following largely involves keeping up . Jesus did n't hunker down in a synagogue and make a career out of it . he always knew there was someplace up the road to get to . And so when you meet vital disciples of Jesus today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always geographical , of course . Sometimes the place we need to get to is a state of mind or a condition of the heart . TAKE MAX , FOR EXAMPLE . HE WAS A FELLOW WHO MADE THE journey from addiction to freedom . His particular addiction was n't criminal . It was only cigarettes . But few in this country seriously doubt that cigarettes are n't harmful to the smoker and perhaps just as hazardous to those in the vicinity . And Max had a wife and kids . After a while the expense of his habit seemed like taking food right out of his children 's mouths . So one morning , Max got up , went to the bathroom and spat into the commode as he generally did upon rising . And it occurred to him that not everyone awakens to a rattling ball of phlegm lodged in his throat . He looked at his reflection in the mirror . It was his birthday . He was 40 years old . As he smeared shaving cream over his face , he addressed himself . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced , dragging the blade of the razor across his cheek . " I 'm not going to smoke today . " Just like that , the demon was stared down . Max did n't smoke that day or any day for more than a year . It was n't easy . He 'd been smoking for nearly three decades . But the farther he got away from his last cigarette , the better his food tasted , and the better he felt . He told the guys in the carpool they could n't smoke in his car anymore . he did n't want it to stink . All those years he had been smoking , it never occurred to him that he stunk in the same way . But casting out a demon does n't mean it is n't hanging around waiting to be invited back in . One day at an office party , Max looked around the room and saw all of his coworkers with a drink in one hand and a cigarette in the other . He tossed back his drink and started to feel a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarette . Without even thinking about it , he wandered over to a cigarette machine , dropped in his money and picked up the pack , which fell with that same old gratifying thud into the tray . , j When Max tells this story , you can still see the romance in his eyes . He entered into the mating ritual he 'd performed a million times before : first , tearing the smallest , neatest hole at the top of the pack with his thumbnail , just large enough to remove one cigarette . Then , tapping the cigarette once , twice , three times against the pack to tamp down the tobacco . He breathed a long breath of expectation : his first cigarette in all these months . He was so lightheaded at the idea that it was as if the nicotine were already swirling around in his brain . Just then , a lovely young woman wearing a snug little dress wandered up to him . " Could I have one of your cigarettes ? " she asked , giving him a fine red smile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmasked for what it was-a seduction . Desperately Max handed her the cigarette he had almost taken to his lips , and then crushed the rest of the pack into her other hand . " Here-take them all ! " he shouted . Relief at his rescue filled his lungs with a breath of fresh air that he has never relinquished in the 40 years since . This journey from addiction to freedom may seem short to someone who has never smoked . But ask anyone who 's ever tried to recover possession of his or her life what the length and difficulty of such a road can be . When it comes to self-control , the journey is made up of countless steps taken daily . Other journeys , like the one from hurt to healing , are equally common and just as demanding . Taking the journey is often hard . Most of us feel justified in where we 're at and who we 've become . We 're also strangely comfortable with our brokenness and ca n't imagine ourselves without it . If we go down that road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have to forgive ? Will we have to get well ? These can be scary ideas , and the longer we 've nurtured our troubles the more difficult it may be to let Jesus touch and transform us farther down the road . The early disciples might have felt the same way about taking a journey they did n't understand or fully believe in . But when they took the risk , they returned rejoicing : " Lord , even the demons are subject to us because of your name ! " May it be so with our demons , too .
