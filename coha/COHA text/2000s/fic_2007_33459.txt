Dianne Williams had the scenario all worked out . She 'd be pushing her grocery cart down the aisle of the local grocery store and gazing over the frozen-food section when a tall , dark , handsome man would casually stroll up to her and with a brilliant smile say , " Those low-cal dinners could n't possibly be for you . " She 'd turn to him and suddenly the air would fill with the sounds of a Rimsky-Korsakov symphony , or bells would chime gently in the distance -- Dianne did n't have that part completely figured out yet -- and in that instant she would know deep in her heart that this was the man she was meant to spend the rest of her life with . All right , Dianne was willing to admit , the scenario was childish and silly , the kind of fantasy only a teenage girl should dream up . But reentering the dating scene after umpteen years of married life created problems Dianne did n't even want to consider . Three years earlier , Dianne 's husband had left her and the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet young thing ) , promptly divorced Dianne and moved across the country . It hurt ; in fact , it hurt more than anything Dianne had ever known , but she was a survivor , and always had been . Perhaps that was the reason Jack did n't seem to suffer a single pang of guilt about abandoning her to raise Jason and Jill on her own . Her children , Dianne had discovered , were incredibly resilient.Within a year of their father 's departure , they were urging her to date . Their father did , they reminded Dianne with annoying frequency . And if it was n't her children pushing her toward establishing a new relationship , it was her own dear mother . When it came to locating Mr. Right for her divorced daughter , Martha Janes knew no equal . For several months , Dianne had been subjected to a long parade of single men . Their unmarried status , however , seemed their sole attribute . After dinner with the man who lost his toupee on a low-hanging chandelier , Dianne had insisted enough was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved to be easier said than done . Dianne had n't gone out once in six months . Now , within the next week , she needed a man . Not just any man , either . One who was tall , dark and handsome . It would be a nice bonus if he was exceptionally wealthy , too , but she did n't have time to be choosy . The Valentine 's dinner at the Port Blossom Community Center was Saturday night . This Saturday night . From the moment the notice was posted six weeks earlier , Jason and Jill had insisted she attend . Surely their mother could find a date given that much time ! And someone handsome to boot . It seemed a matter of family honor . Only now the dinner was only days away and Dianne was no closer to achieving her goal . " I 'm home , " Jason yelled as he walked into the house . The front door slammed in his wake , hard enough to shake the kitchen windows . He threw his books on the counter , moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upper half of his fourteen-year-old body inside . " Help yourself to a snack , " Dianne said , smiling and shaking her head . Jason reappeared with a chicken leg clenched between his teeth like a pirate 's cutlass . One hand was filled with a piece of leftover cherry pie while the other held a platter of cold fried chicken . " How was school ? " He shrugged , set down the pie and removed the chicken leg from his mouth . " Okay , I guess . " Dianne knew what was coming next . It was the same question he 'd asked her every afternoon since the notice about the dinner had been posted . " Do you have a date yet ? " He leaned against the counter as his steady gaze pierced her . Her son 's eyes could break through the firmest resolve , and cut through layers of deception . " No date , " she answered cheerfully . At least as cheerfully as she could under the circumstances . " The dinner 's this Saturday night . " As if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll find someone . " " Not just anyone , " Jason said emphatically , as though he were speaking to someone with impaired hearing . " He 's got to make an impression . Someone decent . " " I know , I know . " " Grandma said she could line you up with --  " " No , " Dianne interrupted . " I categorically refuse to go on any more of Grandma 's blind dates . " " But you do n't have the time to find your own now . It's --  " " I 'm working on it , " she insisted , although she knew she was n't working very hard . She was trying to find someone to accompany her to the dinner , only she 'd never dreamed it would be this difficult . Until the necessity of attending this affair had been forced upon her , Dianne had n't been aware of how limited her choices were . In the past couple of years , she 'd met few single men , apart from the ones her mother had thrown at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office where she was employed part-time as a bookkeeper . Neither , however , was anyone she 'd seriously consider dating . They were both too suave , too urbane -- too much like Jack . Besides , problems might arise if she were to mingle her social life with her business one . The front door opened and closed again , a little less noisily this time . " I 'm home ! " ten-year-old Jill announced from the entryway . She dropped her books on the f loor and marched toward the kitchen . Then she paused on the threshold and planted both hands on her hips as her eyes sought out her brother . " You better not have eaten all the leftover pie . I want some too , you know . " " Do n't grow warts worrying about it , " Jason said sarcastically . " There 's plenty . " Jill 's gaze swiveled from her brother to her mother . The level of severity did n't diminish one bit . Dianne met her daughter 's eye and mouthed the words along with her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered for Dianne . " No , she does n't . And she 's got five days to come up with a decent guy and all she says is that she 's working on it . " " Mom ... " Jill 's brown eyes filled with concern . " Children , please . " " Everyone in town 's going , " Jill claimed as if Dianne was n't already aware of that . " You 've got to be there , you 've just got to . I told all my friends you 're going . " More pressure ! That was the last thing Dianne needed . Nevertheless , she smiled serenely at her two children and assured them they did n't have a thing to worry about . An hour or so later , while she was making dinner , she could hear Jason and Jill 's voices in the living room . They were huddled together in front of the television , their heads close together . Plotting , it looked like , charting her barren love life . Doubtless deciding who their mother should take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Is something wrong ? " Dianne asked , standing in the doorway . It was unusual for them to watch television this time of day , but more unusual for them to be so chummy . The fact that they 'd turned on the TV to drown out their conversation had n't escaped her . They broke guiltily apart . " Wrong ? " Jason asked , recovering first . " I was just talking to Jill , is all . Do you need me to do something ? " That offer alone was enough evidence to convict them both . " Jill , would you set the table for me ? " she asked , her gaze lingering on her two children for another moment before she returned to the kitchen . Jason and Jill were up to something . Dianne could only guess what . No doubt the plot they were concocting included their grandmother . Sure enough , while Jill was setting the silverware on the kitchen table , Jason used the phone , stretching the cord as far as it would go and mumbling into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his conversation . Dianne 's suspicions were confirmed when her mother arrived shortly after dinner . And within minutes , Jason and Jill had deserted the kitchen , saying they had to get to their homework . Also highly suspicious behavior . " Do you want some tea , Mom ? " Dianne felt obliged to ask , dreading the coming conversation . It did n't take Sherlock Holmes to deduce that her children had called their grandmother hoping she 'd find a last-minute date for Dianne . " Do n't go to any trouble . " This was her mother 's standard reply . " It 's no trouble , " Dianne said . " Then make the tea . " Because of her evening aerobics class -- W.A.R. it was called , for Women After Results -- Dianne had changed and was prepared to make a hasty exit . While the water was heating , she took a white ceramic teapot from the cupboard . " Before you ask , and I know you will , " she said with strained patience , " I have n't got a date for the Valentine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Dianne had just announced something of profound importance . Martha was from the old school , and she took her time getting around to whatever was on her mind , usually preceding it with a long list of questions that hinted at the subject . Dianne loved her mother , but there was n't anyone on this earth who could drive her crazier . " You 've still got your figure , " Martha said , her expression serious . " That helps . " She stroked her chin a couple of times and nodded . " You 've got your father 's brown eyes , may he rest in peace , and your hair is nice and thick . You can thank your grandfather for that . He had hair so thick --  " " Ma , did I mention I have an aerobics class tonight ? " Her mother 's posture stiffened . " I do n't want to bother you . " " It 's just that I might have to leave before you say what you 're obviously planning to say , and I did n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her mother relaxed , but just a little . " Do n't worry . I 'll say what must be said and then you can leave . Your mother 's words are not as important as your exercise class . " An argument bubbled up like fizz from a can of soda , but Dianne successfully managed to swallow it . Showing any sign of weakness in front of her mother was a major tactical error . Dianne made the tea , then carried the pot over to the table and sat across from Martha .
