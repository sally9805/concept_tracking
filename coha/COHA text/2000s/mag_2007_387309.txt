. How to unwind , relax , and have fun with the ones you love most . There 's school , homework to be done , hair to be washed and braided , playdates to honor , birthday parties to attend . Ballet and gymnastics and track . Hardly a minute of my family 's time goes unscheduled , and when we do get a breather , we often spend it planning the next activities . Sympathetic to our plight  --  and the frantic look on my face when I saw her recently  --  my friend Val made a simple but revolutionary observation : " You need some family downtime . " At Val 's house , that means Saturday mornings , when she , her husband , and their three kids go without answering the phone and doorbell , and forsake all invitations , activities , chores , and sometimes even brushing their teeth , to sit around in their pajamas , reading , watching TV , or napping . " This , " she says , " is the way my family stays sane . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now carving out nonnegotiable blocks of uninterrupted , lazy bliss on Sundays , during which we spend the morning and early afternoon inhaling Nick 's cinnamon-honey waffles , thumbing through The New York Times ( we read the kid-friendly stories to the little ones ) , watching a favorite movie , and eventually pulling on clothes just clean enough to present ourselves for an early dinner at our local pizza buffet . No invitations or phone calls accepted . Just us having a good ol ' quiet , relaxing time . Together . Steal one ( or all ! ) of the following mom-approved approaches to getting an unpressured retreat your family will treasure . SHUT OUT THE WORLD Do n't bother inviting the Hunter family to a Friday-night event : Jessica , Scott , and their kids , Abby , 5 , and Sam , 4 , have another bash to attend : their Friday Night Party , during which they do marathons of activities at home  --  watching movies back-to-back , buckets of popcorn in hand ; playing kid-friendly board games ; having family slumber parties in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's inexpensive and they 're " focusing on each other and being happy , " says the Des Moines mom . This , she admits , is n't always an easy feat . " I do n't let myself relax when there 's work to be done , " she says . " It is sometimes hard for me when I get home on Friday and the house is a mess . But I force myself to stop obsessing and tell myself : " I am going to take care of this stuff tomorrow . Focus on Abby and Sam . ' ' " Putting the laundry off to party with your husband and kids can be well worth it . An easy dinner will be more than satisfying , especially if you serve it up as a picnic outside or on a sheet laid out on the family-room floor . One summer night the Hunters played flashlight hide-and-seek in the dark with their kids , then sat around talking about nothing in particular until bedtime . " It was perfect , " Hunter says . You can even take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Greg , who live in Brownsville , Pennsylvania , jot down ideas for activities they 'd like to do with their four kids and put them in a bin marked " Friday Box . " Then the kids take turns each week picking what the family will do over the weekend . They might go to a drive-in movie , play mini-golf , hit the local park to play baseball or the library for some new books to read to one another , or roast marshmallows in the fireplace . " We all look forward to that time together , " King says . Their family and friends all know about the ritual , and the only time it gets canceled is if there 's an emergency or the kids have had a " bad behavior week . " If you want to try this , let your child choose some activities so she feels that her ideas are represented . But be sure to include activities that appeal to you and your husband , too , and make it clear that no matter what 's picked , no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't chosen this week , it may be next week . MESS WITH MEALS Just as kids find comfort in routines , they also take special delight in seeing those routines turned on their heads . So one way to tug the family out of the humdrum together is to tweak something you do every day : eat . Try this some weekend night : Everybody gets to eat whatever he wants ( junk is totally allowed )  --  no questions asked . The only rule is that everyone has to pick from what 's already in the refrigerator ( or from takeout menus if the cupboard is bare ) ; that way , no one has to make grocery-store runs or pick up dinner . Relax  --  one night will be neither harmful nor habit-forming , just a much-needed cooking break for you and something memorable your family did together . Some easy ways to spin the everyday into a mini-event : * Eat a cozy dinner by candlelight . ( Soup and toast boosts the fun by keeping cooking minimal. ) * Hold a " kids cook " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whip up dinner while I serve as the " consultant . " Then I 'm their " assistant " when they 're measuring ingredients and sauting and plating dinner . An added benefit ? Since they picked it , Mari , 7 , and Lila , 4 , devour it . EXPAND YOUR HOBBY When I was little , latch hook rugs were all the rage , and my mother would sit for hours hooking little pieces of wool yarn into little holes . I wanted to do it ; she taught me how . Part of me thinks she had me join in because it kept me quiet and happy when she wanted to relax . Smart woman . But as a mom , I also now see the simple pleasure of sharing one of my passions with my kids . For my mother it was those rugs ; for me and my girls it 's cooking . Our tendency as parents is to send kids off to do their own thing when we 're busy with ours . But by co-opting their enthusiasm you can create family time out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kick out of , say , sewing a button onto a quilt square while you 're stitching your pieces together . Or teach him the difference between a perennial and a weed , and let him extract the impostors from your flower beds while you mulch . In the end , you 'll have all done something you enjoyed , and the end product  --  whether it 's a latch hook rug or a spectacular garden filled with your favorite flowers  --  will be a fitting tribute to your time together . JUST PLAY Bowling . Touch football . Soccer . Kickball . They 're all sports activities that little kids  --  and the kid in us  --  can have fun with starting at very young ages . You 'll get your hearts pumping , and collapsing together in exhaustion afterward can be a nice time for a quiet family chat ( or nap ! ) . The key : Keep it simple and laid-back . * Take the basketball out into the driveway and shoot into the garbage can . * See who can kick the soccer ball the farthest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . * Pick out targets around your yard or in the park and play Frisbee golf ( or just old tennis-ball golf ) , trying to hit trees or other stationary objects . * Fill your driveway with a huge chalk-drawn hopscotch board . ( Mari and Lila decorate ours with flowers and butterflies , and then laugh as Nick tosses his rock and feigns awkwardness as he bounces from box to box. ) * Square off in a snowball fight , or see who can make the most perfect snow angel ever . ( Decide from the window afterward while sipping hot chocolate . ) TAKE A HIKE There are so many beautiful things to see on the city streets  --  that 's what Walt and Brittni Greene , parents of Emmanuel , 3 , have found when they take their Sunday stroll through their New York City neighborhood . There are sidewalk vendors selling jewelry , clothing , books , and artwork , delicious smells wafting from the variety of restaurants , and finally there 's Emmanuel 's favorite  --  Riverside Park , where the Greenes walk along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and trees and flowers to one another . " If we did n't have this time each week , " says Walt , " we would just pass each other by and not appreciate the gifts we have in one another . " The same can be true even if you decide to hop in the car for a weekly drive , says Danielle Maguire , of Ault , Colorado . She and her husband , Kale , do so every Sunday with their 17-month-old son , Keoki , and drive along dirt roads to search for " neat-looking " barns , or comb the streets of nearby towns for the best-looking house or the funniest street name . One Sunday , they spent three hours wandering around looking for a particular park in their part of the state ; they never made it there , but they spent the whole time driving together " laughing hysterically and acting like children . " " For those three hours , I was stress-free and having fun with my family , " Danielle adds . " I came home renewed and refreshed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his crib , I thought to myself , " Now that was a good day . ' ' " BOX Your family does n't need a goal .
