Section : TALL SHIPS &; SALTY DOGS The dash and courage of Thomas Cochrane , the Napoleonic era 's nautical maverick , provides the spark behind the fictional Jack Aubrey <p> THOMAS COCHRANE had enjoyed a spectacular year , but now the jig was up  --  perhaps fatally An untested lieutenant when he was given command of his first ship  --  the tiny brig Speedy , the British Navy 's equivalent of a popgun  --  the rangy 25-year-old , fighting Napoleon and his allies in the Mediterranean , went on to startle his superiors by capturing enemy vessels , sometimes at the rate of one or two a week . Indeed , his entries in Speedy 's log for 1800 read like letters home from an action-packed , if potentially lethal , summer camp : <p> June 16 : Captured a tartan off Elba ... <p> June 22 : Chased a French privateer with a prize in tow ... <p> June 25 : ... kept up a running fight with gunboats till after midnight ... <p> July 27 : Fired several broadsides at one ofthree privateers and sunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1801 , when Speedy met El Gamo . Cochrane 's vessel carried 44 men and 14 guns , each firing a four-pound ball . Gamo , a powerful Spanish warship , had 319 men and 32 guns , most of them 12-pounders . The misnamed Speedy could never outrun Gamo , and it made no sense to resist . Checkmate . <p> Or maybe not . That morning , Cochrane would fight one of the most dramatic ship-to-ship actions in British naval history , launch his legend as an ingenious fighting captain , and  --  skipping forward nearly two centuries  --  become a model for the hero of Patrick O'Brian 's hugely successful series of novels about the British Royal Navy during the Napoleonic era . The novels are the basis of the new movie Master and Commander : The Far Side of the World , which stars Russell Crowe as the Cochranesque hero . <p> Quickly weighing his options , Cochrane sailed straight for the enemy When Gamo fired a warning shot , Cochrane raised an American flag  --  a typical ruse de guerre . Confused , Gamo momentarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alongside  --  the rigging of the two ships touched  --  aimed his guns upward and fired through Gamo 's hull and decks . As his opponent 's mammoth cannon , riding higher than Speedy 's deck , roared harmlessly overhead , Cochrane fired twice more before doing the unthinkable : handing Speedy 's tiller to his ship 's doctor , he boarded Gamo with most of his remaining men . The startled Spaniards , whose captain had been killed in the melee , surrendered . <p> Speedy 's victory was only one of a dozen or so outlandish episodes in Cochrane 's epic six-decade career  --  one that both inspired and rivaled the daring of O'Brian 's fictional hero , Capt . Jack Aubrey Cochrane , like Aubrey , was a tall , fair-haired adventurer , at war with both Napoleon and the hidebound British naval bureaucracy At sea , Cochrane , like his literary counterpart , was a peerless fighter , " one of the most brilliant of all frigate captains , with a marvelous combination of daring and judgment , " says N.A.M . Rodger , the noted naval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' A Naval History of Britain , 660-1649 . " He achieved extraordinary results with minimum casualties . His junior officers and men adored him , as well they might . " It was on land that Cochrane got into trouble . A political radical who eventually won election to Parliament , he was , in Rodger 's words , a " natural extremist " Who was n't above using his " political and social contacts to undermine his naval superiors . " Like Aubrey , Cochrane got caught up in a scandal , was sentenced to public humiliation in the pillory and , in the blackest moment of his life , was dismissed from the navy in 1814 . Two hundred years later , partisans on both sides still debate his guilt . <p> There 's little doubt that Cochrane , the son of a down-on-his-luck Scottish noble , had problems with authority  --  especially when it was illogical , corrupt , pettifogging or merely dull . ( Dean King , author of Patrick O'Brian : A Life Revealed , calls Cochrane " the John McEnroe of the Royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17 . As a lieutenant early in his career , harassed by a superior , he coolly invited the man to settle the matter " in another place "  --  which the other took as a challenge to a duel . Officially , that insubordination cost Cochrane a slap on the wrist ; unofficially , it gave him a reputation as a troublemaker . Things got worse when he bickered with Earl St. Vincent , First Lord of the Admiralty . Cochrane 's next assignment gave a clue to how much trouble he was in : despite his stunning defeat of Gamo , he was given an old hulk and told to protect the North Sea fishing fleet . The catch : there was no such fleet . Cochrane called the assignment " naval exile in a tub . " <p> Finally , in 1804 , Cochrane was given a real ship , the 667-ton frigate Pallas , and again he showed what he could do . In quick order , he captured three rich Spanish ships , snappily outsailed a French squadron that gave chase , and returned to Plymouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For an encore , he designed a fast-rowing galley and staged commando raids along France 's Atlantic coast . Napoleon , impressed , dubbed him le loup de mer  --  the sea wolf . The British Admiralty gave Cochrane an even bigger ship , the Imperieuse , and told him to do the same sort of thing , but even more of it , please , in the Mediterranean . <p> Confronted with Cochrane 's undeniable talent , the Admiralty in 1809 picked him to lead an attack against warships anchored in the French harbor of Aix Roads . Cochrane outfitted fire ships  --  hulks coated in tar and turpentine and designed to be set ablaze as the tide carried them toward enemy ships  --  and three " explosion vessels " packed with gunpowder ignited by a long fuse . Fire and explosions filled the night . At dawn , Cochrane saw a startling sight : seven French ships , stuck in the mud , helpless . All had cut their moorings to escape the conflagration . <p> Elated , Cochrane signaled to his own fleet  --  anchored several miles away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Gambier , did n't budge . Cochrane signaled again . Gambier acknowledged  --  and stayed put . Cochrane continued signaling , with little result . ( Gambier would later testify that " as the enemy was on shore , he did not think it necessary to run any unnecessary risk of the fleet , when the object of their destruction seemed to be already in hand . " ) Watching in exasperation as the rising tide began to free the French ships , Cochrane decided to force Gambier 's hand . Knowing that if he sailed in to attack , the admiral would order him to return , Cochrane instead allowed himself to slowly drift astern until he was within range and the enemy opened fire . Gambier had little choice but to send help . Four French ships were destroyed . <p> Back in England , the battle was celebrated as a glorious victory Cochrane thought otherwise and threatened to attack Gambier , publicly , in Parliament . Gambier , incensed , demanded a military trial to clear his name . The case was decided in his favor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outcome by , among other things , limiting the testimony of pro-Cochrane witnesses and even shipping one of them out of the country . <p> After the trial , the Admiralty loathed Cochrane . Elected to Parliament in 1807 , his radical politics made him enemies there as well . To this day ; the role his foes played in his downfall is hotly contested . What seems certain is that on February 21 , 1814 , a man knocked on Thomas Cochrane 's front door . According to the latter , the caller was a vague acquaintance . He asked for passage out of England on a ship ; Cochrane refused . When the man pleaded that he was being hounded by creditors and asked to borrow a change of clothes to disguise himself , Cochrane , taking pity , lent him an old coat and hat . End of story , according to Cochrane . <p> In truth , the man , named De Berenger , had perpetrated a massive fraud on the London stock exchange ; and , it quickly became clear , Cochrane 's uncle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never have participated in such a scheme . They lay the blame for his eventual conviction on charges of stock manipulation on the fact that his case was lumped in with the other defendants  --  who clearly were guilty  --  and enemies who sought his ruin . N.A.M . Rodger is more cautious : " The evidence was circumstantial but strong , " says the historian . " And he was desperate for money . " <p> The judge , who despised Cochrane 's politics , made it as difficult as possible for him to mount an effective defense . Found guilty , Cochrane was sentenced to a year in prison , a 1,000 fine and an hour on public display in the pillory . ( O'Brian 's hero suffers a similar fate when he becomes the unwitting patsy in a stock fraud . As Aubrey is placed in the pillory , hundreds of British sailors , gathered to offer support , doff their hats and cheer . It is the most moving moment in the 20-volume series . ) Although Cochrane , in the end , was spared the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verdict marked the nadir of his life . " When this allegation was , by political rancour and legal chicanery , consummated in an unmerited conviction and an outrageous sentence , " he wrote , " my heart for the first time sank within me , as conscious of a blow . " <p> Cochrane being Cochrane , the story did not end there . After his release , he railed against his persecutors , and acting on his liberal beliefs , went off to free the world . In 1818 , Chile hired Cochrane to run its navy ; in 1820 , he captured the Spanish stronghold of Valdivia , helping secure Chile 's independence from Spain . Over the next year , he did the same for Peru . Then he helped kick the Portuguese out of Brazil . In 1825 , Greece hired him to battle the Turks . But Cochrane despaired of the quality of his ships ' crews  --  " wild and fanatic savages , " he called them , " whose acts are guided by ... heedless avidity "  --  and he played no decisive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to England to find that the mill wheels of the gods were grinding slowly  --  but perceptibly-in his favor . Sympathizers gradually got their hands on levers of power ; some of his once-radical political ideas were now almost mainstream . In 1832 , after appeals to the king , he was granted a " free pardon " and appointed a rear admiral of the fleet . Fifteen years later he received the letter he had dreamed of for more than three decades . " I shall shortly have to name a commander-in-chief of the North American and West Indian Station , " the First Lord of the Admiralty wrote . " Will you accept the appointment ? " Cochrane said yes and , at age 72 , began a frustratingly peaceful three years in the Caribbean . <p> Cochrane died , at age 84 , in 1860 . He is buried in Westminster Abbey Sixty years before , in his first summer commanding the Speedy , he had met his idol , Lord Nelson .
