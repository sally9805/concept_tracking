The cop happened to look up at just the right instant or he would have missed it , not the actual impalement , but the fall itself . It took him a disorienting second to realize what he was seeing , the swelling black mass against the white stone and glass of the hotel facade , and then it was finished , with a sound that he knew he would carry to his grave . After that , he took a minute or so to sit on the bumper of his car with his head down low , so as not to pollute the crime scene with his own vomit , and then reported the event on his radio . He called it in as a 31 , which was the Miami PD code for a homicide , although it could have been an accident or a jumper . But it felt like a homicide , for reasons the cop could not then explain . While he waited for the sirens , he looked up at the row of balconies that made up the face of the Trianon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to go and check the guy out to make sure that he was actually dead , that perhaps the wrought iron fleur-de-lis spearheads protruding from the man 's neck , chest , and groin had missed all the vital organs in their paths . He was a dutiful officer , but this was his first fresh corpse , and he decided not to investigate more closely than a couple of yards , telling himself that it was better not to contaminate the crime scene . The corpse had been a good-looking guy , he thought , leather-darkskin but aquiline features : hooked nose , thin lips , a little spade beard . There was something foreign about the face , although the officer could not have said what it was . Turning away from it with some relief , he inspected the facade of the hotel , noting that there were three vertical columns of balconies adorning the twelve floors of the building , which was capped by a copper roof styled after a French chteau . That was the theme of the Trianon Hotel , as much French as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cornices , coats of arms , New Orleans-style wrought iron on the balconies , and , of course , fleurs-de-lis on the iron fence that surrounded the south face of the property . People were coming out of the hotel now , frightened men in the hotel 's white livery , a few guests from the lobby . A woman 's shriek recalled the cop to his duty , and he herded them all back into the cool interior . A broad man in a double-breasted cream suit accosted him at this point and announced himself as the manager . He knew who it was , a guest , 10 D , and gave a name . The cop wrote it down in his notebook . The manager departed , dabbing at his mouth with a handkerchief , and the cop resumed his study of the facade , although his eye kept drifting over to the victim . The flies arrived and got to their buzzing tasks , and shortly after that an ambulance pulled up . The paramedics emerged , took in the scene , declared the man officially dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their bus to wait in the cool of the AC . The crime scene van arrived , and the CSUs started to assemble their various implements of investigation and their cameras , while making some of the same cracks ( that 's what I call piercings ; sorry , he ca n't come to the phone right now ) that the paramedics had made , and after a little while an unmarked white Chevy pulled up , and out of it came a neatly built , caramel colored man , in a beautifully cut gray-green silk and linen suit . The cop sighed . Of course it had to be him . " Morales ? " asked the man . The cop nodded , and the man held out his hand to be shaken , saying , " Paz . " " Uh-huh , " said Morales . He knew who Jimmy Paz was , as did everyone on the Miami PD , as did everyone in Metropolitan Dade County who owned a television . Morales had not , however , met him professionally until now . Both men were first-generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like 98 percent of the Cuban migration to America , and Paz was not white , yet also undeniably Cuban . It was disconcerting , even without the tug of racism , which Morales was conscious of trying to resist . " You 're the first response on this ? " Paz was not looking at the corpse . He was looking at Morales , with a pleasant smile on his face and little lights glinting in his hazel eyes . He was looking at a man in his early twenties , with a fine-featured beardless face , in the complexion usually called olive , but which is more like parchment , a face that might be choirboy open when relaxed but was now guarded , tense , the intelligent dark eyes focused on the detective so hard they almost squinted . " No , I was here already . Somebody called in a disturbance at the hotel . It was a hoax call . I was just about to pull out when he came down . " " You saw him drop ? " " Yeah . " Paz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Morales had seen . It was perfectly clear from which balcony the victim had begun his fatal descent . All the balconies but one had their glass doors closed against the afternoon heat . In the single exception the door was open and the white curtains were flapping like flags . Paz counted silently . " It looks like the tenth floor , " he said . Now for the first time he inspected the corpse . " Nice shoes , " he said . " Lorenzo Banfi 's . Nice suit too . A dresser . Tell me , why did you call it in as a homicide ? " " He did n't yell on the way down , " said Morales , surprising himself with this statement . Paz grinned at him , a catlike grin , and Morales felt his own face breaking into a smile ... Continues ...
