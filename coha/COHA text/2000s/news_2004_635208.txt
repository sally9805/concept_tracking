<p> Even most casual golf fans know the Old Course at St. Andrews is the birthplace of <p> That title belongs to Prestwick Golf Club , which sits just south of Royal Troon , separated by only , of all things , a trailer park . In fact , the first 12 Opens were held at Prestwick , beginning in 1860 . <p> The club was formed in 1851 and hired Old Tom Morris as its first professional . He designed the original 12-hole course  --  some of which remains in play  --  and stayed at Prestwick until 1864 , when he was hired as the first pro at St. Andrews . <p> Prestwick is also where Young Tom Morris learned the game , and father and son combined to win eight of those first 12 Opens . The prize back then was a red leather belt , with the stipulation that anyone who won it three years in a row got to keep it forever . <p> Young Tom pulled off that feat in 1870 , and the Open was n't played the next year . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pooled funds for a new prize , a claret jug , and the tournament began again . <p> Young Tom won his fourth straight Open that year , before his tragic death at 24 , and the Open rotated among the three clubs until Muirfield joined the rotation in 1892 . <p> Prestwick 's current 18-hole routing debuted in 1882 , and the club hosted 24 Opens in all . Its last one was in 1925 , two years after Troon first played host and essentially replaced it in the rotation . <p> When PGA Tour player Billy Andrade played in the British Amateur at Prestwick in 1987 , he shot a 67 in the first round of stroke play . <p> When I finished the round , they were there to congratulate me for setting the course record , " Andrade told the Associated Press earlier this year . I said , Course record ? How could 67 be a course record ? ' And the guy said to me , Son , we have n't had a championship here since 1925 . " ' <p> Prestwick has remained an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lack of room for spectators  --  not to mention the legendary quirks of the 6,544-yard course  --  preclude it from ever hosting another Open . <p> The most famous hole is the first , Railway , " where the opening tee shot must find a narrow fairway , with a brick wall and the Glasgow-to-Ayr railroad running down the right side and dense gorse down the left . When our group played the course Wednesday , the invaluable caddies had us hit 5-irons to put the ball in play . <p> The first five and last five holes are full of blind shots and other oddities , bookending the more straightforward stretch of Nos. 6-13 , known as The Long Loop . " The fifth , for instance , called Himalayas , " is a completely blind par-3 where you aim for a pair of dots on the imposing hillside . <p> Similar is the par-4 17th , Alps , " which was the second hole in the original routing . It is believed to be the oldest unchanged hole in the world . Both the tee shot and approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a cavernous pot bunker protecting the front of the green . <p> This reporter took three shots to excavate himself from that bunker , but I did have a rare highlight two holes earlier . Appropriately called Narrows , " the 15th requires another blind tee shot to thread pot bunkers on the left and right . <p> A colleague who had played the course in a previous trip told me he wanted his ashes scattered on the 15th fairway because no one ever would step on them . But I managed to stripe a 2-iron over the left bunker and into the fairway , setting up a par . <p> It 's an interesting aspect of Scottish golf that private clubs such as Prestwick and Troon , though incredibly exclusive in terms of becoming a member , are accessible for public play . <p> The members have their fun , too , though . One annual event , known as Cross-Country , " has 24-man teams from both clubs playing the first eight holes at Prestwick , crossing through the trailer park and playing the back nine at Troon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resumes  --  with most of the members a little wobbly , one caddie reported  --  they play Troon 's front nine and the last 10 holes at Prestwick . <p> That 's 32 Opens and more than 200 years of history , all in one day . <p> Saturday 's third-round results // <p> Par 71 a-amateur <p> 205 ( -8 ) <p> Todd Hamilton 71-67-67 <p> 206 ( -7 ) <p> Ernie Els 69-69-68 <p> 207 ( -6 ) <p> Phil Mickelson 73-66-68 <p> Retief Goosen 69-70-68 <p> Thomas Levet 66-70-71 <p> 208 ( -5 ) <p> Barry Lane 69-68-71 <p> 209 ( -4 ) <p> Tiger Woods 70-71-68 <p> Scott Verplank 69-70-70 <p> 210 ( -3 ) <p> Colin Montgomerie 69-69-72 <p> Mike Weir 71-68-71 <p> Skip Kendall 69-66-75 <p> 211 ( -2 ) <p> Lee Westwood 72-71-68 <p> Nick Price 71-71-69 <p> K.J.
