Section : Innovation After a half-century of hostile borders and urban guerrilla warfare , Israel has emerged as the go-to country for antiterrorism technologies . Here 's the latest crop . <p> THE NAME IS BOND . YITZHAK BOND . <p> Israel , by necessity , has become the hotbed for counterterrorism research . Innovating well out of proportion to its size , Israel has spawned companies selling guns that shoot around corners , software that translates dog barks into English-language warnings and lasers that can detect explosives from 100 feet away . Working their way through labs now are intelligent robotic cameras , and nanolasers and nuclear resonance imagers to detect chemical and bioweapons . <p> " Much of the homeland security technology in the U.S. is 20 years old . It is unsuitable because the nature of the threat has changed , " says Dan Inbar , the Israeli founder of the Homeland Security Research Corp. , a Washington , D.C. consultancy . <p> Israeli exports of homeland security equipment will hit $300 million this year , up 22% per year since 2002 , estimates Inbar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is expected to grow from $46 billion to $178 billion by 2015 . ( The U.S. accounts for half . ) Terror Fighters Get Smarter <p> THE CORNER SHOT ( Price : $5,000 to $15,000 ) <p> Urban warfare means fighting in tight quarters , but a rifle-toting soldier ca n't shoot around walls , under cars or through an overhead window without sticking his head into harm 's way . Problem solved : Corner Shot , an attachment for automatic weapons , handguns and grenade launchers , swivels 63 degrees to each side of the barrel . Ammo is stored in the attachment . A video camera in the front sends an image of the target back to a monitor near the trigger . Unveiled by Corner Shot Holdings in 2003 , the device has been sold in more than 15 countries , including the U.S. <p> X-RAY VISION ( Price : still in testing . ) <p> Superman has it . Now humans can , too . Camero 's portable radar device uses ultrawideband radio frequency to penetrate almost any kind of wall and capture high-resolution , 3-D moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescuers and soldiers fearing an ambush have to drill holes and insert fiber-optic cameras or depend on fuzzy images from sonarlike sound amplifiers . The Camero device picks up reflected signals from as far away as 20 meters to produce images of the physical objects in the signals ' return path . Motorola is an investor . A prototype should be ready by next summer . <p> THE INVISIBLE FENCE <p> ( Price : $20,000 to $300,000 ) <p> Attendees at the 2004 Olympics in Athens were watched  --  and monitored  --  by cameras enhanced with artificial intelligence , made by Controp Precision Technologies . The cameras can distinguish humans from other moving objects and lock on their subjects , day or night . Guards will get an alert and can switch to manual mode and zoom in on the target . U.S. troops are using Controp cameras in Afghanistan . Just out is a 1.5-pound wireless version for mounting onto unmanned air vehicles and balloons during reconnaissance missions . <p> BOMB JAMMER ( Price : $1,500 and up ) <p> Like a Swiss Army knife of electronic warfare , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indoor cordless phones , cellular phones and satellite phones , as well as VHF , UHF and GPS signals , but leave the military radio spectrum alone . Can also be used to thwart bombs detonated remotely by seemingly dormant cell phones . Clients include NATO and the U.S. military . <p> FORGERY FINDER ( Price : $600 to $3,000 ) <p> The Smart Document Reader from I-SEC <p> Technologies claims a 97% accuracy rate at spotting forged passports and 90% for other ID cards . Documents are simultaneously scanned with visible , ultraviolet and infrared light to check for hidden watermarks . These high-res scans can be checked against official versions stored in a database to make sure things like expiration dates conform . In use in big airports in Europe , Africa and the Middle East . Successfully tested at the Newark , N.J. airport . <p> EXPLOSIVES DETECTORS ( Price : still in testing ) <p> The Sensobot from Laser Detect Systems Ltd. can detect and identify common explosives from 150 feet away by picking up the spectral fingerprint of bomb materials , even traces left on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . The Peroxide Explosive Tester , or PET , developed at Israel 's Technion Institute , is a $30 disposable device the size of a pen that detects bomb materials from the peroxide family , which are cheap to get and hard to spot . It releases a mixture of three chemicals that turn green when they encounter such improvised explosives . <p> LIAR DETECTOR ( PRICE : $200,000 ) <p> An airport security guard 's greatest fear is letting through terrorists smart enough to stay off the watch list . Suspect Detection Systems came up with a machine to smoke them out . A passenger puts his passport on a scanner and one hand on a sensor . The machine starts asking increasingly tough questions in the official language of the passport-issuing country . Artificial intelligence software monitors physiological responses through the sensor . Agents pull aside those who fail the test . The company claims a 96% accuracy rate after two years of testing . Slated to go into use next year in Israeli and U.S. airports , as well as Gaza Strip checkpoints . <p> DOG TRANSLATOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a collar or mounted on a wall , the Dog Bio Security System translates barking into alarms for police or military . Bio-Sense Technologies spent two years capturing the sound waves of woofs and arfs , encoding them to be read by a digital signal processor . All dogs emit the same type of bark when they sense trouble . The device can distinguish this bark from a dog 's " Hello . " A consumer version costs $100 . A high-end version costs tens of thousands of dollars but is still 25% the cost of video surveillance . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By Susan Karlin <p>
