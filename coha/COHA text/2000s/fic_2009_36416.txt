Present Day <br> November 19 , noon <br> the doorbell was ringing , and even though Michael heard it , he did not want to wake up ; the dream he was in was too comforting . Kristin was with him , and they were driving in his Jeep on a mountain road . She had her bare feet up on the dashboard , the radio was blasting , and she was laughing , her head held back , her blond hair blowing in the wind from the open window . <br> The doorbell rang again , a series of short bursts . Whoever it was was n't going away . <br> Michael lifted his head from the pillow  --  why was there an empty bag of Doritos next to his face ?  --  and glanced at the lighted numerals on the clock  --  11:59 . And then , even as he rubbed his eyes , it flicked over to noon . <br> The doorbell , again . <br> Michael threw the blanket back , dropped his feet onto the floor . " Yeah , yeah , hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathrobe off the back of the door and shuffled out of the bedroom . Through the opaque glass in the front door , he could see a shape  --  somebody in a hooded parka  --  standing on the stoop . Michael moved closer . <br> " I can see you , too , Michael . Now open the door  --  it 's freezing out here . " <br> It was Joe Gillespie , his editor at Eco-Travel Magazine . <br> Michael turned the bolt and opened the door . A cold rain spattered against his bare legs as his visitor hustled in . " Remind me to get a job on the Miami Herald next time , " Gillespie said , stamping his feet . <br> Michael picked a sodden copy of the Tacoma News Tribune from the stoop , then gazed off at the shrouded peaks of the Cascade range in the distance . That was why he 'd originally bought the house  --  for the view . Now it was just an awful reminder . He gave the paper a shake and closed the door . <br> Gillespie was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made  --  with water dripping from his parka . He brushed the hood back , and what was left of his hair fuzzed out around his head . <br> " You ever check your e-mails anymore ? " Gillespie asked . " Or maybe your answering machine ? " <br> " Not if I can help it . " <br> Gillespie blew out a frustrated sigh and looked around the messy living room . " Jesus , Michael , do you own stock in Domino 's ? You ought to . " <br> Michael did note a couple of pizza boxes , and some empty beer bottles , scattered around the coffee table and stone hearth . <br> " Get dressed , " Gillespie said . " We 're going to lunch . " <br> Michael , still barely conscious , just stood there with the wet paper in his hand . <br> " Come on , I 'm paying . " <br> Michael said , " Give me five , " tossed the paper to Gillespie , and went to get started . <br> " Take ten , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shower . " <br> Michael took him at his word . In the bathroom , he switched on the space heater  --  the house was always cold and drafty , and though he often swore to himself that one day he 'd do some insulating and basic maintenance , that day never came  --  and turned on the hot water . It would take a minute or two to get warm . The medicine chest above the sink was open , and half a dozen orange prescription bottles sat on the shelves . He grabbed the one on the bottom shelf  --  the latest antidepressant the therapist had prescribed  --  and downed a tablet with a handful of the now-tepid water . <br> Then , much as he dreaded the prospect , he closed the cabinet and looked at himself in the mirror . His shaggy black hair was even more unruly than ever this morning , curling off his head on one side and mashed down flat on the other . His dark eyes were red-rimmed and cloudy . He had n't shaved in a couple of days and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though he had just turned thirty , a couple of the chin whiskers were coming in gray . Time 's winged chariot . . . damn . He slapped a fresh blade into the razor and made a few hasty swipes at his stubble . <br> After a lukewarm shower , he put on some jeans , a denim work shirt , and the cleanest , driest pair of boots he could find by the front door . Gillespie was sprawled in his worn leather armchair , carefully peeling the pages of the newspaper away from each other . " I took the liberty of raising your blinds and letting in some light . You might try it sometime . " <br> They drove in Gillespie 's car  --  a Prius , of course  --  and went to the same diner they always did . Though there was n't much to recommend the place in the way of dTcor  --  vinyl booths , linoleum floor , and a pastry carousel with garish white lighting  --  Michael liked it at the Olympic . It was about as far from a chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could get , and it had the added virtue of serving breakfast all day . Michael ordered the lumberjack special , and Gillespie had a Greek salad with a side order of cottage cheese and a cup of herbal tea . <br> " Whoa , there , " Michael said . " Sure you 're not overdoing it ? " <br> Gillespie smiled while pouring half a packet of Equal into his tea . " What the hell  --  it 's on the expense account . " <br> " In that case , I 'm having dessert . " <br> " Good idea , " Gillespie said . " I dare you to order a slice of the lemon meringue . " <br> It was a running joke between them , that the lemon meringue pie on the top shelf of the carousel had not budged , much less been replaced , in the five years they 'd been coming here . <br> While they ate , Michael could n't help but notice that Gillespie had placed a FedEx envelope on the seat next to his thigh . Occasionally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure it was still there . Must be something important , Michael thought , and since it had n't been left in the locked car , it was probably something that was going to involve Michael somehow . <br> They talked about the magazine  --  a new photo editor had been hired , ad sales were up , the good-looking receptionist had quit  --  and the Seattle Mariners . Sometimes , Gillespie and Michael went to the games together at the Safeco Stadium . What they did n't talk about was Kristin  --  Michael knew that Gillespie was steering clear  --  and they did n't talk about the envelope either , until Michael , mopping up his egg yolks with the English muffin , finally broached the subject . <br> " Okay , I 'll bite , " he said , gesturing with the crust of the muffin . " The suspense is killing me . " <br> For a second , Gillespie pretended to be uncertain of what he was referring to . <br> " Is that the layout for my Yellowstone story ? " <br> Gillespie looked down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still trying to come to some decision . " No , the Yellowstone story ran last month . Looks like you 're not even reading the magazine anymore . " <br> Michael felt caught out  --  especially because it was true . For the past few months , he 'd hardly ever read his mail , checked his AOL account , called people back . Everybody understood why , but more and more he felt the world was losing patience . <br> " This is something I think you should see , " Gillespie said , sliding the envelope across the table . <br> Michael wiped his fingers on his napkin , then opened the packet and took out the papers inside . There were photos  --  some of them , in black and white , looked like satellite reconnaissance shots  --  and a sheaf of papers with the National Science Foundation name and logo on top . Many of them were datelined " Point AdTlie . " <br> " What 's Point AdTlie ? " <br> " It 's a research station , and pretty minimal at that . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <br> " Where is it ? " Michael asked , reaching for his coffee cup . <br> " The South Pole . Or at least as close to it as you can get . The AdTlie penguins migrate there . " <br> Michael 's coffee cup stopped in the air , and despite himself , he felt a quickening in his blood . <br> " It took me months to set this up , " Gillespie went on , " and get the necessary clearance . You have no idea the kind of paperwork and red tape you have to go through to get somebody onto the base down there . The NSF makes the CIA look friendly . But now we 've got it  --  permission to send one reporter to Point AdTlie , for a month . I 'm planning on getting an eight-to-ten-page spread out of it  --  four-color photos , maybe three or four thousand words of text , the whole enchilada . " <br> Michael sipped the coffee , just to give himself a second to think . <br> " I 'll save you the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're paying the usual rate per word , but I 'll bump you up on the photos . Plus , we 'll cover your expenses , within reason of course . " <br> Michael still did n't know what to say , or think . Too many things were tumbling around in his head . He had n't worked  --  he had n't even thought about working  --  since the Cascades disaster , and he was n't sure he was ready to take up his old life again . But another part of him was vaguely insulted . The project had been in the works for months , and Gillespie was only now mentioning it to him ? <br> " When do you need it by ? " he asked , just to buy some time again . <br> Gillespie sat back , looking just the littlest bit pleased , like a fisherman who 's felt a tug on the line . <br> " Well , there 's the catch . We 'd need you to leave on Friday . " <br> " This Friday ? " <br> " Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to fly to Chile  --  Santiago  --  then on to Puerto Williams . From there you 'll take a Coast Guard cutter as far as the ice allows , then they 'll chopper you in the rest of the way from there . It 's a very narrow window of opportunity , and the weather can close it at any time . Right now , it 's summer down south , so there should be days when it 's actually well above zero . " <br> Michael finally had to ask . " Why did n't you tell me sooner ? " <br> " I knew you were n't interested in working just now . " <br> " Who was ? " <br> " Who was what ? " <br> " Come on , Joe . If you 've been setting this up for months , you must have had somebody else lined up to do it . " <br> " Crabtree . He was going to do it . " <br> Crabtree again  --  the guy was always breathing down Michael 's neck , trying to snag his assignments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> Gillespie shrugged . " Root canal . " <br> " What ? " <br> " He 's got to have a root canal , and no one 's permitted to go down there unless they 've got a complete bill of health . Most of all , since there is n't any dentist on call , you 've got to have a note from your dentist saying everything 's in perfect working order . " <br> Michael could n't believe his ears . Crabtree had lost the assignment because he had a gum problem ? <br> " So , please , " Gillespie said , leaning forward , " tell me you do n't have any cavities and your fillings are all intact ? " <br> Michael instinctively ran his tongue around the interior of his mouth . " As far as I know . " <br> " Good . So , that just leaves the main question . What do you think , Michael ? Are you ready to get back in harness ? " <br> That was indeed the million-dollar question . If he 'd been asked last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't call again . But there was something stirring in him , something he could not deny  --  a flicker of that old excitement . All his life he 'd been the first one to accept any challenge , to climb the sheer cliff , to bungee jump from the top of the bridge , to dive for the bottom of the coral reef . And though he 'd tamped it down for months , that feeling was welling up in him again . He glanced at the satellite photo on top of the pile  --  from above , the base looked like a bunch of boxcars , scattered on an icy plain close to a rocky , barren shoreline . It was about as bleak a picture as could be , but it called to him as if it were a beach in Brazil . <br> Gillespie watched him closely , waiting . A wintry gust blew raindrops against the diner window . <br> Something started to turn in Michael 's mind . His fingers rested on the grainy photo . He could always say no . He could go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have another beer ? Beat up on himself some more ? Throw away some more of his own life , to make up for what had happened to Kristin ? ( Though how that would make up for anything , even he could not say . ) <br> Or , he could accept . He glanced at the next photo in the pile . This one , taken at ground level , showed a hut , raised on cinder blocks a few feet above the ice . A half dozen seals were lying around it like sunbathers . <br> " Do we have time for some pie first ? " Michael asked , and Gillespie , after smacking the table in triumph with the palm of his hand , signaled for the waitress . <br> " Lemon meringue , " he called , " all around ! " <br> Continues ...
