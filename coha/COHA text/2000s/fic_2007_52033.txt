Most of our readers probably know the name Ted Chiang already , but since this story is his first work of fiction to appear here , we should note that Mr. Chiang is the author of such stones as " Division by Zero , " " Hell Is the Absence of God , " and " Tower of Babylon " ; his short fiction has been collected in Stories of Your Life and Others . His new story - which is going to be published shortly by Subterranean Press in a hardcover chapbook - concerns a Baghdad merchant . Mr. Chiang says the story was inspired in part by the work of physicist Kip Thorne . <p> MIGHTY CALIPH AND Commander of the Faithful , I am humbled to be in the splendor of your presence ; a man can hope for no greater blessing as long as he lives . The story I have to tell is truly a strange one , and were the entirety to be tattooed at the corner of one 's eye , the marvel of its presentation would not exceed that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who would be warned and a lesson to those who would learn . My name is Fuwaad ibn Abbas , and I was born here in Baghdad , City of Peace . My father was a grain merchant , but for much of my life I have worked as a purveyor of fine fabrics , trading in silk from Damascus and linen from Egypt and scarves from Morocco that are embroidered with gold . I was prosperous , but my heart was troubled , and neither the purchase of luxuries nor the giving of alms was able to soothe it . Now I stand before you without a single dirham in my purse , but I am at peace . Allah is the beginning of all things , but with Your Majesty 's permission , I begin my story with the day I took a walk through the district of metalsmiths . I needed to purchase a gift for a man I had to do business with , and had been told he might appreciate a tray made of silver . After browsing for half an hour , I noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been taken over by a new merchant . It was a prized location that must have been expensive to acquire , so I entered to peruse its wares . Never before had I seen such a marvelous assortment of goods . Near the entrance there was an astrolabe equipped with seven plates inlaid with silver , a water-clock that chimed on the hour , and a nightingale made of brass that sang when the wind blew . Farther inside there were even more ingenious mechanisms , and I stared at them the way a child watches a juggler , when an old man stepped out from a doorway in the back . " Welcome to my humble shop , my lord , " he said . " My name is Bashaarat . How may I assist you ? " " These are remarkable items that you have for sale . I deal with traders from every corner of the world , and yet I have never seen their like . From where , may I ask , did you acquire your merchandise ? " " I am grateful to you for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see here was made in my workshop , by myself or by my assistants under my direction . " I was impressed that this man could be so well versed in so many arts . I asked him about the various instruments in his shop , and listened to him discourse learnedly about astrology , mathematics , geomancy , and medicine . We spoke for over an hour , and my fascination and respect bloomed like a flower warmed by the dawn , until he mentioned his experiments in alchemy . " Alchemy ? " I said . This surprised me , for he did not seem the type to make such a sharper 's claim . " You mean you can turn base metal into gold ? " " I can , my lord , but that is not in fact what most seek from alchemy . " " What do most seek , then ? " " They seek a source of gold that is cheaper than mining ore from the ground . Alchemy does describe a means to make gold , but the procedure is so arduous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as easy as plucking peaches from a tree . " I smiled . " A clever reply . No one could dispute that you are a learned man , but I know better than to credit alchemy . " Bashaarat looked at me and considered . " I have recently built something that may change your opinion . You would be the first person I have shown it to . Would you care to see it ? " " It would be a great pleasure . " " Please follow me . " He led me through the doorway in the rear of his shop . The next room was a workshop , arrayed with devices whose functions I could not guess - bars of metal wrapped with enough copper thread to reach the horizon , mirrors mounted on a circular slab of granite floating in quicksilver - but Bashaarat walked past these without a glance . Instead he led me to a sturdy pedestal , chest high , on which a stout metal hoop was mounted upright . The hoop 's opening was as wide as two outstretched hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongest man to carry . The metal was black as night , but polished to such smoothness that , had it been a different color , it could have served as a mirror . Bashaarat bade me stand so that I looked upon the hoop edgewise , while he stood next to its opening . " Please observe , " he said . Bashaarat thrust his arm through the hoop from the right side , but it did not extend out from the left . Instead , it was as if his arm were severed at the elbow , and he waved the stump up and down , and then pulled his arm out intact . I had not expected to see such a learned man perform a conjuror 's trick , but it was well done , and I applauded politely . " Now wait a moment , " he said as he took a step back . I waited , and behold , an arm reached out of the hoop from its left side , without a body to hold it up . The sleeve it wore matched Bashaarat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then retreated through the hoop until it was gone . The first trick I had thought a clever mime , but this one seemed far superior , because the pedestal and hoop were clearly too slender to conceal a person . " Very clever ! " I exclaimed . " Thank you , but this is not mere sleight of hand . The right side of the hoop precedes the left by several seconds . To pass through the hoop is to cross that duration instantly . " " I do not understand , " I said . " Let me repeat the demonstration . " Again he thrust his arm through the hoop , and his arm disappeared . He smiled , and pulled back and forth as if playing tug-a-rope . Then he pulled his arm out again , and presented his hand to me with the palm open . On it lay a ring I recognized . " That is my ring ! " I checked my hand , and saw that my ring still lay on my finger . " You have conjured up a duplicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wait . " Again , an arm reached out from the left side . Wishing to discover the mechanism of the trick , I rushed over to grab it by the hand . It was not a false hand , but one fully warm and alive as mine . I pulled on it , and it pulled back . Then , as deft as a pickpocket , the hand slipped the ring from my finger and the arm withdrew into the hoop , vanishing completely . " My ring is gone ! " I exclaimed . " No , my lord , " he said . " Your ring is here . " And he gave me the ring he held . " Forgive me for my game . " I replaced it on my finger . " You had the ring before it was taken from me . " At that moment an arm reached out , this time from the right side of the hoop . " What is this ? " I exclaimed . Again I recognized it as his by the sleeve before it withdrew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Recall , " he said , " the right side of the hoop precedes the left . " And he walked over to the left side of the hoop , and thrust his arm through from that side , and again it disappeared . Your Majesty has undoubtedly already grasped this , but it was only then that I understood : whatever happened on the right side of the hoop was complemented , a few seconds later , by an event on the left side . " Is this sorcery ? " I asked . " No , my lord , I have never met a djinni , and if I did , I would not trust it to do my bidding . This is a form of alchemy . " He offered an explanation , speaking of his search for tiny pores in the skin of reality , like the holes that worms bore into wood , and how upon finding one he was able to expand and stretch it the way a glassblower turns a dollop of molten glass into a long-necked pipe , and how he then allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to thicken like syrup at the other . I confess I did not really understand his words , and can not testify to their truth . All I could say in response was , " You have created something truly astonishing . " " Thank you , " he said , " but this is merely a prelude to what I intended to show you . " He bade me follow him into another room , farther in the back . There stood a circular doorway whose massive frame was made of the same polished black metal , mounted in the middle of the room . " What I showed you before was a Gate of seconds , " he said . " This is a Gate of Years . The two sides of the doorway are separated by a span of twenty years . " I confess I did not understand his remark immediately . I imagined him reaching his arm in from the right side and waiting twenty years before it emerged from the left side , and it seemed a very obscure magic trick . I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one use for it , " he said , " but consider what would happen if you were to step through . " Standing on the right side , he gestured for me to come closer , and then pointed through the doorway . " Look . " I looked , and saw that there appeared to be different rugs and pillows on the other side of the room than I had seen when I had entered . I moved my head from side to side , and realized that when I peered through the doorway , I was looking at a different room from the one I stood in . " You are seeing the room twenty years from now , " said Bashaarat . I blinked , as one might at an illusion of water in the desert , but what I saw did not change . " And you say I could step through ? " I asked . " You could . And with that step , you would visit the Baghdad of twenty years hence . You could seek out your older self and have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the Gate of Years and return to the present day . " Hearing Bashaarat 's words , I felt as if I were reeling . " You have done this ? " I asked him . " You have stepped through ? " " I have , and so have numerous customers of mine . " " Earlier you said I was the first to whom you showed this . " " This Gate , yes . But for many years I owned a shop in Cairo , and it was there that I first built a Gate of Years . There were many to whom I showed that Gate , and who made use of it . " " What did they learn when talking to their older selves ? " " Each person learns something different . If you wish , I can tell you the story of one such person . " Bashaarat proceeded to tell me such a story , and if it pleases Your Majesty , I will recount it here . THE TALE OF THE FORTUNATE ROPE-MAKER THERE ONCE WAS a young man named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the Gate of Years to see the Cairo of twenty years later , and upon arriving he marveled at how the city had grown . He felt as if he had stepped into a scene embroidered on a tapestry , and even though the city was no more and no less than Cairo , he looked upon the most common sights as objects of wonder . He was wandering by the Zuweyla Gate , where the sword dancers and snake charmers perform , when an astrologer called to him . " Young man ! Do you wish to know the future ? " Hassan laughed . " I know it already , " he said . " Surely you want to know if wealth awaits you , do you not ? " " I am a rope-maker . I know that it does not . " " Can you be so sure ? What about the renowned merchant Hassan alHubbaul , who began as a rope-maker ? " His curiosity aroused , Hassan asked around the market for others who knew of this wealthy merchant , and found that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wealthy Habbaniya quarter of the city , so Hassan walked there and asked people to point out his house , which turned out to be the largest one on its street . He knocked at the door , and a servant led him to a spacious and wellappointed hall with a fountain in the center . Hassan waited while the servant went to fetch his master , but as he looked at the polished ebony and marble around him , he felt that he did not belong in such surroundings , and was about to leave when his older self appeared . " At last you are here ! " the man said . " I have been expecting you ! " " You have ? " said Hassan , astounded . " Of course , because I visited my older self just as you are visiting me . It has been so long that I had forgotten the exact day . Come , dine with me . " The two went to a dining room , where servants brought chicken stuffed with pistachio nuts , fritters soaked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older Hassan gave few details of his life : he mentioned business interests of many varieties , but did not say how he had become a merchant ; he mentioned a wife , but said it was not time for the younger man to meet her . Instead , he asked young Hassan to remind him of the pranks he had played as a child , and he laughed to hear stories that had faded from his own memory . At last the younger Hassan asked the older , " How did you make such great changes in your fortune ? " " All I will tell you right now is this : when you go to buy hemp from the market , and you are walking along the Street of Black Dogs , do not walk along the south side as you usually do . Walk along the north . " " And that will enable me to raise my station ? " " Just do as I say . Go back home now ; you have rope to make . You will know when to visit me again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was instructed , keeping to the north side of the street even when there was no shade there . It was a few days later that he witnessed a maddened horse run amok on the south side of the street directly opposite him , kicking several people , injuring another by knocking a heavy jug of palm oil onto him , and even trampling one person under its hooves . After the commotion had subsided , Hassan prayed to Allah for the injured to be healed and the dead to be at peace , and thanked Allah for sparing him . The next day Hassan stepped through the Gate of Years and sought out his older self . " Were you injured by the horse when you walked by ? " he asked him . " No , because I heeded my older self 's warning . Do not forget , you and I are one , - every circumstance that befalls you once befell me . " And so the elder Hassan gave the younger instructions , and the younger obeyed them . He refrained from buying eggs from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck customers who bought eggs from a spoiled basket . He bought extra hemp , and thus had material to work with when others suffered a shortage due to a delayed caravan . Following his older self 's instructions spared Hassan many troubles , but he wondered why his older self would not tell him more . Who would he marry ? How would he become wealthy ? Then one day , after having sold all his rope in the market and carrying an unusually full purse , Hassan bumped into a boy while walking on the street . He felt for his purse , discovered it missing , and turned around with a shout to search the crowd for the pickpocket . Hearing Hassan 's cry , the boy immediately began running through the crowd . Hassan saw that the boy 's tunic was torn at the elbow , but then quickly lost sight of him . For a moment Hassan was shocked that this could happen with no warning from his older self . But his surprise was soon replaced by anger , and he gave chase . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " tunics , until by chance he found the pickpocket crouching beneath a fruit wagon . Hassan grabbed him and began shouting to all that he had caught a thief , asking them to find a guardsman . The boy , afraid of arrest , dropped Hassan 's purse and began weeping . Hassan stared at the boy for a long moment , and then his anger faded , and he let him go . When next he saw his older self , Hassan asked him , " Why did you not warn me about the pickpocket ? " " Did you not enjoy the experience ? " asked his older self . Hassan was about to deny it , but stopped himself . " I did enjoy it , " he admitted . In pursuing the boy , with no hint of whether he 'd succeed or fail , he had felt his blood surge in a way it had not for many weeks . And seeing the boy 's tears had reminded him of the Prophet 's teachings on the value of mercy , and Hassan had felt virtuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you rather I had denied you that , then ? " Just as we grow to understand the purpose of customs that seemed pointless to us in our youth , Hassan realized that there was merit in withholding information as well as in disclosing it . " No , " he said , " it was good that you did not warn me . " The older Hassan saw that he had understood . " Now I will tell you something very important . Hire a horse . I will give you directions to a spot in the foothills to the west of the city . There you will find within a grove of trees one that was struck by lightning . Around the base of the tree , look for the heaviest rock you can overturn , and then dig beneath it . " " What should I look for ? " " You will know when you find it . " The next day Hassan rode out to the foothills and searched until he found the tree . The ground around it was covered in rocks , so Hassan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then another . At last his spade struck something besides rock and soil . He cleared aside the soil and discovered a bronze chest , filled with gold dinars and assorted jewelry . Hassan had never seen its like in all his life . He loaded the chest onto the horse , and rode back to Cairo . The next time he spoke to his older self , he asked , " How did you know where the treasure was ? " " I learned it from myself , " said the older Hassan , " just as you did . As to how we came to know its location , I have no explanation except that it was the will of Allah , and what other explanation is there for anything ? " " I swear I shall make good use of these riches that Allah has blessed me with , " said the younger Hassan . " And I renew that oath , " said the older . " This is the last time we shall speak . You will find your own way now . Peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With the gold he was able to purchase hemp in great quantity , and hire workmen and pay them a fair wage , and sell rope profitably to all who sought it . He married a beautiful and clever woman , at whose advice he began trading in other goods , until he was a wealthy and respected merchant . All the while he gave generously to the poor and lived as an upright man . In this way Hassan lived the happiest of lives until he was overtaken by death , breaker of ties and destroyer of delights . " That is a remarkable story , " I said . " For someone who is debating whether to make use of the Gate , there could hardly be a better inducement . " " You are wise to be skeptical , " said Bashaarat . " Allah rewards those he wishes to reward and chastises those he wishes to chastise . The Gate does not change how he regards you . " I nodded , thinking I understood . " So even if you succeed in avoiding the misfortunes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will not encounter other misfortunes . " " No , forgive an old man for being unclear . Using the Gate is not like drawing lots , where the token you select varies with each turn . Rather , using the Gate is like taking a secret passageway in a palace , one that lets you enter a room more quickly than by walking down the hallway . The room remains the same , no matter which door you use to enter . " This surprised me . " The future is fixed , then ? As unchangeable as the past ? " " It is said that repentance and atonement erase the past . " " I have heard that too , but I have not found it to he true . " " I am sorry to hear that , " said Bashaarat . " All I can say is that the future is no different . " I thought on this for a while . " So if you learn that you are dead twenty years from now , there is nothing you can do to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me very disheartening , but then I wondered if it could not also provide a guarantee . I said , " Suppose you learn that you are alive twenty years from now . Then nothing could kill you in the next twenty years . You could then fight in battles without a care , because your survival is assured . " " That is possible , " he said . " It is also possible that a man who would make use of such a guarantee would not find his older self alive when he first used the Gate . " " Ah , " I said . " Is it then the case that only the prudent meet their older selves ? " " Let me tell you the story of another person who used the Gate , and you can decide for yourself if he was prudent or not . " Bashaarat proceeded to tell me the story , and if it pleases Your Majesty , I will recount it here . THE TALE OF THE WEAVER WHO STOLE FROM HIMSELF THERE WAS a young weaver named Ajib who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but yearned to taste the luxuries enjoyed by the wealthy . After hearing the story of Hassan , Ajib immediately stepped through the Gate of Years to seek out his older self , who , he was sure , would be as rich and as generous as the older Hassan . Upon arriving in the Cairo of twenty years later , he proceeded to the wealthy Habbaniya quarter of the city and asked people for the residence of Ajib ibn Taher . He was prepared , if he met someone who knew the man and remarked on the similarity of their features , to identify himself as Ajib 's son , newly arrived from Damascus . But he never had the chance to offer this story , because no one he asked recognized the name . Eventually he decided to return to his old neighborhood , and see if anyone there knew where he had moved to . When he got to his old street , he stopped a boy and asked him if he knew where to find a man named Ajib . The boy , directed him to Ajib @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live , " Ajib said . " Where does he live now ? " " If he has moved since yesterday , I do not know where , " said the boy . Ajib was incredulous . Could his older self still live in the same house , twenty years later ? That would mean he had never become wealthy , and his older self would have no advice to give him , or at least none Ajib would profit by following . How could his fate differ so much from that of the fortunate rope-maker ? In hopes that the boy was mistaken , Ajib waited outside the house , and watched . Eventually he saw a man leave the house , and with a sinking heart recognized it as his older self . The older Ajib was followed by a woman that he presumed was his wife , but he scarcely noticed her , for all he could see was his own failure to have bettered himself . He stared with dismay at the plain clothes the older couple wore until they walked out of sight . Driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads of the executed , Ajib went to the door of his house . His own key still fit the lock , so he entered . The furnishings had changed , but were simple and worn , and Ajib was mortified to see them . After twenty years , could he not even afford better pillows ? On an impulse , he went to the wooden chest where he normally kept his savings , and unlocked it . He lifted the lid , and saw the chest was filled with gold dinars . Ajib was astonished . His older self had a chest of gold , and yet he wore such plain clothes and lived in the same small house for twenty years ! What a stingy , joyless man his older self must be , thought Ajib , to have wealth and not enjoy it . Ajib had long known that one could not take one 's possessions to the grave . Could that be something that he would forget as he aged ? Ajib decided that such riches should belong to someone who appreciated them , and that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be stealing , he reasoned , because it was he himself who would receive it . He heaved the chest onto his shoulder , and with much effort was able to bring it back through the Gate of Years to the Cairo he knew . He deposited some of his new found wealth with a banker , but always carried a purse heavy with gold . He dressed in a Damascene robe and Cordovan slippers and a Khurasani turban bearing a jewel . He rented a house in the wealthy quarter , furnished it with the finest rugs and couches , and hired a cook to prepare him sumptuous meals . He then sought out the brother of a woman he had long desired from afar , a woman named Taahira . Her brother was an apothecary , and Taahira assisted him in his shop . Ajib would occasionally purchase a remedy so that he might speak to her . Once he had seen her veil slip , and her eyes were as dark and beautiful as a gazelle 's . Taahira 's brother would not have consented to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a favorable match . Taahira 's brother approved , and Taahira herself readily consented , for she had desired Ajib , too . Ajib spared no expense for their wedding . He hired one of the pleasure barges that floated in the canal south of the city and held a feast with musicians and dancers , at which he presented her with a magnificent pearl necklace . The celebration was the subject of gossip throughout the quarter . Ajib reveled in the joy that money brought him and Taahira , and for a week the two of them lived the most delightful of lives . Then one day Ajib came home to find the door to his house broken open and the interior ransacked of all silver and gold items . The terrified cook emerged from hiding and told him that robbers had taken Taahira . Ajib prayed to Allah until , exhausted with worry , he fell asleep . The next morning he was awoken by a knocking at his door . There was a stranger there . " I have a message for you , " the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Your wife is safe . " Ajib felt fear and rage churn in his stomach like black bile . " What ransom would you have ? " he asked . " Ten thousand dinars . " " That is more than all I possess ! " Ajib exclaimed . " Do not haggle with me , " said the robber . " I have seen you spend money like others pour water . " Ajib dropped to his knees . " I have been wasteful . I swear by the name of the Prophet that I do not have that much , " he said . The robber looked at him closely . " Gather all the money you have , " he said , " and have it here tomorrow at this same hour . If I believe you are holding back , your wife will die . If I believe you to be honest , my men will return her to you . " Ajib could see no other choice . " Agreed , " he said , and the robber left . The next day he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He gave it to the robber , who gauged the desperation in Ajib 's eyes and was satisfied . The robber did as he promised , and that evening Taahira was returned . After they had embraced , Taahira said , " I did n't believe you would pay so much money for me . " " I could not take pleasure in it without you , " said Ajib , and he was surprised to realize it was true . " But now I regret that I can not buy you what you deserve . " " You need never buy me anything again , " she said . Ajib bowed his head . " I feel as if I have been punished for my misdeeds . " " What misdeeds ? " asked Taahira , but Ajib said nothing . " I did not ask you this before , " she said . " But I know you did not inherit all the money you gained . Tell me : did you steal it ? " " No , " said Ajib , unwilling to admit the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " " A loan , then ? " " No , it does not need to be repaid . " " And you do n't wish to pay it back ? " Taahira was shocked . " So you are content that this other man paid for our wedding ? That he paid my ransom ? " She seemed on the verge of tears . " Am I your wife then , or this other man 's ? " " You are my wife , " he said . " How can I be , when my very life is owed to another ? " " I would not have you doubt my love , " said Ajib . " I swear to you that I will pay back the money , to the last dirham . " And so Ajib and Taahira moved back into Ajib 's old house and began saving their money . Both of them went to work for Taahira 's brother the apothecary , and when he eventually became a perfumer to the wealthy , Ajib and Taahira took over the business of selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they spent as little as they could , living modestly and repairing damaged furnishings instead of buying new . For years , Ajib smiled whenever he dropped a coin into the chest , telling Taahira that it was a reminder of how much he valued her . He would say that even after the chest was full , it would be a bargain . But it is not easy to fill a chest by adding just a few coins at a time , and so what began as thrift gradually turned into miserliness , and prudent decisions were replaced by tight-fisted ones . Worse , Ajib 's and Taahira 's affections for each other faded over time , and each grew to resent the other for the money they could not spend . In this manner the years passed and Ajib grew older , waiting for the second time that his gold would be taken from him . " What a strange and sad story , " I said . " Indeed , " said Bashaarat . " Would you say that Ajib acted prudently ? " I hesitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge him , " I said . " He must live with the consequences of his actions , just as I must live with mine . " I was silent for a moment , and then said , " I admire Ajib 's candor , that he told you everything he had done . " " Ah , but Ajib did not tell me of this as a young man , " said Bashaarat . " After he emerged from the Gate carrying the chest , I did not see him again for another twenty years . Ajib was a much older man when he came to visit me again . He had come home and found his chest gone , and the knowledge that he had paid his debt made him feel he could tell me all that had transpired . " " Indeed ? Did the older Hassan from your first story come to see you as well ? " " No , I heard Hassan 's story from his younger self . The older Hassan never returned to my shop , but in his place I had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he himself could never have told me . " Bashaarat proceeded to tell me that visitor 's story , and if it pleases Your Majesty , I will recount it here . THE TALE OF THE WIFE AND HER LOVER Raniya had been married to Hassan for many years , and they lived the happiest of lives . One day she saw her husband dine with a young man , whom she recognized as the very image of Hassan when she had first married him . So great was her astonishment that she could scarcely keep herself from intruding on their conversation . After the young man left , she demanded that Hassan tell her who he was , and Hassan related to her an incredible tale . " Have you told him about me ? " she asked . " Did you know what lay ahead of us when we first met ? " " I knew I would marry you from the moment I saw you , " Hassan said , smiling , " but not because anyone had told me . Surely , wife , you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So Raniya did not speak to her husband 's younger self , but only eavesdropped on his conversation , and stole glances at him . Her pulse quickened at the sight of his youthful features ; sometimes our memories fool us with their sweetness , but when she beheld the two men seated opposite each other , she could see the fullness of the younger one 's beauty without exaggeration . At night , she would lie awake , thinking of it . Some days after Hassan had bid farewell to his younger self , he left Cairo to conduct business with a merchant in Damascus . In his absence Raniya found the shop that Hassan had described to her , and stepped through the Gate of Years to the Cairo of her youth . She remembered where he had lived back then , and so was easily able to find the young Hassan and follow him . As she watched him , she felt a desire stronger than she had felt in years for the older Hassan , so vivid were her recollections of their youthful lovemaking . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an opportunity that would never be available again . Resolving to act on this desire , Raniya rented a house , and in subsequent days bought furnishings for it . Once the house was ready , she followed Hassan discreetly while she tried to gather enough boldness to approach him . In the jewelers " market , she watched as he went to a jeweler , showed him a necklace set with ten gemstones , and asked him how much he would pay for it . Raniya recognized it as one Hassan had given to her in the days after their wedding ; she had not known he had once tried to sell it . She stood a short distance away and listened , pretending to look at some rings . " Bring it back tomorrow , and I will pay you a thousand dinars , " said the jeweler . Young Hassan agreed to the price , and left . As she watched him leave , Raniya overheard two men talking nearby : " Did you see that necklace ? It is one of ours . " " Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am . That is the bastard who dug up our chest . " " Let us tell our captain about him . After this fellow has sold his necklace , we will take his money , and more . " The two men left without noticing Raniya , who stood with her heart racing but her body motionless , like a deer after a tiger has passed . She realized that the treasure Hassan had dug up must have belonged to a band of thieves , and these men were two of its members . They were now observing the jewelers of Cairo to identify the person who had taken their loot . Raniya knew that since she possessed the necklace , the young Hassan could not have sold it . She also knew that the thieves could not have killed Hassan . But it could not be Allah 's will for her to do nothing . Allah must have brought her here so that he might use her as his instrument . Raniya returned to the Gate of Years , stepped through to her own day , and at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she used the Gate of Years again , but instead of entering it from the left side , she entered it from the right , so that she visited the Cairo of twenty years later . There she sought out her older self , now an aged woman . The older Raniya greeted her warmly , and retrieved the necklace from her own jewelry box . The two women then rehearsed how they would assist the young Hassan . The next day , the two thieves were back with a third man , whom Raniya assumed was their captain . They all watched as Hassan presented the necklace to the jeweler . As the jeweler examined it , Raniya walked up and said , " What a coincidence ! Jeweler , I wish to sell a necklace just like that . " She brought out her necklace from a purse she carried . " This is remarkable , " said the jeweler . " I have never seen two necklaces more similar . " Then the aged Raniya walked up . " What do I see ? Surely my eyes deceive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third identical necklace . " The seller sold it to me with the promise that it was unique . This proves him a liar . " " Perhaps you should return it , " said Raniya . " That depends , " said the aged Raniya . She asked Hassan , " How much is he paying you for it ? " " A thousand dinars , " " said Hassan , bewildered . " Really ! Jeweler , would you care to buy this one too ? " " I must reconsider my offer , " said the jeweler . While Hassan and the aged Raniya bargained with the jeweler , Raniya stepped back just far enough to hear the captain berate the other thieves . " You fools , " he said . " It is a common necklace . You would have us kill half the jewelers in Cairo and bring the guardsmen down upon our heads . " He slapped their heads and led them off . Raniya returned her attention to the jeweler , who had withdrawn his offer to buy Hassan 's necklace . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to return it to the man who sold it to me . " As the older woman left , Raniya could tell that she smiled beneath her veil . Raniya turned to Hassan . " It appears that neither of us will sell a necklace today . " " Another day , perhaps , " said Hassan . " I shall take mine back to my house for safekeeping , " said Raniya . " Would you walk with me ? " Hassan agreed , and walked with Raniya to the house she had rented . Then she invited him in , and offered him wine , and after they had both drunk some , she led him to her bedroom . She covered the windows with heavy curtains and extinguished all lamps so that the room was as dark as night . Only then did she remove her veil and take him to bed . Raniya had been flush with anticipation for this moment , and so was surprised to find that Hassan 's movements were clumsy and awkward . She remembered their wedding night very clearly ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath away . She knew Hassan 's first meeting with the young Raniya was not far away , and for a moment did not understand how this fumbling boy could change so quickly . And then of course the answer was clear . So every afternoon for many days , Raniya met Hassan at her rented house and instructed him in the art of love , and in doing so she demonstrated that , as is often said , women are Allah 's most wondrous creation . She told him , " The pleasure you give is returned in the pleasure you receive , " and inwardly she smiled as she thought of how true her words really were . Before long , he gained the expertise she remembered , and she took greater enjoyment in it than she had as a young woman . All too soon , the day arrived when Raniya told the young Hassan that it was time for her to leave . He knew better than to press her for her reasons , but asked her if they might ever see each other again . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the furnishings to the house 's owner , and returned through the Gate of Years to the Cairo of her own day . When the older Hassan returned from his trip to Damascus , Raniya was home waiting for him . She greeted him warmly , but kept her secrets to herself . I was lost in my own thoughts when Bashaarat finished this story , until he said , " I see that this story has intrigued you in a way the others did not . " " You see clearly , " I admitted . " I realize now that , even though the past is unchangeable , one may encounter the unexpected when visiting it . " " Indeed . Do you now understand why I say the future and the past are the same ? We can not change either , but we can know both more fully . " " I do understand ; you have opened my eyes , and now I wish to use the Gate of Years . What price do you ask ? " He waved his hand . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Allah guides whom he wishes to my shop , and I am content to be an instrument of his will . " Had it been another man , I would have taken his words to be a negotiating ploy , but after all that Bashaarat had told me , I knew that he was sincere . " Your generosity is as boundless as your learning , " I said , and bowed . " If there is ever a service that a merchant of fabrics might provide for you , please call upon me . " " Thank you . Let us talk now about your trip . There are some matters we must speak of before you visit the Baghdad of twenty years hence . " " I do not wish to visit the future , " I told him . " I would step through in the other direction , to revisit my youth . " " Ah , my deepest apologies . This Gate will not take you there . You see , I built this Gate only a week ago . Twenty years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of . " My dismay was so great that I must have sounded like a forlorn child . I said , " But where does the other side of the Gate lead ? " and walked around the circular doorway to face its opposite side . Bashaarat walked around the doorway to stand beside me . The view through the Gate appeared identical to the view outside it , but when he extended his hand to reach through , it stopped as if it met an invisible wall . I looked more closely , and noticed a brass lamp set on a table . Its flame did not flicker , but was as fixed and unmoving as if the room were trapped in clearest amber . " What you see here is the room as it appeared last week , " said Bashaarat . " In some twenty years " time , this left side of the Gate will permit entry , allowing people to enter from this direction and visit their past . Or , " he said , leading me back to the side of the doorway he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right side now , and visit them ourselves . But I 'm afraid this Gate will never allow visits to the days of your youth . " " What about the Gate of Years you had in Cairo ? " I asked . He nodded . " That Gate still stands . My son now runs my shop there . " " So I could travel to Cairo , and use the Gate to visit the Cairo of twenty years ago . From there I could travel back to Baghdad . " " Yes , you could make that journey , if you so desire . " " I do , " I said . " Will you tell me how to find your shop in Cairo ? " " We must speak of some things first , " said Bashaarat . " I will not ask your intentions , being content to wait until you are ready to tell me . But I would remind you that what is made can not be unmade . " " I know , " I said . " And that you can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allah gives you , you must accept . " " I remind myself of that every day of my life . " " Then it is my honor to assist you in whatever way I can , " he said . He brought out some paper and a pen and inkpot and began writing . " I shall write for you a letter to aid you on your journey . " He folded the letter , dribbled some candle wax over the edge , and pressed his ring against it . " When you reach Cairo , give this to my son , and he will let you enter the Gate of Years there . " A merchant such as myself must be well-versed in expressions of gratitude , but I had never before been as effusive in giving thanks as I was to Bashaarat , and every word was heartfelt . He gave me directions to his shop in Cairo , and I assured him I would tell him all upon my return . As I was about to leave his shop , a thought occurred to me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future , you are assured that the Gate and this shop will be remain standing for twenty years or more . " " Yes , that is true , " said Bashaarat . I began to ask him if he had met his older self , but then I bit back my words . If the answer was no , it was surely because his older self was dead , and I would be asking him if he knew the date of his death . Who was I to make such an inquiry , when this man was granting me a boon without asking my intentions ? I saw from his expression that he knew what I had meant to ask , and I bowed my head in humble apology . He indicated his acceptance with a nod , and I returned home to make arrangements . The caravan took two months to reach Cairo . As for what occupied my mind during the journey , Your Majesty , I now tell you what I had not told Bashaarat . I was married once , twenty years before , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a willow bough and her face was as lovely as the moon , but it was her kind and tender nature that captured my heart . I had just begun my career as a merchant when we married , and we were not wealthy , but did not feel the lack . We had been married only a year when I was to travel to Basra to meet with a ship 's captain . I had an opportunity to profit by trading in slaves , but Najya did not approve . I reminded her that the Koran does not forbid the owning of slaves as long as one treats them well , and that even the Prophet owned some . But she said there was no way I could know how my buyers would treat their slaves , and that it was better to sell goods than men . On the morning of my departure , Najya and I argued . I spoke harshly to her , using words that it shames me to recall , and I beg Your Majesty 's forgiveness if I do not repeat them here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . She was badly injured when the wall of a mosque collapsed , some days after I left . She was taken to the bimaristan , but the physicians could not save her , and she died soon after . I did not learn of her death until I returned a week later , and I felt as if I had killed her with my own hand . Can the torments of Hell be worse than what I endured in the days that followed ? It seemed likely that I would find out , so near to death did my anguish take me . And surely the experience must be similar , for like infernal fire , grief burns but does not consume ; instead , it makes the heart vulnerable to further suffering . Eventually my period of lamentation ended , and I was left a hollow man , a bag of skin with no innards . I freed the slaves I had bought and became a fabric merchant . Over the years I became wealthy , but I never remarried . Some of the men I did business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter , telling me that the love of a woman can make you forget your pains . Perhaps they are right , but it can not make you forget the pain you caused another . Whenever I imagined myself marrying another woman , I remembered the look of hurt in Najya 's eyes when I last saw her , and my heart was closed to others . I spoke to a mullah about what I had done , and it was he who told me that repentance and atonement erase the past . I repented and atoned as best I knew how , - for twenty years I lived as an upright man , I offered prayers and fasted and gave alms to those less fortunate and made a Pilgrimage to Mecca , and yet I was still haunted by guilt . Allah is all-merciful , so I knew the failing to be mine . Had Bashaarat asked me , I could not have said what I hoped to achieve . It was clear from his stories that I could not change what I knew to have happened . No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our final conversation . But the tale of Raniya , which lay hidden within the tale of Hassan 's life without his knowing it , gave me a slim hope : perhaps I might be able to play some part in events while my younger self was away on business . Could it not be that there had been a mistake , and my Najya had survived ? Perhaps it was another woman whose body had been wrapped in a shroud and buried while I was gone . Perhaps I could rescue Najya and bring her back with me to the Baghdad of my own day . I knew it was foolhardy ; men of experience say , " Four things do not come back : the spoken word , the sped arrow , the past life , and the neglected opportunity , " and I understood the truth of those words better than most . And yet I dared to hope that Allah had judged my twenty years of repentance sufficient , and was now granting me a chance to regain what I had lost . The caravan journey was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I reached Cairo . There I had to navigate the city 's streets , which are a bewildering maze compared to the harmonious design of the City of Peace . I made my way to the Bayn al-Qasrayn , the main street that runs through the Fatimid quarter of Cairo . From there I found the street on which Bashaarat 's shop was located . I told the shopkeeper that I had spoken to his father in Baghdad , and gave him the letter Bashaarat had given me . After reading it , he led me into a back room , in whose center stood another Gate of Years , and he gestured for me to enter from its left side . As I stood before the massive circle of metal , I felt a chill , and chided myself for my nervousness . With a deep breath I stepped through , and found myself in the same room with different furnishings . If not for those , I would not have known the Gate to be different from an ordinary doorway . Then I recognized that the chill I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this room , for the day here was not as hot as the day I had left . I could feel its warm breeze at my back , coming through the Gate like a sigh . The shopkeeper followed behind me and called out , " Father , you have a visitor . " A man entered the room , and who should it be but Bashaarat , twenty years younger than when I 'd seen him in Baghdad . " Welcome , my lord , " he said . " I am Bashaarat . " " You do not know me ? " I asked . " No , you must have met my older self . For me , this is our first meeting , but it is my honor to assist you . " Your Majesty , as befits this chronicle of my shortcomings , I must confess that , so immersed was I in my own woes during the journey from Baghdad , I had not previously realized that Bashaarat had likely recognized me the moment I stepped into his shop . Even as I was admiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would travel to Cairo , and likely knew whether I had achieved my goal or not . The Bashaarat I spoke to now knew none of those things . " I am doubly grateful for your kindness , sir , " I said . " My name is Fuwaad ibn Abbas , newly arrived from Baghdad . " Bashaarat 's son took his leave , and Bashaarat and I conferred ; I asked him the day and month , confirming that there was ample time for me to travel back to the City of Peace , and promised him I would tell him everything when I returned . His younger self was as gracious as his older . " I look forward to speaking with you on your return , and to assisting you again twenty years from now , " he said . His words gave me pause . " Had you planned to open a shop in Baghdad before today ? " " Why do you ask ? " " I had been marveling at the coincidence that we met in Baghdad just in time for me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel back . But now I wonder if it is perhaps not a coincidence at all . Is my arrival here today the reason that you Will move to Baghdad twenty years from now ? " Bashaarat smiled . " Coincidence and intention are two sides of a tapestry , my lord . You may find one more agreeable to look at , but you can not say one is true and the other is false . " " Now as ever , you have given me much to think about , " I said . I thanked him and bid farewell . As I was leaving his shop , I passed a woman entering with some haste . I heard Bashaarat greet her as Raniya , and stopped in surprise . From just outside the door , I could hear the woman say , " I have the necklace . I hope my older self has not lost it . " " I am sure you will have kept it safe , in anticipation of your visit , " said Bashaarat . I realized that this was Raniya from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to collect her older self so that they might return to the days of their youth , confound some thieves with a doubled necklace , and save their husband . For a moment I was unsure if I were dreaming or awake , because I felt as if I had stepped into a tale , and the thought that I might talk to its players and partake of its events was dizzying . I was tempted to speak , and see if I might play a hidden role in that tale , but then I remembered that my goal was to play a hidden role in my own tale . So I left without a word , and went to arrange passage with a caravan . It is said , Your Majesty , that Fate laughs at men 's schemes . At first it appeared as if I were the most fortunate of men , for a caravan headed for Baghdad was departing within the month , and I was able to join it . In the weeks that followed I began to curse my luck , because the caravan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a town not far from Cairo were dry , and an expedition had to be sent back for water . At another village , the soldiers protecting the caravan contracted dysentery , and we had to wait for weeks for their recovery . With each delay , I revised my estimate of when we 'd reach Baghdad , and grew increasingly anxious . Then there were the sandstorms , which seemed like a warning from Allah , and truly caused me to doubt the wisdom of my actions . We had the good fortune to be resting at a caravanserai west of Kufa when the sandstorms first struck , but our stay was prolonged from days to weeks as , time and again , the skies became clear , only to darken again as soon as the camels were reloaded . The day of Najya 's accident was fast approaching , and I grew desperate . I solicited each of the camel drivers in turn , trying to hire one to take me ahead alone , but could not persuade any of them . Eventually I found one willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exorbitant price under ordinary circumstances , but which I was all too willing to pay . I then struck out on my own . It will come as no surprise that I made little progress in the storm , but when the winds subsided , I immediately adopted a rapid pace . Without the soldiers that accompanied the caravan , however , I was an easy target for bandits , and sure enough , I was stopped after two days " ride . They took my money and the camel I had purchased , but spared my life , whether out of pity or because they could not be bothered to kill me I do not know . I began walking back to rejoin the caravan , but now the skies tormented me with their cloudlessness , and I suffered from the heat . By the time the caravan found me , my tongue was swollen and my lips were as cracked as mud baked by the sun . After that I had no choice but to accompany the caravan at its usual pace . Like a fading rose that drops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each passing day . By the time the caravan reached the City of Peace , I knew it was too late , but the moment we rode through the city gates , I asked the guardsmen if they had heard of a mosque collapsing . The first guardsman I spoke to had not , and for a heartbeat I dared to hope that I had misremembered the date of the accident , and that I had in fact arrived in time . Then another guardsman told me that a mosque had indeed collapsed just yesterday in the Karkh quarter . His words struck me with the force of the executioner 's axe . I had traveled so far , only to receive the worst news of my life a second time . I walked to the mosque , and saw the piles of bricks where there had once been a wall . It was a scene that had haunted my dreams for twenty years , but now the image remained even after I opened my eyes , and with a clarity sharper than I could endure . I turned away and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until I found myself before my old house , the one where Najya and I had lived . I stood in the street in front of it , filled with memory and anguish . I do not know how much time had passed when I became aware that a young woman had walked up to me . " My lord , " she said , " I 'm looking for the house of Fuwaad ibn Abbas . " " You have found it , " I said . " Are you Fuwaad ibn Abbas , my lord ? " " I am , and I ask you , please leave me be . " " My lord , I beg your forgiveness . My name is Maimuna , and I assist the physicians at the bimaristan . I tended to your wife before she died . " I turned to look at her . " You tended to Najya ? " " I did , my lord . I am sworn to deliver a message to you from her . " " What message ? " " She wished me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She wished me to tell you that while her life was short , it was made happy by the time she spent with you . " She saw the tears streaming down my cheeks , and said , " Forgive me if my words cause you pain , my lord . " " There is nothing to forgive , child . Would that I had the means to pay you as much as this message is worth , to me , because a lifetime of thanks would still leave me in your debt . " " Grief owes no debt , " she said . " Peace be upon you , my lord . " " Peace be upon you , " I said . She left , and I wandered the streets for hours , crying tears of release . All the while I thought on the truth of Bashaarat 's words : past and future are the same , and we can not change either , only know them more fully . My journey to the past had changed nothing , but what I had learned had changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been otherwise . If our lives are tales that Allah tells , then we are the audience as well as the players , and it is by living these tales that we receive their lessons . Night fell , and it was then that the city 's guardsmen found me , wandering the streets after curfew in my dusty clothes , and asked who I was . I told them my name and where I lived , and the guardsmen brought me to my neighbors to see if they knew me , but they did not recognize me , and I was taken to jail . I told the guard captain my story , and he found it entertaining , but did not credit it , for who would ? Then I remembered some news from my time of grief twenty years before , and told him that Your Majesty 's grandson would be born an albino . Some days later , word of the infant 's condition reached the captain , and he brought me to the governor of the quarter . When the governor heard my story , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lord chamberlain heard my story , he in turn brought me here to the throne room , so that I might have the infinite privilege of recounting it to Your Majesty . Now my tale has caught up to my life , coiled as they both are , and the direction they take next is for Your Majesty to decide . I know many things that will happen here in Baghdad over the next twenty years , but nothing about what awaits me now . I have no money for the journey back to Cairo and the Gate of Years there , yet I count myself fortunate beyond measure , for I was given the opportunity to revisit my past mistakes , and I have learned what remedies Allah allows . I would be honored to relate everything I know of the future , if Your Majesty sees fit to ask , but for myself , the most precious knowledge I possess is this : Nothing erases the past . There is repentance , there is atonement , and there is forgiveness . That is all , but that is enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
