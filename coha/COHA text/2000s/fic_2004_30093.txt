Sand Trap Before he became fully conscious he heard the woman 's voice and some sixth sense of warning held him motionless . Her voice was sharp , impatient . " Just start the fire and let 's get out of here ! " " Why leave that money on him ? It will just burn up . " " Do n't be such an idiot ! " her voice shrilled . " The police test ashes and they could tell whether there was money or not . . . do n't look at me like that ! It has to look like a robbery . " " I do n't like this , Paula . " " Oh , do n't be a fool ! Now start the fire and come on ! " " All right . " Monte Jackson held himself perfectly still . Despite the pounding in his skull he knew what was happening now . They believed him dead or unconscious and , for some reason , planned to burn the house and him with it . From some distance away he heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except for the ticking of a clock . Returning consciousness brought with it pain , a heavy , swollen pain in the back of his head . He opened his eyes and saw linoleum , ( turquoise and black squares ) , an edge of enameled metal and beyond it , lying against the wall in what he now realized was the dark corner behind a washing machine , a man 's dress sock , lightly covered with dust . His head hurt , it hurt badly and he was n't sure he could move . His fingers twitched . . . okay , movement was possible . He did n't get up , but he thought about it . . . were they gone ? Who were they ? A woman . He could almost remember her , something . . . He smelled smoke . Smoke ! And not wood smoke either , burning plastic , amongst other things . He was definitely going to have to get up . He lurched to his knees , sending a flurry of twenty- and one-hundred-dollar bills to the floor ; his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was in the utility room of a house somewhere , flames crackled , there was money everywhere . He grabbed the side of the washing machine and stood up , a haze of smoke hung in the doorway before him , he stumbled forward into a kitchen . Behind him there was a good two thousand dollars in currency scattered on the floor . . . but other things had his attention . The pain and the increase in light blurred his vision . A roll of paper towels , conveniently placed near a burner on the gas range , was spreading fire to items left on the counter , brown paper bags from the market , a wooden box built to hold milk bottles , and from there to the gaily colored drapes over the sink . . . one whole side of the room was in flames . On the floor lay a man in his shirtsleeves and wearing an apron , a caked reddish-brown stain on his side . Beside him lay two items . A small pistol and a heavy , cast-iron pan . Monte Jackson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of his head . It was only then that he noticed the food that was splattered all over his right shoulder and sleeve . He touched his scalp and nearly lost his balance . It was split , split to the bone . He turned , and as the lightbulb over the sink burst from the heat of the fire , staggered to a door that looked like it opened onto a side yard ; he yanked at the knob . It turned but the door would n't open , it just rattled in the jamb . A lock ? The heat was like the broiling desert sun and growing even more intense . The lock needed a key . . . and the key was not in it . As the paint began to blister on the wall next to him , Monte Jackson dropped to all-fours and crawled into the burning kitchen , desperately headed for the door that he assumed led to the dining room . He slipped in the sauce that covered the floor near the body , his hand hit the pistol and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swinging door and he was suddenly in the comparative calm of a butler 's pantry . Shadows thrown by the flames fled ahead of Jackson as he scrambled to his feet and ran down the hallway . Past the dining room , the living room , then the front door was before him . He slid to a stop ; a faint whistling sound came from under the door . . . air rushing into the house , feeding the fire that was spreading in the kitchen and licking its way down the ceiling of the hallway . He could feel its heat at his back . Jackson turned the knob and pulled the door open . It came easily , like one of those automatic doors in a supermarket , the pressure of the outside air pushing it inward . The fire roared to greater life behind him , flames pouring up the stairwell and into the second floor . Jackson stumbled across a wide front porch and down a short set of concrete steps , the free warm air of the summer night enfolding him . He swayed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a building with arches along the sidewalk , sitting in a bar , a girl . . . Riverside . He was in Riverside . He had been in the bar at the Mission Inn ! Fire lit the second-floor windows of the house . He had to call the fire department . . . but , what of the man on the floor ? The man was dead . The man was dead and he probably owned the house that was burning . Monte Jackson wanted to be far away . Far away in a place where none of this could have happened . Headlights swung into the front yard and Jackson turned . But the car was not coming in from the road , it had been parked behind the house , near the detached garage . " It 's him ! You idiot , get him ! " He heard the woman 's harsh voice again , and suddenly the car accelerated . Jackson backed up , turned , then ran . The dark sedan sprayed gravel as a heavy foot was applied to the gas . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but was up with a lunge and into the shrubbery , slamming blindly into a woven wire fence , hitting it hard enough to throw him back , he ploughed on . The car ground to a stop , caught in the hedge , and he heard the doors pop open . There was a shot . He felt the hot breath of the bullet pass his cheek . He crouched and ran , sighted a gate . . . how he got through it and into the orchard beyond he never knew . Twice he stumbled and fell headlong , but forced himself to keep running until he was completely out of breath . As his head cleared he caught the sound of tires as a car drove by on gravel . Following the sound , he emerged from the brush on the lip of a ravine dividing the wood from a county road . It was not a main road but , by the look of it , plenty of cars were passing . If he could get a lift , get out of here , well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his appearance and lifting a fumbling hand , felt gingerly of the wound along his scalp . There was dried blood in his hair and on his cheek and ear . The sound of water led him to an irrigation ditch where he dropped to his knees and bathed the blood away , then dried himself with his shirt and handkerchief . Carefully , he combed hair over the wound to try to conceal it . Behind him , the orchard was silhouetted against the glowing cloud of smoke that rose from the fire . So what had happened ? Well , there was the lounge at the Mission Inn . A girl , pretty enough . . . pretty enough for a man who had spent the last three months in the desert . He had caught her eye momentarily , but what would a girl like that want with him ? Unfortunately , it was all coming back to him . The girl , woman , ( he had other names for her now ) . . . had been well dressed but was obviously nervous . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar , watching her . The two never spoke but Monte Jackson had n't been in the desert so long that he was blind ; the man did n't want to be noticed , but he was watching the woman whose name , Jackson now knew , was Paula . He had finished his drink and left the bar , there was no time in his life right now for women ; few women would tolerate the way he was living . There was also no time in his life for whatever kind of drama was brewing between her and the man at the bar . He had no time for it , but when the dark sedan had pulled up beside him as he walked down the street , he had found himself involved , regardless . After cleaning up , he decided against trying to get a ride . Although he was hurt , a minor concussion , at least , a torn scalp , bruises and scrapes from his escape , and a nasty cough from the smoke he had inhaled , he had to think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so close to a fire , would draw unwanted attention . His memories were sorting themselves out and he thought he knew where he was . A little farm , a nice gentlemanly farm , on the outskirts of Riverside . He turned right and started walking along the road . Occasionally cars sped past . At first he ducked into the ditch when he saw them coming , fearing a bullet from Paula or her friend . But soon after he started out he had heard fire engines in the distance , probably on a parallel road , and figured that Paula might be busier trying to explain to the cops and the fire crew what had happened than she was trying to find him . So he walked along the shoulder of the road , squinting against the dust of passing cars , until he came to an intersection . The new road was paved , and on the other side , under a streetlamp , was an empty bus stop . The bus got him within a block of the El Mirage Motel where , earlier in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor . He no longer had his key but the desk clerk remembered him and gave him another . The room was as he had left it just hours before . He went to the bathroom and washed his face and scalp again . Though very painful , he cleaned the wound , and that started it bleeding again . He tore strips from a towel and bound it up as best he could , the kind of pressure it needed was impossible , for the bruising was worse than the cut . He slipped out of his torn and filthy clothes and noticed that the pockets were almost empty . . . it was not only his room key that was gone , his wallet was missing too ! He sat down next to the telephone . He should call the police . That was simple . That was the right thing to do . And what would he tell them ? Well , the truth ; a woman had picked him up in her car as he left the lounge at the Mission Inn . She had said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to see her home . Her husband , a local doctor , would then drive him wherever he wanted to go . It had made sense at the time . Once at the farm , she had asked if he wanted a drink . When he said yes , she 'd suggested that he get a coaster out of the cabinet behind him . He had turned , and when he had turned back , the big man from the bar had been standing there and had hit him on the head with the cast-iron pan . He 'd fallen to his knees and the man had hit him again . The last thing that he remembered was the woman , Paula , fitting his hand around a small automatic pistol . . . curling his fingers around it , then carrying it away in a handkerchief . He was a patsy . The two had set him up but it had n't worked . He definitely should call the police . Except that thought worried him . With his wallet gone he had no ID . No one knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service he had spent prospecting in the desert . His terminal leave pay and what he had saved financed the venture , for his expenses had been small . He 'd never had an address or a job anywhere except for the Army and he 'd only gone there because a judge had given him a choice , the military . . . or jail . He had a record , that could be a problem . Breaking and entering with a gang of other kids from Tempe . His uncle , an old jackass prospector , had taken a strap to him many a time but it had n't helped . The Army had and after eight years in a ranger company he had emerged a different man . None of which was going to help him now . He had escaped but the woman was going to have a lot of explaining to do and he was suddenly certain of what she was going to say . The very story she had tried to set up in the first place would be her best bet now . Someone had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was it her husband ? ) , the house had caught fire just as she was returning home . He did n't know exactly how she 'd spin it but he had no doubt that she would identify him as the killer . . . and she probably had his wallet . He felt short of breath and his throat was tight . Everything he had learned in the Army told him to call the police . But his childhood , the poor kid raised in an ovenlike trailer who had been chased by the cops down dusty alleys and through weed-grown scrap yards , said something else . The world he lived in now was not the world of the military . He could not count on officials being the hard but fair officers he had once known . He could not count on those around him to take responsibility for their actions or to take pride in their honesty . In the end he split the difference . Quickly dressing in clean clothes , he packed his bag and , using a stash of money left in his shaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat on over the makeshift bandage and set out for the bus station . After buying his ticket he turned to a phone booth and , pulling the door shut , dropped a dime in the slot . After speaking with an operator and holding for a minute or so a voice responded . " Robbery-Homicide , Lieutenant Ragan speaking . " Jackson took a deep breath . " Lieutenant Ragan , do n't think this is a crank call . I 'm going to outline a case for you . Listen . . . . " Without mentioning his name he outlined his story from the moment he 'd been accosted by the woman on the street . He told how he was lured into her home , that he 'd been knocked out , and the plans to fire the house . He ended suddenly . " Ragan , I need help . This man , whoever he was , was killed , shot , and these people are looking for a cover story . . . something that does n't implicate them . I 'm not a killer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ca n't you ?
