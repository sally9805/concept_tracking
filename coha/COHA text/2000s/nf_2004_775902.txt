The Reunion // TO BE IN NEW ENGLAND on the first Saturday in September when the Red Sox are in a pennant race , when college football is beginning again and the first hints of fall are in the air , is to be about as close to heaven as one can come while still on earth . // On just such a day in 2003 , on a morning when the sky was brilliantly blue and the temperature at sunrise was in the low 60s , a far-flung family gathered at 416 Brenda Lane in Franklin , a Boston suburb about twenty-five miles southwest of Kenmore Square and Fenway Park . Jay and Natalie Edwards had driven from their retirement home in Vero Beach , Florida , stopping in Annapolis on the way to spend a little extra time with their daughter Chris , her husband , John , and their two children . Chris , the oldest of the four Edwards children , is , like her husband , a retired Navy veteran . After Jay and Natalie continued their drive north , Chris and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the second son , and his wife , Laurie , had the longest trip , coming from their home in Steamboat Springs , Colorado . They had flown east on Wednesday and had spent time on Cape Cod riding bicycles and roller-blading . Rare was the day in their lives when they did n't bike or run or blade or look for something new and different-to attempt . Gwyn and Lenny were the only ones who did n't have to travel , because they were the hosts , which meant they had the most work to do . That was how they wanted it , though , especially Gwyn , the baby in the family . She had retired from a successful career in public relations to raise their three children , who now ranged in age from five and a half to two and a half . It was Gwyn who had first come up with the idea to get everyone together and Gwyn who had pushed everyone else to make sure it happened . // Technically this was not a reunion but a chance to celebrate the wedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second child and the first son , had married Marsha Cummins Moore on a beach in Hawaii in February , almost thirty years after they first met and five weeks after they had become engaged . // The engagement had caught the family a little off guard ; they had n't known there was someone serious in Bruce 's life . The wedding had been a complete surprise , because it had all happened in less than a week . Hilary Watson , whose husband , Tom , had been Bruce 's boss for almost his entire adult life , had suggested it to Marsha on a Monday and the ceremony had taken place six days later on the beach . Friends had commented that it was typical of Bruce to find a way to get married in his bare feet . // Tom Watson was Bruce 's best man . In his toast to the bride and groom he had commented that this was a marriage that was beginning under very difficult circumstances . " The groom , " he said , " is a lifelong Eagles fan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why it took so long for them to finally get together . Clearly , they are going to have a lot of work to do . " // When the rest of the family heard about the wedding , they were taken by surprise , but they also understood . Everyone talked about getting together at some point at Bruce and Marsha 's home in Florida to celebrate . But there was no specific date or plan . Late in March , as was almost always the case on weekends , Gwyn and Lenny had the TV tuned to that week 's golf tournament . It was the Players Championship . Gwyn was walking through the living room when she heard NBC 's Jimmy Roberts mention the name Bruce Edwards . // She stopped and sat down . A moment later her big brother was on the screen . She took a deep breath when she saw him and tried not to cry . // Bruce 's voice was thick , his words difficult to understand , almost as if he 'd been drinking . That was n't a surprise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the weeks since the wedding and knew that was how he sounded now . " But I had n't seen him , " she said . " When I saw how thin he was , when I saw how different he looked in just a few weeks , that 's when it really hit me . That was when I first thought to myself , ' We have to get everyone together - soon . ' " // Months later , sitting on a couch in the living room with Lenny next to her , she still found it difficult to say exactly why the thought had crossed her mind that day . " I do n't honestly remember if I thought it specifically , " she said . " But obviously it was somewhere in my mind . " // Somewhere in her mind was the thought that could n't be avoided - not on that afternoon in March nor on that spectacular Saturday in September : If we do n't get the family together soon , the next time might be at Bruce 's funeral . // Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty-eight , an unsmiling doctor at the Mayo Clinic had said to him , " Do you know what ALS is ? It 's also known as Lou Gehrig 's disease . In all likelihood , you have one to three years to live . " // Just like that . No ifs or ands or buts . He had issued what was , essentially , a death sentence , almost as if he were a judge telling a criminal his decision based on the facts before him . // That had been on a cold , snowy January day in Minnesota . A lot had happened since then , much of it good , some of it extraordinary . Bruce had been to many different doctors and had been told many different things about how he could get better . But the disease was still progressing . Bruce knew it , Marsha knew it , the family knew it . // When Bruce and Marsha arrived at Gwyn and Lenny 's house that Friday night in September , there was a plate of mussels , courtesy of Brian and Laurie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lenny had managed to finish building in time for the weekend . " Try a couple , " Brian advised his older brother . " They 're delicious . " // " Great , " Bruce said with the wicked smile that was his trademark . " Can they cure ALS ? " // Everyone laughed . It was a funny line , typical Bruce . And then everyone sat back and the cool evening was completely silent for a moment . // In all there were seventeen of them gathered at 416 Brenda Lane , the house that Gwyn and Lenny had moved into ten months earlier . In addition to Jay and Natalie Edwards , the patriarch and matriarch , and their four children and their spouses , there were seven children , ranging in age from fifteen-year-old Natalie , John and Chris 's oldest , down to little Jay , Lenny and Gwyn 's youngest . Gwyn and Lenny had rented a moon-bounce for the weekend , and it proved to be a masterstroke , keeping the kids busy with little squabbling . That left the adults time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wonder if the Red Sox might finally be for real , and of course reminisce and remember . // " Thank God Bruce was always the kind of kid who stuck to his guns , " Jay Edwards said on Friday evening , shortly before Bruce arrived . // " Those first few years , we kept waiting for him to say ' enough , ' and come home and go to college . Who knows , if he had n't ended up with Tom Watson maybe he would have come home , but I 'm not sure . He loved the life out there . He made lots of friends , good friends , and he really found a niche doing what he was doing . He was right , we were wrong . I 'm really proud of what he has become . " // Bruce Edwards would have loved hearing his father say those words . For years , he was convinced that he would never hear them , because his father was incapable of believing them . One of the jokes among the Edwards children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made himself an excellent living as a caddy on the PGA Tour for years and years , was that Mom and Dad were still waiting for him to grow up , go to college , and find a real job . It was almost like the old joke about the mother of the first Jewish president , who leans over to the person sitting next to her during the inaugural address and says , " You know , my other son 's a doctor . " // Their son had become the king of the caddies . He was the best in the world at a profession that had earned respectability in large part because of the work done by him and his contemporaries . They had changed the image of the tour caddy from irresponsible hanger-onto respected partner . And yet Jay and Natalie were still waiting for him to come home and become a doctor . Or a lawyer . Or a dentist . // In fact Bruce often told people that his parents ' proudest moment watching him caddy had not come at the 1982 U.S. Open , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golf 's most famous shot , holing an impossible chip at the 17th hole - after which Watson pointed his finger at Bruce and said , " I told you I was gon na make it ! " Their proudest moment came two years later , at the 1984 U.S. Open . Walking outside the ropes , the Edwardses were there when someone pointed at Tom Watson and said , " It 's him . " // " Not it 's him , " Bruce Edwards corrected . " It 's he . " Then he paused for a second , glanced at his parents , and said , " And I 'll bet you never thought you 'd hear that from a caddy . " // There had never been anything very typical about Bruce as a caddy . His relationship with Watson had been built on many things , not the least of which was his willingness to disagree with his boss , even challenge him on occasion . Watson had enough self-confidence that he did n't mind being told he was wrong . The two of them argued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the credit for that relationship to Watson . " He let me be wrong , " he said . " I never said anything thinking that if I was wrong , I 'd get fired or yelled at . Sometimes he listened to me , sometimes he did n't . But once he made his decision , he always took responsibility for the outcome . " // " I 'm not much of a whiner and Bruce is n't a whiner , " is how Watson describes the way they worked together . " We just both go out there and do our jobs . " // From 1973 until the middle of 1989 , they had done their jobs together , appearing to most in golf to be a matched set . Sometimes when they walked the fairways side by side , it appeared they were connected by an invisible string . Their walking paces were identical - fast - and neither one ever seemed to get his head down or pout on days when things did n't go well . Watson almost never lost his bouncy step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his caddy matched him every step of the way . They had separated for three years when Watson cut back on his playing schedule and encouraged Bruce to accept an offer from Greg Norman , then the number one player in the world . // But in ' 92 Bruce had returned , and they 'd worked together ever since - more than twenty-five years as partners . " It really was n't the same without him , " Watson said years later , looking back at their three-year separation . " I missed his personality and I missed having someone there who knew me so well I did n't even have to think before I did anything . " // Bruce came back in the fall of ' 92 and , in many ways , it was as if he had never been away . They fell back into their same old arguments : Watson 's Royals vs . Edwards 's Phillies ; Watson 's conservative politics vs . Edwards 's far more moderate views ; the annual bet on the NCAA basketball tournament . They really were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they finish each other 's sentences and know one another 's thoughts . // When Watson turned fifty in 1999 and moved over to the Senior Tour , Bruce had plenty of chances to work for other top players on the more lucrative and far more enjoyable PGA Tour . // In truth Bruce , like Watson , would have loved to stay on the PGA Tour forever . The Senior Tour is a shadow of the " real " tour . Most of its tournaments are 54 holes with no cut , as opposed to the PGA Tour 's 72 holes with a 36-hole cut . The crowds most weeks are little more than a handful and there is a heavy emphasis on pro-ams , because the tour is so dependent on corporate America to keep the dollars flowing . What 's more , most of the golf courses are set up short and easy to create the illusion that the over-fifty set can still score the way they did when they were younger . Watson has never been a short and easy sort of golfer . He likes golf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing his best golf in the worst possible conditions - one of the reasons he won the often weather-challenged British Open five times . // Watson was still good enough to win on the regular tour a few months before he turned forty-nine . He still craves going out and competing with the kids , but his post-fifty body wo n't let him practice and grind the way he did when he was younger . That makes it unrealistic for him to tee it up with the youngsters on a regular basis , and playing with the seniors week in and week out does n't motivate him the way he was motivated when he was younger . " There 's nothing wrong with the Senior Tour , " Watson insists . " I like it fine . But I 'm not able to practice and work like I did when I was younger , so it 's different than it was back then . I have to approach it differently simply because it is different . " // Bruce could have left Watson when he turned fifty for almost any player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men on tour . He would have made more money , and , again , Watson would have understood , because Watson is both a businessman and an older brother figure to Bruce . " When he told me about having the chance to go work for Greg , I told him , ' Go for it , ' " Watson said . " It was like a father pushing a son out of the nest . There was too much money on the table potentially to pass it up . " // Bruce remembers Watson being even more direct back then : " ' You need to do this , ' he said . ' I ca n't win for you anymore . ' " That was at a low point of Watson 's career , when the swing and putting stroke that had made him the world 's best player had deserted him . If Bruce had left again in 1999 or 2000 , not wanting to go the Senior Tour route , Watson would have understood again . // But there was absolutely no way Bruce was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mini-tour in Florida , or decided to try to win all the state championships of the Midwest . He had left home once . He had no intention of leaving him again . " As long as Tom wants me , I 'll never leave him , " he said once . " He 's a lot more than just my boss . He 's my friend , he 's my best adviser . " // He smiled . " Of course I do n't always listen to him , sort of like I did n't always listen to my dad . But I 'm not leaving Tom Watson . // He 'll have to fire me to get rid of me again . " Of course Watson would never fire Bruce . Each had been the constant - except for that three-year window - in the other 's adult life . Each had been married and divorced and remarried in the thirty years that they had known one another . Bruce had watched Watson 's children grow up , and Watson , after joining Edwards 's parents in pushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was n't going to happen . " He 's a gypsy at heart , " Watson liked to say . //
