For this psych-fi chiller , Timothy Findley 's choice of psychiatrist is not the over-familiar Sigmund Freud but his rival Carl Jung , herald of the theory of collective unconscious . Jung 's fictive patient , known as Pilgrim , is an X-Filer 's dream and an HMO 's nightmare : every time he dies , he comes back to life . Pilgrim is obviously a dramatization of Jung 's doctrines . Too obviously . The action is bracketed by the 1912 sinking of the Titanic and the first day of World War I in 1914 , and the apocalyptic deep-think brings to mind Peter DeVries ' remark about a writer who figuratively puts his readers in a diving bell and takes them down 3 ft . <P>  --  By R.Z.
