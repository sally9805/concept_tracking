Some of the South 's prettiest seasonal displays bloom this month and next in Atlanta . The city 's neighborhoods invite us to park our cars and leave the traffic behind .

Ansley Park 's Dogwood Days Sometimes the best walks await just around the corner . Such is the case with Ansley Park , a garden neighborhood on the National Register of Historic Places and tucked between Peachtree Street 's High Museum of Art and Piedmont Park . You can get there from the MARTA Arts Center Station .

The homes all show the affluence of their time , mixing Italianate villas with Romanesque , Craftsman , and Georgian styles .

Inman Park began in 1889 , just 2 miles from downtown . The neighborhood fell into neglect after World War I ; then rigorous restoration began in the 1970s . Today , it 's a delightful area with lovingly maintained historic homes alongside some modern interpretations of traditional styles . Amid the dogwood blossoms , wisteria , and huge mounds of azaleas reside homes with elegant porches , intricate gingerbread , and towering turrets. // Inman Park is very accessible , and one of the best ways to explore it is on an Atlanta Preservation Center tour ( $10 per person , March 1 through November 30 ) .
