<p> In the decade after the first Earth Day 34 years ago , people planted trees to fight smog , picketed toxic dumps , slogged through mud to clean up grungy river banks . Being Earth-friendly meant giving $ 25 to save the whales - or choosing unleaded gas at the pump . <p> But in the new millennium , using a trash can to " keep America beautiful " is not enough . One of the planet 's most pressing problems - global warming - looks to be one of its most intractable . And that is proving frustrating to would-be activists . <p> Their challenge : How to get individuals to change their behavior for a problem that looms so large and is unlikely to be solved for generations . <p> " Environment took off as an issue in the 1970s because you could do something personal about recycling and pollution in neighborhoods , " says Dale Jamieson , president of the International Society for Environmental Ethics . " One of the dangers of thinking about the global warming issue today is that it can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , here and there , a hardy strain of personal action is taking root at the local level . <p> Ask Michael Charney about the clothesline across his living room or Seth Riney about his hybrid-car limo service or Melanie Aron about her congregation 's solar panels . They all give the same explanation : " Global warming . " <p> Dr. Charney , a psychiatrist turned environmental activist , who lives in Cambridge , Mass. , has not owned a car since 1995 - the year he began pondering deeply the global warming issue . Instead he bikes , uses public transportation and last year joined " Zipcar , " a car- sharing service that lets him grab a car on very short notice when he absolutely has to have one to go somewhere . <p> " I do n't fly , " Dr. Charney says , then recants : " I had to fly twice recently for family funerals . But otherwise I confine myself to ground transportation because jets are major contributor to global warming . " <p> Charney was always an activist but only recently an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nader raider " in 1969 , working on occupational health and safety issues . Later he joined the fight against big tobacco companies . But it was a professor 's lecture at a 1988 reunion at Yale that shocked him : Global warming was coming , and it made all the other issues insignificant by comparison . <p> " I walked out of the lecture feeling so weak , " he recalls . " It was overwhelming . Look at one smokestack and compare it to a cigarette . Then there was the exhaust coming out of cars and stoves and planes . It was everywhere ... I was overwhelmed . I could n't touch it . " <p> He spent seven years unable to grasp what he could possibly do about the problem , focusing on his psychiatry practice , playing cello , and a program to teach inner-city kids to play chess to counter violence . But global warming still lurked in the back of his mind , he says . <p> Then he quit everything and went to Alaska in 1994 . Living in Bethel , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ohio , he made ends meet working as a reporter for a local newspaper and interviewing native Alaskans . <p> " I became an environmentalist in Alaska , " he says . " It re- awakened my concern about global warming . I still remember one native woman . She was complaining how hot it was that summer - 70 degrees . " <p> A year later he was back in Boston with a mission . He began to educate himself by reading books on global warming . Though a neophyte in the environmental field , he began to realize a critical missing piece was public support - and he could contribute his skill at grass-roots organizing . <p> In 1998 he began phoning towns in New England , looking for anyone who was addressing global warming . Few were . But little by little , he and fellow activist Marc Breslow began pulling threads together , and the Massachusetts Climate Action Network was born - 15 or so cities and towns working to purchase clean power and use energy efficiently . <p> " I had a room with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you have a list of people to call , and time to do it , you can change the world . " <p> Many see in climate change a problem so vast and complex that - in the absence of international treaties to cut emissions - individual actions may seem irrelevant . Yet global warming " is not primarily a scientific problem , " Dr. Jamieson says . " It is an ethical and political problem concerning individual values . " <p> And that 's why Seth Riney started Planetran , the nation 's first limo company that uses only low-emissions , hybrid Toyota Prius cars to ferry passengers to and from Boston 's Logan Airport . <p> Trained as an astrophysicist , Mr. Riney worked as an engineer on satellite projects for an aerospace company in southern California . He shifted to a project to develop intelligent vehicles and lane-change warning devices . Then he leaped to a high-tech firm to write software . <p> After the dot.com crash , he remained a freelance software consultant making good money - but searching for meaning . The idea for Planetran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of climate change since his undergraduate astrophysics days , he read " Natural Capitalism , " by Paul Hawken , Amory Lovins , and L. Hunter Lovins . The book 's thesis of the next century as one devoted to the efficient use , not just extraction , of Earth 's resources supercharged him . <p> With his mind on cars , computers , and climate it was n't a big leap to conjure up the idea of a limo company that used today 's hybrid technology . It would be able to exploit a niche in the local transportation market : low mileage and low impact on the earth . He reasoned that people who used his service might pay a little more to feel good about helping the planet . <p> Cabbie resistance <p> Immediately he discovered resistance to the idea of a new limo company in cab-glutted Boston . But he found a receptive ear in next-door Cambridge . <p> " It was something I knew I could feel passionate about as an entrepreneur , " he says . " I wanted to change the world and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take something people do n't think about that has a huge impact on CO2 and climate change - and use capitalist tools to begin changing that . " <p> Planetran was born last summer when he used his savings to buy the first Toyota Prius car and a few months later got his first limo license . To his surprise , the service began immediately to generate business through word of mouth . <p> Three Priuses are part of the Planetran fleet now . Riney says there will be at least three more and , he hopes , a total of 8 to 10 by the time the Democratic convention arrives in Boston this summer . He 's already gotten interest from state delegations that want an environmentally friendly ride to and from the airport . <p> " At the end of the day , I 'm building a transportation company , " he says . " But it 's something that helps the environment that nobody 's ever done before . I think I can change the Boston public auto industry for the better just by doing it - not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Individual religious and ethical concerns are also driving an awakening on the subject . In 1993 , the National Religious Partnership for the Environment was formed in Amherst , Mass. , bringing together the National Council of Churches of Christ , the Evangelical Environmental Network , and the Coalition on the Environment and Jewish Life . <p> Amid that ferment arose the Interfaith Power &; Light initiative , which has swept congregations in 14 states in two years . The California Interfaith Power &; Light chapter includes hundreds of congregations focused on reducing their energy demands to save the planet - and , in the process , maybe their own souls , too . <p> Spiritual message <p> Meeting the threat of " global warming resonates with people at the level of their spiritual relationship to God and the rest of His creation , " says the Rev. Sally Bingham , environmental minister at Grace Cathedral in San Francisco . " It 's fundamentally about loving your neighbor on the other side of the planet . " <p> She 's deeply involved with California Interfaith Power &; Light and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your relationship to God is manifest in the way you treat other people , " she says . " But where it gets difficult is that a lot of people can intellectualize that they love their neighbor - and still drive a gas guzzler or waste energy at home . We 're inviting them to be more connected in a deeper way - to be mindful of one 's behavior . " <p> One Jewish congregation involved in the California program found its answer above - with solar power on the roof . <p> " I think global warming poses a special moral dilemma , " says Rabbi Melanie Aron of Shir Hadash , a congregation in Los Gatos . " It 's a huge problem , and it 's the size of the problem that so often discourages people . ' So what if we decrease our electricity usage by a quarter - what does that do ? ' My response is : ' What if everyone cut their electric use by a quarter ? Well , that would be something . ' " <p> So after much prayer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solar panels on the roof of its temple . In September 2002 , the switch was thrown and 10 kilowatts of juice began to flow . It meets most of the energy needs of the congregation . But it 's also had other effects . <p> " We know it has a trickledown effect as a hands-on example of what parishioners can do in their homes , " Rabbi Aron says . <p> Lately , she 's seen families in the congregation buying hybrid cars and giving up their SUVs . <p> " Global warming is a big issue for families because it 's a terrible thought to leave this for your children , " she says . " It 's reaching people in a deeper way .
