preThe host is riding from KnocknareaAnd over the grave of Clooth-na-Bare ; Caoilte tossing his burning hair , And Niamh calling Away , come away :  --  " The Hosting of the Sidhe , " W. B. Yeats My mother spoke with the dead . After the doctors declared her cancer-free , she could feet and hear their ghosts , see them as clear as day . It was a reprieve , she said , and it was consolation , a constant reminder of what she should not forget and never take for granted . But in the country , the essence , the sense of death was everywhere . It was a fox half-buried in muck at the side of the ditch ; it was a dog floating in the river . It came in the form of disease like mad cow or hoof and mouth or rabies or distemper or encephalitis that left rabbits dead in the road , their faces grotesquely contorted , twisted from the inside out . It was the odor of pig slaughter that drifted over the fields from Paddy Meaney 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyed the remains of carcasses . Death was Gerald Power turned about , sucked in and out of a combine harvester and spraying the field red with bone and gristle . It was Deirdre Malone jumping into the Barrow after the pubs had closed because there was nothing better to do and no promise that things would ever change . Or poor queer Brigid Long who had been found wandering the fields and taken up the country , a place you 'd never want to go , and her babies left all alone without her . That was a kind of death as well . Yet we , my sister and I , never considered the possibility that our mother was dying . <p> She slipped through our lives , a pale specter , like the nightly moonbeams shedding nay curtains . She circled the house with prayer and spoke with the dead . She moaned in the night as she slept as if in pain or struggle . She reached the dark places under the skin that only she knew how to touch , and she held on , rubbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinew and glistening marrow , stretching the tendons of our hearts with unrelenting ache- <p> Her life seemed suddenly muted , and silent , disembodied from the boisterous and loud , belligerent and violent , often bloodied men and women of the family , yet her presence was undeniable . Irrepressible and constant like the river , like the ghosts , the dead , and the Holy Roman Apostolic Catholic Church we lived with , my mother shadowed our daily activities ; in prayer and in silence she held vigil , and in vigil held us in sway with unrelenting guilt . <p> My mother made sure that we attended mass every Sunday , whether she attended or not . She 'd walk with us the four miles into town and wait outside with the men while the service went on . It made the men uncomfortable ; they shuffled their feet , inhaled their cigarettes sharply and coughed loudly ; they were talking men things , and her presence was an intrusion into this world , I suppose . But my mother was beyond caring ; I 'm sure her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between pain and rapture , humor and despair . <p> Howya , Bridie , the men would say in chorus , and I 'd hear her voice , a laughing singsong off Howya , John . By God , Sheamie , you 're looking well . Lookit you , Mulligan , and poor Deirdre in there offering up blessings for your soul , you blaggard . <p> Before Communion we fasted . And during Lent we starved . We attended high mass and low mass and vespers , and on no account could we rush The Stations of The Cross . My sister and I had rosary beads that at a moment 's warning might be required for prayer , on our knees on the cold stone floor in the kitchen , the muck skittering off the bottoms of our Wellingtons if we had just come in from the fields . <p> At twilight , when she went on her walks , she wore a dark green bandanna about her head to cover her thinning black hair ; soft evening mist fell upon the fields and shone upon the fine bones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more translucent and taut each day , as if she were becoming young again . <p> She walked through mucky fields to pay homage at country shrines of the Blessed Mother Mary . More Pagan than Christian in stony appearance , overgrown and abandoned to the Old Gods , they were Shrines of entwined rowan branches and water-pooled dung holes through which eels slipped dream-like . She touched the old stones carefully , reverently , with meaning that was lost to me , and she resembled , coming across the wet fields through the rain , skirt raised and umbrella flapping like wings , half-Pagan herself ; her laughter drifting untethered across the fields and surprising anyone who might come across her , so that she could have been any young-old woman , full of life and with a lull life ahead of her , her expression queerly distant , as if she no longer belonged to this place anymore  --  other voices were calling to her ; a haunting otherworld refrain that my sister and I recognized was spiriting our mother slowly away from us . <p> Ghosts roamed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rock absent of light , and moist to the touch  --  this is where they lived and where you could hear them talking quietly , secretively , beneath the breath of the living . But it seemed only our mother could speak with them . Beneath her voice their responses tremored faintly , reverberated with anomalous vibrations of the past echoing from their time to ours . During the night the echoes of their persistent , incessant footsteps tracked back and forth across the worn linoleum . Even our pillows were damp with the otherworldly touch of their wet kisses , and I imagined them irreverently bent over our beds as we slept , their lips smacking wetly , waiting to hold our hands and embrace us the way they did our changeling mother . <p> The first time she finally trusted us to go to the service without her , my sister and I only made the pretense of doing so . Dressing in our Sunday best  --  or rather , the best that we had , which only meant that our clothes were freshly washed and not threadbare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of sight , we slipped through the fields and spent the next few hours in the woods . When we returned , she was sitting by a roaring fire of coal and bundled up in jumpers against a cold only she could feel , for it was still summer , and warm . She asked us what it seemed she already knew the answer to . <p> Did ye go to mass ? <p> And we could n't lie  --  we knew she knew the truth , and so we told her . We could not understand the pained look in her eyes , how badly we had disappointed her . She nodded and stared back at the flames , sadly and strangely subdued . <p> Cold damp smell of ashes in the black hearth . Rain on the air . A wind sighing down the chimney , and my mother silent in her bedroom again . Molly was at the sink washing dishes , her sleeves rolled up , hands pink and wrinkled from the scalding hot water . I watched her features shimmering in the glass of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . Beyond the angle of her flushed cheeks , gray fields bent , flattened by the wind . <p> Is she all right ? I asked . <p> Molly held her forearm across her brow and sighed . I do n't know , she said . She would n't eat this morning . <p> I went out to the coal shed , but there was nothing there but the cat and her kittens , who looked up sleepily from their warm tea chest of straw in the corner , the littlest ones mewling in their sleep , as wind whistled through the rotting timbers . <p> I stole over to Meaney 's woods and came back with an armful of sodden logs which would not ignite . As the flames licked at them and attempted to take hold , numerous green bugs scrambled from the pockmarked surface and fell hissing into the fire , filling the small living morn with black smoke . I heard the bellowing of cows and looked out the window . The gate at the far end of the field was knocked from its moorings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their emaciated black-spotted shanks swinging from side to side . I cursed and ran out after them . <p> As I drove them back into the pasture , the rain began to fall harder , and I watched from across the fields as a thin tendril of black rope curled from our chimney , swaying this way and that through the wind , like a dark noose . <p> My mother began to cry . Everywhere her tears filed up the vacuous space with its presence . There were long prolonged periods of crying , sullen sobs that echoed throughout the house as my sister and I huddled together upon our bed , waiting for her anguish to wrack and sunder the house with a portentous howl , a keening wail full with the knowledge of the loss and pain to come . But her tears never became loud . And her silence was , in a way , a quiet desperate surrender to events we could no longer control . Our mother was being punished , not for what she had done , but , it seemed , for what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would continue to fail to do . <p> At church she circled the holy water font , unsure whether to dip her hands into the water or not . Like an aged cat sniffing something that has been dead on the road for days and has become corrupt , nay mother seemed uneasy by the gesture of this brief conjugation with God and was resistant to such an embrace . When I asked her why she was hesitant to bless herself with the holy water , she stared at me . Her face was close to mine , and it seemed streaked , as if with rain ; luminous and waxen , sinking around the bones of her red-rimmed eyes , it appeared as if her flesh were slowly giving way . The color of her once bright eyes was dissipated , and the pupils remained undilated in the dim light . Her breath was sour , and her teeth seemed more pronounced when she spoke . <p> I meet God in other places , she whispered . The bandanna was becoming tighter around her scalp . More and more her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she stood outside , the men were forced to look away uncomfortably , throw their cigarettes away in frustration and come into the church stamping the muck off their boots loudly as they passed her , as if she were some cruel shepherd driving them to God . <p> It was an early spring morning ; the chill had left the air , and all kinds of smells were coming up from the warming earth . I held my mother 's hand as we entered the churchyard . When the men saw her coming , they began moving . <p> A bleedin ' Ghoul , John Lawlor muttered , just like me dead wife , but it was at me he glared as he mounted the steps  --  he could not look my mother in the eye . I thought of Mag Lawlor 's gray headstone in the dun field to the right of the church and wondered how or why he would say such a thing : my mother was no Ghoul . But thinking of nay mother alive and Mag Lawlor dead and the difference between the two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the worms and the muck , made me hold my mother 's hand all the more tightly . <p> The gathering of men lounging outside of the church dwindled as more and more of them sat with their suspicious wives during the mass , counting the minutes of the service until the pubs opened , watching the shit slowly melt off their Wellingtons , and silently cursing , instead of praying for , our mother . <p> She sat in the pews at the back of the church silently , mouthing words to prayers that were different than our own , listening , perhaps , to the silence , in expectation of something to come , something not yet realized , but something that she was very much aware would be . Her demeanor was one of confidence and sublime calm , Often she went to the church alone , when there were no priests and no parishioners , and sat amongst the candles lit for the souls of the dead . Her coins clattered in the tin , and then she lit her own . She never received Holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responses , somehow surprised and startled from her peaceful reverie . Yet , on the long walk home through the fields , avoiding the roads , she 'd laugh as she picked herbs and plants for seasoning the late supper . <p> It was Sunday again , and she had stayed home , sullenly staring into the fire . The men could swear and smoke as they liked outside the church . My sister and I lit candles for her , offered up separate prayers and were grateful when Uncle Oweny picked us up on the long road coming from mass . His wife had run off , taken the night boat from Rosslare to England with an American doctor  --  he knew she would be back , this was the third time , and she always came back , but he was n't good at the cooking , and he knew there was always good food to be had of a Sunday when people had to be Christian and charitable . <p> Oweny looked about the kitchen table , pushed buttered potatoes and bread into his mouth , chewed vigorously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T is some fair weather we 've been havin ' , he said , and nodded enthusiastically . <p> Jay , that 's fine tay there , he grinned at my sister and me , and my sister , smiling sheepishly , rose to bring him the pot that was steeping on the grill . <p> Are you a hand at readin ' the leaves yet , Maire ? he asked . <p> My sister shook her head as she poured the tea . Only Mammy , she said . <p> Oweny nodded , food bulged in his cheeks , he gulped the tea . His bushy head moved up and down and from side to side . His boot thumped the floor to the music on the wireless . <p> Bridie , you 're lookin ' awful tired , so . <p> I am awful tired , Owen . <p> You 've not et ? <p> I 'm not hungry . <p> My mother placed her elbow upon the table and rested her cheek in her hand . Outside a soft rain spilled through the sun , and in dazzling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , I could make out three interlinked rainbows sharpening in color over Ross . There could have been countless more , receding as far as the eye could see , linked like dreams all the way from the valley to Ben Mor in the east . I thought of my mother 's moods , which seemed to move with the weather and the tides and the moon until there was no discovering where she was or where she would be . <p> I 'll go out on the river this weekend , bring you back a fine pair of salmon . That 'll get the color back in you . <p> Our knives and forks scraped on our plates . The room grew warm from the cooker . My mother 's eyes fluttered closed , her breathing deepened . It was as if she were asleep . This happened sometimes when she was in pain . <p> An Diabhal , Bridget , sure what 's wrong with you ? Oweny asked . He stopped chewing , his knife and fork poised in his hands as if he were ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way that she sometimes did , and it was startling , as if she were somewhere very far away but had only to hear you and she could answer if she wanted . I thought it powerful that she had a choice in the matter . It was a strange and unsettling vacillation between the mother we knew and the stranger that , more and more , occupied her place with huge mood swings that could move her to tears in one minute and laughter in the next . Her eyes opened , and they were bright with pain . She reached for her cup of soup , wrapped her shaking fingers tightly around it . <p> Is it the sickness again ? he asked . Sure , what have the doctors- <p> Fuck the doctors ! What do the doctors know of anything ! nay mother shouted , slamming her mug upon the table with such force it cracked . Ceramic splinters scattered across the table . Hot soup splattered on the cement floor . My mother 's body shook with energy , the tendons in her forearms and neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made her seem even more gaunt , more emaciated , than I had previously perceived . Slowly , her strength ebbed ; she sank back into the chair . My sister scooped up the broken shards of mug with the broom and dust pan . I poured nay mother another cup of soup and placed it before her , more out of the need to do something than just sit there and gawk at her and because there was nothing else I felt I could do . The radio seemed loud in the quiet that followed . Oweny nibbled at his food , his body stilled of activity , until he could hear the silence no more . <p> Aye , sure the salmon is just the thing . You 'll see . The wonders a salmon can do now , by God , you 'll see . <p> My mother clutched at her soup as if she were losing her hold on everything tangible and real about her , and nothing we did could convince her otherwise . Sometimes it was difficult to even touch her  --  she either did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew she would come , and she would go , until finally there would be nothing of her left , and she would stay gone , but for now , I could only try to hold on to those moments when she was our mother and she was with us . <p> The bands of color were dissipating , becoming pale and washed out over Ross . The sun was out , and the rain clouds had moved east . The fields were so green and bright and beautiful I had to close nay eyes from crying with the pain of them . <p> On Fridays during Lent she made sure we ate fish , that we blessed ourselves before every meal and as we passed before every church ; during confession she waited outside the confessional , counting the minutes of our sins , and then the minutes of our contrition . Before confession we prayed for guidance so that we might disclose all of our sins to the darkly hidden , vulpine shadow within . And she waited for us , as the final leveler of due soul-wage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Again and again Father O'Brien would come out to talk to her , but she would already be leading us by the hand , genuflecting before the Eucharist , and then walking swiftly up the aisle , her heels and her voice echoing , trailing in lilting farewell , and filling up the vastness of the church 's high vaulted ceilings with her presence . <p> Ah , now , sure , was n't that awful quick , she 'd say once we were outside . Are ye sure you told him everything ? I certainly did . <p> How many Hail Marys did he give ye , then ? <p> Four . <p> And Our Fathers ? <p> Four , <p> And what else ? <p> Nothing else . <p> Are ye lying , because I 'll know if you 're lying . <p> I 'm not lying , I swear to Jesus I 'm not lying . <p> There 's no need to be swearing to Jesus like that , you 'd have a good mind to go back in there to Father O'Brien this very minute . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll be needing at all . <p> I blessed myself , rolled my eyes heavenward , pushed my face into a look of penitence and , I hoped , contrition , or what I imagined contrition looked like , the look on all the adults I 'd seen leaving the confessional . She squeezed my hand and laughed . <p> <p> By God , I do n't know what the world 's coming to , then . Ye never got out of the holy church with that in nay day . <p> Father O'Brien was a plump , well-fed , little man from Cork , with full cheeks and a flushed face  --  I often imagined him at the altar or in the confessional , wondering what the maid had prepared for his supper and the progress of the Cork match that would be playing on the color television in the presbytery after the mass on a Sunday . He had receding red hair and heavily hooded eyes with pale eyelashes that gave the impression that he was somehow not interested or imaginative , that he was tired or bored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on in contemplation , as if they were sweets , before he spoke or considered his next words , although , in truth , it hardly ever seemed he considered much . <p> Brigid , he called , Brigid . We must talk before it is too late ! as my mother fled , gleefully , happily , up the sacrosanct aisle . His voice was strong and rose to a high pitch at the end , giving it a sense of authorial despair , like a parent scolding a child . He wanted her confession , wanted desperately for my mother to confess what he must have believed were dark and exciting , incredibly impassioned sins . He wanted everyone to recognize that she was a sinner who , unless she confessed and received absolution , would never know salvation . The whole parish knew this , and it seemed to drive him to a passion that she relented , that she laughed at his requests . She would never give it to him , she said , not even on her deathbed . God could take her , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit , if God would take her at all . <p> Clouds raced towards Ross , and when I stared out the window across the fields , I could see the first twinkling of lights from the town as the sky darkened like ash . Smoke curled up from the chimney and seemed to tether the gloom above us . <p> In the silence of twilight my sister and I shed our skins , and thus poised uncertainly at that in-between moment  --  in between life and death  --  we waited in the silence for the voices of the dead to emerge : the Angelus has sounded , and the test screen of the Madonna halts the supper ; the potatoes are boiling , steam filling the kitchen , and the living room smells of damp animal hair and the smoke of the fire ; we unconsciously test our breaths with the air around us , hold them as the moon rises and dew shines on the darkening fields like niter ; with cows lowing to be milked and eejit dogs baying and the turf and the logs hissing and splitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , our mother moves farther and farther away from us , towards the voices we have waited for , but only she can hear . <p> You were sleepwalking again , my mother said in the morning . Her eyes were wide and unblinking , but I did n't think she was seeing me at all . Her voice sounded as if she were speaking from a dream . <p> Rashers were spitting on the grill . The heady odor of strong tea filled the kitchen . The walls and windows were covered in condensation ; beads of moisture reached up into the corners of the ceiling where the plaster had darkened with rot . <p> I woke with the moon beaming through the curtains , she said , it was filling up my whole room like a great pale eye peering in on me , so I got up and looked out the window , and there you were , walking across the field , down by the woods , towards the marsh . <p> She glanced towards the dark corners of the ceiling and hesitated . Her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electric lights in the house had been turned off so that she could see property , and it seemed she was always waiting , longing for the natural gray of twilight to descend with the promise of night . <p> I kept losing you between the trees , she continued , you were like a ghost , and at first I thought you were a ghost , but then I says to myself , Sure , do n't be daft , is n't it only Michael , and it was you , and I just sat there and watched and waited for you to come back in because that 's what the doctors say ; leave a sleepwalking person alone and eventually they 'll wake up , and she nodded , pleased with herself . <p> You passed right below my window , she said , and before you came in , you looked up , stared straight at me , and for a moment I was scared again because I thought , It does n't really look like you at all , and the eyes they went right through me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clouds shifted before the moon , one of Hennessey 's dogs bayed , and everything was right again . It was you , as you had been , and it must have been a queer trick of the moonlight for me to think anything else . <p> She shook her head and smiled , a gentle , thoughtful purse of her full yet blanched lips that made me want to reach out and shake her from her dream , and bring her back to us  --  I missed that smile , and it should have been for us . <p> I almost had to laugh at me own silliness , she said , and then you came in so , climbed the stairs and fell into bed . And straight to sleep . It 's strange so , how it is that you sleepwalk like that . And that I could have thought you were someone other than yourself . Strange . <p> And then she stared through us , pale eyes , pinpricks for pupils , glistening from the dark hollows of her face . Veins showed prominently through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deteriorating , crumbling rock . She was no more than a shade of herself , no more than a presence of pale shimmering skin at the table , like an incandescent moonbeam without substance , yet even that presence continued to fill up everything that we knew or recognized that was still our mother . <p> My sister and I looked at one another ; we chewed our toast quietly , supped our tea , and then my sister rose and quickly cleared the table of dishes . She turned on the tap and bent over the sink , her shoulders rounded and trembling , the sound of running water filling the silence . <p> I have to feed the dogs , I said , and went to the door while my mother stared at her tea leaves . But in the hallway I leant against the cold wall , closed my eyes , and cried . <p> I did not sleepwalk , and neither did nay sister . In fact , it was us who woke each night to watch that ghost tread back and forth across the moonlit fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our house every night , track muck , and twigs , and shit across the carpet , climb up the stairs to its bed into which it clambered with barely a sound , but the slightly reverberating dissonance of its sobs carried on the cold still air of the house . We watched and we prayed because the ghost that roamed the countryside every night , trailing the dark , fog-shrouded fields , searching , looking for something that in the light of day was lost and forgotten , and who seemed to have no recollection of it , was our mother . <p> The days grew shorter , and twilight came more and more quickly , darkening the fields . My mother 's once plump but diminutive body faded . She moved about us every day with less weight and with less substance , and hung on the air at the edges of our lips like a prayer . At every opportunity we could see how the dead occupied her thoughts and all the spaces of what had been living ; I could see how they possessed , took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becoming something else , someone else 's  --  no longer ours . And so I looked over my shoulder as I climbed the stairs , when I went out into the dark to the outhouse or to the coal shed ; I searched the fields anxiously ; I paused on the landing , holding nay breath , waiting for a movement , a shimmer of light , a presence to betray itself , and , waiting to exhale , I searched my features in the mirror to see it ghosts moved across nay face . I tried to fool my shadow as I walked and shake loose any clinging specter ; I knew they were clever  --  although my sister seemed oblivious to their presence . <p> What 's the matter with you ? What are you listening for ? What do you hear ? she persisted , panicked , as if there were something there , beyond the silence , at the edge of darkness , that she could not hear  --  a chord , a tremor of music ; a haunting , hypnotic chorus calling from a world away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of our mother . <p> Ghosts , I whispered . And Molly rolled her eyes , Jaysus . But what I saw when my sister stared back was not a mirror image of myself , nor of her , but rather a shadow of something darker , beyond church and prayer and God , something that moved beyond both our senses and called silently to our mother in the late night , enticing and enrapturing her to walk the frozen fields and , hand in hand with that other , empty her heart of all its dreams . <p> <p> By Thomas O'Malley <p>
