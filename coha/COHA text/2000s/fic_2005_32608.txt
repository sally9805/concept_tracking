Ginevra and Scott Ginevra King was the eldest of the three daughters of Charles Garfield King , a wealthy Chicago stockbroker , and Ginevra Fuller King , his wife . There was money on both sides of the family , earned by Ginevra 's grandfathers , both of whom were self-made men . Her paternal grandfather , Charles Bohan King , had come to Chicago from upstate New York in 1863 . At first he worked as a wholesale grocer , then as a jobber in hats , caps , and furs . He eventually moved into banking and prospered , retiring in 1885 as president of the Commercial Safe Deposit Co . He was a Republican and a Presbyterian ; he sent his older son , Rockwell King , to Harvard and his younger son ( Ginevra 's father ) to Yale . Ginevra 's maternal grandfather , William Alden Fuller , was a native of Massachusetts . He began his working life in 1852 as a station agent for the Worcester &; Nashua Railroad ; in 1854 he came to Chicago and entered the lumber trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Potter Palmer , the dry goods magnate , he struck out as a dealer in building materials . He formed the corporation of Palmer , Fuller &; Co. ; the business was a success , and he became wealthy during the commercial boom that followed the Civil War . He belonged to the Episcopal Church and the Union League . Ginevra , as a teenager , knew him as a widower who lived in a large house at 2913 Michigan Avenue . Ginevra 's mother and father had married in January 1898 , four years after he had taken his degree at Yale . When he wed Ginevra Fuller , Charles King was still a mortgage banker at Shanklin &; King , a business backed by his father 's money , but in 1900 , when Ginevra turned two , he beganworking on the side as a stockbroker . In 1906 he became a full-time broker , organizing the firm of King , Farnum &; Co. , of which he was senior member . The brokerage prospered , operating from seats on both the Chicago and the New York exchanges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her father in the house on Michigan Avenue when Ginevra met Scott , but Charles King had already acquired a large summer residence ( which he called " Kingdom Come Farm " ) in Lake Forest , and he was building an elegant four-story mansion in the city at the corner of Astor and Burton . Charles King and his wife belonged to Onwentsia , an exclusive country club in Lake Forest , where he played golf and polo . He built his own string of polo ponies , which he stabled on his Lake Forest property , and he played for the club in competitions against other teams during the 1890s and early 1900s . The Kings socialized with the other prominent families in Chicagothe Swifts , Armours , Cudahys , Palmers , McCormicks , and Chatfield-Taylors . The children of these families went to schools and churches together and played with one another in Lake Forest during the summers . Their parents sent them to fashionable New England prep schools ; the sons usually stayed in the East to attend Harvard or Yale . This was a tightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , property , shared values , and high social status . The Chicago of the early twentieth century , their Chicago , had been defined by three important events in the last third of the nineteenth century : the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 , the Haymarket Square Bombing of 1886 , and the World 's Columbian Exposition of 1893 . The fire had destroyed the old city , a prosperous but poorly laid-out center of railroading , meatpacking , and shipping , and had given Chicago 's entrepreneurs an opportunity to erect a modern metropolis , with a transportation loop and with some of the world 's first skyscrapers . The Haymarket Square Bombing and the riots that followed had set unions and laborers against capitalists in bitter conflicts that lasted well into the twentieth century . Most of the workers were immigrants ( many were Irish ) , and virtually all of them belonged to the Catholic Church , which was thought to have fomented much of the labor agitation . The Columbian Exposition with its famous " White City " a collection of fanciful , alabaster-colored buildings covering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had arrived . The exposition featured an Electricity Building , a Ferris wheel , a reproduction of one of Columbus 's ships , a prototype of the movie projector , and a sixty-foot cannon that could fire a shell over sixteen miles . More than twenty-seven million people came to Chicago to visit this exposition ; most of them went away convinced that the city was a wonderful example of American hustle , ambition , and commercial power . This was the city in which Ginevra King 's family , and other families of the Chicago haute bourgeoisie , were prospering . Ginevra was the third woman in her family to bear that given name. * Like her mother and grandmother , she was named for Ginevra de Benci , the pensive young Florentine noblewoman of Leonardo da Vinci 's famous portrait , painted in 1474 and familiar to nineteenth-century art students and connoisseurs from etchings and oil reproductions . Ginevra King had a clear sense of her family 's wealth and position and , from an early age , a highly developed understanding of how social status worked . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could probably only be managed by a group of pretty fifteen-year-old girls , Ginevra and three of her friends had declared themselves to be the " Big Four " the four most attractive and socially desirable young women in Chicago . They had not consulted anyone about this ; they had simply anointed themselves . The other three girls were Edith Cummings , Courtney Letts , and Margaret ( " Peg " ) Carry . The girls had four identical pinky rings made of rose gold ; engraved inside each ring , in script letters , was " The Big Four 1914 . " ( Ginevra 's ring can be seen on her right hand , next to a signet ring , in the frontispiece of this book . ) The girls went to dances and house parties together , and they were seen as a foursome on the golf links and tennis courts at Onwentsia . If other girls were jealous , Ginevra and her three friends did not care . The Big Four was complete ; it would admit no further members . Ginevra herself was lovely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height , with refined features and a good profile . She had a slim figure , pretty legs and ankles , and small , graceful hands . Her hair was dark and curly ; her eyes , deep brown in color , were lively and sparkling . Ginevra 's voice was her most unusual attributelow and expressive , with a slight roughness of texture . She liked to sing and laugh : if something truly amused her she would produce a snort . She loved parties , adored dancing , and was adept in social situations , relying on her looks and instincts to see her through . Ginevra 's diary reveals other things about her . She was intensely competitive and did not like to lose at anythinggolf , tennis , or even basketball ( for which she was undersized ) . She loved athletics and was a good enough golfer to hold her own against Edith Cummings , who later won two national titles in the sport . Ginevra was reasonably diligent about her schoolwork but was n't terribly interested in it . She preferred athletics and parties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends . She was direct in speech and self-confident in behavior ; there was little that was studied or calculated about what she did or said . She was not especially interested in discussing the shortcomings of others and was not much inclined toward introspection or self-analysis . When Scott Fitzgerald met her , Ginevra was halfway through her sophomore year at Westover School in Middlebury , Connecticut . Westover , a country boarding school , was a relatively new institution . It had been founded in 1910 by Miss Mary Robbins Hillard and her associate Miss Theodate Pope . Miss Hillard had taught from 188591 at Miss Porter 's School in Farmington , Connecticut ( where Miss Pope had been her student ) , and had been principal of St. Margaret 's in Waterbury for the eighteen years following . Westover was a small , exclusive finishing school : about 150 girls were enrolled , and their training was focused on languages , literature , history , art , and music . Occasionally Miss Hillard would read aloud from the newspaper to the girls at assembly , but otherwise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the forty or so graduates each year went on to college . Most of the girls were destined to be the wives of wealthy men ; they would find fulfillment in social activities , in child-rearing , and , if they wished to , in helping the needy . This was a point much stressed at Westover ; the girls were given a strong sense of social responsibility and American-style noblesse oblige . Accommodations at Westover were relatively spartan ; the emphasis was on character-building . The girls were required to take daily exercise , either in sports or in " jogging , " a rapid trotting that was encouraged in the afternoons . Westover had no religious affiliation ; most of the students belonged to Protestant denominations and attended churches in Middlebury . Much energy went into singing , plays , picnics , and single-sex dances , which were called " Germans " and were held each Saturday night . Girls attended these dances as couples ; crushes between younger and older girls were common . The dormitory rooms were large and commodious . Maids ( all from Trinidad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housekeeping chores . Girls often spent the night with one another and stayed awake after lights-out to gossip and talk . Uniforms were required : a khaki skirt with a black patent-leather belt and a white blouse during the day ; a white dress with black silk stockings and low-heeled shoes in the evenings . For sports the girls wore black alpaca bloomers , thick black stockings , and Peter Pan blouses . On the coldest days , corduroy deerstalker hats were issued , with flaps to keep one 's ears warm . As for cosmetics , only a little face powder was permittedno lip rouge . Ginevra did not much like Westover . She was not truly unhappy there , but the close supervision of her academic performance and her behavior seems to have rankled her . She had no special aspirations to excel in her classes ; she studied with fair diligence and maintained a B average , but much of the assigned work bored her . The fun outside classes at Westover was not really to her taste . She would have preferred more opportunities to see other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and amusements . Ginevra had a disobedient streak : she had managed to get herself crosswise with Miss Hillard , who criticized her behavior and summoned her to the office from time to time for lectures on deportment . It 's likely that Ginevra , who was as strong-willed as Miss Hillard , rather enjoyed testing the school rules and getting under the skin of its headmistress . Perhaps she told these things to Scott Fitzgerald on the night she met him . F. Scott Fitzgerald was the only son of Edward Fitzgerald , a marginally successful wholesale grocery salesman in St. Paul , and Mollie McQuillan Fitzgerald , his wife . There was money in Scott 's family , but only on his mother 's side and only in the previous generation . Mollie 's father , Philip F. McQuillan , had immigrated to America in 1843 , at the age of nine , from County Fermanagh in Ireland . He and his parents had settled in Galena , Illinois . His success story resembles the " up-by-the-bootstraps " stories of Ginevra 's grandfathers . At the age of twenty-three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a bookkeeper with Beaupre &; Temple , a wholesale grocery house . In 1858 he ventured out on his own in the same business and prospered in the years following the Civil War . Philip McQuillan merged his firm with that of his former employer in 1875 to form McQuillan , Beaupre &; Co . Philip was an energetic man with considerable business acumen . He became a respected citizen of St. Paul ( a member of the " lace-curtain " Irish , not the " pig-in-the-parlor " Irish ) and a generous benefactor of the local Catholic church . Philip , however , contracted Bright 's disease in his late thirties and died in 1878 at the age of forty-four . He left an estate of more than $266,000a substantial amount at the time . It was enough to support his widow , Louisa McQuillan , for the rest of her life and to keep their children in relative comfort , even as adults . The money , however , did not beget more money as it had in Ginevra 's family . The five surviving McQuillan children seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate . Mollie , the eldest daughter , married Edward Fitzgerald in 1890 . Edward was a small , dapper man who had moved to St. Paul in the mid-1870s from Rockville , Maryland . He too was a Catholic , though not a devout one . He was descended from Maryland ancestors who had settled in the colony sometime during the seventeenth century . Edward was a " well-bred " man with excellent Southern manners , but he was short on ambition and business savvy . Certainly there were opportunities in St. Paul for him to be successful . The city , situated at the navigational head of the Mississippi River , was a prosperous center of commerce , manufacturing , banking , railroading , and insurance . As the state capital , St. Paul boasted handsome government buildings and large hotels , impressive museums and restaurants and theaters . The chief drawback to life there was the frigid winter weather , though St. Paul residents made the most of it , building ice palaces and organizing winter carnivals to break up the monotony of the long cold season . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Edward Fitzgerald organized the American Rattan &; Willow Works , which manufactured wicker furniture . This business ( ill-suited , one would think , to the Minnesota climate ) failed in 1898 . Edward moved with his family to Buffalo , New York , where he took a job as a salesman for Procter &; Gamble . He was transferred by the company to Syracuse in 1900 , then back to Buffalo in 1903 ; but in 1908 , at the age of fifty-five , he was cut loose permanently and had to return to St. Paul . There he earned a small livelihood as a wholesale grocery salesman , working from a desk in his brother-in-law 's real estate firm , making a little money on his own but relying for support primarily on his wife 's family . As a boy Scott often heard his mother say , " If it were n't for your Grandfather McQuillan , where would we be now ? " Mollie McQuillan Fitzgerald was a mildly eccentric woman who doted on her son . Her first two children , both daughters , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1896 , and she had focused much attention on him when he was young . He had been named Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald after the author of " The Star-Spangled Banner , " who was a distant relative on his father 's side . Scott was a beautiful boy , with blond hair and arrestingly bright blue-green eyes . He excelled in school plays and at local dramatics , and he showed some literary ability in his early teens , but he was a mediocre athlete and a thoroughly indifferent student .
