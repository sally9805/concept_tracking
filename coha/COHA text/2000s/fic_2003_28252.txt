1 . THE FISHERMAN Gravesend Bay , New York , August 22 , 1776 He had sat out the raw misery of the storm through most of the night , keeping his boat tight against the shore . She was pulled up on soft ground between two large rocks , his private mooring , a hiding place he had known since he was a boy . The boat would be safe there , from weather or the occasional vandal , but this time the storm was different , the rain driven by a howling wind that might push the waves hard beneath the boat , damaging her against the rocks . His wife would not worry , would keep the fireplace lit , would not protest even though he would stay out all night . She had heard him speak of it too often , his love of the water , the pursuit of the fish that seemed to call to him in a way few wives understand . This time she did not expect him to return home for at least two days , and so as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amazing violence of the storm , he did not worry for her , thought only of tomorrow , the new dawn , hoping that the storm would be gone . He would rarely fish in the darkness , but the late summer had been hot , breathless days that kept the fish silent , sent them away to some invisible place every fisherman seeks . He had thought of drift- ing with the tide along the edge of Gravesend Bay , without even his small sail , just easing along the first deep water offshore , hoping to tempt something from below into an ill-timed assault on his handmade hooks . But as the sun went down , the breeze had not calmed , and he had stared wide-eyed at a terrifying burst of lightning , warning him from the distance , a great show from the lower tip of New York , moving toward him from the distantshores of New Jersey . The storm had blown hard across the harbor , and he barely made it to his private wharf before the hard rain slapped his face and soaked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to slide the boat between the rocks , jumping out and then moving quickly under the ledges that faced away from the water . There was nowhere else to go , no thought of a fire , no blessed coffee , nothing but the hard crack of thunder . He had tried to lift himself up , keep his breeches off the ground , the dirt beneath him turning to mud as the flow of rainwater found him , small rivers in the soil . But the rock ledge was low and tight , and he could not escape , had settled into the misery , simply to wait it out until the dawn . Before first light , the rain had stopped , and the quiet had awakened him . He groaned his way into the open air , his joints crying in stiffness , the air chilling him through the wetness of his shirt . But then he could see the first glow in the east , and he listened for the sound , the winds gone , only a soft breeze flowing through the trees behind him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fish would move , emerging from their own shelter , hungry , looking for whatever he might offer them . It was a lesson taught him by his father , who had fished this same water , who knew Gravesend Bay better than anyone in the villages , the way a farmer knows his land , every rock , every hole . He had begun to go out with his father when he was barely old enough to hold the stout fishing pole , had cheered with pure joy when the old man had wrestled with the fury of some unknown creature , and shared the pride of his father 's success , the fish flopping and writhing in the bottom of the boat , the old man 's quiet joy . His father was gone now , but the lessons remained . He looked at the boat , his father 's boat , cared for by the hand of the son , thought , It 's time to go fishing . There was a great deal of water in the boat , and he scooped out as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great splash on muddy ground , the last bit of water spilling away . He was in a hurry now , did not look at the glow on the horizon , knew that the dawn would give way to another hot day , and he slid the boat quickly off the shore , one last push as he waded out beside it , then jumped , lifting himself into the stern . He pushed with the long pole , the boat cutting through the low ripples on the water , and he measured the shallowness , knew that in another hundred yards it would drop off . He examined his fishing pole , felt the familiar excitement , knew that in the early morning , he might find a big one , a striped bass perhaps , or hook into a big blue , a fight that could pull his boat for a half mile into the great bay . If the breeze was right , he could drift along the slope of the drop-off , where the flounder might strike , the amazingly ugly fish that his wife would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push pole suddenly went deep , the bottom falling away , and he set it down along the rail of the boat , tested the wind , thought of raising the small sail . He reached for the hard wad of bait in his pocket , ignored the smell , picked up the fishing pole . . . then froze , stared hard to the south , across the narrows , saw a reflection , caught by the first sunlight . It was a ship , fat and heavy , in full sail , coming straight toward him . Beyond , he could see two more , smaller frigates , more sails , and he stared at the bows of each ship , cutting through the water , thought , They will turn soon . They must be going out to sea . He had often thought of sailors , the crews who manned the great ships , what kind of life could be had living only on the water . The harbor had filled with them only weeks before , more ships than he thought there were in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to life . They were still there , a forest of bare masts and rigging , wrapping along the shoreline and wharves of Staten Island , extending out into the harbor . They had stayed at anchor for the most part , the navy-knowing as did the villagers-that on Governor 's Island there were cannon , a curious battery placed by the rebels to keep Lord Howe 's ships from sailing close to New York . The villagers had mostly laughed at the idea , that these men who had come down from Boston would dare to threaten His Majesty 's navy , would have the arrogance to believe they could keep the mighty ships in their anchorage . But there had been no conflict , no real activity on either side . The hot talk in the taverns had grown quiet , the inaction breeding boredom in those who never really knew what would happen anyway . He was among them , excited when the navy arrived , the amazing sight of so many troops making camp on Staten Island , a vast sea of tents . But then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their routine . And so , he had once again returned to Gravesend Bay to pursue the fish . His father had told him about the British navy , the mightiest armada in the world , the vast power of the king that kept all his enemies at bay . But his father had no fire for politics , and the son knew only the talk , words like Whig and Tory , and issues that excited some , but , to many more like him , seemed very far away . He had heard the arguments , the complaints and protests , the threats and hot talk that meant very little to him . He had thought it strange that so many people could make such protest against their king , especially in the face of all those ships , the vast army , the enormous guns . And yet the voices had grown louder , the protests erupting into great public gatherings . He had been in New York when this man Washington had come . He had seen what those people called an army , heard some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congress and independence . He thought it odd that the people wanted to be rid of their king , the one man responsible for their security , for protecting them from what he supposed to be all manner of enemies : Indians , the French , even pirates , who could sail close to these very shores , attacking the helpless , stealing anything they pleased . He had never actually seen a pirate , of course , or a Frenchman . There were Indians occasionally , in New York , or so he had heard . He admired these ships , this great mass of power , had felt as so many had felt out there on Long Island , that there could be no danger , no enemy who could harm the colonials as long as the great ships were there to protect them . But the rebels had cannon too . All it meant to him was that he should probably not fish around Governor 's Island . He had not fished around Staten Island either . It was unfamiliar water , too long a trip for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , or a storm blew up , he would be helpless , have to make for land in a place where rumors sprouted . There had been talk from men who had been to Staten Island , who had seen the foreigners . He did n't know why they would be with the king 's army , but the men at the tavern swore they had seen them . They were called Hessians , and some said they were savages , frightening men , strange uniforms and stranger faces . He had laughed at the descriptions , knew some of the men could spin a good yarn , but still . . . why would the king bring these men to New York ? He watched the three ships , his hands moving automatically to rig up his fishing pole . He had often seen smaller ships moving past Gravesend Bay , some near the shallows where he fished . There were sails only when they were heading for the open water , or , as he had seen lately , when they came in , the end of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often called out to him , men up in the rigging , on the rails . He had always waved politely , wondered if they envied him , captain and crew of his own boat . But then someone had shot at him , a puff of smoke from a lookout , the strange zip of the musket ball passing overhead , a small punch in the water behind his boat . He had not understood that , thought it a ridiculous , frightening mistake , but the lesson was learned . Now , when the navy ships moved past he made ready , turned his boat toward the shore , an instinct inside him to move to safety , to keep his fat rocks in sight . He thought now of doing the same , the three ships still bearing toward him . It was odd , something wrong . He did not move , still watched them , thought , They should be turning about before now , the deeper water is behind them . If they keep on this course , they will run aground . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The larger ship was now barely two hundred yards away , then he heard shouts , the ship beginning to veer slowly to one side . The sails began to drop , the rigging alive with men , sounds of canvas flapping , the rattle of chain . He could see the anchor suddenly dropping , a hard splash as it thrust downward . He set the fishing pole down , his heart racing cold in his chest , his hands feeling for the paddle , no time to put up the sail . In short moments , the rigging of the great ship was bare , the tall masts naked against the glow from the east . He began to move the paddle in the water , pulling his boat backward , unable to take his eyes away from the flank of the ship , the rows of cannon staring straight toward him , toward the land behind him . The other ships moved in behind , slow maneuvering , more sails disappearing , and he kept paddling , his boat barely pushing into the tide , the breeze against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocks , the sanctuary , the agonizing distance , moved the paddle faster , chopping at the water . He expected to hear the musket ball again , but they seemed not to notice him , or better , they were ignoring him . The sandy bottom was visible beneath his boat now , and he grabbed quickly for the push pole , stood , balanced precariously , the boat rocking under his feet . He strained against the push pole , the boat lurching under him , but then he stopped . Beyond the smaller ships there was something new , motion again , but different , no sails , no great masts . He stepped up on his seat , tried to see more detail , could tell the boats were flat , the motion coming from rows of oars . He saw more of them , and slowly they reached the warships , but did not stop , kept moving , still coming toward him . He was frozen for a long moment , his mind absorbing through his confusion . The flatboats kept coming , a vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He began to see reflections , a mass of color , red and white and silver . And now he understood . The boats were filled with soldiers . He had reached the rocks , pulled the boat between them , slid it hard onto the shore with sweating hands . The soldiers had ignored him , and he thought of leaving , running the long trail back to his house , telling his wife . He climbed up on the taller rock , could see a great fleet of small flat barges . They had begun to reach the shore , sliding to a stop a hundred yards away from his perch , one after another , shouts , the men suddenly emerging , each boat emptying . He felt a strange thrill , saw the uniforms clearly now , the red and white of the British soldiers , the colors that inspired an empire . He was truly excited , the fear gone , made a small laugh , thought , No , there is no danger . I should go out , salute them , welcome them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red , gold trim , officers . If I can find the commander , bring him to my house . . . He tried to imagine his wife 's face . He laughed again , saw now that the empty boats were moving offshore , sliding between those that still held their passengers . He tried to count , three dozen , No . . . my God . The flotilla stretched all the way past the warships still , an endless sea of flat motion . He could hear sounds now , over the quick shouts of men , the rhythm of drums , and a strange screeching noise . The sounds began to come together , the music of bagpipes , and the boat released its cargo , a different red , men in tartan , and he stared , thought , By God . . . they 're wearin ' . . . skirts . He pictured his wife , knew she would n't believe him , thought of running again , bringing her back here , to see this amazing sight . He wanted to stand up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but something held him down , frozen . There was a ripple of sound behind him , from the sandy hills , a line of thin woods . The soldiers seemed not to hear , no change in their voices , their activity . But he turned , looked back , saw bits of smoke in the trees . Musket fire . He could n't see who was shooting , thought , My God , what foolishness . Who dares to fire at the king 's troops ? He huddled down against the rock , peered out toward the soldiers again , saw men in line , moving off the narrow beach , an officer leading them up the rise toward the trees . The musket fire slowed , just the single pop , then another . Then the woods were quiet , the British troops moving up closer . He felt an odd twist in his stomach , thought , Was that a battle ? Was it over ? He was amazed , thought , You do not shoot at soldiers . He tried to think who it might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the East River , to build some kind of fort near Brooklyn . Is that who was in the woods ? He was anxious to move away now , to go home , to tell his wife this strange story . He looked out toward the boats again , could suddenly hear music , different , brass and drums . One of the boats reached the shore closer to him , and the colors were not red . The sunlight reflected off a mass of metal , men with gold helmets . The uniforms were blue , and the men began to move onto the shore with crisp steps , forming a neat rectangle . He stared , saw they nearly all wore their hair tied in a long queue , a braid protruding from the helmets , each man with a moustache . There were officers here too , and when their men moved off the shore , the officers turned , looked toward him , one man motioning with his arm , pointing . He felt the cold in his chest again , began to back down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to see , peeked up over the edge , saw six of the blue uniforms moving down the beach in his direction . Now the welcome was erased from his mind . He could hear their voices now , words that he did n't understand . This must be . . . could they be . . . Hessians ? He dropped down from the rocks , fought the urge to run , glanced at his boat . No , I can not just leave her here . They might take her . He felt his hands shaking , the strange voices moving closer , just beyond the far side of the big rocks . He took a deep breath , fixed a smile on his face , moved around the boat , saw them now , saw for the first time the long muskets , the hard sharp steel , the bayonets moving down , pointing at him . There was one in a different uniform , the man holding a sword , who motioned toward him , unsmiling , said , " A spy , yes ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , no , sir . Just fishing . " He pointed toward the boat , his hand shaking . " See ? Just fishing , sir . " The officer glanced at the boat , said something to the soldiers beside him , and the men moved quickly , the bayonets suddenly coming forward , the sharp flash of steel , the work of men who know their business . The officer gave a short command , and the soldiers backed away , stood again in a tight line . The officer glanced down at the man who lay fallen into his boat , nodded , made a brief smile . " A spy . Yes . " From the Hardcover edition .
