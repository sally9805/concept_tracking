Chapter One RedDiaryornament1.jpg " You 're empty . Let me get you another . " His fingers covered hers on the stem of the wineglass . She let go , leaving it in his possession . " No thanks . I have to drive . " Chad tilted his head and flashed a perfect pickup smile . The blond , tan lifeguard was God 's gift to women , but his gaze held a hint of used car salesman , and his touch felt too familiar . " I 'd be happy to take you home . What are you drinking ? " Now that Lauren thought about it , everything about this night seemed too familiar , yet she forced herself to smile back anyway . " Nothing . I 'm drinking nothing . Thanks , but excuse me . " It was time to go , before her own life swallowed her whole . In the next room , her best friend , Carolyn Kraus , swayed to a seductive song as a man 's hands roamed her slender curves from behind . Carolyn 's auburn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to welcome his slow , rhythmic kiss , and Lauren 's chest tightened . Then her gaze narrowed on the low V-cut of Carolyn 's fitted velvet pants , where three blue dolphins swam in a circle around her belly button . Lauren had heard at least a dozen men say it was the sexiest tattoo they 'd ever seen . She 'd been tempted to get a tattoo of her own-before remembering she thought sexiness came from the inside and that she did n't necessarily want to be sexy for the whole world anyway . She did n't want to be sexy for the countless Chads who flitted in and out of her life . And because the Chads seemed to be the only men who entered her life , she supposed she did n't really want to be sexy for anyone . Carolyn 's dance partner was another blond surfer type , this one sporting a ponytail and a swarthy I-live-in-the-sun complexion . Lauren watched , along with everyone else , as one of his bronzed hands skimmed Carolyn 's breast . The other flirted with the V of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-bye to Carolyn , but now abandoned the idea . She nearly collided with a handsome guy in a business suit , his tie undone . His eyes glimmered a bit too much , especially when his hand closed around her wrist . " Wan na dance ? " " No thanks , " she said firmly , pulling away . Stopping in the front room to retrieve her purse from beneath a couple making out on the couch , she made a beeline for the door and did n't look back . This was her life . And she hated it . Poor little rich girl . She smiled wryly to herself , dismayed at how very well she embodied that particular concept . Great , I 've become a cliche . But that did n't change the fact that money could n't buy happiness . Moments later , she sat behind the wheel of her silver Z4 , the headlights carving a path through the darkness on a road that edged the Gulf Coast . The Sun Coast , tourists called the shore that ran from north of Clearwater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lauren could see was a bright sliver of moon , and the taillights of the car in front of her , preventing her from going as fast as she wanted . Still , the fresh salt air cooled her face , and the breeze whipping through her hair delivered a sense of freedom . At least for right now she was free of her life , free of the night . No more parties with Carolyn , she lectured herself . Of course , she made this vow all the time , but Carolyn always prodded her . " It 'll be fun . What better do you have to do , sit behind that desk and work all night ? " Carolyn was her best friend , but over the years they 'd grown so different from each other . There were two kinds of women : those who could have meaningless sex with countless men and consider it casual fun , and those who could not . Carolyn could , and Lauren supposed it was probably nice to be so free , so much like a guy-but it also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common . Lauren definitively fell into the " could not " group . She 'd slept with only three men in her twenty-seven years-each of whom she 'd been in love with , and each of whom had left her heartbroken . Add to that a number of other relationships that had ended painfully , even without sex involved , and slowly but surely , she was getting wiser . Every time another guy with sexy eyes and a seductive smile crushed her heart a little flatter , she understood the injustices of life and love a bit more . In those moments , she longed to be like Carolyn , longed to have the ability to separate sex and emotion-but her soul would n't let her . One kiss was all it ever took . Either it felt wrong and she knew immediately that nothing more could happen , or it felt so deliciously right she 'd be lost to the guy , that quickly , with no hope of coming back up for air-until it was over . Turning left off the bridge that led from Sand Key to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sparkling water to the couples and families dotting the sidewalks beneath the streetlamps . A summer evening on the south end of Clearwater Beach meant ice-cream cones and hand-holding . Watching made her lonely . Exiting the roundabout onto the causeway , she pressed down on the gas for that blessed sense of freedom again , and the warm tropical wind enveloped her . No more parties with Carolyn , she repeated inside . No more of these hungry-eyed guys who think if you wear form-fitting clothing you 're ready to play mattress tag . She meant it . She was done dealing with those jerks , once and for all . Yet it would be hard to escape , because it was n't just Carolyn 's crowd who made her feel so awkward and sensitive . Lauren 's own father dated women her age and expected her to think it was normal . And although she and her dad never discussed sex ( thank God ) , if she asked him , he 'd probably guess she slept around a lot and would think that was normal , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties with Carolyn , but what about her father 's business parties ? Or the parties his partner , Phil , constantly threw ? As a high-ranking employee at Ash Builders , she had certain obligations , whether she liked it or not . Her life was one big pseudo-Hollywood bash . After taking a left through downtown Clearwater , she soon traveled the palm-lined boulevard that would lead her home , the bay once again shimmering in the dark alongside the road . Closing the garage door behind her minutes later , she entered the house to find Isadora stretched across her pink velvet pillow on the white sofa . " Hey , Izzy , " she cooed , reaching down to scratch the snowy Angora under her chin . But Isadora only shifted in sleep , seeming to say , Leave me alone . So she could n't even depend on her own cat to keep her company in her time of need . " Well , pooh on you . " Glad to be in the cozy safety of her own home , she headed upstairs , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through her wet hair , she slipped into a jade green chemise that suddenly struck her as far too alluring for a woman sleeping alone , but she liked the feel of silk next to her skin . Venturing to her office , she settled in the soft leather chair behind her desk , checked her e-mail , then turned off the computer , glad no big accounting crises had arisen at Ash Builders since that afternoon . She was just about to flick off the lamp when she caught a glimpse of a satiny red book peeking from between a quarterly report and a ten-pound dictionary on her bookshelf across the room . It was her sex journal . Not that she 'd had sex in a while-in fact , it had been two years since she 'd broken up with Daniel , the last man she 'd made love to . Maybe that was why she needed a sex journal . She kept it in her office to prevent any prying eyes , like Carolyn 's , from curiously snatching it up to see what was inside . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need occur for anyone but her to be in the room . Although she normally thought the book blended better with its Surroundings-tonight , for some reason , the red spine leapt out at her . She chuckled cynically and shook her head . If people only knew ; the irony was too rich . The girl they assumed was a bad girl was really a good girl , but the good girl had a dark side . A side no one else saw . A side that wished she could be like Carolyn-almost . Yet she needed so much more than Carolyn when it came to sex . She needed the after part . Without it , the rest was nothing . She recorded her sexual fantasies in the red book , though she hardly knew why . Moments like this , when the idea of sex practically repulsed her , writing down her fantasies felt almost dirty , immature . But maybe it was just a reminder that she had fantasies , that she was a healthy , red-blooded woman , not just this person who ran from every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because she dreamed of finding a man who could make every word she wrote feel good and right , instead of merely risque . Sighing , she padded to the shelf and reached for the book . She did n't open it , merely ran her hand over the smooth cover . The deepest , darkest part of her heart lay hidden in this book , her most intimate desires . It was the one secret she kept from the entire world ; not another living soul knew about it . Maybe that was why she had the journal . Because no one else knew . Maybe she just needed to acknowledge that this part of her existed . Returning the book to its place , Lauren turned off the lamp and headed for bed , still feeling quite alone in a world where people probably thought she had it all . Nick simultaneously checked the clock on his dashboard , shoved the last bite of a cruller into his mouth , and flipped on his turn signal . After swinging his van onto Bayview , he washed down the cruller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd grabbed at the 7-Eleven . The Stone Temple Pilots sang " Sour Girl " on his radio , turned down low ; he generally liked his music loud , but not this early in the morning . He figured subtle changes like that were the first signs of getting old . At thirty-two , some days he felt all of nineteen , and other days he felt more like a man approaching seventy . Today , he sensed both ends of the spectrum encroaching . After leaving the mansion-lined boulevard that ran along the bay , the air coming through his open window changed , thickened . It got hot early this time of year . But if he was honest , that probably was n't the only reason he was starting to sweat a little . Something tightened in his chest when the Ash mansion came into view . Henry 's house . He had n't seen the man up close in twenty years and had barely known him then , but that was how he thought of him , as Henry . Lauren Ash 's house sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of as the Ash Estate . It was n't as opulent as her father 's , but five times larger than any home his family had ever lived in , a scaled-down version of her father 's Greek temple stucco . He recalled hearing the story from other crew workers a few years back-she 'd decided she wanted a place of her own , so Daddy had built his little princess her own mini-mansion complete with a small fountain in front . He grimaced , realizing his own sense of size was getting distorted . The fountain was small compared to the one in front of Henry 's place , but it would do any city park proud . The van 's brakes squeaked lightly as he slowed to a stop before her house , separated from Henry 's colossal palace by a large stucco wall . They 'd saved a couple of enormous live oaks in front when they 'd built , then sprinkled the yard with a few palm and banana trees , adding color with tall snapdragons and bougainvillea . He could n't help thinking it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice a palm tree that had been bent by hurricane winds or a pelican diving for fish in the ocean . They were things Nick often no longer saw . Davy , though , still saw everything . Well , Nick thought as he pulled into her pale brick driveway , he hoped the Princess of Ash Builders was awake . He knew she worked at home and probably slept in , but he started work at seven and did n't change his schedule for anyone , not even the boss 's daughter . This was just another job , so he was n't sure why he suddenly felt twisted up inside . Although when the opportunity to work at the princess 's house had presented itself , he 'd accepted it while remembering all the Ash family had taken from his family . Maybe the truth was that he wanted , even needed , to look inside her world . He needed to see what could 've been his , should 've been his . What should 've also been Davy 's and Elaine 's . Just another job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling nineteen this morning , yet the old man inside him could n't let it go . He 'd seen too much and felt too much and knew how unfair the world could be . In ways , life was mostly settled for his family now , but scars had a way of opening up sometimes when you least expected it . And when he thought of the Ash family , an all-too-familiar fire gathered in his gut . It was the same fire that had forced him to stick up for Davy in the schoolyard when they were young , the same that had welled in him when his father would belittle Elaine , the same that had taught Nick to use his fists . It was a more controlled fire , now , though-he 'd worked hard learning to control it . So it was time to put those old feelings away and do what he 'd come here to do . Paint her house . That was all . Well , and maybe look at her life a little . Just to see what his life would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet somehow he could n't extinguish the slow burn inside him when he realized he was standing on the doorstep of the future he 'd lost . The door chime sounded just as Lauren reached to turn on the water in the shower . " Damn it , " she muttered . " If I 've told Phil once , I 've told him a thousand times ... " Not to show up at my door at the crack of dawn with a pile of invoices . She liked Phil , but since he was her father 's business partner , as well as company treasurer and production manager , she often saw more of him than she particularly enjoyed . He was the consummate company man , always putting Ash Builders above all things-including being considerate enough to wait for normal business hours before he started bugging her . She stopped the water with an annoyed flick of her wrist , then threw her chemise back on before grabbing a beige kimono from a hook inside her walk-in closet . Cinching it at the waist as she descended the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , twice . So he was irritated , was he ? Well , she could tell him a thing or two about irritation . She yanked open one of the front double doors and said , " Look- " Oh God . It was n't Phil . Continues ...
