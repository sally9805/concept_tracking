ENTANGLEMENT Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing . But an inner voice tells me that it is not yet the real thing . The theory says a lot , but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the Old One . I , at any rate , am convinced that He does not play at dice .  - -  Albert Einstein God may not play at dice , but She certainly knows how to count cards .  - -  Hannah Sharifi They cold-shipped her out , flash-frozen , body still bruised from last-minute upgrades . Later she remembered only pieces of the raid . The touch of a hand . The crack of rifle fire . A face flashing bright as a fish 's rise in dark water . And what she did remember she could n't talk about , or the psychtechs would know she 'd been hacking her own memory . But that was later . After the court-martial . After jump fade and the rehab tanks had stolen it from her . Before that the memory was still crisp and clear and unedited . Still hers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew Metz was going to be big as soon as she met the liaison officer TechComm sent out to brief her squad . Twenty minutes after Captain C. Xavier Soza , UNSC , hit planet surface he 'd gone into anaphylactic shock , and she was signing him into the on-base ER and querying her oracle for his next-of-kin list . Allergies went with the uniform , of course . Terraforming was just a benign form of biological warfare ; anyone who had to eat , breathe , or move in the Trusteeships got caught in the crossfire sometime . Still , no normal posthuman was that fragile . This time TechComm had sent out a genuine unadapted Ring-bred human . And clever young humans did n't get cold-shipped tothe Periphery , did n't risk decoherence and respiratory failure unless they 'd been sent out to do something that counted . Something the brass would n't trust to the AIs and colonials . Soza spent thirty hours in the tanks before he recovered enough to give them their briefing . He seemed alert when he finally showed up , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst case of hives Li had ever seen . " Major , " he said . " Sorry you had to deal with that little crisis . Not how I imagined my first meeting with the hero of Gilead . " Li flinched . Was she never going to enter a room without her reputation walking two steps in front of her ? " Forget it , " she said . " Happens to the best of us . " " Not to you . " She searched Soza 's handsome , unmistakably human face for an insult . She found none ; in fact his eyes dropped so quickly under her stare that she suspected he 'd let the words slip out without thinking how they sounded . She glanced at her squad , settling into chairs proportioned for humans , behind desks designed for humans , and she felt the usual twist of relief , shame , envy . It was pure accident , after all , that her ancestors had boarded a corporate ship and paid for their passage with blood and tissue instead of credit . Pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chance mutations of radiation exposure and terraforming fallout . Pure accident that made her an outsider even among posthumans . " No , " she told Soza finally . " Not to me . " Slip of the tongue or no , Soza was all smooth , cultured confidence when he stood up to give the briefing . His uniform hung the way only real wool could , and he spoke in smooth diplomatic Spanish that even the two newest enlisted men could follow without accessing hard memory . The very picture of a proper UN Peacekeeper . " The target is located below a beet-processing plant , " he told them , " hiding in its heat signature . " He subvocalized , and a streamspace schematic of the target folded into realspace like a spiny asymmetrical flower . " There are five underground labs , each one of them a small-run virufacture facility . The system is deadwalled . No spinstream ports , no VR grid , not even dial-in access . The only way to break it is to shunt the cracker in on a human operative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her habitual slouch and grinned wolfishly . There was a new scar along the rake of Kolodny 's cheekbone . Fresh , but not so fresh that Li should n't remember it . She searched her active files , came up empty . Ran a parity check . Nothing . Christ , she thought , feeling queasy , how much is missing this time ? She was going to have to get someone to put a patch on her start-up files . Someone who could keep a secret . Before she forgot more than she could afford to forget . " The rest of you will get the cracking team past the deadwall , " Soza was saying , " and collect biosamples while the AI goes fishing . We 're after whatever you can get on this raid . Source code , hardware , wetware . Especially wetware . Once the AI has the target code on cube , he wipes his tracks , and you withdraw . Hopefully without being detected . " " Which AI are we using ? " Li asked . But before Soza could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real name , of course . Still , he 'd been calling himself that for so long that few people even remembered his Toffoli number . Today 's interface was n't one Li had seen before , but she knew it was Cohen on shunt before he closed the door behind him . He wore a silk suit the color of fall leaves -- real silk , not tank-grown stuff -- and he moved with the smooth , spare grace of a multiplanetary network shunting through cutting-edge wetware . And there was the ironic smile , the hint of laughter behind the shunt 's long-lashed eyes , the faint but ever-present suggestion that whatever he was talking to you about could n't possibly be as important as the countless other pies he had his fingers in . As usual , he 'd appeared at exactly the right moment , but with no apparent idea what he was doing there . " Hallo ? " he said , blinking vaguely . " Oh . Right . The briefing . Did I miss anything ? " " Not yet , " Soza answered . " Glad you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Li glanced between the two men , wondering how they knew each other -- and how well they knew each other -- in the privileged world Ring-siders called normal life . Cohen caught her looking at him , smiled , took a half step toward the empty place next to her . She turned away . He took a seat in the back . He leaned over and whispered something in Kolodny 's ear as he sat down , and she smothered a laugh . " We interfering with your social life , Cohen ? " Li asked . " Like us to take the briefing elsewhere ? " " Sorry , " Kolodny muttered . Cohen just raised an eyebrow . As he did , a thin , dark-haired schoolboy trotted into Li 's frontbrain , dribbling a soccer ball . He pantomimed an elaborate apology , then bounced the ball off the toe of one cleated foot , tucked it under his arm , and loped off toward a point behind her right ear . The cleats tickled ; she had to resist the urge to reach up and rub her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Metz 's Bose-Einstein relay was sulking today . A rapid-fire barrage of status messages flashed across Li 's peripheral vision telling her that the relay station was establishing entanglement , acquiring a spinfoam channel , spincasting , matching spinbits to e-bits , running a Sharifi transform , correcting nontrivial spin deviations and dispatching the replicated datastream to whatever distant segments of Cohen 's network were monitoring this briefing . Before the first Bose-Einstein strike on Compson 's World -- before the first primitive entanglement banks and relay stations , before Hannah Sharifi and Coherence Theory -- a message from Metz to Earth would have taken almost three days in transit along a narrow and noisy noninteractive channel . Now Bose-Einstein arrays sent entangled data shooting through the spinfoam 's short-lived quantum mechanical wormholes quickly enough to link the whole of UN space into the vivid , evolving , emergent universe of the spinstream . Except today , apparently . &lt;Ca n't you get a better channel ? &gt; Li asked . &lt;I already have , &gt; Cohen answered before she 'd finished the thought . &lt;And if you cared about me , you 'd laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &gt; &lt;Pay attention , Cohen . Kolodny 's skin 's on the line tomorrow , even if yours isn't. &gt; Soza had turned back to the VR display and was explaining the logistics of the raid . If things went as planned , Cohen would shunt through Kolodny and retrieve the target code . The rest of Li 's squad had only two jobs : get the AI in and out and collect biosamples while he cracked on-line security . It sounded little different than the two dozen other tech raids Li had commanded , and she thought impatiently that Soza could have briefed them more efficiently by dumping the data into the squad 's shared hard memory . She sat through about five more minutes before interrupting him with the obvious but still-unanswered question . " So what are we looking for ? " " Ma'am , " Soza said . He hesitated , and Li saw a flicker of self-doubt behind his eyes . She thought back to her first command , remembered the panic of wondering if she could give orders to seasoned combat veterans and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 'd led Peacekeepers in combat against Syndicate ground troops long before her first official command . Hell , she 'd held a wartime field commission for three years before her CO would recommend a quarter-bred genetic for officers ' candidate school . " Our reports --  " Soza cleared his throat and continued . " Our reports indicate that the facility is producing products on the Controlled Technology List . " Someone -- Dalloway , Li thought -- snickered . " That 's not too helpful , " Li said . " Last time I saw the CTL it ran to a few thousand pages . We go in with that , we 're going to be confiscating wristwatches and toenail clippers . " " We also have strong evidence the parent corporation is Syndicate-friendly . " " That 's it ? " Li asked incredulously . " That 's it , " Soza said . He was lying , of course . She could see it in his eyes , which met her own gaze with unblinking , unnatural steadiness . Her mind flashed back to her first meeting with Helen Nguyen -- Christ , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger than Soza then , but she 'd already survived Gilead . And she 'd known , standing in the discreet office of the woman whispered to be the UN 's most ruthless and successful spymaster , that Nguyen 's support could help her survive peacetime . Bad liars always think they can make a lie stick with eye contact , Nguyen had murmured , an unnerving smile playing across her lips . But they 're wrong , of course . There 's no trick to lying well except practice . So go practice . That is , if you want to work for me . Li stood up and flicked a thumb toward the door . " Can we speak privately , Captain ? " Squad members caught their breath , muttered , shifted on their benches . Fine , Li thought ; it would n't hurt morale if they knew she was willing to go to bat for them . But that did n't mean she was going to dress down a TechComm liaison officer in front of them . She followed Soza toward the door . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and slipped out after them without even asking if he was wanted . " Come on , " Li said as soon as the three of them were out in the empty corridor . " Let 's hear the real story . " " That is the real story , " Soza said , still standing by his lie and putting his faith in eye contact . " That 's what Intel gave us . " " No , it 's not . Even Intel is n't that stupid . This your first trip to the Periphery , Soza ? " He did n't answer . " Right . Well , let me tell you what they did n't tell you in your official briefing . Half the population of this planet are registered genetic constructs . The other half do n't know what the hell they are and could n't qualify for a clean passport even if they had the money to pay for a genetic assay . The only human in-system besides you is the governor . His air 's shipped in , his food and water 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , and he might as well be on Earth itself for all he has to do with anything . I could put you in a cab and drive you to places where people have never seen a human , where they 'd look at you like you 'd look at a mastodon . The Syndicates , on the other hand , are practically neighbors . We 're eight months sublight from KnowlesSyndicate , fifteen from MotaiSyndicate . You can catch a ride to Syndicate space on half the freighters in-system as long as you 're willing to pay cash , keep your mouth shut , and forget you ever met your fellow passengers . " Soza started to speak , but Li put up a hand impatiently . " I 'm not being disloyal . Just realistic . We put riot troops on-surface here during the incursions . That 's not the kind of thing people get over , whichever side of the gun they 're on . And the Secretariat knows it . That 's why they tread so lightly in the Trusteeships these days . And why they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raid just because some local company is a little too friendly with the Syndicates . No . There 's a reason for this raid . And the right thing for you to do is play straight with me about it . " " I ca n't , " Soza said . He glanced at Cohen for support , but the AI just shrugged . Li waited . Soza laughed awkwardly . " General Nguyen warned me about your , uh , persuasiveness , Major . Look , I really admire you . You should have made colonel in your last go-round . Everyone who does n't have his head stuck in a hole knows it . You 're a credit to . . . well , all colonials . But you know that kind of politically sensitive information is n't cleared for release to line troops . " " It 's cleared for release to you , though . " " Well . . . of course . " " And you 'll be dropping with us tomorrow ? " She asked the question in a carefully neutral voice . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't going to sugarcoat it . " No , " Soza said . At least he had the grace to blush . " So when the shooting starts , we 'll have no one on the ground who knows enough to tell us when it 's time to cut our losses and leave . I 'm not willing to send my people into action under those conditions . " That hit Soza where he lived . " They 're not your people , Major . They 're UN Peacekeepers . And they 're under TechComm command for the duration of this mission . " " TechComm does n't have to visit their parents when we send them home in boxes , " Li said . She stood toe-to-toe with Soza and looked straight into his eyes so he could see the green status light blink off behind her left pupil as she shut down her black box . " Look . Feed 's off . This is soft memory only . It 'll wipe as soon as we jump out-system . " Well , not quite . But hopefully Soza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kink Peacekeeper datafiles . " You 're not authorized for that information , " Soza said stiffly . This time he did n't call her Major . " Well , " Cohen said on-line . " That was n't exactly a smashing success . " Li ignored him .
