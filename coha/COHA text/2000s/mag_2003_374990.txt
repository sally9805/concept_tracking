Traveling overseas might not be high on your list of things to do right now . But if you 're willing to brave airline security and risk exposure to SARS , it 's probably a good idea to take along a mobile phone that works . No ordinary phone will do , however . To stay connected overseas , you need what they call a world phone  --  a device that conforms to an international standard for worldwide reception . I recently tested two models on a trip to London and Barcelona and found them surprisingly reliable  --  but expensive to use . <P> Despite hemorrhaging in the travel industry and continued trouble in the telecom sector , many carriers have chosen this moment to introduce new international price plans and beef up their roaming options . The preferred tech standard for world phones is GSM ( Global System for Mobile Communications ) , a protocol that once worked only in Europe but is rapidly being adopted around the globe . AT &T; Wireless , Cingular and T-Mobile are the three major GSM carriers in the U.S. <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( $350 ) from T-Mobile and a Sony Ericsson T68i ( $50 ) from AT &T; Wireless . Both devices let you check e-mail as well as take and send pictures . Both seemed , at first glance , relatively user-friendly , but when I landed at Heathrow neither worked properly . It was only after some concerted fiddling that I realized the value of a pretrip checklist . <P> For starters , make sure your phone is , in fact , a world phone . Do n't trust your salesman ; call customer service for the definitive answer . Also , make sure it has been activated for international roaming . While you 're at it , ask about carriers . When you land in another country , your phone will probably offer a choice of service providers , not all of which allow you to send and receive data . Last , to save time , make sure you have all your international dialing codes before you head off to the airport . <P> The good news is that once I ironed out the kinks , the phones worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Square to a medieval fortress in Tortosa , Spain . But talk ai n't cheap . T-Mobile 's WorldClass roaming plan starts with a 99-a-minute plan that covers 26 European countries , but in other countries you may pay as much as $4.99 a minute . AT &T; Wireless WorldConnect and Cingular have similar offerings but they start at $1.29 a minute . <P> Checking e-mail costs a few cents per kilobyte  --  but the kilobytes add up , especially when your In box is full of spam that weighs in at an average of 8K per message . Therein lies the trouble with e-mail . Most handsets require you to open each piece of mail that you want to delete . You can skip messages , but then you will have to download the subject lines again on your next visit . If you want to save some money , wait until you get home to clean out your In box . <P> For me , the cost of the phones was well worth the peace of mind I got in return . Just be sure to remind everyone back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off your ringer before you go to sleep . <P> Questions ? You can e-mail
