<p> THERE is something unnerving about watching a polar bear stalk across floating sea ice high in the Arctic and doing so from the frigid waters directly beneath the bear , the world 's largest four-legged predator . <p> Overhead , through ice so thin that it is transparent , plate-size paws set down , one after the other , as the half-ton animal pursues its prey . <p> Gripping moments like this abound in " Arctic Tale , " a new film exploring challenges facing polar bears and walruses , two familiar denizens of the icy , but warming , seas at the top of the world . But " Arctic Tale " is not a typical addition to a lengthening line of somber documentaries on dangerous or endangered wildlife . <p> Instead , Adam Ravetch and Sarah Robertson , a husband and wife who have spent the better part of two decades filming the Arctic 's hulking , reclusive and sometimes deadly mammals for television nature shows , sifted through more than 800 hours of their own footage and that of other filmmakers to assemble a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this unorthodox gambit to tell of the entwined lives and travails of two composite characters , Nanu , a young bear , and Seela , a walrus . Their stories are related , fable style , by Queen Latifah , and include scenes ranging from the wrenching , when a bear cub falters and fades in a relentless blizzard , to the comic , when a heap of basking walruses erupt into a flatulent chorus after bingeing on clams . ( An adult can eat 4,000 a day . ) <p> " Arctic Tale " is clearly aimed at the same audiences that flocked in unexpected numbers to " An Inconvenient Truth , " which chronicled Al Gore 's climate campaign , and " March of the Penguins , " which followed the life cycle of rugged inhabitants from the other frozen end of the world . But Adam Leipzig , the president of National Geographic Films , which produced the film , said the project was conceived two years ago , before either documentary became a hit . The idea , he said , was to make a wildlife film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Paramount Classics will release the film on Friday in New York and Los Angeles , and nationwide in mid-August . ) <p> Some early reviews have questioned the value of assembling footage of various animals at different life stages to construct artificial life stories complete with humanlike villains and heroes , including a walrus " Auntie " who gives her life in defense of Seela . <p> The trade newspaper Variety noted that " the anthropomorphism is relentless , as animal communities are mined for their most recognizably human characteristics  --  not hard to do , given the outsized personalities of the main subjects . " <p> Mr. Leipzig defended the approach , saying the goal was to create a new genre of " wildlife adventure " movies . <p> " It is n't fictionalized in the way that ' Transformers ' is fictionalized , " Mr. Leipzig said . " This genre is movies about the creatures of the world as they actually exist , with their real behaviors documented by the foremost wildlife cinematographers in the world and crafted into stories that can entertain and educate audiences and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Mr. Ravetch , like Mr. Leipzig , sees the emotional power of the film flowing from the images and moments more than the imagined story . <p> " When you see a mother hug an animal , that 's undeniably an act of emotion and caring , " he said . " In the scene where a mother polar bear has to cast off the baby because she ca n't fend for the both of them anymore , it 's got sort of that tough-love feel . But you see that emotion in the footage . " <p> Providing the characters with names , Ms. Robertson said , makes it easier to relate to the animals through the stages of their lives . The Hollywood tactics also ensure that the movie plays as a parable about adjusting to changing conditions on a warming planet . <p> The Arctic in recent decades has experienced sharp warming and a dramatic pullback of sea ice in summers , developments that many climate experts attribute at least in part to the buildup of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping emissions in the atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later this century the Arctic Ocean  --  routinely cloaked with sea ice for thousands of years  --  could be open blue water in summers . <p> The shifting conditions prompted federal scientists last December to propose a " threatened " listing for polar bears under the Endangered Species Act and a fresh assessment of the species ' prospects is under way . <p> Polar bears , partly due to animated Coke ads and dozens of zoo exhibits , have carved out a cuddly place in popular culture , but up close and personal they are ferocious predators , making the task of collecting the raw footage for the movie a daunting exercise . All wildlife filming has its challenges , whether in the Amazon , Himalayas or Serengeti . But it would be hard to top the difficulty of filming polar bears outside the few spots where they congregate in significant numbers , like Churchill , Manitoba , except perhaps if one 's quarry is walruses , which are even larger ( big ones can exceed the dimensions of a Mini Cooper ) and can be just as dangerous if spooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal is to chronicle the lives of these species both above and under the floating ice , which is where Ms. Robertson and Mr. Ravetch , a seasoned diver as well as wildlife cinematographer , have gone repeatedly since the early 1990s . <p> Often with their children in tow , they spent season after season pursuing pivotal scenes in the lives of their quarry : the tentative first foray out of a snow-covered den by two polar bear cubs , after which one topples backward comically into the hole ; the embrace of a walrus calf , umbilical cord still trailing , in the surprisingly dexterous flippers of its mother ; the tutorials in which a mother polar bear shows cubs how to reach a seal cached in layered sea ice by rearing up to full height and hammering stiff forelegs downward ; a chilling attack by a polar bear on a walrus amid a great jiggling panicked mass of the tusked marine mammals . <p> Scientists who have worked with the couple over the years credited their devotion to revealing the hidden lives of elusive species and willingness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Adam is one of the few serious filmmakers that work on Arctic marine mammals , " said Mads Peter Heide-Jorgensen , a Danish expert on bowhead whales and narwhals who has been accompanied by Mr. Ravetch . " He has of course a tremendous amount of experience , but he is also quite open to scientific input and ideas , and he has an excellent relationship with local Inuit . " <p> While no filmmaker or animal was harmed in the making of this film , Mr. Ravetch said , that was not for lack of risk . <p> In one boat trip in the Canadian Arctic , he said , a bear came sniffing around the four- by-six-foot tent he was sharing with two Inuit hunters after they pulled to shore to rest . <p> " To get awoken that way , with a quarter-inch of material between the bear and my ear " he said , trailing off . " We had rifles and shot up into the air from inside the tent . " <p> After things were silent for a while , he recalled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locker in the bow of the small power boat , which was high and dry because the tide had ebbed . <p> " You have three men in this bow locker in fetal positions , with no door , " Mr. Ravetch recalled . " So we put this drum in front of the locker . In the morning when we woke up , the bear was sleeping 10 feet from our boat . The tide was still not in . " <p> They waited out the bear . <p> While the filmmakers conducted much of their fieldwork with Inuit seal and walrus hunters , no humans are shown in the film , and the main antagonist confronting the bears and walruses is climate change . <p> Mr. Ravetch said he has seen Arctic conditions shift starkly since 1990 , when he and Ms. Robertson started filming in the far north . Around Baffin Island in northern Canada , he said , where thick ice was the norm in springtime years ago , seas are often a dangerous slushy mess . <p> In one scene a mother bear and cubs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a waterbed underfoot . <p> " We 've seen these areas getting warmer to the point where this last year by April it had been raining for three months , " Mr. Ravetch said . <p> Another reason for having named , if composite , animal characters , Ms. Robertson said , was " to give climate change a face . " <p> " Climate change is a bunch of statistics for many people , " Ms. Robertson said . " But regionally climate change is affecting not only people but animals . We wanted to really settle in on the moments and the decisions and reactions of animals when they are faced in regional areas with climate change . " <p> Despite the challenges of the ice retreat ( the ice helps polar bears , for example , stalk and ambush seals , and is a haven for walrus pups ) , she and Mr. Ravetch said they were convinced that both species would endure . " Polar bears and walruses are resourceful learners , so over the short term they 'll find new ways to hunt and live , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the impossible , and in the long term we really do n't know what will happen to them , which is true also for ourselves . It 's going to be a journey for every creature on the planet . " <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com
