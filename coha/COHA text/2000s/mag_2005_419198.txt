ASTRONOMERS , BOTH AMATEUR and professional , are struck with " aperture envy , " the seemingly endless hunger for everlarger telescopes . The urge is driven by the desire to collect more light in order to see faint objects better and discover others never seen before . But often a telescope shows you more by collecting less light - that is , by being selective about the kinds of light it records . This is of course where a filter comes into play : it allows only light of certain wavelengths to reach the detector , be it an electronic chip or a piece of film . Broadband filters are the ones with which we 're most familiar . They let pass a relatively wide range of wavelengths , usually a range of reds , greens , or blues . A narrowband filter transmits a much smaller range of wavelengths - one that usually is centered on a specific emission line produced by a particular atom or ion . While color images have traditionally been made with broadband filters , many of the recent spectacular images produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrowband filters . The Hubble Space Telescope 's famous image of the Eagle Nebula ( M16 ) is one well-known example . Now amateurs are getting in on the act . This image of IC 1848 , a beautiful ionized-hydrogen ( H II ) region in Cassiopeia , is an excellent example of the narrowband imaging now being done in many backyards . California 's Richard Crisp obtained a total of 12 exposures , each 20 minutes long , through S II , H-alpha , and O III filters . These filters are designed to transmit specific emissions from sulfur ions , hydrogen atoms , and oxygen ions , respectively . As Crisp explains starting on page 112 , he assigned colors to these respective bands in order of increasing wavelength , with O III color-coded blue , H-alpha green , and S II red . Known as chromatic order , this is the same scheme used in the famous M16 image . Narrowband filters are valuable not only because they transmit desired emissions but also because they block all others . Amateurs have used such filters for years to mitigate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to isolate the light emitted by particular chemical elements under particular physical conditions . They use the resulting data to map properties like temperature , density , and the abundances of various chemical elements . In this case color reveals temperature , with bluer parcels of gas being hotter than the orange ones . For this reason , such color schemes are often referred to as " representative . " Some may balk at such palettes because they do not show a nebula as the human eye would see it . But keep in mind that the whole point of using a telescope in the first place is to show what the eye can not see .
