Chapter One The night was too damn cold to be out on the streets . But the tall man with the knit cap pulled low over his face just hunched inside his green army jacket and stamped his feet to keep warm . A two-day beard stubbled his face and dark , greasy hair hung beneath the cap . On the street he was known as Turq , short for " turquoise , " the color of his deepset eyes . Half a block from the west side projects , he stood near a burned out streetlight where an abandoned grocery store hulked on the corner . Hidden in the shadows was the gun he planned to buy . The seller was late , and Turq cursed silently . His neck bothered him . Two nights ago , he 'd been popped in the head during a routine drug sweep in the Dutchman 's Tavern , and the cold was making it ache . His cell phone vibrated against his hip . " Yo , " Turq said low . " What 's up , uncle ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the street and up the block , but still able to trail his every move . " My date is late . " Footsteps approached . " Catch you later , dude , " Turq said . The seller rounded the corner . Fifteen at best , he was scrawny , dressed in hip-hop mode with chains and a tracksuit hanging on his lanky form . The kid swaggered confidently toward Turq , who groaned under his breath . The young ones were the worst . You never knew what they 'd do . Turq did n't waste time . " You got it ? " The seller eyed him suspiciously . " You got the dead presidents ? " " Two hundred . Cash . That was the deal . " " Yeah , but I do n't know you , bro . And I do n't do business with peeps I do n't know . " Christ . Turq tightened his jaw . First the guy was late , then he started giving attitude . Forcing himself to relax , he stuck out his hand . " Name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . " He grinned sheepishly . " It 's Danny . " He left off Sinofsky , hoping the first name would be enough . " But do n't you go telling no one . " Slowly , the seller shook his hand . " Danny , huh . Now that 's about the whitest name I know . " " We friends now ? " The seller shrugged . In the dim moonlight his skin looked creamy and smooth , no trace of beard yet . Danny tasted sadness . Kids killing kids . " Yeah , okay , Danny , " the seller said . " So where is it ? " " Not here . I got it stashed . " Damn . Changing locations was not a good idea . It meant his ghosts would have to follow in the catch car . If they could follow , and sometimes they could n't . Or it could mean a setup . Take the money and run . And he had a lot of money on him . But an illegal gun was a gun , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it here , bro . That 's the deal . " The kid took a step back . " Fuck that shit . Cops all over the place . " " It 's here or no place . " " Then it 's no place , dawg . " The kid turned around . Christ . " Hold up ! " Going somewhere else sucked big time , but so was letting another gim me hang on the street where innocent civvies ended up paying the price . The latest vic had been a three-year-old girl . " Where we going ? " " I 'll take you . " " I got ta know where first . " If he could alert his ghosts , who were listening on a hidden wire , they had a better chance of keeping tabs . But the night was not going Danny 's way . " It 's a sweet little secret spot . I got me a car waiting . " The kid did n't look old enough to drive . Fuck . " Okay . Got ta have that piece . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner to a rusted 1972 Chevy Camaro that was once gold and now looked like faded dirt . " You got a job in mind ? " Danny gave the kid a long look . " Never mind what I got in mind . I got the bills . That 's all you need to know . " The seller nodded , fifteen going on fifty . " You got that right . " Danny got into the car , fingers tingling , adrenaline pumping . He imagined Parnell popping his cork when he found out . He almost grinned , picturing his lieutenant 's face . The car wheezed down Market Street toward the railroad tracks by the river . A century ago , this was the commercial heart of Sokanan . Barges from Manhattan traveled up the Hudson and off-loaded at the dockside warehouses , filling up with light manufactured goods and produce from Hudson Valley farms . Freight trains did the same , going west . Now the place was deserted , though the upswing in business from the Renaissance Oil deal , which brought a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warehouse row into a shopping mall on the lines of Faneuil Hall in Boston . But all that was down the pike . Right now the place was dark and dusty . " So where are we ? " Danny asked , feeding clues to his ghosts . " Down by warehouse row ? " " You got eyes , do n't you ? " The seller pulled off the main drag onto a narrow path heading west toward the Hudson . The car bumped over old cobbles , then parked in a dirt yard fronting a derelict warehouse . Moonlight bounced off the river , creating shadows and gloom . Faded yellow letters at the top of the brick building spelled out its name , but Danny could make out only an M and a C. " McClanahan , " Danny murmured . " What you talking about ? " Danny nodded toward the warehouse . " The building . See the ' M ' and the ' C ' ? I 'll bet that was McClanahan 's . " " Who gives a shit ? " Danny did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Murky and abandoned . No way backup could get there without being noticed . His palms were sweating but he followed the seller toward the looming structure . He did not want to go into that warehouse . " Where is it ? " Danny asked . " Inside . " Shit . " Go get it . I 'll wait here . That place gives me the- " The warehouse flickered in front of him . For a second he was in complete darkness . He stumbled , almost fell . What the f-A gunshot cracked above him where his head would have been . Someone grunted and his vision cleared . In that split second he saw the boy down on the ground . Danny dove behind a dumpster as another shot chased him . " Rounds fired ! " he shouted into the hidden wire . " I 'm behind a dumpster by the old McClanahan warehouse . " His cell vibrated . He grabbed it . " You got the location ? " " We got you , uncle . " Danny looked around . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than that to die . The shot had come from the warehouse roof . An excellent position , it gave the shooter coverage of the entire area , while Danny was pinned down-no vest , no weapon , just a fistful of cash for protection . Trapped , he banged the back of his head against the bin 's metal side in frustration . A shot pinged off the edge and instinctively he ducked . The young seller lay unmoving facedown on the ground , the soles of his Nikes to the sky . Was the kid carrying ? It would n't surprise him . In any case , he could n't leave him out there , wounded and exposed to the shooter . He crawled to the edge of the blue bin , reached out and got shot at for his trouble . Shit . He snatched back his hand , took a breath , tried again . This time , he managed to latch onto one of the boy 's feet . He dragged the body toward him . It jerked as another bullet hit . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him over . His eyes were wide open and a black circle decorated the middle of his forehead . Fuck . Who the hell was out there ? No time to think about it . He scrabbled over the body and found a fully loaded nine beneath the tracksuit . Would n't do much good against the high-powered rifle the shooter had , but it was better than nothing . He peered around the corner of the dumpster and , once again , his vision sputtered out . He blinked as cars squealed into the area , sirens screaming . Doors slammed , shots fired . Bayliss over the bullhorn . " This is the police ! Throw the rifle down ! " Then another voice over that . " Sin ! Where are you ? Sin ! " Hands shook him . " Jesus Christ , what happened ? " It was Mike Finelli , his other ghost . " Danny ? Sin ? You all right ? " " Yeah , I 'm fine . Except I ca n't see a fucking thing . " " It 's called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so calm and matter-of-fact he wanted to deck her . He did n't know how long he 'd been in the hospital , but it felt like years . He 'd been shuffled off to doctors and technicians who were a mush of voices with no faces . Now he sat in some kind of armchair ; he could feel the shape and the fabric . And from the quiet and lack of movement around him , he sensed he was in a private office . And this doctor-Christ , he could n't even remember her name-was telling him ... " You 're kidding . One minute I 'm fine and the next minute I 'm fucking blind ? " " You had a stroke . " " I 'm thirty-two and healthy as a horse . Guys like me do n't have strokes . " " I understand you were hit in the head two days ago . " " In my line of work I get hit a lot . What the hell does that have to do with anything ? " " You injured your neck , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's the one right at the top of your spine . The tear allowed blood to dissect-to seep-into the arterial wall . The blood embolized . Clotted . The clot traveled to the top of the basilar artery , the main artery at the back of the head . It went from there to one of the posterior cerebral arteries and fragmented , plugging up your cortex . " " Yeah , but why ca n't I see ? " " Because the messages from your eyes ca n't get to the cortex , which is where they 're interpreted . It 's called a bilateral occipital stroke . " The words slid over him like so much fog . His heart was thudding wildly , his mouth was dry . He wondered if he 'd been shot at the warehouse instead of the seller and this was a coma dream from which he would eventually wake . " Detective Sinofsky ? " " Yeah . " " Do you have any other questions ? " He hesitated , feeling lost , adrift . " Am I ... " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a short pause . " No . " She spoke the word quietly , with compassion and complete certainty . He nodded , dread gripping him . " Any chance this will go away ? " Another short pause . " It 's possible . There have been cases of it clearing up on its own . " " But ? " " But the damage is extensive . I would n't count on it . I 'm sorry . " He heard the sound of her rising , the swish of clothing , the creak of a chair . " I 'm going to set you up with a social worker . She 'll get you into rehab . You 'll need a mobility instructor . " He sat there , not taking any of this in . Ahand touched his shoulder . He flinched . " How are you getting home ? " He had no idea . " Are you married ? " He shook his head . " A girlfriend ? Parents , relative ? " His mother was dead , and he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll , uh , I 'll call a friend . " He 'd been in and out of his clothes , his eyes and his head poked and prodded , his body X-rayed . But now he was back in his street wear-the ripped jeans and ancient army jacket that belonged to Turq . Fumbling in the huge pockets , he found his cell phone below Turq 's knit cap . His fingers searched the buttons for the correct ones , but his hand was shaking . Gently , someone took the phone from him . " What 's the number ? " Doctor whoever . He swallowed . His brain had stopped and it took a moment to jumpstart it again . But he remembered it at last and told her . A minute later she handed him the phone . Mike Finelli 's voice came on the line , an anchor of familiarity . " It 's me , " Danny said , desperate to keep the tremor out of his voice . " Sin . Where are you ? I 've been at the hospital all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's going on ? Are you okay ? " Not really . But he was n't ready to get into that . " I need a ride home . " " Beth 's here . I think she 's got that covered . " A phone rang and he heard the doctor pick up and speak softly into it . " What about her kids ? " he asked Finelli . " I do n't know . They 're not with her . " " All right . I 'll call Beth on her cell and tell her where to meet me . " " She 's right here- " A hand touched his arm . " Hold on , " he said to Mike . " Mr. Sinofsky ? " A bright , cheery voice . " I 'm Pat Embry . I 'll be taking you to the waiting room where your mobility instructor will meet you . " " They 're taking me somewhere , " he told Mike . " I 'll have them call Beth when I get there . " " If you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . He pictured a plump , big bosomed woman with tightly curled hair-an Aunt Bea type-but her hand , which she kept on him while he complied , was bony and smelled of disinfectant . " Just a few steps , " she told him brightly as if he were three . " Here 's your chair . " He felt the leather sides of a wheelchair and something tightened in his chest . " That 's right . Good boy . Comfy ? " His hands fisted . " Okay , here we go . " They 'd all warned her about him . Everyone from the supervising social worker to the nurse 's aide had given her a sharp-eyed look , a cautionary word . But she did n't need a warning because she remembered him . Someone had wheeled him into the patient 's lounge and he 'd managed to find his way out of the chair . One arm propped against the wall , he faced the window as though drinking in the night . His jeans were outrageously worn , faded and ripped . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , she would have thought his wardrobe would at least have improved . His black T-shirt was in much better shape . The sleeves strained over well-defined biceps . A man 's biceps to match a man 's body . Tall and rangy , he had wide shoulders that tapered down to a lean waist and a tight rear . A jungle cat . Strong , healthy . Young . Looking at him , even from the back , she felt the opposite . She stepped into the room , and his shoulders stiffened . He 'd heard her . " Detective Sinofsky ? " He turned and hit her with the full force of his face . Even prepared , she nearly gasped . Age had given him lines and hollows , hardened him into an adult . But he was still dark and intense with a face born of fantasy . Of dangerous dreams deep in the night . Far away , deep in the recesses of her soul , something stirred . An echo of an echo , so thin and faint it was easy to pretend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and still piercingly turquoise . Clear and transparent as the Caribbean . And healthy- looking . No injury marred the lids or sockets . Nothing at all to signal they were useless . " Danny Sinofsky ? " " Who wants to know ? " She swallowed , glad he could n't see the shock and pity she did n't hide fast enough . Would he have recognized her ? Half hoping , half dreading , she steeled her voice into the safe rhythms of brisk objectivity . " Martha Crowe . " She waited just the merest second to see if her name jarred memories . But he stared expressionlessly at her , and she doused the quick jab of disappointment . " I 'm a rehab teacher and an O and M instructor-Orientation and Mobility . I 'd like to talk to you about your options . " " Options ? " " We can get started with a cane immediately . But there are other things to think about . Adog . Even some electronic devices . " His face , tough and impossibly handsome , even shadowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The expression was eerie because it looked as though he could really see her . " I 'm fine . " Not one for false comfort , she opted for bluntness as a way to cut through the anger . " You 're not fine . You 're blind . " He tensed , coiled , muscles waiting to spring . " It 's temporary . " Continues ...
