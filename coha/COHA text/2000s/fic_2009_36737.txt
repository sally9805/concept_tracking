In the movies there was always a warning before something bad happened . Music swelled , the good guy promised everything would be fine now or the camera suddenly went into slow motion . <p> Life was n't so tidy . <p> Izzy Titan sat in the window seat , as she had every day for the past month , staring out at a blurry world and feeling sorry for herself . While it was n't a career choice everyone would make , it filled the day . She ignored her sisters ' pleas that she join them for lunch or shopping or even come downstairs to dinner . Like a regular person . When it got too annoying , she pointed out she was n't regular anymore  --  she was handicapped . If that did n't work , she slammed the door and locked it until they went away . She 'd always given everything she had , so she was ready to become the self-pity queen , if necessary . <p> Finally her sisters stopped bugging her . Which should have been a really big clue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was sitting in her usual spot , the next , someone grabbed her around the waist , pulled her to her feet , then tossed her over a very broad , very hard shoulder . <p> " What the hell do you think you 're doing ? " she yelled as blood rushed to her head , making her a little dizzy . <p> " My job . Go ahead and fight me all you want . You ca n't hurt me . " <p> It was a challenge she could n't ignore . But when she tried to kick her attacker , he wrapped one arm around her legs , holding her still . Wiggling did n't help either . The man had muscles like rock and a month of immobilizing self-pity had left her girlishly weak . <p> " I swear , " she began , as the guy turned and started walking . " Do you know who I am ? " <p> " Izzy Titan . Hey , Skye . " <p> Hey , Skye ? <p> Izzy raised her head and tried to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could n't see any details . <p> " Skye ? " she yelled . " Are you there ? " <p> " Oh , Izzy . " Her sister sounded concerned , but not worried . Not afraid . " We did n't know what else to do . " <p> " We ? " <p> " I 'm here , too , " Lexi , her other sister , said . " This is for your own good . " <p> " Having me kidnapped ? " <p> " Nick comes very highly recommended . You told us that your doctors wanted to put you on an antidepressant , which you would n't agree to . This is better . " <p> " What ? " <p> " You would n't leave your room or talk to us . It 's been a month , Izzy . " <p> " You 're having me kidnapped because I would n't go shopping with you ? Are you insane ? " <p> They moved into the hallway . She could tell because the room got darker and her fingers brushed against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , down into more darkness . <p> Each step jarred her entire body . If she 'd had that lunch her sisters were so hysterical about she would be throwing it up , right about now . <p> " I 'm not kidding , " she yelled . " Stop this right now . All of you . Nick , I do n't care what my sisters said , I did n't agree to this . Put me down or I swear I 'll throw your ass in jail for so long , you 'll actually learn to enjoy being Bubba 's love slave . " <p> " You signed a release , " rock-guy said calmly , still moving through the house . <p> " What ? " <p> " You signed a release . I 've got it here in my pocket . " <p> Izzy wanted to scream in frustration as she remembered Skye asking her to sign a few checks so her sister could pay Izzy 's bills . " She tricked me . I 'm blind ! I did n't know what I was signing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outline of trees and the welcome light and heat of the sun . <p> " You should n't sign what you ca n't read , " Nick told her . <p> She could hear the humor in his voice and that really pissed her off . Seconds later , he opened a car door and dumped her onto a smooth leather seat . Before he could close the door , she pushed past him and bolted for freedom . She made it all of three steps before he grabbed her around the waist and pulled her against him . <p> It was like pressing against the side of a mountain . She kicked and tried to pull her arm free . Irritation turned to fury and betrayal . She turned toward the house  --  at least she could see something that big  --  and assumed her sisters were on the porch . <p> " How could you do this to me ? " she demanded . " You 're my family . " <p> " Izzy , we love you . " There were tears in Skye 's voice . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty for the rest of her life . <p> " We did n't know what else to do , " Lexi called , sounding less than sure . <p> " I would never do this to you , " Izzy screamed . " Do n't think I 'll ever forgive you . Ever ! " <p> The last word was cut short as she was tossed back into the rear of a car or SUV . She could n't tell which . The door slammed shut before she could run again . She lunged for the door handle , only there was n't one . Nor could she open the windows . <p> Seconds later she discovered a thick , mesh screening behind the seat and between her and the front of the vehicle . She was trapped . <p> She heard the door open and vaguely saw Nick slide behind the wheel . Then they were driving away . Her sisters had hired a stranger to take her from her home and do God-knows-what to her . They 'd abandoned her . No . This was worse  --  this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd counted on her entire life had discovered she was too much trouble and had tossed her out like the trash . <p> For the next three hours , Nick Hollister drove ten miles above the speed limit . He wanted to go faster , but knew he could n't outrun the inevitable . His pretty , dark-haired passenger was staring out the window with a determination that told him she was about ten seconds from losing it . <p> " You can cry if you want to , " he said . " It wo n't bother me . " He 'd seen a lot worse than tears . <p> Izzy did n't turn toward him . " I wo n't give you the satisfaction . " <p> " You think I win if you cry ? " <p> " Do n't bullies always enjoy knowing they 've hurt someone ? You did n't win . You ca n't break me . " <p> She raised her chin as she spoke , instinctively defying him . Good , he thought grimly . She was going to need every ounce of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . Which was his job  --  to make sure she did . <p> " Break you ? " he asked , ignoring that she 'd called him a bully . He 'd stormed into her life and taken her away from everything she knew . Hardly comfortable circumstances . He understood the fear of the unknown , although her unknown was a whole lot more controlled than his had been . " Dramatic much ? " <p> " Hey , you 're the one who tossed me into the back of a car . " <p> " SUV . " <p> " Whatever . This is kidnapping . I get to be however I want . " <p> " Your sisters know where you are and what will happen when you get there . " <p> " And I should find that comforting why ? " She swallowed . " Do n't even talk to me . " <p> He heard the fear in her voice . He could see it in the way she kept herself stiff . Behind fear was terror and while he wanted her attention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My name is Nick Hollister , " he said , using the same tone that calmed unbroken horses . " I run a school that teaches corporate survival training . That pays the bills . I also take in kids who have suffered a traumatic loss or been victims of a violent crime . I teach them how to survive in my world . That helps them cope with their own . " <p> Izzy stared out the window , obviously ignoring him . He wondered how much she could actually see . <p> " Your sisters asked me to take you on for a few weeks , to help you adjust to being blind . " <p> " I 'm not blind , " she snapped . " I have thirty percent of my sight . " <p> " You 're acting like you 're blind , " he told her . " You 've been hiding in your room for a month . " <p> " It 's not like I can do anything else . " <p> " Your life is over ? Because of one little challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she yelled . " You do n't know what you 're talking about . You can see fine . " <p> " Would n't it be interesting if I could n't ? " He swerved slightly as he spoke . The SUV swayed . Izzy did n't bother looking up . <p> " Very funny . " <p> " I thought it was , " he said . " Look . They care about you . Your sisters , " he added , in case she was n't following . <p> This time she did glance at him , only to roll her eyes . The hazel irises were unmarred by her injury . " I 'm more than capable of carrying on a conversation . I 'm probably smarter than you . " <p> " I doubt that . " <p> " Oh , please . " <p> " How smart is sitting on your ass , feeling sorry for yourself ? " <p> She straightened and glared at him . " I was in an explosion , " she said , speaking slowly , as if to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been killed . " <p> " But you were n't . " <p> " I was seriously injured and I lost most of my eyesight . " <p> " Which you could get back tomorrow if you were n't such a girl about the surgery . " <p> He glanced in the rearview mirror in time to see her narrow her gaze . <p> " A girl ? " she asked softly . <p> " Yeah . You know . Chicken . Lacking in bravery . " <p> " That 's it ! " she yelled . " Let me out , right here . Let me out or I swear , I 'll kill you myself . I 'll rip you apart with my bare hands and feed your body to the snakes . " <p> " Snakes would n't eat human flesh . " <p> " Shut up ! " <p> " Skye did n't say anything about you being hysterical . " <p> " Let me out ! " <p> " No . " <p> She grabbed the mesh screening and rattled it , but it had withstood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her . <p> " She did warn me you would be difficult , " he said . " I charge extra for that . " <p> Izzy sank back in the seat and resumed staring out the back window . <p> " If you wo n't have the surgery , then you have to survive with what you have , " he told her . " That 's where I come in . I teach you how to make it . You 're staying with me until you can be on your own . " <p> " What if I do n't want to be on my own ? " <p> " You think your sisters want you hanging around all the time ? They have lives . You 're what ? Twenty-five ? Twenty-six ? You ready to give up so fast ? " <p> " Go to hell . " <p> " I 've already been there . " <p> He turned onto the familiar paved , private road and drove toward the two-story main house . He 'd bought the run-down ranch nearly eight years before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he used the twenty acres of wilderness for his retreats . He kept a dozen horses in the big barn and had built several guesthouses where clients stayed . There were meeting facilities , a restaurant-grade kitchen that could serve up to fifty at a time and a big media room that rivaled a multiplex . <p> Not that Izzy would deal with much more than the barn . He planned to work her hard enough that she did n't have time to feel sorry for herself . The little he knew about her told him she would fight him every step of the way , but he did n't care about that . He would win , as she put it , in the end because he had to . <p> He parked in front of the house and turned off the engine . <p> " We 're here , " he said in the silence . <p> Izzy folded her arms across her chest and stared out the window . <p> " When I let you out , you can run if you want . We 're about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearest town . But if you want to go looking , I wo n't stop you . The temperature is close to a hundred . Without water , you 'll last maybe three days . Assuming you do n't get bit by a rattler and die sooner . " <p> " Oooh , " Izzy said , still not looking at him . " I 'm all tingly with fear . Want to threaten me with whips and chains next ? " <p> " I do n't usually work with adults , but I 've made an exception for you . Do n't think this is going to be easy . You 'll work for your room and board . No work , no food . " <p> She snapped her head around until she was facing him . " My sisters are paying you . You ca n't starve me . " <p> He grinned . " I can do anything I want . I 'm not the one who 's blind . " <p> " Fuck you . " <p> " You 're not my type . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have scrambled over the seat and gone after Nick with everything she had . He was so smug and mean and dismissive . Did n't he know what she 'd been through ? She 'd lost most of her sight . It was easy to be oh , so confident when you had n't suffered . She would bet Nick did n't know anything about being afraid . <p> She hated him and right now she hated her sisters . It was hard to say who she resented more . Anger burned within her , making her want to lash out . The problem was there was n't anyone she could fight . At least not yet . <p> Nick climbed out of the SUV and walked around to her side . The door opened . She felt the blast of afternoon heat on her skin . <p> She wanted to be back at Lexi 's house , in the cool room with the window seat . Over the past month , the four walls had been a refuge . But her sisters had sent her away . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat and followed Nick into a large house . The second they walked inside , the light dimmed and so did her ability to see . The world darkened until it was little more than blurry shapes . <p> " This is the main house , " he said . " You 'll be sleeping upstairs . First door on the left . There 's an attached bathroom . You 'll find your luggage there . You can unpack later . This is the living room . We do n't use it much . Through here is the kitchen . " <p> She knew from his voice he 'd moved away , but had trouble seeing . She managed to follow him , only to bump into a table and then trip on a single step he had n't bothered to mention . She tried to catch herself , but there was too much momentum . The ground raced toward her . <p> A familiar strong arm grabbed her around the waist and jerked her to her feet . <p> " Maybe you should use a cane , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " You 'll figure it out . " <p> " That 's it ? " she demanded . " Let 's pause for a moment , because your incredible concern is making me all teary-eyed . I fell . " <p> " I know . So what ? You 're going to fall . Then you 're going to get up and move on . Or are you the type to just lie there , feeling sorry for yourself ? Never mind . I already know the answer . " <p> She wanted to tell him she was n't like that . She was the one who climbed mountains and jumped out of airplanes and swam with sharks . She did n't believe in self-pity or giving up . At least she had n't until the explosion . <p> " You do n't understand , " she told him . <p> " You sure about that ? " <p> She heard footsteps , but could n't tell the direction . Who else was here and what would he or she want from her ? <p> " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to sign , Nick . And you must be Izzy . I 've heard so many wonderful things about you . " <p> The man reached for her hand and shook it . His fingers were nearly as soft and smooth as Skye 's or Lexi 's . <br> Continues ...
