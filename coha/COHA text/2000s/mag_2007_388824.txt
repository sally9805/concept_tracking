And when holidays arrive , bringing favorite visitors , foods and rituals , connections are reinforced and hearts are touched . Bernice A. King , a daughter of Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. , and Coretta Scott King ( and now a minister in her own right ) , blesses us with precious family memories and reflections on the meaning of the day . To add to the celebratory mood , on the following pages we offer festive Easter dinner recipes that feature the season 's freshest ingredients . On Easter Morning BY BERNICE A. KING When we were growing up in the South , our Easter celebrations actually began on Saturday . That was the day of the Easter Egg hunt . We would gather at the church and travel on its bright blue-and-white bus to the home of my aunt Naomi King . Her house was located on the southwest side of Atlanta and had a sprawling , beautiful front lawn . The adults would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the bushes and landscaping for us kids to find . We would laugh and play the entire time as we collected eggs in our baskets , hoping to win by having the most . I was usually the youngest of the bunch and wound up on the losing end , but it was also a part of the tradition for all the kids to share their eggs at the close of the hunt . It was the lesson of sharing that we took away from the game . During my late teens I joined the grown-ups ' side of the hunt and could n't resist giving the littlest ones a few clues as to where they might find hidden treasure . Then on Easter morning , as on every Sunday , my sister , Yolanda , our brothers , Martin and Dexter , and I would be responsible for making breakfast for the entire family . Each week we would alternate and have to get up earlier than the others to prepare the eggs , bacon , grits and toast . ( This routine was my mother 's way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethic for within and outside the home . ) When we were all gathered for breakfast , before sitting down to eat , each child would read aloud a Bible verse from a little book with a red heart on the cover that our mother had given each of us . It was then off to Sunday school at Ebenezer Baptist Church , where my grandfather Martin Luther King , Sr , was pastor . We loved going to church . It seemed that the congregation was just one big family . It was there , in the Children 's Chapel , that the boys , in their new suits , and we girls , in new frilly dresses , patent leather shoes and bonnets tied with ribbons under our chins , proudly recited our speeches for the Easter pageant . When my father was alive , we would return home fora glorious holiday dinner . Even for a regular Sunday meal , Mother 's aesthetic was no paper , no plastic . And celebrations were all the more special with linens , china , multiple serving and eating utensils placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her favorite flower . There were always two or three additional place settings , as my father was sure to invite others to join us . After losing my dad and , the next year , his brother , A.D. , my grandfather became the surrogate father of both families , and he began the tradition of bringing all the King families together for Easter . To accommodate the layers of extended family and lots of children , our dinners were often held at Morrison 's , a local restaurant . Our Easter celebrations , in a sense , became our family reunions . They were loud , joyful affairs with much fellowshipping and eating . I am now a member of New Birth Missionary Baptist Church , a megachurch led by Bishop Eddie L. Long . We will celebrate Easter service at the Georgia Dome , with about 40,000 people worshipping together . Easter is now a different experience from what I knew as a child . This day of Resurrection will , however , always be a time of profoundly loving memories and one that causes my spirit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ORANGE BABY CARROTS Makes 8 servings. 2 pounds fresh baby carrots cup orange juice 1 tablespoon orange zest ( grated peel ) 1 teaspoon salt ( optional ) 4 tablespoons butter ( cup ) 2 tablespoons sugar teaspoon ground cumin or cinnamon Optional garnish : orange zest Trim carrot stems , leaving about inch on each carrot .
