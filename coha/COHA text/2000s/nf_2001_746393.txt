This study examined the application of a Langian imagery perspective ( Lang , 1979 , 1985 ) to a real-life sporting task , namely field hockey penalty flick performance , Twenty-seven novice hockey players were randomly assigned to either one of two imagery groups , or a control group . Participants in one of the imagery groups received stimulus and response proposition-laden imagery scripts , while the other received stimulus proposition-only scripts . All imagery participants imagined performing twenty penalty flicks three times per week for seven weeks , and control participants performed no imagery or physical practice during this period Pre- and post-tests consisted often penalo , flicks , with performances recorded for all groups . The response proposition group improved to a significantly ( p &lt; .05 ) greater degree than the stimulus proposition-only group , which in turn showed greater improvement ( p &lt; .05 ) than the controls . Results support the application of bio-informational theory to sport and indicate that imagery scripts should be laden with response propositions to maximize their effectiveness . <p> During the past century , over a hundred studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Murphy , 1990 ) , and most have shown imagery to be an effective performance enhancement technique ( see recta-analyses by Driskell , Copper &; Moran , 1994 , and Feltz &; Landers , 1983 ) . The typical method in such investigations has been to perform a pre-test on the relevant skill , then split participants into three groups that perform equal amounts of either physical practice or imagery , or do nothing at all . Generally , the physical practice group performs significantly better on a post-test than the imagery group which , in turn , performs significantly better than the control group . <p> These studies have provided extremely valuable information as to the usefulness of imagery in enhancing the performance of many different motor skills . However , few sport psychology studies have attempted to examine either the mechanism(s) through which imagery enhances performance , or the relative effectiveness of different types of theoretically-based imagery interventions . Thus , the sport psychology literature to date has offered limited help to sport psychologists , coaches and athletes who wish to know not only whether imagery can enhance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best to implement an imagery intervention to produce optimal results ( Keil , Holmes , Bennett , Davids &; Smith , 2000 ; Murphy , 1990 ) . <p> One theoretical position from mainstream psychology , which has received increasing attention from sport psychologists ( Bakker , Boschker &; Chung , 1996 ; Collins &; Hale , 1997 ; Hecker &; Kaczor , 1988 ; Keil et al. , 2000 ) , is bio-informational theory ( Lang , 1979 , 1985 ) . According to this theory , all knowledge is represented in memory as processed , abstract units of information regarding objects , relationships and events . These units of information are termed propositions , of which there are three fundamental categories : stimulus , response and meaning propositions . Stimulus propositions are the descriptive referents relating to the external environment . For example , taking a penalty flick in the final minute of a close field hockey match would involve the stimulus propositions of the sight of the goal and the noise made by the crowd . Response propositions describe the responses of the individual to the stimuli in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as limb and eye movements , and autonomic changes such as sweating and alterations in heart rate . For example , responses in the above situation might include muscle contractions , dry mouth , sweaty palms and increased heart rate . Meaning propositions are analytical and interpretative , adding components of information not available from the stimuli in the situation . They define the significance of events and the consequences of action . For example , meaning propositions in the above situation might include the knowledge that the scores are even , that there is only one minute left in the match and that the match is a major championship final , and thus the outcome is important for the individual 's goal achievement . <p> According to Lang ( 1985 ) , the processing of response propositions initiates the motor program for the imagined action , and can lead to physiological responses , termed ' efferent leakage ' , in relevant muscles and organs . Furthermore , the use of response and meaning propositions in imagery manipulations serves more effectively to access , and subsequently strengthen , the associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus , under this theoretical perspective , the processing of all categories of propositional information is crucial since it is the accessing , and subsequent strengthening , of the motor program that is hypothesized to enhance performance . <p> Recent work ( Decety , 1996 ; Jeannerod , 1997 ) has suggested that the motor program may be part of a biological representational structure associated with both the physical and imaginary execution of a skill . It is well recognized that experience can modify the structure and function of the brain due to its plastic nature ( Kolb &; Whishaw , 1998 ) . If cortical reorganization can occur through physical practice of a motor task , imagery of the same behavior , accessing the same motor representation , should also be able to re-model cortical structures . This is supported by a large amount of research showing common neuronal mechanisms in imagery and like-modality perception ( Kosslyn , 1988 ) , and more specifically the functional equivalence research which shows similar cortical neuronal activity during imaginary and actual motor performance ( for a review , see Jeannerod , 1997 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strong , integrated model for motor imagery . <p> Lang 's theory was developed to explain the therapeutic effects of imagery upon individuals suffering from anxiety disorders , but it has been postulated ( Hale , 1994 ) that the theory could be applied equally to the use of imagery in sport . The first researchers to test this hypothesis were Hecker and Kaczor ( 1988 ) , who instructed college athletes to imagine four scenes : A neutral scene ( sitting outside on a summer afternoon ) , an unfamiliar fear scene ( being in an out-of-control jet plane ) , a familiar action scene ( bench pressing ) , and a familiar athletic anxiety scene ( walking to the batter 's box at a crucial point in a baseball game ) . The scene descriptions all contained response propositions except for the neutral scene . Heart rate was significantly greater during the action scene compared to the neutral scene , and there was a non-significant trend for heart rate to be greater during the athletic scene compared to the neutral scene . Therefore , these results appear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> More recently , Bakker , Boschker and Chung ( 1996 ) examined changes in muscle activity when participants imagined lifting weights using either stimulus or response proposition-laden imagery scripts . Electromyographic ( EMG ) activity was monitored during the lifting , and significantly greater EMG activity was found during the response proposition condition compared to the stimulus proposition condition , as predicted by bio-informational theory . <p> Therefore , there is some evidence that bio-informational theory may indeed be generalizable to the imagery of motor skills . However , the above-mentioned studies have concentrated only on the psychophysiological aspects of bio-informational theory . Although this research is clearly interesting and valuable , it does not answer the question of whether imagery interventions based on bio-informational theory are more effective in enhancing motor skill performance than those based solely on stimulus proposition-based scripts . In fact , this issue has not yet been addressed in any published sport psychology studies . This is a very important issue , as research in clinical psychology has shown **25;1027;TOOLONG imagery interventions to be significantly more effective than stimulus proposition-only interventions ( see Cuthbert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Given the almost ubiquitous use of imagery in sport , the degree to which these findings generalize to the imagery of motor skills is clearly an issue that merits investigation . Therefore , the aim of this study was to examine this question using an intact real life skill , namely field hockey penalty flick performance , as the dependent variable . It was hypothesized that penalty flick performance would be enhanced to a significantly greater degree by the administration of a stimulus and response proposition-laden imagery intervention , than by the administration of a stimulus proposition-only intervention . Method <p> Participants <p> Twenty-seven undergraduates , seven male and twenty female ( mean age = 20.0 years , S.D. = ( 3.43 ) participated in the study . Although we recognize that sex differences exist with regard to hemispheric lateralization , for example on spatial abilities ( see Kolb &; Whishaw , 1996 ) , it was felt acceptable to use mixed-sex groups as participants were randomly allocated to groups and no between-group differences in imagery ability were identified ( see Results ) . None of the participants had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any previous imagery training , as identified through pre-experimental interviews . Ali participants provided informed consent prior to participating . <p> Instruments <p> Movement Imagery Questionnaire - Revised ( MIQ-R ; Hall &; Martin , 1997 ) . The MIQR is a revised version of the Movement Imagery Questionnaire ( MIQ ; Hall &; Pongrac , 1983 ) . The scale consists of eight items , four visual and four kinesthetic . The higher the score , the easier a movement is to imagine for that individual . It has acceptable concurrent validity when correlated with the original MIQ , with r values of - .77 , - .77 and - .87 for the visual subscale , kinesthetic subscale and overall score respectively ( Hall &; Martin , 1997 ) . The negative correlation is due to a reversal in the scale since , in the original MIQ , the higher the rating , the harder a movement was to imagine for the respondent . <p> Procedures <p> The participants completed the MIQ-R and were randomly assigned to one of three groups , each consisting of nine participants : A stimulus proposition group , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group . <p> Prior to the administration of the intervention , a pre-test was carried out . Each participant was allowed five practice shots prior to the pre-test , which consisted of twenty penalty flicks into a field hockey goal . Each flick was taken from the penalty spot , which was 6.5 meters in front of the center of the goal line . Two flags , which signified the boundaries of designated scoring areas , were placed on the goal line , 40 centimeters from either post . if the ball was flicked between the goal post and flag , the participant scored two points . If the ball was flicked in between the flags in the center of the goal , the participant scored one point . No points were awarded if the ball did not enter the goal or if the ball did not leave the ground at any point . Thus , each participant was awarded a total score out of a maximum of forty . Participants were instructed to attempt to flick the ball between the goal post and flag at each attempt . This scoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task , as normally in a match situation the goalkeeper would be in the center of the goal . Thus , a goal would be more likely to be scored if the ball was shot into the corner of the goal . No goalkeeper was used because the responses of a goalkeeper may have confounded the results , but as noted the scoring system took account of the goalkeeper 's neutral position . <p> Following the pre-test , the imagery interventions were introduced to the participants . The intervention introduced to the stimulus and response group participants , which was based upon the tenets of Lang 's ( 1979,1985 ) bio-informational theory , commenced with a procedure known as response training ( Lang , Kozak , Miller , Levin &; McLean , 1980 ) . This involved focusing the participants upon actual responses , by eliciting and reinforcing verbal reports of physiological and behavioral involvement in the scene , thus emphasizing a response orientation toward the imagery . The information gained from each individual participant was then used to create that participant 's individualized imagery script , which was loaded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprisingly , there was considerable inter-individual variation in the participants ' reported responses . Typical response propositions included references to feelings of tension in the hands and forearm as they gripped the hockey stick , and the stinging sensation of the cold air blowing against the face . All members of this group were instructed to perform their imagery , in real time , after reading the script . Participants were issued with an imagery diary which they were instructed to sign when they had completed each imagery session , and to note down any difficulties they experienced while performing their imagery . <p> In accordance with previous research in clinical psychology ( Lang et al. , 1980 ) , participants in the stimulus group were given stimulus training , in which the stimulus details in the participants ' images were solicited and reinforced . As the stimulus details reported by the stimulus participants were all very similar to each other , stimulus participants were provided with the same , stimulus proposition-laden imagery script , matched in length to the response proposition-laden scripts provided for the stimulus and response group . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the script simply described the imagined scene , without reference to the physiological responses of the participant . The stimulus elements included the sight of the hockey stick , the ball and the goal , and the sound of other people on the hockey pitches around them . As with the stimulus and response group , the stimulus group participants were issued with an imagery diary , and were instructed to perform their imagery after reading the script . <p> Each participant in the experimental groups performed his or her imagery three times per week for seven weeks , with each imagery session consisting of twenty imagined penalty flicks . Control group participants were instructed not to perform , or to imagine performing , the penalty flick during this period . A post-test , once again consisting of twenty penalty flicks , was then carried out . It was decided not to have control participants perform a ' placebo ' task between the pre- and post-tests , as the results of previous research ( see Driskell , Copper &; Moran , 1994 ) indicate that the use of ' placebo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control groups in imagery experiments . However , to ensure consistency , all groups received equal attention , in terms of time , from the experimental team to reduce Hawthorne effects . In place of the stimulus or response training , general information regarding hockey was discussed . <p> Post-experimental manipulation checks , in the form of brief interviews , were conducted to ensure that the imagery instructions were being followed correctly , as per the recommendations of Goginsky and Collins ( 1996 ) . The interviews with the stimulus group participants revealed that none of them imagined or experienced the kinesthesis associated with performing the task , but instead ' pictured themselves ' performing the task . This indicated that the stimulus training and instructions had been successful in producing a stimulus orientation in the stimulus participants with regard to their imagery . This is because simply ' visualizing ' a scene , i.e. using the external visual perspective which is the subject of ongoing research ( Hardy &; Callow , 1999 ; Smith , Collins &; Hale , 1998 ) , would presumably mostly involve the processing of stimulus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagining these stimulus elements , the stimulus and response group participants reported vividly imagining the physiological sensations associated with performing the task . Therefore , the manipulation check provided a strong indication that the response training and instructions given had been effective in producing a response orientation in the stimulus and response group participants with regard to their imagery . Thus , it appears that the manipulations performed with both imagery groups were effective . Self-reports showed that the participants perceived their imagery to be effective in enhancing performance , in addition , the imagery diaries of the participants , which were examined following the post-test by the first and third authors , revealed that all scheduled imagery sessions had been completed . No difficulties had been noted by any of the participants , again indicating the effectiveness of the imagery training performed following the pre-test . Results <p> A MANOVA was performed to examine differences in MIQ-R scores between the two imagery groups . No significant overall effect was found ( Wilks ' Lambda = .92 , F 2,15 = .66 , p &gt; .05 ) . <p> Figure 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in the pre-test for all three experimental groups . The mean scores of the stimulus and response group increased by 47.4% in the post-test compared to the pre-test . The mean scores of the stimulus and control groups increased by 31.1% and .5% respectively . All participants in the imagery groups improved their performance in the post-test compared to the pre-test , whereas only three of the control participants showed slight improvements . To examine between-group differences in performance , a group x test ANOVA was performed . This revealed a significant interaction effect ( F2,24 = 25.52 , p &lt; .001 ) . Follow-up Tukey HSD tests revealed no significant between-group differences in pre-test scores ( p &gt; .05 in all cases ) . However , the post-test scores of the stimulus and response group were significantly ( p &lt; .05 ) greater than the post-test scores of the stimulus group . In turn , the post-test scores of the stimulus group were significantly ( p &lt; .05 ) greater than those of the control group . Effect size calculations ( Cohen , 1988 ) revealed that the effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulus and response , stimulus and control groups = 5.21 , 2.24 and .04 respectively ) . Discussion <p> These results provide strong support for the effectiveness of imagery as a means of enhancing the hockey penalty flick performance of beginners , as both imagery groups improved to a significantly greater degree than the control group . Also ( and more importantly , for the purposes of this study ) , the stimulus and response proposition-based intervention produced significantly greater improvements than the stimulus proposition-only intervention , providing clear support for this prediction of bio-informational theory . <p> According to bio-informational theory , these results can be explained by the accessing and strengthening of the motor program , which occurs due to the processing of response propositions . The processing of stimulus propositions is hypothesized to be insufficient to allow this process to take place . Of course , this does not mean that stimulus proposition-only scripts are of no value in enhancing motor performance , as processes other than the strengthening of the motor program may explain at least some of the positive effects of imagery upon performance ( for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1984 , and Martin &; Hall , 1995 ) . However , the theory does suggest that personalized , response proposition-laden interventions should be the most effective , and this was clearly the case in the present study . <p> Similar results have been shown in the clinical psychology literature , with regard to the use of emotional imagery ( for a review , see Cuthbert , Vrana &; Bradley , 1991 ) . However , this is the first time that this aspect of the theory has been tested in relation to the imagery of motor skills , and the result has interesting practical implications for the administration of imagery interventions in sport . For example , although the importance of including response propositions in motor imagery scripts has been emphasized by several authors ( Bakker , Boschker &; Chung , 1996 ; Collins &; Hale , 1997 ; Hale , 1994 ; Hecker &; Kaczor , 1988 ) , some sport psychologists ( e.g. , Tenenbaum et al. , 1995 ) still refer to the process as ' visualization ' , conceptualizing it as a purely visual experience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less effective , for the reasons outlined above . In addition , generic ( i.e. , non-personalized ) imagery scripts have been made available for use by sport psychologists ( Cabral &; Crisfield , 1996 ) . However , according to bio-informational theory , more effective results may be achieved if the imagery intervention is personalized , as the individual is unlikely to relate fully to an intervention which is not specifically based on his or her own experiences ( Cuthbert , Vrana &; Bradley , 1991 ; Lang , 1985 ) . <p> The need to personalize imagery scripts was indicated not only by the relative performances of the two experimental groups , but also by the responses given by the participants when interviewed following the pre-test . All the participants reported differing physiological responses when performing the hockey flick . No two answers were identical , indicating that , if sport psychologists use generic scripts rather than personalized ones , some athletes may have difficulty relating to them , and therefore the imagery is likely to be less effective . However , it is important to note that such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stimulus propositions reported by participants . Indeed , as noted in the Method , the stimulus propositions reported were so similar that identical stimulus proposition-only scripts had to be given to participants in the stimulus group . This does not mean that the interventions performed with the stimulus group participants were not personally relevant : after all , each participant 's script included the stimulus propositions that he or she had reported , in the same way as the scripts read by the participants in the response group included the stimulus and response propositions that they had reported . However , it does indicate that sport psychologists need to pay particular attention to individual differences in perceived physiological responses when administering imagery interventions . <p> Finally , it should be emphasized that the current study has shown the above-noted effects in respect of novice performers . Previous research ( see meta-analysis by Driskell , Copper &; Moran , 1994 ) has found that more experienced performers tend to benefit more from imagery than do novices . This being the case , perhaps expert hockey players would have improved to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . More research examining the effects of different types of imagery scripts on performers of varying skill levels would be a valuable addition to the literature on this important topic . <p> GRAPH : Figure 1 .
