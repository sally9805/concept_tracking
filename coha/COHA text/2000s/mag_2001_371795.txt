The attack itself was disturbing enough . As an Israeli bus approached Emmanuel , a Jewish settlement in the West Bank , a band of Palestinian guerrillas detonated two roadside bombs . When passengers fled the stricken vehicle , the militants gunned them down and flung grenades in their direction . Ten civilians were killed in the assault , and 30 were injured . <P> Then came the added horror . It was not just the usual suspect , the radical Islamic group Hamas , that took responsibility for the outrage . Also claiming a part was the Aqsa Martyrs Brigade , an underground militia associated with Yasser Arafat . That would be the same Yasser Arafat that Israel was supposed to count on to rein in Palestinian terrorists . <P> Hamas did n't want to share the credit , but the fact that the Martyrs Brigade implicated itself in the bus attack was the latest sign that Arafat 's own putative loyalists are now participating in the mayhem . That development is one reason the government of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon last week officially cut contacts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cabinet Minister Tzipi Livni : " It 's no longer that the Palestinian Authority is n't doing enough . Some of the Authority people have become part of these terrorist organizations . " <P> Hamas and groups associated with Arafat have developed increasingly close links since the collapse of the Camp David peace talks in the summer of 2000 . After rejecting Israel 's offer for a final settlement , Arafat returned home to encourage a new intifadeh , or uprising . Once the promise of a negotiated settlement with Israel faded , there was no longer a major ideological division between Arafat 's secular nationalists and the Islamists , who reject any accommodation with Israel . <P> To facilitate the less lethal aspects of the intifadeh , such as political rallies and funerals for slain compatriots , the two factions formed a National and Islamic Committee in every Palestinian town . The committee includes members of Hamas and its spin-off , Islamic Jihad , as well as the various components of the Palestine Liberation Organization , including Arafat 's party , Fatah . Contacts on this level helped foster similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " notes a senior official in Israeli military intelligence , " are not a marginal phenomenon lately . " The links between these organizations , as well as between the Islamists and the official security forces of the Authority , have become so complex and active that the Shin Bet , the Israeli version of the FBI , has set up a sophisticated computer program to keep track of them all . <P> Arafat 's duplicitous messages  --  publicly he talks about making peace with Israel ; privately he 's militant  --  have helped bring the two strands of Palestinian politics together . The Authority , notes a security official in the Gaza Strip , " has played a double game throughout the intifadeh . " What 's more , says an Israeli security official in the West Bank , with central command in the Authority deteriorating in recent months , many local security and militia leaders are unclear whether they are supposed to be initiating terrorist attacks , closing their eyes to other people 's terrorist attacks or trying to prevent terrorist attacks . In that situation , these leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups .
