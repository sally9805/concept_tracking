<p> It 's one of the first rules of fund-raising : Donors are happiest if they can get a little face time with the candidate . <p> A personal appearance is practically a must at any group event . Direct contact is better . Enabling the donors to hear the candidate 's voice or have the warmth of a smile beamed personally in their direction is best of all . Thank-you notes are always a nice touch afterward . <p> The novice candidate knew nothing of this three months ago . She did n't have a clue about the demands she would be facing , but now she understands it as intimately as if her life depended on it . <p> That 's because it does . <p> Melannie Veliz is a candidate for a lung transplant , not political office . But the similarity of her quest is surprisingly similar . Few political candidates enjoy raising money , but they do what is necessary because that 's what it takes to win . <p> The 11-year-old Chilean immigrant needs to raise a lot of money to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , so she does what she has to do . Otherwise , the doctors say that her advanced case of cystic fibrosis could kill her within a year . <p> On Friday , Melannie 's classmates at Smith Elementary School in Aurora threw her a surprise birthday party that they turned into a fund-raiser , bringing their pennies in plastic sandwich bags . <p> Melannie sat at midcourt in the school gym while the other 560 students in the school filed past her one-by-one and dropped their bags of money in a basket . Melannie , wearing a paper crown while seated in a chair decorated to look like a throne , flashed her radiant smile at each schoolmate who made eye contact and said thank you to everyone who told her happy birthday . <p> To keep the crowd manageable , the classes took turns going through the receiving line , then every student made her a birthday card before collecting their own reward upon departure : a big cupcake . This process created downtime between classes , and the weariness showed on Melannie 's face as she waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by emptying the money from the individual containers into one of those large water cooler jugs , which quickly filled . <p> The previous night , a local pizza parlor opened its doors for a $3.50 per person pasta dinner with the $1,100 in proceeds directed to the Melannie Veliz Fund . <p> On Saturday , the volunteer committee that is spearheading her cause held another birthday party , and later that evening , the consulates of Chile and Peru were holding a fund-raising event for her benefit at a hotel near O'Hare Airport . She was expecting to attend both . <p> This coming Friday is a big benefit concert at West Aurora High School . On April 23 , the Illinois Math and Science Academy has scheduled a Battle of the DJs to help her out . <p> If she 's not in the hospital , you can be sure that Melannie will be there for both of those , too  --  as well as at the May 4 fund-raiser being planned for her by Congressman Luis Gutierrez and at the June 7 event scheduled by Hispanic union electricians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Aurora . <p> She just got back from another two-week stay at the University of Chicago Children 's Hospital , where Dr. Marc Hershenson at the school 's Cystic Fibrosis Center has taken the lead in providing her care . <p> " I feel better , " Melannie told me after Friday 's birthday party . <p> It was readily apparent that feeling better was n't the same as feeling well . Her quiet voice was interrupted by the little cough that comes from deep within her lungs , the result of the cystic fibrosis that could eventually arrest her breathing . <p> She is philosophical about the demands on her time , although you can tell she 'd just as soon be home watching SpongeBob Squarepants , all other things being equal . <p> " I have to meet people that are helping me , " she explained . <p> " All the money 's for me , so I have to go there , and I have some fun , too . I always go to every party that 's going to give me the money . April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Whenever she has a spare moment , she reads through all the messages of support that accompany the money . <p> " I have to plan a day to do the thank-you cards , " she said . <p> Yes , it 's always hard to get the thank-you cards done , even if you 're not in the hospital every other month . <p> In the three months since I first told you about Melannie , donations of $216,000 have been received by the charitable fund established by her fifth-grade teacher Maria Lopez . <p> I find it extraordinarily heartwarming that so many people would be so caring . <p> You will recall that the complicating factor here is that her family is in the country illegally , her parents having overstayed their visa now by a year . They have no insurance , and their immigration status makes them ineligible for Medicaid . <p> The St. Louis hospital where Melannie is trying to get a transplant ( very few hospitals perform lung transplants on children ) has declined to evaluate her for the transplant waiting list until she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was initially pegged at $309,000 , then later revised upward to $450,000 . Hershenson and others have been negotiating to persuade the hospital to go ahead and put her on the waiting list based on the early showing of financial support . <p> A new roadblock is her immigration status . The hospital is balking at the prospect of giving her the transplant only to see the family deported afterward while she still needs specialized care . Gutierrez is trying to work something out with the Immigration and Naturalization Service . <p> You can get angry at the hospital , but the underlying problem is that there are so few organs of any type available for transplant . Nobody wants to waste them . As I mentioned last time , you can help plenty if you just sign up to be an organ donor . Nobody will be taking your organs until you 're finished with them . <p> Even if Melannie gets on the waiting list , there is no guarantee she will get her transplant . If she gets a transplant , there is no guarantee she will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June Gorecki , 60 , who came to Melannie 's birthday party , knows this well . She received a lung transplant two years ago and has been lending her support to Melannie . <p> Gorecki gazed admiringly at the little girl as she sat on her makeshift throne . <p> " She 's gotten used to the attention . She 's becoming a real pro at it . You do whatever you have to do to get that transplant , " Gorecki said . " I worked up until the day before my transplant , for insurance purposes . You can just look at her eyes and see how she hurts , but she 's being so brave . Life 's not fair , period , but you fight for it . You have to fight if you want to be a survivor . " <p> Melannie wants to be a survivor , and we can help make it easier on her . There 's no quitting now with the job half done . <p> Email : markbrown@suntimes.com <p> ? 176-129 ?
