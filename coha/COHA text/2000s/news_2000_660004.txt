<p> For Tom Calgaro , there was never much mystery about what he would do when he grew up . The teenager lives on Mesabi Iron Range , and since his youngest days he 's looked ahead , happily , to a life excavating , milling , and refining the ocher earth that lies beneath the jack pine of northern Minnesota . It has been a way of life in his family for generations . Since 1920 , there has been a Tom Calgaro working the rock here , back to his great-grandfather who shoveled raw iron ore into the skip cars that carried it to the surface and off to the blast furnaces of the world . " My father has always told me if you want to live around here , to have this life , the mines are the best idea , " says Tom , who lives on a ranch here . " And I like the large-scale equipment , the big stuff . I 'm not much of a computer guy . " But in the end , all of the teen 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom Calgaro working on the Mesabi 20 years from now . Come spring , the Range 's oldest working mine is scheduled to close - and , to many , it 's more than just another idle American plant . It 's a sign that in the great economic reshuffling of the 21st century , a way of work - and perhaps a way of life - are vanishing . In the onward rush to find global markets and tap overseas labor , the Mesabi iron workers certainly are n't the only ones to feel cheated by prosperity . From Detroit 's auto workers to Pittsburgh 's steelmen , periodic retrenchments and industrial shifts have suddenly taken away paychecks and wrought wrenching change in local economies . But in Minnesota 's isolated and insular mining country , the transition is more fundamental . It is affecting the culture of the region the way the demise of the shoe mills and textile plants of New England did a century ago . Mining money built towns like Eveleth and Chisholm and Biwabik . It built local schools . It gave definition and purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who first settled here among the lakes and frost in the 1880s . Indeed , the only thing more ubiquitous here than hockey rinks is the residue of red dust from the open-pit mines that stains roadways and the jeans of kids . " The mines have been going down for a while , " says Eino Phillips , who worked in the industry until he was 65 . " When a mine shuts down it affects the whole community and the whole area around it . " " One thing you can do when a mine shuts down is leave , which is what a lot of people have done . It 's what a lot of these people will do , too . " Indeed , modernization and globalization have taken their toll here . True , new machinery has made mining more productive , but it has also led to layoffs . Meanwhile , new processes and rich iron-ore deposits in other countries are drawing mining companies elsewhere . Since the late 1970s , the number of people working the mines has steadily declined from 16,000 to about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mining Company in Hoyt Lakes this spring will eliminate an additional 1,600 positions . There are hopes for a new buyer for the mine , that it can be retooled and remade into something else . But there is also a stoic kind of acceptance as well . Many former LTV employees have already left to find work in other mines . Mine work pays well , on average about $ 65,000 a year , and the workers here are n't ready to simply say goodbye to that kind of money . But even those who have n't found work at other mines are considering leaving the area only as a last resort . " Most of the people here are here because they want to be . Why else would you want to put up with 40 below and four feet of snow ? " says Jerry Fallos , president of the mine 's union , the United Steelworkers of America Local 4108 . " There is a lifestyle to the Range . There 's the hunting and fishing . It 's a good life , a wholesome life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the union , in construction and electrical work . Others have simply jumped at the chance of steady employment elsewhere . One 12-year LTV veteran left the mine to take work as a custodian , even though it meant a 50 percent pay cut . And though LTV has offered those who lose their jobs in Hoyt Lakes the opportunity to relocate to Cleveland or Chicago , there are few takers . " This is our life . This is our heritage , " Mr. Fallos says . Of course , change is not new on the Range . When a community builds its future on the riches of the soil , there is an understanding that at some point the land will run dry . And the Mesabi has been through crises before . " Throughout the history of mining here , people are always kind of waiting for the other shoe to drop , " says Ann Glumac , president of the Iron Mining Association of Minnesota . The mining industry was originally built on the raw ore that lay just beneath the soil . From the 1890s through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of iron ore in the United States . But the mining that fueled the Industrial Revolution and war effort left the area tapped of its raw iron reserves by the early 1950s . What saved the Range was taconite , the very hard rock that encases soft-ore deposits - and contains 20 to 30 percent iron . In the 1950s , a complicated process was developed to separate the iron from the rock . And it is this highly industrial process that the six big mines on the Range deal in today . There are few pickaxes and headlit helmets . Mining is done in open pits that resemble small-scale Grand Canyons with explosives , enormous vehicles , and massive , medieval-looking plant equipment - giant spiked crushers and mills . Taconite is literally blown out of the ground with an earth-shaking blast . Hundreds of tons of rock fragments are then loaded onto giant trucks and taken to mall-size factories . There , the rock is crushed , pounded , and milled until it comes out as a powder finer than flour . That powder is then put through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The iron is then wetted , mixed with clay and lime , and baked into marble-size pellets that are about 80 percent iron . The result is a consistent product that steelmakers like . The super-mechanized process , however , also leads to improvements that keep pushing workers out . Those changes led Minnesota to create the Iron Range Resources Rehabilitation Board , or IRRRB , to help find work for dislocated miners and bring new employers . Bill Woods has worked as a millwright at Minntac , the largest taconite mine in Minnesota , for 32 years . And he leads tours there now . The most poignant point : When he started , Minntac produced 14 million tons of pellets a year with 4,200 people . Now it produces 16 million tons with only 1,500 people . " The only way we can stay competitive in the world is to keep modernizing , " Mr. Woods says . Ironically , it may be modernization that leads to the decreased use of taconite and the closing of mines on the Range . New types of more efficient iron furnaces are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 200 million to build one such plant in Trinidad and Tobago . Considering all the changes the mining industry has been through here , one might think it would be best for the people living on the Range to find a new focus for their livelihood . But even if the area can completely retool its economy , the loss of iron mining will be felt . Mining is more than just a profession here . It has shaped the physical as well as the economic landscape . Hills and small mountains have been created by the red rock dug out of the open pit mines . And at Mineview in the Sky , a tourist sight that overlooks Virginia , the view in every direction is of red-stepped hills that were once mined themselves . The insular culture created by the mining life and its Scandinavian forebears has given the region a distinctive flavor . There is nary a Starbucks to be found in these parts , and the McDonald 's restaurants here are maybe the only ones in the world that feature a " Bratwurst Value Meal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may say Detroit was fueled by the auto industry or Pittsburgh was created by steel , but Hoyt Lakes was literally built by mining . When the mine opened in 1957 as the Erie Mining Co. , Erie created Hoyt Lakes out of whole cloth . It constructed the neat rows of Levittown-like houses , the schools , the shopping center . Now that the founding force is leaving , the future of the town - with its population of about 2,000 - is in question . Even before the announcement by LTV , the town was already in decline . When Fallos 's wife graduated from the Hoyt Lakes high school in 1976 , she was one of a class of 260 . Today , the high school does n't have enough players to field a football team . The state and the IRRRB have been trying to expand the area 's economic base by focusing on things like logging , tourism and phone " call centers " - a favorite for isolated communities . But providing new opportunities for miners and moving past the iron heritage are not easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearby Chisholm that employs 650 and pays about $ 11 an hour . " But I do n't see a lot of gruff miners that are going to answer phones , " says Fallos with a laugh . " It requires ... um ... different skills . " And some of the top tourist sites count on the mining ethos to attract visitors . One of the main features of the tourist trade here is Ironworld Discovery Center , which features interactive mining exhibits and an audio room where visitors can sit and listen to the stories of the settlers who came here for a life of mining . Another attraction , the Hull Rust Mine , is billed as " the biggest open-pit iron ore mine in the world . " If that were n't enough , across from Ironworld stands " Iron Man , " an 81-foot-high steel rendering of an iron miner standing atop steel beams . The uncertainty and the questions of what will happen next seem to linger beneath every conversation . At 2:30 p.m. on a Thursday , the Taconite Haven Lounge in Hoyt Lakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar talking about hockey and fishing , but there is little talk of the mine . Matt Sjoberg , who sits quietly , says the city will probably survive , but the area is forever changed . " When I moved here in ' 61 , this was a town of young people . Now , it 's a city of retirees , " says Mr. Sjoberg , who taught school in Hoyt Lakes for 34 years . He says his father always told him the mining game was a risky proposition and urged him to go into teaching . It is a lesson he passed on to his four kids , three of whom have moved away - the other works for the IRRRB . He still has one link to the mines , though , a brother-in-law who works at Minntac . But even he is not optimistic about what will happen in the near future . " He 's got about four years left before he gets his pension , and he just hopes he makes it , " Sjoberg says . Union man Fallos , who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services department , says he sees some hard months ahead . Workers are wondering how they will keep up their standard of living and pay for college for their kids , and they are coming by asking for help . It used to be three or four people a month . He now sees four or five people a week . Fallos 's son just began classes at Hibbing Community College , and the father has been steering his son away from a life in the mines . " At first he was talking about mining engineering , but I think the last 10 years have shown him how unstable it can be , " he says . " He 's looking at nuclear engineering now . " And even young Tom Calgaro has his doubts . " My dad said to consider electrical engineering because they are really respected at the mines , really well treated , " says the teen . " Even if I do n't end up at the mines , I could work for the power company or use the degree is some other way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2000 .
