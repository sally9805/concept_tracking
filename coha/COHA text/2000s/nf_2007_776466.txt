Blue Nines and Red Words // I was born on January 31 , 1979  --  a Wednesday . I know it was a Wednesday , because the date is blue in my mind and Wednesdays are always blue , like the number 9 or the sound of loud voices arguing . I like my birth date , because of the way I 'm able to visualize most of the numbers in it as smooth and round shapes , similar to pebbles on a beach . That 's because they are prime numbers : 31 , 19 , 197 , 97 , 79 and 1979 are all divisible only by themselves and 1 . I can recognize every prime up to 9,973 by their " pebble-like " quality . It 's just the way my brain works . // I have a rare condition known as savant syndrome , little known before its portrayal by actor Dustin Hoffman in the Oscar-winning 1988 film Rain Man . Like Hoffman 's character , Raymond Babbitt , I have an almost obsessive need for order and routine which affects virtually every aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 45 grams of porridge for breakfast each morning ; I weigh the bowl with an electronic scale to make sure . Then I count the number of items of clothing I 'm wearing before I leave my house . I get anxious if I ca n't drink my cups of tea at the same time each day . Whenever I become too stressed and I ca n't breathe properly , I close my eyes and count . Thinking of numbers helps me to become calm again . // Numbers are my friends , and they are always around me . Each one is unique and has its own personality . The number 11 is friendly and 5 is loud , whereas 4 is both shy and quiet  --  it 's my favorite number , perhaps because it reminds me of myself . Some are big  --  23 , 667 , 1,179  --  while others are small : 6 , 13 , 581 . Some are beautiful , like 333 , and some are ugly , like 289 . To me , every number is special . // No matter where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far from my thoughts . In an interview with talk show host David Letterman in New York , I told David he looked like the number 117  --  tall and lanky . Later outside , in the appropriately numerically named Times Square , I gazed up at the towering skyscrapers and felt surrounded by 9s  --  the number I most associate with feelings of immensity. // Scientists call my visual , emotional experience of numbers synesthesia , a rare neurological mixing of the senses , which most commonly results in the ability to see alphabetical letters and/or numbers in color . Mine is an unusual and complex type , through which I see numbers as shapes , colors , textures and motions . The number 1 , for example , is a brilliant and bright white , like someone shining a flashlight into my eyes . Five is a clap of thunder or the sound of waves crashing against rocks . Thirty-seven is lumpy like porridge , while 89 reminds me of falling snow . // Probably the most famous case of synesthesia was the one written up over a period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. R. Luria of a journalist called Shereshevsky with a prodigious memory . " S , " as Luria called him in his notes for the book The Mind of a Mnemonist , had a highly visual memory which allowed him to " see " words and numbers as different shapes and colors . " S " was able to remember a matrix of 50 digits after studying it for three minutes , both immediately afterwards and many years later . Luria credited Shereshevsky 's synesthetic experiences as the basis for his remarkable short- and long-term memory . // Using my own synesthetic experiences since early childhood , I have grown up with the ability to handle and calculate huge numbers in my head without any conscious effort , just like the Raymond Babbitt character . In fact , this is a talent common to several other real-life savants ( sometimes referred to as " lightning calculators " ) . Dr. Darold Treffert , a Wisconsin physician and the leading researcher in the study of savant syndrome , gives one example , of a blind man with " a faculty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his book Extraordinary People : // When he was asked how many grains of corn there would be in any one of 64 boxes , with 1 in the first , 2 in the second , 4 in the third , 8 in the fourth , and so on , he gave answers for the fourteenth ( 8,192 ) , for the eighteenth ( 131,072 ) and the twenty-fourth ( 8,388,608 ) instantaneously , and he gave the figures for the forty-eighth box ( 140,737,488,355,328 ) in six seconds . He also gave the total in all 64 boxes correctly ( 18,446,744,073,709,551 , 616 ) in forty-five seconds . // My favorite kind of calculation is power multiplication , which means multiplying a number by itself a specified number of times . Multiplying a number by itself is called squaring ; for example , the square of 72 is 72 x 72 = 5,184 . Squares are always symmetrical shapes in my mind , which makes them especially beautiful to me . Multiplying the same number three times over is called cubing or " raising " to the third power . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equivalent to 51 x 51 x 51 = 132,651 . I see each result of a power multiplication as a distinctive visual pattern in my head . As the sums and their results grow , so the mental shapes and colors I experience become increasingly more complex . I see 37 's fifth power  --  37 x 37 x 37 x 37 x 37 = 69,343,957  --  as a large circle composed of smaller circles running clockwise from the top around . // When I divide one number by another , in my head I see a spiral rotating downwards in larger and larger loops , which seem to warp and curve . Different divisions produce different sizes of spirals with varying curves . From my mental imagery I 'm able to calculate a sum like 13 ? 97 ( 0.1340206 ... ) to almost a hundred decimal places . // I never write anything down when I 'm calculating , because I 've always been able to do the sums in my head , and it 's much easier for me to visualize the answer using my synesthetic shapes than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ techniques taught in the textbooks we are given at school . When multiplying , I see the two numbers as distinct shapes . The image changes and a third shape emerges  --  the correct answer . The process takes a matter of seconds and happens spontaneously . It 's like doing math without having to think . // Different tasks involve different shapes , and I also have various sensations or emotions for certain numbers . Whenever I multiply with 11 I always experience a feeling of the digits tumbling downwards in my head . I find 6s hardest to remember of all the numbers , because I experience them as tiny black dots , without any distinctive shape or texture . I would describe them as like little gaps or holes . I have visual and sometimes emotional responses to every number up to 10,000 , like having my own visual , numerical vocabulary . And just like a poet 's choice of words , I find some combinations of numbers more beautiful than others : ones go well with darker numbers like 8s and 9s , but not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 189 is much more beautiful to me than one with a sequence like 116. // This aesthetic dimension to my synesthesia is something that has its ups and downs . If I see a number I experience as particularly beautiful on a shop sign or a car license plate , there 's a shiver of excitement and pleasure . On the other hand , if the numbers do n't match my experience of them  --  if , for example , a shop sign 's price has " 99 pence " in red or green ( instead of blue )  --  then I find that uncomfortable and irritating . // It is not known how many savants have synesthetic experiences to help them in the areas they excel in . One reason for this is that , like Raymond Babbitt , many suffer profound disability , preventing them from explaining to others how they do the things that they do . I am fortunate not to suffer from any of the most severe impairments that often come with abilities such as mine . // Like most individuals with savant syndrome , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's syndrome , a relatively mild and high-functioning form of autism that affects around 1 in every 300 people in the United Kingdom . According to a 2001 study by the U.K. 's National Autistic Society , nearly half of all adults with Asperger 's syndrome are not diagnosed until after the age of sixteen . I was finally diagnosed at age twenty-five following tests and an interview at the Autism Research Centre in Cambridge . // Autism , including Asperger 's syndrome , is defined by the presence of impairments affecting social interaction , communication , and imagination ( problems with abstract or flexible thought and empathy , for example ) . Diagnosis is not easy and can not be made by a blood test or brain scan ; doctors have to observe behavior and study the individual 's developmental history from infancy . // People with Asperger 's often have good language skills and are able to lead relatively normal lives . Many have above-average IQs and excel in areas that involve logical or visual thinking . Like other forms of autism , Asperger 's is a condition affecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autistics and 90 percent of those diagnosed with Asperger 's are men ) . Single-mindedness is a defining characteristic , as is a strong drive to analyze detail and identify rules and patterns in systems . Specialized skills involving memory , numbers , and mathematics are common . It is not known for certain what causes someone to have Asperger 's , though it is something you are born with . // For as long as I can remember , I have experienced numbers in the visual , synesthetic way that I do . Numbers are my first language , one I often think and feel in . Emotions can be hard for me to understand or know how to react to , so I often use numbers to help me . If a friend says they feel sad or depressed , I picture myself sitting in the dark hollowness of number 6 to help me experience the same sort of feeling and understand it . If I read in an article that a person felt intimidated by something , I imagine myself standing next to the number 9 . Whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerical landscapes and how happy they make me feel inside . By doing this , numbers actually help me get closer to understanding other people . // Sometimes people I meet for the first time remind me of a particular number and this helps me to be comfortable around them . They might be very tall and remind me of the number 9 , or round and remind me of the number 3 . If I feel unhappy or anxious or in a situation I have no previous experience of ( when I 'm much more likely to feel stressed and uncomfortable ) , I count to myself . When I count , the numbers form pictures and patterns in my mind that are consistent and reassuring to me . Then I can relax and interact with whatever situation I 'm in. // Thinking of calendars always makes me feel good , all those numbers and patterns in one place . Different days of the week elicit different colors and emotions in my head : Tuesdays are a warm color while Thursdays are fuzzy . Calendrical calculation  --  the ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or will fall on  --  is common to many savants . I think this is probably due to the fact that the numbers in calendars are predictable and form patterns between the different days and months . For example , the thirteenth day in a month is always two days before whatever day the first falls on , excepting leap years , while several of the months mimic the behavior of others , like January and October , September and December , and February and March ( the first day of February is the same as the first day of March ) . So if the first of February is a fuzzy texture in my mind ( Thursday ) for a given year , the thirteenth of March will be a warm color ( Tuesday ) . // In his book T he Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat , writer and neurologist Oliver Sacks mentions the case of severely autistic twins John and Michael as an example of how far some savants are able to take calendrical calculations . Though unable to care for themselves ( they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the twins were capable of calculating the day of the week for any date over a 40,000-year span . // Sacks also describes John and Michael as playing a game that involved swapping prime numbers with each other for hours at a time . Like the twins , I have always been fascinated by prime numbers . I see each prime as a smooth-textured shape , distinct from composite numbers ( non-primes ) that are grittier and less distinctive . Whenever I identify a number as prime , I get a rush of feeling in my head ( in the front center ) which is hard to put into words . It 's a special feeling , like the sudden sensation of pins and needles . // Sometimes I close my eyes and imagine the first thirty , fifty , hundred numbers as I experience them spatially , synesthetically . Then I can see in my mind 's eye just how beautiful and special the primes are by the way they stand out so sharply from the other number shapes . It 's exactly for this reason that I look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so different from the one before and the one after . Their loneliness among the other numbers makes them so conspicuous and interesting to me. // There are moments , as I 'm falling into sleep at night , that my mind fills suddenly with bright light and all I can see are numbers  --  hundreds , thousands of them  --  swimming rapidly over my eyes . The experience is beautiful and soothing to me . Some nights , when I 'm having difficulty falling asleep , I imagine myself walking around my numerical landscapes . Then I feel safe and happy . I never feel lost , because the prime number shapes act as signposts. // Mathematicians , too , spend a lot of time thinking about prime numbers , in part because there is no quick or simple method for testing a number to see whether or not it is prime . The best known is called " the Sieve of Eratosthenes " after an ancient Greek scholar , Eratosthenes of Cyrene . The sieve method works in this way : Write out the numbers you want to test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1 is neither prime nor composite ) , cross out every second number : 4 , 6 , 8 ... up to 100 . Then move to 3 and cross out every third number : 6 , 9 , 12 ... then move to four and cross out every fourth number : 8 , 12 , 16 ... and so on , until you are left with only a few numbers that do not ever get crossed out : 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 11 , 13 , 17 , 19 , 23 , 29 , 31 ... These are the prime numbers ; the building blocks of my numerical world . // My synesthesia also affects how I perceive words and language . The word ladder , for example , is blue and shiny , while hoop is a soft , white word . The same thing happens when I read words in other languages : jardin , the French word for " garden , " is a blurred yellow , while hnugginn  --  Icelandic for " sad "  --  is white with lots of blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to obtain their colors from the initial letter of the word , and this is generally true for me : yogurt is a yellow word , video is purple ( perhaps linked with violet ) and gate is green . I can even make the color of a word change by mentally adding initial letters to turn the word into another : at is a red word , but add the letter H to get hat and it becomes a white word . If I then add a letter T to make that , the word 's color is now orange . Not all words fit the initial-letter pattern : words beginning with the letter A , for example , are always red and those beginning with W are always dark blue . // Some words are perfect fits for the things they describe . A raspberry is both a red word and a red fruit , while grass and glass are both green words that describe green things . Words beginning with the letter T are always orange like a tulip or a tiger or a tree in autumn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some words do not seem to me to fit the things they describe : geese is a green word but describes white birds ( heese would seem a better choice to me ) , the word white is blue while orange is clear and shiny like ice . Four is a blue word but a pointy number , at least to me . The color of wine ( a blue word ) is better described by the French word vin , which is purple . // Seeing words in different colors and textures aids my memory for facts and names . For example , I remember that the winning cyclist of each stage of the Tour de France wins a yellow jersey ( not green or red or blue ) , because the word jersey is yellow to me . Similarly , I can remember that Finland 's national flag has a blue cross ( on a white background ) because the word Finland is blue ( as are all words beginning with the letter F ) . When I meet someone for the first time I often remember their name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Johns are yellow , and Henrys are white . // It also helps me to learn other languages quickly and easily . I currently know ten languages : English ( my native language ) , Finnish , French , German , Lithuanian , Esperanto , Spanish , Romanian , Icelandic and Welsh . Associating the different colors and emotions I experience for each word with its meaning helps bring the words to life . For example , the Finnish word tuli is orange to me and means " fire . " When I read or think about the word I immediately see the color in my head , which evokes the meaning . Another example is the Welsh word gweilgi , which is a green and dark blue color and means " sea . " I think it is an extremely good word for describing the sea 's colors . Then there is the Icelandic word r ? kkur , which means " twilight " or " dusk . " It is a crimson word and when I see it , it makes me think of a blood red sunset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of my frequent trips to the local library , spending hours looking at book after book trying in vain to find one that had my name on it . Because there were so many books in the library , with so many different names on them , I 'd assumed that one of them  --  somewhere  --  had to be mine . I did n't understand at the time that a person 's name appears on a book because he or she wrote it . Now that I 'm twenty-six I know better . If I were ever going to find my book one day , I was going to have to write it first . // Writing about my life has given me the opportunity to get some perspective on just how far I 've come , and to trace the arc of my journey up to the present . If someone had told my parents ten years ago that I would be living completely independently , with a loving relationship and a career , I do n't think they would have believed it and I 'm not sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how I got there . // My younger brother Steven has recently been diagnosed with the same form of high-functioning autism that I have . At nineteen , he is going through a lot of the challenges that I too faced while growing up , from problems with anxiety and loneliness to uncertainty about the future . When I was a child , doctors did not know about Asperger 's syndrome ( it was not recognized as a unique disorder until 1994 ) and so for many years I grew up with no understanding of why I felt so different from my peers and apart from the world around me . By writing about my own experiences of growing up on the autistic spectrum , it is my hope that I can help other young people living with high-functioning autism , like my brother Steven , to feel less isolated and to have confidence in the knowledge that it is ultimately possible to lead a happy and productive life . I 'm living proof of that . //              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
