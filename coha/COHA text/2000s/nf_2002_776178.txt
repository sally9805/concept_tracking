WHY THEY HATE US America and Its Enemies // * * * // The cry that comes from the heart of the believer // overcomes everything , even the White House . //  --  Ayatollah Khomeini // Before the terrorists destroyed the World Trade Center , crashed a plane into the Pentagon , and began their campaign to bring to America the horrors of the war-ravaged Middle East , life in the United States was placid and even a little boring . The dominant issue in politics was the Social Security lockbox , an especially curious subject of dispute since no such lockbox exists or has ever existed . For diversion and entertainment , Americans could follow the Gary Condit sex scandal or watch " reality TV " shows like Survivor . Newspapers devoted front-page reports to such issues as road rage , a man bitten by a shark , and the revelation that overage kids were playing Little League baseball . The biggest issue in the airline industry involved something called " economy class syndrome . " Essentially this referred to rather obese people sitting in coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiff . // All this triviality and absurdity was swept aside by the hijackers . In an act of supreme chutzpah , coordination , and technical skill , nineteen men seized control of four commercial jet planes , crashed two into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center , and rammed one into the shoulder of the Pentagon . The fourth plane did not find its target  --  possibly the White House or Camp David  --  but crashed into the woods of Pennsylvania . In a single day of infamy  --  September 11 , 2001  --  the terrorists had killed more than three thousand people . // Not since Pearl Harbor , which provoked American entry into World War II , had America been directly attacked in this way by a foreign power . But even that was different . Pearl Harbor is in Hawaii , not on the American mainland . Moreover , the attack on Pearl Harbor was a military operation directed against the U.S. Navy . By contrast , the terrorists struck New York City , and most of the people they killed were civilians . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Civil War , to count such large numbers of American casualties on a single day . As for civilian casualties , the citizens of the United States had never endured such mayhem . Historian David McCullough called September 11 , 2001 , the worst day in America 's history . // Now , amidst our grief and sad memories , we find ourselves at war against the forces of terrorism . It is an overt war , such as we saw in the overthrow of the Taliban regime , as well as a covert war , with secret campaigns to identify and destroy enemy networks and cells . It is a war that has come home to America , as people cope with fears of further attacks , including those involving biological , chemical , and  --  God forbid  --  nuclear weapons . Moreover , this is a new kind of war against an enemy that refuses to identify himself . Our enemy is a terrorist regime that inhabits many countries , including the United States . It is made up of very strange people most of whose names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain unclear to us . And the enemy conducts its operations in the name of Islam , one of the world 's great religions and a very old civilization that has somehow now become an incubator of fanaticism and terrorism . // * * * // Know your enemy , Clausewitz instructs us , and then you will be able to fight him . Despite our early success in Afghanistan , it is not clear that we understand our enemy very well . Indeed , America 's incomprehension of the enemy became apparent in the days immediately following September 11 , with the insistence of our leaders and pundits that the terrorists were " cowards " or " faceless cowards . " President Bush first used this term , which was then repeated by many others . The reasoning is that the terrorists cravenly targeted women and children . But of course the terrorists did no such thing . They did n't really care who was on the hijacked planes or in the World Trade Center . As it happened , most of their victims were men . Their targets were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of them was the Pentagon , by any reckoning a military target . Usually we consider people who pick on women and children cowardly because they are trying to avoid harm to themselves . But in this case the terrorists went to their deaths with certainty and apparent equanimity . Like the Japanese kamikazes , the terrorists were certainly fanatical , but cowards they were not . // A second enduring myth about the terrorists is that they were poor , miserable souls who performed these terrible actions because they were desperate or more likely insane . Several commentators argued that the terrorists are drawn from " the wretched of the earth . " In this view , they strike out against the affluent West because they have nothing to live for . Television host Bill O'Reilly carried this logic even further . He could not consider the terrorists brave , O'Reilly said , because they labored under the illusion that they were going straight to heaven , where they would be attended by countless nubile virgins . This , in O'Reilly 's view , was simply " nuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the facts . Indeed , it is irrational and reckless to dismiss the terrorists in this way . O'Reilly 's lunacy theory can be tested by releasing a bunch of mentally handicapped people from one of our asylums . Could they have pulled off what the terrorists did ? Of course not . The unnerving reality is that the terrorists were educated people who knew how to fly planes . They had lived in the West and been exposed to the West . Some of them , like Muhammad Atta , were raised in secular households . Many came from well-off families . Indeed , the ringleader , Osama bin Laden , had a reported net worth of more than $100 million . Normally men with bin Laden 's bank account can be found in Monaco or St. Tropez , sailing yachts with beautiful women on each arm . Bin Laden , by contrast , spent the past several years living in a cave in Afghanistan . // What motivates such men ? One vital clue is the diary composed by Muhammad Atta and circulated to the other terrorists prior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment . Out of respect for Allah , it says , clean your body , shave off excess hair , wear cologne , and " tighten your shoes . " Read the Koran and " pray through the night " in order to " purify your soul from all unclean things . " Try and detach yourself from this world because " the time for play is over . " Keep a steadfast mind because " anything that happens to you could never be avoided , and what did not happen to you could never have happened to you . " On the morning of the attack , " pray the morning prayer " and " do not leave your apartment unless you have performed ablution . " Pray as you enter the plane and recite verses from the Koran . Ask God to forgive your sins and to give you the victory . Clench your teeth as you prepare for the attack . Shout " Allahu Akbar . " Strike your enemy above the neck , as the Koran instructs . Moreover , " if you slaughter , do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is one of the practices of the prophet , peace be upon him . " Finally , " You should feel complete tranquility , because the time between you and your marriage in heaven is very short . " // These are not the instructions of cowards or lunatics , but of deeply religious Muslims . They were armed with an idea , and their colleagues have the weapons , the strategy , and the ruthlessness that are required to take on the United States and the West . It is a mistake to regard them as " suicides " in the traditional sense . A suicidal person is one who does not want to live . These men wanted to live , but they were prepared to give their life for something they deemed higher . This in itself is not contemptible or ridiculous ; indeed , it raises the question of what we in America would be willing to give our lives for . No serious patriotism is possible that does not attempt to answer that question . // It is difficult for those of us who live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willingly  --  even happily  --  give their lives for their faith . When a few people show such tendencies , we deem them extremists ; when large numbers of people do , we convince ourselves that they have been brainwashed . They say they are acting in the name of Allah , but we insist that this is not their real motive ; they are being manipulated by elites . They believe they are martyrs , but we pronounce that they are not really Muslims . President Bush even suggested that they were betraying their faith . British prime minister Tony Blair has said he regrets the term " Islamic terrorists " because the vast majority of Muslims are not terrorists . // True Islam , many pundits noted , is a religion of peace . As Nada El Sawy , an Arab-American , wrote in Newsweek , " Muslims who kill in the name of their beliefs are not true Muslims . " Advocates of this position point out that the term jihad does not mean " holy war " : it refers to a moral struggle to conquer the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving force behind the attacks , what was ? The New Yorker comfortingly concluded , " This is a conflict that pits all of civilized society against a comparatively small , essentially stateless band of murderous outlaws. " // These statements may have been made for the political purpose of isolating the terrorists and keeping together an alliance against terrorism that includes several Muslim countries . But they are profoundly misleading . Political unity is important , but so is mental clarity and honesty . If we misunderstand what is driving our enemy , then our strategy in fighting him is likely to be inadequate . Despite the early success of the U.S. military campaign , it is not clear that America has a well-conceived long-term strategy for getting rid of terrorism . Moreover , honesty , together with an informed sense of history , obliges us to admit that the things that we have been saying about Islam are half-truths , and dangerous half-truths at that . // Tony Blair is right that the vast majority of Muslims are not terrorists , but it is equally a fact that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the states that the U.S. government classifies as " terrorist " or " rogue " states , such as Iraq , Iran , Syria , Libya , and the Sudan , fall within the Muslim world . While Americans insist that the terrorists are fringe figures  --  similar perhaps to our Ku Klux Klan  --  the evidence is that they enjoy considerable support in their part of the globe . Immediately following the attack , bin Laden became a folk hero in the Islamic world . The actions of the terrorists were cheered in Iraq , Libya , and among many supporters of the Palestine Liberation Organization . In Gaza , for example , a poll showed that 78 percent of Palestinians supported the attacks . Another poll showed that 83 percent of Pakistanis sympathize with bin Laden 's al Qaeda group and oppose the United States ' military response . Even the governments of Muslim countries that are allied with the U.S. in the war against terrorism have proved very reluctant to involve themselves in the fighting . Nor have the leading authorities of any Muslim country condemned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // The reason for such waffling is that our allies know that terrorism and anti-Americanism have substantial support among the population in the Islamic world , even in so-called moderate Arab countries . Virtually the entire Muslim world has , over the past few decades , experienced a religious resurgence  --  what we may term the revival of Islamic fundamentalism . The authority of the fundamentalists is not confined to a few countries , such as Iran and the Sudan . Of the twenty-two nations of the Muslim world , none is exempt from fundamentalist influence . This movement is powerful enough , in numbers and in political intensity , to threaten the stability of countries allied with the United States , like Pakistan , Egypt , and Saudi Arabia . Indeed , the leadership of those countries is constantly on the defensive against the militants ; it is they  --  not the terrorists or the militants  --  who are under suspicion for betraying Islam . // The terrorists and their supporters do n't have to prove their bona fides . They do what they do in the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Some Muslims , especially in the modern era , understand jihad as a form of internal warfare in the soul against sin . But the Koran itself urges Muslims to " slay the idolaters wherever you find them . Seize them , besiege them , and lie in ambush everywhere for them . " In his classic work , The Muqaddimah , the influential Muslim writer Ibn Khaldun asserts , " In the Muslim community , holy war is a religious duty , because of the obligation to convert everybody to Islam either by persuasion or by force . " These passages convey how Muslims themselves have usually understood their religious mission . Historian Bernard Lewis writes that the traditional Islamic view , upheld by the vast majority of jurists and commentators , is that jihad usually refers to an armed struggle against infidels and apostates . Lewis writes : // In the Muslim worldview the basic division of mankind is into the House of Islam ( Dar al-Islam ) and the House of War ( Dar al-Harb ) . Ideally the House of Islam is conceived as a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not recognize the permanent existence of any other polity outside Islam . In time , in the Muslim view , all mankind will accept Islam or submit to Islamic rule . A treaty of peace between the Muslim state and a non-Muslim state was thus in theory impossible . Such a truce , according to the jurists , could only be provisional . The name given by the Muslim jurists to this struggle is jihad . // The clear implication of Lewis 's remarks is that the terrorists who profess the name of Allah and proclaim jihad are operating squarely within the Islamic tradition . Indeed , they are performing what Islam has typically held to be a religious duty . Of course it could be pointed out that there are millions of Muslims who do not agree with this view of Islam . They prefer what may be termed the " jihad of the heart " or perhaps the " jihad of the pen " to the " jihad of the sword . " But traditionally Islam has embraced all these forms of jihad as legitimate , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both in the West and in the Islamic world , no longer profess Islam in its traditional sense . In a word , they are liberals , not in the Michael Dukakis connotation , but in the classic meaning of the term . From the point of view of the bin Ladens of the world , these people are apostates for diluting the faith and refusing to do battle against the infidels. // I realize that terms like " apostate " and " infidel " sound harshly unfamiliar to the Western ear . There is something strange and antique about them , as if they belong to the world of our ancestors . And of course they do . A thousand years ago , during the time of the Crusades , the ancestors of the West understood their Islamic foe very well . Nobody spoke of " the West " at that time ; they spoke of " Christendom . " It was a time , one may say , when the Christians , too , had their jihad , and it was aimed at the reconquest of the Holy Land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pilgrimage and holy war . Kings and popes alike proclaimed that those who died in battle were martyrs for the faith and would go straight to heaven . // ( Continues ... ) //
