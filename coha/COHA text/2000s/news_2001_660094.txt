<p> In one corner : " Gladiator , " full of firmly strapped sandals and swords tightly clutched by muscular arms that ca n't wait to take a swipe at an enemy , an adversary - or the camera itself if it gets in the way . Not since the 1959 classic " Ben-Hur " has such an all-stops-out action epic so dominated the Academy Awards fight - at least if you discount " Braveheart , " an unexpected victor that Oscar voters are still scratching their heads over . Speculation is fierce as pundits wonder if the same academy that recently honored " American Beauty " and " Shakespeare in Love " will now bestow its laurels on one of the most bone-crunching entertainments in recent memory . It 's a hard question that might stump an ancient Roman philosopher , but the movie 's whopping 12 nominations provide a pretty good clue . In the other corner : " Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon , " sporting colorful Chinese costumes and the most dancelike fight scenes this side of a Hong Kong martial-arts festival - with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaping among leafy boughs with a physical grace that Western superheroes like Batman and Superman could n't begin to master . Will the academy forget its proud Hollywood roots , its general aversion to subtitles , and its longtime preference for homegrown productions - and allow an overseas visitor to sweep the Oscar race ? It 's a hard question that might stump a wise Asian mystic , but the movie 's impressive 10 nominations point to a possible answer . Until the Oscar nominations were unveiled last month , few observers expected this unpredictable face-off between two action pictures of such very different types . To be sure , the Gladiator vs. the Tiger is not the only interesting angle in the sweepstakes . Races in many important categories are wide open , or at least too close to call with any degree of confidence . This will lend an unusual amount of suspense to Sunday night 's parade of celebrities chanting , " The envelope , please ... " But let 's face it : The evolving fortunes of Ridley Scott 's sword-and-sandal extravaganza and Ang Lee 's literate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oscar broadcast as it takes its meandering course . And the overall result of the race could raise some fascinating questions . If the gut-wrenching " Gladiator " wins , does this mean Hollywood genuinely respects the craft and artistry that went into it ? Or does it mean academy voters like to take the easy way out , keeping their major kudos in their own backyard ? Are they ready for a picture like " Tiger , " which stretches the imagination with regard to everything from its cinematic style to its philosophy of life ? And conversely , is the offbeat " Tiger " doomed from the start - admired for its clever blending of exoticism and entertainment , but ultimately too different from the easy-to-absorb artifice that Hollywood loves to celebrate ? A look through academy history suggests a few tentative answers . One finding that could work against both " Gladiator " and " Tiger " is that action pictures traditionally have n't won . True , the very first best-picture Oscar went to the World War I adventure " Wings " in 1928 , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the action genre - the moody " From Here to Eternity " and David Lean 's intelligent " The Bridge on the River Kwai " in the ' 50s , for instance . The number rises even more if you count thoughtful gangster melodramas like Francis Ford Coppola 's first two " Godfather " installments , which were named best picture in 1972 and 1974 , respectively . And then there 's the closest " Gladiator " model , " Ben-Hur , " which was nominated for the same number of awards as " Gladiator " in the very same categories - a coincidence , perhaps , but a telling one , especially since the 1959 hit swept no fewer than 11 of the dozen prizes it contended for . " Ben-Hur 's " action-movie status may actually have helped its historic victory , since the pictures it defeated came from very different categories : the thriller " Anatomy of a Murder , " the much-loved " Diary of Anne Frank , " and the fondly received dramas " Room at the Top " and " The Nun 's Story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blades , speeding chariots , and he-manly combat over a diverse array of other possibilities . Still , action for its own sake has n't been especially high among Oscar 's priorities over the years . And this raises doubts about the glitz-and-glitter image traditionally linked with Hollywood in general and the Academy Awards in particular . <p> Breaking out of the mold Some people assume that the Oscars inevitably gravitate toward superficial show-biz entertainment , with box-office profitability as the primary reference point . But is that view too simple ? Does the academy swing out of the mere-entertainment mold from time to time , honoring movies that broaden audiences ' horizons and expand the boundaries of cinema itself ? The answer seems to be a highly qualified yes . On one hand , truly audacious and experimental films tend to be passed over for best-picture nominations , even when adventurous moviegoers embrace them . Think of Stanley Kubrick 's mind-bending " 2001 : A Space Odyssey " in 1968 , which competed in creative categories like writing and directing , but failed to score a best-picture nomination . Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musical " Nashville " and Martin Scorsese 's brutal 1976 masterpiece " Taxi Driver , " did garner best-picture nominations , but lost to more crowd-pleasing fare - the feisty " One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest " and the boxing bonanza " Rocky , " respectively . In these and numerous other cases , the academy paid its respects to movies that opened up new concepts of what cinema can be . But when the final votes were counted , this enthusiasm proved to have limits : While truly distinctive pictures are allowed into the race from time to time , they 're usually also-rans in the last analysis . If this pattern holds up Sunday night , look for " Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon " to fare well in secondary races , but expect " Gladiator " to squelch it in the climactic best-picture category , and perhaps in the total number of Oscars it receives . Action-movie snobbery It 's possible that another contender will edge out both of them , of course , especially if the academy reverts to its traditional snobbery toward the action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romance like " Chocolat , " a serious political picture like " Traffic , " or a human-interest drama like " Erin Brockovich " turning the tables on such feisty competitors - especially since a Julia Roberts best-actress win for " Brockovich " is widely considered all but inevitable , allowing voters to swing in other directions on their best-picture ballots . Even if " Gladiator " sweeps the evening , though , the prominence of " Crouching Tiger " in the race will have raised an invigorating possibility , suggesting that Hollywood is becoming less parochial than it has seemed in recent years and may be returning to a more cosmopolitan and even international outlook . A few decades ago , non-American films competed quite often for the best-picture prize - think of " Cries and Whispers " and " The Emigrants " in the ' 70s , and " Z " and " Tom Jones " in the ' 60s , for example . If such an atmosphere takes root again in Hollywood , much of the credit must go to the excitement generated there by " Crouching Tiger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Asian imagery , and an approach to action-movie violence that could n't be more different from the big-studio norm . Even if it loses , " Crouching Tiger " could be the not-so-hidden dragon that reminds American moviemakers of how much they can learn from new ideas and old ideals nurtured far from Hollywood 's soundstages . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2001 .
