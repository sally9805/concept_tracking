<p> Fall might seem like the perfect season for nostalgia , but when it comes to musical backward glances , it 's all about summer . <p> Over the next four months , more than 50 acts that had their first hits in the 1980s or earlier will play in the Atlanta area . Heck , even ' 90s nostalgia is already taking root  --  grunge-lite Seattle band Candlebox is back together and hitting the road . <p> This musical nostalgia stuff is big business . According to concert industry trade publication Pollstar 's year-end stats for 2005 , more than 30 of the top 100 moneymaking tours of the year were artists whose careers began more than 20 years ago , including the entire top five . <p> Some of the bands have never stopped , but others have re-formed , often without some of the key members that made those hits you remember . <p> So who are these people calling themselves Foreigner or the New Cars ? Let 's take a look . <p> THE NEW CARS <p> The hits : " Shake It Up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What I Needed , " " Drive " and nine more Top 40 entries between 1978 and 1987 . <p> Percentage of original members remaining : 40% <p> Who they were : Ric Ocasek and Benjamin Orr were the guys out front , along with guitarist Elliot Easton , keyboard man Greg Hawkes and drummer David Robinson .

" He was replaced by two new members , Frank Infante and Nigel Harrison , before the release of the band 's breakthrough " Parallel Lines . " There 's no mention of those three in the biography on the official Blondie Web site and , judging by Deborah Harry 's unwelcoming reaction to Harrison and Infante 's appearance at her band 's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , they are persona non grata . Not surprising , since those two filed a lawsuit attempting to rejoin the re-formed Blondie . <p> Who they are : Harry , Chris Stein , Jimmy Destri and , crucially , drummer extraordinaire Clem Burke , all present on the band 's 1976 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one has heard of , and you have Blondie 2006 . <p> When and where : With the New Cars . 7 p.m .
