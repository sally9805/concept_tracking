Prime Minister Ariel Sharon 's withdrawal from Israel 's 21 Gaza settlements proceeded far more smoothly than many security assessments had anticipated . Despite scenes of defiance and anguish as 43,000 soldiers and police began to clear the 8,700 settlers and their supporters from the areas , there was little violence and few serious injuries . As a result , it is Mahmoud Abbas , the Palestinian President , who now faces the biggest political risk . <P> With the settlers carted off to hotels all over Israel or to temporary homes built by the government on sand dunes near the town of Ashkelon , Israel will first salvage metal and other materials before destroying the settlements ' houses . Much of the rubble will be used to build breakwaters for a new Palestinian port south of Gaza City . Even before the land is cleared , the question is , Who gets the spoils ? <P> The Islamists of Hamas , who oppose Abbas , claim it was their long war in Gaza that pushed out the Israelis , and want payback in the form of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will come under Palestinian control when the last Israeli soldiers leave ( they 're scheduled to depart in six weeks ) . Hamas wants to build low-income housing on the land to bolster popular support in advance of parliamentary elections set for January . Its leaders are casting Hamas as a national , rather than a purely Islamic , party that can beat Abbas ' corrupt and unpopular Fatah party at the polls . If Abbas does n't give Hamas some land  --  and his aides say the settlement territory will indeed be held by the government  --  Hamas says it will take what it wants by force . <P> The group 's military chiefs are also threatening to strike against Israel to drive it out of the West Bank the way they claim they pushed it out of Gaza . Abbas ' security brass is n't obeying his orders , making it hard for him to face down the Islamists and ensuring that he 'll fall short of Sharon 's demand for a complete end to violence . If Hamas gets a free hand in Gaza and its homemade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in trouble  --  he faces party primaries in the spring and an election next fall . For both leaders , the withdrawal from Gaza is only a beginning .
