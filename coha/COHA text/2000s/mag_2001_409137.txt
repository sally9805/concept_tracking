Section : Methods AND Materials <p> When it comes to densely layered pastels , many artists immediately think of Edgar Degas and how he captured seemingly unposed moments with these sticks of pigment . Up close , his paintings reveal layers of different-colored strokes applied in a variety of directions . Throughout the years , critics and artists alike have speculated about the technique Degas used to layer pastel , and their hypotheses have ranged from homemade fixative to steaming the work to set the pigments for successive layers . <p> Margaret Dyer of Carrollton , Georgia , believes she knows how to create pastel paintings with the same vibrancy as Degas ' . " The thing that impresses me most about Degas is how he controlled the values of the darks and lights , " says Dyer . " In my own works I follow this example and find success comes almost naturally . My recipe is simple and unchanging . In fact , it 's when I deviate from this recipe that I sometimes fail . " <p> Dyer thinks about values from the moment she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few gesture sketches and develops the best one into a stronger drawing . The artist then proceeds through three stages , one for each main value : darks , middle tones , and lights . " First I delineate the darks by massing them in and building them up with really intense , deep colors , " she explains . " I like to use purple , dark brown , and forest green for this , and my goal is to make sure that  --  as much as possible  --  all the dark colors are the same value . " She goes on to the middle values , such as coral , sea green , and peach , and finishes with the light colors , such as pale lemon yellow , pale blue , and pale pink . " This is exactly what Degas did , isolating the darks and middle tones , " Dyer comments . " In any one value range I can put in an unlimited number of colors . When I follow that recipe I have a successful , strong painting . If I mix different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mud . " <p> Dyer uses the softest pastels she can find , and she chooses her colors based on intuition and a general sense of warm and cool . " I may start delineating the figure with a purple , but my next impulse might be to reach for a green , " she comments . " Next , I may want to use a color on the opposite side of the color wheel so I 'll choose a brownish orange , but one that is just as dark as the first two colors . When I apply a color , I just take it and fill in the area . Then I take a second one and , in effect , glaze it by lightly rubbing the side over the first color . I do n't want to obliterate what I 've already put down , and I want a look of translucency . For example , on a skin tone I never use what some people call flesh color . Instead I use greens and lavenders . People question how I can get those colors to look like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The different colors neutralize each other and optically mix to the right color . " <p> Rather than using fixative between layers , Dyer works on a prepared ground . " When I first started layering pastels , the paper I used would reach a point where it would n't take any more pastel , " she notes . " At that point , I would spray fixative on the area and continue . Now , however , I work on a special pastel paper . It 's toned with a middle-value olive green or gray and covered with a fine grit surface that does n't lose its tooth . " <p> The excitement in Dyer 's work is due in part to the limited time she spends on each painting , only about an hour or two . For added excitement , she applies random strokes or scribbles of other colors to an area . After she applies a color , she leaves it alone and never blends , which she believes negatively affects the vibrancy . Just like Degas ' pastels , her works are realistic from a distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> At her studio on Balboa Island , California , Debra Huse takes a different approach to layering pastels . She began thinking seriously about layering when she determined her pastel paintings were not as rich as she wanted them to be . " Many people have a perception of pastel paintings as being soft with fuzzy edges , but I think that is how works get muddy , " she says . " When I gave up rubbing the pastels with my finger or any sort of tool , they immediately became bolder . At that point I also found that the more I layered my pastels , the richer the paintings became . " <p> Huse paints her pastels on canvas that she prepares using a solution of finely ground pumice , acrylic gel , and water . " The problem I had with paper is that overworked areas can develop shiny spots where the tooth has been rubbed off , and these areas , for me , ruined the look of the pastel , " she comments . Huse coats the canvas in three directions to ensure complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she can . " The result is a surface that feels just like sandpaper , " she describes . " It has enough tooth to allow me to build up layers of pastel . " Huse tones the canvas with an oil wash of a color because , she says , " I do n't want to feel I have to cover every single centimeter , and the color that shows through adds sparkle to the finished work . " <p> Like many artists , Huse has ideas about Degas ' pastels . " I believe Degas ' power came from treating the pastels the way he would treat an oil painting , " she states . " When I work with pastel I do n't think of drawing or sketching . Rather , I try to think of the pastel as the tip of a paintbrush that I use to apply lines in various directions . " This rationale is evident in her work , so much so that Huse 's pastels are frequently mistaken for oil paintings . <p> Huse starts a painting with the underlying darks , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applying black , she then sprays the painting with fixative because black spreads easily and can muddy the other colors . Next , she layers blue , green , red , or purple , letting some of the black show through . " For example , " she says , " if I go from black to purple , I may apply blue or red over those . I make the strokes in different directions for each color layer , and because it 's pastel and the pigments sit on top of one another , the eye mixes the numerous colors . The fun of pastel is that I can make marks that are unique to the medium , swirls and drawinglike marks . It 's nice to have some of that along with the usual pastel strokes . <p> " Color layering is the key to making vibrant pastels , " the artist continues . " For a flesh tone I might start with a dark brown or blue-brown before building up lighter values on top . This gives more depth and brilliance than going straight for the final color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to put it another way , it helps the pigment to speak more clearly when it has an underlying cast of colors supporting it . " Huse also overlays colors to minimize one she thinks is too bold . She explains , " In a sky where I want to tone down the blue I take orange or peach and lay it on top . The method is similar to scumbling with paint . " <p> The danger of applying many layers of pastel is overworking , which occurs when the tooth of the paper gets clogged with pigment , either from too many layers or from using soft pastels instead of hard ones for the underlayers . " For the beginner , the difference between overlaying numerous coats of pastel and overworking is tricky to judge . The best question to ask is whether it looks muddy , " Huse advises . " If it does , it 's overworked . On some surfaces I have used a paintbrush to brush off pigment from an overworked area , or I gently tap and blow on it to remove some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pastel is based on working from hard to soft . " When layering colors I start with the hardest pastels and , on top of those , go to the softer ones  --  never the other way around , " she declares . " I use the very softest pastels for the buttery finishes . " <p> Huse and Dyer are wary of fixative as a final coat , and they both consider it a sticky situation in more ways than one . They talk of color changes , of darks getting lighter , and of the highlights disappearing . Though both artists spray fixative very lightly as a final coat , they recommend experimenting with several brands . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : After the Bath , by Margaret Dyer , 2000 , pastel , 12 x 9 .
