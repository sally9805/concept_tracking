MAX ELEVATION : 9,000 feet MAX VERTICAL DROP : 1,200 feet AVERAGE VERTICAL LOGGED PER HALF-DAY : 4,000 feet PRICE : $100 for four runs GETTING THERE : Head west out of South Lake Tahoe on Highway 50 , take 89 South for 15 miles , then take 88 West for another 14 . INFO : 209-258-7360 ; kirkwood.com Ask Kirkwood locals why their mountain gets it so good and you 'll get an earful : It 's orographic cloud-lifting , it 's Cousin Marvin 's good karma , it 's sheer-luck geography . But mostly they 'll attribute it to something they call the K Factor . We 're still not sure what that means  --  coherent definitions of the K Factor are hard to come by . But the numbers do n't lie : Kirkwood reported a whopping 804 inches last year , a full 250 more than some Tahoe resorts . And with 9 percent moisture content , its snow is much drier than your average Sierra cement . Which is where Kirkwood Powder Cats ( KPC ) comes in : Their half-day structure  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the base area 's Red Cliffs Day Lodge ) make KPC the ideal way to access Red Cliffs , a 100-acre , northwest-facing aspect of sparsely wooded and above treeline terrain : 1,000 feet of vertical through open faces and glades that funnel into powder-filled chutes . See for yourself , and if you come up with a sound definition of the K Factor , drop us a line . SNOWPACK Storms get colder as they rise in elevation up the Sierra . By the time they reach Kirkwood , the highest resort in the region , they 've dried out a bit , which adds stability as lighter inches fall on top of wetter layers and then consolidate . And because most aspects are northwest- facing , they also stabilize in the sun . Even so , Red Cliffs still has six major avalanche paths , and patrollers control the ridgeline after storms . TERRAIN HIGHLIGHTS The right side is mellow ( 30 to 35 degrees ) . Head farther left and it gets steeper and tighter . The Third Chute features a 40-degree pitch and an exit with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are typically January and February ( but that 's relative  --  you can get 24-inch pileups all winter long ) . The rest of the season , 80 percent of the storms blow in from Alaska , and usually last just 48 hours . March is probably your best bet : Last year , a front deposited 10 feet over six days . THE GUIDES Six KPC employees and six Kirkwood Resort patrollers share the benefits of guiding ; all of them hold Level II avalanche certification . THE LODGE Many of Kirkwood 's condo units are owned by Silicon Valley types who pimp them out with exotic artwork . Basic hotel-style rooms start at $125 ; luxury , 2,300-square-foot three-bedrooms go from $620 a night ( kirkwood.com ) . All have access to a brand-new recreation center  --  complete with outdoor heated pool , fitness center , and 20-person hot tub  --  across from Red Cliffs Lodge . THE CHOW The resort is n't exactly brimming with options . Monte Wolfe 's , in the base village , serves a breakfast croissant sandwich the size of a sixth grader . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic bar fare , or try the Kirkwood Inn for the house specialty , Zak Fries . BANG FOR BUCK Huge . Drop an additional $25 , and you can ski the other half of the day inbounds . So let 's do the math : That 's $125 for a full day of cat/lift skiing . We 've looked around , and this is probably the best powder-to-loot ratio we 've found . Trust us . MUST-KNOW Because the skiable terrain is so small , and it gets pretty tracked out in a day or two , KPC runs the cats only when there 's fresh snow . But finally they 're permitted and set to move the entire operation over to Martin Point , on the northwest side of the mountain , which features bigger vert ( 2,000 feet ) , steeper terrain ( up to 55 degrees ) , and more trees . Plus , it means they 'll be able to operate more often .  --  RYAN BRANDT Illustration PHOTO : COREY RICH They call it the K Factor Todd Rudhall floats above Kirkwood Resort . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
