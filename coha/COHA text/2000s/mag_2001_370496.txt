Federal prosecutors went after BBQ , a New Orleans dance-promotion company , because partyers who attended its legendary Big Easy raves often ended up in the emergency room with drug-related symptoms . The idea was to challenge BBQ under the Crack House Statute , a 1986 federal law making it illegal to maintain a property for the purpose of drug use ; the law had never been used against rave or nightclub promoters . But a bizarre plea deal reached in the case last week will probably satisfy no one . The feds admitted they have no evidence that the company 's managers were distributing drugs . In turn BBQ admits it could have done more to prevent ravers from taking ecstasy before and during its parties . BBQ 's raves will be allowed to go on , but pacifiers and glow sticks will be banned . BBQ will also ban " chill rooms , " where ravers go to cool down from ecstasy 's body-temperature-raising effects . So while the raves will continue , more than likely so will the overdoses . <P>  --  Reported by John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
