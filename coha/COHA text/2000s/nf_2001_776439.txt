NOW IN HIS MID-FORTIES , a university graduate with computer skills , Osama bin Laden lives with his four wives and some fifteen children in a small cave in eastern Afghanistan . They have no running water and only a rudimentary heating system against the extreme cold of winter . Bin Laden is always on guard against assassins , commando raids , and air strikes . Had he followed the path chosen for him by his father , bin Laden could have been a respected building contractor in Saudi Arabia and a billionaire in his own right . Instead he freely elected to abandon the life of affluence and commit himself to waging a jihad under extremely harsh conditions . // Osama bin Laden is not the only Islamist who has abandoned a good career and comfortable lifestyle in order to wage a jihad . Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri - bin Laden 's right-hand man - now in his late forties , could have been one of Egypt 's leading pediatricians but gave up a promising career and affluence to fight the Egyptian government . He then refused political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ended up living in eastern Afghanistan not far from bin Laden . // Although bin Laden and Zawahiri are the most notorious Islamist terrorists , there are hundreds like them . These dedicated commanders in turn lead thousands of terrorists in a relentless and uncompromising holy war against the United States and the West as a whole . The bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 were the latest but by far not the last shots in this rapidly escalating war of terrorism . What makes these individuals - the leaders and symbols of the new Islamist upsurge - commit themselves to this kind of war ? // The rise of the new radical Islamist elite is a recent phenomenon in the developing world . These leaders , from the affluent and privileged segment of society , are highly educated and relatively Westernized . They are not the underprivileged , impoverished , and embittered isolates who usually constitute the pool that breeds terrorists and radicals . These Islamist terrorist leaders are different from the typical European middle-class revolutionaries and terrorists - from the anarchists of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century - because the Islamists have become popular leaders of the underprivileged masses , while the European terrorists remained isolated from a generally hostile population . Only Ernesto " Che " Guevara - the Argentinian doctor turned revolutionary fighter of the early 1960s - came close to being the kind of populist leader these Islamists are . // To understand these Islamist leaders - particularly Osama bin Laden - one needs to understand their break with their past , their motivation , the fire in their veins , and the depth of their hatred of the United States and what it stands for . // OSAMA BIN LADEN , Ayman al-Zawahiri , and their compatriots , mostly Saudis and Egyptians , are the product of the tumultuous 1970s and 1980s . Their entire lives , from their early years up until the time they rejected a luxurious lifestyle and embraced radicalism and militancy , were strongly influenced by key events unfolding in the Middle East - most importantly , the Arab prosperity and identity crisis that accompanied the oil boom in the 1970s , the triumph of revolutionary Islam in Iran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 1980s. // Osama bin Muhammad bin Laden was born in the city of Riyadh , Saudi Arabia , probably in 1957 . At the time his father , Muhammad bin Laden , was a small-time builder and contractor who had arrived from Yemen in search of employment . Osama was one of numerous siblings - his father had more than fifty children from several wives . Muhammad bin Laden was conscientious about education and advancement in life and tried to provide his children with proper schooling . During the 1960s the family moved to the Hijaz , western Saudi Arabia , and ultimately settled in Al-Medina Al-Munawwara . Osama received most of his formal education in the schools of Medina and later Jedda , Saudi Arabia 's main commercial port on the Red Sea . // The oil boom of the 1970s changed Muhammad bin Laden 's fortunes . The development boom in the Hijaz brought him in direct contact with the Saudi elite , and he soon developed a special relationship with the upper-most echelons of the House of al-Saud as both a superior builder and the provider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " causes . " His contacts at the top enabled Muhammad bin Laden to expand his business into one of the biggest construction companies in the entire Middle East - the Bin Laden Corporation . The special status of the bin Laden company was established when the House of al-Saud contracted with it to refurbish and rebuild the two holy mosques in Mecca and Medina . During the 1970s , the bin Laden company was involved in the construction of roads , buildings , mosques , airports , and the entire infrastructure of many of the Arab countries of the Persian Gulf . // Osama was destined to follow in his father 's footsteps . He went to high school in Jedda and then studied management and economics at King Abdul Aziz University in Jedda , one of Saudi Arabia 's best schools . His father promised him he would be put in charge of his own company , which would enjoy the bin Ladens ' direct access to the Court to gain extremely profitable contracts . // Osama bin Laden started the 1970s as did many other sons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Saudi Arabia with sojourns in cosmopolitan Beirut . While in high school and college Osama visited Beirut often , frequenting flashy nightclubs , casinos , and bars . He was a drinker and womanizer , which often got him into bar brawls. // Ultimately , however , Osama bin Laden was not an ordinary Saudi youth having a good time in Beirut . In 1973 Muhammad bin Laden was deeply affected spiritually when he rebuilt and refurbished the two holy mosques , and these changes gradually affected Osama . Even while he was still taking brief trips to Beirut , he began showing interest in Islam . He started reading Islamic literature and soon began his interaction with local Islamists . In 1975 the outbreak of the Lebanese civil war prevented further visits to Beirut . The Saudi Islamists claimed that the agony of the Lebanese was a punishment from God for their sins and destructive influence on young Muslims . Osama bin Laden was strongly influenced by these arguments . // The drastic personal change in Osama bin Laden 's life in the mid-1970s reflects the turmoil of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1970s. // What began as a period of Arab self-respect and great expectations - derived from the self-perceived restoration of " Arab honor " in the 1973 Yom Kippur War ( the coordinated Egyptian-Syrian surprise attack against Israel that ended with an inconclusive Israeli military victory ) and then the great affluence and influence resulting from the oil boom that followed the embargo of 1973-1974 ( which the oil-producing states of the Arabian Peninsula declared in order to force the West into adopting anti-Israeli policies ) - quickly turned into an era of acute crisis and trauma due to the Arab world 's inability to cope with the consequences of its actions . The sudden increase in wealth of the ruling elite and the upper and educated strata and exposure to the West led to confusion and a largely unresolved identity crisis resulting in radicalism and eruptions of violence . Improved media access and availability throughout the region brought home crises in other parts of the world . Be-cause of its conservative Islamic character and sudden wealth and influence , Saudi Arabia was uniquely influenced by these dynamics . // In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often contradictory trends influencing Saudi society at the time . As Saudi Arabia 's main port city on the Red Sea coast , Jedda was exposed to Western influence more than most other Saudi cities were . Sailors and experts came to Jedda , while the increasingly rich local elite , including the bin Laden family , visited the West . Coming from generally conservative and isolated Saudi Arabia , these visitors were shocked by their encounter with the West - by the personal freedoms and affluence of the average citizen , by the promiscuity , and by the alcohol and drug use of Western youth . Many young Saudis could not resist experimenting with the forbidden . When they returned to Saudi Arabia , they brought with them the sense of individualism and personal freedoms they encountered in the West . // The wealth and worldly character of Jedda also transformed it into a shelter for Islamist intellectuals persecuted throughout the Muslim world . Several universities , primarily King Abdul Aziz University in Jedda , which bin Laden attended from 1974 to 1978 , became a hub of vibrant Islamist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the universities and mosques , providing an opportunity to study and share their knowledge . They addressed the growing doubts of the Saudi youth . Their message to the confused was simple and unequivocal - only an absolute and unconditional return to the fold of conservative Islamism could protect the Muslim world from the inherent dangers and sins of the West . // In March 1975 , in the midst of the oil boom and the Islamic intellectual backlash against it , Saudi Arabia 's King Faisal was assassinated . The assassin , Prince Faisal ibn Musaid , was the king 's deranged nephew . He was also thoroughly Westernized and had visited the United States and Western Europe frequently . Both Islamists and Court insiders expressed apprehension that exposure to Western ways had caused Faisal ibn Musaid to go insane . Although the succession process worked and the kingdom suffered no ensuing crisis , the seed of doubt and discontent was sown . The assassination was a turning point for Saudi Arabia . For both the Saudi establishment and the conscientious elite , the assassination of the beloved king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinful and perilous influence of the West had been on target . The shock of the assassination brought home the real and communal ramifications of the Westernization of the country 's educated and affluent youth , creating a grassroots backlash and sending many of these youth , including bin Laden , back into the fold of Islamism. // In the mid-1970s unfolding events in Egypt - the undisputed leader of the Arab world and politics - were also having a major impact on the Saudi educated elite . Jedda was the key entry port for printed material arriving from Egypt , and many of the Islamist intellectuals operating in the city 's universities and mosques were Egyptian . They maintained close contacts with their colleagues still in Egypt and advocated their views , exposing the students of Jedda 's universities , including bin Laden , to their works and opinions . Already attuned to and tilting toward Islamism , bin Laden was influenced by these Egyptian studies and the events that prompted them . In the mid-1970s Egyptian president Anwar Sadat courted the Americans to gain political and economic assistance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the process of courting the United States , Sadat 's image changed from that of a traditional village leader to that of a thoroughly Westernized world leader . The personality cult that Sadat developed domestically only alienated the educated elite , whose knowledge of and firsthand experience with the West caused them to fear its adverse impact on the traditional values of Muslim society . // The Islamist fundamentalist movement in Egypt was rejuvenated in the mid-1970s by young activists with Western - mainly secular and technical - educations who gave up their attempt to define their communal place in a world dominated by the West and its values . Intellectually active and curious , they produced high-quality literature that was widely circulated among the young Arab elite . In 1975 Egyptian writer and engineer Wail Uthman , one of the early influential ideologues of the most militant branch of the Islamist movement , published The Party of God in Struggle with the Party of Satan . This book divided the world into two social entities - the Party of God and the Party of Satan - and urged believers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the preface to the second edition of his book , Uthman emphasized that in writing about the unbelievers , the members of the Party of Satan , he was actually referring to Sadat 's regime . " Many thought I meant the Communist party when I wrote the Devil 's party , " he admitted . But although according to Uthman the Communists are an " essential support " of the Party of Satan , to him they are not the source of evil . " The Party of Satan is that group of people who pretend to believe in Islam but in reality are Islam 's first enemies , " Uthman wrote . He considered exposure to Western everyday life the source of the mounting crisis of Islam and saw no solution but Islamic militancy . // The Arab world was jolted in 1977 when Sadat visited Jerusalem and began the process that would lead to signing a peace agreement with Israel . Sadat 's recognition of Israel was the first overt breaking of the " taboo " the Jewish state constitutes - the widest common denominator in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secret Channels , Egyptian journalist and commentator Mohamed Heikal stressed that the Arab world is motivated by " a blend of fury and revulsion " toward Israel that the present " peace process " has yet to breach . The combination of a dread of Westernization and the breaking of the " taboo " pushed many Arabs to extremes . The grassroots rejection of the president-turned-pharaoh mobilized scores of youth throughout all of Egyptian society - from the affluent and educated to the poor villagers and slum dwellers , from members of the security services to outcasts in the desert - to seek Islamist solutions to the profound crises afflicting Egypt . // Soon Islamist youth in Egypt and elsewhere had forceful proof of the righteousness of their cause . On February 1 , 1979 , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini returned to Iran , overthrew the shah , and established the Islamic Republic . Throughout the Muslim world the masses celebrated the success of Khomeini 's Islamic Revolution as the triumph of Islam over the United States and the West . The Islamic Revolution became a source of pride and envy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rulers could be over-thrown by Islamist forces . The impact of Iran was strong in Egypt because Sadat invited the deposed shah to take shelter there , a flagrant affront to the sentiments of most of the population . // The radical Shiite movement was the force behind the Iranian Revolution , and its development in Iran , Lebanon , and Iraq was almost simultaneous to and paralleled the evolution of Sunni revivalism in Egypt . //
