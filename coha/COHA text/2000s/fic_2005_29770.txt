Monday , 23 December 1991 Television newsreaders , metro workers , shop assistants and babushka in the market all said the same thing : " the Soviet Union is no more . " Eleven of the fifteen constituent republics had met in Alma-Ata over the weekend and agreed to dissolve the union , nine days short of its seventieth birthday . " The Soviet Union is no more " , indeed , but no two people said it exactly the same ; the phrase came loaded with hope , fear , relief , apprehension , joy , anger , excitement and nostalgia , and each person 's mixture was different . * * * " No matter how much we hated the old system " Lev never used the words Soviet Union ' " it provided a kind of order . It was predictable . But now the authority is gone , the police are weak and afraid to deal with the black-asses from the south especially the Chechens . They 've been allowed to establish a presence here in Moscow , and it looks like it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their blood feuds and their tribal armies . We have n't survived communism just to let a bunch of niggers fuck us in the ass . " There were three men at the table , Lev , Testarossa and Banzai , all of them vory thieves-in-law who had abandoned their given names in favour of noms de guerre and relinquished their right to a home or family in favour of the brotherhood of criminals . Between them , they ran Moscow 's three largest Slav gangs . Lev was in charge of the 21st Century Association , Testarossa the Solntsevskaya and Banzai the Podolskaya . They had come to this dacha north-west of Moscow for a summit meeting . Each man had an ashtray in front of him . There was vodka on the table and smoked fish onthe side-board . Outside , the snow was falling again , whirling against a wan sky . Cigarette ends glowed like fireflies through the windows ; three gang leaders meant scores of bodyguards . Lev ran his hands over his head . In accordance with tradition , as the man with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been officially designated an enemy of the state ) , Lev had seniority over the other two . " As it stands , " Lev continued , his voice croaking , " we 're not organising ourselves in the most productive manner . We compete with each other for control , be it of Moscow districts or business sectors . Testarossa , you want some of my pie in Kitai-gorod ; Banzai , I want your counterfeit vodka interests . In normal times , this is perfectly healthy ; honourable vory come to a mutually acceptable arrangement , and if they ca n't do so , then the strongest man wins . But these are n't normal times , my brothers . If we keep fighting among ourselves , the Chechens will take over . They 're the enemy now . So I propose a truce ; we suspend operations against each other and join forces against the Chechens . " " Until when ? " Banzai said . " Until we 've beaten them . " " And then ? " " And then we take their interests and divide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features the narrow eyes and plate-broad cheekbones of Sakhalin , just across the water from Japan arranged themselves into something the far side of scepticism . Lev turned to Testarossa . " What do you think , brother ? This ca n't go ahead without your agreement ; it 's your men and your firepower we 'll be calling on the most . " The Solntsevskaya was the largest single gang in Russia , let alone Moscow . Testarossa could call on four thousand men and at least five hundred Kalashnikovs , one thousand machine pistols , fifty Uzi rifles and a handful of Mukha grenade launchers . The 21st Century Association had no more than half this capacity ; Banzai 's Podolskaya only half that again . " Do you even need to ask , brother ? " When Testarossa smiled , his eyes were liquid smoke beneath a blaze of red hair . His hairline sat low on his brow , virtually nudging his eyebrows . In the prison camp at Magadan , he 'd tattooed his forehead : Fucked by the Party . The authorities had pulled down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support another vor in any circumstance ; is n't that our first rule ? What have we become , if we do n't define ourselves against the enemy ? We 'll band together against the narrow-films , and be proud of it . " " Spoken like a true vor . I thank you . " Lev looked at Banzai . " And you , little brother ? You need this alliance more than either of us . " " Little brother . That 's it , is n't it ? I lend you my men and my weapons , and when it 's over you two divide the spoils between you and I get fucked . " " When it 's over . " Lev 's voice was suddenly hard " we 'll negotiate freely and fairly . We 're men of honour . I wo n't let petty money-grabbing undermine the criminal brotherhood which we 're all sworn to defend . Remember , vory must always tell the truth to fellow members . " It took Banzai a moment to recognise the implicit threat behind Lev 's words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What truth ? " " There 's nothing you have n't told us , little brother ? " " No , nothing . " " A trip to Kazan , perhaps ? " Banzai 's head went back and up a fraction ; back in surprise , up in defiance . The Tatar capital of Kazan was the processing centre for 3MF , trimethyl phentanyl , a dry white powder several times more potent than heroin and impossible to detect when mixed with water . " The thieves ' code specifically bans traffic in drugs , " Lev said . " Whatever else we fight them for , the Chechens can have the narcotics , all of them . They 're animals anyway , so let them lose their souls . " " The drug trade 's worth millions of dollars , Lev . Better we control it than them . " " Banzai , have you forgotten what it means to be a vor ? It 's not just money . " " Do n't talk to me of what a vor should or should not do , Lev @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not co-operate with the authorities , right ? But you 're a parliamentary deputy . A vor must never accept a job at a state-owned institution , right ? But you run the country 's largest distillery . A vor must not fraternise with communist organisations , yet you have a KGB man , Tengiz Sabirzhan , as your trusted deputy . " Lev pushed his chair back and stood . Upright , his dimensions came into sharper focus . He rarely used his size deliberately to intimidate ; he knew that it usually did so without his having to try . He placed his hands on the table ; then , suddenly , reached out and slapped Banzai across the face , the traditional punishment for a vor who 'd insulted another vor . When Lev spoke , his voice was Vesuvian . " The Russian parliament , whose resistance helped destroy the Soviet Union . The distillery whose appropriation was approved by the vory at the Murmansk summit back in ' 87 , because it benefited us and hurt the KGB , all at once . As for Sabirzhan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it suits my purpose , nothing more . " He subsided back into his chair . " Everything 's up for grabs cars , weapons , haulage , prostitution , gambling , banking , vodka . Everything . Smuggling income 's going to go through the roof ; each successor republic will now exercise jurisdiction only within its own borders , so goods stolen in Russia can be legally traded anywhere outside . The central finance system 's gone to shit , so there 's millions to be had from currency speculation . We 've a freedom of movement unthinkable even a year ago . The country 's changing day by day . It 's the revolution all over again . If we 're to take our rightful place in the new Russia , now is the time to strike . But in order to seize this opportunity we too must change . " Lev fingered the home-made aluminium cross that dangled from his neck . The cross , like his habit of wearing his shirt outside his trousers with a waistcoat on top , was a deliberate homage to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Stalin 's reign . " No . " When Banzai shook his head , his plaited dreadlocks jerked like a Turkish bead curtain . " You talk about the Chechens as though they 're an organised army . They 're nothing of the sort . They 're ignorant , undisciplined psychopaths who 'd as soon murder their own brothers as any of us . Their idea of refinement is to take their meat rare rather than raw . Thank you , but no . I prefer to take my chances alone . " " But you 're outnumbered , little brother , and we ca n't have you outside the tent pissing in . By a margin of two to one , the decision is taken : we unite . " Lev wagged his finger to emphasise the point . It was tattooed with a symbol : In life , only count on yourself . " Over my dead body , " said Banzai. * * * On the other side of Moscow , at the foot of the old hilltop royal estate of Kolomenskoe , three Chechen ganglords Karkadann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Avtomobilnaya were meeting in similar circumstances . They were not vory ; Chechens never were . Instead , they styled themselves avtoritety , authorities ' , and they saw themselves as harder and more pragmatic than their adversaries . The Tsentralnaya gang was the most powerful of the three , and so it was to Karkadann 's house that Zhorzh and Ilmar had come ; Zhorzh from his base at the Ostankino Hotel in the northern suburbs , and Ilmar from inspecting some of the South Port car showrooms for which his Avtomobilnaya group provided protection . " Be free ! " they said as they greeted each other . Karkadann 's face was rawhide , a tangle of crevasses and creases : cheekbones like raised daggers , shadowed holes for eyes , a bent nail of a nose . Here was a man who walked down the darkest avenues , wielding his face like a club . He took his visitors outside , despite the weather and his limp ; his garden was vast , and he wanted to show it off . They talked while shuffling down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Lev tomorrow , " Karkadann said . " He 's seeing his vory now . I speak for us , he speaks for them ; that 's what we 've arranged . He may offer us a deal , he may not . If he does n't , it 's war , plain and simple . If he does . . . " He grinned , as sharp and menacing as a sword unsheathed ; " if he does , it 's still war , even plainer and simpler . " " You do n't know what he 'll offer , " Ilmar said . Karkadann reached down into a bucket , pulled out a raw steak , and tossed it at the caged bear he kept to intimidate his debtors . " Whatever it is , it wo n't be enough . " " It wo n't be everything , you mean . " " Take it how you like . " Karkadann jabbed at the air with a gloved hand . " Even if we did make an agreement , do you think those bastards would honour it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 've hated us for centuries . They hate us , the police hate us , every useless drone in this city hates us . As far as they 're concerned , the only good Chechen is a dead Chechen . The only reason they tolerate us is because they 're scared of us . And if we make a deal with the Slavs , we 've lost even that . So there it is . All or nothing , a fight to the death . If you have any doubts , speak now . " He hobbled towards the walled garden . His right leg was ten centimetres shorter than his left , but no one was certain how this had happened ; some said a mafiya attack , some a childhood deformation , some the revenge of a jealous husband . It was typical of Karkadann that no one knew for sure ; equally typical that he chose not to enlighten anyone who asked . Zhorzh shook his head . The white streak in his hair made him look like a cross between Trotsky and the devil in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm guessing five , six thousand men , " Ilmar said . " We 've half that at most . " " Ha ! Then they should be quaking , " Karkadann shouted . " One Chechen is worth ten Russians ! Have you gone soft , Ilmar ? What 's happened to your mountain pride ? What is agreement , if not surrender ? And when did you last see a Chechen surrender , eh ? " Ilmar had softer features and lighter skin than his fellow avtoritety . He rubbed at his chin and said nothing . The singing fountain , which in the summer emitted different notes depending on the height of the water , stood in winter stasis . As they walked , Karkadann checked that there were no gaps in the wire or the netting around the perimeter fence . His guards made the rounds every day , but there was nothing like checking for oneself . " All right , " Ilmar said eventually , but his unhappiness was plain to see . * * * " You 're not serious , " Lev @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated , and it was clear that serious was exactly what he was being . He 'd made his name in the camps for attacking guards ; the other vory had taken bets on when , not if , the authorities would give Banzai the bullet . Now , Lev 's slap had marked not just Banzai 's face but also his reputation . " I want no part of this . I want simply to be treated as a vor . " Banzai was agitated , speaking fast . " But you refuse to listen to me you slap me . " He shrugged extravagantly . " What choice do I have ? I 'm walking out of here , and the only way to stop me is to kill me . " " Banzai , you 're being ridiculous , " Testarossa said . " Kill me , " Banzai repeated . " And Testarossa , it 's you that 'll have to do it . " Lev could have snapped Banzai 's neck like a breadstick , but vory tradition dictates that the senior man present ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice was almost jaunty . " Do you dare , Testarossa ? Do you dare kill a fellow vor , for nothing more than disagreeing with you ? Hah ! The system 's been dead two days , and already you 're acting like the KGB . " He pushed his chair back and it fell with a crash . The bodyguards were outside , facing away from the windows . What went on within the dacha was not their business . " This is getting out of hand , " Lev said , realising too late that he had miscalculated badly in expecting Banzai to understand that his proposals were motivated not by self-interest but the good of the vory . The thieves ' code had much to commend it indeed , they would never have survived the Soviet system without it but a creed that dated back to the days of bandits and highwaymen was inadequate to the demands of these changing times . The very inflexibility that had been its greatest strength would doom the vory to destruction if Lev failed in his bid to drag the brotherhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignore the ban on drug-trafficking , but any alliance with the state even when the vory had the upper hand in the partnership was anathema to him . Now he was prepared to challenge Lev and risk death over a mere slap , because the code demanded it . And if Lev 's progressive leadership were to survive the challenge , he must deal with Banzai according to the code . " You leave , Banzai , and you 're compromising the very future of the brotherhood , " Lev said . Banzai started for the exit as if he had n't heard . He walked at normal pace , allowing Testarossa to reach the door and cut him off two paces short . Testarossa was ten centimetres taller and ten kilos heavier than Banzai ; it would hardly be a fair fight . " You really want me to do this ? " Testarossa asked , pushing himself back against the door . " Do you dare ? " Lev was sitting at the head of the table . Testarossa looked to him for guidance , as if seeking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your knife with you ? " Lev asked . Testarossa tapped at his right hip . " Always . " Lev 's head rose and fell : a simple movement , a death sentence . Testarossa placed his hands on Banzai 's shoulders and began to spin him round , slowly at first , as Banzai resisted , and then with increasing ease . A full circle took away the victim 's soul and supposedly made it easier for him to accept death ; it was the point of no return in the vory death ceremony . When he next faced Testarossa , Banzai 's eyes were wide , as though he 'd been playing a game and only now saw that his brinkmanship had backfired . Testarossa manoeuvred Banzai against the wall ; he was firm , but took care not to be rough . Lev watched from the table , five paces away and as remote as Vladivostok . " Die like a vor , " Testarossa said , only marginally more statement than question . Banzai gripped his own collar with sweat-slimed palms , knuckles drained white , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was watching Lev ; had they been , they 'd have seen his face twitch in a momentary wince . " Take my soul , " Banzai said , and Testarossa drew the knife from his belt and plunged it into Banzai 's throat , right up to the hilt , the way they 'd used to kill people in the gulag . * * * Ilmar stood by his limousine and indicated his watch . " I 'll miss prayer if I do n't hurry , " he said . " Good for you , " replied Karkadann . " I do n't know how you manage it . I can never fit in my three times a day . " They hugged sideways , Chechen-style . " It 's five times a day , actually . " " Oh well . . . " Karkadann 's voice was bright . " The more the merrier. " * * * The television schedules had been cleared for Gorbachev to announce his resignation with the union gone , there was nothing for him to be president of any more but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were greeted by an empty chair . " It 's all come as a bit of a shock to him , " one of the presidential staff explained . " He needs time to get used to it , that 's all . " They showed the empty chair on TV until it was time for the next programme .
