Iman 's Cause is not Just Close to her Heart  --  it 's Close to home . Long before Iman became an international supermodel , she was a diplomat 's child who had been blessed by unusually benevolent fates . " I was taken to school in a chauffeur-driven car , and I had this very privileged life , " she says . Then came her glamorous run as a fashion icon , followed by her A-list marriage to rock star David Bowie and a new career in business with her own company , Iman Cosmetics , Skincare and Fragrances . Rich , gorgeous and successful , she has enjoyed good fortune to a degree that would be extraordinary for anyone  --  let alone a girl born in one of Africa 's poorest countries .

Earrings by Simon Alcantara And yet there was a moment when Iman 's life could have taken a tragic turn and ended up very differently . Her father served as the Somalian ambassador to a series of Middle Eastern countries , and his well-traveled children lived in Egypt , Saudi Arabia and Sudan in addition to their native land . But after the family returned to Somalia following a coup d ' ' tat there in 1969 , Iman 's parents soon feared for their safety . " People from the old regime started to disappear , " Iman recalls . " My mother was very worried and decided we were going to flee the country . In 1970 she woke us up in the middle of the night and told us we were leaving but to take nothing . We crossed the border into Kenya with nothing but the clothes on our backs . And overnight our lives changed . " If they had n't taken such precautions , Iman 's parents might also have been forcibly " disappeared . " Iman and her four siblings could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As it was , the hardships they endured as refugees taught her some enduring lessons . " It broke my heart to see my father feeling that he could n't take care of us , " she says . " I learned about character then , because of living as a have  --  and then as a have-not . " Such tribulations are far behind her , but Iman is not one to forget where she came from . As soon as her modeling career took off , in 1976 , she was inspired to get involved with the Children 's Defense Fund after hearing a speech by its charismatic founder , Marian Wright Edelman . Iman also supported such other groups as Doctors Without Borders and Action Against Hunger . Photograph : Iman in the early 1960s , an ambassador 's privileged daughter . These days her top priority is Keep a Child Alive ( KCA ) , a relatively new organization dedicated to providing medication and treatment for African families afflicted with AIDS . For years Iman had anguished over an appropriate response to the pandemic that was ravaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frustrated by the red tape and corrupt administrations that were doing a poor job of funneling aid to those in need . " Africa is in the mess it 's in mostly because of our governments , which have let us down repeatedly , " Iman says . " I have always believed in what Mother Teresa said : " Do n't wait for governments to do things ; it has to be people-to-people . ' ' " But finding the right way to help proved difficult . " I want accountability , " Iman says . " I ca n't ask any human being to give anything if I ca n't account for where it 's going to go , so it 's been a struggle for me to find where I fit in this without just washing my hands of it . Then you think , " If not I  --  the African  --  then who ? ' ' " When Keep a Child Alive sought her out , Iman decided she had finally found the appropriate outlet : a small , results-oriented group that aims to spend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on bureaucracy . KCA was cofounded in 2003 by singer Alicia Keys and Leigh Blake , a British AIDS activist who had previously cofounded Artists Against AIDS Worldwide and the Red Hot Organization , a charity that works through the music industry to raise funds for AIDS care and research . Blake describes KCA as " the punk-rock version of a charity  --  a rebel organization that acts in a grassroots way to provide drugs , food , counseling and medical treatment to African children and families who have AIDS . " Last year KCA gave $1.3 million in grants to more than a dozen clinics , focusing most of its efforts on Rwanda , South Africa , Kenya and Uganda , although it also provided funds in Ethiopia , Mali and Zimbabwe . So far , KCA has helped more than 3,000 adults and children with AIDS to obtain lifesaving antiretroviral medication and has provided additional medical care , training and psychological support to another 20,000 people with HIV .

To Blake , Iman was the perfect choice as a global ambassador for the cause . " All the charities talking for Africa generally talk through white folks , " she says . " We really wanted a woman raised in Africa who understood what it meant to be African but who was famous enough to speak to a global audience , since the second part of our agenda is public education . " Their task could n't be more daunting . " Twenty-five million sub-Saharan Africans have died of AIDS , twenty-four million are infected , there are thirteen million orphans , and more than two million people die every year , " Blake reports . To Iman , the moral imperative is clear . " AIDS is manageable , " she says . " In the West you can stay healthy by taking medication , but in Africa the medication you need to take on a daily basis for the rest of your life is not available or affordable . How can you say , " I can not give it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What kind of a society have we become when the least among us , the children , are left to this ? It 's always about the price ; at the end of the day , money is what 's needed . This is a moral issue , and that 's why I got involved . " Iman also believes that Americans should recognize their own vulnerability to such global catastrophes . " This is a problem that 's not going to stay in one place , so it 's in the best interest of the international community to be involved , " she explains . " What flares on that continent will not stay on that continent ; it will spread out and come to find us , like terrorism . " Last year KCA created a public-awareness campaign that was spearheaded by Iman , who persuaded eighteen celebrities to pose for ads featuring the slogan " I am African . " A lovely photograph of the cool , blonde Gwyneth Paltrow was immediately ridiculed by a snarky press , which sneered at her . " Right , Gwynnie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martian . You are the whitest white girl in the entire white world , Paltrow ! " Photograph : For Keep a Child Alive 's public-awareness campaign last year , Iman , husband David Bowie and other celebrities posed for ads proclaiming " I Am African "  --  emphasizing Iman 's belief that , as she says , " we are all connected . " The ads also featured Sarah Jessica Parker , Heidi Klum , Lucy Liu , Gisele Bndchen and Richard Gere , among others , but " the only person who was picked on was Gwyneth , " Iman says . " I was very insulted and furious with the whole thing . I wanted to humanize this pandemic ; my concern was how to put a human face on it , so the dying do n't become just another statistic . The campaign was about the fact that we are all Africans in our DNA . " The controversy nonetheless helped to advance the cause . " I thought it was absolutely ridiculous , but it was great for us ; we were getting 1.5 million hits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of KCA 's major goals is to ameliorate the sense of hopelessness that keeps many people from addressing the AIDS epidemic . " The problem is so big it 's like a bottomless pit , " Iman acknowledges . " It 's heartbreaking to be involved . But this is not about a cure . I want people to be able to say , " It 's not curable , but it 's treatable ; it 's livable . ' It 's not a death sentence anymore . As long as you take your medication , you can live a healthy , long life . Look at Magic Johnson ! All I want is for Africans to get the opportunity . " Although lifesaving anti-retroviral drugs can cost less than a dollar a day , most Africans can not afford them . KCA has set up a donation program through which people can give $30 a month to supply such therapy and related medical care . An annual commitment of $365 " can save a life , " Iman says . Her own emotional connection with these efforts is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like , there but for the grace of God  --  there I go , " she says fervently . " There is nothing special about me . It was just pure luck . We 're talking about modeling , for God 's sake ! It 's not like I earned it . " Iman may not have earned her flawless bone structure , but she 's certainly responsible for her hard work and smart choices . The result is the enviable life she now leads in New York City , where she lives in SoHo with Bowie and their six-year-old daughter , Alexandria . Iman 's older daughter , twenty-eight-year-old Zulekha , works as head of marketing for Iman Cosmetics , Skincare and Fragrances , which creates makeup for women of color . Budding mogul though she may be , Iman looks even less like a tycoon than she does like the mother of a daughter Zulekha 's age . Sitting in a conference room at her office on Manhattan 's fashion-centered Seventh Avenue , she is dressed simply , in a black sweater and pants , wearing no jewelry whatsoever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that of a teenager ; nothing sags or puckers . With her long , dark hair and lithe body , she could be a radiantly unadorned twenty-year-old just starting to model . How is it possible that she looks as youthful in her early fifties as she did three decades ago ? When she flashes a self-deprecating smile , her teeth are perfect and dazzlingly white . " Good genes , " she says with an airy wave of her long , slender hand . " My father is seventy-nine and looks forty . " Those genes catapulted Iman from the life of an impoverished student to a high-flying career as one of the world 's most successful models . In true Cinderella fashion she was even " discovered " by a handsome prince  --  but if the standard fairy tale is cloyingly sweet , this version is as astringent as a dry martini . After two years on scholarship at the University of Nairobi , Iman Abdulmajid was waitressing , working as a translator and wondering how to finance the rest of her college education when she was approached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rakish scion of an aristocratic WASP family and a longtime property owner in Kenya . " One day , on my way to school , this man stopped me and told me how beautiful I was , " she reports . " I thought he was trying to pick me up . He said , " Have you ever been photographed ? '  --  as if , because I was African , I would never have seen a camera . " Iman rolls her eyes at his unwitting condescension . " But then he said the key words : " I 'll pay you ! " I said , " How much ? " He said , " How much do you want ? " I said , " I need a year 's tuition  --  $8,000 . ' He said , " Okay . ' ' " After Beard took his pictures , Iman thought that would be the end of it  --  until she received a phone call from Wilhelmina Cooper , the founder of the Wilhelmina modeling agency , who had seen the photographs and asked her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Why not ? ' ' " Iman recalls with an impish grin . " At this point I was not even eighteen years old , but I thought I could go to the U.S. and come back before my parents found out , so I forged some papers and went . And then I became an overnight sensation ; my parents found out I was here when my father saw my picture in Newsweek . " She sighs . " He never forgave me for that . " For her exasperated parents this was hardly Cinderella 's only transgression . " I married my first love when I was seventeen , " Iman says sheepishly . " He was a hotel manager in Nairobi ; my parents were furious with me . Three months into the marriage I was like , " What the hell have I done ? " By the time I met Peter , I was already separated . The marriage was annulled when I came here . " As for the overnight-sensation part , Iman 's fame received a considerable boost from the irrepressible Beard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new find . " There was a page-one story in the New York Post , " Iman recalls . " Peter told the writer that I was discovered in a jungle , that I was a goatherd who did n't speak a word of English . " Another good-humored sigh . " I spoke more languages than he did , " she adds dryly . Already fluent in English , French , Italian and Arabic , among other languages , Iman was also savvy enough to ride Beard 's fabulous fable to instant notoriety . " He did n't take advantage of me ; I was an accomplice , " she admits with a mischievous twinkle in her velvety brown eyes . Although a stellar career ensued , Iman retained a sensible perspective on both fame and fortune . " We like to believe that modeling is hard , but it 's not that hard , " she observes . " It 's monotonously boring . The amount of money you 're paid for what you do is ridiculous . You grow up and get tired of it . " Photograph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , built in part by KCA . The need for such homes is huge , given the &shy; estimated thirteen million AIDS orphans in Africa and high HIV rates . In South Africa 20 percent of the population is &shy; infected , says KCA . Her decision to stop modeling in 1989 was equally realistic . " It was time for me to quit , before I embarrassed myself looking for jobs . It 's a business about newness , and I was not new anymore , " she says cheerfully . " I knew when to leave the party . I 'm very clearheaded when it comes to things like that . Some people are scared of change , but I 'm always for change . You never know what 's around the corner for you . It was time for me to think about my second act in life . " By then Iman 's ten-year marriage to NBA star Spencer Haywood had also ended . She moved to Los Angeles with their daughter , Zulekha . " I hated L.A. , " she says . " My daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was mind-numbing . " Iman 's life perked up when a hairdresser friend introduced her to Bowie . " He says it was love at first sight , " she relates . " We talked all night . I was very surprised  --  he was funny , engaging and smart , and we had so much in common . " The next day , Iman met Bowie for tea and then left for Paris , where she had one last modeling obligation to fulfill . " I got there and my hotel room was filled with roses  --  pale , because I hate red roses , " she recalls . " When I got back , he picked me up at the airport , without a bodyguard , and I said , " He 's a keeper . ' ' " They married in 1992 , and since then , " it 's like a cabaret every day , " Iman says . " He 's hysterical  --  he finds humor in everything . And he 's very smart ; he 's curious about everything . " Not that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical : Iman 's cosmetics line was originally launched in 1994 in JCPenney stores , but her company suffered problems as it developed , and Penney itself ultimately discontinued its beauty business . Finally , two years ago , Iman signed a licensing agreement with Procter &; Gamble , and both partners believe that the multicultural market represents an enormous opportunity for growth . " By 2022 , non-Caucasians are expected to account for 50 percent of the overall U.S. population , " WWD Beauty Biz reported recently . Other challenges were intensely personal . Iman spent years trying to conceive her second child . " I had one miscarriage after another , " she says . " Then we started doing in vitro , and that was hard ; I was a wreck . The doctor finally said , " It 's not going to happen . Let it go . ' And then  --  it happened . She came ! " Iman was in her mid-forties when Alexandria was born . Although she found it difficult to be a single parent when she was raising Zulekha , her experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mature mother in a stable partnership . " You have much more patience , " she says . " You choose your battles ; you do n't sweat the little stuff . Your priorities are set . " And Iman 's priorities are clear . " Family comes first , " she says firmly . But she never forgets her commitment to the rest of the human family , either . And as archaeological finds and genetic research amass ever more evidence that Africa is the birthplace of humankind , Iman 's views on an individual 's responsibility to the global community seem apt indeed . " We are all connected , " she says . <p>
