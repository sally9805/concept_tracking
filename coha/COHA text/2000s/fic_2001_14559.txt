( In the dark we hear the sounds of the countryside , birds mostly , but the sounds are off or slightly disembodied . Among these sounds the faint sound of a shovel , digging in the earth . This sound increases until it overwhelms the other sounds . As first light appears , a figure is seen digging , or more likely covering a hole in the ground . Then we realize it is Leafeater . The burying is careful and unhurried , but the figure is wearied . Leafeaterleans down to pick up something and put it in his pocket . And yet the sound of the shovel continues for some moments . He slowly walks away from the mound , dragging the shovel behind , the blade of which makes an eerie sound as it drags . But then Leafeater stops , pauses , then turns and walks back to the mound and stands over it ) LEAFEATER Leave . ( A moment of silence ) Me alone .

Lancelot has asthma , but only coughs where noted ) LANCELOT CAPABILITY BROWN Ah , Ah . Watch your finger there , you 're smudging the Pinus radiata . Plant them along the north side . Excellent wind breakers . Along this ridge , the American pines . The saplings should arrive by the end of the week . As you know , Lord Heywood will be travelling . I 've encouraged him to stay away during the early stages . He 's attached to the old gardens , poor man . Says they 're two hundred years old . Now , the old hedges , there and here , almost three miles of them , and across here , out . Three formal gardens , put them under . Both large and small fountains , twelve in all , gone . And the river , here , we will bend her so that at certain vantage points she will look like a substantial lake . Now , I want the lawn brought right up to the steps of the house this time .

This is a commission of some importance and can not be undone by loose britches . ASQUITH BROWN No . Of course . Of course not . That happened only once , I never  --  LANCELOT CAPABILITY BROWN ( Interrupts ) A whore is like a foreign garden on English soil : perfumed , seductive , but ultimately nothing but a painted ruin . All style and no substance . Get a wife  --  it concentrates the mind .

No . Kindness is to be reserved for your wife  --  when you get one , that is . ASQUITH BROWN How are Bridget and the children ? LANCELOT CAPABILITY BROWN In good health , I thank God . They keep their spirits up despite my travelling . ASQUITH BROWN You 'll be in Burghly the next two months then ? LANCELOT CAPABILITY BROWN Yes . Seven miles of grounds there . It 's a delicious bastard , that job . The waters I 've combined make a lake of twenty-seven acres ( Lancelot puts his arm around Asquith 's shoulders and turns him towards the vision he imagines ) p. 5 LANCELOT CAPABILITY BROWN And today , my brother , if you stand at the front of the Earl of Exeter 's house , it looks as though the lake were now a river rolling to meet you .

Bah . Those formal gardens . As rigid as corpses they are , and as sweet in the sun . They 're not for the living . ASQUITH BROWN ( Continuing ) That 's right ! Away with the fiddlesome French , the fastidious Italian designs . And all across the bright green oceanic lawns  --  LANCELOT CAPABILITY BROWN ( uncertain ) Oceanic lawns ( Lancelot breaks the moment with a hard , short coughing fit and goes to roll up the plans .

ASQUITH BROWN We 'll build them a new village . I 'll take care of the design . They 're just uncertain . It 's the change they fear . LANCELOT CAPABILITY BROWN Of course . And Lord Heywood has always dealt fairly with his people . Not even poachers were hung in the Black years . The villagers trust him . Do n't damage that trust . ( Silence some moments ) ASQUITH BROWN You were lucky with Bridget . As you rose , you took her with you . The Ladies of the class we move in still flinch when I take their hand , afraid that the dirt of my childhood is still on my sleeves . Women below me , I can not trust their intentions . Sometimes I believe I will always be alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Still having those nightmares that you are trapped inside a lighthouse ? And yourself , the one sole light calling out unanswered ?

LANCELOT CAPABILITY BROWN Hmm . My suggestion is make sure that your sleeves are always clean in the company of ladies . To act a born gentleman is more difficult that being one . So act well . ( Returning to the plans ) Any other problems you foresee ? ASQUITH BROWN Not at this time- LANCELOT CAPABILITY BROWN ( Hardly listening ) Asquith . You are not merely my representative here . Unlike the other projects , this one I give completely into your hands .

It is a bright day , early morning , in Yorkshire , 1763 . The sounds of nature are heard clearly . It is early spring but still cold .

He splits it and hands each of his friends a piece ) p. 11 CASTLE Up at night with the hunger . I 'm near to quit already . SLIP How far is near to ?

( To Hesp ) We must create , shall we say , spaces of grace spaces without fancy . Something new out of the old . For instance , at a distance , this moment might look , to the ignorant or melodramatic mind , like an well worn story : a gentleman out to seduce a common maid . But take a closer look and one might see new , bold movement in that tired design , such as one finds in the paintings of Claude Lorrain .

CASTLE Truth be told , it 's all in the Niagitherian Thrust : that 's a book word for the kiss . Listen , you slobber in her mouth and she 'll quit you . You hard-bite her tongue and she 'll kick you . The tongue . It 's a little . Shovel . You open her lips and you dig a little , then a little more ' til she 's wide open , then you go in deep for that little worm at the back of her throat that makes her sing . ASQUITH BROWN Well .

It 's a key and you put it in her mouth and turn it like a piece of silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know when you 've opened the lock by the click of her teeth against your own .

They begin to try and straighten the damage to the machine . Asquith directs them ) ASQUITH BROWN Crushed . It 's been crushed . Straighten these bars . And those . Who was in charge of moving the tree ? You 'll have to wire that piece . This machine is for the small trees . Small as in your height and your height .

They could n't get the roots loose and they were jumping up and down  --  ( Asquith climbs onto the frame of the tree mover and begins to pull some small branches loose that are caught in the gears .

I 've had to show them which end of the shovel you stick in the ground . But never mind , never mind . All is well . ( Only now do we become aware of Simone elsewhere on stage . Asquith notices her as well . Simone paints , absorbed in her work ) p. 89 ASQUITH BROWN Pardon me . You must be Simone Faulks . Asquith Brown , at your service . Lord Heywood mentioned that you- SIMONE FAULKS ( Interrupts ) I have met your brother . He is at Compton Verney , is he not ? ASQUITH BROWN Why , yes . And here , and at Syon House and Alnwick and Radly in Oxfordshire , all at once . SIMONE FAULKS Capability Brown is much sought after . ASQUITH BROWN We 're of the same mind , he and I. SIMONE FAULKS But not of the same fame . ASQUITH BROWN Fame is a whimsy . Talent 's in the eye  --  SIMONE FAULKS ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few months ago I was painting green and trees , in a matter of weeks , it 's gone to mud . ( He picks up some soil and sniffs deeply . Simone winces ) ASQUITH BROWN Ah . English soil . Wonderful stuff . Anything can grow in it . We 've brought in three species of pine from the colonies and already they 're flourishing on other estates . And my favourite , the Northern Pitch Pine . It 's a conical conifer . And the cones , a deep red-brown no painter can match but in dreams . The tree is my true mentor , after my dear brother , of course . Because a tree has no desire . Water and light it requires , little more . It does not whine or fret or sulk even when you rip it from the ground and plant it elsewhere . It just lives or dies , without the frills of testament . ( He throws the dirt carelessly aside and it hits one of the workmen , who keep on working . Asquith studies her painting ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FAULKS Since you have already destroyed the view , you might as well dissect mine . ASQUITH BROWN I am a gentleman . SIMONE FAULKS So you say . ASQUITH BROWN I think that your view has great merit . But . May I suggest ? It 's a bit constricted . It requires , considering the recent improvements , a more airy , open feel What 's that there ? SIMONE FAULKS Flowers . ASQUITH BROWN There are none out there . SIMONE FAULKS There were , and should be for flowers signify frailty , the fleeting nature of our lives , Mr. Brown . ( Castle stops his work . He looks about him , a bit at a loss . The two speakers do n't notice him ) ASQUITH BROWN Hmmm . That is why I distrust the Dutch , with their ships of fat tulip bulbs popping up in every nook and cranny . Such obvious fabrications , flowers . Cowslip , tulippa , gilly flower , bah . They cut space into ever smaller pieces . Too insular . By opening up space , by expanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world a little closer to home . It is an illusion as well , but a far more satisfying one . ( Castle tries out a couple of places but there is no privacy for him to piss ) p. 91 SIMONE FAULKS Your throwing up of hills and filling lakes pretends towards a view that is infinite . But it lacks detail , the way an empty sky does . ( Castle finally settles on a place to piss and pisses while Simone and Asquith continue to speak . Then he goes back to work on the machine ) ASQUITH BROWN Ms Faulks . Let me assure you that while my brother and I are cut from the same cloth , we are not exactly of a piece . Like you , at times , such open space leaves me uncertain ; with eyes stuck to the horizon , one could go blind . Nevertheless , it is not merely a question of banishing detail and emptying space but rather of adopting a form more consonant to nature : cleared lines of vision  --  such as Ruysdail and Hobbema created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ASQUITH BROWN  --  because of this exact frailty that you describe . What we are doing here is create something that will last for generations . Permanence , leaning forward into time . SIMONE FAULKS You are destroying this landscape ! ASQUITH BROWN No . We are changing it . And that 's no easy feat . SIMONE FAULKS Damn you . Damn you . ASQUITH BROWN Well then , may I assume that you will not be inclined to have a meal with me this evening ? p. 92 SIMONE FAULKS Certainly not . I do not dine with murderers . And you , Mr. Asquith are a variation on the murderer : one day it 's green , old England , the next day it 's . Muck . Dead muck . ASQUITH BROWN My dear Ms. Falks , the landscape your mourn may have been old , but it was not true . What I 'm doing now is no more artificial than the planting of those hedges a hundred years ago , may they rest in peace . SIMONE FAULKS It will take decades for these fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art you have created , will bring us no visual pleasure or reward for neither you nor I will live to see it . ASQUITH BROWN That is true . But tell me , Ms. Faulks , does one create merely for the rewards of visual or tactile pleasure ? I do not think so . I think it more likely one creates so that one can sleep at night . And even then , sleep does not often come . Because even the faces of those we will love tomorrow , begin to come apart in our hands today . The simple question is how to make the world stay with us a little while so that we are not alone . SIMONE FAULKS Have you no remorse for what was once here , under your feet ? ( Asquith slips in what must be Castle 's piss , of which he is unaware . Castle now continues to try and straighten the tree machine as Jayfort and Castle start to drag it away ) p. 93 SIMONE FAULKS Let me show you something , Mr. Asquith . ( Simone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer , you . ( Castle is surprised but follows her orders . Jayfort and Slip stop dragging the machine off . They watch . Asquith also watches curiously ) SIMONE FAULKS Close your eyes . CASTLE Excuse me , Ma'am , But I  --  ASQUITH BROWN ( Interrupts ) Do as you 're told . ( Castle does so ) SIMONE FAULKS This fellow creature , Mr. Asquith , is nothing like your landscape , your distant water and hills . He will not last . In a few years , he will be food for beetles . Now , he is a flower . A short full bloom , a burst of colour , and then he dies . He looks robust . So does your landscape . But move a little closer , and there is something else . ( Simone , without fuss , pulls open Castle 's shirt so that his chest is bare . Then she bends her head and takes hold of one of his nipples with her teeth and sucks at it a moment . Castle is stunned but keeps himself from jumping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That . ( Castle now fumbles to cover his chest ) That . What has that . To do .

That is what I hope to capture in my vision . ( beat ) God 's world , before you fiddled with it , Mr. Brown , was never meant to last . ( Simone casually returns to her painting .

LEAFEATER - it came apart in my hands . NUTLEY Pink as a baby underneath . LEAFEATER I saw a dead man . Listen to me . My shoulders are covered with blood . Someone is gnawing through my back to reach my heart . NUTLEY Let 's have a look then . Go on . ( In exasperation , Leafeater raises his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no blood or trauma . Nutley inspects him ) p. 97 SCARTH Never been flogged . For sure he 's not one of us . Do n't touch him . Could be carrying . ( Nutley touches Leafeater 's back . Leafeater flinches but lets him do so . With his fingers , he slowly traces down the backbone ) NUTLEY So close below the skin . Your bones . So close but I ca n't touch them . Almost , almost . ( Beat ) But not while you live . ( Leafeater is somewhat disturbed and looks at Nutley 's hand ) NUTLEY No blood on my hands , see ? You 're not bleeding . ( Suddenly he grabs Nutley roughly by the collar ) LEAFEATER You have no idea . Give me your shovel . ( Leafeater sees a shovel nearby so he releases Nutley . He picks it up and breaks it across his knee ) SCARTH Damn you . We 'll pay for that . ( Scarth picks up the broken pieces . He hesitantly pushes Leafeater with the stick end ) Piss off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Scarth is uncertain ) SCARTH You 're upsetting the work . You do n't belong here . ( Leafeater does n't move , so Scarth throws the piece aside in disgust . Nutley moves to Leafeater as though to help him up ) p. 98 SCARTH No . Leave him be . Trouble enough already . Let 's be gone . ( Scarth and Nutley begin to exit ) LEAFEATER Once upon a time ( They stop and listen ) I was a Gentle youth . ( Nutley and Scarth leave . Leafeater remains on his knees , alone . Then Bliss appears ) BLISS I heard you walking . You 've come back from your travels . LEAFEATER ( Gets to his feet ) You 're not here . Go away . BLISS I knew you 'd come back . LEAFEATER Stop following me . You can not hurt me . BLISS Hurrump . Hurrah . Hooray . LEAFEATER No . No . You 're a spoonful of mud I stir in my tea . One swallow and you 're gone . BLISS I hear your throat at night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Click . For years . That dry . You can not sleep . Your shit is wet with blood . LEAFEATER What do you want ? BLISS For you to tell me what happened . For you to call my name . LEAFEATER I ca n't . Go away . p. 99 BLISS Call my name . LEAFEATER I do n't know it . BLISS Not the name but what it sounds like . The story inside the name . I can do it . Can you play follow the leader ? This is the sound of my name : La , la , la . ( Beat ) Do it . LEAFEATER You 're not here . BLISS I have always been here . Do it . There 's no other way . La , la , la . LEAFEATER ( He is silent some moments staring at her , then he copies her sounds ) La , la , la . ( Bliss nods then sings the sound or story of her name . She does not use words , just sounds , beginning with La , la , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Then the song turns dark , almost frightening . Leafeater attempts to follow it . Suddenly Bliss makes a noise that is terrible and ugly . It is louder than her small body can make , and echoes all around them . Leafeater does not attempt to copy this sound . Then there is a silence . Bliss waits for him to copy her ) LEAFEATER ( Like the first notes ) La , la , la . ( Bliss steps towards him menacingly , and he steps back ) BLISS That 's not what happened . LEAFEATER Hush , child . It 's prettier this way . end scene four p. 100 Act 2 , Scene 5 SCENE FIVE ( The diggers and the villagers are meeting . Only Hesp is not there . As they exchange words , the villagers hold out sacks . Into the sacks Jayfort , Castle and Slip put small trees and turf ) VILLAGER FOUR/ALGREN Looks like a weed , mine does .

What asses do you take us for ? These trees are no exchange . JAYFORT In the larger towns , these trees will sell like hotcakes . But make sure you tell them they 're from the colonies . VILLAGER FOUR/ALGREN Just a minute . Here 's the main point : We need tools . Something we can sell . ELLEN That 's right . These trees are worthless . Get us tools . ( The diggers continue to hand out the saplings ) VILLAGER TWO No . We ca n't steal from Lord Heywood . He 's never stole from us . ELLEN The tools belong to that gardener . It wo n't hurt our lord . p. 101 VILLAGER THREE I 'm going to plant mine in the new gardens when we move . SLIP That 's a  --  CASTLE pudding-porket pine .

( The two sides just stare at one anther ) ELLEN ( To Jayfort ) You a slave then ? JAYFORT No . I 'm not . ELLEN We do n't see many of you in these parts . JAYFORT Thousands of us down in London . All kinds . Slaves , free , half-free . You people once had an interest to touch me ? ( He holds out his arm ) p. 102 VILLAGER TWO Of course , not . Ellen . That would be rude . JAYFORT Just move slow and it 's all right . ( Ellen moves closer and slowly reaches out and touches Jayfort 's skin , hesitantly . They look at one another . Suddenly Villager One makes incoherent little shrieks that sets everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To Ellen ) Hey , good woman . We 've done our deal . Now it 's time to celebrate . ( Slip holds out his hand . When Ellen wo n't take it , he claps out a rhythm . The Villagers are distracted a moment and look on with interest . Slip begins to dance . It is a lively dance though begins rather awkwardly . Suddenly , he slips and falls . ) VILLAGERS ALL Stupid idiot . Pillock . What a clown etc . ( But Jayfort starts clapping the rhythm again , and then Castle . Slip gets up and tries again . What Slip dances is a kind of wild , almost obscene sailors dance  --  and though he is not very graceful , he makes up for it with exuberance . Without warning , Jayfort joins in . He dances this sailor 's dance as well , though slightly differently . Then Castle joins in too . Now the villagers join in clapping . For some moments the three men dance together . The villagers are impressed . Nutley appears with his rifle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nutley carries a sack . He opens the sack and spills the bones , and the skull , into a pile in front of them .

But you ca n't bury a thing that 's awake . All night . Ca n't sleep . In my ear , I hear them say : We lived . We lived . Ding . Ding . Ding .

ASQUITH BROWN Look , the bones had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common to find bones when you dig . HESP TURNER Not on this land . No wrong was ever done on this estate . The village is upset . And frightened . ASQUITH BROWN ( Only now facing her , with a slight threat ) Then tell them the matter is being taken care of . Nothing to worry about . Do you understand ? HESP TURNER Your brother may have the ear of the King but it is you who are digging in the mud . You should be careful not to offend any more than you have . ( Taken aback , but amused ) ASQUITH BROWN Well , well . I regret having offended you at all . Lord Heywood has already ordered that the remains brought to the churchyard for a proper burial . But I do n't like threats . Especially from you p. 105 HESP TURNER Trouble is not what I want .

Asquith leads her to a spot where she can view the fields below ) Now look . Voila . ( Hesp gasps . She is awed ) Where once there was nothing but land as flat and ugly as a tin plate , you have ( He sweeps with his arm ) this .

What I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ( beat ) speak to your friends in the village . Encourage them to be willing to move . HESP TURNER I have already done so . I make no secret that I want the selling of our leases . And almost half of us , we 're happy to move . I think it 's a good plan . ASQUITH BROWN For that I am grateful . ( He attempts to embrace her but she backs away ) HESP TURNER Mr. Asquith . Please . I. I. ASQUITH BROWN What is it you want then ? I do n't understand you . Tell me . HESP TURNER I want you  --  ASQUITH BROWN Yes . HESP TURNER I want you  --  ASQUITH BROWN And I want you . HESP TURNER  --  to open your pants . ASQUITH BROWN ( Unsettled ) What ?

ASQUITH BROWN And for such an act of debasement , what shall I receive in return ? HESP TURNER The pleasure of me watching you . Go on . Touch yourself . Please . Yes . Look at me . Look at my face . Can you not see how I want to touch you ? ( Asquith masturbates as she watches . ) I can hear you breath now , even from this distance . Yes . As though you were about to choke .

She pushes it against the dress cloth over her crotch ) HESP TURNER Here . Touch my frock . Just to look at you , I am wet even on the outside .

Hesp takes in a deep breath and holds it ) end scene six p. 109 Act 2 , Scene 7 SCENE SEVEN ( Nutley , Scarth , Slip , Jayfort , and Castle sit together , taking a rest from digging .

JAYFORT Listen . Here 's this outlaw  --  NUTLEY Satan . JAYFORT Right . And he 's an outcast who 's trying to get into this this royal park because the king or lord has put him in a goal for rebelling . He escapes and goes after the king 's prize deer . NUTLEY Adam and Eve . JAYFORT But he 's picked up by the king 's patrol led by his right hand man , Gabriel . The point is , maybe the lowest and the worst of us  --  NUTLEY That 's you lot .

I mean if she 's got sheets of skin peeling away in slivers that smell of pike , perch , and dimplewhipper fish then , well , you 've got nothing to hide . VILLAGER TWO Least you 've got a full house . Two of mine turned black overnight . Pulled them off in the morning . ( sings ) One , two , and it 's off to work I go . NUTLEY And the bones ?

And so I did.One night I caught a poacher in the North forest . Hardly a man , what was left of him . Birds for eyes , that scared . Be still , be still , I told him . He cried so hard his tooth fell out . It broke my brother 's heart to know this thief was no outsider like the rest of them , but a villager he 'd trusted .

As she does so , elsewhere on stage , a hanging figure is discernible , but just barely , as though it were hanging in a different time . The figure is suspended from the air or perhaps a limb we can not see . Only his clothes are visible ; his body seems to have disappeared . This vision is both beautiful and disturbing ) HESP TURNER Can you not paint what it used to look like , out there ? SIMONE FAULKS It is difficult to remember .
