I thought war was hard to explain to a child . But compared to this , war is easy . When my daughters saw the pictures flashed on the Today show and wanted to know " Why are there wires attached to that man 's hands ? " , I could not bring myself to explain that this is designed to maim a man 's soul : in a culture that sanctifies masculine pride and sexual privacy , you strip him and make him masturbate in front of a mocking female captor , or put him on a leash or pretend you are going to electrocute him . But I did have to explain that the bad guys  --  this time  --  were seven U.S. soldiers , of whom it might be said that seldom has such harm been done to so many by so few . <P> This " does not represent the America that I know , " President Bush said of the events at Abu Ghraib , and how tempting it was to go there . The pictures ca n't be real . If they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are typical , this ca n't be America  --  unless , perhaps , you are Rush Limbaugh , who invited listeners to identify with the frustration the soldiers must have felt being shot at by the ungrateful Iraqi people ; so naturally they felt the need to " blow some steam off , " to " have a good time . " Others noted that there was less outcry when Saddam was doing the torturing , or argued that " they would do the same to us " if they had a chance . When we are reduced to insisting that our depravity is n't as bad as the other guy 's , we have fallen deep into a pit of moral equivalence that reveals what we have lost . <P> You could track the stages of grief , because something precious had surely died : a hope that the world might one day come to see Americans as we see ourselves . Instead , we have had to see ourselves as the world sees us . On the very site where Saddam drilled holes in prisoners ' hands or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of planting new values , harvested the ones already there . I heard the pain last week of people who had supported the war out of principle , who continued to support it after weapons were n't found and soldiers kept getting killed and other nations pulled out , and did so because , as Brigadier General Kimmitt put it last week , " we came here to help . " That meant at the very least ensuring that Abu Ghraib was no longer a torture chamber . Now the front page of a Baghdad paper shows the defiled prisoners and the caption : " This is the freedom and democracy that Bush promised us . " Psychologically , if not in fact , these pictures shred the last good reason to feel righteous about having gone to war .
