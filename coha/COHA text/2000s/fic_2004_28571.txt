Chapter One " Mackenzie , you are the luckiest damned guy in the world , " Todd Herly said as he hefted his golf bag onto his shoulder . Alec Mackenzie hid a smile . " I 'm going to tell your wife you 're cussing again . " " Go ahead , " his friend snapped as they walked toward the Riviera Country Club 's parking lot , their cleats clicking rhythmically on the concrete path . " When the kids are n't around , I can do whatever I want . " Alec laughed , shifting his own clubs higher on his shoulder . " Sure you can , buddy . " " Anyway , that 's not what we 're talking about . We 're talking about how scoring the Santa Margarita contract makes you the luckiest man alive . " " Luck had nothing to do with it . I won this contract fair and square . I worked for this , " he said , indicating the thick manila envelope in his hand , " which is more than I can say for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw together an inflated proposal that probably did n't even make it onto the client 's radar . " Todd , the man who was both his best friend and his most ardent and talented professional rival , gasped in predictable outrage . Alec just grinned . " Of course , " he said , " when it came down to the wire , my charm , charisma and good looks probably helped clinch the deal . " " I doubt it , " Todd shot back . " Although , I 'm sure that 's what you used to get that tall , cool drink of water to hand over her phone number at the benefit Saturday night . " " Jealous ? " Alec joked as they approached their cars . " Hardly . Chelle would eat me alive if she even suspected that I 'd looked twice at a woman that gorgeous . " " Chelle is that gorgeous , " Alec said and meant it . Todd and his wife were perfect for each other , a regular storybook romance . But Alec was a man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way . Not that his bachelor status was in jeopardy . Far from it . In fact , the woman he 'd met the other night was going to be just the ticket for a few weeks of fun . She was beautiful , had legs up to here and ... well , that pretty much made her ideal . Alec slipped his prized clubs into the passenger seat of his convertible Ferrari , " he said , tapping a teasing finger on the envelope , " to the office . " Todd frowned as he slammed the trunk of the big Mercedes he 'd recently bought because - as he 'd sheepishly explained to Alec - it was the perfect sedan for his family of four . " I take it back , Mackenzie , " Todd said . " You 're not the luckiest man alive , you 're the most competitive . You always have been . " Alec climbed into the fastest sports car on the market and slid the contract that named his firm the victor in a protracted battle for the most coveted architectural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Winning is what matters , Todd , " he said as he fired up the engine and threw the car into reverse . " The only thing that matters . " Todd opened his mouth to protest , but Alec just waved and sped away with The Eagles'Greatest Hits pouring out of the stereo 's speakers . By the time the band had launched into the opening notes of " Desperado , " Alec was halfway to his Santa Monica office . It does n't get any better than this , he thought as he sped down a winding , tree-shaded patch of Sunset Boulevard and hummed along with the old tune . Breakfast at the country club with his best friend and a solid hour at the driving range would have been enough to make for a great morning . But the arrival of a messenger from the office bearing the news that his firm had won the project had been the best possible interruption . He pulled into a parking space under his company 's building and opened the glove compartment . Todd was right . Alec had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a competitive one at least a mile and a half wide . But this , he thought as he grabbed the contract , he deserved . Alec was n't shy about his abilities as an architect so he 'd only been half kidding when he 'd told Todd that his talent had won the contract . He was , he thought as he stepped inside the waiting elevator and punched the button for the top floor , very good at what he did . And he and his team had put together an extremely competitive bid . But now that the contract was in his hands , he realized that in spite of his confidence - some would say ego - he still could n't quite believe it . Just off the southern California coast on the tiny island of Santa Margarita , seven historical but decaying mansions were going to be restored to their former glory and reopened as five-star bed and breakfasts . And he and his company were going to do the job . " Mackenzie Architectural Revivals , " he heard his receptionist say into the phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I direct your call ? " He winked at her and headed for his office . Yessir , this was shaping up to be one hell of a day . His assistant , Daisy Kincaid , was n't at her desk when he walked by , but he only had to take one step into his office to see she 'd already been there . Neatly arranged on his prized Frank Lloyd Wright desk were all of life 's little essentials : a cup of hot coffee , a couple of his favorite Krispy Kremes , the day 's Los Angeles Times and a stack of trade magazines . He sat down , propped his feet up on the desk , put his head back and smiled , really smiled , for the first time in weeks . " Did you get it ? " Alec looked up and saw Daisy leaning against the door frame . She , too , wore a wide , delighted smile , and for a second , just one second , he saw something he 'd never seen before . She looked almost ... pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , showing a flash of soft , smoky colored T-shirt beneath , her dark-brown eyes danced happily behind her wire-framed glasses , and curly strands of her chestnut hair had escaped her perpetual twist , suddenly making him feel like he wanted to pull out the pins one by one . He shook his head to scatter the image . A trick of the light , he thought , or maybe just another sign that today was magical because during the three years she 'd worked for him , he 'd never once been tempted to use the word pretty to describe Daisy . Loyal , hardworking , efficient , smart , resourceful , responsible - those were the words he would use . Nope , she was n't pretty , but for what she did so well here at his company , she was exactly what he needed . He swung his legs off the desk , sat up and motioned for her to enter . " Thanks for sending a messenger to the driving range with the contract , Daze . How did you know I 'd be there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
