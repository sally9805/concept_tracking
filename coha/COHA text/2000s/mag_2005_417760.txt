Today 's photo printers produce great snapshots and boast helpful new features . But with some , ink costs could leave you seeing red . We test 11 contenders , starting at $150 . By Paul Jasper Photograph PICTURED ABOVE : The Sony DPP-EX50 ( left ) and HP Photosmart 8450 . Photograph PICTURED ABOVE : The Sony DPP-EX50 ( left ) and HP Photosmart 8450. // PHOTO PRINTERS HAVE greatly improved their print quality over the past several years , as most of the printers we 've seen attest . They also cost less today than when they first appeared : The models in this roundup range in price from $150 to $399 . But the ink and paper they use still tend to cost an arm and a leg . Most people purchase a photo printer in order to avoid the effort of going to an old-fashioned photo mart . However , in our tests of ii printers-7 full-size desktop models and 4 smaller snapshot units-most made the photo mart and online photo printing services look like good deals . The three major chains we surveyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an average of 28 cents per print , with in-store pickup . To make 20 prints , the four online outlets we looked at ( Ofoto , Snapfish , Shutterfly , and Yahoo Photos ) charge an average of 35 cents each print , including shipping . In contrast , full-size photo printers averaged 66 cents per print and snapshot printers averaged 55 cents each , though costs varied widely , as detailed in the chart appearing on page 84 . The Imaging Products Lab at the Rochester Institute of Technology tested ink and paper consumption for each inkjet printer on behalf of PC World . In ! PL 's tests , the Epson PictureMate was by far the cheapest at 23 cents per 4-by-6-inch print . The next cheapest option , the Dell Photo Printer 540 , costs 39 cents per print-but to reach that cost , you must buy a $47 bundle of three print packs . Of the full-size printers , the most reasonable was the Canon Pixma IP4000R , at 46 cents per print . The Lexmark P915 , on the other hand , will put a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents ' worth of ink and paper per snapshot-and that was with its high-yield cartridges installed . Print speeds also run the gamut from perky to poky . In speed tests conducted by the PC World Test Center , Canon 's Pixma IP8500 printed 4-by-6-inch snapshots faster than any other printer-averaging just 39 seconds-but its text speed lagged . The Epson models were particularly slow at printing text documents , while the Lexmark P915 turned in a blistering 7.4 pages per minute . Most of the inkjet printers here use dyebased inks , which are absorbed into the paper , whereas models that use pigmentbased inks bond the inks to the surface of the paper . The one model that uses only pigment-based inks is the Epson Stylus Photo R800 , but the two Canon printers and the Lexmark P915 use pigment-based black ink only for printing text . PORTS AND PAPER OPTIONS ALMOST ALL OF the printers offer a way to print photos without the help of a PC . Every printer except the Epson R800 has a direct-print port that lets you print from a compatible digital camera . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; only the two Canons and the Epson R800 lack them . And most of the printers have an LCD screen for previewing your images and making simple edits , such as cropping and removing red-eye . Having a photo printer with a built-in media card reader can also be convenient for uploading images to your PC . When you insert the media card from your camera , it shows up in Windows as a removable disk drive . Several models , including those from Dell and HP , also let you print images from a USB flash drive plugged into their direct-print port . The Epson Stylus Photo R320 is the ultimate in connectivity , letting you hook up a wide variety of USB devices , such as Zip drives and CD burners , for archiving your images . For expanded reviews online , see find.pcworld.com/46940 . FULL-SIZE PHOTO PRINTERS OF THE SHVEN photo printers we tested , all except the Lexmark P915 earned our top score for their prints on letter-size glossy paper . However , both the HP Photosmart 8150 and the Canon Pixma IP4000R had difficulty feeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banding near the trailing edge of otherwise good-looking snapshots . The HP Photosmart 8450 rated best overall because , in addition to printing near-perfect photos , it 's loaded with features . It comes with an ethernet port and many other amenities , such as media card slots , a color LCD , and the capability to make banner-size prints . It also comes with HP Image Zone , the most comprehensive software package included with the printers here . Though it uses up 600MB of hard-drive space , the software offers many good tools for editing and sharing photos . But high ink and paper costs kept the Photosmart 8450 from earning our Best Buy honor . Despite its problems with 4-by-6 paper , we awarded the Canon IP4000R our Best Buy . The IP4000R is inexpensive , its cost per page of 46 cents is the lowest of the full-size printers we tested , and you can achieve stellar results printing 4-by-6 photos on letter-size paper . // Photo Printers : Big and Small // Photo Printers : Big and Small // HP Photosmart 8450 THE $250 PHOTOSMART 8450 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed sharp details and natural colors . Despite its moderate price , the Photosmart 8450 offers many features for operation both with and without a PC . You can preview your pictures on the 2.5-inch color LCD and make basic edits using the buttons on the control panel . You can print from a media card , or directly from a compatible digital camera via the directprint port . Also , like four other models here , the Photosmart 8450 's direct-print port reads USB flash drives . The Photosmart 8450 is one of two printers we tested that have an ethernet port . Alternatively , you can connect the Photosmart 8450 to a PC using its USB 2.0 port , or add a Bluetooth adapter ( $50 ) to send it photos from compatible camera phones and PDAs . Photograph HP 'S PHOTOSMART 8450 has media card slots that support most formats . // Ongoing costs for the Photosmart 8450 could be steep , however . According to ! PL 's tests , photo paper and ink cost an average of 83 cents per snapshot-21 cents more than the average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features for editing and organizing photos , though photos emerged slowly . The Photosmart 8450 took over 2 minutes to make a 4-by-6-inch print at best-quality settings ; only the Lexmark P915 and the Epson PictureMate took longer . UPSHOT : The Photosmart 8450 's long list of features make it a good choice for small offices and networked homes , though ink and paper costs are high . Canon Pixma IP8500 Photograph THE CANON PIXMA IP8500 uses eight ink cartridges , including red and green inks as well as photo cyan and photo magenta . // LIKE THE HP PHOTOSMART 8450 , the Canon Pixma IP8500 generated greatlooking photos and very attractive borderless snapshots , but it costs a hundred dollars more , at $350 . The extra money does save you time when printing snapshots : The Pixma IP8500 printed a 4-by-6-inch photo in just 39 seconds , more than three times faster than the Photosmart 8450 . However , the IP8500 printed graphics on plain paper at a below-average 1.4 ppm . The unit 's ink and paper costs are lower than average , at 57 cents per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the photos this model printed on lettersize paper . In addition , the Pixma IP8500 printed attractive color graphics on plain paper ; the prints looked quite sharp , with sufficient detail in darker areas . If you plan to perform all your image editing on your PC , you wo n't mind the IPSSOO 's lack of an LCD and media card slots . There is a port for printing directly from a compatible camera , though you ca n't use the port to upload images to your computer , as you can with several other models here . The IP8500 holds a lot of paper-up to 300 sheets-and provides a built-in duplexer . UPSHOT : The IP8500 prints photos very quickly , generates appealing color graphics , and has below-average ink and paper costs ; direct printing features are limited . Canon Pixma IP4000R THE $230 PIXMA IP4000R is the only printer we tested that comes with an 802.1 Ig wireless connection , though both the Epson Stylus Photo R800 and R320 offer an 802.1Ig option . The Pixma IP4000R does n't have media card slots or an LCD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ethernet connection . Photograph THECANON IP4000Rhasan ethernet port , plus wireless connectivity . // The Pixma IP4000R produced prints more cheaply than any other full-size printer we tested . Ink and paper cost 46 cents per 4-by-6-inch borderless print . Only the Epson PictureMate 's prints have a lower cost . The unit uses five individual ink cartridges , employing just three primary colors plus a dye-based black ink for photos and a pigment-based black ink for printing text . Nonetheless , the IP4000R printed very attractive , vividly colored photos on lettersize paper that impressed us as much as those printed by models using more inks . However , on its snapshot prints we noticed fine banding toward the trailing edge , where the printer apparently had difficulty feeding the smaller paper . Color graphics on plain paper suffered from heavy-handed use of the pigment black ink , which seemed to cause a pixelated effect in some areas . The IP4000R is a good all-around performer . It was the quickest at printing color graphics , at 2.5 ppm . At its bestquality settings , our 4-by-6-inch photo sample @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sibling , the Canon Pixma IP8500 . Both Canons were noticeably quieter than the other printers we tested . The IP4000R can hold 300 sheets of paper : up to 150 sheets each in the bottom drawer and in the upper feeder . The built-in duplexer enables two-sided printing , but the first side has to dry before printing begins on the other side . UPSHOT : Its fast print speeds and many features make the IP4000R a good buy , plus its printing costs are low . Epson Stylus Photo R80C THE $399 EPSON Stylus Photo R800 is n't meant for casual shutterbugs ; it 's clearly designed for photographers who prefer to edit their images on a PC monitor , not on a small LCD . Unlike every other printer in this roundup , the R800 does n't have a direct-print port , and it lacks an LCD . But it is the only printer we tested that has a FireWire port . The R800 uses a total of eight cartridges , but only five colors . To the standard set of cyan , magenta , and yellow inks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other cartridges supply photo black , matte black ( for text ) , and a gloss overcoat . The unit printed the least impressive color graphics on plain paper , but glossy photos looked gorgeous , with sharp detail and rich colors . Snapshots were also attractive-and inexpensive . IPL tallied the RSOO 's ink and paper costs at a below-average 56 cents per 4-by-6-inch print . Photograph EPSON 'S R800 does n't have an LCD , but it does have a FireWire port . // The printer applies a gloss overcoat to photos in light-colored areas to prevent dull patches . Though we saw the coating in the company 's sample photos , we could not detect it on our test photo . The R800 printed graphics at 1.8 ppm , which was about average . Snapshots printed in just under 2 minutes , or 19 seconds longer than the average . The R800 can print on rolls of photo paper that are either 4 inches or 8.3 inches wide . Pressing a button pushes finished photos out for you to cut off . You do n't have to remove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvement on Epson 's previous roll-printing models . Also , a dedicated tray feeds a specially coated CD or DVD through the paper path . One minor inconvenience : To print on a CD or DVD , you must reposition the output tray . UPSHOT : The R800 offers unique features such as a roll feeder and a Fire Wire port , and it prints to CD/DVD discs-but you get high print quality only when using full-size glossy photo paper . HP Photosmart 8150 THE $200 HP PHOTOSMART 8150 has a 2.5-inch color LCD screen , as well as four media card slots that accommodate all the popular card formats . You can also print directly from a compatible camera connected to the 8150 's directprint port , or from a USB flash drive loaded with images . The 8150 's paper drawer contains as many as 100 sheets of plain paper , up to legal size . A second feeder holds up to 20 sheets of 4-by-6-inch photo paper . Also , you can add a 250-sheet paper drawer or a duplexer ; each option costs $80 . Photograph HP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in others . // The 8150 uses up to six inks with two cartridges installed : a tricolor cartridge and a photo ink cartridge . For printing text documents , you can insert a black-ink cartridge ; for printing black-and-white photos , HP offers a photo-gray cartridge . In IPL 's tests , snapshots cost a pricierthan-average 74 cents each . Though the 8150 made high-quality prints on glossy letter-size paper , 4-by-6-inch glossy prints were marred by dithering in light areas and by banding near the trailing edge . The 8150 printed graphics quickly , at 2.1 ppm . Snapshots printed in 102 seconds , just below the average of 97 seconds . HP 's Image Zone software offers many tools for organizing and sharing photos . UPSHOT : The 8150 's extensive features make it well suited for amateur photographers , though printing costs are high . Epson Stylus Photo R320 THE $200 EPSON STYLUS PHOTO R320 provides a lot of versatility . It has media card slots , and its direct-print port lets you offload photos to a host of devices , including Zip drives , CD and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S R320 prints onto coated CD/DVD discs , and can write to an external optical drive . // The R320 proved economical , using up 49 cents ' worth of ink and paper per snapshot . Using its six individual ink cartridges , the R320 printed excellent glossy photos on letter-size paper as well as superb snapshots . But its fuzzy text prints were the worst of the bunch , and its color graphics on plain paper looked blurry . The R320 printed a snapshot in 108 seconds , 11 seconds slower than the average . The R320 has two LCD screens , but its color LCD is only 1.5 inches wide . The 2.5-inch monochrome LCD shows menus . We think one 2.5-inch color LCD would have been more useful . The R320 skimps on paper capacity , offering only a 120-sheet paper feeder and no optional paper tray or duplexer . An optional Bluetooth adapter costs $69 . UPSHOT : The R320 prints superb glossy photos and works with various media , but prints on plain paper are lackluster . Lexmark P915 THE LEXMARK P915 , at $150 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media card slots , a direct-print port , and a 2.5-inch color LCD display for previewing photographs and delving into menus . When it 's not listing menus , the LCD indicates ink levels as a series of bars . Photograph THE LEXMARK P915 's LCD shows ink levels-but not the high ink cost of 57 cents per snapshot. // Those bars could represent a lot of money . Even using Lexmark 's high-capacity ink cartridges , the P915 had the highest ink costs ; add to that the highest paper costs of any printer we tested , and snapshots cost almost a dollar apiece . That 's more than four times the per-print cost of Epson 's PicrureMate , which had the lowest cost of consumables . One potential plus is that the P915 's ink cartridges , like the HP 's , have printheads built in , which in theory prevents clogged nozzles . The P915 uses two cartridges supplying six inks : a tricolor cartridge with dye-based inks and a photo ink cartridge with pigment-based inks . The P915 turned in the fastest text printing speed , 7.4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graphics speed was among the slowest , and the P915 took over 2 minutes to print our test snapshot at best-quality settings . The P915 's print quality was a disappointment across the board . Colors in photos looked muted , and fine horizontal banding was evident . The black-and-white photo was particularly grainy , and earned a Poor score for its dull appearance . On plain paper , color graphics looked fuzzy , but with decent contrast in shadows . In text documents , some letters were so fuzzy that they seemed to cast a shadow . UPSHOT : The P915 has a low price , but its features do n't make up for the poor print quality and expensive ink and paper . SNAPSHOT PRINTERS SNAPSHOT PRINTERS offer an easy way to print 4-by-6-inch photos . Three of the units we tested almost matched the high print quality of the best full-size printers . But one model , the Dell Photo Printer 540 , was particularly disappointing , producing less vibrant colors than the others . Epson PictureMate THE $199 PICTUREMATE is n't the smallest or lightest snapshot printer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portability . The PictureMate does n't run on batteries , though you can buy a car adapter for $50 . It prints only on 4-by-6-inch paper , but it will print two wallet-size photos on one sheet . We found the PictureMate a pleasure to use-and the least expensive to operate . Epson advertises that prints cost 29 cents each ; its $29 print packs include 100 sheets of glossy paper and an ink cartridge intended to print at least 100 photos . To see how far you might be able to stretch your dollar , IPL fed the printer extra paper ( 16 cents per sheet ) until the print quality degraded noticeably . This reduced the per-print cost to 23 cents . No other printer approached that level of economy . Photograph EPSON PICTUREMATE 'S ink cartridge slides into the back . Using extra paper reduced print costs to 23 cents each . // The PictureMate has a direct-print port and memory card slots , and it can print via a Bluetooth module ( $69 ) . Also , it can write files to an external CD burner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ print a proof sheet and select images by number . In our test photos , colors were bright , and details popped out in sharp focus . However , to print our test photo the PictureMate took 2 minutes and 16 seconds-longer than any other snapshot printer . UPSHOT : The PictureMate is a good choice for very low-cost snapshots , as long as you do n't need prints in a hurry . HP Photosmart 375 Compact Photo Printer SNAPSHOT PRINTERS do n't get any more portable than the $200 HP Photosmart 375 . This petite printer weighs just 2.6 pounds , and is less than 5 inches thick and 4.5 inches tall ; an optional $80 rechargeable battery tucks neatly inside the printer . With its silver top and white side panels , the 375 looks like a four-slice toaster for mini cocktail bread . A 2.5-inch LCD flips up from the top , and the front panel folds down to act as an output tray , revealing four memory card slots . The rear panel tilts back to expose a 20-sheet input tray . The quality of the photos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ par with those from two other snapshot printers we looked at , the Epson PictureMate and the Sony DPP-EX50 . We liked the rich colors and sharp details in most of the Photosmart 375 's test prints , but noted that the photo did n't look as smooth as the same image printed by its full-size sibling , the Photosmart 8450 . Both HP models gave the sky and water in that image a purplish tinge , but the Photosmart 375 's prints also showed a slight band across the trailing edge of the paper . The Photosmart 375 uses a tricolor cartridge ( or a gray-ink cartridge for printing black-and-white photos ) . Running costs are high , however : Ink and paper costs came to a total of 81 cents per 4-by-6-inch snapshot in IPL 's tests-higher than our other three snapshot printers . Photograph THE HP PHOTOSMART 375 is petite and has a flip-up LCD , and its side panels fold out to serve as paper trays . // The Photosmart 375 printed at below-average speeds , printing a 4-by-6-inch snapshot in 1 minute and 47 seconds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ print the same image . The printer comes with the same highquality software package that accompanies HP 's desktop inkjets . Also available are a $50 Bluetooth adapter and a carlighter power adapter that costs $40 . UPSHOT : Printing costs for the HP Photosmart 375 are high-but this small printer is the only model here offering an optional battery pack or car adapter , making it ideal for taking along on the road . Sony Digital Photo Printer DPP-EX50 YOU CAN DRIVE THE $180 Sony DPP-EX50 dye-sublimation printer , like the other snapshot printers we tested , from a direct-print-capable camera ; the printer also has memory card slots ( but only for Memory Stick and CompactFlash cards ) . Many people , though , will want to connect this model to a TV set-a capability unique to the Sony in this group . The TV displays photos and print menus , and options for creating postcards or multiple-image layouts . Also , you can convert images to sepia tone or grayscale , and apply other effects . When you do link to a computer , you 'll probably want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your images because Sony 's Windows driver lacks many common options , such as color and density adjustment and red-eye reduction . Photograph SONY 'S DPP-EX50 has a control panel for PC-free use , and it works with a TV. // The DPP-EX50 can print to three sizes of paper : 4-by-6-inch , 3.5-by-5-inch , and 3.5-by-4-inch ; all three work with the same cassette , which slips into an opening on the front of the case . A 25-sheet pack of 4-by-6-inch paper with an ink ribbon costs $17 , or 68 cents per print . The $43 value pack with 75 sheets reduces the per-print cost to 57 cents , but that 's still more than double the 23-cent per-print cost of the Epson PictureMate . The DPP-EX50 printed a snapshot from a PC in 88 seconds , faster than most full-size printers we tested . The print showed very sharp details and the luminous quality that we have come to expect from dye-sub prints . UPSHOT : The Sony DPP-EX50 's TV interface is unique , but you 'll get lower-cost prints with the Epson PicrureMate . Dell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dell 's $189 Photo Printer 540 was the quickest , but it also turned out the least attractive photos . Noticeable light and dark bands appeared close to the trailing edge . As you 'd expect with a dye-sublimation unit , tonal changes looked smooth , but we saw richer colors from most of the other models . Also , our test prints were aligned improperly , leaving white bands on the paper 's top and right edges . Photograph THE DELL 540 's paper has perforated tabs , which leave a rough edge when removed . // This dye-sub printer generated 4-by-6-inch photos in just over a minute-more than 30 seconds faster than the average . Like all of the other snapshot printers we looked at , the Photo Printer 540 has both a direct-print port and slots for memory cards , though it lacks an XD-Picture Card slot . One plus : The direct-print port can also read USB flash drives . The unit 's 2.5-inch color LCD screen is convenient for previewing photos and making simple adjustments . Buying Dell 's print packs individually makes the cost per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $47 bundle of three packs , you reduce the cost to 39 cents per print , which beats the cost of all of the full-size photo inkjets we tested . This printer is small and light enough for easy travel , weighing only 3.6 pounds and measuring 7.5 by 5.5 by 2.7 inches . Though the device ca n't run on batteries , the power adapter is compact . UPSHOT : The Dell 540 is very fast , and costs are low if you buy supplies in large quantities , but print quality is subpar . Sidebar SHOW ME THE MONEY : How Ink and Paper Costs Add Up THE TEST : On behalf of PC World , the Imaging Products Laboratory at the Rochester Institute of Technology evaluated the ink and paper costs for printing 4-by-6-inch glossy photos . IPL printed a series of four 4-by-6-inch images , using each printer 's " best " or " photo " mode , and the vendor 's recommended glossy photo paper . WHAT WE FOUND : The good news is that you can print beautiful photos without getting bilked for supplies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 49 cents each-well below the average of 62 cents for all printers . In contrast , the Lexmark P915 printed less-attractive photos than any other desktop printer , yet its cost per page was 97 cents . Desktop printers using tricolor cartridges averaged 85 cents per snapshot ; models using individual cartridges averaged 52 cents per print . The lowest cost came from the Epson PictureMate , which uses a single cartridge with six inks . For more details on ! PL 's testing , go to find.pcworld.com/46916 . Sidebar - Eric Butterfield Sidebar In Search of TOP-NOTCH SNAPS THOUGH SIX OF the seven full-size photo printers earned our top score for their glossy photos printed on lettersize paper , not all of those models printed equally impressive snapshots . The Canon Pixma IP4000R and the HP Photosmart 8150 both printed 4by-6-inch photos that showed banding near the trailing edge , which may be due to problems feeding the smaller paper . Some textures in the IP4000R 's snapshot did n't look as smooth as they did on larger paper . Details in the 8150 's 4-by-6-inch print looked oversharpened-edges appeared jagged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Outstanding for their snapshots , though four of the full-size printers did . Other considerations for the finicky : Using borderless settings does n't guarantee a borderless print . Even though our image measured exactly 4 by 6 inches , and we selected a borderless print in the print driver , the Sony DPP-EX50 left a narrow white strip along two edges of its prints ; similarly , the Dell 540 did n't print to the top edge of its paper . Dye-subs were n't the only models to have sizing problems : Both the HP 8450 and the Epson R320 trimmed about an eighth of an inch from at least one edge of our image in their borderless prints . - Eric Butterfield Author Affiliation Paul Jasper is a technology consultant and freelance writer in San Francisco ; Eric Butterfield is an associate editor for PC World and writes the online column The Print Shop . // <p>
