Like grains of sand grinding inside the oyster , Like pearls being formed from the grains ; Still waiting , though in unbearable patience Still believing , though almost in disbelief . ZHOU LIANGPEI SEATTLE , WASHINGTON November Archer Donovan was n't easily surprised . It was a hangover from his previous line of work when surprised men often ended up dead . Yet the unique , peacock-and-rainbow radiance of the teardrop black pearl Teddy Yamagata was holding out did more than surprise Archer . It shocked him . He had n't seen a black pearl with such color for seven years . That particular pearl had been clutched in a dead man 's hand . Or nearly dead . Archer had fought his way through the riot in time to pull his half brother out of the mess and get him to a hospital in another , safer place . Long ago , far away , in another country . Thank God . Archer had done everything in his power to bury that part of his past . Years later he still was shoveling . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was , his previous undercover life had a nasty habit of popping up and casting shadows on his present civilian life . The proof of it was gleaming on the palm of Hawaii 's foremost pearl collector and trader . Teddy was n't in Hawaii now . He had flown to Seattle with a case full of special pearls to show Archer . The extraordinary black pearl was one of them . " Unusual color , " Archer said neutrally . Peering through the thick , blended lenses of his glasses , Teddy measured the expression of the man who was a sometime competitor in the pearl trade , an occasional client , and an invariably reliable appraiser . If Archer was particularly interested in the tear-shaped black pearl , nothing showed on his face . He could have been looking at a picture of Teddy 's grandchildren . " You must be a helluva poker player , " Teddy said . " Are we playing poker ? " " You 've got your game face on . At least I think you do . Hard to tell under all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cheek . He had given up shaving several months ago . He still was n't quite certain why . One morning he just had picked up his razor , looked at it as though it was a remnant of the Spanish Inquisition , and dropped the blade in the trash . The fact that it was six years to the day since he had quit working for Uncle Sam might have had something to do with it . Whatever , his beard had grown into a short black continuation of his short black hair . And if there were a few gray hairs among the black , tough . The dead did n't age . Only the living did . " Must be hot when you go to Tahiti , " Teddy said . " It 's always hot there . " " I meant the beard . " " I never sent it to Tahiti . " Teddy abandoned subtlety and tried the in-your-face approach . " What do you think of the pearl ? " " South Sea , maybe fourteen millimeters , teardrop , unblemished surface , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His black eyes nearly vanished into lines of laughter . " It 's goddamn spectacular and you know it ! It 's like ... like ... " " Molten rainbows under black ice . " Teddy 's thin black eyebrows shot up and he pounced . " You do like it . " Archer shrugged . " I like a lot of pearls . It 's a weakness of mine . " " In my dreams you 're weak . What 's the pearl worth ? " " Whatever you can get for it . " Archer 's cool , gray-green glance stopped Teddy 's immediate protest . " What do you really want to know ? " " What the damn thing 's worth , " he said , exasperated . " You 're the best , most honest judge of pearls that I know . " " Where did you get it ? " " From a man who got it from a woman who got it from a man in Kowloon , who supposedly got it from someone in Tahiti . I 've looked for that man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He 's not there . But if you buy the pearl , I 'll give you the names . " " Are there more ? " " I was hoping you could tell me . " " I 'll bet you were . " Archer looked at the stainless steel space-age clock his father had brought back from Germany and placed in the front room of the series of suites that were the Donovan family residence in downtown Seattle . Two o'clock in Seattle . Wednesday afternoon . Autumn closing in on winter . Where the black pearl had come from , it was early morning . Thursday . Spring closing in on summer . What went wrong , Len ? Archer asked silently . Why , after seven years , are you selling your unique Pearl Cove gems ? He looked at the radiant black gem , but it had no answers for him except the one he already knew-seven years ago , his half brother , Len McGarry , had mixed the undercover life with one too many shady deals . It had nearly killed him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three people on earth who knew that Len had discovered the secret of how to culture extraordinary black pearls from Australia 's South Sea oysters . But Len had refused to sell even one of the thousands upon thousands of black gems Pearl Cove must have produced in seven years . Yet here was one of those gems : beautiful black ghost of the past . Part of a sign that something had gone right , not wrong . Maybe Len was finally healing in his mind , if not his body . Maybe he was beginning to understand that no matter how many glorious South Sea pearls he hoarded , he was still the same man . Linked with the thought of Len came unwelcome memories of Hannah McGarry , Len 's once innocent , always alluring wife . Alluring to Archer , at least . Too much so . He had seen her only twice in ten years . He could recall each moment with brutal clarity . She was like the black pearl , unique . And like the pearl , she had n't the least idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had showed up with her broken , bleeding husband in his arms and told her she had two minutes to pack , she did n't faint or argue . She simply grabbed blankets , medicine , and her purse . It had taken less than ninety seconds . Their flight out of hell had taken a lot longer . He was bleeding over the controls of the small plane he flew and seeing double from the concussion he got fighting his way through to Len . Hannah had n't said a word the whole time . She sat in the copilot seat and mopped blood out of his eyes , ignoring the blood that welled from her lower lip where she had bitten through skin to keep from screaming her own fear . Automatically Archer shoved Hannah McGarry from his mind . He was n't the kind to yearn for what he would never have . Hannah was married . For Archer , marriagefamilywas one of the few things left in the modern world that had meaning . Old-fashioned of him , even mulish , but there it was . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even unfashionable throwbacks . " So you do n't think this is a Tahitian pearl ? " Archer asked almost idly . " What makes you say that ? " " You 're asking questions in Seattle , not Tahiti . Either you ran into a dead end there , or you already know where the pearl came from and want to know if I know , too . " Teddy sighed . " If I knew where it came from and how to get more , I would n't be wasting time talking to you . I 'm here because I 'm tired of banging my head into walls . As for Tahiti , none of the suppliers and farmers I 've talked with admit to seeing this pearl or one like it before . Ever . And it 's not the type of gem a man would forget . " Unique , fascinating , never the same twice . Like Hannah McGarry . The thought came and went from Archer 's mind with the quickness of the colors sliding just beneath the surface of Teddy 's amazing black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Archer said , surprising both of them . " What 'll you give me ? " " Not as much as you want . You ca n't match the pearl 's color , so the usual kinds of jewelry wo n't work . Maybe one of my sistersFaith , most likelycould design an interesting setting for it as a brooch or a pendant , but then the artistry and workmanship rather than the pearl would become the true value . I 'd be paying Faith , not you . " Teddy did n't argue the point . Though cultured by man , pearls were n't mechanically produced : it still took an oyster to make a pearl . Being a natural , organic product , relatively few pearls matched well enough to be combined in jewelry . Lining up pearls for a necklace was like lining up a thousand redheads to match nineteen . Once you got past the superficial similarity , the differences came screaming through . " It could be a ring , " Teddy said after a moment . " It could , but not many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centerpiece could be ruined by a careless motion of a woman 's hand . Or a man 's . " The Hawaiian grumbled . " Your pearl is big , " Archer continued , " but not nearly big enough to interest high-end collectors or museums . They already have black pearls twice that size . Round black pearls . " " But the luster , " Teddy protested . " And have you ever seen a pearl with half the color ? It 's like a black opal ! " Archer had seen one pearl that put Teddy 's in the shade , but all he said was , " Yes , the orient is lovely . To someone who collects unusual pearls- " " Like you , " Teddy cut in. " this one would be worth perhaps three thousand American . " " Three ? Try twenty ! " " You try it . I would n't pay more than five . " " Bad joke . It 's worth at least fifteen and you know it . " Archer looked at his watch . He had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close her little shop in Pioneer Square . Though it did n't look like much from the outside , his sister 's store carried a multimillion-dollar inventory of international gems and one-of-a-kind jewelry . Normally one of the guards from Donovan International escorted Faith and her stock to and from the Donovan vaults . Today it was Archer 's job . In the past her useless live-in boyfriend , Tony , had guarded her , but to the great relief of the Donovans , Faith recently had rubbed the fairy dust out of her eyes and dumped him . " What else do you have to show me ? " Archer asked . Teddy looked at the tall American , measured the steely green of his eyes , and put the pearl back into its small velvet box with a sigh . " I keep hoping for a free lunch . " Archer smiled . " It 's part of your charm , Teddy . That and your relative honesty . " " Relative ! " he yelped . " Relative to what ? " " If I knew the answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The short , thickset man frowned . It was n't the first time he had n't been able to follow the other man 's baroque mental twists . " Hungry ? " Archer asked.s Teddy smacked his stomach with a broad palm . Though hefty , his belly was more muscle than flab . " I 'm always hungry . " " Bring your case to the kitchen . I 'll scrape up a sandwich for you . While you eat , I 'll look over the rest of the goods . " " Thanks . " " No problem . I 'll take lunch off the price of whatever I buy . If I buy . " Laughing , Teddy followed Archer through the living room into the condo 's large , lemon-yellow kitchen . A view of Seattle 's muscular waterfront filled the corner windows of the room . Out in Elliot Bay , huge container ships from all over the Pacific Rim waited at anchor for their turn to be unloaded by cranes that crouched like immense orange insects along the docks . Ferries churned among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a brisk southeast wind , low clouds trailed veils of rain over the dark gray water . " Nice view , " Teddy said . " But do n't you get tired of the rain ? " " Think of it as a moat protecting the city . " Teddy blinked , opened his mouth , and closed it again . Then he shook his head and laughed . Archer waited until Teddy was wedged into the breakfast alcove with a beer in one hand and a thick cheese sandwich in the other before he angled the conversation back to the pearl dealer 's recent travels . Because somewhere along the way , Teddy had found one of Len 's black beauties . " Did Sam Chang have any special pearls to sell ? " Archer asked . Teddy made a muffled sound , swallowed , and said , " That son of a bitch . Owns two thirds of the Tahitian pearl farms and acts like he 's selling off his first son at every harvest . Prices the goods like it , too . " " Golden Rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the local microbrews . " He has the gold , he makes the rules . " " Japan is going to bust his ass . He 's crowding their sales monopoly too hard . Great cheesewhat is it ? " " Gorgonzola with pesto . What about the smaller pearl farmers ? " Eyebrows raised , Teddy looked at the sandwich . " Nothing 's changed . They still line up like milk cows . " " Surprising . Aussies are even more contrary than Americans . " " Oh , there are some holdouts , " Teddy said , waving the ragged remnant of his sandwich . " But they 're being squeezed down to the bone by the consortium . Their shelling licenses are being cut , they 're not given the results of the latest government research until long after their competitors have it , their pearls end up in the doggy lots at the auctions . That sort of thing . " " Who 's their leader ? " Archer asked , though he knew very well . Just as he knew more than Teddy did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom in the international pearl trade . But a man who stopped asking questions never learned anything new . " Len McGarry , " Teddy said , downing the last bite of his sandwich . " I got ta tell you , that is one mean bastard . Whatever put him in that wheelchair might have cut off his balls , but it did n't soften him up one bit . " For an instant Archer saw again the terrible image of Len covered in blood , broken , lying utterly motionless in the aisle of the small plane . The memory was one that could still awaken Archer from a deep sleep , covered in sweat and hearing whimpers of pain echoing in the silence . Some of the sounds were his own . " Rumor is that he 's sitting on at least five years worth of the best pearls , " Teddy said . " His own , some other farms , and maybe a few of the Tahitian farmers on the sly . " Archer had heard about that , too . He believed at least part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cove 's balance sheets had been sinking like a stone in still water . Either the oysters had stopped producing pearls reliably or Len was holding out . As half owner , Archer should have cared . He did n't . Whatever Len squeezed out of the ruins of his dreams was fine with his silent partner . Money was the least of Archer 's problems with his half brother . " You always hear rumors about under-the-table alliances among pearl farmers , " Archer said . " Sometimes they 're true . " " Sometimes . " He opened Teddy 's case and gave the contents a quick , comprehensive glance . No more Pearl Cove gems . But he would n't let Teddy go away empty-handed . The Hawaiian was too good a source of gossip . Even outright **28;126;TOOLONG processed-could be as revealing as a sworn version of the truth . In any event , Archer planned on buying that black rainbow pearl . He just did n't plan on making Teddy rich in the process . " You 've been busy , " Archer said . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pearl-trading soul . He smiled and leaned forward over the table . " So , what do you see that you like ? " " That orange pearl . The one from a Vietnamese conch . " Teddy looked surprised , then laughed ruefully . " Damn . I was hoping to stump you on that one , too . " " Too ? " " Like the black pearl . " Archer looked at the pearl , night-dark , yet brooding in all the colors of the rainbow . " Nothing is like that pearl . " It was the type of gem men killed for .
