Government Headnote Corruption , mismanagement exemplify " new " Europe 's challenges . // Hungary is a country of 10 million mostly frustrated and pessimistic people , who no longer believe that the post-communism transformation begun in 1990 has brought genuine change . They are equally skeptical about the possibilities of any positive developments from Hungary 's membership in the European Union . These feelings are fostered by their everyday experiences . A general sentiment is that the system change only means that those who once had been devoted followers of Karl Marx have transformed themselves into neoliberal capitalists and kept all the capital for themselves . In Hungary 's transformation to capitalism , changes have been imposed on the people , who pay the price in job losses , high unemployment , lack of opportunities to live a decent life , poverty , and a growing gap between the new rich and the many poor . Hungarians are very cynical about the argument that , in spite of all the problems , they at least have democracy and a functioning market economy . The average citizen feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been managed . Hungarians who dare to voice opinions different from those of the " rulers " are still silenced , threatened , or economically ruined . The majority of the media speaks with one voice , which is the voice of the government leaders . No questions are allowed to be asked . Hungary 's election into the European Union is a typical example . Those who opposed or merely questioned Hungary 's proposed membership were excluded from the campaign , silenced ; they received neither money nor media time to express their doubts . This should have been a warning sign about the status of democracy in Hungary . The result of the referendum was that actually fewer than 40% of the potential voters were in favor ; the others rejected EU membership or simply did not vote . Corruption vs . Democracy Corruption is alive and growing . Hungary ranked just 33rd on Transparency International 's 2002 Corruption Perception index , tied with Malaysia and Trinidad and Tobago . ( Finland was " least corrupt " ; Bangladesh placed at the bottom of the list . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , Kuwait , Estonia , Bahrain , Oman , and Botswana are considered less corrupt than Hungary is . Corruption and democracy do not go hand in hand , and corruption is a poor vehicle for developing a functioning market economy .

Economic development in Hungary comes largely from foreign-based corporations that offer few " knowledge work " opportunities , says economist Magdolna Csath . To succeed in the new Europe , Hungary needs to invest more public funds in high-tech R &D,; she advises . // The economy in Hungary has shifted from a few large socialist enterprises subsidized by the government at the expense of the population to a few huge global companies subsidized by the government at the expense of the population . These subsidies include tax holidays , cheap ( sometimes free ) land offered to foreign businesses , and wages that are kept low so new enterprises can be established in a low-cost location . Companies also typically force the government to devalue the national currency by arguing that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency has never made an economy more competitive ; rather , it only helps exporters make more money . About 80% of Hungary 's exports are produced by a few large foreign companies . Hungary can not be described as a functioning market economy when the big players receive significant subsidies while the rest get none . This distorted market situation is unfair and uncompetitive. // " New " Europeans : What They Earn // Another defect of Hungary 's " new " economy is that foreign investment is largely in low value-added " screwdriver " operations-plants requiring diligent , disciplined line workers rather than creative , original thinkers . More than half of Hungary 's working population works in these screwdriver operations and have no opportunity to become independent entrepreneurs and new-idea creators . This is one major reason why the knowledge base of the society is rapidly deteriorating . Hungary has relatively few young graduates in science and engineering compared with the rest of the European Union . But without high-quality professionals in science and engineering , no country can become a leader in innovation , nor can it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of being a member of the so-called " first economy " countries , as promised by EU membership , Hungary will become a follower or , even worse , slide down to the periphery of economic development . Meanwhile , just 3.3% of Hungarians aged 25-64 participate in any type of education or training , compared with nearly 19% for Finland . ( The EU average is 8.4% . ) This lack of investment in continuing , lifelong learning and training bodes for a very poor future for Hungary unless there are drastic changes in government policies very soon , such as increased investment in R &D; to develop new industries-and jobs-in medium-and high-tech manufacturing . After Accession At the beginning of Hungary 's transformation in 1990 , MIT economist Lester Thurow wrote enthusiastically that Hungary would be in the best position to catch up with the developed world if it would base its development strategy on the knowledge and entrepreneurial spirit of its people and efficiently use the nation 's strong educational and R &D; institutions to develop competitive products and services . Instead , Hungarian politicians have chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially low-waged workers , and to attract as much foreign direct investment as possible by offering a very favorable business environment , including many different types of subsidies to them . In Hungary , many people believe that EU leaders know very well what is happening in Hungary and do not care . This indifference strengthens Hungarians ' suspicions that they are only wanted or needed for their markets , geographic location , cheap labor , reasonably clean environment , and land . So Hungarians have become increasingly resentful about EU membership . In addition , citizens painfully feel the squeeze of new taxes to pay for Hungary 's required contributions to the EU budget . The people also believe that Hungary will be a net contributor , because the country is not prepared to draw on the EU resources that will open up for the new member states . The biggest sin the government committed against the people was to impose a 25% value-added tax ( VAT ) on non-accredited training and education activities . This will tremendously increase the costs of further education and training , including language training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government decision was a typical sign of short-term thinking and a lack of vision and strategy . Similarly , the increase of VAT on solar-energy collectors ( from 12% to 25% ) punished those people who would like to use alternative energy sources . Hungary in the European Community There are tremendous uncertainties about what will happen in Hungary and other new member states after accession to the European Union . If the EU can not or will not handle current and emerging problems , it will definitely be unable to achieve the ambitious goal to become the world 's most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy by 2010 . Instead , it may actually slide further behind the United States in innovation , competitiveness , and economic growth . To improve the chances of achieving its goals for 2010 , the EU should strongly encourage its new members , including Hungary , to : * Invest more in R &D; and education . * Correct the distortions of the economic environment . * Develop real market economies by securing the conditions for fair competition . * Create an environment supportive of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the governance system . * Seriously decrease corruption . // Europe and the United States // * Develop a vision and a strategy for handling uncertainties and capitalizing on opportunities of enlargement . These strategies could help new member states avoid drastic economic , social , and political shocks hitherto unknown in the recent history of the European Union . Such shocks would render the new Europe decidedly weaker than its economic competitors and undermine its longterm goals .
