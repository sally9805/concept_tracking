Ghost Hill Theater , Denver , Colorado <p> Late August , Night <p> Jikata was taking her last bow on stage and soaking in applause when her great-grandmother died . The odd thing was that Jikata actually felt Ishi Yamuri pass away in one of those increasing moments of hyperawareness . As if the old woman touched Jikata with her stubborn disapproval even as others yelled and clapped . <p> The bond with her great-grandmother vanished . Ishi had n't waited to see Jikata tomorrow , the date Ishi herself had insisted upon . <p> Jikata had added her old hometown of Denver to her touring schedule because she 'd sensed her great-grandmother 's time was near , though she had n't heard from the woman in years . <p> Suddenly the applause , the only thing that had satisfied Jikata for a long time , rang hollow and empty . Like the rest of her life . <p> Jikata lowered her head , closed her eyes against the lights made brighter by tears . Then she stepped back on the polished wooden stage and let the heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clapped louder , but she had no more to give . This final event  --  the reopening of a newly renovated small Victorian theater  --  was the last in her tour . Fitting . <p> Her career was skyrocketing . She neared the pinnacle of success for a pop singer , a female half-Japanese no less , and found herself alone and panting after the climb . <p> Her life was tanking . Fans adored her . No one loved her . No man , no good friend female or male , no child . As her great-grandmother would have said , her soul was withering from lack of nourishment . <p> Applause came from stage right and the philanthropist behind the renovation strode forward , beaming , accompanied by his wife . Jikata pasted a smile on her face , hoping that it might turn into the real thing since she usually enjoyed the company of Trenton Philbert III . He stopped clapping and held out a hand and she put hers in it . " Great job . Definitely the next star . I 'm looking forward to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and let it go . <p> The praise warmed her a little . " Thank you . " <p> " You did the inaugural event of the Ghost Hill Theater proud . Thanks again for agreeing to perform . We sold out . " He glanced around , the backstage was still shiny with cleanliness and held the faint scent of wood stain . " This place should be good for another hundred years . " <p> " It 's a lovely theater , " Jikata said . Now . She could remember when it had been a ruin . <p> He radiated satisfaction . Turning to his wife behind him , he said , " We have a gift for you . Darling ? " <p> Juliet Philbert stepped forward with a large fancy birdcage fashioned like the Taj Mahal . Jikata gritted her teethno , please , not a bird . Her great-grandmother had kept finches when Jikata had been younger . " I 'm sorry , " she said , " but I  --  " <p> Then the bird opened its beak and pure liquid notes warbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it were more than song , a communication . The bird did n't look like any she 'd seen before , either . All scarlet red , but with a fancy cockatoo comb of red , yellow and white . About the size of a cockatoo , also . It fixed a yellow eye on her and let loose another stream of notes . This time sounding a lot like the underlying melody of the last ballad she 'd sung . Jikata blinked . <p> " Her name is Chasonette , " Juliet said . " She 's a Lladranan cockatoo and has the most beautiful birdsong in the world . She 's quite rare , but I knew such a lady would be perfect for you . And Trent indulged me . " She thrust the cage at Jikata , so she took it . It was lighter than she 'd thought . <p> Juliet tucked her hand into Trenton 's elbow and he covered her fingers with his own , shaking his head as he looked down at his wife . " I always indulge you . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " People say I 'm going soft . " <p> Fast footsteps came from backstage and Juliet 's assistant , Linda , who appeared distressed , hurried to them . Jikata remembered , and the small moment of normality shattered . <p> " I 'm sorry . " Linda stopped , inhaled a breath that raised her thin chest . Looked at the Philberts , hesitated and said , " I 'm sorry . I have bad news . We should ah let 's go to your dressing room . " Linda pulled Jikata backstage , past the greenroom and into the star 's dressing room . The Philberts followed . <p> The small room was elegant in cream and white , but four people made it crowded . Jikata placed the birdcage on the dressing room table . Chasonette stepped nervously back and forth on her perch , then apparently caught sight of herself in the mirror and preened . <p> Linda led Jikata to the cream brocade Victorian fainting couch that took up most of one end wall . She figured she had to sit . The moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since both their palms were sweaty . <p> Linda grabbed a box of tissues from the dressing table and dropped it in her lap . " I got a call . Your great-grandmother has died , Jikata . " <p> " I was supposed to visit her tomorrow , " Jikata said , still shocked . <p> " Sorry , " repeated Linda . She was a young intern with the University of Southern California who 'd traveled with Jikata during the two-month tour . Though they 'd managed well enough , neither of them expected the job to transform into anything more . <p> " She was an old woman and had a good life . " Is n't that what Jikata was supposed to say ? " I want to be alone , " she choked out . <p> " Of course . We 'll take care of your crew and fans . " Juliet , patting Jikata on the shoulder , trilled her tongue . Chasonette perked up and warbled a low , soothing melody . " I 'm sure you do n't want to attend the opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It had completely gone from her mind . <p> " We 'll make sure your room in the hotel next door is booked for you through the next week . It 's been a gruelling tour for you , I know . You need rest . " <p> " Yes , I 'd planned a long break . " Rote answers seemed to work . Jikata did n't know what she felt exceptempty . Nothing new about that . <p> " You just go next door when you 're ready , " Juliet insisted . <p> " Fine . " <p> The bird continued to croon , soft background scales that tugged at Jikata , reminding her of the chants and chimes that had haunted her . She rubbed her temples . <p> Trenton squatted down , as if setting himself in her vision . " Jikata , if there 's anything we can do . " <p> She nodded . " You go on to the gala . You 're the star of that show . " <p> " All right , but if you need us here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched blindly as the Philberts left . They were the only people she felt she could call on in Denver , and they were acquaintances . All her old ties had withered . <p> " Um , Jikata ? " Linda said . <p> Oh . The girl had looked forward to the end of the tour and the big party to celebrate the renovation of the theater . With another nod , another blank gaze , Jikata said , " You go ahead . You do n't have to stay with me the next couple of days . Let 's call this the end of the internship . " <p> " I do n't know , if you need me . " But Linda sounded relieved . <p> Jikata was prepared . She went to her designer backpack and got the card  --  with bonus  --  from an inner pocket . Held it out . " Thanks for all your help . I 've already turned in my last report . You 're free to go . " <p> " Thanks ! " With a smile showing the job was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jikata sat and listened as the theater emptied , then dragged herself into the shower . Let the heat and steam flow over her as she prodded her feelings about her Japanese great-grandmother . Regret , as always , they had n't ever seen eye-to-eye . Her great-grandmother had refused to speak to her after she 'd legally changed her name to Jikata , had hated that she 'd become a pop singer . At eighteen , Jikata had left the dust of Denver for L.A. and prospered . <p> Well enough that she could buy whatever she wanted , keep her great-grandmother in style . Which , of course , Ishi had refused , liking the little house in east Denver she 'd bought a few years after leaving the internment camp in southeastern Colorado . Both of Jikata 's grandmothers had died before she was born . Both her grandfathers had been unknown , a bond between her parents who were killed in a car accident when she was fourteen . <p> Sad . Jikata felt it , mostly for the lost opportunity to reconcile , though she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now she was truly alone . No more family . <p> She wondered what to do . Knowing Ishi , all her affairs would have been arranged . Jikata was ambivalent about seeing the old house . At the end of a tour , she usually found the nearest bed and fell into it . But lately her sleep had been troubled by dreams that had her sweating and tangled in sheets when she woke . Or , worse , visions that were pure beauty she strove to put into words and sing . <p> Those songs always bombed . She did much better when she sang others ' melodies and lyrics , and that was a raw spot in her soul . <p> The pipes creaked and water cooled and she turned the shower off . At least the makeup and sweat of the last show , of the tour , was finally gone . <p> Wrapping herself in a large towel , she stepped into the dressing room . The mirror was foggy with steam so she opened the door , dressed quickly in jeans and a blue silk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order and swung one strap over her shoulder . <p> She turned to do a sweep of the room and froze . <p> The birdcage door was wide open . Jikata blinked  --  could the bird have unlatched it herself ? Apparently so . A very valuable , rare bird . <p> Her gaze trailed to the open door of the dressing room . Shit ! She looked wildly around the room , but it was small and a foot-long scarlet bird was not evident against the cream-and-gold background . <p> Dammit ! <p> She had n't seen or heard the wretched bird leave . No trilling of a goodbye song . No soft whoof of feathers . <p> Sliding her feet into ballet slippers , she opened the door wider , then heard a tinny chime . She glanced at the table where the chiming-ball necklace Juliet Philbert had given her when they 'd met had been . Pretty and shiny on a gold satin ribbon , it was gone , too . <p> Jikata grimaced . She was ambivalent about chimes . She 'd included them in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last one that had made it big . It was hitting the top of the charts now . The strange concoction of bells and chimes and an occasional gong tone . She 'd sung  --  chanted  --  a mishmash of words in English and Japanese and French and had layered her voice in the track again and again over four octaves . She barely had a full four-octave range and had worked hard on that track until each note was strong and perfect . <p> " Come to Me " was going platinum . <p> The tune was n't really her composition and that 's what bothered her . She 'd heard odd patterns of notes , of chimes , of chants , the occasional gong beat in her head over the past two years . It had started here in Denver , her hometown , two years ago February . A February as dreary as her life . Ishi had n't wanted to see her then , either . <p> She shook the thought away . Stop dithering ! Go hunt the bird . She stepped to the door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her name ? Cockatoos were supposed to be intelligent for birds , were n't they ? <p> Another chime . Faint . But her hearing was good and she was sure it came from the stage area . She hurried past the greenroom , angling toward stage left , which had more space than stage right . A bird would want more space to fly in , would n't it ? <p> Only a few dim bulbs were on and she moved through light and shadow . She pushed through the curtains to look into the house  --  even dimmer  --  and saw a flash of a red wing through the door to the lobby someone had propped open with a broom . <p> Damn ! <p> So she hopped from the stage and ran up the plush maroon aisle , through the door to the equally elaborate lobby . <p> Then she heard the wonderful song of a woman 's voice , with the slightest of quavers that made Jikata think the singer was old . An elder and perfect master of her craft . The wordless Song compelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the mistress of that voice had the range of Jikata 's own , a full four octaves , richer for years of use . <p> Other music lilted . Crystal singing bowls , chimes , and the jangle of Chasonette 's ball melded perfectly into the whole . <p> " Chasonette ? " she called . <p> Chasonette chirped . Jikata ran after her , misjudged the distance of the sound and went through the mirrored wall . <p> No ! <p> That could n't have happened . Could it ? <p> She stood in a gray mist . Wind whipped at her hair . There were no walls around her , just an echoing distance . Where was she ? Her toes curled in her shoes , felt solid ground through the thin soles of her slippers . Should n't it be new , plush carpet ? <p> She hesitated , but more chimes and the voice and the bowls and the sheer magnificence of the sound drew her . How often did a person hear this sort of concert ? Never . <p> There were cadences and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As if she'dheard through a mirror darkly . She chuckled , but she yearned . This , this was what she 'd been trying to achieve for the past year . If only <p> Another questioning chirp and Jikata realized she was humming her " Come to Me " hit . Light was ahead and walls looked cut from rock . That reassured her a little . Everyone knew there were tunnels under Denver . She 'd somehow made it into one of them . <p> Then the woman 's voice twisted the melody and the notes seemed to hit physical points inside Jikata . She literally felt her heart squeeze . So wonderful , and there was more , she heard the reverberation of the chant she 'd included in her own work . <p> Come to me . <p> The woman 's voice caressed her with a soothing cadence . Jikata blinked , she saw the woman , a tiny , aged , Asian woman standing in light that reflected off mist around her , giving her a glow . Chasonette perched on her shoulder , the ribbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The sound shivered over Jikata 's skin . She glimpsed people behind the woman , playing singing bowls . <p> Stranger and stranger , but not threatening . <p> Jikata hurried forward , met a thickness in the air like a membrane , surged through it . More wind . In a tunnel or dreaming . She could have fallen asleep on the Victorian fainting lounge in her dressing room after her shower . But she plunged ahead . Then she was with the woman , and Chason-ette hopped from the woman 's shoulder to Jikata 's , dug in her claws . Ouch , she felt that ! <p> " Welcome to Lladrana , " the older woman said in English . She gestured and cymbals clashed and chimes sounded and a shudder went through Jikata . <br> Continues ...
