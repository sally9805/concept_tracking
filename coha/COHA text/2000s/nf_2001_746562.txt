Section : LIFESTYLE HEALTH AND EXERCISE Consider a personal trainer for an individualized workout plan for success <p> Maybe it was that last physical exam , the one when the doctor said you were a prime candidate for a heart attack . Or maybe it was n't quite so dire . Perhaps you 've just discovered that a certain dress you bought last year does n't fit the way it used to . Or maybe you simply want to look and feel better . <p> Whatever the reason , you know you need to start exercising . But where are you going to find the time to do it right ? Consider personal training . It may be just what the doctor ordered . Something for Everyone <p> It used to be that personal training was only for the rich or for elite athletes . <p> But now , with the health and wellness benefits of exercise so firmly recognized , personal training has become a more accepted way for people of all fitness levels and budgets to get the most out of their workouts . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work out better or more on their own , " says trainer Lawrence Wayne , owner of the Fitness Companion personal training studio in Chicago . " Most people have a personal trainer because they feel that they ca n't get started or continue exercising by themselves . " <p> Personal training is appropriate for almost anyone interested in enjoying the benefits of exercise , but some may benefit from it more than others . <p> " Lawyers , in particular , are perfect candidates for personal training because they do n't exercise because of a lack of time , " says Martha Coopersmith , a personal trainer in New York City and founder of the Bodysmith Co. , which matches personal trainers with clients . Personal training makes people exercise , she says , " because you have to make an appointment and pay for it whether or not you show up . " <p> Personal training , she adds , not only forces people to exercise but also helps them get control of their body and achieve fitness goals . " From a client 's point of view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a motivator , a part-time psychologist and a part-time nutritionist . " <p> If you find the idea of personal training attractive , the array of choices these days of where you can do it may help cinch your decision to give it a try . <p> Years ago , personal trainers were found mostly in gyms helping Arnold Schwarzenegger-wannabes pump iron . Today most still work in health clubs , but many more are willing to come to your home or office with equipment in tow . <p> Others have private fitness studios where there is never a wait for the treadmill or barbells . <p> Where a person decides to train is a matter of preference , but it 's important to know the benefits and drawbacks of each location . Consider : <p>  --  Personal training in a health club is probably the least expensive because you are already paying dues , but you often have to contend with waits for equipment and the stares of fellow exercisers . <p>  --  Exercising at home or at work with a personal trainer can be the most convenient , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment and high hourly fees . <p>  --  Working out at a private studio may be pricey and less convenient , but it often is the most efficient way to exercise . <p> According to personal trainer David Patt , owner of Body &; Soul Fitness in Tarzana , Calif. , lawyers may benefit most from personal training done in a private studio , where they are likely to be the only client . His lawyer-clients often come rushing into his studio from a deposition or hearing and are highly stressed and need to calm down before they work out . <p> " When you come to a private studio , you have the ability to control the atmosphere during your workout , " Patt says . <p> " So you can slow things down , have some quiet time and get rid of stress . " Choose Wisely <p> While the location of the training is a matter of preference , finding the right personal trainer is a necessity . <p> " Choosing a personal trainer is like choosing a lawyer , " says Patt . " You do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You should interview several and make sure that they are certified . <p> " Do n't choose someone just because they have genetically large muscles , " he adds . <p> Fitness experts agree that the single most important qualification a personal trainer can have is certification from a credible organization . It not only guarantees a basic level of knowledge about exercise and fitness but also about safety . <p> Exercise specialist Diane Doster , owner of Wellbeyond Fitness and Wellness in Sedona , Ariz. , suggests that personal training clients take their research a step beyond just establishing the trainer 's credentials and learn what his or her particular certification means . <p> " In the fitness industry there is no licensure or standard of care like you have in other professions , so the customer needs to do some research , " Doster says . " Certification could just be taking a multiple-choice test , and the trainer might not understand such things as diabetes and how it affects a person . " <p> When choosing their personal trainer , clients also need to think carefully about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Some clients want someone who will entertain them and take their minds off exercise . Others want a serious trainer . But all clients want results and are entitled to them , " says Coopersmith . <p> " Personal training is personality-driven and that is what makes it work . You really have to match up client and trainer . Do you want a friend or not ? Do you want to be pushed or not ? " <p> Clients also need to think about the trainer 's focus . Some focus exclusively on fitness goals such as body fat , strength and weight loss . Others look at the whole person , which includes fitness , stress relief and nutrition . <p> " If your focus is health and quality of life , in addition to feeling better about yourself and your body , then it is better to get a trainer who looks at the whole person , " says Doster . <p> Credible personal trainers also should have references , CPR training and liability insurance . <p> A good personal trainer should design a fitness program based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while keeping in mind his or her exercise and fitness history , as well as any injuries or health problems . <p> " Most people , unless they are starting something new or training for a specific goal like a marathon , are just trying to maintain their current level of fitness , because they find that as they age it is harder to do that , " says Wayne , of Chicago 's Fitness Companion . And , he adds , it is incumbent upon the personal trainer to change the routines as the client 's fitness improves . <p> " Progression also is important , " he says . " So is reaching a plateau . The benefit of personal training is to keep you motivated and encouraged to do more than what you might do on your own . It 's the responsibility of the personal trainer to get you over any plateau . " Getting Specific <p> While most people hire persona trainers to help them exercise more efficiently and effectively , there is a growing trend in the field for specialty training for specific sports like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says that any personal trainer should be able to design fitness programs that can help improve a golf or tennis swing . " If people want to improve their golf game , a trainer can design a program that would work on upper body strength and hip flexibility . " <p> Serious competitors would be better served by a specialty trainer , however . One way to find that person is by contacting fitness and exercise organizations like the International Dance and Exercise Association or the American Council on Exercise . <p> Personal training can also be a good idea for the elderly and those with specific health issues . " You want someone who will not base your fitness program just on your biological age , " says Doster . " You want them to assess your overall age . For example , a 40-year-old with high blood pressure , who is overweight and who is sedentary may be older than a fit 70-year-old . " <p> No matter what kind of personal training you choose , it is important to make sure your goals are being met  --  particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depending on what part of the country you live in and where you choose to be trained , but expect to pay at least $35 per hour and as much as $150 per hour for a qualified and experienced trainer . Most trainers recommend weekly or bi-weekly sessions with a minimum commitment of six weeks . <p> The costs underscore why it is so important to find the right trainer . Says Doster , " You do n't want someone who just counts the number of repetitions you are doing . She or he needs to be accommodating and understand you . " Go Group Training <p> So you like the idea of personal training but still do n't know how committed you are ? There 's nothing like the pressure of an entire company working together to get you motivated . <p> The new teamworkcompany.com Web site offers workplaces a tool to help groups of employees make fundamental changes in their lives to improve health , fitness and well-being . <p> According to teamworkcompany.com President Jim Grube , the Web site encourages people to get healthy by addressing seven basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trainers interact with employees over the Web to keep users motivated . Certification Counts <p> Just about anyone can get certified as a personal trainer these days , so it 's important to know if your trainer 's certification is credible and what it means . <p> Check out the Web sites of the most reputable certifying organizations to learn what your trainer had to go through to be certified . <p> American Council on Exercise : www.acefitness.org <p> American College of Sports Medicine : www.acsm.org <p> International Dance and Exercise Association : www.ideafit.com <p> National Strength and Conditioning Association : www.nsca-lift.org <p> Ca n't seem to find a personal trainer near you ?
