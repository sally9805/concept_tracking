<p> NASHVILLE  --  The last time Nick Harper stepped on an NFL field he left with a Super Bowl trophy as a member of the Indianapolis Colts . <p> Having seen the across-the-board effort it takes to win the NFL 's ultimate prize , Harper , who signed with the Tennessee Titans this offseason , refuses to get caught up in the consternation that surrounds his new team . <p> Harper is expected to lead a group of cornerbacks trying to fill the position left vacant in Tennessee by the full-season suspension of Adam " Pacman " Jones , a Pro Bowl-potential defender who also was emerging as one of the NFL 's top kick returners . <p> Jones , the No.6 pick in the 2005 draft , is the marquee name among the three players sidelined so far by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell 's hard-line conduct policy . Jones , facing trials on felony charges in Georgia ( obstructing police ) and Las Vegas ( setting off a strip-club melee that led to a triple shooting ) , is eligible to have his NFL suspension reviewed after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitable comparisons to Jones when the Titans open training camp July27 . <p> " Pacman was n't in Indy last year , either , " Harper says . " And we got the job done . " <p> How well he and others do that job will go a long way in determining whether Tennessee can sustain the momentum established last season . The Titans began 0-5 but finished 8-8 as Vince Young took over at quarterback . <p> In addition to Harper , Titans general manager Mike Reinfeldt signed Kelly Herndon from the Seattle Seahawks and used the club 's No.1 pick ( 19th overall ) to draft safety Michael Griffin out of Texas . Griffin will be moved to corner . <p> Harper and Herndon both were undrafted and earned their way on to Super Bowl rosters . Titans safety Chris Hope , a Super Bowl winner with the Pittsburgh Steelers , likes the idea of playing alongside teammates who came into the league unheralded . <p> " We all came from being backups  --  myself , Nick Harper , Kelly Herndon , " Hope says . " None @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the bat . We know what it takes in this league , and we have an opportunity to teach the rest of our group how important it is to come out to practice and get better every day . " <p> Harper , 32 , lost his final collegiate season at Fort Valley ( Ga . ) State when an eligibility ruling was made too late for him to enter the NFL draft . He spent the 2000 season in the Canadian Football League with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and then worked his way on to the Indianapolis roster in 2001 . <p> Herndon , 30 , was undrafted out of Toledo , was released by the San Francisco 49ers and the New York Giants and then landed a spot on the Denver Broncos ' practice squad in 2001 . He played for Denver from 2002 to 2004 and made 22 starts for Seattle in 2005-06 . In 2005 , Herndon set a Super Bowl record with a 76-yard interception return against Pittsburgh . But he broke his left ankle in the season finale last year and was released in June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you 're getting , " Harper says . " You 're getting somebody who was n't handed the job , someone who knows how to work and is going to work . You tell me who I 'm supposed to guard , that 's all you have to do . ... I ai n't been in the league for seven years for nothing . " <p> A potential sleeper in the mix is Ryan Smith . The sixth-round pick was a cornerback for national champion Florida and led the Southeastern Conference in interceptions last season with eight . <p> Difficult to replace <p> Tennessee secondary coach Chuck Cecil readily concedes no one player is going to replace Jones , who led the NFL in punt return average ( 12.9 yards , three touchdowns ) and was considered one of the few bright spots on the league 's worst-ranked defense for yards allowed . <p> " One thing for sure is that it 's very , very hard if not impossible to replace a guy who is as good as Pacman , " Cecil says . " He 's a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixth pick of the draft . " <p> Jones is only 5-10 , but Cecil says , " I 'll match him up against any corner in the league . He 'll play against any receiver . He has no thoughts about that , no inhibitions . " <p> Jones essentially shut down the Dallas Cowboys ' 6-3 Terrell Owens in a game last season , and against the Jacksonville Jaguars he made a victory-preserving defense of an end-zone pass to 6-6 Matt Jones . <p> Each of Jones ' would-be replacements faces certain challenges . <p> *Harper knows he 'll have to make a few adjustments to his game to be successful in the Titans defense . Tennessee plays more man-to-man than Indianapolis . <p> " There are a few techniques we teach that are new to him , that he 's getting used to , " Cecil says . <p> " It 's really just fine-tuning . It should n't be hard for him to pick up . " <p> *Herndon was limited in minicamp workouts while recovering from his broken ankle . <p> " We 're being smart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a doubt " he will be 100% for the start of training camp . <p> *Tennessee is confident Griffin will make a smooth transition from safety to corner . <p> " He 's very , very aggressive , " Tennessee coach Jeff Fisher says . " He 's a sturdy player that tackles and brings impact on just about every tackle . He is extremely versatile , and he 's athletic . He 's got great foot speed , change of direction and hips . " <p> Cecil says the key area where Griffin must improve is getting lower when he backpedals . <p> " You can get away with that at safety , but you can not get away with that at corner , " Cecil says . " You have your weight over your heels , and you ca n't match the cut of the receiver . " <p> Special team effort <p> Last season , opponents often had difficulty matching Jones ' cuts on kick returns . Some of his biggest runbacks came on daring cross-field moves or after he gave up ground and then exploded forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jones by committee on special teams . <p> Third-year receiver Courtney Roby returned some kicks last season and probably will do so again . Second-year cornerback Cortland Finnegan also is expected to field some kicks . Fourth-round choice Chris Davis , a receiver , had additional appeal because he was a solid kick returner at Florida State . <p> Roby says he wo n't forsake his north-south return style for the sake of emulating Jones ' freestyle runbacks . <p> " I 've got that in me , but I 've been taught to just get positive yardage , " Roby says . <p> Davis is of a similar mind . <p> " I 'll do that if I have to , but I really do n't want to , " Davis says . " If something goes wrong , it 's all on you . " <p> That 's an apt philosophy on a team that is n't placing the burden of replacing Jones on any individual set of shoulders . <p> PHOTO , B/W , Ed Betz , AP PHOTO , B/W , Jason Parkhurst , US Presswire PHOTOS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B/W , Chuck Burton , AP
