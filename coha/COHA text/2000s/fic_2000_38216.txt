I DO N'T UNDERSTAND MY FATHER . He says our kind of town , which is rural , is the saving grace of America . The people here have what it takes to keep a small place feeling important , he says , and the government should keep its big nose out of things . However , in the tradition of his father and his father 's father , he refuses to vote Republican . Also in this tradition , he is a lawyer . He and his best friend , Little Roy , have this in common . Little Roy defends his family , and Dad defends criminals . They are both country lawyers , according to people in town , which means they value their personal lives more than their professional ones . Dad shops only in locally owned businesses . When we drive by a Wal-Mart or a Sam 's , he shields his eyes until we have passed the enormous parking lot . I 've seen a few letters addressed to Dad from WalMart , though , with reports for him-a stockholder . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas and Easter , but he sometimes sleeps in the pew . He has a mustache , and it twitches like a rabbit 's whiskers until I yank on it and he wakes up . He is a tall man with long legs that brush against the furniture when he walks through our house , Hush . He walks through quickly , his wide shoulders filling the hallway , his boots scuffing the walls when he rounds corners . When he leaves , the place is too quiet , and I tend to hide out in his and Mom 's bedroom until he comes back . <p> This is where I am when people start to arrive for dinner . From the bedroom door , I see Little Roy come in with a handful of cosmos seeds . His eyes are deep brown and kind . The ceiling fan lifts a piece of his prematurely white hair , buoying it above his round , freckled face . Little Roy always looks as if he has come straight from the links , tanned and dressed in bright Easter-egg colors . Tonight he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue and yellow patches . Sara stands next to him in a wispy pink number that hangs all the way to her ankles ; she 's concerned about the seeds in her husband 's palm . <p> Little Roy offers the seeds to Mother , waits for her reaction . She clasps both her hands around his and smiles her broadest , best smile . Little Roy knows this smile , and gets embarrassed . He withdraws his hand , saying , " Do you have a Ziploc for these ? Or did Michael forget to go to the store today ? " Mother and Sara laugh-Mother more loudly  --  and walk into the kitchen . Sara and Little Roy know that , unlike other mothers , mine refuses to go grocery shopping . She tells Dad when he complains that it 's his contribution to domestic bliss . <p> Mother tells Sara and Little Roy , " Michael has left again . I suppose he 'll be back shortly . " I press my forehead against the cool doorframe and watch the group walk into the open space where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows when Dad will leave . But when he does , she follows a ritual to bring about his return . For the second time tonight , she prepared for company : She took the roses out of the foyer and put them around the living room ; she froze the shrimp and the soup , and searched through her recipe books for a new menu ; she turned off all the lights and lit candles instead . She took off her red silk shirt and white pants , put on an orange blouse and a matching short skirt . Dad will pass by the house at any moment , and if he does n't see that something has happened since he left , he will not have a reason to park his car , open the door , and come back home . <p> " Have you changed your clothes yet ? " Sara asks Mother , knowing the ritual . <p> " Yes . We were going to have turtle soup . Now we 'll have meat loaf , " Mom says . She disappears from view and comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object , " says Little Roy . " Not only is Michael cheating you out of sanity , he has cheated me out of turtle soup . " He tilts his hands into the plastic bag and lets the seeds fall . Some fly out from his hands and bounce on the floor . Sara bends down underneath him and presses the wayward seeds with her index finger . <p> " Why do you stand for it ? " Sara asks . " Why not lock him out ? " <p> " I love him , " says Mother . " I would die if he ever felt unwelcome here . " She seals the bag and puts it on the bookshelf next to undelivered gifts , small garden tools , and a box of candles . She pauses there , inspecting the seeds . Her back is narrow and long . Her shirt is wet in the middle . <p> " Is your air conditioning not working , or is it me ? " asks Little Roy . <p> " It broke this afternoon , " Mom says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She leans on the bookshelf , her back to us still . <p> " Maybe Michael is crazy from the heat , " says Sara . " Has he ever left in winter ? " <p> " I do n't think he has , " says Mother . " Nor in autumn . " <p> " That 's it ! It must be the weatherl " says Little Roy . " The heat , rather . " <p> " Maybe so , " Mother says , but she knows as well as I that autumn in Louisiana is really summer with less green in the land , and our winters last only long enough to say " Mississippi . " <p> I hear a spirited voice singing about dancing . The stereo in the living room is so high-tech that the man the voice belongs to could be standing in there , tall and real , passionate about dancing and even more so about singing . There he goes , his chin at a forty-five-degree angle to the ecru ceiling , ooohing in osculatory motion , foot tapping to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit to mesmerize me . Sara and Little Roy hear him , too , and ask where they could buy the album . " That voice is like honeyl " says Sara . They walk into the living room , talking about music . I am reluctant to join the conversation . <p> I hear the front door creak , letting in the loud voices of our other guests . Pierre is here with his new wife , Sally , and his daughter , who lives with her mother in Kentucky . My brother 's best friend , Scott , arrives by himself . Mother will want help now . I walk to them , a little hungry , wondering where Dad is . <p> Pierre , Sally , Little Roy , and Sara kiss me on the cheek and smile and say how pretty I look in my dress . They ask questions : " Where have you been hiding ? Are you getting taller ? Will you help your mother plant the cosmos ? " They avoid comments about Dad altogether . Mother smiles at the interest they take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less upset . <p> My brother is at the bar , and Scott wanders over with his hands in his pockets . Talking in soft voices and laughing , they pour the drinks . My brother sends Scott to deliver them . He walks back and forth , balancing each glass in one palm , steadying the lip with his other hand . He remembers the cocktail napkins , and to serve the ladies first . Sara takes a sip of her vodka tonic and coughs violently . Gently she says to Scott , " I like mine with a touch more water . " The boys accommodate her right away . <p> I have been introduced to Pierre 's daughter , but I can not remember her name . She sits on the hearth , knees together , head down , like she is thinking hard about some world crisis . She does not smile even once as everybody tells stories , gossips , and carries on polite conversation . I feel a little envious of her , sitting there without concern for how uninterested she appears . I realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , everything will be fine . <p> " Hey , " I say to her . She sniffs and looks at me , then back at the floor . Mother jerks her head like she has heard someone call her name . <p> No one but me notices that with this movement she is entirely out of the conversation going on around her . She gets up , walks straight to the window and stares out . She breathes deeply , noisily even , and goes into the kitchen . Dad is back . <p> He comes in through the front door , unembarrassed , happy . " Hellos " he says . Our guests are unsure of themselves , and they hesitate before shaking his hand , kissing his cheek . <p> " Dad , " I say . <p> " What ? " His hair needs combing . <p> " The air conditioning broke , and Mother and I had to go into the attic to find our old fans . " <p> " Do they work ? " <p> " They 're all plugged in and going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these old things . " He rubs the back of my neck , then continues walking toward our friends . I am not sure he has heard me . <p> With Dad 's arrival , night finally comes . The rooms along the back of Hush take on smoky hues , and there is an urgency amongst us to talk , laugh , and eat . I smell the meat loaf baking in the oven . We go into the dining room , the men rolling up their sleeves , the women unbuttoning their top buttons and knotting their hair to keep it from their necks . <p> I sit on Sara 's right and to the left of Pierre 's unhappy daughter , who turns her back , slightly , to her stepmother . Across from us , Scott takes sip after sip of his wine , and Little Roy , my brother , and Pierre shift in their chairs , trying to find as much personal space as possible . Mother leaves the room one second after sitting down at her end of the table . I hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and latching hooks on screens to keep out mosquitoes . She comes back , her face glowing , and sits again with a sigh . <p> Dad tells us about his most recent excursion . " I have never noticed how many signs there are on the highways . Gospel Singing Jubilee , ' ' Alexandria National Cemetery , ' ' Frogmore Plantation , ' ' Grand Village of the Natchez Indians . " ' <p> " Natchezl " I say , because it 's two hours away . Mother looks at me without expression , but quickly , her blue eyes clear and bright . " When I was driving , " Dad continues , " I thought , I have no wit <p> nesses here , only my own firm knowledge of how things went . Even now , as I am telling you all that I saw these signs , you have no way of knowing whether or not I really did . It 's frustrating , to the point that I 'm not sure I even saw them . My point is , I saw this butterfly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> He pauses , and when we realize he really wants to know , we all nod our heads . I feel the steam from the food on my plate , and from Sara 's and the girl 's . <p> " Well , " he says , taking a sip of ice water , " good . Because this butterfly is never with another butterfly . It flies alone and is entirely brave . You see them on the highway , straight in front of your windshield , and you realize after passing three or four of them that it is impossible to tell whether they are flying , or helplessly trapped in the gusts of wind the previous car throws backwards . You see these creatures , and you ca n't help but feel some connection to them . " He stops to take a breath and bangs his fist on the table . " How can we ever tell whether we are acting for ourselves , or because of some mistake someone before us has made ? " <p> Pierre 's daughter looks as if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With every turn , the oscillating fan at her right catches her wide linen collar in its wind . Each time , she reaches with her right hand to push the collar off her cheek and back into place . Pierre becomes irritated with this routine and gets up to move the fan so that it blows the tall vase of elephant ears instead . <p> Little Roy is listening , but he rolls his eyes like he is about to faint . He looks at his napkin and back at us , at the napkin and back at us again . He takes it in both hands and bows his head into it , like he is hiding some sorrow , and with one long press of his fingertips he blots his forehead and reveals a face still shiny . With this , Little Roy has acknowledged a fact : It is too hot to act sensibly . One by one the guests wrap their napkins around their heads and remove them until , finally , Sara leaves hers permanently at her temples by tying it at the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Dad has n't stopped talking about his butterfly , and I hear what he is saying . He is saying that here we all are , going through the daily motions , and maybe most of the motions are meant not to please ourselves but to please others . He wants us to think about who we are pleasing in our lives , and decide whether those people are worth it . He feels caught in somebody else 's tailwind , that is for certain . Mother does n't look like she feels responsible for the speech . Except for being shocked , she has n't shown much emotion . The sun is gone , so this heat does n't seem real . Still , Dad does n't seem to notice our guests fanning and wiping their faces , drinking their water , closing and opening their eyes . Above us , the chandelier of kerosene lanterns holds eight wild flames . They make quick shadows on the ceiling . There has never been so much movement at a dinner party . Dad 's voice rises and falls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roy . I start to ask where they are going . But when people leave rooms , Mom said to me recently , they could be going to the bathroom , and that is not something a person likes to announce to a group . Why ? I asked . Why is that embarrassing ? She was impatient , I could tell , and the best answer she could come up with was that she would n't want anyone in the group to imagine her seated on the toilet . My mom is a prude that way . She does n't question , does n't object . If I lived elsewhere-the North , maybe-I would n't have to worry about questions so much . I am about to ask Dad why he leaves us , when the girl really does cry , and I ask her what the problem is . " I 'm hot , " she says . <p> So that she might stop crying , Pierre tries to make her laugh by taking off his shirt . " What ? Are you embarrassed of my physique ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his posture and fills his chest with air , beats it wildly . The girl runs out of the room . <p> Mother comes back with a full pitcher of water . She walks around to each of us , hurriedly reaching for our glasses and filling them as the ice melts . Little Roy comes back without his pants and casts a furtive look around the room , as if he has performed the ultimate coup . He wears green boxers that have been pressed with starch , and brown socks . I check to see who else has noticed , but everyone is too hot . He sits and shifts nervously in his seat , waiting for somebody , anybody , to say something nasty to him . He has the perfect rebuttal planned for whoever bites . It wo n't be me . <p> We eat , and I am feeling less and less grateful . The meat loaf lies in thick slices on our plates . Green beans with onions and bacon nudge the meat , and the juices swirl together underneath the food . The third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thin pieces of goat cheese with salad dressing sprinkled on top . Sometimes this happens when Dad leaves , this odd way of eating . I have wondered what I will be like when I am Mother 's age , whether I will fix dinner when something else is clearly on my mind . I hope I wo n't . I hope I will give myself the time to take care of my worries . But even with Dad coming back from who-knows-where and sitting there talking nonsense , I feel a kind of permanence in this night . The table is big enough , beautiful enough , to hold all of us here . It is heavy . The meat loaf is thick . The air is hot but smells sweet . I wonder if Mother feels it , too . <p> Pierre tells jokes that involve politicians , Cajuns , and animals . He fingers the nasturtiums in Mother 's centerpiece as he talks . Sally looks embarrassed , and after she sips her wine , she clutches the stem of her glass . The room is really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone talks louder , drinks more , and stops eating . Dad laughs one last time at Pierre , and for a moment the constant hum that filled the room from the beginning of the meal ends . We look at each other , no one staring at any one person for long , and I wonder who will speak next . Usually , Dad picks up the silence , but he has eased into his chair and rested his head . With him , Hush settles , too . The boards creak softly at their meeting places . The fans blow against the windows , and the glass responds with catty sounds . Pierre says , " Hush ! The house is earning her namel " " Why do you call it ' Hush ' ? " Sally asks Mother . <p> " Well , " Mother says . But she ca n't finish her sentence . <p> " No one knows , " Dad says . <p> " Shhh , " Pierre tells Sally . He picks up the greenery from the centerpiece . Pulling it away gently so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a circle . He twists the ends together and happily , with ease , puts it on his head . Shirtless , crowned with leaves , he rolls back his shoulders and raises his chin loftily . <p> Strangely , no one looks to Sally for a reaction , but to Dad , who unbuttons and removes his shirt , assuming the same arrogance in his posture . He picks a flower from the table and eats it petal by petal , not taking his eyes from Mother 's face . She straightens too , expressionlessly letting the sweat drip down the sides of her face and neck . She chooses a flower and swallows it whole . <p> Little Roy says , " My priest and I were talking , and he said an amazing thing . He said that marriage is the hardest , most worthwhile work in the world . The only thing that comes anywhere close to the difficulty of that life , he says , is living alone . " <p> Mother says , " Momma had affairs . Her best friend , Lorraine Dubose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of . He was a state senator . They were at Galatoire 's from late afternoon till nine or ten at night , and drank martinis all the while . Many different people joined them at their table because , you know , Momma was a beautiful woman . But this state senator had had as much to drink as she had , and when they left , Lorraine was the only one nearly sober enough to drive . So she went to get the car , and when she came back , Momma and the senator were gone . She drove around the block , and in an alley down the street she saw the two of them pressed up against a brick wall , necking . So Lorraine stopped her car in the middle of the street and walked over to where the alley started , not going down the alley but just to the start of it , and yelled , ' Susie ! Stop kissing the senator ! " ' Everybody laughs . <p> I have not heard this story before , and I can see by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dad starts to push himself up out of his chair , but Mother says , " For a time , Momma thought she might become a Catholic . " He sits down again , sighing heavily . <p> Mother continues , " So this man , Monsignor Leon , spent hours with her , teaching her all she needed to know . He would come to the house while I was at school and Dad was at work . I know because one day I found his hymnal on the piano instead of mine , with a small calendar tucked inside that listed Momma 's name next to certain times on certain days . I am thoroughly convinced that this priest scheduled her like this only because he was a creature of habit , because how could you forget when you were going to meet a beautiful woman like her ? Dad caught them , nevertheless . And I have always felt a little bit guilty , because for Christmas that year I was so mad at her that I wrapped lingerie and put it under the tree with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she opened it in front of all of us . " <p> " What did Grandpa do ? " asks my brother . <p> " Nothing , " Mother says . <p> " Was n't he mad ? " I ask . <p> " It 's hard to believe , baby , but sometimes these things do n't matter so much , " says Mother . <p> " That 's exactly itl " says Little Roy . " Marriage is the hardest work there is . Affairs , loneliness , what have you , it does n't have to destroy everything if the two people work at it . " <p> Dad throws his napkin on the table . " How would your mother feel if she knew you were telling all this ? " <p> Mother brings her hand to her face with something like clemency . She clutches at the air with her other hand and stares at Dad . <p> " Dessert ? " she asks the room . <p> Little Roy tried , I will say that , but has been unsuccessful in lifting this conversation into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for the first time tonight , I would much prefer to be with Pierre 's daughter . I excuse myself and leave the room without clearing any dishes . By the time I get to the back door , I hear laughter in the dining room . Somebody has saved it all . I do n't care who . <p> I find the girl lying in our back-porch hammock . Her feet look huge in her flat , white , pointy shoes . At first I think she is asleep , she is so still , but as I get closer I see that she shakes . " Are you OK ? " I ask . <p> She turns her head my way and , simply , she wails . I ca n't believe the amount of time she has been upset . I know what it is like to feel embarrassed , or betrayed , or out of control , but I have never cried for one hour straight . <p> " What is the matter with you ? " I ask her . <p> " Go away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but so honest , that I do not think for one minute of leaving her . <p> " Why do n't you tell Pierre you want to leave ? " <p> " He wo n't . Sally will make him stay . Or if she ca n't , then she 'll glare at me for making us leave . " <p> " So what ? " I ask . <p> " I ca n't stand to have her glare at me . " <p> " My mother glares at me sometimes , " I say . <p> " But you probably deserve it , " she says . <p> " Maybe you do , too , " I say . <p> She sits straight up and jumps out of the hammock . " I have done nothing wrong , and you are stupid , " she says . " Where was your dad ? Why was he late ? " <p> " I do n't know , " I say . <p> " I do . He 's just like my dad . You 're going to be just like me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . The hammock swings . <p> I want somebody . I do n't know who , but somebody different . The party is getting louder . They have turned up the music , and I hear them calling , " Dancing ! Dancing ! " I walk back through , smelling the smoke and flowers , and reach the dining room as Mother , the last , leaves her chair . She smiles at me . She is happier now , but she is not who I need . <p> Like a matador and bull , Sara and pantless Little Roy are shaking and teasing in the middle of the floor . Pierre and Sally , Mom , Dad , and my brother have formed a circle , making an arena for the fight . Sara waves Pierre 's shirt like a cape , and Little Roy points his index fingers like ears , bowing toward her and scraping the ground with his left foot . They turn and twist , following each other for a time while those in the arena holler , " Charge ! " " Hook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> My brother unbuttons his shirt and takes it off , twirling it above his head and whooping . Scott waves to me from the sofa and laughs , his eyes like slits . The way things are going is fine for all of them . They do n't know the girl has called me stupid , and I feel that I am . I would like to ask my parents what they would do , but the scene before me prevents me from gaining any guidance . <p> The arena dissolves , and couples form in its place . My brother sees me peeking from behind the door , pulls me into the room , and we are dancing . He likes to twirl his partner , and I am dizzy and confused , and want to feel better , but instead I cry . He does n't notice , and I run out to the backyard . I ca n't think why exactly the tears come , but they do , and there is no sense fighting them . <p> Someone turns the music even louder , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They let the screen door slam behind them and move from the patio toward the swimming pool . They throw long shadows across the water . Around they go to the beat of the music , which is so loud I ca n't hear myself think . Behind Pierre , the others pantomime a trumpet , a guitar , and a saxophone . Pierre dives in and emerges , boxer shorts in hand . Mom , Sally , Little Roy , and Sara jump in after him . Scott and my brother run past me , giggling , carrying a case of beer . Then Dad sees me and stops . <p> He walks to me . He rubs the back of my neck . This gesture is old , from the time when I remember him taller , stronger , happier . In the evenings he sat in a big chair in our living room . His crossed long legs were all I could see if I looked for him from the kitchen . They were enough . He could balance me on his top foot , holding my hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his knee . <p> I shrug him off and ask him questions . They come pouring out , and he holds me tighter until , again , all I am doing is crying . <p> " Here we are , though , " he says . " Is n't that enough ? Look around . You , my baby , have roots . " <p> Little Roy removes his underwear , his shirt , and his socks . Quickly but without shame he runs laps around the pool , as if his very life depended on it . <p> " If they 're not enough for you , they 're not enough for me , " I say . <p> " Well , " he says , " you have a point . " <p> " What do you mean ? " I ask . <p> " I mean these are your roots , not your whole life . " <p> " So what 's my whole life ? " <p> " That 's up to you , " he says . <p> " Are you going to leave us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation now . " <p> " You should n't be here at all , " I say . Mom raises her arms above her head , and I think she is calling to me , but instead she jumps into the air and dives . <p> I let what I have said settle . I look at Dad for a sign he is listening . He looks at the sky . <p> " What do you do when you leave ? " I ask . <p> " I drive . " <p> " What else ? " <p> " I try to remember things . If I think really hard , I can remember when I was your age . Every time I walked out of the house , I had a new idea , and I 'd make it happen-just like that . I 'd go swimming at Spring Creek . Or the circus would be in town , and I 'd buy a ticket for the whole day . Maybe I 'd grab a pole and go fishing . When I drive , I can remember things like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . " " Take me with you sometimes , " I say . <p> " I ca n't , " he says . <p> " Why not ? " <p> " You 're too young to understand . " <p> " No , I 'm not . " " Yes , you are , " he says . " But you 're tough , too . You 're tougher than I am . " <p> " No , I 'm not , " I say . I turn and walk toward the house . <p> " Laura ! " he yells . I turn to look at him . <p> " What ? " We stare at each other for a moment , and I wait . He is a tall man and very thin . The way he holds himself now causes his bare shoulders to hunch over . <p> " You 're tough , " he says . <p> " Laura ! " Mother yells . " The water 's finel " She seems glad to be in the cool water , diving into it , swimming in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl hiding inside Hush , crying her eyes out . I open the red screen door and catch it before it swings back too noisily . The blue kitchen walls hide scuffs and marks from our years of comings and goings . There is just the candlelight from the dining room , touching the white kitchen floor in a slant . Maybe she is there , so I look around the table , the empty chairs , the scattered nasturtiums , Pierre 's crown . She is not in the living room , where some of the swimmers have left their clothes on the floor . The stereo is still playing , rattling the walls , and even though I am sad , I ca n't help shaking my head a little to the thumping music , closing my eyes . The hallway is so dark that I put my hands on the wall to find my way . Maybe she is in my parents ' room , but I open the door and see everything there in the moonlight untouched . " Hello ? " I say . Nothing moves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk to my bedroom . I know she is there . She would not go to my brother 's ; she would go to mine . I look on my bed , in my closet , in my bathroom , behind the shower curtain , and then I stop . She is nowhere . I ca n't believe she has gone . <p> From the bathroom I see that the attic door stands open in the hallway . Before the party , Mother and I walked up and down the steep staircase carrying the fans . Some of them were the upright kind . Most were little , but old , and heavy as lead . We had to move boxes and bags , out of the way to get to them . Then we had to wipe away cobwebs and dust . The electrical cords were long and had become tangled so that lifting one fan made the others wobble . All together there , in the corner of the attic under the skylight , they looked indestructible , like flowers of the future . <p> I get a flashlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I navigate squares of insulation and old things and pull the string that Dad has tied onto the light-bulb chain . Up here the heat is more intense , like a wall . I take long breaths , filling my lungs with air but mostly with heat . It is even worse than the dining room with all its steaming food and lanterns . <p> I point the flashlight at each corner , looking for the girl , and then I feel a breeze on my back , between my shoulders . I turn and follow it because it is a breeze , and nothing like it has visited Hush all day and night . On the floor in the space where the fans used to be is the plastic cover for the skylight , broken in two . I kick the pieces aside . The girl has moved a stepladder underneath the opening . I set the flashlight on the floor and climb . I am tall enough that my head emerges above the roof . Shingles stretch out on all sides . I turn around slowly on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either . <p> If I think really hard , I can see whatever I want , just like Dad used to do . I see Mom . Taking me with her to the park , up and down sidewalks downtown , in and out of the grocery and the mall , she carefully places one foot in front of the other . She holds her head high above her protruding belly , looking to others like a confident , happy woman . She is . And she is teaching me to be the same . Her left arm swings at her side , and her right is bent at the elbow so her straw sack wo n't fall to the ground . A school bus passes , and Mom imagines me on it , sees my head bouncing in rhythm with the big bus and the other kids on board . But they are hazy , and I am bright . I am the focus of her attention . <p> I see the levee , the barrier for our town . Grassy slopes run into piles of rocks that border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snores and rolls around in its bed like a body that ca n't get comfortable . On the town side , the rooftops of the bus station , city hall , and the museum connect like steppingstones . Tall bank buildings and the facades of department stores stand out against the night sky . One or two cars wait in parking spaces . Streetlamps give the concrete an orange glow . It 's nice on the levee , nice even in the dark water , where fish swim confidently , not knowing their supper from a baited hook , not knowing . <p> I see something else , too . I see the red earth turn brown , green , hard , and soft . It is lush . There it is , a place a girl like me stands on , and I know that if left alone to its work , the lushness will consume everything . The vines will turn gray to green ; the trees will make fists around symmetrical nonsense we have built , forcing their limbs into closed places like fingers in a bowling ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and white . <p> I feel a breeze , the second of the evening , this time on the left side of my face . I turn in its direction , but the girl is not there . Then I feel it again , on the back of my head . I turn and search the roof . I yell , " Where are you ? " She does n't answer . <p> I pull myself onto the roof and walk down the level , center part . " Listen ! " I say . " We do n't understand them ! We ca n't ! " I look down from left to right . I yell , " Where are you ? " I try not to sound mean . She must be here . <p> That man 's voice , the one from earlier that sang in our living room , reaches me again , this time all the way down the hall , up the attic steps , and over the roof . " Dancel " he says . So I do . I shake my head from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wave them like a crazy person and spin around . I close my eyes and sing with him . When I open them , she is there . <p> I did not hear her come , so I do n't know where she has been hiding . She laughs at me and covers her eyes , but I can see she does n't close them . Little pieces of the skylight stick to her long , dark hair . Her shirt has a tear in the shoulder , and her skin is broken underneath . <p> " What , did you break it with your head ? " I ask . <p> " No , " she says . " Just pushed on it till it gave . It fell on me . " <p> I hold out my hands to her , still shaking to the beat . She walks over carefully , her thin arms out for balance . We hold hands and kick our legs . We twist down until we are squatting , then jump up in the air . We kick again , twist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance on a roof . She laughs , now . Her moves are just like mine . <p>
