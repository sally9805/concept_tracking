The Spirit of Mozart // The British playwright Enid Bagnold once asked a feminist what advice she would give to a twenty-three-year-old housewife who , having lost four children , found herself pregnant again by an abusive , alcoholic husband . // " I would urge her to terminate the pregnancy , " the feminist replied . // " Then , " said Ms. Bagnold , " you would have aborted Beethoven . " // She was not quite right in her facts . Only two of those dead infants preceded little Ludwig  --  one of them the child of a previous marriage  --  and there is no evidence of Johann van Beethoven ever laying violent hands on his wife . But he was certainly a cruel father , and his alcoholism is a matter of court record in Bonn . So is his chronic lack of money , even though Johann was both a salaried singer on the staff of the Elector of Cologne and the son and heir of Kapellmeister Ludwig van Beethoven , a prosperous , retired master of music whose six-room apartment in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Magdalena van Beethoven gave birth to two more sons who survived : Caspar Carl and Nikolaus Johann . She then produced another son and two daughters , all of whom soon died . Her final confinement left her depressed and frail , doomed to expire herself , at forty , of consumption . Slender , earnest-eyed , moralistic , genteel , she floats like a faded watercolor sketch in the van Beethoven family scrapbook , amid more robust images of men of high color and stocky build . If they look more Dutch than Deutsche , these bourgeois Beethovens , if they signed themselves van rather than von , suggestive of noble ancestry in the Low Countries ( outside the Flemish medieval village of Betouwe ) , they were , by the mid-eighteenth century , established around Bonn , administrative capital of the Cologne electorate  --  German in culture , Roman Catholic in religion , Rhinelanders in their fondness for the grape . // Ludwig was born in town , at 515 Bonngasse , on or about December 16 , 1770 . The date is not definite . However , Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the font within twenty-four hours , and on December 17 his baptism was registered at the church of St. Remigius . The entry , written in Latin , identifies him as " Ludovicus "  --  a solemnization of his name that he came to like in later life , after learning about the grandeur that was Rome . Nor , in view of la gloire de la France , did he ever mind being called " Louis . " // He also took pleasure in the fact that old Ludwig sponsored his baptism . This made him the godson as well as the grandson of Bonn 's most eminent musician . The same dark eyes that looked down on him in the font were to watch again , oil-painted but still lively , when he lay on his deathbed . // Kapellmeister van Beethoven was everything Johann was not : popular , successful , secure at court ( he had served the Elector for forty-two years ) , a conductor of operas and masses , a shrewd businessman . He even sang better than his son , preserving a magnificent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in his position , he was not a composer . He died on Christmas Eve 1773 , just in time to imprint himself on young Ludwig 's dawning memory . Near and far , the old man would always float in an ambiguous sfumato , his expression kind , his turban cap pushed back . Was the vision primary or just a rearward projection of that oil painting ? // The question is pertinent , and not just because Beethoven insisted that his memories of old Ludwig were " vivid . " He also bizarrely believed that he had been born two years later than the register stated . Even when presented with an official transcript of the entry , courtesy of the mayor of Bonn , he rejected its " 1770 " and scrawled on the back , " 1772 . " Friends were unable to shake his fixation . He told them , " There was a brother born before me , who was also named Ludwig . . . but who died . " // In this , he was not altogether deluded . His parents had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name  --  in April 1769 . Transferring the name of a dead child to the next born was common practice in Germany . Dates were never Beethoven 's strong point , and his father further confused him , by lopping a year off his correct age when advertising him as a child prodigy . Still , a moment 's reflection should have made the mature composer realize that being born in " 1772 " and having " vivid " memories of a grandfather who died one year later made no cognitive sense . // His indulgence of this paradox has been catnip to Freudians . They surmise that Beethoven did not want to look at any certificate legitimizing him , in order to enjoy a rumor that he was the bastard son of Frederick the Great . The story  --  widely circulated in his life-time  --  was ridiculous . In 1772 , Frederick 's main squeeze was Poland , not an obscure housewife in Bonn . But Beethoven never issued a public denial . He rather basked in the supposition that royal blood flowed in his veins. // What has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another chapter . Suffice to say here that , while he might have preferred some other father than Johann van Beethoven , he always identified with the old Kapellmeister ( " my excellent grandfather , whom I so resemble " ) , long after the name of Ludwig van Beethoven had obliterated the name of Ludwig van Beethoven . // The Bonn of his boyhood was a small , walled , black-and-white city , fifteen miles upriver from Cologne . Its peculiar chiaroscuro came from black lava streets and almost universal lime wash . Even the immense electoral palace was white , dazzling in summer but frigid looking in winter . A gilded town hall added some glitter to the market square , but elsewhere plain plaster gables predominated . One of the few buildings to escape the brush was the old stone M ? nster . For five centuries , its prodigious steeple had cast a wavering reflection across the Rhine , resisting the river 's silvery slide . Older still were the Roman ruins around town .
