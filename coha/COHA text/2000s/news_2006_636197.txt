<p> FICTION <p> WHEN MADELINE WAS YOUNG <p> By Jane Hamilton <p> Doubleday , 274 pages , $22.95 . <p> Rubber boots are lined up next to the front door . An old dining room table , rolled on its side , leans against the house on the porch where newborn kittens paw at each other . Jane Hamilton opens her door , grabbing her face . <p> " Oh my God ! I was n't ready yet ! " she mumbles through a mouthful of banana . She wears khaki shorts , a T-shirt and hiking boots . Her hair , brown with gray streaks , is pulled back into a loose ponytail . A yoga devotee , she is thin with chiseled cheeks . <p> " We live in filth and squalor here , " she says , throwing up her ropey arms and inviting me into her kitchen where she is crushing garden tomatoes through a grinder . The pulp will make spaghetti sauce for dinner . <p> Many readers need no introduction to Jane Hamilton , the author of five novels  --  the latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bookstores this week . Hamilton also will be reading at several Chicago area bookstores . Two of Hamilton 's books , The Book of Ruth and The Map of the World , were Oprah Book Club picks . Map also was made into a movie , starring Sigourney Weaver . So when Hamilton 's book jacket describes her as a woman who " lives , works and writes in an orchard farmhouse in Wisconsin , " I wondered how much of that was hyperbole . After all , how could a writer so precise and convincing  --  her prose so beautiful , at times , that her passages read like poetry  --  be distracted by the sweat labor of farming ? <p> But standing in her 1860 farmhouse and walking the grounds of her 200-acre farm in Rochester , about 90 miles northwest of Chicago , it is clear that Hamilton is as much a part of the farm as the purple clover that colors the path around the farm 's hundreds of apple trees . <p> A native of Oak Park , Hamilton , as a child , attended farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wife . When she became a teenager , Hamilton worked as a counselor at the camp . " It was the joy of my life , " she says . " I dreamed I was going to marry a farmer . " <p> Several years later her childhood ambition came true , though not in the way she 'd envisioned . She 'd come to the orchard farm in August 1979 to help with the apple harvests . A recent graduate of Carleton College in Northfield , Minn. , Jane had an English major and a crush on the cousin of Bob Willard , the man who is now her husband . <p> " I was going to stay a few days . That turned into weeks , then months , " she says . <p> And now years . Her husband , Bob , was 10 years her senior , but the long hours working close together picking 40 different varieties of apples fermented a love-interest . " If he was going to find a woman , she would have to come to him because he was n't hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She did go to New York to be a publisher 's slush pile reader  --  the person who first sorts through the unsolicited manuscripts  --  but she quickly returned to the farm . " At first we were celibate and then I moved into his boudoir , " she said laughing . " I guess that was sort of bawdy of me , huh ? " <p> She applied to graduate school but insists that no one would have her . " It was good for me , here . I read a lot , quietly worked on things . I was lucky . I had time and privacy to figure out the format . " <p> We walk through acres of orchards , where the trees are bent , their bark gnarled . Hamilton names off both the antique and common varieties they grow  --  Canadian Melba , Golden Delicious , Macintosh , Courtland , Macoun , Black Willow Twig , and the much-coveted Moonglow Pear  --  and stoops to pick up and dust off a fallen apple to eat . <p> We approach an old house that serves as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pen , goats and sheep bay . Bob waves from his tractor then climbs down and offers me his hand . He wears bib overalls and a hat that covers most of his ruddy brown hair . He strikes me as a better-looking version of Lyle Lovett , with kind eyes and a soft voice . The large wooly ram is being ornery today , and Bob is worried that he might bite me , he says . <p> Bob explains how they use the goats ' milk and sell goat and lamb meat and wool . On Sunday afternoons in the autumn , families mill around the farm , drinking cider , buying and eating apples , and feeding apple cores to the goats . It sounds so idyllic . <p> After Bob climbs back onto his tractor and drives away , Hamilton leans into me : " Do you see ? How could I have resisted him ? Besides , he laughed at all my jokes . " <p> I ask her if Howard , the farmer husband in The Map of the World , was based on Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and physical attributes . <p> " Well , I sort of think of it as I took a gene from myself , I took a gene from my husband and put them into different bodies , situations , and it blew up into something very much themselves . I 'm sure there are bits and pieces , the way all characters are bits of yourself and whoever else stumbles into the story of the moment . " <p> Of course , there are many aspects that Hamilton does n't share with Alice , the main character in The Map of the World . She does n't have a pond on the farm , she 's never had a toddler drown and her last visit to jail was to escort actress Sigourney Weaver , who plays Alice in the movie by the same title . Before filming , Sigourney visited Hamilton 's farm to get into character . <p> " She had never been to the Midwest before , " Hamilton said . " And we had a swarm of mosquitoes that summer and she was eaten alive . " <p> Sigourney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course it was research for the movie . In jail , Sigourney asked the guards to treat her as they would any prisoner . She was booked and put in a cell . Later she was left alone in a visiting room , where she stared out with an unsettling gaze from the Plexiglas . <p> " She was in there for about 15 minutes and she really just became the character , you could just see her . That was kind of stunning . I had n't anticipated that she would be working at that level when she came to visit , " Hamilton remembers . <p> Hamilton shrugs off the glamor of having her book made into a major movie . Though the money was nice , she says , she 's not sure film is the best medium for her books . <p> She 's also unimpressed with celebrity . In 1990 , two years after The Book of Ruth was published , Hamilton received a call from Oprah 's producers who said that Oprah loved the book and they wanted to surprise their boss by inviting Hamilton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch the show , " Hamilton says . " I asked my publicist , ' Do I have to go ? ' Well , yes , you really do . " <p> The lunch was " pure pleasure " and the TV talk show host and the author talked " non-stop . " Though Hamilton was told Oprah did n't know she was coming , Oprah recited entire paragraphs from the book . <p> " I had never had that experience before or since , " Hamilton marvels . " Her gift is to make you feel like you are just the most loved person in the world and to feel that you will always be friends . She will always hold you in her thoughts . I certainly felt that at the time . " <p> Perhaps Oprah adored the book because it had striking similarities to The Color Purple , a book Hamilton had just read before writing Ruth . Hamilton admits she was trying to emulate Alice Walker in the book . <p> Regardless , the meeting would later prove fortuitous when Oprah five years later named The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next year , Oprah picked The Map of the World . <p> " She gave me a million readers , " Hamilton says fondly . " She certainly gave me my life as I know it now . " <p> That life is one filled with equal parts farm and books . With both son , Ben , 21 , and daughter Hannah , 19 , now in college , Hamilton does n't have to sneak in her writing like she used to . But she still clamors for stays at Ragdale , the writers ' retreat in Lake Forest , where Hamilton is a frequent guest and now serves on its board . <p> With little to do at night , Hamilton reads a book a week . Among her favorite authors are Henry James , Alice Walker , Jane Austen , Alice Munro , Louis Moore , John Updike and John Cheever . She does n't , however , enjoy going into bookstores with their dizzying displays . <p> " There are so many books and sometimes it 's just so overwhelming and when you read a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she says . " I think it 's just that you understand the limitations of narrative , you realize how rare real talent actually is . So you just want to read the few great books that you love and the few great writers there are and you do n't need to gobble everything . " <p> Done with our walk , we 're now sipping coffee at Hamilton 's wooden kitchen table with its mix-matched chairs , including metal folding chairs , the kind that proliferate in church basements . " I love being here , " she says . " When I go to New York and in Chicago , too , I have to go and see everything and it 's exhausting . I love going to bed at 9 . And there 's nothing to do here . " <p> Except on Wednesday nights when she goes to a friend 's house to watch " Project Runway , " the Bravo reality show about wannabe fashion designers . " It 's pure entertainment . It 's very high quality . It is the classiest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them buy fabric , " she says , defending her obsession . <p> She frequently drives to Chicago , mostly to see her mother , Ruth Hamilton , who now resides in an assisted living facility in Oak Park . After her mother raised her five children , she freelanced play reviews for the Chicago Daily News , Hamilton said . She describes her mother fondly as a poet and writer . Her late father was a former engineer for General Motors trains in La Grange . <p> It was on one of her Chicago trips that Hamilton saw Elizabeth Spencer 's " The Light in the Piazza , " the story of a mother who takes her mentally compromised daughter to Italy where she falls in love with an Italian . Because of the language difference , the young man does n't realize that the woman has a child 's mental ability . At first the mother tries to break up the couple but then realizes that this may be her daughter 's only chance at happiness . <p> After seeing the musical , Hamilton came home , read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story of a young wife who is brain-damaged by a bicycle accident but ends up being cared for by her former husband and his second wife , the young woman 's former nurse . Mac , the son from the second marriage who is raised to believe that Madeline is his sister , narrates the story . Only when his rough-mouth cousin suggests that Mac should try something sexual with Madeline does Mac learn that Madeline is n't even related to him . <p> Madeline is the second book in which Hamilton uses a boy narrator . She says she has grown to enjoy showing women through the eyes of male characters . " It 's interesting to look at our gender from the opposite perspective and to realize how difficult it must be to live with us . When I was in my 20s and 30s and I was with my women friends , we always felt so self-righteous that we were the right and true gender , there was no other way . As I get older , I have so much respect for men and what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family through decades , from the Vietnam War to the war in Iraq , and suggests that there are at least two ways of looking at the same events . <p> " I wanted to write a book that was about the way people talk about politics and how we talk about war , " she said . " If you 're the kind of person who believes in the goodness of people , then the way you tell the story is very different than if you 're the kind of person who believes in evil . That 's kind of true , in a gross generalization , between the liberals and conservatives right now . " <p> The book was a breakthrough for Hamilton in several ways . She was on book tour for her last book , Disobedience  --  a story narrated by a 17-year-old who discovers his mother is having an affair after he snoops into her e-mail  --  when on Sept. 11 , 2001 , Hamilton was stranded in Boston . The tragic events of that day ate at her psyche . It felt meaningless to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> But she plodded on and spent 3oe years writing a book that she eventually threw out . " I knew it was going to be dead on arrival , " she says . " The only thing I knew to do was to kind of keep writing it until it was the best failure I could make it . " <p> The book , titled Three Bad Women , was about a small-town librarian and an elderly woman who was a writer and a girl who was psychotic . " There was a little bit of adultery , a little bit of reading , there were a lot of library patrons . Oh , it was just the most dreadful , " she says cringing . <p> Hamilton had thrown out a book before Ruth and four distinct books she wrote while working on Map , but after four best sellers , she thought she was beyond writing a failure . <p> " Well , no , " she admits . " I think it would have been a bad book no matter what , but after 9/11 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that now should be told . " <p> The real test , though , came when she read the book to her husband , as she always does when she finishes a novel . " Every night , he was sinking further and further in the chair . I told him : ' You are mirroring what I know in myself . Thank you , you 've done your job , we 're done here . ' " <p> Hamilton is a strong advocate of reading work aloud . She even tapes herself on her iPod and plays while driving . But the most crucial readings are those that she gives her husband . <p> " It 's very intimate . It 's like he 's inside my brain . . . . There 's some alchemy that happens in his presence . I can tell a line is bad just by the way I say it because of his ear . He 's been very important to me . He also knows where everything comes from and he laughs in the right places and cries sometimes , which is extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different subjects  --  from physical abuse to adultery to loss to scandal to war  --  and are told from a variety of viewpoints  --  from a husband and wife to a 17-year-old boy to a gay man to a young uneducated country girl . But Hamilton insists they are the same book . " They 're all about triangles . . . . I used to worry about repeating myself but now I think , well , it 's all right as long as you keep trying to make it better . " <p> Jane Hamilton will be reading and signing at 7:30 p.m .
