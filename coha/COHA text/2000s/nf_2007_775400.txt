BUTLER BOOT CAMP // Housetraining the New Rich // Dawn Carmichael stands at attention , holding two plates of almond-crusted sea bass with Moroccan salsa . The blond , ex-Starbucks barista is dressed in a blue suit and white shirt , with a crisply folded napkin draped over her left arm . She ? s lined up with three other servers in the cavernous kitchen of the Starkey Mansion , a prim , Georgian home in downtown Denver . When they get the signal  --  two taps on the kitchen door  --  the group will march into the dining room , greet their 12 dinner guests and begin their first public performance of the Ballet of Service . // The Ballet of Service is a complex routine where all the waiters must serve the plates to guest in perfect sync . It takes hours of practice . And it is one of the most demanding skills taught here at the Starkey Mansion  --  better known as Butler Boot Camp . // Ms. Carmichael visualizes the routine : Serve to the left , take two steps to the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and serve again . When " addressing " the table , she must lean in far enough for a smooth plate delivery , but not so close as to make the guests uncomfortable . After serving , she ? s supposed to take one step back , wait for eye contact with the other servers and exit the room counterclockwise. // Each step must look like a choreographed dance , building to a climax called the " crossover "  --  a plate-juggling pas de deux in which the butlers slide the second plate from their right to left hand with a quick body pivot , creating the illusion that the plate is suspended in midair while it ? s being transferred . // The Ballet of Service is designed to show off all the desired traits of a butler-to-be  --  discipline , agility , poise and intimacy with tableware . And it ? s one of toughest training exercises here at Butler Boot Camp . // Four times a year , aspiring butlers from around the country converge for Boot Camp training at Starkey , officially known as the Starkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become masters at the care and feeding of the rich . For eight weeks , the students hole up inside the mansion to cook , clean , polish , dust , wash and fold . They learn how to iron a set of French cuffs in seconds flat . They ? re taught how to clip a 1926 Pardona cigar , how to dust a de Kooning canvas and how to pair an oaky chardonnay with roasted free-range game hen . // They learn how long it takes to clean a 45,000-square- foot mansion ( 20 to 30 hours depending on the art and antiques ) , where to find 1,020-thread-count sheets ( Kreiss . com ) and how to order Ben &amp; Jerry ? s Chunky Monkey ice cream at midnight if your employer is on a yacht in the Mediterranean ( a British concierge service ) . They will be able to divide a 30,000-square-foot home into " zones " for cleaning and maintenance . They will design " stationery wardrobes "  --  envelopes and letterhead specially designed to reflect the owner ? s wealth and social standing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stored in a cedar closet ( it dries them out ) , and that Bentleys should never , ever be run through the car wash . // Most of the students live in the mansion during Boot Camp , following the strict Starkey rules . Everyone has to wear a uniform of khakis , crisp white shirts , blue blazers and brown shoes . First names are banned ; everyone is " Mr. " or " Ms. " to stress the importance of boundaries . The students are required to rise from their seats every time a visitor enters the room . If there ? s a coffee cup that needs filling , a spoon that needs polishing or a visitor who needs welcoming , the Starkey students must spring into action . The butlers-to-be are so wired for service that when a class break is announced , they all pounce from their seats to fill each other ? s water glasses . // By the end of the course , the aspiring butlers will be masters at pampering the privileged . The rich , they will learn , like their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If their employers have four homes , chances are they ? ll want their dresser drawers and bathroom cabinets arranged exactly the same in every house , so they don ? t have to go searching for their socks or pills . And they learn that the rich live in constant fear of germs. // " They ? re health freaks , " says Raymond Champion , Starkey ? s chief instructor , standing at the whiteboard in Starkey ? s basement classroom . " These people are very successful and guess what , they want to live forever . These are very germ-oriented people . Get used to it . Germs are huge in this world . " // No butler leaves Starkey without learning about the two other priorities for the wealthy  --  pets and collections . At Starkey these are known as " BYJ " categories , as in Bet Your Job . // During one class , Champion tells a story of a Southern family that had an entire mansion filled with birdcalls , which the butler had to dust and maintain every day . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rich heiress who had a barn full of cats and employed three full-time litter changers and a full-time bird feeder to pour seeds around the barn to attract birds to entertain the cats . // " The guy who fed the birds got paid more than any of us , " he says . // Most of all , the Starkey students learn never to judge their employers , whom they call " principals . " If a princi- pal wants to feed her shih tzu braised beef tenderloin steaks every night , the butler should serve it up with a smile . If a principal is in Palm Beach and wants to send his jet to New York to pick up a Chateau LaTour from his South Hampton cellar , the butler makes it happen , no questions asked . // Starkey students pay more than $13,000 for Boot Camp . While that may sound steep , the payoff is even bigger . Butlering has become one of the fastest-growing jobs in the United States . With so many Richistanis needing so many butlers , demand and pay are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $120,000 a year  --  not to mention free room and board at the mansion . // First , they have to get through the Ballet . Tonight , Dawn Carmichael and the butlers are nervous . It ? s their first Ballet and they haven ? t had much practice . Dawn gets her signal and leads the other three servers into the dining room . Under a crystal chandelier , the dinner guests are arrayed at the table with perfectly spaced sets of flatware , finger bowls and assorted glasses . // The first plates go down smoothly . But on the crossover , Dawn moves before the other three servers . She freezes , trying to get back in sync . The other three also freeze . The guests glance up at the four panicked butlers standing motionless with their plates of sea bass . // Finally , the butlers nod , serve the plates and quickly march out of the room . // " I lost the rhythm , " Dawn says to the other butlers in the kitchen . " Oh man , was that bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Maine , is equally disappointed . " It felt awkward , " he said . " We looked like robots . " // The next morning , Raymond Champion takes the class to task . A former marine , whose specialties include martial arts , weapons training and decorative baking , Champion has little patience for sloppiness . He served as an enlisted aide to several generals and served in combat during the first Gulf War . With his six-foot-two frame , square jaw and impeccable manners , Champion makes for the perfect drill sergeant for Butler Boot Camp . // " I was disappointed , " he tells the students the next morning , standing in front of his whiteboard . " Very dis- appointed . " // Champion says that aside from the crossover , there were other foul-ups . He looks at John Leech , a flamboyant bed-and-breakfast owner from upstate New York . Leech was in charge of wine during the dinner and his job was to keep all the glasses exactly half full . Yet he allowed some glasses to drop to a quarter full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention to the guests ? conversation , rather than maintaining the detached attentiveness required of a butler . // " What can I say , I ? m a very social person , " Leech tells me later . " The guests were all telling interesting stories so it was hard not to listen . And I didn ? t keep the glasses full because I felt like I was being compulsive . But Champion was right . " // The next night the class hosts another formal dinner . It goes perfectly . Dawn leads an expertly choreographed Ballet of Service . Leech keeps the wineglasses exactly half full . And he successfully ignores the guests ? stories . // Champion greets them the next morning with a broad smile . // " Congratulations , " he says . " Now that was service . " //
