LARRY FITZGERALD is the product of special forces-physical and emotional , collegial and professional , individual and familial-that have shaped him into an NFL-ready receiver and polished person at age 20 Photograph // He is a lesson in complexity . he is a dual argument for heredity and environment . he is gloves and genetics and Dennis Green and the guys from the Minnesota Vikings . he is Minneapolis and Valley Forge Military Academy and the University of Pittsburgh . he is a refined product of the laboratory that was the Vikings ' practice field as a team ballboy. he is the rough edges of two deaths too close , last April and june , first his mother , then a teammate . Larry Fitzgerald is the compressed , pressurized , stone-cold , high first-round lock who emerged from this petri dish of ... well , what do you call all this ? There were physical , mental , visceral , emotional , collegial , professional and familial forces at work on a fellow who grew to a potent 6-3 , 218 pounds . The end result is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that NFL teams seem willing to overlook his youthfulness , his mere two years of college experience , his purported lack of sprinter 's speed and deem him well-enough prepared to become a top-five selection in next month 's draft . " You could see very early in his career that he had a chance to be special , just because of his catching abilities , " says Steelers director of football operations Kevin Colbert , who regularly witnessed Fitzgerald at Heinz Field , the stadium the University of Pittsburgh and the Steelers share on fall weekends . " The more you saw over that two-year period , especially this past season , at times he appeared-I do n't know if it 's a word-'undefensible . ' He just made spectacular plays . he did it so often , people realized it was n't a fluke . " " And I think his maturity will help him . he does n't come across as a young player . " Despite his meager age of 20 , given all that has moved and shaken him , amid a draft rife with controversy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every sense a prized catch . Pittsburgh so hates to lose him , a ballroom of 1,500 people thrice gave him a standing ovation February 21 , when he was honored as the city 's 2003 Sportsman of the Year , the youngest winner in the award 's 68-year history . In his acceptance speech , Fitzgerald announced to the university chancellor and the city as a whole that " a couple of years down the road , after I get my degree , I want to be on the board of trustees . " Not the average Saturday night aspirations of a college sophomore , huh ? Maybe that 's why this complex young man is considered so NFL ready . Larry Fitzgerald Sr. is the longtime sports editor of the Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder , a respected African American newspaper in the Twin Cities . he also is a longtime radio personality , who for years was the co-host of a weekly show with then-Vikings coach Dennis Green . One thing led to another , and his son went to work as a ballboy . His son Marcus , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the first step . Marcus told him what a blast it was and Larry followed , working his first Vikings training camp as a security guard . " He always seemed older than he was , " recalls Vikings equipment manager Dennis Ryan . " Shoot , he was 13 years old , but with his size and maturity , you were convinced he was 16 , 17 . " The next year , the kid who almost was too polite to everybody stepped on the field . And stayed . The lanky teen wore his trademark gloves throughout the workouts . he worked the juGS machine in practice , then worked out alone with it afterward " and pretty much showed some of those guys how to do it , " Ryan says . " There were some kids who were gone in the first wave of cuts who he could compete with-with his hands . Unbelievable , the way he could go after punts , then just so softly catch it and put it away . Honest to God , he did that better than any player here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tossed footballs and sprinted with Cris Carter and Moss after practices . He watched work habits . he learned receiving secrets . He absorbed behaviors . Along the way , Carter grew as close as an uncle , inviting Little Larry-as some in the Twin Cities still call him-to his speed camps and into his Florida home in the summer . " I think most talent is innate , " Colbert says . " But being around those guys , how they practice , how they adjust their routes , their body positioning , and how they catch the ball , it could have done nothing but help him . In the 20 years I 've done this , in my opinion , Cris Carter had the best hands I 've ever seen . To be around somebody like that , you just could n't help but learn . " " Habits get internalized , whether you 're at a playground watching kids or at a Vikings practice watching Cris Carter , " says former Pitt receivers coach J.D. Brookhart , now Akron 's head coach . " You 're picking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put that with talent , which he has , and it 's the right kind of combination . " High school games at the Academy of the Holy Angels brought out a stream of Vikings to study a kid who caught 73 passes for 1,254 yards and 17 touchdowns as a senior . " Why would n't you go watch him ? " Pitt coach Walt Harris says . " He 's such a great kid . " Midway through his senior year , Larry and Carol Fitzgerald decided that because of academic needs , their eldest son would attend prep school . They sent him to an eastern Pennsylvania outpost with a historical name , Valley Forge Military Academy . A year and a half later , in 2002 , he arrived at Pitt . History will record an inauspicious beginning at the school . Fitzgerald caught one pass for 11 yards in his opening game , against Ohio University , and the first fade thrown in his direction was batted away by a cornerback . That is believed to be the last fade-pattern pass deflected from Fitzgerald 's large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " Harris says of the route , " it brought his game back . he made great catches from then on . " Fitzgerald learned Harris " intricate passing game slowly . " I did n't know all the X 's and O 's , " he says . He contributed early as a freshman , catching 30 passes for 457 yards and three touchdowns in his first seven games . Then , buoyed by progress in the passing game and the return of the fade pattern , he went on a tear over the next 19 games : 131 catches for 2,220 yards and 31 touchdowns ( averages of 7 , 117 and 1.6 ) . he produced a touchdown reception in an NCAA-record 18 straight games . he led Division I-A with 1,595 yards receiving and 22 touchdowns in the 2003 regular season and walked away with the Biletnikoff Award , as the nation 's outstanding receiver ; the Walter Camp Award , as the Division I player of the year , and a second-place finish-the highest for a sophomore-in the Heisman Trophy balloting . " Valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carter , who keeps in regular phone contact with his surrogate nephew . " It did help to develop and build him . Being away , it helped him appreciate his family . And the family has been very , very close . I did n't add anything to it ; it 's the Fitzgerald family . What they 've done with him , that really is the fundamental thing . " Genetics can not be overstated here . Larry Fitzgerald Sr. was a Small College AIlAmerican lineman at Indiana State and had a tryout with the New York Giants . Carol Fitzgerald founded not one but two AIDS-related agencies in their community . The Fitzgerald family was selected the United Way 's family of the year in the Twin Cities in February 2003 . The father was a respected media type . The mother was a seven-year breast cancer survivor . Barely two months later , the insidious disease had invaded Carol 's lungs and brain . In the hospital , she asked Carter to watch after her boys . She died April 10 . She remains such a presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larrys and Marcus , that her voice still is on their home answering machine : " You 've reached the Fitzgeralds ... " Father and sons dial their own number just to hear her . " She was such a high-character individual and oh , so helpful to the community , " Brookhart says . " She put everyone ahead of herself . Very , very unselfish . And that carried over to Larry . " This was a woman who used to regularly call Tyler Palko , Pitt 's sophomore quarterback and Fitzgerald 's roommate , not only to check up on Larry but to allow Palko to " kick his butt " if necessary . This was a woman so close to her son that Larry returned to wearing his hair like hers , in braids . This was a woman to whom he dedicated this past season and the rest of his career , to whom he promised he would return to college and earn his degree . " I think about her all the time , " he says . " It 's hard for me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would my mom want ? " just try to achieve . just be a good person . " Two months after Carol 's death , Billy Gaines , a friend and receiver whom Fitzgerald helped recruit to Pitt , died tragically . After a controversial party , Gaines and a friend were in a crawl space in the ceiling of a church where Gaines was staying after his apartment had caught fire , and Gaines fell to his death . Nineteen-year-olds usually do n't deal with such tragedies . Certainly , not all at once . " There are a lot of things in life you ca n't control , " Fitzgerald says . " But it 's not your place to understand it . " Instead , he immersed himself in physical preparation . he spent day after day running , drilling , catching passes , watching film . And internalizing his grief . " Larry 's the type of guy , he does n't let many people in , " Palko says . " But he 's handled ( both tragedies ) just like anything else , within himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of class . " Do n't misunderstand ; Fitzgerald has n't grown into a morose young man . he still has moments when he teases people and clowns around , moments when he flashes the Fitzgerald charm . " He 's a polite , respectful young man , " Brookhart says . " Very humble and also , at the same time , very savvy in that he knows how to treat people the right way . That comes back to him , because people want to do things for him ; help him ; make him better . " It 's this maturity , this preparedness , this professionalism , that catches the NFL 's attention . It 's why Harris advised Fitzgerald to leave Pitt early for the draft . Perhaps it 's even why , without fuss or fanfare , NFL officials announced on the same day as the controversy-addled Clarett verdict that they had accepted Fitzgerald as being three years removed from high school and therefore rendered him eligible for the draft . " We place a strong emphasis on character , " the Steelers " Colbert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , generally humble and a team guy , you see those things on the field , but off as well . He 's probably mature beyond his years . " Carter thinks so . " This is a man who has a great deal of ability , and he is n't telling anyone about it , " he says . Take Fitzgerald 's humble response to scoring a touchdown . " He hands the ball to the official as if to say , " Put the ball back into play , because I 'm going to score again , ' " Carter says . Photograph Carter ( left ) admires his surrogate nephew 's ability and the fact he does n't flaunt it on the field . // Fitzgerald has been preparing for the draft in Lincoln , Neb. , under the direction of former Pitt and current Nebraska conditioning coach Dave Kennedy , who previously helped Ohio State 's Joey Galloway , David Boston , Shawn Springs and Nate Clements make themselves draft-ready . " I think he 's probably more prepared than any of those guys to deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dealt with his whole life , " Kennedy says . Physically , Fitzgerald already is the virtual NFL prototype . he has the size and strength to cause nightmares for most cornerbacks . His speed in the 40 , supposedly in the 4.55 range , is not elite , making his scheduled March 22 workout for NFL scouts hugely important-but he has everything else going for him . One NFL front office executive says Fitzgerald " wo n't run by you , but he feels the hole in a zone and knows how to shield defenders and adjust to the ball . And he has unbelievable hands . " Fitzgerald would n't be the prospect he is-the comparisons to Carter and other great wideouts keep pouring in-without his mental sharpness and maturity . " He comes up with very high marks in the maturity and attitude category , " says one NFL general manager . " He is a very respectful young man who has been raised in a good value system . " Says Kennedy , " Most guys just run routes and try to beat guys in 7-on-7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing things differently . he works on different things . Getting physically prepared is only one aspect of his entire game-and really who he is . " Who is Larry Fitzgerald ? The answer is complicated , same as this young man . he is one of the youngest players in the NFL draft pool yet more polished than most . One who easily received special permission to enter the draft as if it were a soft fade route . One who just might be the most rounded and grounded of the lot . Ready ? Is he ever . Sidebar Scouting the bigs The War Room breaks down Larry Fitzgerald 's skills in the five categories commonly used to evaluate wide receivers and offers scouting reports on the top wideouts in the draft who have the size to pose matchup problems for NFL cornerbacks . A rich class of big receivers became even stronger last week when Southern California 's Mike Williams announced he would enter the draft . The War Room grades prospects on a 1.0-9.0 scale . Players rated 8.0-9.0 are considered " franchise players ; " those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larry Fitzgerald ( 6-3,218 ) * Hands : Displays exceptional hand-eye coordination . Almost never drops a pass and often makes spectacular catches . Has an uncanny ability to adjust to poorly thrown passes over his shoulder . Is outstanding on jump balls . Has long arms and big , strong hands . Catches passes on the run without losing speed in transition . Shows the strength to make tough catches in traffic . Grade : 9.0 * Patterns : Is an impressive route runner . Knows how to create separation and get open . Shows good initial quickness off the line . Is smooth and fluid for a tall receiver . Knows how to set up man-to-man defenders . Rarely tips off his route . Bends knees and drops weight to make hard cuts without slowing down much . Lacks elite speed but is deceptively fast on downfield routes . Knows how to get open against zone coverage . Grade : 9.0 * Run after catch : Gets upfield quickly , shows some wiggle in the open field and is a big , strong runner . Mostly is a straight-line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets what is available . Makes subtle moves after the catch and is adept at cutting across the grain . Shows a second gear when getting a step on a defensive back but lacks explosive speed . Has a long stride and the great vision to find creases . Grade : 8.7 * Release : Shows good initial quickness for his size . Is difficult to jam because of intelligence , moves , size and quickness . Big cornerbacks might have success against Fitzgerald because he lacks the elite speed to burn them if they miss jams at the line . Most NFL corners , though , will struggle to jam him . Grade : 8.6 * Blocking : A big strength . Has terrific size and works hard . Gets downfield , finds his assignment and works to sustain blocks . Has long , strong arms . Grade : 9.0 * Bottom line : Fitzgerald lacks only elite speed . Otherwise , he is the perfect NFL receiver . he is a big target on short and intermediate routes and is a downfield threat because of his initial quickness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defensive backs . FINAL GRAOE : 8.9 Mike Williams , USC ( 6-5,230 ) Though Williams does n't have elite speed , he 's faster than Fitzgerald and is a more explosive vertical threat because of a better combination of size and speed . Williams is the best overall prospect in the draft . he should be a top five pick , and it would n't be a surprise if he were taken No. 1 overall . FINAL GRADE : 8.9 Photograph Roy Miiams Sidebar Roy Williams , Texas ( 6-23A , 208 ) After working hard in the weight room for the first time in his career last offseason , Williams avoided the hamstring injuries that bothered him in the past , and he looked sharper than ever . He 's a complete wide receiver , with excellent size , speed , hands and run-after-catch skills . FINAL GRADE : 8.7 Reggie Williams , Washington ( 6-4,220 ) Williams reaches top speed faster than most big receivers and shows excellent body control . he has the size and playmaking skills to develop into a No. 1 receiver in the NFL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6-3% , 185 ) Unlike elite receivers such as Randy Moss and Terrell Owens , clayton lacks the physical skills to dominate . However , he maximizes his potential and has a great natural feel for the game . FINAL GRADE : 8.4 Michael Jenkins , Ohio State ( 6-4,213 ) Jenkins is a durable , playmaking outside receiver who is at his best when working the sidelines . he should quickly develop into a solid No. 2 wideout in the NFL . FINAL GRADE : 7.9 Rashaun Woods , Oklahoma State ( 6-1 Ve , 194 ) His only real weakness is a lack of ideal speed . he is polished , tough and competitive but might never be more than a possession No. 2 receiver .

What kind of immediate impact can the team that drafts Fitzgerald expect ? Since 1990,18 receivers have been among the first 10 players taken , and the first-year success rate of those players varied widely .
