" The great melting-pot of America , the place where we are all made Americans of , is the public school , where men of every race , and of every origin , and of every station of life send their children , or ought to send their children , and where , being mixed together , they are all infused with the American spirit and developed into the American man and the American woman . " - WOODROW WILSON , 1913 // J.E.B. STUART HIGH SCHOOL opened in Falls Church , Virginia , in 1959 . At that time the school , named for a famous Confederate cavalry commander in the American Civil War , possessed a student body of 1,616  --  virtually all Anglo-American . Change came slowly , accelerating during the mid- 1990s , when immigration to the United States-legal and illegal-reached today 's near-record level of a million people a year . According to the 2000 census , 10 percent of America 's 281 million residents were born in other countries , the highest percentage since 1930 and the largest number in US. history . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. came from Europe , owing largely to quotas that favored northern Europeans . In 1965 Congress removed those quotas , and since then more than 60 percent of immigrants have come from Asia , Africa , the Caribbean , the Middle East , and Latin America . Says Kenneth Prewitt , former director of the U.S. Census Bureau , " We 're on our way to becoming the first country in history that is literally made up of every part of the world . " Immigration patterns worldwide show a flow of people from poor countries to those with stronger economies , especially to industrialized countries with aging workforces . The influx is changing the makeup of populations in Britain , now 7 percent foreign-born , and France , also 7 percent . Immigrants now constitute nearly 10 percent of Germany 's population , and 17 percent of residents in Canada are non-Canadian . In many ways J. E. B. Stuart mirrors this immigration revolution . Half of its 1,400 students were born in 70 countries . In " Combating Intolerance , " an elective course for juniors and seniors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crimes , Ku Klux Klan violence , and why " No Irish Need Apply " appeared on job posters in cities where Irish immigrants looked for work in the 19th century . The morning I sit in , one of the students remarks : " America is a country of immigrants but also a country that sometimes hates immigrants . " " So why would anyone want to immigrate to the U.S. ? " I ask , wondering if the students can reconcile this country 's ideals with its shortcomings . Hands go up . " It 's a country that gives people a chance to escape , " a boy from Eritrea says . " People have a natural right to life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness , " declares a girl from Nicaragua . More hands wave . " What makes America special is that things are more ' wishable , ' more likely to happen here , " says a boy from Vietnam . " It 's the tolerance , " adds one voice . And then another : " The best way for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day here . " Heads nod in agreement . They seem a little smug to me . " What 's it like in this school for kids who do n't speak English ? " I ask . The class on intolerance is silent . " Do you ever do anything with them ? " Someone in the back makes a comment , and the last row laughs . Students in this class reflect a wide range of colors and cultures , but all speak English fluently and with no accent . Earlier that morning I 'd eaten in the cafeteria and had heard many students who could not answer even simple questions from the people at the cash registers . In 1990 some 32 million U.S. residents spoke a language other than English at home , and more than 7 million lived in households with no fluent English speaker over 14 years old . When language data from the 2000 census become available next year , the number of households with little or no English is sure to be much larger . A basic command of English is a requirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a foundation for economic self-sufficiency . For the students who arrive at J. E. B. Stuart speaking no English , life can be tough . Two volunteers from " Combating Intolerance " escort me to a nearby corridor where English as a Second Language ( ESL ) is taught . " I never come here ; ' says one . He was born in Pakistan but learned English when he came to the U.S. at age ten . " Yeah adds the other boy , born in the U.S. but whose parents are Middle Eastern . " I have n't been here in years . " Ruth Dejong 's ESL class emphasizes experiential learning . Students color pictures of objects in books to show that they understand words she is using . They get up and stand next to the window when she says " window . " They write the new words and use them in sentences . As Dejong helps them pronounce words , her enthusiasm makes the students laugh . " Is anybody in here handsome ? " she asks . A student raises his hand . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome . " Dejong 's classroom is filled with teenagers , but the props make it look like a room for first or second graders . Stuffed animals lie on a sofa . Wall charts show pronouns , colors , parts of the human body . Everything- " window , " " blinds , " " pencil sharpener " - has a label . Among the books on the shelves are What the Dinosaurs Saw , Morris the Moose , and Who Sees You at the Zoo ? Along with them are dictionaries : Italian , Korean , Persian , Russian , Turkish , French , Hindi , Spanish , Portuguese , Vietnamese , Swahili , Serbo-Croatian . Dejong , who has taught ESL for 20 years , says , " About a fifth of the students now are nonliterate in their native language . That makes it much more difficult for them to learn English : ' A child 's age of arrival in the U.S. , she explains , is crucial . Young children have little difficulty with English , learning it in elementary school at the same time they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her class , who are beginning English and only starting to read at ages 14 to 17 , it is much harder . " Let 's do some reading now , " Dejong says , passing out a booklet written by local teachers . It contains reading and vocabulary lessons based on fictional students . " Many students are at school reads one student . " They are talking and laughing . They are not talking to Ali . He is sad and afraid . " Slowly and softly , Dejong calls on everyone , even those who never raise their hands . She is both gentle and persistent . If they do n't learn to speak and read English now , she knows , they wo n't stay in school-no matter how intelligent they are . ONE-FIFTH of the full-time jobs in the U.S. pay eight dollars an hour or less . Filling most of these jobs are the 40 percent of the workforce who have no education beyond high school . Similar figures characterize most industrialized countries . For immigrants with poor language skills and little money , entering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B. Stuart 's computer labs are furnished with up-to-date equipment . The teachers are patient , and students still struggling with English participate here along with everyone else , learning to use word-processing software and to cruise the Internet . I find Mel Riddile , the high school 's principal , standing in the hall outside one of the labs , greeting each passing student by name . " Maybe the key to success lies in computers , " I suggest . Riddile disagrees . " Computers are important , " he says , " but not as important as literacy . The kids have to be able to read or they ca n't even use computers , " Riddile continues . " Here we spell hope ' r-e-a-d ' We make them ' haves ' by teaching them to read . It 's no guarantee , but it 's essential . " Riddile shows me how reading programs permeate the school 's curriculum . Students who need extra help attend a reading laboratory , but even in science and mathematics a systematic effort is made to teach reading . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social stigma as they select the easiest books . Emphasizing that more than half of his students qualify for free or reduced-price meals in the cafeteria , Riddile describes efforts to keep them in school : 6 a.m. automated wake-up calls help , as do special counselors who speak foreign languages . But some still drop out , he says , because they either need to work or become too discouraged . Parents , unfamiliar with the inner workings of an American high school and sometimes illiterate in their own language , are ill-equipped to help their children succeed . " We 're the best hope these kids have , " says Riddile . In the end Riddile is upbeat . Students who attend Stuart enjoy a special advantage , he says . " Going to school here makes them better prepared for the world . They 're living in the workplace of the 21st century . " A visit to the counselors ' offices offers further perspective on the workplace of the 21st century . " Immigrants often do the work no one else wants to do " says one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and restaurant work . There is no shortage of such jobs in Fairfax County , Virginia , the jurisdiction that operates J. E. B. Stuart-where the median household income is $80,000 a year . " But students do n't want these types of jobs . Their parents do this kind of work out of necessity , but most of the students hope to do something more professional . " " How many go on to college ? " I ask . " About 59 percent of the student body as a whole goes on to four-year colleges and 21 percent to two-year schools , " another counselor replies . " But the numbers are much lower for foreign-born students . The big economic jump may be made by their children . Remember that many of the kids here have already passed through a great filter . They have a much better chance of making it than do lots who do n't get here . It 's relative . For them , to have a job and a home and enough money to feed a family can be a very big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not think of themselves as college material , " says Mark Rogers , coordinator of J. E. B. Stuart 's International Baccalaureate ( or IB , for short ) program , a rigorous precollege curriculum for juniors and seniors . The work required is significant : For every course , a student can count on at least one hour of homework every night . Some 250 students ( about 20 percent of the student body ) take at least one IB course , although the program is open to all upperclassmen . Most of the students in the IB classes I visited were nonimmigrant whites . Rogers says teachers try to recruit a broader range of students by persuading them to take special preparatory courses in the ninth and tenth grades . But the work is especially difficult for immigrant students because courses require fluency in English . One pattern is clear : The longer immigrant families have been in the U.S.-and the longer they have spoken English-the more likely their children are to take IB courses . They are following the same pattern that has characterized most assimilation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside , what about being a teenager at J. E. B. Stuart-an immigrant teenager or an American teenager in this small-scale melting pot ? A teenager with black skin or white skin , brown , yellow , or red skin-a teenager who speaks English or Spanish or Chinese or Hindi ? " I do n't want to be white , " says a white student from Poland . I 'm in the library with a cross section of students who volunteered to speak with me . Others agree with the Polish-born youth , but I 'm confused . They explain . To call someone " white " is an insult , as are synonymous terms like Wonder bread . " I do n't consider myself white , " says a young woman from Russia . She has white skin . " Whites act white and do white stuff . " " What 's white stuff ? ' I ask . " White kids act different . They hang out differently . Whites are privileged . They 're smart , do homework on time , run the student government , participate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are involved in the school . " " When you go to apply for a job , " says one boy , " you have to act white . " " What do you do on weekends ? " I ask . They all answer : Eat at a diner , talk , chill , watch television , go to an outlet mall , be with a boyfriend while he gets his car inspected , talk on the telephone , go to a movie . " Sounds like what a white person would do , " I say . Several students shake their heads , amazed at my inability to understand . Most white students remain silent during these discussions . " I wo n't apologize for being white , " says one . I end up wondering if these kids are n't just struggling with an age-old adolescent dilemma : wanting to achieve versus wanting to be " cool . " If achievement-or at least too much achievement-is unfashionable and achievement , as they have defined it , is " white , " then " white " is not cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not , the kids here know they 're in a blender : People of different colors and textures go in , and a mixture that appears homogeneous comes out . Everyone has a backpack . Most boys wear jeans and T-shirts ; many girls wear short skirts or tight pants , showing a bit of bare midriff . Boys and girls wear earrings and talk about the same music . But running beneath the sameness in fashion and attitude is a current of ethnic soula diversity that many of the students cling to even as they conform . They may sense that they are losing their family stories in the blender . Students here come from places where there 's war , civil unrest , or extreme poverty . Some have horrible memories ; a few have seen family killed . Most of them , though , have asked their parents very little about their decisions to immigrate . " My parents do n't talk much about it , " one explains . Another girl says , " I 'm Malaysian , but one set of my grandparents was from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The students ' ethnic awareness coupled with the sense of losing their ethnic identity creates a subtle tension , even in the relatively benign atmosphere of the high school . " Hey , Italian ! " evokes a response of " Hey , mulatto ! " Pakistani girls are teased about wearing pajamas to school . " I 'm forgetting Arabic , " says one student . " I can feel it fading away , being sucked away from me . " " It 's part of becoming an American , " says a friend . This pattern persists even in the Hispanic community , which now constitutes more than 12 percent of U.S. residents . Roughly half of second-generation Hispanics assimilate so completely that they do n't learn Spanish . " We feel better with our own people , " explains one student when I ask about apparently segregated groups in the cafeteria , which has a distinct geography that all the students can readily map out . Groups that sit together include Pakistani , Spanish-speakers , Moroccan , freshmen , cheerleaders , slackers , and nerds . Blacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the black Americans . Some tables are frequented by students who live in the same apartment building . Despite such boundaries , most tables appear just plain mixed . At what looks like a typical table I pass out a piece of paper and ask everyone to write down his or her ethnic background . The results : " half Greek , half Middle Eastern , " " Greek , " " Saudi Arabian , " " Bolivian , " " African American , " " Hispanic , " " white ( American ) ; " " Russian , " " African , ' " Pakistani , " " confused , " " mixed-black with ? ? " Lunch in the cafeteria seems dominated by interaction between two groups that transcend ethnic differences : boys and girls . Handholding , hugging , and occasional kissing have been very much in evidence throughout the school . Even some of the Muslim girls , who wear clothes that cover their entire bodies , have magazine pictures of muscular black men wearing only bikini briefs taped up inside their lockers . What do these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforce ? A Sikh student says he finally talked his father into letting him cut his hair . Some of the Muslim girls argue with their parents about what kinds of dresses they can wear . One girl says that her mother told her she would have to marry an Asian man , and another girl insists that people must marry for love . A third girl reports that her mother says that people marry people , not cultures . But most Stuart students are too young to be thinking of marriage . Conversations , especially among the boys , quickly turn to cars . " A car means freedom , " one says . " You can go anywhere-your car is your life . " A friend , who is saving his minimum-wage earnings for a car , says , " I know this girl farther out in Virginia I want to visit . With a car we could go to the shore or to New York . Does n't everyone want to get away ? " At 2:05 p.m. the school day ends , and a rush to buses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or friends . Music blares from radios , kids sit on the grass , shouting , laughing , and flirting . I go for ice cream with several boys , most from the football team . It 's a typical J. E. B. Stuart group : an African American , an Afghan Italian , a Cambodian , and a Palestinian . They 're talking about rap music when two girls walk in . One of the boys goes over to talk to them . When he returns , the others tease him . He defends himself : " I just asked if they 'd like to chill together sometime . " These are normal American teenagers , I think , wondering how I 'll get them to discuss immigration issues . Then I realize that they 've already taught me the most important lesson . Young people whose backgrounds span the spectrum of human cultures are becoming " normal American teenagers " and in the process they will change America . We may not know yet what the change will mean , but the kids themselves know they are at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply and confidently , told me : " We make America more interesting .
