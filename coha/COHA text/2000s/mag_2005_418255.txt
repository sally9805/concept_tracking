WALGREENS has racked up an amazing track record over the past 30 years . Now , as it confronts some scary new rivals , the drug chain is going to find out if it 's really built to last . // WALGREENS MAY BE THE GREATEST COMPANY you 've never met . Oh , sure , you 're aware of WaIgreens-with its 4,798 drugstores coast to coast serving four million customers a day , how could you not be ? But Walgreens is such a low-key company in such a mundane business-its executives hate being the subject of articles like this one ; its headquarters , in Deerfield , 111. , looks as if it was decorated roughly around the time of the Nixon administration-that it 's easy to miss the fact that this 104-year-old chain has racked up one of the most impressive track records in corporate America . Walgreens is the only FORTUNE 500 company other than Wal-Mart to have increased both sales and earnings every year for the past 30 years . Its share of the $221 billion prescription-drug market is 14% and growing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returns exceeded GE 's and Intel 's . The stock peaked in 2000 and sputtered for a couple of years , but WAG consistently outperformed the S &P; 500 , and at its current level of around $46 a share , it has surpassed its previous peak . " The really interesting thing , " says Jim Collins , the author and management guru , " is how something so dull could produce such extraordinarily exciting results . It 's almost an enigma . " Collins was impressed enough with Walgreens to make it one of the prime specimens in Good to Great , his 2001 bestseller that explored how undistinguished companies very occasionally morph into superstars . No wonder Wal-Mart CEO Lee Scott recently said that Walgreens " may be as good a competitor as we 've got . " But as they say with mutual funds , past performance is no guarantee of future results , and Walgreens happens to be in the middle of a vicious multifront battle . First , there 's Walgreens ' biggest traditional rival , CVS , which has been expanding rapidly-it recently acquired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Scarier still are the supermarkets and mass-merchandisers that have been moving emphatically into the pharmacy business . Wal-Mart , which already has 3,144 stores with pharmacies , is testing 24-hour pharmacies and offers eye exams in many stores . The most dangerous threat of all-and one to which , as we 'll see , Walgreens was late to respond-is the rise of low-cost mail-order prescriptions , which represents a profound shift in the way Americans buy their medicines . " They are getting it from all sides , " says Sandy Skrovan , vice president of Retail Forward , a consulting firm in Columbus . So it 's crunch time for Walgreens . And here 's the question : Does this company have another big run left in it ? BEFORE GETTING TOO DEEP INTO THAT question , it 's worth examining what got Walgreens so far in the first place . Collins 's account of Walgreens is a parable about steady execution . Drugstores are a commoditized , low-margin business , after all , where success is n't a matter of grand visions so much as figuring out all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important edge in the drugstore business is real estate . A new Walgreens store opens every 19 hours , and 450 are slated for this fiscal year alone . ( CEO David Bernauer believes the U.S. has room for 12,000 Walgreens . ) Those numbers are even more impressive when you consider that these are mostly stand-alone stores built from scratch , not acquired . ( CVS 's expansion has come mainly from acquisitions , most notably its purchase of all those Eckerds ; struggling Rite Aid opened all of seven last year . ) In real estate , of course , location matters . High-traffic areas are obviously better than low-traffic areas ; neighborhoods with plenty of senior citizens are prized too - the average 70-year-old takes 16 prescription medicines a year , double the number taken by a 50-year-old . ( That last fact explains why the bulk of Walgreens ' grand openings of late have been in the Sunbelt : multitudes of retirees . ) Judging by the longevity of its stores , Walgreens picks its spots well : Of the 3,600 new stores it has opened over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of poor sales . " We do n't make too many mistakes in real estate , " says Bernauer , in what for him is a wild display of braggadocio . Another edge is Walgreens ' constant push to drive down costs . According to John Heinbockel of Goldman Sachs , Walgreens has the lowest fulfillment costs in the industry , at $4.95 per prescription ; CVS spends $5.89 , and Wal-Mart $5.22 . Walgreens ' cost advantage means a lot when its average store handles 280 scrips a day . And between 1991-when the company began a $60 million program to overhaul its entire supply chain-and 2004 , Walgreens reduced its days of owned inventory from 68 to 41 , which translates into $2 billion worth of goods it no longer has to stock . THE PROBLEM FOR WALGREENS AND its ilk is that all the operational excellence in the world is useless if customers have no compelling reason to enter your store . Mail order is now the fastest-growing sales channel for prescription drugs . Last year drugs by mail grew 18% , to $33.9 billion , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prescription market-up from 11.8% in 2001 . Meanwhile , drug sales at chain stores grew only 6% . Mail order threatens not only the chains ' bread-and-butter prescription business ( which in Walgreens ' case makes up 63% of total sales ) but also the higher-margin , " front-end " general merchandise . That 's because customers who receive drugs in their mailbox are n't in their local drugstore shopping for cosmetics and candy . Although drugstores have hedged their bets with mail-order operations of their own ( see chart ) , the lion 's share of those sales is generated by pharmacy benefit managers ( PBMs ) like Medco Health Solutions and Caremark Rx . Highly automated and thus hugely profitable-they do n't have stores to build and staff-PBMs can fill and mail a prescription for as low as $2.50 , a fraction of what it costs drugstores , according to Bain &; Co. partner David Bellaire , an expert on pharmacy operations . Bellaire says those lower costs mean cheaper drugs for consumers , who also save themselves the shlep to the store to pick up their meds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 90day supplies of so-called maintenance medications-say , Lipitor for high cholesterol-through the mail only . Maintenance medications make up around 60% of the retail prescription-drug market ; " acute " medications , such as antibiotics , make up the rest . Benefits consultant Hewitt Associates found that 22% of employers either use such " mandatory mail-order plans " or are adopting them , vs. 16% who said so two years ago . Automakers like General Motors , burdened by enormous health-care costs , have been among the most enthusiastic adopters of mandatory mail . PBMs really started to take off about ten years ago , and for a time Walgreens grossly underestimated the threat . Indeed , there 's no mention of mandatory mail in Walgreens ' annual reports until 2004 . " We were wrong in not seeing mail order . We admit it , " says COO Jeff Rein . Walgreens certainly sees mandatory mail order now , and it 's fighting back . Calling those exclusionary deals between PBMs and employers the " Berlin Walls " of the drug-benefits industry , Walgreens wants to tear them down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies that insist their employees use mandatory mail order for maintenance drugs . For example , Walgreens will no longer fill any prescriptions - not even acute medications-for state employees in Ohio . CVS has pulled a similar move on Toyota . It appears that one company may have hit back : GM dropped WaIgreens from its pharmacy network on March 1 . Industry insiders speculate that GM 's move was a preemptive strike against Walgreens ' policy . ( GM says the move was not motivated by Walgreens ' policy ; Walgreens says the decision was influenced by GM 's PBM , Medco . Medco referred all questions to GM . ) You 'd think the safer strategy would be for Walgreens and its peers to entice customers rather than turning them away . And , indeed , they 're trying that too . Walgreens , CVS , and others have also started offering 90-day prescriptions in the store through their own PBM arms . Nothing kept drugstores from doing so previously ; nothing , that is , except their desire to see customers coming back for refills every month . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by more than 150 employers , including Southwest Airlines , and Bernauer claims it 's cheaper than mail - at least when measured against Walgreens ' own mail-order house . Advantage90 received a huge boost recently when Blue Cross &; Blue Shield of Minnesota decided to encourage its members to buy 90-day prescriptions for chronic medications at retail ; other states are likely to follow its lead . For now , at least , Bcrnauer can point to solid evidence that his stores and mail order can profitably , if not lovingly , co-exist . In fiscal 2004 , Walgreens ' prescription sales grew 17.8% , just about equaling the mailorder industry 's 18% increase . As babyboomers start to retire in droves , the U.S. prescription-drug market will grow even further , to more than $520 billion by 2014 . So Bernauer is betting that there will be more than enough drug pie to go around . But what about Wal-Mart and the other everyday-low-price bullies ? Bernauer admits that when it comes to shampoo , Crest , and other front-end goods , Walgreens wo n't win when customers shop purely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convenience-store argument-i.e. , that Walgreens ' stores are closer , easier to get in and out of , and less cluttered than the competition 's . Indeed , almost half of all Americans live within two miles of a Walgreens ( the density of its stores can reach Starbuckian levels-downtown San Francisco has 21 stores within a one-mile radius ) , and navigating a Wal-Mart Supercenter is no picnic . But both Wal-Mart and Target place their pharmacies close to the store entrance , and grocers often have separate entrances just for pharmacy shoppers . Still , Walgreens is able to draw shoppers largely because of the accessibility of its stores-most are drive-thrus , and the company has more 24-hour stores than all its competitors combined . Consumer-friendly touches seem to enhance the appeal . For example , Walgreens is the only retailer to have dedicated cosmetics salespeople in every store . Over the past two years the company has also been working hard to tailor individual stores to local tastes . In high-income areas , you 'll find a wide selection of pricey skin-care products like Neutrogena anti-aging creams and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in uptown Dallas , devotes more shelf space to Walgreens ' Rogaine knockoff , which is favored by his gay clientele . All that helps explain why Walgreens ' same-store sales , the key measure of retail performance , rose 10.9% last year and are up 9% so far this fiscal year , besting CVS ( up 8.2% , excluding Eckerd ) , Target ( 6.2% ) , Wal-Mart ( 2.8% ) , and Rite Aid ( down 0.9% ) . ONE FINAL POINT TO BEAR IN MIND IS that Walgreens has made it through upheavals before . The starkest example occurred 30 years ago . Back then , the company was known primarily as a dowdy operator of five-and-dimes with lunch counters and of a restaurant chain . ( A littleknown fact : Walgreens invented the malted milkshake . ) In the mid-1970s the company made the wise-and internally controversial-decision to get out of the food business and focus on being a drugstore . Jim Collins talks about the company as if it were a black belt in corporate rope-adope . " Every time you think their model is running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another level , " says Collins . " They do n't panic . They almost sucker you in . They want you to underestimate them . Then , bam ! They hit you so hard you do n't get up . " If Walgreens stays sharp on real estate , keeps its costs down , and does n't allow its fights with the PBMs-and their clients-to get too bloody , it just might survive the drug wars .
