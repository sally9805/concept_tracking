Chapter One December 2002-Brooklyn , New York The American Fiona Sweeney shoved a pair of rolled-up jeans into the corner of her purple duffel bag . Outside her bedroom window , a siren 's wail sliced through the white noise of a wet snowfall . Those eerie man-made moans were part of New York City 's wallpaper , a signal of trouble commonplace enough to pass unnoticed . But Fi registered this one , maybe because she knew she would n't be hearing sirens for a while . She turned her attention back to her bag , which still had space . What else should she take ? Lifting a framed snapshot , she examined her mother as a young woman , wading into a stream , wearing rubber boots and carrying a fishing pole . Fi cherished the photograph ; in real life , she 'd never known her mother to be that carefree . The mother Fi had known would n't want to go to Africa . In fact , she would n't want Fi to go . Fi put the picture facedown and scanned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irish poetry by her bedside . She tucked it in . " How about the netting ? " Chris called from the living room where he sat with Devi . " Already in , " Fi answered . " And repellent ? " asked Devi . " Yes , yes . " Fi waved her hand as though shooing away a gnat-a gesture that Chris and Devi could n't see from theother room . " Should have kept my mouth shut , " she murmured . Early on in her research about Kenya , she 'd discovered that the country 's annual death toll from malaria was in the tens of thousands . She had pills ; she had repellents ; logically , she knew she 'd be fine . Still , a figure that high jolted her . She became slightly obsessed and-here 's the rub-discussed it with Chris and Devi . Mbu-mosquito-had been the first Swahili word she 'd learned . Sometimes the insects even dive-bombed into her nightmares . Eventually , mosquitoes became a metaphor for everything she feared about this trip : all the stories she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jitters that come with the unknown . And what was n't unknown ? All she knew for sure , in fact , was why she was going . Fi 's mom had never been a big talker , but she 'd been a hero , raising four kids alone . Now it was Fi 's turn to do something worthwhile . " Fi . " Chris , at the door of the bedroom , waved in the air the paper on which he 'd written a list of all the items he thought she should bring and might forget . Money belt . Hat . Granola bars . " Have you been using this ? " he asked half-mockingly in the tone of a teacher . " I hate lists , " Fi said . He studied her a second . " OK , " he said . " Then , what do you say , take a break ? " " Yeah , c'm on , Fi . We do n't want to down all your wine by ourselves , " Devi called from the living room , where an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frizzy hair and securing it with a clip , Fi moved to the living room and plopped onto the floor across from Devi , who sprawled in a long skirt on the couch . Chris poured Fi a glass of cabernet and sat in the chair nearest her . If they reached out , the three of them could hold hands . Fi felt connected to them in many ways , but at the same time , she was already partly in another place and period . A soft light fell in from the window , dousing the room in a flattering glow and intensifying the sensation that everything around her was diaphanous , and that she herself was half here and half not . " You know , there 's lots of illiteracy in this country , " Devi said after a moment . " That 's why I 've been volunteering after work , " Fi said . " But there , it 's different . They 've never been exposed to libraries . Some have never held a book in their hands . " " Not to mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appealing to Fi , " Chris said to Devi , shaking his head . " Nai-robbery . " Though he spoke lightly , his words echoed those of Fi 's brother and two sisters-especially her brother . She was ready with a retort . " I 'll mainly be in Garissa , not Nairobi , " she said . " It 's no more dangerous there than New York City . Anyway , I want to take some risks-different risks . Break out of my rut . Do something meaningful . " Then she made her tone playful . " The idealistic Irish . What can you do ? " " Sometimes idealism imposes , " Chris said . " What if all they want is food and medicine ? " " You know what I think . Books are their future . A link to the modern world . " Fi grinned . " Besides , we want Huckleberry Finn to arrive before Sex in the City reruns , do n't we ? " Devi reached out to squeeze Fi 's shoulder . " Just be home by March . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take in her surroundings . She 'd considered subletting , which would have been the most economical decision , but she 'd gotten busy and let it slide . Now she noticed that Chris had stacked her magazines neatly and stored away the candles so they would n't collect dust . After she left for Kenya , Chris had told her , he 'd come back to wash any glasses or plates she 'd left out , make sure the post office was holding her mail , and take her plants back to his apartment . He 'd thought of that , not her . A nice gesture , she kept reminding herself . Still . She gave Chris a wicked grin as she reached out to mess up the magazines on the coffee table . It felt satisfying , even though she knew he would just restack them later . Chris was deep into what his colleagues called " groundbreaking " research on the human brain-specifically the hippocampus-at NYU Medical Center . He wanted a shared home and , eventually , kids .
