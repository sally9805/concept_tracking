<p> As the NBA evolves , the list of The 50 Greatest Players in NBA History " becomes outdated . <p> The list was compiled by a special panel in 1996 , but several active players have established themselves worthy of inclusion . <p> There were even some pioneers overlooked in the original list because certain players were n't allowed to play in the early days of the NBA . For years , the league was an all-white operation with as few as eight teams . <p> " When the league first started , they might play some exhibition games against all-black teams like the New York Rens or the Harlem Globetrotters , " said Earl Lloyd , one of the first blacks to play in the NBA . " But they refused to hire any blacks to play for them until 1950 , when the Boston Celtics signed Chuck Cooper and the New York Knickerbockers signed Nat Sweetwater ' Clifton . <p> " Even then , they integrated rosters very slowly . So there were black players who could have done very , very well in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . " <p> These included gifted , flashy players such as guard William " Pop " Gates ( right ) and " Wee Willie " Smith , who were limited to barnstorming teams . <p> With this in mind , I offer you a revised list of the 50 best players , a list that will need updating periodically as new stars flash on the scene . <p> " That 's to be expected because some of the players today may not be that great right now , but you have every reason to believe they will be , " said Bulls broadcast analyst Johnny " Red " Kerr , who played in the NBA for 12 seasons . " When that first list came out , a lot of people were upset that Shaquille O'Neal was on it . He had only been in the league four seasons and had not yet won any championships . " <p> But O'Neal , who played his first four seasons with the Orlando Magic , was averaging anywhere from 23.4 points to 29.3 points , and from 11 rebounds to 13.9 rebounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three NBA championships with the Los Angeles Lakers , have vindicated the panel . <p> Here is my revised list of the 50 greatest players : <p> 50William " Pop " Gates , G , 6-2 : He was the star on the all-black New York Rens . In 1939 , he led them to a 112-7 record that included 68 victories in a row . Former New York Knicks coach Red Holzman called Gates " the greatest player around in his day . " But white teams refused to sign him . He symbolizes countless who were denied . <p> 49George Mikan , C , 6-10 : At 245 pounds , he would be a little too light for a center today , and his limited shooting range would force him to take a lot of beatings banging with bigger players in the lane . At a time when he was consistently the biggest player on the floor , he averaged 22.6 points and 13.4 rebounds during his nine-year career . <p> 48Bob Cousy , G , 6-1 : He had the good fortune to play on the Boston Celtics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Havlicek , Sam Jones , Bailey Howell and Don Nelson and earned six championship rings . But he was gifted in his own right , averaging 18.4 points , 7.5 assists and 5.2 rebounds . <p> 47John Havlicek , G , 6-5 : He was deadly as a spot-up shooter from the wings , capping fast breaks with sweet jumpers . His defense was decent , and he exhibited sound fundamentals as he helped lead the Celtics to eight NBA titles . He averaged 20.8 points , 6.3 rebounds and 4.8 assists in 16 seasons . <p> 46Lenny Wilkens , G , 6-1 : The NBA 's winningest coach is one of three men to be inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame as a player and as a coach . During his 15 seasons , he averaged 16.5 points , 6.7 assists and 4.7 rebounds . He coached the Seattle SuperSonics to the 1979 NBA crown . <p> 45Billy Cunningham , F , 6-7 : He excelled as a player and as a coach , but he was too slow and slight of frame for today 's game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in nine NBA seasons with the Philadelphia 76ers , whom he coached to the 1983 NBA championship . <p> 44Walt Bellamy , C , 6-10 : He never was on a championship team , but he was as big and as solid as they come in the low post in his day . During his 14 NBA seasons playing for five teams , he averaged 20.1 points and 13.7 rebounds . His main drawbacks are that he was slow and shot 63 percent from the line . <p> 43Rick Barry , F , 6-7 : Here is a guy who could run-and-gun all night , and he shot 90 percent from the line . During his second season with the Golden State Warriors , he led the league by averaging 35.6 points . He led the Warriors to the 1975 NBA championship . He averaged 23.2 points , 6.5 rebounds and 5.1 assists during his 10-year NBA career . <p> 42Dennis Rodman , F , 6-7 ( right ) : He is as weird and as controversial as players come , was an atrocious shooter and averaged only 7.3 points to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he has six championship rings , seven league rebounding titles and two Defensive Player of the Year awards to his credit . <p> 41Kevin McHale , F , 6-10 : In his 13 seasons , all with the Celtics , he averaged 17.9 points and 7.3 rebounds and was on three championship teams . His post work is some of the most impressive for a big man . He had a deceptive quickness to slither through defenders . <p> 40Moses Malone , C , 6-10 : The first of the preps-to-pros to make good , the 21-year veteran played his first two seasons in the ABA , where he averaged 17.2 points and 12.9 rebounds , and his last 19 in the NBA , where he averaged 20.6 points and 12.2 rebounds and helped the 76ers win the 1983 NBA championship . He lacked shooting range , but the three-time MVP was an outstanding low-post scorer . <p> 39Bob Lanier , C , 6-11 : He had one of the biggest rumps and two of the biggest feet in the game , and once he posted low , nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside-shooting centers in the game , he played 14 seasons and averaged 20.1 points , 10.1 rebounds and 3.1 assists . <p> 38Scottie Pippen , 6-7 , F : His forte was his strong defense and his all-around game . In his prime , he was the perfect complement for Michael Jordan . They led the Bulls to six championships . The 17-year veteran is expected to retire after this season . He averaged 16.1 points , 6.4 rebounds and 5.2 assists in his career . <p> 37Walt Frazier , G , 6-4 : He was one of the NBA 's first big point guards with deceptive speed and quickness and was a solid defender . In his 14 seasons , he averaged 18.9 points , 6.1 assists and 5.9 rebounds and led the Knicks to two NBA titles . <p> 36Pete Maravich , G , 6-5 : As basketball magicians go , few possessed the passing and scoring magic of this 10-year player , who averaged 24.2 points , 5.4 assists and 4.2 rebounds . He also was an excellent free-throw shooter . <p> 35Clyde Drexler , G , 6-7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast and quick and could shoot with three-point range . A member of the Houston Rockets ' 1995 championship team , Drexler averaged 20.4 points , 5.6 assists and 6.1 rebounds during his 15-year career . <p> 34Robert Parish , C , 7-1 : Like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , he was an extremely well-conditioned athlete who played 21 NBA seasons , averaged 14.5 points and 9.1 rebounds and helped Larry Bird and McHale lead the Celtics to three championships . The outstanding shot-blocker was also on the Bulls ' 1997 championship team and retired at age 44 . <p> 33Gary Payton , G , 6-4 ( above ) : The 13-year veteran and nine-time All-Star consistently has been one of the premier passers and defenders at his position . He plays conventional point guard in that he looks to pass first . He signed with the Lakers before this season , hoping to win his first ring . <p> 32Dave Cowens , C , 6-9 : He was one of the best small centers in the league , using his superior speed , quickness and shooting range to out-work bigger foes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebounds and 3.8 assists for the Celtics and Milwaukee Bucks . He helped the Celtics win two championships . <p> 31Patrick Ewing , C , 7-0 : He helped lead the Knicks to the Finals twice before losing to the Rockets and San Antonio Spurs . He averaged 21 points and 9.8 rebounds during his 17-year career . Now he is a Rockets assistant , helping to develop 7-5 center Yao Ming , who very well might replace Ewing on this list in a few years . Yao already has established a competitive rivalry with Shaquille O'Neal and averaged 17.5 points , nine rebounds and 1.9 blocked shots in his second season . <p> 30Bill Walton , C , 6-11 : Nobody knows how good he could have been because assorted injuries dogged his 10-year career , forcing him to sit out three seasons and limiting his effectiveness when he did play . But the heady defender averaged 13.3 points , 3.4 assists and 10.5 rebounds while earning championship rings with the Portland Trail Blazers in 1977 and the Celtics in 1986 . <p> 29Elvin Hayes , C , 6-9 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game and could kill teams inside and outside . During his 16-year career , the 12-time All-Star averaged 21 points and 12.5 rebounds and helped lead the Washington Bullets to the 1978 title . <p> 28John Stockton , G , 6-1 : The 10-time All-Star is the NBA 's career leader in assists ( 15,806 ) and steals ( 3,265 ) . He played all 19 seasons with the Utah Jazz before retiring after last season . He went to the Finals twice , but Michael Jordan kept him and Karl Malone from getting a ring . <p> 27Dominique Wilkins , F , 6-8 : One of the most dynamic forwards to play the game . He had tremendous shooting range and was one of the best dunkers in history . He averaged 24.8 points , 2.5 assists and 6.7 rebounds in his 15-year career . <p> 26Bob McAdoo , F , 6-9 : He played center and power forward during his 14 seasons , led the NBA in scoring for three consecutive seasons and averaged 22.1 points , 2.3 assists and 9.4 rebounds during his career . Revered as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50.3 percent from the field . <p> 25Willis Reed , C , 6-10 : He played all 10 of his seasons with the Knicks and led them to NBA titles in 1970 and 1973 . There was nothing flashy about his game , just a basic , aggressive , hard-nosed approach . His career averages are 18.7 points and 12.9 rebounds , and he consistently outplayed bigger opponents . <p> 24Tracy McGrady , G , 6-8 ( above ) : He completed his seventh season by leading the league in scoring for the second year in a row , averaging 28 points . This season , he scored a league-best 62 points in a game . Unfortunately , he does little more than score . <p> 23Jason Kidd , G , 6-4 : One of the most physical point guards in history . He led the league in assists this season for the fourth time in his 10-year career and has led the Nets into the last two Finals . He leads the league in triple-doubles and is consistently among the league leaders in double-doubles . <p> 22Allen Iverson , G @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player , but his professionalism and dedication to his craft are subpar . The No. 1 overall draft pick of 1996 has led the league in scoring twice and has distinguished himself as a top gun , a rugged competitor and gritty defender . <p> 21Jerry Lucas , F , 6-9 : The seven-time All-Star has a photographic memory to go with his picturesque game . He played with the grace of a ballet dancer and averaged 17 points , 3.3 assists and 15.6 rebounds during his 11-year career . In the 1965-66 season , he averaged 21.5 points and 21.1 rebounds . He helped the Knicks win the 1973 title . <p> 20Julius Erving , F , 6-7 : He dazzled legions with acrobatic layups and thunderous dunks , and his fluid moves helped elevate basketball to the category of fine art . He played his first five seasons in the ABA , averaging 28.7 points and 12.1 rebounds . He played 11 NBA seasons with the 76ers , averaging 22 points , 6.7 rebounds and 3.9 assists and helping them to the 1983 title . <p> 19Charles Barkley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make his accomplishments all the more amazing . " There 'll never be another 6-4 player to do what I did , " he said . The 16-year veteran and 11-time All-Star averaged 22.1 points , 11.7 rebounds and 3.9 assists . <p> 18Isiah Thomas , G , 6-1 : The Chicago native is respected as one of the toughest and most determined guards to play the game , and the Hall of Famer has achieved in every area of pro basketball . He once scored 25 points in a quarter and 16 points in 93 seconds . He led the Detroit Pistons to the 1989 and 1990 titles . <p> 17Jerry West , G , 6-2 : His model professionalism and outstanding basketball talent endeared him to the NBA so much that the league uses his likeness for its logo . He played 14 seasons for the Lakers , averaging 27 points , 6.7 assists and 5.8 rebounds . He helped lead them to the 1972 championship and masterminded the " Showtime " dynasty . <p> 16Bob Pettit , C , 6-9 : Though weighing only 215 pounds , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center in the ' 50s and ' 60s . He averaged 26.4 points , three assists and 16.2 rebounds during his 11-year career , and he led the St. Louis Hawks to the 1958 championship . <p> 15David Robinson , C , 7-1 ( below right ) : They called him " The Admiral , " and the Naval Academy graduate and No. 1 pick in the 1987 draft kept his Spurs shipshape . He played 14 seasons , averaging 21.1 points and 10.6 rebounds , and helped lead the Spurs to two championships before retiring after last season . <p> 14Tim Duncan , F , 7-0 ( below left ) : The No. 1 overall pick in the of 1997 , the six-time All-Star already has led the Spurs to two championships and has them in title contention again , even with the retirement of Robinson . He averaged 22.3 points and 12.4 rebounds this season and is one of the premier defenders in the league . <p> 13Elgin Baylor , F , 6-5 : If Barkley really wants to see what can be done with a 6-5 frame , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14-year veteran and 11-time All-Star who averaged 27.4 points , 4.3 assists and 13.5 rebounds during his career . It is said he could post up Bill Russell and pass like Magic Johnson . <p> 12Kobe Bryant , G , 6-7 : Through eight seasons after coming straight out of high school , many dub him as the second coming of Michael Jordan because of his great versatility and all-round talent . But while Jordan was 28 when he won his first of six rings , Bryant already has three at age 25 . He averaged 24 points this season . <p> 11Hakeem Olajuwon , C , 6-11 : During Jordan 's 17-month retirement , Olajuwon led the Rockets to back-to-back titles between the Bulls ' three-peats . He played 18 NBA seasons , led the league in blocked shots three times and in rebounds twice and averaged 21.8 points , 11.1 rebounds and 3.1 blocks before retiring in 2003 . <p> 10Kevin Garnett , F , 6-11 ( left ) : In his ninth season after coming straight out of high school , the MVP front-runner turned in a career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assists . He led the Minnesota Timberwolves to a club-record 58 victories and the best record in the Western Conference . <p> 9Bill Russell , C , 6-10 : At 220 pounds , there is no way in today 's game Russell could average the 15.1 points , 4.3 assists and 22.5 rebounds he averaged during his 13-year career for the Celtics , mostly in an eight-team league . He led them to 11 NBA titles and only shot 56 percent from the line . Yes , he had little competition . <p> 8Shaquille O'Neal , C , 7-1 : He calls himself the most dominant big man in the game today , and nobody will dare argue with the 340-pounder . He 's still in his prime at age 32 , and the 12-year veteran has the Lakers hot in the championship hunt again . <p> 7Oscar Robertson , G , 6-5 : In his second season , he averaged an unprecedented 30.8 points , 12.5 rebounds and 11.4 assists for the only triple-double average in league history .

He played his first 18 seasons with the Jazz , leading them into the playoffs every season while averaging 25.4 points , 3.5 assists and 10.2 rebounds . Injuries diminished his playing time and production to personal lows this season after he signed with the Lakers as a free agent . But he remains one of the best at his position . <p> 5Larry Bird , F , 6-9 : The self-described " Hick from French Lick " played 13 seasons for the Celtics , led them to three championships and averaged 24.3 points , 6.3 assists and 10 rebounds before injuries forced him to retire . His dedication to playing hard on both ends landed him in the Hall of Fame , and now he 's running the Indiana Pacers . <p> 4Magic Johnson , G , 6-9 : He smashed the myth that NBA point guards had to be little guys and that NBA centers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to five championships while playing all five positions as the need dictated . He averaged 19.5 points , 11.2 assists and 7.2 rebounds during his 13-year career . <p> 3Wilt Chamberlain , C , 7-1 : As the biggest and most dominant player of his day , he once scored a record 100 points in a game and averaged 50.4 points and 25.7 rebounds in 1961-62 . Despite averaging 30.1 points and 22.9 rebounds during his 14-year career , he only won two championships because he lacked a suitable supporting cast . <p> 2Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , C , 7-2 : Before retiring at age 42 , he played 20 seasons , averaged 24.6 points , 3.6 assists and 11.2 rebounds and led his teams to six championships . His trademark sky hook made him the NBA 's career scoring leader . <p> 1Michael Jordan , G , 6-6 : He not only has been called the greatest basketball player of all time , but the greatest athlete of the 20th century by ESPN . He played the first 13 of his 15 seasons with the Bulls and led them to six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awards , six Finals MVP awards , one Defensive Player of the Year award , two slam-dunk titles and three All-Star MVP awards , and his career averages are 30.1 points , 6.2 rebounds and 5.3 assists . <p> The original 50 <p> On Oct. 29 , 1996 , NBA commissioner David Stern announced the list of the 50 Greatest NBA Players .
