<p> The large storefront windows open onto a slice of Eutaw Street that has seen its share of dramatic transformations . Brightly colored buildings that have doubled in value in recent years stand covered in fresh coats of paint . Other buildings nearby await their turn , their boarded windows displaying " for sale " signs . <p> On a sunny downtown afternoon , a shopkeeper in one of the newly painted buildings pulls out a black and white photograph of a long-haired , bright-eyed young woman who looks more like the American Idol she hopes to be than the American Pugilist she is . <p> Milroy Harried , who owns the M Salon and Spa , speaks like a proud father as he points to the image of Franchon Crews  --  champion boxer , talented singer and proof that sometimes the answer is n't found by adding a fresh coat of paint , but by stripping down the layers to expose what 's underneath . <p> " This girl did a complete 180 , " said Harried , a close friend of Crews . <p> Over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a near-death health condition and tried out for " American Idol , " where her voice was heard by 34 million viewers . None of it would have been possible without boxing . <p> Since taking on the sport three years ago , Crews  --  a 5-foot-7 , 165-pound middleweight  --  has developed into one of the country 's top female amateur fighters , racking up a 21-2 record . A powerful puncher , Crews is the reigning two-time middleweight national champion and last year came within one victory of a world championship . On Saturday , she successfully defended her Golden Gloves national championship in Fort Lauderdale , Fla . She 'll compete at the world championships again in November in India . <p> Crews 's coach , Marvin McDowell , calls her a natural with a chance to make the U.S. Olympic team if women 's boxing is sanctioned for the 2012 Games . <p> " What she has accomplished in such a little amount of time is amazing , " McDowell said . <p> But even more important , the boxing ring was where Crews was finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her talent for so long . <p> " She 's come to see herself as a young adult , " said her mother , Sarah Crews . " She has goals and she wants to achieve those . She realized she does n't have to follow anybody else . " <p> Franchon Crews , who turned 19 last month , was born in Norfolk and grew up in the suburbs , mostly in Virginia Beach . She had three half-brothers , but her parents separated when she was eight , later divorcing . She and her mother lived a comfortable life until things began unraveling in 2001 when Sarah 's employer went out of business . Within weeks , mother and daughter lived in a motel . <p> After a few months , Sarah found a job that required a move to Baltimore . The transition from townhouse to rowhouse was rough on Crews , then 13 . <p> She attended Douglass High School , where her Southern accent made her a target for teasing . Classmates ostracized her and called her names like " Country " and " ' Bama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baltimore , she had a little country accent , " McDowell said . " You could tell she was n't from the area . " <p> Crews protected herself by hiding behind a facade . She learned that the only way to shut the other kids up was to act like them . So she started swearing . And when that did n't work , when the kids teased her no matter what , she resorted to fighting . <p> In Virginia , Franchon had attended magnet schools for gifted and talented children . But in Baltimore , Crews fought so much in class that teachers labeled her a problem child . She left Douglass and ended up graduating from Central Career Academy , an alternative high school . <p> " I had to deal with rejection , opposition , a lot of stuff , " she said . <p> This was the Crews that Harried first met on the street outside his shop . He was curling a woman 's hair in the shop one sweltering summer day in 2002 when he became distracted by singing that was coming from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . <p> Through his open front door , Harried saw an overweight girl in mismatched clothes and a bad weave holding the attention of the entire neighborhood with a song . <p> " She looked older than she really was , " Harried said . " She was a little homely dressed , looking like a little thug girl on the street . She was obviously a street kid , and she became a product of the environment she was around . " <p> That day , Franchon Crews took her first step in getting back to who she was . <p> Harried coached Crews on nearly every aspect of her appearance and behavior . Crews told him that she wanted to become a professional singer . Harried , who once worked as a show business hairstylist , wanted to help guide her there . <p> " He molded me , " Crews said . " He had it down to where he was showing me how to talk to people and how to sit . " <p> Harried introduced her to a new world . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and around Baltimore . Crews 's new friends were doctors and lawyers who told her repeatedly that she could do whatever she wanted . <p> Crews often showed up at the shop and sang for the customers , fulfilling requests for dollars . When the income from her job at the BWI Airport coffee shop is n't enough , she still drops by the M Salon to sing and make a little extra cash . <p> " She certainly would make the shop more interesting , " Harried said . <p> Over time , Crews 's skin improved . Harried started doing her hair . And she found an interesting way to get into better shape . <p> " She came to me and said , ' What do you think about boxing ? ' " Harried recalled . " I said , ' Anything that will help you with your weight sounds good to me . ' " <p> Crews went to the UMAR Youth Boxing Center on West North Street because a friend said she could lose five pounds a day by training there . <p> McDowell did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he refused to turn her away . He opened UMAR to be an oasis for youngsters looking to escape what he called the drug infested streets of this tough strip of Druid Heights . <p> A couple of girls had come to box before but none had stuck around . There was no reason for McDowell to think Crews , who at the time could hardly do a sit-up , would be any different . Instead , the grungy gym became her sanctuary . <p> Crews was a quick study who responded to every test the coaches threw her way . Against one male sparring partner , the sessions were so brutally one-sided that other fighters around the gym nicknamed the pair " Ike and Tina , " after the infamous singing Turners . <p> " I was challenging her and she just kept coming back , " said McDowell , a former professional boxer . " She started learning , started listening , started running , started jumping rope . " <p> More importantly , Crews was finding herself . <p> " It controlled my anger , " Crews said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was working out , I could see my body changing . " <p> After only seven months of training , Crews had lost enough weight to compete for the first time . She won . <p> McDowell entered her in the 2005 U.S. National Championships . But during training , Sarah Crews was robbed in front of her home . She fell hard to the ground , hitting her head and suffering internal bleeding . Doctors insisted that Sarah take a blood transfusion . Sarah , a Jehovah 's Witness , refused because it was against her religious beliefs . <p> For three months she lingered near death , suffering two mini-strokes and fighting kidney failure . But Sarah refused to let Franchon stop training to care for her . <p> About 30 minutes before her first match from the championships , Crews received news that her mother was finally able to leave the hospital . <p> " I thought if she could fight back from that , then I could do anything , " Crews said . " I was invincible . " <p> She went on to win the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crews , though her defining one came a few months before . <p> Friends convinced Crews to try out for " American Idol " but she said she could n't afford to go to the tryouts in Washington . Soon , Harried and his customers put together a fund to send Crews . <p> Crews camped out at the Washington Convention Center for three days before auditioning . She did n't make the cut , but her performance was good enough to air during the show 's season debut on Jan. 18 , 2005 . <p> That night , millions watched contestant No. 37054 take her place in front of the judges the way a championship boxer takes her place in the ring . <p> " So why are you here ? " judge Randy Jackson asked . <p> " Because I want to be a singer , " Franchon Crews said . " I want to be an American Idol for everybody . " <p> The judges gave Crews her cue and Crews launched into " A Woman 's Worth " by Alicia Keys . <p> After explaining that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided his usual stinging input . <p> " You ca n't be good at everything , " he said . " You know what I mean . You 're a good boxer . " <p> But what the 34 million people who tuned in that night did n't see were the tears streaming down Crews 's face . They did n't see the exact moment that Franchon Crews shed the last layer of the negativity that had cursed her for so long . She had found herself . <p> " You ca n't be good at everything , " Crews said , imitating Cowell 's English accent . " I 'm like , ' Yes , I can . ' And I will be . "
