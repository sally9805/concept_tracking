My wife wants a Comfy Town Bike . // Q. She 's looking for something thta she can use to run errands and ride on the road . Any suggestions ? - Pat Telljohn , OR Pat , before you two go bike shopping , you should understand the difference between a comfort bike and a hybrid bike . Comfort bikes generally are super-comfy mountain bike  --  type bicycles with very upright positioning , massive saddles and some supension  --  they 're best used for crusing the boardwalk . " Hybrids " are more utilitarian- thinner 700c wheels for speed , and positioning that 's slightly more upright than a road bike . A recent trend is costlier hybrids with high-end components for more serious riders who are n't willing to commit to drop bars and that strecthed-out aero position . For the very best of all worlds , your wife should consider a quality hybrid . If she plans on doing some serious riding eventually , expand your search to cyclocross bikes- they 're relatively light , built for speed , but more comfortable than a true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pump , I usually run 105-110 psi . What do you recommend ? - Jim Prado , CT Forget pocket-size pumps , Jimbo . They take forever and hardly ever measure up to their highly inflated cliams . Skip COsub 2 cartridges- your 're on tour , not on a race course . Do yourself a favor and get a full-size frame pump with high-pressure capability and frame stowability . One of my favorites is the classic $34 Zefal hpX . Its funciton is still unsurpassed in the pump world , while its two-position " pump " or " store " modes make it a breeze to operate and carry in the rear triangle or under the bikes 's top tube . Q. My 10-year-old leather saddle is giving up the ghost . I 'm a 200-pound long  --  distance rider . Any suggestions ? No embroidery , please. - Scott Hogue , OH Ten years is a pretty good run for a saddle , and it sounds like yours got plenty of mileage . You should feel mighty proud of that . It also sounds like you could use a slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my favorites , which beautifully balances comfort and performance , is Selle Italia 's 280-gram Turbomatic 4 . It uses clever little elastomer bumpers for rail mounting to help take the sting out of long hours on the bike , while its stitch-free , handcrafted leather cover should ensure another 10 years of happy pedaling . Q. I 'd like to get a lighting system for my commutes . What do I need ? - Dytan Kuckes , GA You want to look like a Christmas tree . There 's no such thing as " too bright " while commuting . You 've got two concerns : seeing and being seen . Most states require some sort of handlebar and taillight , but that 's just a starting point for real safety . I run a NiteRider Digital Pro up front with a red flashing LED taillight at my tush . That 's plenty of light power ( 10- and 20-watt bulbs ) for me to see what I need to on the road and on the trail . The being-seen part can get tricky . I run enough flashers , strobes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but come 6:30 , when I 'm riding with a bunch of Southern California drivers hell-bent on making it back to their townhomes , I want to glow , and a handlebar-mounted system is my weapon of choice . You do n't need the most expensive lighting system you can find ( although decent systems will cost you $100 or more ) , but make sure you spend some cash on a nice assortment of " please do n't cream me " paraphernalia . No matter how goofy it looks in the shop , your goal is to be seen so you can make it home in one piece .
