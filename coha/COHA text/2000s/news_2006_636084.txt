<p> It can be difficult to find positives in defeat , but the Cubs might have found something in their 5-3 loss to the Detroit Tigers on Friday  --  another starting pitcher for their ever-changing rotation . <p> Angel Guzman appears likely to get another chance as Glendon Rusch heads back to the bullpen based on their performances Friday in the Cubs ' fourth consecutive loss . Rusch lasted only 1* innings after the Tigers pounced on him with four runs and six hits , but Guzman excelled in the second relief appearance of his young career . <p> That 's the best outing he 's had here , and the longest , " manager Dusty Baker said of Guzman , who worked 5 innings , limiting the Tigers to one run and three hits while striking out eight . He 's throwing a lot better than he did originally his first recall from Class AAA Iowa on April 26 . " <p> Guzman , 24 , considered one of the Cubs ' top pitching prospects , was ineffective in his first stay with the team , going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent back to Iowa on May 13 . <p> I was trying to be too perfect before , " he said . Now I 'm just relaxing . I felt pretty good today coming out of the bullpen . I 'm just trying to do my job and whatever they ask me to do . If they need me to come out of the bullpen , I will . If they need me to start , I will . " <p> Rusch ( 2-7 ) has been doing the same thing , trying to pick up a rotation hobbled by injuries to Kerry Wood and Mark Prior . But his second consecutive poor outing and Guzman 's showing have put the handwriting on the wall . <p> My location was terrible , " Rusch said . Everything was up , I got behind in the count and they took advantage . I feel I was trying to be aggressive , but I did n't execute pitches the way I can . <p> I have n't thought about going back to the bullpen . I assume that 's where I 'll end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . We need something that will change things for the better for us , and that might help . " <p> Against the team with the most victories in the majors ( 44 ) , falling behind early spelled doom for the Cubs , who continue to struggle hitting with runners in scoring position . The Cubs had only five hits against Tigers starter Nate Robertson ( 7-3 ) , three by catcher Henry Blanco , including his first home run of the season in the fourth . <p> They scored their first run in the second after Jacque Jones led off with a double and scored on Blanco 's first single . <p> By then , the Tigers led 4-1 after putting up a pair of runs in each of the first two innings against Rusch , who gave up a homer to Marcus Thames , three doubles and a triple before exiting . <p> They were hitting him hard , " Baker said . And we 're not hitting the ball . We hit some hard , but we 're not hitting as a team . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aramis Ramirez in the eighth off reliever Joel Zumaya , but nothing happened in the ninth against closer Todd Jones , who picked up his 18th save . <p> They 're one of the best teams this season , " Blanco said . Glendon made some mistakes , and that cost us the ballgame . This is one of the best offensive teams in the big leagues , and when you make mistakes , they take advantage . <p> Blanco said giving Guzman a second chance might help things . <p> I think he has confidence now , " Blanco said . That 's the reason they put him there in the bullpen , to gain confidence . As soon as the young pitchers get that , I 'm sure they 'll show the stuff they have .
