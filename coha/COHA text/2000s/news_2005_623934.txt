<p> In March 2000 , Randall Pinson was working his way through college by selling cell phones and pagers in Salt Lake City . To make extra money , he and his partner bought about 160 Nokia cell phones in a liquidation sale , only to discover the devices did n't work outside of New York . They were about to eat a $4,000 loss when his partner suggested selling the phones online . <p> Pinson opened an eBay account and within a few minutes made back his initial investment . A year later , Pinson quit the cell phone business and went full time into online sales . <p> " I pictured myself working for a company , making good money , doing market research , " the 29-year-old said . " But this thing really turned my life around 180 degrees . I 've never been happier . " <p> Pinson is a case study in Internet entrepreneurship : A regular guy has a regular job until he discovers he can make an income selling online . But he 's not unique in the way he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Internet merchants since eBay began in 1995 . Ten years later , according to a recent study by the Pew Internet and American Life Project , 17 percent of Internet users  --  25 million people  --  sell goods and services online . Online auction giant eBay 's numbers are even more startling : In 2002 , the company reported 24.5 million active users of its Web site ; in the third quarter of 2005 that number rose to 68 million . <p> Although the exact number of Internet salesmen and women is debatable , the variety of goods sold is not . People sell land , houses , cars , electronics , jewelry , collectables and all manner of stuff . Even non-objects , like virtual weapons , armor and monetary units associated with online games like World of Warcraft , can earn a seller some cash . <p> Glenn Browne , director of the Institute for Internet Buyer Behavior at Texas Tech , says the increase in online selling is the result of new and easy-to-use software tools for the online seller . In years past , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of billing and collecting money . But new software programs have made these tasks easy and secure , enabling even the severest Luddite to sell a coin collection and take payment by credit card . <p> " The great thing about the Internet is how it 's equalized access , " said Browne . " Anyone with a computer and an Internet connection can sell . You go online and you have access to everyone else online . " <p> Early Power Seller <p> Marjie Smith understands that well . She is an eBay Power Seller , the designation given by the San Jose company to high-volume sellers who maintain at least 98 percent positive feedback from customers . Smith , who lives in Port Royal , S.C. , earns her living by selling Etienne Aigner purses and accessories online . In the early ' 90s , she lost the use of her right arm and leg in an industrial accident , and now uses a wheelchair to get around . <p> " Selling online allows me to do something I love , but still keep my own hours , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to the doctor or physical therapy . Customers do n't have to know about my disability , and that 's not what 's important . I have something to sell , and they want to buy it . " <p> The Pew study found men are the majority of online sellers , as well as people with annual family incomes of $50,000 . College graduates sold more online than those with high school diplomas . Nineteen percent of those who sell are white , while 17 percent are English-speaking Latino . Only 6 percent are African American . <p> Also more likely to sell are people who regularly use the Internet and those who have a fast Internet connection . Similarly , people who have been online for more than six years were more likely to sell than those with less experience . And adults ages 29 to 40 were more likely to be online sellers than those 18 to 28 . <p> Professor Sanjit Sengupta , chairman of the marketing department at San Francisco State University 's College of Business , said what 's fascinating is how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get started in business without some of the traditional barriers in terms of land , labor and capital , " he said . " Instead , people need only to rely on knowledge and intellectual capitol . This has created a new class of entrepreneurs . " <p> Sengupta pointed out , however , that many of the 25 million sellers are one- or two-time sellers . And while the number of eBay power sellers is substantial , he said , it 's not large enough to affect the U.S. economy . <p> Browne says that the number of Internet sellers will taper off over time , but that Internet selling will continue to grow and eventually reshape the way people consume . Online sales will not replace retail stores , he said , because most retailers have a Web presence in addition to their physical stores . But the phenomenon is sparking an evolutionary change in who shops and how . <p> The manner of online selling is also evolving . Randall Chemel runs an eBay drop-off store in a mall in Woodland Hills ( Los Angeles County ) with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a franchise , called iSoldIt , that includes 158 stores nationwide in which people bring items to the franchisees to sell online . The Chemels take 30 percent of the item 's sale price up to $500 and 20 percent of anything over that . <p> Chemel 's story is fairly common : After the Internet bubble burst , he was laid off from his job . Because he worked in the recording and video industry , he had wrestling videos , concert T-shirts and the like lying around . He could n't get another job immediately , so he started selling his stash online . <p> " Twenty-thousand sales later , I now own an eBay store and we 're doing pretty well , " he said . <p> Quick and easy money is far from guaranteed by selling online . Pinson studies products and markets to maximize profit . <p> " There 's great potential , but there 's also great risk , " he said . " I 'd like to say it 's all skill , but there 's also a certain amount of luck and intuition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has to be knowledgeable about what sells  --  and for how much . People watch collectibles shows on TV , or read stories about online sales , and come to him expecting large amounts for antique goods . But he said prices for online sales have leveled off , due to the vast quantity of merchandise available . <p> Meanwhile , across the continent in South Carolina , Smith , a disabled single mother with two kids , sells a cornucopia of things online : kangaroo leather items , books , lights made to look like knights , cookie jars , salt-and-pepper shakers , platters . <p> Started with Beanie Babies <p> She got into online sales in 1997 , when a friend mentioned she sold Beanie Babies through eBay and made a nice profit . Smith looked around her home . There were Beanie Babies everywhere . <p> In addition to specializing in sales of the Etienne Aigner line of women 's accessories , Smith has started an association for disabled people , at www.doua.org . Through the association , she teaches other people with handicaps to sell online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an excuse , " she said . " We have people with every form of disability , from quadriplegics to the developmentally disabled . In some cases , it 's tough for them , and they have to have help . <p> " But it 's also very liberating to run your own business .
