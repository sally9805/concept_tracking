Chapter One Joni Peterson was removing her TV dinner from the microwave oven when the phone rang . Reaching for the plastic container with pot holders , she let the answering machine pick up . " Hi , it 's Joni ! If you 're calling me or Jeff , please leave a message ! " She was n't surprised when the caller hung up . Through the kitchen window , she could see the twilight fading across her patio and small backyard . A crisp October breeze ruffled her roses and the brush on the hill beyond . Near the edge of the dense woods above the house , a neighbor 's gray-striped cat prowled , then vanished into a shadow . Seconds ticked by , but there was no further sign of it . When she bought the house last year , Joni had relished the privacy . Now the remoteness of the place made her uneasy . A few drops of steaming sauce from the fettuccine Alfredo plopped onto the back of her hand as she set the plate on the table . Instinctively , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away the sting . Maybe she should have grabbed the phone . It might have been her eight-year-old son , Jeff , calling from his friend Bobby 's house half a mile away to tell her he 'd forgotten something for his sleepover . But if it had been Jeff , he would have left a message , she told herself firmly . Besides , he spent the night at Bobby 's so often that he kept an extra toothbrush and sleep shirt there , so what could he need ? She scooted into her chair and picked up the newspaper to read while she ate . As usual , she 'd barely had time to glance at it in the morning before leaving for her job as public relations assistant at Viento del Mar Community Hospital . The phone rang again . Joni picked it up . " Hello ? " A click , followed by a dial tone . Darn him ! The man knew exactly how to irritate her . Although she 'd signed up for Caller ID , the man had his number blocked . So far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been frequent enough to spark any action by the phone company . The other harassment - roses cut from her bushes and left on the porch to wither , a pair of sunglasses taken from her unlocked car and set on her patio - was n't threatening enough to concern the police , an officer had told Joni when she called . No one was going to arrest Lowell Peterson for anything less than a major crime . As the owner of Peterson Printing , one of the largest companies in the central California town of Viento del Mar , her ex-husband wielded a lot of power . As she rinsed the plastic tray and tossed it in the recycle container , Joni kept expecting the phone to ring again . Where was he calling from anyway ? His home ? His car ? The shadows deepened on the hill behind her house . On the patio , a breeze rattled the loose pedal on Jeff 's bike . She made a mental note to tighten it and to remind him to put his bike in the garage . Maybe she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain in the forecast . A night outside would n't hurt it . Joni retreated to the den , their combination guest room and electronic haven . Kneeling by the video rack , she picked out an old favorite , The Sound of Music . As she stood up , she found herself face-to-face with a group of photos on the wall . The largest , taken three years ago , was a formal portrait of her , Lowell and Jeff . She 'd hung it there in an attempt to keep her son 's life as normal as possible . The photographer had posed them on risers so that the gap in heights would n't be so apparent . Even so , Lowell had a commanding presence . Tall and blond , with a piercing light blue gaze , he 'd swept Joni off her feet when she was a nineteen-year-old clerk and he was the son of the company 's owner . Five years her senior , he 'd already been pushing for a dynamic expansion of Peterson Printing . Studying his photograph , she could feel the excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovering the intensity of his interest had enabled her to hold her head high on their early dates , even though she knew she did n't fit in with his country-club friends . Joni was n't sure what he 'd seen in her . She 'd been described as interesting-looking , with her high cheekbones and slightly crooked nose , but never beautiful . Certainly it had n't been her rather boyish figure that attracted him . How much had she really loved Lowell , and how much had she been awed by him ? It was a bit late , Joni told herself ruefully , to worry about that . Slipping the video into the VCR , she sat back to enjoy Julie Andrews and the Rodgers and Hammerstein songs . Half an hour later , she realized to her relief that the phone had n't rung again . Maybe Lowell had better things to do tonight than make a pest of himself . She was immersed in the movie when the wind picked up loudly enough to be heard over the TV . Storm coming , she thought absently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A crash from outside set her heart racing . The metallic jangle reverberated down to her bones . The bike ! It must have blown over . " Oh , for goodness ' sake , " Joni grumbled aloud . The last thing she felt like doing was going out into the nippy air and hauling Jeff 's bike to the garage . Yet if a storm really was starting , the patio 's cover would n't offer much protection . Joni turned off the VCR . In the service hall by the back door , she pulled on an old sweater and stuffed her feet into a pair of canvas slip-ons . As she let herself out , she flicked on the patio light . Its glow penetrated no more than a few feet into the gloom . " Here , bikey , bikey . " The wind tore away her feeble attempt at humor . Moist and chill , it blasted through the sweater as if it were a cobweb . She should have remembered to bring a flashlight , she thought , but going back inside was silly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible . In the faint light , the patio chairs stretched grotesquely . Unable to distinguish between shapes and shadows , Joni banged her thigh against the glass table . She let out a couple of swearwords she would have suppressed had Jeff been home . Wind gusted against her back , bringing the first drops of rain . Strands of shoulder-length hair whipped free of her bun and scrambled around Joni 's face as if attempting to flee . By the time the breeze quieted , her eyes were adjusting to the dark . She could make out spoked tires and twisted handlebars lying on the concrete a few steps away . Another blast of wind hit , and something arced through the air . As Joni dodged , she recognized the object as the hummingbird feeder she 'd filled this morning . The glass globe had been a Christmas present last year from Lowell 's grandfather , Herb , who doted on Jeff and remained Joni 's friend . It was a beautiful feeder , but if she had n't moved so quickly , the darn thing would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crunched on concrete . The hairs on her neck stood on end . " Who is it ? " Beyond the patio , she could n't see a thing . " It 's me . " ( Continues ... )
