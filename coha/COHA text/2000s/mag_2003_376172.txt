For skittish citizens who are n't frightened enough by disaster reports on cable news , police scanners or the Web , RCA introduces Alert Guard . The early-warning system , built into four new RCA TV models , gathers data from government watchdogs like the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , finds events that threaten your neighborhood and displays alerts right on the screen . When something is brewing , whether it 's an approaching tsunami or a mishap at a nuclear-power plant , the TV translates government-issued radio codes into text messages , audio alarms and colored warning lights ( green , yellow , orange and red ) . The TVs are available now and range from a 20-in. model for $299 to a 32in. for $849 . If they get cheap enough , some day you may find them in the same aisle as flashlights , bottled water and duct tape .  --  W.R.
