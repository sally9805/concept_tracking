She let me lie down beside her . But she did n't want me to touch her , and she did n't want to talk . I suppose we 'd talked enough by then . <p> She looked up at the ceiling , and blinked . The shades on the bedroom window were open , and it was early in the day . The morning nurse was gone , and it would be hours until the evening nurse arrived . <p> " How long will it take ? " she asked . <p> I fumbled out of my clothes before getting into bed . For an instant I considered remaining dressed . <p> " Not long . A few minutes . " <p> " Please , Charles , " she said , glancing at me , then away . By then I think even her fear had been taken from her . She was calm , and asking for calm . <p> Her eyes were gray , her hair black where it had grown in again . Despite the hollows of her temples , and the spikes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 'd drawn up the bedclothes to her chin  --  a plain blue quilt , white flannel sheets  --  as if it were cold outside . Even then she would n't reveal her body , and I had not seen it uncovered for weeks . As I eased in beside her the plastic crackled beneath us , and I felt the cold point of her hip against mine . <p> I tried to put my arms around her . I tried to hold her close , and whisper . But she shook her head . <p> So I lay on my side and faced her , and took her hand , and held it against my chest . I tried to stroke her hair , also , short and brittle and dry , but she shook her head again . I brought her hand up to my cheek , and held it there , which she allowed . The room was full of fresh air , but underneath the sheets there was the faint smell of urine , as her kidneys continued on , in ignorance . That was the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bathroom , she 'd said , that 's when . <p> I do n't know if I can , I 'd replied . <p> Then her last flash of intensity , turning toward me , sitting up  --  please help me , Charles . Do n't make me do this alone . <p> Her hand lay easily in mine . It revealed nothing at all , and I held it  --  neither warm nor cold . Her breathing was steady , and she blinked up at the ceiling . I could smell the apple juice on her breath . If she lay thinking , if she lay gathering herself , I could n't see it . For the first few minutes , each time I forgot myself , and started to whisper something , she shook her head . And so I did my best , as I had promised her I would . But I was weak anyway , far weaker than she . I shook and trembled , and she lay as still as a sunbather . <p> On they went  --  the minutes , the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she let me hold her hand against my cheek . I began to wonder whether it had been enough . She continued , minute after minute , breath after breath . I held her hand and waited , my heart pounding , though I tried to empty myself as she did  --  I tried to follow her , if only for a little while . But I began to sweat beneath the heavy quilt . Soon there were rivulets on my chest and belly , and her hand grew damp in mine . I closed my eyes for a long time . I held her hand as though it could save me , and then I felt it loosen . <p> Her breathing changed and the gasping began . I had dreaded that gasping for so long , and there it was at last  --  a steady hiss of inhalation , and then a long , mirror-clouding sigh , and then another , the spaces between growing longer , and then a cluster of breaths , and the beginnings of gray , as my fingers slid to the slow pulse in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then none . Her heart continued on , and her face began to change . A light blue , at first , in the lips , but then spreading , like water spilled on a table , darkening to the color of slate . Her heart was strong , but then it too began to go , and I knew exactly what was happening beneath my fingers , the skips and shudders , the pauses and returns , and then , as more minutes passed , nothing at all . <p> The yellow soap shone on the dish , the grains of dust lit up on the blue tiles below it . I heard the sound of a tractor in the cornfield behind our house . From the corner of my eye I could see my body standing in the mirrors over the bathroom sink  --  not young , with gray hair on its chest and thickening at the waist  --  not young , but healthy nonetheless . I tried to clear my head , I leaned my face briefly against the glass door of the shower stall , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the water . <p> All the details that awaited me , the telephone calls , the paperwork , the crunch of tires on the gravel , the prepared explanations  --  I was in the next room , I came and found her  --  and finally the bundle carried out , light as a girl  --  I let all of that dissolve in the steam , as it clouded the door , and encased me . <p> Only a few days earlier , when she was still able to sit in a chair by the window , she 'd told me that she loved me . Her words had caught me by surprise , and as I stood in the shower I tried to cling to them . I had n't replied , but I 'd put my hands on her shoulders from behind , then bent and kissed her cheek . She was trembling , but soon she stopped and looked out through the window and made a casual comment about the dry state of our trees . It was a warm day , and the industrial sprinklers in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look out at them  --  the sunlight , the wide curtains of water and the millions of sheaves of green corn  --  and wonder how it had come for her there , through all of that . <p> <br> Continues ...
