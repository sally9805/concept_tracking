<p> FACE IT : Those Brittanica guys do n't give a damn about your sex life or your career . But we do . That 's why we assembled our big A-to-Z book of style : It has definitive clothes and grooming tips that will not only make you look smart , but more important , make her look twice . Turn a page , turn a head . ATTITUDE <p> IN SPORTS , THE SWEET SPOT IS THE MIDDLE OF THE CLUB FACE , the place where power seems effortless and effort a mere rumor . When it comes to style , the sweet spot is that just-so frame of mind , an attitude , somehow both quiet and assertive , that says you 're enthused about your life  --  and on your way to the next great thing . A meeting ? An assignation ? A party ? A ball game with your boy ? Something good is next , shouts everything about the man with style . Sure , good clothes count . Good taste can come in handy , too . But nothing means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the author of this tale . ARGYLE <p> THE SCOTS introduced this diamond pattern and golf to the world ; that 's why argyle spreads kudzu-like across the fairways . It 's the most formal of informal looks , but do n't wear it with dress pants or mix it with other patterns . Khakis and jeans support it just fine . Underneath an argyle sweater , wear a solid shirt , preferably white . Or match your shirt color to a shade in the argyle pattern . ATHLETIC APPAREL <p> Engines have to cool . Maximize how effectively you dissipate heat by working out in clothes made of moisture-transfer microfiber . Modern technical fabrics like Nike 's Dri-FIT and DuPont 's CoolMax draw moisture away from your skin and disperse it , so you cool more quickly . If you wear your all-cotton Abba T-shirt , you 'll overheat in that fifth-set tiebreaker . Do n't let that smug creep Agassi win again . BELTS <p> MOST MEN KNOW THE BELT BASICS : Match it to your shoes and watchband ; the end should pass through the first pant loop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reptile is best . When you 're just starting out , we 'll let you get away with the claim that brown is brown . But once you 're over 25 , we 'll expect you to notice that chestnut brown shoes do n't match a midnight brown belt . Build a belt collection so you can correctly mirror the hues of all your shoes . BOOTS <p> UNLESS YOU LIVE in Denver or Dallas , it 's hard for a city guy to get away with cowboy boots . But a wide range of boots has joined work boots and hiking boots on the list of options . Match your boot to the roughness of your pants . Smooth , shiny leather with dress pants or a suit ; rough , matte-finish leather or suede with khakis and jeans ; sport or work boots with your outdoor gear . CUFF LINKS <p> For an intimate preparty ritual , have your wife or girlfriend put your cuff links in for you . Maybe you 'll never get there , and you wo n't have to deal with those boring drones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man Look Good ( Without Making Him Feel Bad ) , says she catches men misusing cuff links all the time . Once and for all : The design is displayed on the backhand  --  not palm  --  side of your hand . If they have a stone or other color , it should match your tie . Silver goes with everything , and precious metals are considered the most formal . CHRONOGRAPHS <p> WE LOVE CHRONOGRAPHS because they let us delude ourselves , for a moment , that we have some shred of control over time , that we 're not just pawns trapped in its brutal march toward decrepitude and death . Dear God , can no one quiet that ticking ? The little circles on the faces of these beauties are called totalizers , according to Lisa Roman , director of marketing at Breitling . Some let you track long periods of time  --  your witness-stand ordeal . Others let you measure mere moments  --  a quickie in the potting shed . Some chronographs have a decimal feature  --  the numbers 1 to 100 arrayed around the dial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and want to be sure some poor slob does n't get a free minute of legal help . COLOR <p> GUESS WHAT ? WE 'RE TIRED OF BLACK AND GRAY . Even if this look , from the Italian design house Etro , is n't exactly your style , remember : Real men are n't frightened of a little color . You can add one element of color to your outfit to give it personality and panache . Try a necktie in a bold shade , a bright shirt that pops under a black suit , a pocket square with a tweed jacket . It 'll up the odds she 'll notice you from across the room , street , or stadium . CORDUROY <p> If the conversation lags , remind the assembled that , according to legend , the name " corduroy " comes from cloth ( cord , in French ) of the king ( du roi ) . Cords have moved down the social scale from royalty , so we wear them with button-down shirts and other casual stuff . Wider-wale cords are normally dressier , and smaller-width @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable , which means you 'll be wearing ( and dropping stuff on ) them all the time . So use this anti-stain tip from Janet Brady , a professor at the school of textiles at Philadelphia University : Blot the blob , do n't brush it ; then wash your cords inside out with a full load . The other clothes in the machine protect the fabric . Wear cords with a cashmere sport coat and you 'll look downright huggable . DOUBLE BREASTED <p> THE DOUBLE-BREASTED SUIT tends to come into fashion for a while and then fade out . But this timeless classic always comes back , oozing professionalism and style , says Suzanne Boswell , author of Menswear : Suiting the Customer . The conventional thinking is that it 's best on slim men because the jacket 's overlap adds a little bulk to the midsection . But the deep lapel on the side that crosses over is a sort of vertical line , and if the buttons form a V pattern , you may be able to trick people into thinking you 've actually got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build your suit collection , add a double-breasted for those moments when you want to look as though you 're already CEO . Remember the one inviolable rule : A double-breasted jacket is always worn fully buttoned . Pay no attention to David Letterman 's outrageous flaunting of that rule . He gets a pass because he somehow figured out how to make the networks give him all of their money , and because he makes us laugh simply by using the word " beverage . " DRESS SHIRTS <p> BEFORE WE KNEW THE RULES of combining patterns , we did n't venture far from the shore of solid-color shirts . But now we 've set sail , thanks to Alan Flusser , author of the just-published Dressing the Man , which is the definitive book on style for men . " When combining two patterns of the same design , the size of each should be as different from the other as possible , " says Flusser . If the chalk stripes on your suit are three-quarters of an inch apart , your shirt needs narrow stripes ; if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wider stripe . Same idea applies to checks : A windowpane jacket can work with a shirt that has a small-gauge check , but two large checks compete with each other . EYEWEAR <p> Your specs should contrast with the shape of your face and complement the color of your hair , says the designer Robert Marc . " If you have a round face , choose frames that are wider horizontally and have angles to them . If you have a square face , go horizontal , too , but with softer , more rounded shapes . " Gray-haired guys : Stay away from frames that have yellow undertones , including some tortoise-shells ; pick black instead . The flip tip : Men with blond or light brown hair should try the turtle look . <p> ROUND FACE : HORIZONTAL FRAMES <p> SQUARE FACE : HORIZONTAL FRAMES , ROUNDED CORNERS <p> NARROW FACE : ROUNDED FRAMES EXERCISE SHOES <p> Athletic shoes are best seen in your gym bag or blurring past the slowpokes on your running path . Wear them anywhere else and you 'll look like a guy who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you score the pair that goes both ways  --  the pair that looks as good with your Diesel jeans as it does on the gym floor . Favor dark shoes over light , a bold color over a bland one , and socks just over the ankle . FRAGRANCE <p> We dragged our feet on the whole fragrance thing , until we woke up to the fact that it 's just another way to get into her head , Sure , mastery of ancient Asian sex tricks will wow her , but why not get access to the smell center of her brain , too . A girl we love told us she gets hot for her guy whenever she even whiffs his cologne in the bathroom  --  even if he 's in Paris . Think of your fragrance as branding . Hey , smell-science guys , how about these scents : Baseball Glove . Sawdust , New Car . Spent Fuel , and Grilled Bratwurst . FOOT BINDING <p> Custom-lacing your workout shoes can ease a few types of foot pain <p> TRY THIS LACE PATTERN TO LESSEN THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YOU 'VE GOT A SMALL HOT SPOT , JUST SKIP THE EYELET CLOSEST TO IT . <p> GOT A SORE NAIL ? THIS PATTERN WILL GIVE YOUR TOE MORE ROOM . FOOTWEAR <p> SHOES TO CHOOSE We do n't like to gripe , but we 've seen too many men wearing suits with informal shoes like these . That 's a foul , my friend ! A suit calls for a more traditional oxford or monk-strap shoe . But when you 're kicking back  --  wearing khakis , jeans , cords , or a slacks-and-sport-coat combination  --  these casual shoes are great . And they 're very comfortable . Lots of shoe companies are designing air pockets into their shoes to explore new frontiers of foot-coddling . GYMBAG <p> William F. Wood , a professor of chemistry at Humboldt State University , is prepared to help you do something about the animal that died in your exercise duffel . If you have a canvas bag , toss it onto the washing machine , he says , along with 2 teaspoons of baking soda and your normal detergent . For bags made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a disinfectant spray , and toss in a fabric-softener sheet . GYM REVENGE <p> Here 's how to snap a towel . Now you can exact vengeance for that unpleasantness in 10th grade . Start with a damp towel that 's made of a thin cloth , says Loren Winters , coauthor of a study on towel snapping . Holding opposing corners , twist the towel so that it forms a tight roll . Grab one end and flick the towel outward with a wristy action , as though you 're dealing cards with intent to kill . Right before it hits the target and is fully extended , pull it suddenly backward . The timing is key , says Andrew Conway , author of The Bullwhip Book : You get maximal snap if you tug the towel back just before it reaches its full length . Prepare for retaliation . HAIR CARE <p> Thanks to capitalism , stuff to take care of your hair is customized for your type of thatch  --  be it oily , dry , African-American , damaged , or gray . Seize the scientific edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look your best , work from the inside , too . The omega-3 oils in cold-water fish not only-keep your blood vessels tip-top , but keep your hair from drying out , too . ( Hey , Salmon Association guys , no charge for this slogan : " No heart attack end good hair . " ) INTERNET <p> GIVEN HOW MUCH WE HATE SHOPPING , we should be working the Internet harder when it comes to scoring stuff . Yeah , you have to try a suit on , but for lots of staples ( underwear , socks , jeans ) and for one-size-fits-all stuff ( fragrances and grooming supplies ) , the Internet is a salesman-free dream . And for some items  --  that hemp tie-dye tee or the purple lace bustier  --  you might want to avoid the mall altogether . These sites will make your life easier . WWW.ESHOP.MSN.COM <p> This multibrand site offers links to hundreds of retailers , and it has a useful feature called My Virtual Model .

It 's like camo for a lost weekend ! WWW.BLUEFLY.COM <p> The buzz here is nothing you 'd want to swat at . It 's about the heavy discounts on cool designers who do n't usually hang around in modest ( price ) neighborhoods . HIGH SOCIETY <p> Black tie is your best chance to look wealthy and wise . <p> Every couple of weeks we break out the black tie to accept another award . If the Academy smiles on your screenplay , remember this lapel wisdom from style maven Alan Flusser when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been brainwashed into thinking that you 're short , choose the peaked lapel , with its upward thrust . ( We think a man is plenty tall if he can stand his ground . ) If you 've got angular features ( look like Johnny Depp ? ) , try the soft curve of the shawl collar . But if you 've got a mushier mug ( Tobey Maguire ? ) , the peaked lapel will sharpen up your image . <p> We know experts say you 're supposed to wear patent leather or satin slip-ons with a tuxedo , but we ca n't bring ourselves to do it . A slim pair of unadorned high-shine black shoes is as formal as we 'll get . JEANS <p> ALL OF THE MOST SOPHISTICATED people out there like to buy their jeans pre-aged , like these . It could be that it 's time we entered the modern era . Still , something in us likes to age our blues the old-fashioned way , while baling hay or laying pipe  --  at the very least , while sitting on our asses in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buy one cowboy pair  --  dark blue and stiff  --  and age them yourself by riding them hard . Once they 're vintage , see if they 're not your favorite pair . Going to a last-days-of-summer beach event ? Try a simple , classic look : faded jeans , a T-shirt , minimal sandals , and sunglasses . For the fall and winter , favor dungarees in medium to darker shades . KHAKI <p> If you live in a warm climate  --  let 's say south of a line from Richmond to L.A.  --  the color of your khakis is n't seasonal . But if you live in New York or near the North Platte , your khakis should get darker as fall heads toward winter . For Labor Day , the whitish shade in the middle is fine . But for the World Series , wear the darker color on the right , and by Veterans Day , pass muster with the olive-toned khaki on the left . After Thanksgiving , store your khakis until St. Patrick 's Day . KNITS <p> WOOLEN KNIT SHIRTS HAVE BECOME A STYLE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Remember , the finer the knit , the more it will cling to both your muscles and your fat . The collared polo shirt is best under a jacket or with dressier pants . The collarless round-neck and the V-neck knit are perfect with jeans . ( Exception : Very fine knits do n't jibe with jeans . ) A white T-shirt worn under the round-neck  --  showing just a slash at the throat  --  draws attention to your face . LEATHER <p> " NEVER STORE LEATHER in plastic or in any other closed container " says Ron Ten Hoeve , owner of Leather Craft , in Roselle , New Jersey . " It 'll hold in moisture , which leads to mildew . " Leather needs to breathe , like the creature it once was . If it gets wet , air-dry it away from heat  --  no radiators , vents , or bonfires of her stuff . Once a year , pop for a professional cleaning , which will run anywhere from $30 to $75 . LUXURY <p> WE DO N'T LIKE THROWING MONEY at a style problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second , where 's the satisfaction in buying a solution ? Still , there is something to be said for that one top-of-the-line , luxurious garment : the wool-and-cashmere trousers that drape just right , the cashmere sweater that is softness itself , the leather jacket you 've been eyeing . Wearing them may actually make you confident enough to score the money to pay for them . Sure , it could be you 'll end up paying the credit-card minimum forever . But at least you 'll have a killer coat  --  now , rather than who-knows-when . MESSENGER BAGS <p> BY NOW , these pouches are a necessity for the fully equipped man who has to carry a laptop , a cell phone , a PDA , and a veal parm grinder . These bags do , in fact , resemble purses , so we prefer to think of them as saddlebags . As we 're packing , we pretend we 're Pony Express riders , about to tear ass in a relay from St. Joe to San Francisco . Wearing the strap diagonally across your chest  --  as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full gallop  --  is the best style strategy for now . NECKWEAR <p> The striped necktie is rapidly regaining the position of prominence it once held under men 's faces , according to Alan Flusser . The striped tie helps a heavy man look less so . " Any line that angles across the body also works to slim it , " says Flusser . " The dynamics of the striped necktie magically chisel away breadth and softness from the face . " THE WINDSOR KNOT <p> This classic tie technique adds heft in front of your neck . OUTWEAR <p> We like the military style of this overcoat . Some claim that 's because we 're scaredy-cat editors whose idea of getting in harm 's way is wading through a clumsy sentence . To which we reply , " Well , yeah , so what ? Soldiers need somebody to fight for . " When choosing an overcoat , resist the temptation to buy trendy . You 'll have this coat a while , and military flair never fades , which can not be said for that Amish milking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your shoes by having a rubber substance called Soleguard slapped on the bottoms of all your leather-soled favorites . It will limit the breath-ability of the shoe a bit , but ask yourself do you really care about how well your shoes breath ? Mike Dubuque , manager of the Allen Edmonds store in New York City , thinks it 's a good investment , especially to protect your shoes on days when it rains . " Leather absorbs water , which depletes its natural oils . " Hear that , Seattle ? Lots of shoe shops apply Soleguard for about $20 . PINSTRIPE <p> We respect the time-tested dark suit with a chalk stripe . But we 're also pumped about a new development  --  suits graced with stripes in red , blue , or green , like this one , new from Canali this fall . We agree with Elisabetta Canali , whose father founded the Italian fashion house , that these suits are " the perfect blend of traditional and modern . " QUALITY <p> Our style man Brian Boy on the best way to build a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extend yourself only for timeless items  --  the navy two-button suit , the gray flannel slacks , the cashmere V-neck , the classic camel overcoat , the best white dress shirt  --  stuff that will always be in style . " Economize on things that may be of the moment  --  a shirt in a trendy color , the Dick Gephardt parachute pants . REVERSIBLE COATS <p> IF YOU TRAVEL A LOT , a switch-hitting coat like this one gives you versatility without having to schlepp any extra pounds . But that 's the boring benefit of its ambidexterity . Far more fun : no need to dry-clean until you 've spilled chianti on both sides , and the police will be looking for a guy in a blue jacket . REWINDING <p> Do n't throw out that coat because it lost a button . Fix it , sewing man . Start with two buttons : a large four-holed button for the front and a small four-holed button for the back . From the inside , push a threaded needle through the small button , the fabric , and then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the big button , through the fabric , and through a different hole in the smaller button . Insert a toothpick between the front button and the fabric , and repeat step one , making sure to go through all the different holes in the button several times . Then remove the toothpick , which ensured proper spacing between button and fabric so that the button will be easy to fasten . Wind most of the remaining thread around the strands of thread between the front button and the fabric . Tie off by making a knot with the remaining thread . SCARF <p> A woman we like once waxed warm about a guy she met at the Michigan-Ohio State game . Apparently our man was n't wearing a coat , just a bulky sweater , gloves , and a scarf , wrapped just so , once around his neck . This look  --  vigorous , wholesome , unfazed by a little wind  --  made her so glad she was a woman we had to stop her before she got to the ... well , before she finished the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to add a hint of color to neutral overcoats , and to actually look dashing , a trait displayed too rarely these days . DECK YOUR NECK <p> Do n't have that special someone ? Tie yourself up  --  with three different knots , <p> THE KNOTTED MUFFLER <p> THE HACKING KNOT <p> THE ASCOT SHAVING <p> RAZOR BUMPS are a stubborn problem , especially for African-American men . Bumps happen when whiskers curl back and grow into your face . If you 're prone to them , try using a product like Clinique facial scrub before you shave . Its mild abrasiveness will release one end of the ingrown hairs . All men should moisturize after they shave . Shaving can damage your skin , says Alexander Covey , M.D. , an expert on hair removal . An aloe-vera gel will soothe the skin and keep your face dewy , you handsome devil . SOFT <p> Consider a " soft " look to cover your titanium torso . Lots of designers , including Armani and Zegna , are introducing unconstructed , unlined jackets and suits , in cashmere and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inside of the coat does n't have a lining , it has to be stitched perfectly . But if your wear this jacket over this sweater , there 's a better than even chance that women of all ages will start touching you . One of the women in our office actually stroked this picture . SPORT COATS <p> THE SAME JACKET over three different shirts creates three separate impressions . Over a T-shirt , you look like Joe Hollywood . Over a mock turtleneck , you look like Joe Novelist . Over a button-down open-neck shirt , you 'll look like Joe College if you 're young , and Joe Dad if you 're not . Style secret : Do n't make your clothes specialists . Every garment should be a utility infielder . SWEATERS <p> In general , the rule is to match bulky sweaters with rough , textured pants ( as in a cable-knit sweater with blue jeans ) , and finely woven sweaters with dressier trou . But there is one useful exception . " Blue jeans and a cashmere sweater is a great look for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this marriage of opposites works . " Women just want to run their hands all over you . " TROUSERS <p> YOU DO N'T HAVE dear old Mom to pick stuff out for you anymore , so remember these rules as to the right length for your pants . More formal means more break . Jeans should have a slight break , just resting on the laces of your shoes . Khakis and other casual pants call for a touch more , breaking maybe three-quarters of an inch . Formal slacks and suit pants should have a more substantial break , perhaps up to an inch . When in doubt , too long is always better than too short . <p> CASUAL PANTS SHOULD SIT LIGHTLY ON YOUR SHOES : BREAK ? FROM BOTTOM . UMBRELLA <p> GO FORTH AND BUY A GENUINE , grown-up man 's umbrella . And then learn the right way to stow it . According to a woman we very much want to impress , it 's wrong to just collapse an umbrella and carelessly wrap the band around it , as though you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your pleats . After you 've tapped off the excess water , use a slow , dexterous hand to roll all the pleats in the direction they 're designed to fold . The move around the shaft is wristy , a bit like turning a doorknob . It must be done with purpose and casual precision . Then , with finality , roll the strap the right way , and snap the snap just so . <p> SHAKE OFF MOST OF THE WATER ( NOT ON THE WOOD FLOOR ! ) . <p> TANK OUT THE PLEATS UNTIL THEY FOLD HARMONIOUSLY . <p> WRAP GENTLY IN THEIR NATURAL DIRECTION . <p> SECURE WITH THE STRAP . ( DO N'T LEAVE IT AT HER PLACE . ) VINTAGE <p> Vintage clothes honor our granddads  --  sort of . But there 's one problem with lots of the genuine vintage clothing in thrift shops : It 's pretty small . According to experts at Jitterbuzz.com , a vintage-clothing web site , during World War II the average man 's waist was much smaller than it is today . But a handful of menswear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out vintage-inspired jackets and shirts large enough to fit our supersized generation . What could be better than a brand-new jacket that looks like it survived the Battle of Britain ? WATCHES <p> WE 'RE WATCH GUYS and think most men own too few , and do n't give near enough attention to matching their timepieces with the rest of their raiment . If you 're loaded , buy a bunch of different watches right away . But if you 're a magazine editor , build your collection over time . Vary your tickers as to the material , color , and finish of band , as well as the size of the face . General rule : thinner , shinier , and smaller means more formal ; thicker , duller finish and more bells and whistles means more casual . The just-right watch shows attentiveness to detail , which marks you as both a guy to hire and a man to love . WHITER TEETH <p> IF YOU 'VE GOT A HEALTHY MOUTH THAT CAN STAND UP TO BLEACH , heat , and laser action , you may be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tech has come of age . Here are your shopping options for optimal choppers , according to Richard Price , D.D.S. , of the American Dental Association ( ADA ) . AT-HOME BLEACHING <p> The dentist creates a mold of your teeth  --  like a mouth guard  --  to which you add bleaching chemicals . Then you wear the mold at home for half an hour twice a day . This process takes about 2 weeks and costs about $300 to $500 . IN-OFFICE ( OR " POWER " ) BLEACHING <p> This is often used to jump-start at-home bleaching or to treat a single discolored tooth ; the dentist uses stronger chemicals , which is where the " power " comes in . It 's a one-visit process and can take an hour . Runs between $500 and $750 . LASER BLEACHING <p> This method combines bleaching chemicals with laser heat . It 's quicker than nonlaser bleaching , and some people report good results . But the process is n't endorsed by the ADA , and it 's more expensive , running from $700 to $1,000 . LIGHT TREATMENT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and touchable ? Well , certain wavelengths of light along with a bleaching solution will also lighten your teeth  --  in just an hour at your dentist 's office . BriteSmile and Zoom cost between $500 and $750 . Neither method is endorsed by the ADA . WHITENING STRIPS <p> These adhesive bands have bleaching gel in them . You wear them on your teeth for about half an hour every day for 2 weeks . A 2-week supply of Crest Whitestrips costs $35 to $45 , and though these do n't have the ADA seal , several of our staffers were satisfied with the results . <p> BEWARE : If your teeth are not uniformly discolored , you may get patchy bleaching results . It 's also possible to end up with teeth that are too white  --  so they look fake . Talk to your dentist about these risks before you commit . ZIPPERED CARDIGANS <p> IF WE WERE REALLY IMMATURE , we 'd make a reference to the boyhood taunt " X-Y-Z ! " as in " Xamine Your Zipper , doofus ! " But we 're grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deploy if you 're sure you do n't want to be invited back . Fill a dinner-party silence with the fact that the cardigan sweater is named after the seventh earl of Cardigan , a British fellow who did n't disgrace himself during the Crimean War . Then add that sweaters were originally weight-loss devices : You sweat , you get slim , right ? At first , we were cool toward these zippered woolies . But then one of our guys showed us the way . Sometimes he wears a cardigan under a jacket , sometimes he wears it as a jacket . Zipping all the way up or halfway down , the man can work the sweater ; you can look everything from almost formal to downright relaxed . Add one or two of these to your arsenal  --  for versatility and warmth . STYLE AND THE AVERAGE GUY <p> We 've run out of letters , so now we 'll go strictly by the numbers .
