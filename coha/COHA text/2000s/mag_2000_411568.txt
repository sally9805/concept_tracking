// IN AN INSPIRED PAIRING , THE STORIED LIGHT AND STONES OF JERUSALEM FORM THE BACKDROP FOR THE LATEST environmental project by Dale Chihuly , whose indefatigable energy and imagination are everywhere visible at the Tower of David Museum of the History of Jerusalem , located just inside the Jaffa Gate entrance to the Old City . The idea forthe project- " Chihuly in the Light of Jerusalem 2000 " - originated with the late Izzika Gaon , design curator at the Israel Museum and friend of the artist , and was initiated after Gaon 's death in 1997 . It would by its opening , in July 1999 , comprise 14 installations and a retrospective at the museum 's multilevel compound of stone towers and archways , gardens and courtyards ( also known as the Citadel ) . Chihuly was attracted to the site partly for the many views it would offer of the installations . " I walked around the Citadel many times , trying to get a feeling for the **26;1217;TOOLONG the space or the room ' that developed overthe centuries .... I knew that Jews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would visit-as many as a million people would now see the Citadel in an altered way . " * The artist was also paying homage to the Middle East as the probable birthplace of glass 4,000 years ago , and ofthe invention of glassblowing some 2,000 years later . Ten thousand pieces of multicolored handblown glass made in Chihuly 's Seattle studio , as well as in Europe and Japan , were shipped to Israel in a dozen 40-foot containers . Some 60 people were involved in mounting the installations , including trained rock climbers who assisted Chihuly 's team in securing the sculptures to different areas of the ancient fortress . Of the installations , the 48-foot high Crystal Mountain , fabricated on location in six weeks , was the most complicated . " It was a new idea for me in almost every way , " Chihuly says . The bo-ton steel structure has 18 , ooo welds and nearly five kilometers of metal building rods to which were added 2,000 polyvitro crystals , a form of plastic .
