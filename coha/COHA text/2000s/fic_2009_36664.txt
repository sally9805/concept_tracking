The trouble with starring in a network television show about a bipolar dentist who is looking for love on the Internet is that no matter how deft the flossing puns , or how diverting the high jinks with your Puerto Rican hygienist , it all comes down to the time slot . For Mitch Gold , this was the unpleasant axis upon which his world spun . <p> " Hello ? " <p> " Mitch Gold , please " <p> " This is Mitch . " <p> " Hello , Fiona from Creative Artists here . Can you hold for Tim Zelnick ? " <p> " Sure . " <p> " Hi , Mitch , it 's Tim , and Angie Varone is on the line too . How 's our favorite bipolar dentist ? " <p> " Hi , guys ! So how did Molar Opposites do last night ? " <p> " Well , " Tim answered , " it came in fourth . " <p> Mitch stared out the window and noticed the parched garden . " Fourth ? Yikes . " <p> " Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You 're up against American Idol . But I talked to ABC . They 're still very committed . They 're gon na run a bunch of promos during Brothers &amp; Sisters and see if they can bring in more women . They just want it to do a little better every week . " <p> Mitch took a breath . " What were the numbers ? " <p> " Well , it 's a blue-state show , no question . The Hispanic audience eighteen to forty-nine was good , you were strong there . But you dropped in the second fifteen minutes . You pulled a 1.8 . I think the network would like to see a 2.5 . " <p> " Wow . " Mitch was quiet for a second . " They want a million more people . How can we do that ? " <p> " Hey , you never know . It 's a good show , " Tim said . " And you 're fantastic in it , Mitch , seriously . " <p> Angie Varone piped up . " I do have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wardrobe really dropped the ball there . She looked like a walking Jamba Juice . " <p> " Really ? " Mitch asked . <p> " Totally . Anyway , hang in there , Mitch . " <p> " Thanks , Angie . And Tim . See ya . " <p> Mitch went to hang up from the call with his agents but hit the mute button instead . In this fateful move  --  one that led Tim and Angie to believe that Mitch had hung up when in fact he was still listening  --  the truth leaped out from behind the telephonic curtain . <p> " Tim , you still there ? " Angie asked . <p> " I 'm here . Did you actually see that piece of shit last night ? " <p> " No , I watched Idol . I saw that skirt on one of the ads . " <p> " Well , it blows . " Tim said . " That never stopped a hit , but with a 1.8 , I bet it was behind the Weather Channel . I ca n't believe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . " <p> Mitch heard someone  --  probably Angie  --  take a deep slurp from what he imagined was a venti vanilla latte , with Splenda . <p> " They wo n't dump that many Hispanic viewers just like that . But I agree it 's a long shot . " She continued , " Mitch books a lot . But man , what is this , his eighth failed series ? He 's had his chances . If Molar Opposites gets canceled and Mitch does n't get another pilot this season , I think we should drop him . " <p> " Yeah . " Tim agreed . " Plus Mitch is a conflict with Willie Dermot , and Willie 's got more cachet and a higher quote . " <p> " Right , but if I have to take one more call from Willie 's bony-ass wife sniveling about her husband getting passed over for Jack Black , I 'm gon na open a vein . I 'd love to know which fucking intern gave that freakazoid my cell number . " <p> " Angie , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's give it till the end of pilot season . If Gold does n't get anything , we cut him loose . " <p> " Okay . " Slurp . " Where do ya wan na go for lunch ? Craft ? " <p> Mitch hung up the phone , lunged for his nine iron hidden behind the door , and began smashing it on the sofa . Fucked . He was fucked . Willie Dermot was going to get a hit this season and Molar Opposites would be canceled . That would mean the end of Mitch Gold at CAA , and perhaps the end of his career . And that he could not afford . <p> Six months ago , the Golds had embarked on badly needed renovations to their 1926 Spanish-style house , but the contractor had run off with the $150,000 deposit  --  perhaps back to Russia , who knew ?  --  and now they had no savings . Plus , the writers ' strike had added further financial pain . <p> A character actor such as Mitch might easily go two years between jobs . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting to befall the Gold family . <p> Should Mitch be dropped from his agency , he would have damaged-goods disease , and everyone in town would fear catching it . His auditions would diminish , and the ones he got would become perilously fraught , enveloped with the stench of desperation . Desperation was repellent to already desperate producers . Mitch would be reduced to Viagra commercials and trade shows to keep the bank from foreclosing . <p> June must never know . <p> June squinted up Sunset Boulevard from out the passenger window of the town car , which had slowed in front of a low-rise strip mall . She saw a liquor store with the R in LIQUOR hanging from its sign like a fallen rock climber , a Shakey 's Pizza , and a twenty-four-hour tattoo parlor . There was no evidence of a swanky nightclub . " Are you sure this is the block ? " she asked her husband . <p> " I do n't think those security guards are here to protect the pepperoni , " Mitch said as the car slid through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determinedly like ground controllers at Andrews Air Force Base . Mitch and June had indeed arrived at their destination , that rite of winter , the ABC All Star Round Up Party , a repository of cast members from all the network shows who gather to walk the red carpet and bask in the glory of good ratings , network executive adoration , and media scrutiny . <p> From the backseat of their town car Mitch and June took in the mass of clipboard-bearing interns standing on the sidewalk , and beyond them , a troupe of entertainment reporters crowded around the front of the unmarked nightclub . Young women in something approximating prom wear , their faces twisted with joy at being at a Hollywood event courtesy of a college friend who worked as a production assistant on The View , gathered near the door . <p> June felt something scratching her back . She reached behind her , and pulled a caramel-coated candy wrapper from the crack in the seat . She wanted out of the dingy car . " Mitch , why are we sitting here ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Mitch looked hopefully out the smoked window to the spot where , last year , at this very same event , one of the ubiquitous network girls had instantly materialized . At that time he had been on the massive hit Beverly Hills Adjacent , on which he played an alcoholic plastic surgeon . But that was last year . ( After Mitch made a crack about the head writer 's bald spot , his character , Dr. Hyatt , was killed off by a patient whose left breast he had rendered sans nipple . ) <p> For three minutes June itched behind the T-strap of her sandal , mulled the difference between parody and allegory , prayed that her four-year-old daughter , Nora , would not wake up at 5 a.m. again , and wondered with vague alarm if she had remembered to buy cake flour . Mitch chewed frantically on a wooden coffee stirrer that he had pulled from his pocket , one of the many he collected at Starbucks each week . It was a habit only slightly less off-putting than his proclivity for chewing the corners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said June , grabbing the masticated stirrer and shoving it in her open evening bag . " I think we are more than capable of alighting from this car unassisted . " <p> Mitch sighed . " We got an intern last year . " He craned his neck out the town car window . " I mean , look at America Ferrera over there  --  she 's got three ! " <p> June heard a voice in her head trilling in a loop that had become increasingly familiar after a decade of network television parties . Who fucking cares ? Who fucking cares ? But her mouth uttered the words she had also come to memorize for these occasions . " Oh , sweetie , you 're reading too much into this . " She leaned over and opened the car door . <p> On the sidewalk , eyeing the red carpet , Mitch and June were stymied . Where to go ? Finally a network intern , her name badge askew ( Syndee , a curious name for a pudgy white girl clearly from the Inland Empire ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hi . Remind me who you are ? " <p> " Mitch Gold . " <p> " And friend ? " Syndee said , glancing toward June . <p> " June Deitz . I 'm his wife actually . Thanks , Syndee . " <p> " Ah , it 's SynDEE . So , do you wan na do the carpet ? " SynDEE had already turned her eyes toward the limos arriving behind them . <p> " All right , " Mitch said , and walked to the rug 's crimson edge like a woman facing her bikini waxer . June trailed behind him . Suddenly the Golds were abandoned by SynDEE , who rushed toward a steel blue Prius pulling up to the curb . From the driver 's seat emerged the TV megastar Michael Thomas O'Shea . His car was quickly commandeered by the valet , who ushered it away . <p> With the help of SynDEE , now animated , Michael Thomas and his wife , the actress Cass Martin , were escorted toward the carpet . Just finishing an eight-year run on a hospital drama , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emmys , Michael Thomas was instantly enveloped in a swirl of flashing bulbs and reporters screaming his name . As one of the few African American actresses who could open a movie , Cass was a singular draw herself . Her espresso-toned skin seemed untouched by a makeup artist , and she was inches taller than her **34;705;TOOLONG husband . <p> With Cass in tow Michael Thomas ambled past Mitch and June , his phalanx of interns clearing a path around him . He wore dark jeans and a cotton T-shirt bearing the single word GREEN . <p> " Michael Thomas , " squawked a tiny television reporter from E ! " Who will Dr. Armstrong end up with in the final episode ? Deb or Sandra ? " <p> Michael Thomas countered , " You know , Brandy , tonight I really want to focus on what we in the Industry can do to heal our planet . " <p> " Of course , Michael . So . . . um , Deb ? " <p> June and Mitch bravely pushed on down the carpet . A shout rang out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mitch ! Molar Opposites guy ! " Mitch realized the voice was coming from a photographer , and he turned instinctively toward him , his face exploding into a giant smile . " Mitch , can you move ? You 're blocking Marta , " the photographer , moons of sweat soaking his underarms , said , referring to an arriving hot newcomer from Beverly Hills Adjacent . Turning bright red , Mitch tried to erase from his brain what had just happened . <p> Once inside , the first person they saw was a stunning Thai server sporting a long ponytail and white yoga pants and a loose shirt embellished with a large sun . Ah , Ra , sun god , June noted to herself , recognizing the preferred polytheistic deity for Angelenos ' yoga wear and nightclubs . <p> " Uh-oh , this place is full of wactors , " Mitch said , his word for waiter/actor . <p> June looked around . " Sweetie , this is a great sign for you ! Ra protected his people from the dangerous primordial waters of the underworld . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Two years ago Ra was a dangerous primordial 7-Eleven on this very same corner , " Mitch shouted over the din of music . He grabbed a glass of pinot noir off a passing wactor 's tray . <p> " TouchT . " June laughed . Finding humor in the face of humiliation was one of Mitch 's enduring charms . <p> " But you know what , " Mitch said , draping his arm over his wife 's shoulders , " your point is well taken . This is still going to be a fun night . Let 's drink the network 's wine , or try to find some scotch . Anyway , I 'd go to a cement-mixer trade show as long as I got a night out with you . " June reached up and squeezed his hand . <p> The room , which June noted was loosely  --  very loosely  --  modeled on the Temple of Hatshepsut in Luxor , was almost entirely white . Vinyl banquettes were arranged in circles around giant plaster lions in a crouch . The walls were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancing in what appeared to be a festival of Hathor , but who were probably modeled on a scene from that orgy movie starring Tom Cruise . <p> Mitch looked around to see if he could spot any of his fellow cast members from Molar Opposites . The show had been a midseason replacement for a failed comedy starring an extraordinarily expensive celebrity as a self-help-book publisher whose life was perfect in every way but one : relationships . Mitch feared tonight would confirm what his agents had presaged last week : Molar Opposites would be losing its time slot to yet another show , this one about a failing sex-crimes detective who is successful in only one way : relationships . There remained a glimmer of hope , of course , that his show would not be canceled , but the lack of an intern was the first dismal augury . <p> " Hey , I see Rich Friend over there , " Mitch said . <p> " Who ? " <p> " Rich Friend and his wife , Justine Fein . They wrote that lesbian show , Hi Moms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him , right ? Is n't he the one who wrapped his putter around a tree at Riviera ? " <p> Mitch chuckled . " It was a five iron , June . But yeah , I shot a seventy-eight that day . He did n't take it well . " <p> " Is n't it hard to write with one 's spouse ? " <p> " People do it all the time , " Mitch said . " Sometimes writers divide it up by genre , say action or comedy , sometimes the man writes the guy parts , sometimes the woman writes the female parts . It just depends . " <p> Bored by the idea of chatting up yet another television visionary , but intrigued with the idea of meeting the man attached to the absurd name Rich Friend , June agreeably grabbed Mitch 's hand . They sauntered over to the food station , where Rich and Justine were debating the choice of sashimi or Yorkshire pudding . <p> " Hey , Rich , how 's it going ? " Mitch said . " Nice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June . " <p> June studied Rich . He had the body of tennis player , thin , muscular , but without those weird bulging biceps that men in Hollywood often sported . In short : a handsome man who looked his age . <p> After a quick hello with Mitch , Rich Friend turned his gaze to June , looking at her with what seemed utter fascination . " Mitch told me you teach poetry at UCLA ? " <p> " I do . " June waited for him to look behind her for someone else to talk to . At network parties , few people even asked what she did for a living , and once they heard , they suddenly had to use the restroom . <p> Rich remained focused on her . " Is it true that you actually studied Nibelungenlied in its original German ? " <p> " Did Mitch tell you that ? " <p> " No , I Googled you . " <p> Slightly stunned , June felt her face get hot . " I thought people in this town only Googled themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then conclude . So did you ? " <p> " It was a long time ago . You forget Middle High German once you pay off your student loans . " <p> " Well , I 'm awed . " <p> The corners of Rich Friend 's azure eyes crinkled up and seemed to animate his entire face . June noticed his teeth . They did not blind her with bleach tones , and his lips seemed alert with impending cleverness . He looked like someone she knew , but she could not quite place him . <p> Rich 's wife chimed in : " After Berkeley I devoted a summer to reading all ninety thousand verses of the Mahabharata . I think I did ten . " <p> " That 's not the same kind of accomplishment , Justine , " Rich said . <p> June looked at Justine to see if she registered this as an insult , but her face revealed nothing . Her thick blond hair fell to the middle of her back , and she was swathed in silk scarves . She was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word " thin " to describe her either . She had warmly rounded edges , June noted , a sort of Kate Winslet , circa Sense and Sensibility . Her eyes , a deeper green than June had seen before , were partly obscured by her red oval glasses . <p> " I love that poem . What compelled you to take it on ? " June asked , though in truth she found it incredibly tedious . Justine spent several minutes explaining her fascination with India , seeded during her year as an exchange student in high school , and the two compared notes on a variety of authors . Rich chimed in : " Did Justine mention she could n't get off the toilet the first three weeks in Bombay ? " <p> Justine laughed a little . " It 's true . Delhi belly . " <p> June smiled at them both , wondering when the conversation would end . Mitch jumped in again , and began to talk to Rich about his new driver . <p> " I have an open spot at Rustic Canyon this weekend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I ca n't . Aspen . " <p> " So , another time ? " <p> " For sure , " Rich said . <p> Justine turned to Patrick Dempsey , who had just sidled up for a bear hug and plate of sashimi . Rich joined his wife and the TV star , but not before glancing at June once more with greater admiration than both the conversation and their minimal acquaintance seemed to merit . This was a sort she had seen before , the one who professionally shines his light on you , as if you were the first person he had ever met who actually spoke English , too , until the next customer comes along . Except that June , with nothing to offer the world of Hollywood commerce , was rarely the target of such an unfettered gaze . <p> " It was so nice to meet you , June . " <p> " Later , potato , " June said , oddly . <p> Rich Friend laughed . <p> Mitch and June glanced around , looking for someone else to talk to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was Willie Dermot , Mitch 's longtime nemesis  --  a possible Duke of Wellington to Mitch 's Napoleon  --  on an undersized white seat alongside his elegant , sharpfeatured wife , Larissa . <p> Willie and Mitch , both tall and the same age , had similar abilities to play sarcastic , law-enforcing , or unbalanced . With his dark hair and Eastern European features , Mitch was viewed generally as the " urban " ( i.e. , Jewish ) choice , whereas Willie , redheaded and fair skinned , would be the WASP alternative . And so it had been : two decades of the weatherman in a Hollywood blockbuster ( Willie ) ; town sheriff in a horror-.lm spoof ( Mitch ) ; sex-crimes investigator ( both , many times ) ; wacky friend of the bride on half-hour comedy ( Willie ) ; bipolar dentist ( Mitch ) . <p> " Shit , " Mitch muttered . " Why does Willie have to be here ? He does n't even have a show on ABC this season . " <p> " How do you think I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-five minutes describing the color pallette choices for the preschool auction . " <p> " Well , I hope you brought a swatch book , because they see us . " <p> Larissa 's snug sheath dress accentuated her perfectly toned biceps , acquired by daily classes between school drop-offs and pickups at a Brentwood Krav Maga studio . Her iPhone sat humming on the table , downloading e-mails about flower arrangements for teacher appreciation week and her next dermatology appointment . <p> June pulled on her dress . She had meant to get her hair blown out for the party , but got distracted cleaning the errant carrot tops and dried-out fennel bulbs from the bottom shelf of her refrigerator . Next to Larissa , June always felt as if her thighs were pudgy , and she tucked her legs close together as she sat down . June had an untidy elegance , with a slightly heart-shaped face , decorated with delicate features , like an antique teacup on display in a breakfront . Her auburn hair , which frizzed in the humidity , fell just to her shoulders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her eyes were dark brown , and held the bulk of her emotions , daggers when angry , dancing in the light when pleased . Her face , free of anything but lipstick , and her eyebrows , which were unwaxed , pegged her for " natural , " which in Los Angeles was not a compliment for a woman over twenty-five . <p> " Hey , man , how 's the show going ? " Willie asked , hugging Mitch . Over Willie 's shoulder , Mitch caught sight of a large network poster festooned with a montage of all the season 's shows . Among the eight-byten publicity shots of medical dramas , situation comedies , Beverly Hills Adjacent , and three glossies of Michael Thomas O'Shea solo , the promotional photo for Molar Opposites , smaller than a baby tooth , poked out embarrassingly at the bottom of the poster . <p> " Did you get picked up for the back nine ? " Willie pressed Mitch . June always wondered how Hollywood came to adopt a golf expression to refer to the final nine episodes of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use a swimming term ? The final nine laps ? She mused about this further , tuning Willie out . <p> " We 're on the bubble , " Mitch answered , now internally conceding that the degrading spot on the poster signaled the bubble had already burst . " You guys opened huge this weekend , " Mitch went on in a determinedly sunny tone , referring to Willie 's role as the voice of villain Poison in the animated film Super Roach . <p> " Number one in the country and I 'm a Happy Meal action figure ! " <p> Mitch mentally added up foreign residuals , first network showing , and DVD sales of Super Roach , plus the toy thing . A million at least . <p> " That 's some bucks , " Mitch said . Larissa smiled and seemed to inflate like an anorexic puffer fish . June stared at Willie , who reminded her of that giant Paul Bunyan statue in Baxter , Minnesota . He had the same almost comically oversized shoulders , out of proportion to his scrawny legs . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacillate between overzealous glee and sheer bewilderment . June stifled a giggle , thinking of Larissa as Willie 's decidedly spindly blue ox . <p> Willie went on . " Hey , I caught your little film at the ArcLight this weekend . I wish I could afford to do quality work like that , but you got ta feed the bulldog ! " <p> " Yeah , ten screens , and I 'm an action figure at Whole Foods , " Mitch cracked . <p> June attempted to change the conversation . " So , who do you guys like in the governor 's race ? " <p> " Whoever brings down our property taxes ! " Larissa said , laughing . <p> " Well , property taxes are statutorily determined in California . In fact  --  " <p> " Yeah , right , I forgot about that , " Larissa interjected , hoping to head off yet another one of June 's newspapery blah , blah , blahs with a quick toss to the safe world of their children 's preschool . " June , will you be on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> June was amused by how Larissa and Willie , who were not Jewish , had thrown themselves into the world of Temple Beth Israel , joining the synagogue in order to get their daughter , Chloe , a spot at the coveted preschool . They had no intention of converting , but they had learned to pray phonetically so as to participate in the random bread blessing and Passover seder , even as they continued to attend the Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills every Sunday . " Um , I 'm a little busy this semester , " June said . <p> Mitch overheard this and began to smile broadly . " Hey , did June tell you that she won the William Parker Riley Prize ? It 's a huge honor in the academic community . And she 's up for a big grant this year , too . " Mitch was immensely proud of June 's professional accomplishments , which were many , though she rarely spoke about them . Two years ago , her students had nominated her for a teaching award at UCLA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in second . <p> Larissa clucked , " Oh , I could never have time to fill out papers for stuff like that . I have so much to do at home . You know , that 's why I left the business when Chloe was born . It is just so hard to work and be the kind of mom I want to be . And now I 'm busy looking at schools , which is a major execution , because , as you know , Chloe 's very gifted . " <p> June nodded , remembering that the last time she saw very-gifted Chloe she was chowing down on a dollop of paste . " Yes , that must be quite an execution . " <p> June thought about trying to activate that feature which makes your own cell phone ring and reached inside her bag to grab it , and a soggy wooden stirrer fell out onto the table . Larissa looked repulsed , and June quickly stowed the stick back in her purse . <p> At that moment a youngish man in pleated khakis with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hi , I 'm Owen Thrush from the Calgary Herald ! " he said . " Molar Opposites ! You 're big in Canada ! " <p> And so the lovelorn bipolar dentist gave his one and only interview of the evening . Calgary Herald . Roughly twenty-one seconds . <p> Q : Is mental illness common among medical professionals in the United States ? <p> A : I think we really are highlighting disabilities in an empowering way . <p> Q : Are you coming back next season ? <p> A : Here 's hoping ! <p> Willie snickered as Owen Thrush walked away . Mitch looked sheepish . The four made plans for a family picnic at Roxbury Park , which June knew Larissa would cancel , likely under the pretense of a hideous lactose incident that had left Chloe incapacitated . <p> Twelve minutes later Mitch and June were back on Sunset waiting for their driver . The hem of June 's dress had snagged on a plaster sphinx and her hair was beginning to frizz at the ends . June noticed a woman 's head bobbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " You do n't see a lot of postparty blow jobs anymore . Why ? " <p> Mitch peered over June to take in the action . " Shame , really . " June giggled , but Mitch began to stare at the ground . " We 're getting canceled . That 's clear . " <p> The driver pulled up and they poured themselves back into their repellent strawberry air freshener/Winston Light-smelling car . <p> " I seriously could puke , " June said . " What kind of person creates a cardboard strawberry , dips it in toxic chemicals , and proclaims it a nice alternative to body odor ? " <p> " You 're right . No more town cars to Hollywood events . Let 's move to Oregon ! " <p> " Oregon ? I do n't like the shoes they wear in Oregon . " <p> " What ? " <p> " Those ugly rubber boots . And what would you do there anyway ? " <p> " I do n't know , do theater again . Finally read The Faerie Queene with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Oh , gnocchi never works at home . Anyway , I 'll take that under advisement . In the meantime , here in Los Angeles , do you want to go to the Apple Pan ? The food at that party was inedible . " <p> " Why not ? " Mitch raised his voice , a bit too much as usual , addressing the driver . " Take us to Pico and Westwood please . " The driver tugged on his cell phone earpiece . <p> " Huh ? " <p> " I said Pico and Westwood . Sorry for interrupting . Thank you ! " Mitch pulled a new wooden stick out of his jacket pocket . " Was I just rude ? " <p> The car had turned west on Santa Monica Boulevard and June was looking out the window , trying to see if bougainvilleas were starting to bloom . In the wash of the streetlights , she could make out their hot pink buds , licking at the night air . " Yes , you were rather rude , frankly . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car pulled up to the famous hamburger spot  --  a mid-century shack of a restaurant slumped under the neighboring low-rise , its green faux-thatched roof seemingly sunk in on itself  --  and Mitch and June grabbed a place at the curved counter . <p> Sitting under a cloud of hickory grease , among lobster-shift utility workers , hipsters on their way home , and a group of drunken teenage girls in halters who maybe recognized Mitch , the couple dug into their burgers . June poured her Coke into a white paper cup . Mitch picked the tomato off his burger , tossed it aside , and snorted : " Big in Canada .
