<p> DESPITE PUNY SCREENS , PRIMITIVE TO NONEXISTENT GRAPHICS AND CONFLICTING STANDARDS , CELL PHONES AND OTHER WIRELESS HANDHELD DEVICES ARE THE HOTTEST ELECTRONIC PLAYSPACE AROUND . It 's game time . <p> Across the rainy streets of San Jose , CA , scruffy guys with laminated badges flapping on their T-shirts scurry into the city 's convention center . The occasion is the annual Game Developer 's Conference : Mecca for the programmers , artists and technological dreamers who design and code virtual worlds . The annual event is always the place to be for anyone who 's anyone in this multibillion-dollar industry . But on this Saturday morning , the buzz is even greater than usual . After a few days discussing vector units , quaternions and 3-D fluid simulation , they 're racing to talk about something truly heady , the birth of a new medium : wireless games . <p> Inside the conference room , a standing-room-only crowd has assembled for the " Wireless Game Summit , " a marathon exploration of the first new gaming platform in three decades . Among the development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Way back in the 20th century , Romero was cocreator of three fast-action video games that radically transformed the industry . Romero 's violent " first-person shooters " - Wolfenstein 3-D , Doom and Quake-let the player see through the eyes of a weapons-wielding character . With their mesmerizing 3-D graphics and over-the-Internet competition , these three games rapidly became among the bestselling offerings in video game history . Now Romero has started Monkeystone Games in Quinlan , TX , to focus on what he thinks is the next great unconquered space for gaming . " Everyone has a cell phone , " he says , " and everyone 's going to want to play games . " <p> Wireless games are played on Internet-enabled portable devices such as personal digital assistants and , particularly , cell phones . Though most of us are now familiar with the idea of getting driving directions or surfing the Web on a cell phone , the real killer app of wireless devices is games . Primitive-looking wireless games have already gained enormous popularity overseas . And bolstered by new software tools that allow game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the emergence of third-generation , or 3G , cellular networks , wireless games may be on the verge of commercial success . The New York-based market research firm Datamonitor projects that by 2005 , 80 percent of all wireless users in the United States and Western Europe-200 million people-will at least occasionally play games on their handhelds . In that period , the wireless-games market will zoom from less than $1 million per year to $6 billion , if the rosier estimates are to be believed . <p> This latest wrinkle in gaming has been a long time coming . Computer games were born in 1962 when MIT programmers hacked together an intergalactic simulation called Spacewar for a PDP-1 mainframe . Arcade games were hatched nine years later , when Nolan Bushnell engineered a coin-operated spinoff called Computer Space-and , one year later , Pong . The first home game consoles hit the market in 1972 . Though today 's games have achieved leaps in power and sophistication-from the massively multiplayer online world of EverQuest for the PC to the stunning graphical realism of Halo for the Microsoft Xbox-they essentially rely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't been a new game platform since the 1970s. the waiting game <p> Everybody waits : for school to let out , for planes to arrive , for dentists to see us . To the wireless-gaming industry , these unoccupied interludes in an average day are opportunities-minutes waiting to be killed with their creations . " There are plenty of time-saving applications , " says Paul Goode , entertainment platforms group manager for Motorola . " We 're working on the time-wasting ones . " <p> There 's a reason for this strong corporate interest . An estimated 60 percent of Americans play video games regularly , according to the Washington , DC-based Interactive Digital Software Association . That adds up to 145 million people , including 62 million women . Even the president of the United States confesses to daily bouts of digital solitaire . Despite the dot-com crash , U.S. sales of video games-buoyed by competition between the Sony PlayStation 2 and new home consoles from Microsoft ( Xbox ) and Nintendo ( GameCube ) - reached a record $9.4 billion last year . Americans spent more money on games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gamer is n't a pimply teenager , either : he 's a 28-year-old adult . <p> Thing is , adults have been largely left out of a sizable piece of this revolution . Nintendo has sold more than 100 million units of its hot handheld platform , the Game Boy . But not , by and large , to adults . The reason ? It 's a toy , and adults need to act like adults . They are n't likely to make room in their briefcases for a Game Boy ; if they do , they 're certainly not encouraged to whip out a fuchsia-colored hunk of plastic for a round of Pokmon . Cell phones and personal digital assistants have at least the veneer of business utility . <p> Enter wireless games-handheld games for grownups . Now cell phones can be toys disguised as tools . You punch up a " games " option on the phone , which connects to a server operated by your wireless carrier or a game publisher . The server transmits the data needed to turn the tiny screen into a playpen . Server-based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the need to carry game discs or cartridges . The server can also relay data between different players in real time , allowing for multiplayer competition : why play paintball by yourself when you could compete against someone in Japan , live ? <p> Indeed , Japan is the model for a wireless-entertainment culture . NTT DoCoMo , that country 's largest wireless company , has surprised and transformed the nation with a service called " i-mode " which allows subscribers to access games and other online entertainment wirelessly . The i-mode service requires a special cell phone with a slightly larger than ordinary screen ( typically three by four centimeters ) plus circuitry and software built in to handle the proprietary i-mode protocol . Users can access only the few thousand Web sites that have been modified to meet i-mode 's technical specifications . But there 's no dialing-up-an i-mode phone is " always on " the Net . <p> I-mode is phenomenally popular , engendering a " thumb culture " of 30 million subscribers-an estimated 80 percent of people worldwide who currently use wireless devices to connect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Paul Palmieri , director of business development for Verizon Wireless . " Clearly the biggest category within the content is on the game side . " the lure of the simple <p> I-mode games offer nothing like the whiz-bang explosions of a typical video game . The most popular game , for example , is Fisupeli-virtual fishing . Like most i-mode titles , it is text-based-no graphics at all . To begin , a player types " fisu " on the phone . A message appears on the screen describing the fishing environment . The player taps keys to select lures and rods-choices that will , ultimately , determine the chances of success at catching various kinds of fish . Simple ? Yes , but as seemingly timeless and compelling as a good round of Go Fish . <p> Given Fisupeli 's sparse graphics , one lesson U.S. game companies are taking from the i-mode phenomenon is that adult players of wireless games do n't need the bells and whistles that kids go for . On the contrary , adult garners prefer simpler games . Take an offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enticed more than 1.1 million people to spend some 15 million minutes competing against each other over wireless networks . That averages out to less than 15 minutes per player ; people play in short busts . <p> Gladiator 's popularity shows how compelling a primitive-looking game can be . The screen displays two combatants-you and your gladiatorial opponent . You manipulate a cursor to choose where to put up your shield and where to strike out . These choices are then sent over the wireless network , which compares them with your opponent 's , calculates the results and relays back the score . It is n't realism or beauty that 's driving the success of Gladiator-it 's simple competition and distraction . " Developers were making better-looking games on the PDP-1 in the 1960s , " admits Jamdat Mobile CEO Mitch Lasky . <p> Though Gladiator shares the simple structure of the i-mode games , it occupies a parallel universe . Playing it requires a handset compatible with a completely different standard , known as the wireless application protocol ( often referred to by its acronym , WAP ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's always-on connection . Unlike i-mode , however , it works on a wide assortment of phones . <p> Even more widespread are lower-tech games based on a method of wireless text communication called the short-message service , or SMS . This service allows people to exchange brief text notes , generally less than 160 characters long , by typing into their cell phones or other handheld wireless devices . Already widely used in Europe , text messaging is starting to catch on rapidly in the United States ( see " Message in a Bottleneck , " TR January/February 2002 ) . And it turns out to be well suited for gaming . <p> In China , for instance , a simple trivia game called Intelligence Quotient Quiz is credited with expanding the clientele of the wireless firm Linktone 20-fold in its first month . And last September , when Bell Mobility in Canada introduced a short-message service version of the popular game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire , the game was played more than 500,000 times during the first week . Games now account for more than half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's an even higher percentage than in Japan , where about a quarter of i-mode users seek entertainment and games . The massive popularity of these graphically simple games shows that an addictive round of trivia can be just as riveting as fancy color images of explosions and mayhem . <p> While the short-message service is popular in Europe and Asia , it is new in the U.S. The same goes for the wireless application protocol-available on only about one of every ten phones nationwide . Given the U.S. appetite for Millionaire-style entertainment , it and similar games will almost certainly hit these shores as wireless gaming infiltrates U.S. culture . <p> But that , code warriors at the San Jose conference proclaimed , is only the beginning . the wireless doom years <p> Think of Gladiator and Millionaire as phase one of the mobile-game evolution-analogous to the beginnings of computer games , with their chunky-looking graphics . They represent , in effect , the Pong years . Now we 're about to witness the start of phase two , to be ushered in by the deployment of newfangled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be the Doom years of wireless gaming . <p> This transition will occur in large part due to the advent of two new software platforms designed to make it easier for developers to create games for multiple devices , yielding a wider selection of games . One is a wireless variant of the language that powers much of the Web-Sun Microsystems ' Java . The Java variant ( known in the business as J2ME-for Java 2 , micro edition ) is now a feature on 15 million handsets and is expected to be standard on nearly all mobile phones by 2006 . The other is San Diego-based Qualcomm 's set of software tools called the Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless . Phones with this software-known as BREW-are already available in South Korea and will become available in the U.S. this summer from Verizon . While early wireless games are capturing a growing audience even with their low-tech look and feel , the more graphically rich games that the new platforms will make possible should appeal to a far larger audience . <p> Both Java and the Binary Runtime Environment offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boys . For example , rather than taking turns selecting moves and then waiting for the results , as in Gladiator , players might hop on the back of a tiny motorcycle and tear around an animated racetrack as an amber sun sets on the digital horizon . Or they 'll play a lush round of golf as Tiger Woods . <p> Because games developed with these platforms are downloaded to a handset-instead of requiring users to interact with a server , as with the wireless application protocol-the chief factor limiting performance is the device 's processor speed . Faster processors permit more complex games and smoother action . A typical cell phone chip today runs at around 200 megahertz-sluggish by PC standards . With wireless games , however , that is n't much of a constraint . " We made do with one megahertz on a Commodore 64 , " says Mikael Nerde-who oversees mobile gaming as third-party-program marketing manager for Sony Ericsson-referring to a popular home PC of the 1980s . <p> Developers can also make do-to a surprising extent-with the iow bandwidth of existing wireless networks . Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States and providing at least 144 kilobits per second of data delivery-ten times the capacity of today 's typical wireless systems-will have only a minor influence on most mobile games . Since Gladiator transmits tiny packets of data , for example , it works fine with today 's pokey wireless services . " We do n't care much about bandwidth , " says Jamdat 's Lasky . <p> While higher bandwidth will not itself do much for wireless gaming , it will still have an indirect effect . That 's because wireless-device makers are preparing to usher in the 3G epoch with a flood of handsets featuring larger and more colorful screens . The emergence of so-called smart phones-combination personal digital assistant and cell phone-also promises the more game-friendly interface of large color screens . <p> In another important development , some companies are also starting to make game-specific peripherals for mobile devices . Taiwan-based Architek , for instance , has developed a tiny cell phone joystick for players of Nokia 's Snake-a hit game in which players must maneuver an ever lengthening electronic reptile before it crashes into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Wireless will address another interface issue for gaming-the ability to execute certain tasks by pressing several keys at once . This capability , common on console game systems , allows for more complex character actions-such as a jump-turn-shoot maneuver . <p> All these technologies will converge to create a more varied gaming experience for the masses of gamers-as well as an appealing development opportunity for game creators . Calabasas Hills , CA-based THQ , for example , plans to introduce games that it says will rival in quality those it makes for the Game Boy Advance . These will include spinoffs of games based on World Wrestling Entertainment action , with animated wrestlers body-slamming each other in the ring , as well as Moto GP , a mud-slinging motocross contest . And while creation of a typical PC or console game can cost as much as $5 million and take as long as two years , the relatively graphics-poor games for mobile devices-even the next-generation ones-can be completed in six weeks for less than $50,000 . There 's no packaging , no retail , no muss . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romero. an imperfect world <p> The hard part still lies ahead , though . Despite the enthusiasm of the game developers and some early successes , wireless games face significant challenges . For one , the business case for wireless gaming is open to question : there 's no guarantee that consumers will be willing to pay enough for games to make their creation a viable business . The London-based market research firm Ovum concluded in a recent study that few people would pay more than 50 cents a month extra to play games on their cell phones and that only a tiny fraction of cell phone users-less than two percent-would pay $10 a month . <p> Arcade game players who have learned to milk hours out of a few quarters will also likely find wireless gaming a far less congenial experience . Wireless distribution means that gamers essentially get punished-instead of rewarded-for their skills . " If you 're successful at a network game , " says Ovum analyst Roope Mokka , " you end up paying more in airtime charges because you have a longer session . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reliance on wireless transmission-poses sticky technical problems . No matter how advanced wireless technologies become , there 's no getting around the disconnection that occurs when a player 's train heads into a tunnel . <p> Then there is the cultural issue . Japan 's affinity for the medium does not necessarily translate into U.S. acceptance . After all , i-mode has been Japan 's primary means of Internet access ; here , where most homes and businesses are already online , Net play is not such a novelty . Ultimately , wireless-game makers have to not only deliver the goods but compel adults to redefine the way they are entertained . Eric Goldberg , founder and chief executive of Unplugged Games , found out that 's easier said than done . The New York-based developer of wireless games had to shut down his company in December despite having struck deals with Verizon , Sprint and AT &T.; Goldberg reels off a list of problems with the new medium , ranging from cell phones ' puny memory to the lack of peripherals . The absence of a single standard adds to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goldberg and other game developers tend to see these problems as temporary growing pains rather than fundamental barriers . After all , with games comes ingenuity . A creative designer could think of a way to make such drop-outs part of a game . Some resourceful players have surprised companies by playing with their cell phones plugged into the wall to keep from missing the action when battery power flags . And in Europe , wireless gamers are embracing entirely new kinds of interactive experiences that turn games into entertainment services rather than products . It 's Alive , a company in Stockholm , is pioneering a new genre it calls " pervasive gaming , " which uses cell phones to lead players into real-life adventures ; participants are lured to locations in the physical world where they must uncover clues and gain information . The company 's first offering-BotFighters-is an assassin-style game that uses mobile positioning to alert gamers to nearby players whom they can " shoot " by typing text messages into their cell phones . <p> Ultimately , if mobile gaming does take off in the U.S. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number one entertainment business in the country-ahead of not only movies but also music . The stakeholders are n't just the 130 million cell phone users but the biggest carriers ( from Verizon to Sprint ) , the biggest game publishers ( Electronic Arts to Sega ) and the biggest manufacturers of hardware ( Motorola ) and software ( Microsoft ) . " Bringing Sega content to wireless platforms is another step toward Sega.com 's goal of bringing networked gaming to all devices , " says Ryoichi Shiratsuchi , CEO of Sega.com and general manager of Sega Mobile Japan . <p> At the very least , proponents say , the new medium might do for wireless technologies what earlier games did for computers . It was in large part to satisfy game players , after all , that PC makers pushed for bigger color screens and faster processors ( see " From PlayStation to PC , " TR March 2002 ) . This vision animates the San Jose conference goers . " We had a revolution take place in computing years ago because of consumers ' desire to have excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief architect of Morgan Hill , CA , game developer Fathammer , tells those gathered at the Wireless Game Summit . " We ended up with massive machines with powerful graphics . And because of this wealth of capabilities , the Web was able to come into existence . We 're going to see an equivalent revolution in mobile devices . " <p> The crowd at the conference cheers . Game time , it seems , is just getting started .
