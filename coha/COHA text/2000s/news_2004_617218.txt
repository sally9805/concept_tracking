<p> GOOD NEIGHBORS : ' Good ' not sufficient ; try ' great ' neighbor <p> If there were an award for " Neighbor of the Year , " my neighbor Don McKee would win it , hands down . Though retired and on a fixed income , he never stops giving . <p> I am a single , disabled parent whom he is constantly providing transportation for , and I am not the only one . He does this for many people , right down to the simple gesture of bringing flowers to brighten any day . Recently , I watched him spend more than $200 on food for a family with seven needy children . <p> If more people were 10 percent as compassionate as McKee , the world would be a sweeter place . <p> VERNOIKA MAY , Acworth <p> Accident victim finds friend waiting <p> James Coulihou , who came to my rescue during the recent mini-ice storm , epitomizes the good Samaritan , and I hope others follow his example . <p> While I was en route to work , my Jeep hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before flipping over the barrier and rolling down an embankment . I climbed out and walked back up to the street , where I saw Coulihou sitting in his SUV , calling 911 . He had me sit and stay warm in his vehicle while he called people for me and waited for emergency vehicles to arrive . <p> Good Samaritans still exist to keep giving Atlanta a positive image . Coulihou is one , and I hope God 's best for him . <p> FLO HARVEY , Doraville <p> Valuables safe ; so are values <p> I want to say thank you to the person who turned my purse in to lost and found Jan. 31 at the Wal-Mart on U.S. 31 in Acworth . <p> About 20 minutes after leaving the store , I realized that my purse was not in the car . As I was driving back , I called . They said it had not been turned in . But when I got to the lost and found department , it was there , intact  --  cash , credit cards , everything . They did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I ca n't reward that person personally  --  but I will definitely " pay it forward . " <p> KAREN BAUMBACH , Atlanta <p> General Assembly prayer : Responses to " Preachers must n't preach , " Metro , Feb. 7 <p> No sympathy <p> As I read of the Baptist minister 's remarks to the General Assembly that upset a gay female lawmaker , I felt no sympathy for Rep. Karla Drenner ( D-Avondale Estates ) . <p> Ministers of the Gospel undoubtedly step on some toes if they are effective messengers of God 's word . <p> FRANK PARHAM , Douglasville <p> God 's guidance not really sought <p> I was amused by the story of the Baptist minister who opened the General Assembly with a prayer essentially calling for God to guide the legislators to vote specific positions . <p> Of course when you look at the text of the prayer , it was n't a request for guidance from God on the issue at all . Rather , it was a statement of the minister 's own position , cloaked in a prayer . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the lawmakers , discerning , quite appropriately , that infusing partisanship into the opening prayer was inappropriate . <p> PAUL W. HINSON , Atlanta <p> Preachers should fight restrictions <p> I am not a member of the Macland Baptist Church or of the Baptist denomination ; however , it is a sad day when one member of the General Assembly complains , and now all preachers will be warned regarding their prayer content before the Legislature . <p> The speaker of the House should face political removal if he takes such an action ; this is simply not the type of representation that my household desires . The preachers of the area should unite and tell the Legislature that they will continue to speak with conviction . <p> KEVIN ARONHALT , Powder Springs <p> Minister was right to defend marriage <p> Kudos to the Rev. Richard Walker of Powder Springs for having the courage of his convictions to wisely warn the legislators of the seriousness of their moral duty . Marriage  --  the subject to which he spoke  --  is hardly a Republican issue , and God is certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our society , is imperiled today , it must be dealt with legislatively . But this does not mean that its definition is the sole purview of the Legislature . <p> Morality must have an authoritative foundation . The Christian believes that the foundation of true morality is God , mediated through the Bible . Others are free to believe what they wish about what constitutes morality , but it is absurd to tie the hands of a preacher concerning the making of declarations of a moral nature . <p> JEFF STRAUB , Acworth <p> Do n't kill message or the messenger <p> Legislators complaining about the prayers of ministers are the first to cry " academic freedom " when a teacher promotes a liberal agenda in a publicly funded classroom . <p> What do these members expect when they ask a member of the clergy to pray or speak ? A minister is accountable to God . The responsibility of the minister is simply to deliver the message . Complaints about a message often reveal a fear of being held accountable . <p> A minister with integrity will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editing and approval . <p> DONALD E. COLE , Albany <p> Liberals , leave now <p> Rep. Karla Drenner ( D-Avondale Estates ) has obviously aligned herself with the liberal Democratic revisionists who have willfully sabotaged and perverted the Constitution 's First Amendment , which guarantees the freedom of speech ( political and religious ) on private and public property . <p> Perhaps Drenner and her liberal cohorts would rather leave America and form their own country , where nothing religious would ever be mentioned in a political forum . <p> SCOTT BERRY , Monroe <p> Cobb teachers : Responses to " Lesson plan in diversity , " Metro , Feb. 7 <p> Forget race ; identify with best <p> A woman who had earned a teaching job because of the color of her skin was quoted as saying , " If they want us that bad , they must be willing to treat us good . " <p> Although she apparently has not mastered English grammar , the state and Cobb County think she is qualified to teach because minority children " have to be able to identify with someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was educated mostly by white males , but found that I " identified " with and preferred to emulate those who were educated and articulate , regardless of their gender , religion , race or sexual preference . <p> I would much prefer my son be taught by the best teacher , one who has mastered the subject matter and knows how to convey it , regardless of their culture . <p> STEPHANIE MERRITT , Canton <p> Asking for trouble in black and white <p> The article describes Cobb County 's efforts to hire minorities by hosting " job fairs exclusively to recruit minority teachers . " It seems to me that the Civil Rights Act specifically prohibited this type of hiring practice on the basis of race . According to the article , a minority teacher hired last year has since been promoted to " instructional lead teacher . " If it was because of her race , as the article suggests , this , too , would be a violation . <p> Although Jerome Morris of the University of Georgia says there are " white teachers effective in teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need teachers who look like the children they 're teaching . " Would it then be acceptable to replace a black teacher in a majority white classroom with a white teacher ? <p> RICHARD O. BRAUN , Fayetteville <p> Teachers stupidly ' dumbed down ' <p> One of the reasons our house in Cobb County sold quickly was the outstanding school system . All of that is about to change if the system implements its recruiting of minority teachers . <p> Laryn Kendrick , a teacher who is being recruited with 11 years ' of experience , said , " If they want us that bad , they must be willing to treat us good . " One would hope that she will not be teaching English . <p> Not only do we have to worry about the " dumbing down " of students . It seems that a bigger problem is the " dumbing down " of teachers . <p> CAROL COOPER , Gainesville <p> It 's about caring , not about color <p> I am very disappointed that the Cobb County school system feels that their students do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case , then Cobb residents need to be concerned that their school system is not teaching their children to appreciate diversity . <p> I am a white teacher in a predominantly black high school , and most of my students relate to me , mainly because they know I care about them and I try to relate to them . I believe all school systems should try to hire only effective , caring teachers , no matter what their race or sex . Students relate to teachers who care . <p> MARLA SMITH , Fayetteville <p> Darwinists ' evil agendas dishonor scientist <p> John Blake 's survey of religion 's reception of Darwinism misses a bigger picture ( Responses to " Compatibility test , " Faith &; Values , Feb. 7 ) . Charles Darwin himself wrote about success through random mutation , yet we make such a fuss over him because , through distortion , his work has been given philosophical conclusions not intended by Darwin himself . <p> " Darwinists " distorted the naturalist 's work in order to fabricate theories justifying apartheid , Jim Crow laws , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . As a scientific work , " The Origin of Species " implies no moral guidelines , no idea of free will , no concept of the human spirit and no eschatological basis . Such issues are addressed in the realms of religion and philosophy , which are not incompatible with scientific theory . People who seek moral or philosophical lessons in the teachings of Darwin are barking up the wrong tree . <p> SHAWN BUCKLEY , College Park <p> Brace yourself : Metal-mouth look is no fun <p> In a recent article , I disagreed with three points ( " Get this straight : kids like braces , " Buyer 's Edge , Feb. 5 ) . <p> The first was that kids like braces and that they are a fashion statement . Most parents have to make their children get braces , because the kids do not want to look like a " dork . " Colors just make this hard experience a little easier . <p> The second is that kids want braces in order to look better in pictures . Almost all the kids I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying not to show that they have them . <p> Lastly , the article says kids do not make fun of braces anymore . When someone is being made fun of it is normally for being obese or short  --  or for having braces . <p> DRIDRI ABRAMSON <p> Dridri , 13 , of Atlanta , wears braces .
