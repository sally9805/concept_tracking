<p> Southern Illinois found a way to keep coach Chris Lowery , a young , hot commodity who could have left Carbondale last spring for bigger and presumably better things beyond his mid-major existence . <p> Now , if Lowery , 35 , can find a way to replace his top two scorers , Jamaal Tatum and Tony Young , the Salukis just might justify their No. 24 preseason ranking that comes on the heels of their sixth straight NCAA tournament appearance . <p> Sophomore Joshua Bone , junior Wesley Clemmons and senior Tyrone Green seem ready to supply some offense from the vacated spots of Tatum and Young on the wings . Bone did n't play much as a freshman because of a foot injury but has untapped potential , and Clemmons has been a key sub for two seasons . Bone scored 13 points in 18 minutes of SIU 's revealing first exhibition last week , a 74-38 victory over NAIA King College ( Tenn . ) . <p> " People keep saying our best players are our big guys , " Lowery said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they dictate everything . " <p> The talk about the Salukis ' bigs starts with senior forward Randal Falker ( 12.3 points per game , 7.7 rebounds per game ) , the 2006 Missouri Valley Conference defensive player of the year and ' 07 preseason player of the year . Falker led the league with 2.1 blocked shots per game , ripped down 17 rebounds in a game against Illinois State and had 12 rebounds against Virginia Tech in the NCAA tournament . <p> Steady senior forward Matt Shaw ( 11.3 ppg , 5.7 rpg ) is an honorable-mention preseason All-MVC choice whose postseason ankle injury made it easier for Kansas to escape with a 61-58 victory over SIU in the NCAA round of 16 . <p> The offense is still in excellent hands with junior point guard Bryan Mullins ( 6.3 ppg ) , a two-time All-MVC defensive team pick from Downers Grove who ranked among conference leaders in steals and assists . Mullins is a solid floor leader who might be asked to score more . <p> Redshirted 6-7 small forward Christian Cornelius , 6-8 freshman power forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Illinois  --  and 6-7 junior Tony Boyle will contribute off a more versatile bench . <p> " In the past , we did n't have any guys that could come off the bench and make baskets , " Lowery said . " We needed the core guys to take all the shots and our bench guys to come in and guard . This year , it 's a little bit different . " <p> Guarding remains the Salukis ' calling card . They slow the tempo and let their tenacious defense carry the freight , allowing 56.2 points per game last season  --  third in the nation . They belly up on each possession , cut off passing lanes , box out and deny position . It 's an approach that has made SIU one of 12 schools to make the NCAA tournament the last half-dozen seasons . <p> Lowery , 78-26 with three MVC championships in three seasons , signed a seven-year , $750,000-a-year extension in April . That 's big money in Little Egypt . But he 's anything but satisfied . <p> " We 've got it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , what are we going to do to go even higher ? " <p> Northern Illinois <p> First-year coach Ricardo Patton has 17 roster-eligible Huskies , so there 's a start for curing his team of its last-place condition . Patton expects the numbers to translate into healthy competition and depth . <p> " It should be a very hungry team , " said Patton , who begins a new era in DeKalb after 11 seasons at Colorado . " We are only going to travel with 13 and possibly 15 guys this season . <p> " When you have 17 guys , they realize that if they do n't perform during the week at practice , they probably wo n't make our traveling squad . So it should create a level of hunger and great competitive fire among our guys , and I think it has . " <p> The Huskies , who went from first to worst in conference play last season , were picked to finish fifth in the six-team West Division of the Mid-American Conference . They think they can do better . <p> Seniors Ryan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pancratz , who made a team-high 51 three-pointers last season but wo n't be around to help because of surgery on his left ( non-shooting ) shoulder . He is out for the season . <p> Paradise ( 10.1 ppg ) , who shot 42.4 percent from three-point range , is the top returning scorer . He 'll share point-guard duty with sophomore Cody Yelder ( 9.8 ppg ) . Logan , a 6-7 power forward , averaged 7.6 points and 5.5 rebounds and did a lot of the little things in his first season as a junior-college transfer . <p> Jarvis Nichols , a 6-2 redshirt junior , scored 14 in NIU 's exhibition victory over Aurora , while Michael Hart , a 6-7 transfer from Carthage , had 13 points and six rebounds in a win against Augustana . <p> " Coach Patton gives us a lot of freedom on offense , " Nichols said . " We will run the ball a lot this year , and that will boost our offensive progress . " <p> Bristan Kelley , Sean Smith and Ben Rand should be in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's son Michael , a walk-on , are vying for time at guard . <p> Illinois State <p> First-year coach Tim Jankovich inherits 80 percent of ISU 's scoring with five players who started at least 13 games for a 15-16 team ( 6-12 MVC ) . <p> Guards Boo Richardson ( 9.8 ppg , 4.9 assists per game ) , Dom Johnson ( 8.3 ppg ) and MVC freshman of the year Osiris Eldridge of Phillips Academy ( 9.5 ppg ) return , along with center Levi Dyer , a 6-11 senior who averaged 12.1 points and shot 48 percent from three-point range but averaged only 3.3 rebounds . Anthony Slack is the returning starter at power forward and leading rebounder ( 5.7 ) . <p> Guard Emmanuel Holloway averaged 15.2 points at Iowa Western , USC transfer Sead Odzic is a good shooter and 6-8 Brandon Sampay adds a 255-pound presence inside . <p> The Redbirds were picked to finish fifth in the Valley . They play Indiana in the Chicago Invitational on Nov. 23 at the Sears Centre . <p> Western Illinois <p> The Mid-Continent Conference , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a new look . Valpo is out , and Indiana-Purdue-Fort Wayne , North Dakota State and South Dakota State are in . The Dakotas are n't eligible for the championship until 2008-09 . <p> **27;634;TOOLONG is the preseason favorite , with Western Illinois picked eighth in the 10-team league . The Leathernecks will be led by 6-4 all-conference senior David Jackson , the team 's scoring leader in each of the last two seasons . Jackson , recovering from a minor offseason injury , missed Western 's exhibitions but scored six points in WIU 's 76-56 win over Waldorf on Friday . <p> The Leathernecks ' schedule includes games at Kansas State ( Nov. 17 ) , Missouri ( Nov. 25 ) and UCLA ( Dec. 18 ) . <p> Eastern Illinois <p> The Panthers have the experience to improve on a 10-20 season ( 6-14 Ohio Valley ) with five starters returning , including OVC freshman of the year Romain Martin ( 14.8 ppg ) . That unit helped EIU average a paltry 59 points , but the feeling around the league is that the Panthers have the talent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were picked eighth of 11 teams by league coaches . <p> Martin , Bobby Catchings ( 10.1 ppg ) and assist leader Mike Robinson ( 10.0 ) man a triple-threat backcourt , with Jake Byrne ( 7.7 ppg ) and Ousmane Cisse ( 5.9 ppg , 6.3 rpg ) set at forward . <p> Jon'Tee Willhite and Julio Anthony will contribute in the backcourt . Anthony , ruled ineligible in December after transferring from a junior college , has impressed in preseason games . <p> Chicago State <p> The independent Cougars start fresh with a new facility and new coach Benjy Taylor , who replaces Kevin Jones . <p> Taylor , formerly a head coach at Division III North Central College in Naperville and an assistant at Tulane the last two seasons , inherits starting guards David Holston ( 15.6 ppg , 3.4 apg ) and John Cantrell ( 12.6 ppg , 2.4 apg ) from a 9-20 team that played only six home games . Guard Kevin Jones Jr. , the former coach 's son , bolsters a quick and experienced backcourt . <p> Except for 6-11 center Chidozie Chukwumah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a 6-7 freshman from Shepard , and 6-5 Tawrence Walton of Kenwood and Kennedy-King will contribute . <p> CSU will host 10 opponents , including Northwestern on Jan. 16 . <p> Bradley <p> The Braves were picked second in the Missouri Valley by conference coaches and have the look of an NCAA tournament team because of their outstanding senior guard tandem of Daniel Ruffin and Jeremy Crouch . Both averaged 13.8 points last season , when the Braves settled for the NIT after their NCAA Sweet 16 run two seasons ago . They won 22 games in each of those seasons under coach Jim Les . <p> Ruffin ( 5.4 assists , 2.4 turnovers ) and Crouch ( 50 percent from three-point range ) can shoot . And Ruffin , a preseason All-MVC pick , runs the show as well as anybody in the conference . <p> Up front , the Braves must endure significant losses but have promising newcomers in 6-7 Rashad Austin , who averaged 13.3 points and 7.9 rebounds at Northeastern Junior College ( Colo. ) , and 7-foot David Collins . Theron Wilson , a 6-5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of positions . They join returnees Matt Salley ( 7.1 ppg ) and oft-injured Sam Singh on the front line . <p> Junior guard Tyrone Cole-Scott , another junior-college transfer , turned heads by scoring 36 points in 21 minutes in a 110-84 exhibition win over Saint Ambrose . Cole-Scott made 10 of 12 field-goal attempts , including 6 of 8 from three-point range . <p> Valparaiso <p> Jumping from the Mid-Continent Conference to the Horizon League , it 's always good to have your top seven scorers back . Eight returning letter-winners combined for 94 percent of Valpo 's scoring and 87 percent of its rebounding on a 16-15 team . <p> Senior forward Shawn Huff ( 11.4 ppg ) , junior forward Urule Igbavboa ( 11.6 ) , junior point guard Brandon McPherson ( 11.3 ) , junior guard Jake Diebler ( 5.4 ) and sophomore guard Sam Haanpaa ( 12.0 ) make up the starting five , with sixth man Jarryd Lloyd providing point-guard and three-point skills . <p> Igbavboa was the Crusaders ' most improved player , Diebler their best defensive player and Haanpaa the first freshman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation with a 45.7 three-point percentage . <p> Homer Drew ranks ninth among active Division I coaches with 571 career victories . He has averaged more than 20 wins in his last 13 seasons at Valpo , where son Bryce again will serve as an assistant .
