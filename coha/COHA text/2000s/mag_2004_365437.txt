" KARLA KELLENBERGER Stow , Ohio <P> I applaud time for its cover story Aug. 23 on the vulnerable status of big cats ( lions , tigers , snow leopards , cheetahs and others )  --  surely one of the saddest legacies of today 's world . Human overpopulation , hunting , poverty and ignorance  --  along with the horrendous practice of buying and selling animal parts  --  have proved to be obstacles too tough to overcome , even for creatures as magnificent as the big cats you pictured . Every solution mentioned by the scientists and conservationists is worth trying . We owe these animals our best efforts .

" Best of all , by being some cat 's dinner , the victim contributed to its survival . Any man-eating animal is our natural enemy . Are we willing to sacrifice human lives to prevent their extinction ? RICHARD PACKHAM Roseburg , Ore . <P> Your report suggested that trophy hunting of lions and tigers might be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big cats wo n't be saved by allowing trophy hunters to kill the animals . Trophy hunting not only removes the biggest and most genetically fit animals but also helps create markets for big-cat parts  --  undermining the long-term conservation of increasingly isolated populations . Conserving big cats is a culturally and socially complex issue but not so complicated that the direct killing of the fittest animals can turn out to be helpful . WAYNE PACELLE , PRESIDENT HUMANE SOCIETY OF THE U.S. Washington <P> Save the big cats ! finally , a cover story to be enthusiastic about . A trek into the savanna  --  a land unpopulated by those other man eaters , Bush and bin Laden . What I would give for this vacation to never end !
