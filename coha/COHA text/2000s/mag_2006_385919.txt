We welcome a couple of Korean mainstream family vehicles to the fleet . first report HYUNDAI AZERA LIMITED A five-passenger entry-luxury sedan complete with wood trim , a leather-swathed interior and all the expected essentials for under $30,000 ? Pshaw , you say ? No really , we say . Well , how good could it be , you ask ? That 's exactly what we intend to find out Cars with the Hyundai name on them have come a long way from those less than excellent Excels of 20 years ago . And the Azera sedan is the company 's boldest statement yet . The big Hyundai 's catalog of standard equipment reads like most other cars ' Christmas wish lists-with everything from heated leather front seats to a power rear sunshade to steering-wheel-mounted audio controls to a full-size spare tire . And , as has been the company 's hallmark these past few years , its base price includes such items as eight airbags , stability control and traction control . But simply loading a car with features and not charging a lot of money for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know full well , many have done it before ( and still do ) . Executing it all well , with the feel , look and operation of a real luxury car , is a whole nother ball of wax . But based on our initial experiences with the Azera and with the one-notch-down Sonata , we think that Hyundai may have the formula licked . To find out , we 'll put our new Azera through a grind that begins with a daily turnpike-pounding , city-street-brawling , 100-mile-a-day commute . After that , we 'll ratchet up the intensity . - DON CHAIKIN Sleek , handsome and graceful , the Azera breaks away from the Korean econocar paradigm . It 's nice to see that some carmakers still include a cassette player in the audio system . But nav would be nice . VITAL STATISTICS Base price : $26,835 As-tested price : $28,415 Extra-cost options : Power sunroof , Infinity audio with six-disc in-dash changer , sunroof wind deflector Drivetrain : 3.8-liter DOHC 24-valve engine , five-speed automatic transmission , front-wheel drive Engine performance : 263 hp/255 lb. - ft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EX We confess to a soft spot in our hearts for minivans . And we can handle the heat , because despite the disparaging looks and comments we get from nonbelievers , we know we 're not alone . In fact , the legions of faithful buy more than a million brand-new minivans each year . Year in , year out . The vehicle that brought us out in the open is the Kia Sedona . At its press launch , we were so impressed with its simplicity , completeness and value that we ordered one for our long-term fleet . After all , as we 've learned , warts , wrinkles and cracks in the facade that may not be visible in the glow of a Southern California test jaunt become glaringly obvious in the harsh light of a daily joust in commuter traffic . We specified a Sedona EX , the better-equipped model of the line , with the optional equipment that most Sedona buyers will choose : power sliding side doors and rear hatch , as well as the rear-seat , headliner-mounted DVD player with two headphones-an essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list shows critically important items such as ABS , traction control and airbags for all . With third-row seats that fold flat into a floor well and second-row seats that can be removed by the strong , the Sedona has the necessities for moving people and stuff as needed . Time will tell with how much comfort and ease . - D.C. Nicely packaged with a lot of features and a great interior , Sedona represents heartland mirtivan . VITAL STATISTICS Base price : $25,595 As-tested price : $31,365 Extra-cost options : Power sliding doors and hatch , tri-zone automatic climate control , leather upholstery , heated front seats , power adjustable pedals , 13-speaker Infinity audio , rear-seat DVD Drivetrain : 3.8-liter DOHC 24-valve V6 engine , five-speed automatic , front drive Engine performance : 244 hp/253 lb. - ft . EPA fuel economy : 18 city/25 hwy second report INFINITI M35 Our M35 accumulated miles around Los Angeles-including a few runs to Las Vegas-with comfort and style . Then it served yeoman duty as the photo and support vehicle when we went coast to coast with a Corvette Z06 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of that prepared it for daily duty into and out of Manhattan . Within weeks of arriving here and being serviced , the lnfiniti and an NYC taxi had a minor altercation . No harm done to the cab , but we needed a new bumper cover and assorted bits for the M35 . Welcome to the Big Apple . Other than not being able to protect its space , the biggest problem for the M35 is its keyless ignition . We do n't like it . Once started , the car will run forever without the remote transmitter . It 's possible to take the idling M35 from our Manhattan parking garage and drive it 50 miles without noticing the dash warning light reminding us that the key fob is still in the parking attendant 's pocket . - D.C. The rosewood trim is elegant . But the analog clock is mounted too low to be more than pretty . DRIVERS NOTEBOOK * Loading CDs into the dashboard changer is awkward when the car 's in Park since the shift lever is so close to the dash . * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you lose concentration . Otherwise , it 's simply annoying . * The V6 shows plenty of muscle when asked to do so , while still delivering acceptable fuel economy . * The heaters in the front seats are more like seat warmers on cold mornings . They could use more juice . * Backup camera and swiveling front headlights are actually useful . DATA SO FAR As tested : $48,400 Previous reports : See 4/06 Miles driven : 15,482 Miles since last report : 12,957 Fuel economy : Average-21.8 mpg , Worst-17.4 mpg , Best-27.5 mpg Maintenance/ repair costs : Scheduled maintenance , $383 ; body repair , $1172 TOYOTA HIGHLANDER HYBRID This is the car those hybrid skeptics warned you about . Hybrids are supposed to be sleek and small , they say , not big and beefy . But now that we 've driven the Highlander for seven months , we think this just might be the future . Not everybody can squeeze their family and gear into a Prius . The Highlander has almost everything most people want from an SUV : room for seven ( if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive ( cleverly provided by an electric motor at the rear axle ) ; and cruising comfort . ( If you are looking for true off-road performance , look elsewhere . ) The combination of the V6 , two electric motors and CVT adds up to a surprisingly peppy ride . Lay down the throttle at any speed and you can feel the torque kick in . This is a hybrid for the real world . - JIM MEIGS DRIVERS NOTEBOOK * The integration of electric and gas power is virtually seamless . ( It 's so smooth that we find ourselves staring way too much at the little readout showing gas/electric status. ) * Interior styling is a little dowdy for such a high-tech vehicle . * Climate controls are annoyingly complex ; even turning down the fan requires punching several buttons . * We love it when the gas engine goes silent at stoplights . DATA SO FAR As tested : $42,054 Previous reports : See 4/06 Miles driven : 20,266 Miles since last report : 19,314 Fuel economy : Average-23.6 rnpg , Worst-19.9 mpg , Best-26.4 mpg Maintenance/repair costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CRD To our ears diesel clatter is orchestral . We 'd just need an air horn to complete that bigrig fantasy . And thanks to its five-speed automatic and 2wd capability , the Liberty can top 400 miles per 20-gal. tankful , depending on the amount of highway driving . Take that , you hybrids . Thanks to its instant-heat glow plugs , there 's no problem with cold starts . Plus , only full-throttle launches leave any wisp of smoke . Triumphantly , after weeks in the shop , Jeep 's factory techs shut off the Check Engine warning light by replacing the throttle body ( misnamed because diesels do n't need a throttle plate ) under warranty . - KEN JURAN DRIVERS NOTEBOOK * Love the audio controls on the back of the steering wheel spokes. * Parking brake already needed an adjustment at less than 15,000 miles . Huh ? * Spare tire on rear door does n't rattle and is n't as annoying as you might think . * Yes , this little truck has a big Class III towing-hitch receiver . DATA SO FAR As tested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16,552 Miles since last report : 3827 Fuel economy : Average-20.3 mpg , Worst-13.5 mpg , Best-27.3 mpg Maintenance/repair costs : None CHEVROLET COBALT SS We 've developed a love/not-quite-hate relationship with the SS . Love the supercharged four-banger with its musclecar-embarrassing power . The tranny slices through the gears like a formula car . Fuel economy is substantial-better than that of many wheezy econocars . But we ca n't deal with the suspension . Full throttle in bottom gear always results in stupendous wheel hop from the right front corner . Even with the tires pumped up hard , the line through fast sweepers is a little vague . And you do n't dare leave the tires hard-the springs are so stiff , a manhole cover will make the suspension bottom out . If we were going to modify this car , we 'd change the shocks , springs , and antiroll bars . Otherwise , as we near our next scheduled service , our tenure in the Cobalt has been uneventful. - MIKE ALLEN DRIVERS NOTEBOOK * Twenty-somethings recognize the SS as a hot ride . * Forty-somethings dismiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trunk sits in the rearview mirror at precisely the spot to hide state police cars behind you .
