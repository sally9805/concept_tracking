Ahab 's Wife Or , The Star-gazer : A NovelCaptain Ahab was neither my first husband nor my last . Yet , looking up -- into the clouds -- I conjure him there : his gray-white hair ; his gathered brow ; and the zaggy mark ; I saw it when lying with him by candlelight and , also , taking our bliss on the sunny moor among curly-cup gumweed and lamb 's ear . I see a zaggy shadow in the rifting clouds . That mark started like lightning at Ahab 's temple and ran not all the way to his heel ( as some thought ) but ended at Ahab 's heart . That pull of cloud -- tapered and blunt at one end and frayed at the other -- seems the cottony representation of his ivory leg . But I will not see him all dismembered and scattered in heaven 's blue -- that would be no kind , reconstructive vision ; no , intact , lofty and sailing , though his shape is changeable . Yesterday , when I tilted my face to the sky , I imaged not the full figure but only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me over his shoulder . What weather is in Ahab 's face ? For me , now , as it ever was in life , at least when he was looking at me alone and had no other person in view , his visage is mild -- with a brightness in it , even be it a wild , white , blown-about brightness . Now , as I look at those billowed clouds , I see the Pequod . I half-raise my hand to bid good-bye , as it was that last day from the east-most edge of Nantucket Island , when , with a wave and then a steadfast , longing look , till the sails were only a white dot , and then a blankness of ocean -- then -- a glitter --  I wished his ship and him Godspeed . Nantucket ! The home where first I found my body , my feet not so much being pulled into this sandy beach as seeking downward , toes better than roots ; then , my mind , built not to chart this blue swell of heaving ocean , but the night sky , where the stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spin in fiery passions of their own ; Nantucket !  - -  home , finally , of my soul , found on a platform eight-by-eight , the wooden widow 's walk perched like a pulpit atop my house . These three gears of myself -- body , mind , and soul -- mesh here on this small island -- Nantucket ! Then , why , when I look into the mild , day sky , do the clouds scramble , like letters in the alphabet , and spell not Nantucket , but that first home , Kentucky ? And those clouds that did bulge with the image of Ahab show me the map of that state , flat across the bottom and all billowed at the top ? I did not consult Ahab about my decision to spend my pregnancy in a rough Kentucky cabin with my mother , instead of staying in the gracious home of a captain 's wife on Nantucket . But I wrote him , of course , and sent the letter after him on the ship called the Dove , so he could imagine me aright . That time spent with my mother outdoors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by our indoor companionship of sewing baby smocks and cooking and reading again those great works of literature my mother had brought with her to the wilderness , green-bound books I had read as a child or she had read to me . Sometimes my mother and I stood and looked at our faces together in the oval mirror she had brought with her from the East . Along with her library chest of books , the mirror with its many-stepped molding distinguished our frontier cabin from others . Thus , elegantly framed , my mother and I made a double portrait of ourselves for memory , by looking in the mirror . When in early December the labor began but tried in vain to progress , my mother went from our cabin , driving the old mare in the black buggy through a six-inch crust of snow , for the doctor . In my travail , I scarcely noticed her leaving . When my mother did not come home and did not come home , and the pains were near unbearable and the chill was creeping across the cabin floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feather bed from my bunk and flung it atop her bed . In desperation , between spasms , I gathered all the gaudy quilts in the house , and then leaving the latchstring out so that I would not have to venture from my nest when she returned , I took to my childbirth bed . There , softness of two mattresses comforted me from beneath and warmth of myriad quilts , a cacophony of colors , warmed me from above , but still I worked my feet and legs and twisted my back . Despite the heat of my labor , I could feel my nose turning to ice , long and sharp as a church steeple all glazed with frost . Parsnip ! I thought of ; frozen and funny -- a vegetable on my face ! I chortled and then prayed , wondering if prayer and laughter gurgled up , sometime , from the same spring . Let nose be parsnip , parsnip be steeple , steeple be nose-whatever that protuberance , it is frozen to the very cartilage . Warm it ! Save me , gods and saints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about in antic dance , circling one picture after another . Nose ! Steeple ! Parsnip ! My desperate , laughing prayer from within that quilted hump below its parsnip was only that I should be delivered and nothing at all for the welfare of the rest of the world . I wanted to wait for my mother 's return and I was afraid because I had little idea of how to catch the baby . So even as I prayed , I prayed against myself , that time would not pass nor take me any closer to the port of motherhood . I thought of Ahab , as if his ship were wallowing , going neither forward nor drifting back but immobile in a confused sea . Ahab 's Wife
