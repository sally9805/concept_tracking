Chapter One Moscow swam in color . Hazy floodlights of Red Square mixed with the neon of casinos in Revolution Square . Light wormed its way from the underground mall in the Manezh . Spotlights crowned new towers of glass and polished stone , each tower capped by a spire . Gilded domes still floated around the Garden Ring , but all night earthmovers tore at the old city and dug widening pools of light to raise a modern , vertical Moscow more like Houston or Dubai . It was a Moscow that Pasha Ivanov had helped to create , a shifting landscape of tectonic plates and lava flows and fatal missteps . Senior Investigator Arkady Renko leaned out a window the better to see Ivanov on the pavement ten floors below . Ivanov was dead but not particularly bloody , arms and legs at odd angles . Two black Mercedeses were at the curb , Ivanov 's car and an SUV for his bodyguards . It sometimes seemed to Arkady that every successful businessman and Mafia hood in Moscow had been issued two Nazi-black Mercedeses . Ivanov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the safest apartment in Moscow and at 9:48 p.m. plunged to the sidewalk . Arkady had measured Ivanov 's distance from the building . Homicides generally hit close , having expended their energy in trying not to fall . Suicides were single-minded and landed farther out . Ivanov had almost reached the street . Behind Arkady , Prosecutor Zurin had brought drinks from the wet bar to a NoviRus senior vice president named Timofeyev and a young blonde in the living room . Zurin was as fussy as a maitre d ' ; he had survived six Kremlin regimes by recognizing his best customers and smoothing out their problems . Timofeyev had the shakes and the girl was drunk . Arkady thought the gathering was a little like a party where the host had suddenly and inexplicably dived through the window . After the shock the guests carried on . The odd man out was Bobby Hoffman , Ivanov 's American assistant . Although he was worth millions of dollars , his loafers were split , his fingers were smudged with ink and his suede jacket was worn to a shine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NoviRus . An assistant to a dead man ? That did n't sound promising . Hoffman joined Arkady at the window . " Why are there plastic bags around Pasha 's hands ? " " I was looking for signs of resistance , maybe cuts on the fingers . " " Resistance ? Like a fight ? " Prosecutor Zurin rocked forward on the sofa . " There is no investigation . We do not investigate suicides . There are no signs of violence in the apartment . Ivanov came up alone . He left alone . That , my friends , is a suicide in spades . " The girl lifted a dazed expression . Arkady had learned from the file he had on Pasha Ivanov that Rina Shevchenko was his personal interior designer , a twenty-year-old in a red leather pantsuit and high-heeled boots . Timofeyev was known as a robust sportsman , but he could have been his father , he had shrunk so much within his suit . " Suicides are a personal tragedy . It 's enough to suffer the death of a friend . Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying back . " He added to Arkady , " Ozhogin wants nothing done until he arrives . " Arkady said , " We do n't leave a body on the sidewalk like a rug , even for the colonel . " " Pay no attention to Investigator Renko , " Zurin said . " He 's the office fanatic . He 's like a narcotics dog ; he sniffs every bag . " There wo n't be much left to sniff here , Arkady thought . Just out of curiosity , he wondered if he could protect the bloody prints on the windowsill . Timofeyev pressed a handkerchief against his nose . Arkady saw spots of red . " Nosebleed ? " asked Zurin . " Summer cold , " said Timofeyev . Opposite Ivanov 's apartment was a dark office building . A man walked out of the lobby , waved to Arkady and gave a thumbs-down . " One of your men ? " Hoffman asked . " A detective , in case someone over there was working late and might have witnessed something . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prosecutor says . " " So you think it was suicide . " " We prefer suicides . Suicides do n't demand work or drive up the crime rate . " It also occurred to Arkady that suicides did n't expose the incompetence of investigators and militia who were better at sorting out dead drunks from the living than solving murders committed with any amount of forethought . Zurin said , " You will excuse Renko , he thinks all of Moscow is a crime scene . The problem is that the press will sensationalize the death of someone as eminent as Pasha Ivanov . " In which case , better the suicide of an unbalanced financier than assassination , Arkady thought . Timofeyev might lament the suicide of his friend , but a murder investigation could place the entire NoviRus company under a cloud , especially from the perspective of foreign partners and investors who already felt that doing business in Russia was a dip in murky water . Since Zurin had ordered Arkady 's financial investigation of Ivanov , this U-turn had to be executed with dispatch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but more a skillful sailor who knew when to tack . " Who had access to this apartment ? " Arkady asked . " Pasha was the only one allowed on this level . The security was the best in the world , " Zurin said . " Best in the world , " Timofeyev agreed . Zurin said , " The entire building is covered by surveillance cameras , inside and out , with monitors that are watched not only at the reception desk here but , as a safeguard , also by technicians at the headquarters of NoviRus Security . The other apartments have keys . Ivanov had a keypad with a code known only to him . He also had a lock-out button by the elevator , to keep out the world when he was in . He had all the security a man could wish for . " Arkady had been in the lobby and seen the monitors tucked into a round rosewood desk . Each small screen was split in four . The receptionist also had a white phone with two outside lines and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The building staff does n't have Ivanov 's code ? " Arkady asked . " No . Only the central office at NoviRus . " " Who had access to the code there ? " " No one . It was sealed , until tonight . " According to the prosecutor , Ivanov had ordered that no one enter the apartment but him - not staff , not a housecleaner , not a plumber . Anyone who tried would appear on monitors and on tape , and the staff had seen nothing . Ivanov did his own cleaning . Gave the elevator man the trash , laundry , dry cleaning , lists for food or whatever , which would be waiting in the lobby when Ivanov returned . Zurin made it sound like many talents . " Eccentric , " Arkady said . " He could afford to be eccentric . Churchill wandered around his castle naked . " " Pasha was n't crazy , " Rina said . " What was he ? " Arkady rephrased the question . " How would you describe him ? " " He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe he had a bad reaction to medication . " Timofeyev said , " I wish Ozhogin were here . " Arkady had seen a glossy magazine cover with a confident Lev Timofeyev sailing a yacht in the Black Sea , carving through the waves . Where was that Timofeyev ? Arkady wondered . An ambulance rolled discreetly to the curb . The detective crossed the street with a camera and shot flash pictures of Ivanov being rolled into the body bag and of the stain on the pavement . Something had been concealed under Ivanov 's body . From Arkady 's distance it looked like a drinking glass . The detective took a picture of that , too . Hoffman watched Arkady as much as the scene below . " Is it true , you treat Moscow like a crime scene ? " " Force of habit . " The living room would have been a forensic technician 's dream : white leather sofa and chairs , limestone floor and linen walls , glass ashtray and coffee table , all excellent backgrounds for hair , lipstick , fingerprints , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dust and search before Zurin genially invited in a crowd and tainted the goods . Because with a jumper , there were two questions : was he alone , and was he pushed ? Timofeyev said to no one in particular , " Pasha and I go far back . We studied and did research together at the institute when the country suffered its economic collapse . Imagine , the greatest physics laboratory in Moscow , and we worked without pay . The director , Academician Gerasimov , turned off the heat in the buildings to save money , and of course , it was winter and the pipes froze . We had a thousand liters of radioactive water to discharge , so we sent it into the river in the center of the city . " He drained his glass . " The director was a brilliant man , but you would sometimes find him inside a bottle . On those occasions he relied on Pasha and me . Anyway , we dumped radioactive water in the middle of Moscow , and no one knew . " Arkady was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took Timofeyev 's glass to the bar , where she paused by a gallery of photographs in which Pasha Ivanov was not dead . Ivanov was not a handsome individual , but a big man full of grand gestures . In different pictures he rappelled off cliffs , trekked the Urals , kayaked through white water . He embraced Yeltsin and Clinton and the senior Bush . He beamed at Putin , who , as usual , seemed to suck on a sour tooth . He cradled a miniature dachshund like a baby . Ivanov partied with opera tenors and rock stars , and even when he bowed to the Orthodox patriarch , a brash confidence shone through . Other New Russians fell by the wayside : shot , bankrupted or exiled by the state . Pasha not only flourished , he was known as a public-spirited man , and when construction funds for the Church of the Redeemer ran low , Ivanov provided the gold foil for the dome . When Arkady first opened a file on Ivanov , he was told that if Ivanov was charged with breaking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone and have the law rewritten . Trying to indict Ivanov was like trying to hold on to a snake that kept shedding skin after skin and grew legs in the meantime . In other words , Pasha Ivanov was both a man of his time and a stage in evolution . Arkady noticed a barely perceptible glitter on the windowsill , scattered grains of crystals so familiar he could not resist pressing his forefinger to pick them up and taste them . Salt . " I 'm going to look around , " he said . " But you 're not investigating , " Hoffman said . " Absolutely not . " " A word alone , " Zurin said . He led Arkady into the hall . " Renko , we had an investigation into Ivanov and NoviRus , but a case against a suicide does n't smell good in anybody 's nostrils . " " You initiated the investigation . " " And I 'm ending it . The last thing I want is for people to get the idea that we hounded Pasha Ivanov to death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grave . It makes us look vindictive , like fanatics , which we are n't . " The prosecutor searched Arkady 's eyes . " When you 've had your little look around here , go to your office and collect all the Ivanov and NoviRus files and leave them by my office . Do it tonight . And stop using the phrase ' New Russian ' when you refer to crime . We 're all New Russians , are n't we ? " " I 'm trying . " Ivanov 's apartment took up the entire tenth floor . There were n't many rooms , but they were spacious and commanded a wraparound view of the city that gave the illusion of walking on air . Arkady began at a bedroom upholstered in linen wall panels , laid with a Persian rug . The photographs here were more personal : Ivanov skiing with Rina , sailing with Rina , in scuba-diving gear with Rina . She had huge eyes and a Slavic shelf of cheekbones . In each picture a breeze lifted her golden hair ; she was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ages , for Ivanov their relationship must have been a bit like making a mistress of a leggy girl , a Lolita . That was who she reminded Arkady of - Lolita was a Russian creation , after all ! There was a nearly paternal humor in Pasha 's expression and a candy-sweet flavor to Rina 's smile . A rosy nude , a Modigliani , hung on the wall . On the night table were an ashtray of Lalique glass and a Hermes alarm clock ; in the drawer was a 9mm pistol , a Viking with a fat clip of seventeen rounds , but not a whiff of ever having been fired . An attache case on the bed held a single Bally shoe sack and a mobile-phone charger cord . On the bookshelf was a decorator 's selection of worn leather-bound collections of Pushkin , Rilke and Chekhov , and a box that held a trio of Patek , Cartier and Rolex watches and gently agitated them to keep them running , a definite necessity for the dead . The only off note was dirty laundry piled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a limestone floor , gold-plated fixtures on a step-in spa , heated bars for robes large enough for polar bears and the convenience of a toilet phone . A shaving mirror magnified the lines of Arkady 's face . A medicine cabinet held - besides the usual toiletries - bottles of Viagra , sleeping pills , Prozac . Arkady noted a Dr. Novotny 's name on each prescription . He did n't see any antibiotics for infection . The kitchen looked both new and forgotten , with gleaming steel appliances , enameled pots without a single smudge and burners with not one spot of crusted sauce . A silvery rack held dusty , expensive wines , no doubt selected by an expert . Yet the dishwasher was stacked with unwashed dishes , just as the bed had been loosely made and the bathroom towels hung awry , the signs of a man caring for himself . A restaurant-size refrigerator was a cold vault , empty except for bottles of mineral water , odds and ends of cheese , crackers and half a loaf of sliced bread . Vodka sat in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business dinners every day . He was , until recently , a famously sociable man , not a wealthy recluse with long hair and fingernails . He would have wanted to show his friends a shining up-to-date kitchen and offer them a decent Bordeaux or a chilled shot of vodka . Yet he had n't shown anyone anything , not for months . In the dining room Arkady laid his cheek on the rosewood table and looked down its length . Dusty , but not a scratch . At the twist of a rheostat , the next room turned into a home theater with a flat screen a good two meters wide , speakers in matte black and eight swivel chairs in red velvet with individual gooseneck lamps . All New Russians had home theaters , as if they were auteurs on the side . Arkady flipped through a video library ranging from Eisenstein to Jackie Chan . There was no tape in the tape player , and nothing in the mini-fridge but splits of Moet . Continues ...             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
