" Ally McBeal " ' s Courtney Thorne-Smith on elves , boobs and pecan balls // Courtney Thorne-Smith plays Georgia , the nice-girl foil to Calista Flockhart 's erratic Ally on the Emmy-winning " Ally McBeal . " Most recently , she 's become a spokesmodel for Almay cosmetics . We chatted with her on a break during an ... um ... uniquely strenuous episode . Shape : With your outrageously unpredictable shooting schedule , nailing down an interview with you was not easy . How do you find time to work out ? Courtney Thorne-Smith : Some weeks I 'm hardly in the show , so that gives me time . But the last couple of episodes have been ... Shape : ... lots of Georgia ? T-S : Exactly Plus we do things they do n't do on other shows . The other day it said in the script : " Fight with elves . " Shape : OK That is a tad unusual . T-S : Yes , and you really do n't know how long a scene like that is going to take . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Can we consider it exercise ? T-S : Oh , yeah . I was exhausted . And I had bruises all over my back afterward . Photograph // Shape : Presumably you also do non-elf-related workouts . Otherwise , perhaps we 'd better stop the interview right here . T-S : I get up early - 5:30 - and do an hour of running or the StairMaster nearly every day . Twice a week I do Pilates . I love the Ali MacGraw yoga tape and Kathy Smith 's " Yoga Challenge . " Plus , I meditate every morning , which is more powerful than anything in helping me have perspective throughout my day . Shape : Are you one of those people who get grumpy if they do n't exercise ? T-S : Very grumpy and very sluggish . I 'm lucky I 'm not one of those people who has to drag herself to the gym , but a few years ago I got so stressed I started exercising too much . Shape : Precisely how far off the deep end did you go ? T-S : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hey , five miles feels good , eight must feel better ! But after a while I did n't have any energy . I needed to eat more and run less . And I gave up the fantasy of having thin arms . Shape : Actually , your arms look very good . T-S : Yeah , but for years I really wanted thin , thin arms . Finally , I looked at my mother and sister and went , " This is my genetics . I have boobs but not thin arms . " In fact , I spent years debating whether to get a boob reduction . Shape : Get out of here ! So what else does this neurotic inner voice say ? We all have those voices that say stupid things . T-S : Mine complains because I will never have a perfectly flat tummy or breasts that look wonderful in a tank top without a bra . I will never wear spaghetti straps successfully . The grass is always greener , right ? We need to just relax and be kinder to ourselves . Shape : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that runs on narcissism and cosmetic surgery . T-S : And competition , unfortunately Shape : Is there competition on the set ? T-S : Yes and no . As long as I 'm honest , there 's camaraderie . For example , I 'll be feeling self-critical , but if I walk into the makeup trailer and say , " I 'm feeling crazy because of this and this , " every woman in there goes , " Yeah , me too ! " When we talk about what 's really going on , it opens the door for other women and we 're reminded that we 're all in the same boat . Like at awards shows , which are supposed to be so glamorous , if one person says , " I 'm uncomfortable in my dress , " seven others say , " if I have to hold my stomach in for one more minute , I 'm gon na die ! " Shape : What have you learned from your character , Georgia ? T-S : Patience . People say , " She should dump Billy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost by waiting a day . I 've applied that to my own life . I can be furious at my boyfriend , Andy genetic scientist Andrew Conrad , but if I wait 24 hours before I go into my tirade , it 's gone . Shape : " Wait 24 hours . " That 'd make a good refrigerator magnet . Other than elf fights , what other interesting things have you done on the show ? T-S : Well , Calista and I always say our favorite show is the " sperm episode . " That 's when we had to go into a prison and bring back the prisoner 's , you know , in a cup , to impregnate his wife . Also , the episode where I got to sing , badly . And kickboxing with Calista . I love doing the stunts . Shape : You once said you were miserable in high school because you were n't popular . I guess you showed those snotty girls ! T-S : The deal is , you only get popular when you no longer care . Shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : What 's your eating regimen ? T-S : What works best for me is healthy eating and very little sugar I can turn fruitoholic in no time flat because sugar sets up a craving in me that is not pretty . My whole family is a bunch of sugar wackos . All my grandma wanted before she died was pecan and praline balls . Shape : On the other hand , maybe at a certain age one has earned the right to eat what one pleases . T-S : You 're right . Okay , that 's what I 'm gon na do . I 'll be really healthy " til I 'm 85 or 90 , then eat nothing but pecan balls .
