At five p.m. precisely , Black Elvis began to get ready . First , he laid out his clothes , the dark suit , the white dress shirt , the two-tone oxfords . In the bathroom , he used a depilatory powder to remove the stubble from his face , then carefully brushed his teeth and gargled with Lavoris . He applied a light coating of makeup , used a liner to deepen the effect of his eyes . They were big eyes , the color of old ivory , and examining them in the mirror , he had to remind himself once again whose they were . <p> At the bus stop , his guitar precariously stowed in a chipboard case held together by a bungee cord , he was watched by two shirtless boys on a stoop , drinking sodas . Their young , dark torsos emerged out of enormous dungarees like shoots sprouting . <p> " Yo , " one of them called . " Let me see that , " <p> Black Elvis stayed where he was , but tightened his grip on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sun hung low in the sky , turning the fronts of the rowhouses golden red . <p> " Are you a Muslim , brother ? " asked the smaller of the two . His hair was cornrowed , and one eye peered unnaturally to the side . <p> Black Elvis shook his head . He wondered how hot it still was . Eighty , at least . <p> " He 's a preacher , " said the other one . " Look at him . " This boy , though larger , gave the impression of being less sure of himself . <p> His sneakers were untied and looked expensive and new . <p> " Singing for Jesus , is that right ? " <p> " No , " said Black Elvis . <p> " For who , then ? " said the smaller one . <p> " For an audience , my man . I have a gig . " He knew this boy . Sometimes he drew pictures on the sidewalk with colored chalk . <p> " Yeah ? " The boy trained his one useful eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three feet to the left . <p> " Go on and play something , then . " <p> " I 'm a professional . No professional going to play songs at no bus stop . " <p> " When the bus come ? " <p> Black Elvis examined his watch . " Anytime now . " <p> " You got time . Play us something . " <p> " Was I talking to this here lamppost ? Black Elvis do n't play no bus stops . " <p> " Black what ? " said the bigger of the two boys . <p> " Elvis . " <p> " Dude is tripping out . " <p> " Yo , Black Elvis . Why do n't you help us out with a couple of dollars ? Me and my boy here , we need to get some things at the store . " <p> He considered . He had bus fare and another eight dollars on top of that , which he intended to use for beer at Slab 's . In case of emergency , there was the ten-dollar bill in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pocket and pulled out two ones . <p> " All right , then , " he said , and handed them the money . <p> The smaller one leaned very close as he took it . He was about the same size as Black Elvis , and he smelled strongly of underarm . <p> " You crazier than shit , ai n't you ? " <p> " You take that two dollars , " Black Elvis said calmly as the bus pulled in , " go on over to Kroger 's , and get yourself some Right Guard . " <p> At Slab 's , the smell of grilled meat permeated the walls and the painted windows that advertised ribs , beer , and live music , and extended well out into the parking lot . The dinner rush had already started , and there was a good-sized line of people waiting to place orders . Larry was working the register , grizzled white stubble standing out against his nut-brown skin , grease flames shooting up from the grill behind him as slabs and half slabs were tossed onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked like he was manning it . <p> Butch , who ran the blues jam , was at his usual front table near the stage , finishing a plate of ribs , beans , and slaw . " Black Elvis , ' he said , with enthusiasm . He wiped his mouth with a napkin , then smoothed his goatee . His pink face glistened with a thin layer of sweat . " What is up ? " <p> " Oh , you know , same old , same old . You got me ? " <p> " I got you , man , do n't worry . " He tapped a legal pad with one thick finger . " Would n't be the blues jam without Black Elvis ! <p> " I know that 's right . " <p> " You heard about Juanita ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Oh , man . She died last night . In her sleep . Put in her regular shift , just sassing people like she always did , you know . Did n't seem like anything was wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bad ticker . She was a little overweight . ' <p> " She was , at that . " He thought about Juanita 's huge butt and breasts , how she more waddled than walked . But dead ? How could that be ? <p> " Yeah , it 's a sad thing " said Butch . " Kind of makes you realize how fragile it all is , for all of us . " <p> He watched as the drummer hauled the house snare drum out from the women 's bathroom , where it was stored , up next to the stage . The wall behind the stage was painted to look like Stone Mountain , but instead of Confederate generals , the faces looking down at the crowd were those of B. B. King , Muddy Waters , Robert Johnson , and someone else who Black Elvis could never be quite sure about . Whoever had done the painting was n't much of an artist . <p> " Hey , you want a beer ? " Butch poured the remainder of the pitcher on the table into what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , on the house . " <p> Black Elvis picked up a napkin and ran it carefully around the rim of the glass . " Thanks , " he said . <p> He found himself a seat next to a table of rich white folks who had been to some movie and were arguing about whether the actress in it had had her breasts enlarged . It had been a long time since Black Elvis had been to the movies , although he sometimes watched the ones they had running back in the video department of the Kroger 's where he cut meat . They mostly looked the same to him , flickering postage stamps of color . They ought never to have gone to color , he thought . A picture ought to be in black and white . He remembered going to a picture with his father years ago that had pirates in it and Errol Flynn . His father would n't buy him popcorn , said it was a waste of money . He must have been about eight . The war was over . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and suddenly his daddy was pressing a hard-boiled egg into his hand and saying , " Go on , boy , take it " He ate the egg , shucking it carefully into his hand and placing the shells into the pocket of his shirt , while all around him he smelled the popcorn he really wanted . <p> He looked up . They 'd asked him something , but he could not be sure what . <p> " Napkins ? " <p> He pushed the dispenser toward them . He 'd drifted someplace , it seemed . He took a swallow of beer . He needed something inside him , that was all-some weight to keep him from floating away . He was Black Elvis . He had a show to put on . <p> He 'd been doing the jam now for four years . Everyone knew him . They relied on him . Sometimes he changed his repertoire around a little bit , threw in I Ca n't Help Falling in Love " or something else unusual-he had a version of " You Were Always on My Mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most part he was a Sun Sessions man . " That 's All Right " for an opener . " Hound Dog . " " All Shook Up . ' " Milkcow Blues . " If there was a band , he 'd play with them-he liked that-but it did n't matter , he could do his songs by himself , too . He twisted his lip , stuck out his hip , winked at the ladies . Two years ago , the Creative Loafing had done an article on Slabs , and his picture appeared next to it , almost as if his face were an addition to the mural , and he kept this taped to the wall next to his bed . <p> There were moments he 'd tucked away in his mind the way people keep photos in their wallets , ones that stood out from the succession of nights of cigarette and pork-grease smell , of cold beers and loud music . The time he 'd explained to a fine young blond-haired girl , whose boyfriend had come down to show off his rock and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I 'd rather see you dead , little girl , than to be with another man . " in " Baby , Let 's Play House , " and not the Beatles , and the way she 'd looked at him then and said , " You mean they stole it ? " and he smiled and said , " That 's exactly what I mean . " Or the time a young white man in a suit gave him a fifty-dollar tip and said , " You 're the best dang thing I 've seen in this whole dang town , and I been here one year exactly come Friday . " <p> He should have been the first one called . That was usual . That was the way things went on blues jam night . But that was n't what happened . Instead , Butch played a few songs to open- " Let the Good Times Roll " and " Messin ' with the Kid " - then stepped to the microphone and looked right past Black Elvis . <p> " We got a real treat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all give it up for Mr. Robert Johnson . I 'm serious now , that 's his real name . Give him a nice hand ! <p> From somewhere in the back , a person in an old-fashionedlooking suit and fedora worked his way up through the crowded restaurant , holding a black guitar case up high in front of him . Trailing out from the back of the hat was a straight black ponytail . When he reached the stage he opened the case and took out an antique guitar . He turned around and settled into a chair , pulling the boom mike down and into place for him to sing , while Butch arranged another mike for the instrument . Black Elvis just stared . <p> The man was Chinese . <p> " Glad to be here " said Robert Johnson . " I only been in Atlanta a week , but I can tell I 'm going to like it a lot already . " He grinned a big , friendly grin . His voice sounded Southern . " Just moved here from Memphis , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Man , where am I gon na get me some decent ribs in this town ? " ' He plucked at the guitar , made a kind of waterfall of notes tumble out of it . " I can tell I 'm going to be putting on some weight around here . ' There was laughter from the crowd . <p> Black Elvis drank some more beer and listened carefully as Robert Johnson began to play the Delta blues . He was good , this boy . Probably spent years listening to the original recordings , working them out note for note . Either that , or he had a book . Some of those books had it like that , exact translations . But that was n't important . What was important was on the inside . You had to feel the music . That just did n't seem likely with a Chinese man , even one that came from Memphis . <p> He did " Terraplane Blues . " He did " Sweet Home Chicago " and " Stones in My Pathway . " He played " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and opiate creeping through his blood , turning harder and colder as it did so . On the one hand , it should have been him up there , making the crowd love him . But the more he watched , the more he was convinced that he simply could not go on after Robert Johnson . With his pawn shop guitar and clumsy playing , he 'd just look like a fool . <p> He watched Butch 's face and saw the enjoyment there . He 'd never seen the crowd at Slab 's be so quiet or attentive to a performer . Robert Johnson did feel the music , even if he was Chinese . It was strange . Black Elvis glanced toward the front door and wondered if there were any way at all he might slip unnoticed through the crowded tables and out . <p> When Robert Johnson finished his set , people applauded for what seemed like hours . He stood and bowed , antique guitar tucked under one arm . Black Elvis felt he was watching the future , and it was one that did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You could n't let yourself fall into that . He 'd seen it happen to other people his age , the shadows who walked around his neighborhood , vacant-eyed , waiting to die . Esther , who lived in 2C , just below him , who watched television with the volume all the way up and only opened the door once a week for the woman from Catholic Social Services to come deliver her groceries . That woman had stopped up to see Black Elvis , but he 'd sent her away . Ai n't no Catholic , he 'd said . That 's not really necessary , she told him . So he told her he carried his own groceries , and got a discount on them , too . And as she was leaving he asked her if she knew what God was , and when she did n't answer , he told her : " The invention of an animal that knows he 's going to die . " <p> They were talking to him again , those people at the next table . He shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a bird these days . <p> " You 're up , ' they told him . " They want you . " <p> He brought his guitar up onto the stage . Robert Johnson had taken a seat with Butch , and they were talking intently about something . Butch had out a datebook and was writing in it . Butch also booked the music for Slab 's on the other nights , the ones where the performers got paid . Robert Johnson 's Chinese eyes squinted tight as pistachio nuts when he smiled . <p> " Black Elvis , " someone shouted . He heard laughter . <p> " I 'm going to do something a little different , " he said into the microphone . " A good person passed last night . Some of you probably heard about it by now . Juanita- " He struggled to find her last name , then heard himself say " Williams , " which he was certain was wrong , but was the only name he could come up with . " Juanita was , you know , family for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So I 'd like to dedicate this song to Juanita . This one for you , baby . " <p> He played a chord and was not surprised when his fourth string snapped like an angry snake striking . Ignoring this , he began to sing . <p> ' Amazing grace , how sweet the sound ... " <p> He did n't know if the next chord should be the same , or different , so he just played E again . It was n't right , but it was n't that wrong . <p> " That saved a wretch like me ... " <p> He remembered his mother singing this . He could see her on the porch , stroking his sister Mae 's head , sitting in the red metal chair with the flaking paint , the smell of chicken cooking in the kitchen flowing out through the patched window screen . His own voice sounded to him like something he was hearing at a great distance . <p> " I once was lost , but now I 'm found ... " <p> The people were staring at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was watching , the fires continuing to dance behind him . <p> " Was blind , but now I see . " <p> He lowered his head and hit a few more chords . He felt like he was in church , leading a congregation . He looked up , then nodded somberly and went back to his chair . <p> " That was beautiful , man , " said Butch , coming over to him . " Just fucking beautiful . ' <p> Robert Johnson offered to buy him a beer . <p> " All right , " said Black Elvis . " Molson 's . " <p> " Molson 's , it is . ' He was gone a few minutes , then returned with a pitcher and two glasses . I like a beer with flavor , " he said . " Microbrews and such . " <p> I like beer that 's cold , " said Black Elvis . I like it even better if it 's free . " <p> Hard to argue with that , my man . " He filled the glasses . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Black Elvis stared at him . <p> " Juanita ? " <p> " That 's right . Tragedy . They say she had a bad ticker . She was a little overweight , now . " He thought again about her . She 'd had a lot of facial hair , he remembered that . And she used to wear this chef 's hat . <p> " This is a nice place , " said Robert Johnson , looking around . The next group was setting up on stage . " Real homey . " <p> " This is the best place for ribs and blues in Atlanta . Do n't let no one tell you different . " He peered at Robert Johnson 's round , white face . " So , you from Memphis , buh ? " <p> " That 's right . " <p> " Memphis , China ? " <p> Robert Johnson laughed . " I 'm Korean , not Chinese . Well , my parents are . I was born here . But I 've always loved black music . I grew up around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of guitar that is you play ? " <p> " Martin . 1924 00-28 Herringbone . I wish I could tell you I found it in an attic or something , but it 's not that good a story . I paid a lot for it . But it 's got a nice sound , and it fits with the whole Robert Johnson act , you know ? " He adjusted his tie . " I 've learned that it 's not enough to just be good at what you do , you have to have a marketing angle , too . ' <p> " Marketing , you say . " <p> " I 've got me a gig here already for next weekend . ' <p> He was quiet for a moment . " You been to Graceland ? " <p> " Graceland ! Well , of course I 've been to Graceland . Everyone in Memphis has been to Graceland . ' <p> " What 's it like ? " <p> " What 's it like ? " He gave a silver ring on his middle finger a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels like holy ground , but at the same time , you also feel like you 're at an amusement park . The Jungle Room is pretty cool , I guess . ' <p> " Sun Studios ? " <p> " They have tours , but I 've never done one . If you 're so interested , you ought to go . " <p> " You think so ? " <p> " Sure . Why not ? " <p> " You got connections there ? Like who could get me a gig ? " <p> Robert Johnson considered this . Black Elvis realized that he 'd done exactly what he 'd wanted not to do , which was to put this person in a position where he had power over him . But he could n't get it out of his head that there was something about this meeting that was more than chance . He had a feeling Robert Johnson was someone he was supposed to meet , if only he could determine why . <p> I do n't think so . I mean , if you 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off just about anyplace but Memphis . Of course , that 's just my opinion . " <p> " I 'll bet they do n't have-no black-Elvises . " <p> " Are you kidding ? Black , Chinese , Irish , Jewish , you name it . You think fat white men in hairpieces have the market cornered on Elvis impersonation ? I know a place where they have a dwarf who sings ' Battle Hymn of the Republic ' every evening at ten while two strippers give each other a bath , right onstage . ' <p> For a moment , he imagined a big stage-an opera house-with hundreds of Elvises of all shapes and colors pushing and shoving each other to get to the front . The thought made him shiver . <p> " Do n't matter . I 'm an original . " <p> " No doubt . If you do n't mind my asking , what made you decide to start doing this ? " He looked at Black Elvis with admiration . " I love your hair , incidentally . I mean , if I looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time . You just have that natural blues man look . You could be John Lee Hooker 's cousin or something . " <p> " I do n't care much for blues music , " said Black Elvis . He sniffed . " Never have . " <p> " Really ? " <p> I like that rock and roll . " <p> " Well , whatever makes you happy . " Robert Johnson made a move to get up . <p> " No , wait , " said Black Elvis , suddenly anxious . " Tell me something . Is that what you think ? Have I gotten it wrong all this time ? Should I be doing something else ? You play good , you sing good , you know about marketing . Just tell me , and I 'll listen . I do n't have that much time left . " <p> Robert Johnson stood up and adjusted his fedora . He looked slightly embarrassed , " I got ta go talk to a young woman over there " he said . " She 's been staring at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you understand . " He picked up a napkin and held it out . " You got a little nosebleed going . ' <p> Black Elvis took the napkin and held it tight against his nose . <p> When he got home , Juanita was waiting for him in the living room , wearing her chef 's hat and a stained serving apron , her wide body taking up half the sofa . <p> " You late , " she said . " Did you have a good time ? " <p> " Good time ? " he said . He thought about this . He did n't really go to the blues jam for a good time . He went because it gave him a purpose , a place to be , and because by now it just seemed that if he did n't go , all hell might break loose . The sun might not come up in the morning . " I sang you a song , ' he said . <p> " That right ? What you sing ? One of them Elvis songs ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's nice . You 've got blood on your shirt , you know . " <p> " Mmmm-hmmmm . ' " He pulled up a chair and sat opposite her . He had not turned on any lights , and her figure was shadowy and evanescent , like a glimpse of a fish below the surface of a fast stream . " You supposed to be dead , now . " <p> " Supposed to be . " <p> " Bad ticker , huh ? " <p> " Just stopped on me . " <p> " Hurt ? " <p> " Shit yes . For a second it felt like someone hit me in the chest with a sledgehammer . Now , tell me the truth , how come you singing songs for me ? You know I do n't care for you much at all . I 'd have thought the feeling was mutual . " <p> " Let me turn on a light . " <p> " Do n't do that . I like it better in the dark . Come on , now , what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes for a moment . " There was a man there , a Chinese man . He took my spot . " <p> " And so you go all churchy ? You just nothing but a hypocrite . Just a big old faker . " <p> " I do n't believe in you , ' said Black Elvis . " And I 'm turning on the light . " <p> " I do n't believe in you , either , " said Juanita . " Go ahead . " <p> He cut on the light , and she was gone , as he 'd suspected she would be . From the street below , he heard shouting and laughter . He went over to the window and pulled back the curtains just far enough to see . <p> The two boys he 'd seen earlier were out in the middle of the street . One had a spray can of paint and was walking slowly back and forth , while the other , the bigger one , watched and occasionally shouted encouragement . At first , he could n't tell what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come together and he realized that it was him the boy was painting , Black Elvis , spraypainted twenty feet high down the center of the street . He watched in amazement as the details took shape , his pompadour , the serious eyes , sideburns , pouting lips . <p> " Believe in me , " he said . " Stupid woman . " <p>
