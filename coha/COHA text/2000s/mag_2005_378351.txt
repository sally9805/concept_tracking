Bloggers are all the rage , but some tipping point of self-absorption may have been reached with BLOGEBRITY , a new site toasting the blogosphere 's in crowd . The site 's two twentysomething founders have created an A list of blogging stars ( like WONKETTE 'S Ana Marie Cox and Jason Kottke of KOTTKE.ORG ) , followed by hundreds of B and C listers . A post later lamented that blogging has lost its hip factor , but Blogebrity 's founders are just getting going . Next up : plans for a print magazine and TV program featuring inside dish on bloggers . The A listers , anyway .
