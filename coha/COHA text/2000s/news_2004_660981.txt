<p> They 're hip . Influential . Out there . By one estimate , there are 2 million of them posted on the Internet around the world talking about everything from knitting patterns to the war in Iraq . But as blogs - or personal weblogs - move into the limelight , they 're also coming under closer scrutiny . And the conclusions are in some ways sobering . <p> Except for a tiny number of blogs that have gained prominence , all this techno-chattiness remains just that : an immature form of communication that has yet to gain traction with the general public , experts say . Most are moldering in cyberspace , updated only sporadically or abandoned completely . But out of this fervid experimentation are coming some new forms of communication that are already influencing public discourse . <p> Take politics . David Winer says weblogs are going to play a huge role in politics . But all the buzz about politicians using them is overblown . The blog of Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean was just a " gimmick , " says Mr. Winer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Society at Harvard Law School and a pioneer blogger . And any blogs produced this year by President Bush or John Kerry will be " basically run by the ad agencies " - not the kind of honest , even intimate conversations that blogs can represent . <p> Here 's his vision of how real " blogging " by a politician could work . A candidate for city council , for example , would write an ongoing blog to his potential constituents explaining his positions on issues . They could read his pitch and offer feedback , creating a kind of political dialogue that would be " based on substance more than sound bites , " he says . <p> Visionaries such as Winer hope that this is the emerging world of blogs , a place where serious and substantial ideas can be shared . This Saturday he 'll host BloggerCon II , a conference at Harvard Law School for both new and veteran bloggers . <p> In keeping with the egalitarian nature of blogs , no expert panels will speak : Moderators will encourage everyone to share ideas . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the future of politics , academia , business - and especially journalism . ( " Are we journalists ? " some bloggers ask . ) <p> Blog reporters ? <p> Although many of the most popular bloggers discuss politics and other news events , few observers say they believe blogs will replace conventional print journalism anytime soon . Instead , they say , blogs are becoming another place where news-hungry readers can go . <p> " Weblogs are good at providing timely information , " says Rebecca Blood , author of " The Weblog Handbook " and a veteran blogger . " The form of a blog itself is ' new entry on top , new entry on top , new entry on top . ' " But that does n't provide the kind of story " weighting " that a newspaper or magazine provides , she says , when it arranges stories according to their importance , using headlines and placement on the page as signals . <p> Bloggers should be seen more as commentators and aggregators rather than reporters , Ms. Blood says , though " sometimes you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " One valuable thing a blogger often does is hyperlink to magazine and newspaper stories or other interesting blogs , she says . " But 99 percent of the weblogs being done could not by any stretch of the imagination be considered journalism , " she says . " I most emphatically do n't consider myself a journalist ... I always link to news stories that I find and then add my commentary . That 's not news gathering . That 's not reporting . " <p> The form has come a long way from where it started in the late 1990s . That 's when a few computer-literate Internet users who knew how to write software code began to share their opinions , blog-style , with anyone online who discovered them . In 1999 software arrived that made it easy for anyone to create a blog . Soon the stereotype of a blogger became a teenage girl writing in her online diary , obsessed with her own world . <p> Now that the model has given way to a version of Chairman Mao 's " let a thousand flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tech talk and political raves - people who may have heard of blogs but never read one are left scratching their heads , unsure what they 're all about . <p> " When you try to draw a circle around blogs and say what they are , you always come up with exceptions , " Winer concedes . <p> The website technorati.com says it is tracking 2.1 million blogs . <p> Bloggers who write from exotic locations , such as war-torn Iraq or secretive North Korea , or give juicy insider views of Washington politics , have given blogs a cachet . They 've attracted the attention of mainstream journalists , who in turn write about them . And though blogs represent only a tiny portion of the content on the Internet , they 've grown large enough to carve out their own niche , the so-called blogo-sphere . <p> " It is an important phenomenon happening on the Web , " says Amanda Lenhart , the principal author of a recent survey that asked Americans about blogs and was conducted by the Pew Internet &; American Life Project in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Americans have created blogs and about 11 percent of Americans have read at least one . " It is not a large number in the grand scheme of the Internet , " Ms. Lenhart says . Nevertheless , she says , that 's 4 million to 9 million people , not an insignificant number . <p> The survey also found that most bloggers do n't update their blogs very often - once a week or less . Only about 10 percent make a new entry at least daily . That dovetails with a study last October , conducted by Perseus Development Corporation , that estimated 4.12 million blogs were online ( more than half written by teens ) but also noted that two-thirds of them had not been updated within the previous two months , meaning they had been either temporarily or permanently abandoned . <p> Perseus projected that the number of blogs would exceed 10 million by the end of 2004 , and compared the makeup of the blogosphere to an iceberg . <p> " An iceberg is constantly dissolving into seawater , and the majority of blogs started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote Jeffrey Henning , chief operating officer of Perseus , in the report . " Right now , though , this iceberg is moving so quickly into Arctic waters that it is gaining mass faster than it is losing it . The key is that an iceberg is never what it appears , and so it is with today 's blogging community . " <p> As more people read and write blogs , their influence will keep growing , online observers say . More and more people will look to them to find out the buzz of the day . Politicians will find it important to know what blogs say about them . And smart companies will begin to pick up on what 's being blogged about them , says John Palfrey , executive director at Harvard Law School 's Berkman Center . Right now , that 's mostly true only of tech firms , who might follow what 's being said about a hot product like Apple 's iTunes player , which downloads music from the Internet . <p> " On the one hand , it 's a very , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And on the other hand , it 's a very , very powerful technology in terms of what you can use it for , " Mr. Palfrey adds in a phone conversation . Bloggers do n't even need their own website : They can go to places such as blogger.com , typepad.com , or livejournal.com and tap out their musings for little or no cost . <p> Career booster <p> Although making a living just blogging is nearly impossible , a blog can have a great deal of career value by demonstrating one 's expertise and writing skills , thus serving as a " reputation builder , " Blood says by phone from San Francisco . " You can quickly establish yourself as an expert in your field by becoming a kind of one-stop source for information . " <p> And while existing software has made blogs cheap and easy , Blood predicts that the limitations of the form will drive bloggers into other forms of publishing . <p> " Once we have easy-to-use tools for other kinds of publications , like ezines online magazines , or even tools that allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll see those kinds of publications explode as well , " she says . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 .
