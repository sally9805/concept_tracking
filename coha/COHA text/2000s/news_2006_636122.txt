<p> On first glance , rock ' n ' roll music is n't very conservative . It does n't fare much better on second or third glance ( or listen ) , either . Neil Young has a new song called " Let 's Impeach the President . " Last year , the Rolling Stones made news with " Sweet Neo Con , " another anti-Bush ditty . <p> But some rock songs really are conservative  --  and there are more of them than you might think . Last year , I asked readers of National Review Online to nominate conservative rock songs . Hundreds of suggestions poured in . I 've sifted through them all , downloaded scores of mp3s , and puzzled over a lot of lyrics . What follows is a list of the 50 greatest conservative rock songs of all time , as determined by me and a few others . <p> What makes a great conservative rock song ? The lyrics must convey a conservative idea or sentiment , such as skepticism of government or support for traditional values . And , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 're biased in favor of songs that are already popular , but have tossed in a few little-known gems . In several cases , the musicians are outspoken liberals . Others are notorious libertines . For the purposes of this list , however , we do n't hold any of this against them . Finally , it would have been easy to include half a dozen songs by both the Kinks and Rush , but we 've made an effort to cast a wide net . Who ever said diversity is n't a conservative principle ? <p> So here are National Review 's top 50 conservative rock songs of all time . Go ahead and quibble with the rankings , complain about what we put on . In the end , though , we hope you 'll admit that it 's a pretty cool playlist for your iPod . <p> 1 . " Wo n't Get Fooled Again , " by the Who . The conservative movement is full of disillusioned revolutionaries ; this could be their theme song , an oath that swears off naive idealism once and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any different to me/And the slogans are replaced , by-the-bye . . . . Meet the new boss/Same as the old boss . " <p> 2 . " Taxman , " by the Beatles . A George Harrison masterpiece with a famous guitar riff : " If you drive a car , I 'll tax the street/If you try to sit , I 'll tax your seat/If you get too cold , I 'll tax the heat/If you take a walk , I 'll tax your feet . " The song closes with a humorous jab at death taxes : " Now my advice for those who die/Declare the pennies on your eyes . " <p> 3 . " Sympathy for the Devil , " by the Rolling Stones . The devil is a tempter who leans hard on moral relativism  --  he will try to make you think that " every cop is a criminal/And all the sinners saints . " What 's more , he is the sinister inspiration for the cruelties of Bolshevism : " I stuck around St. Petersburg/When I saw it was a time for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> 4 . " Sweet Home Alabama , " by Lynyrd Skynyrd . A tribute to the region of America that liberals love to loathe , taking a shot at Neil Young 's Canadian arrogance along the way : " A Southern man do n't need him around anyhow . " <p> 5 . " Would n't It Be Nice , " by the Beach Boys . Pro-abstinence and pro-marriage : " Maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray it might come true/Baby then there would n't be a single thing we could n't do/We could be married/And then we 'd be happy . " <p> 6 . " Gloria , " by U2 . Just because a rock song is about faith does n't mean that it 's conservative . But what about a rock song that 's about faith and whose chorus is in Latin ? That 's beautifully reactionary : " Gloria/In te domine/Gloria/Exultate . " <p> 7 . " Revolution , " by the Beatles . " You say you want a revolution/Well you know/We all want to change the world . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " What 's more , Communism is n't even cool : " If you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao/You ai n't going to make it with anyone anyhow . " <p> 8 . " Bodies , " by the Sex Pistols . Violent and vulgar , but also a searing anti-abortion anthem by the quintessential punk band : " It 's not an animal/It 's an abortion . " <p> 9 . " Do n't Tread on Me , " by Metallica . A head-banging tribute to the doctrine of peace through strength , written in response to the first Gulf War : " So be it/Threaten no more/To secure peace is to prepare for war . " <p> 10. " 20th Century Man , " by the Kinks . " You keep all your smart modern writers/Give me William Shakespeare/You keep all your smart modern painters/I 'll take Rembrandt , Titian , da Vinci and Gainsborough . . . . I was born in a welfare state/Ruled by bureaucracy/Controlled by civil servants/And people dressed in gray/ Got no privacy got no liberty/'Cause the 20th-century people/Took it all away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " by Rush . Before there was Rush Limbaugh , there was Rush , a Canadian band whose lyrics are often libertarian . What happens in a forest when equal rights become equal outcomes ? " The trees are all kept equal/By hatchet , axe and saw . " <p> 12 . " Neighborhood Bully , " by Bob Dylan . A pro-Israel song released in 1983 , two years after the bombing of Iraq 's nuclear reactor , this ironic number could be a theme song for the Bush Doctrine : " He destroyed a bomb factory , nobody was glad/The bombs were meant for him/He was supposed to feel bad/He 's the neighborhood bully . " <p> 13 . " My City Was Gone , " by the Pretenders . Virtually every conservative knows the bass line , which supplies the theme music for Limbaugh 's radio show . But the lyrics also display a Jane Jacobs sensibility against central planning and a conservative 's dissatisfaction with rapid change : " I went back to Ohio/But my pretty countryside/Had been paved down the middle/By a government that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Right Now , " by Jesus Jones . The words are vague , but they 're also about the fall of Communism and the end of the Cold War : " I was alive and I waited for this . . . . Watching the world wake up from history . " <p> 15 .

A eulogy for family values by an alt-rock band whose members were raised in a generation without enough of them : " So here 's your holiday/ Hope you enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's not right . " <p> 18 . " Cult of Personality , " by Living Colour . A hard-rocking critique of state power , whacking Mussolini , Stalin and even JFK : " I exploit you , still you love me/I tell you one and one makes three/ I 'm the cult of personality . " <p> 19 . " Kicks , " by Paul Revere and the Raiders . An anti-drug song that is also anti-utopian : " Well , you think you 're gon na find yourself a little piece of paradise/But it ai n't happened yet , so girl you better think twice . " <p> 20 . " Rock the Casbah , " by the Clash . After 9/11 , American radio stations were urged not to play this 1982 song , one of the biggest hits by a seminal punk band , because it was seen as too provocative . Meanwhile , British Forces Broadcasting Service ( the radio station for British troops serving in Iraq ) has said that this is one of its most requested tunes . <p> 21 . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love song about a man and a woman divided by the Berlin Wall . No moral equivalence here : " I can remember/ Standing/By the wall/And the guns/Shot above our heads/And we kissed/As though nothing could fall/And the shame/Was on the other side/Oh we can beat them/For ever and ever . " <p> 22 . " Red Barchetta , " by Rush . In a time of " the Motor Law , " presumably legislated by green extremists , the singer describes family reunion and the thrill of driving a fast car  --  an act that is his " weekly crime . " <p> 23 . " Brick , " by Ben Folds Five . Written from the perspective of a man who takes his young girlfriend to an abortion clinic , this song describes the emotional scars of " reproductive freedom " : " Now she 's feeling more alone/Than she ever has before . . . . As weeks went by/It showed that she was not fine . " <p> 24 . " Der Kommissar , " by After the Fire . On the misery of East German life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in town , uh-oh/He 's got the power/And you 're so weak/And your frustration/Will not let you speak . " Also a hit song for Falco , who wrote it . <p> 25 . " The Battle of Evermore , " by Led Zeppelin . For a song released in 1971 , it 's hard to miss the Cold War metaphor : " The tyrant 's face is red . " <p> 26 . " Capitalism , " by Oingo Boingo . " There 's nothing wrong with Capitalism/There 's nothing wrong with free enterprise . . . . You 're just a middle class , socialist brat/From a suburban family and you never really had to work .

" <p> 29 . " Rime of the Ancient Mariner , " by Iron Maiden . A heavy-metal classic inspired by a literary classic . How many other rock songs quote directly from Samuel Taylor Coleridge ? <p> 30 . " You Ca n't Be Too Strong , " by Graham Parker .

" <p> 31 . " Small Town , " by John Mellencamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not forget where it is that I come from/I can not forget the people who love me . " <p> 32 .

" You Ca n't Always Get What You Want , " by the Rolling Stones . You can go " down to the demonstration " and vent your frustration , but you must understand that there 's no such thing as a perfect society  --  there are merely decent and free ones . <p> 34 .

Here 's a sampling : <p> The choice of " Wo n't Get Fooled Again " was inevitable . The critical mythology of neo-conservatives is that they were once idealistic leftists and totally cool and could so get laid and knew where to buy the best weed but the tawdry stupidity of liberal beliefs ran them off . The seedy reality is that the only known human being to actually make the legitimate case that this is his life story is P.J. O'Rourke . The rest of them were just Marxists who ran off to be right wingers when they realized the American left was n't ever going to embrace Stalinist authoritarianism . All attempts to claim the mantle of pseudo-cool rebellion must be viewed in this light . <p> Amanda Marcotte , pandagon.net <p> - - - <p> On the choice of " Revolution " by the Beatles : <p> The Lads were pretty liberal even by the standards of 1960s-era twentysomethings . They were just also anti-violent and anti-Communist . So , incidentally , was George McGovern . <p> James Joyner , Outsidethebeltway.com <p> - - - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ songs by Creedence , the Pretenders or the Clash as right-leaning . ( Criticizing the left from even further left does n't make you conservative . ) It also takes a tin ear for context and irony . <p> Many of the songs on this list are neither strictly liberal nor strictly conservative but politically ambiguous or ambivalent , and they 're all the richer for not being politically doctrinaire . <p> Where 's Ted Nugent on this list ? Where 's Charlie Daniels ? <p> And where is the most conservative popular genre of our time , gangsta rap ? Here are songs that glorify self-reliance , entrepreneurship , gun rights and very old-fashioned patriarchal gender roles . Hook the kids on " All About the Benjamins " or " Get Rich or Die Tryin ' " today , and they 'll be espousing the economic theories of Milton Friedman tomorrow . <p> Gary Susman , popwatch.ew.com <p> - - - <p> Quoting from Samuel Coleridge makes you conservative ? What the hell ? <p> Jaime , popwatch.ew.com <p> - - - <p> On the choice of " My City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were railing against what has become lately the Wal-marting of America , which is what conservatives want to achieve . That is so liberal it 's beyond the right 's understanding . <p> Charlotte , popwatch.ew.com <p> " Top 50 Conservative Rock Songs " is like proclaiming the top 50 liberals in the NRA , or maybe the top 50 cool Republicans . The National Review 's list confuses the reactionary fantasies of the right ( who want to return to the supposed , and nonexistent , good old days ) with the reaction of rock to the hypocritical , mean-spirited , inhumane and just plain no-fun ways of the conservative world vision . It really makes the head hurt to once again see the right wing attempting to co-opt something like rock music , which is so thoroughly against much of what the right claims to stand for , i.e. , regression into the bad old days , no sex , no drugs , and the truth be known  --  no fun . <p> Winston Smith , rawstory.com <p> - - - <p> Wonderful use of ellipses here : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " You say you want a revolution/Well you know/We all want to change the world . . . Do n't you know you can count me out ? " <p> Now consider the actual lyrics : <p> " You say you want a revolution/Well you know/We all want to change the world. /You tell me that it 's evolution/Well you know/We all want to change the world. /But when you talk about destruction/Do n't you know you can count me out ? " <p> Chloe , msgboard.snopes.com <p> - - - <p> The Pretenders " My City was Gone " was n't about central planning ; it was about out-of-control development and urban sprawl . Unless I somehow missed Ohio being a communist state in the early 1980s . <p> Lainie , msgboard.snopes.com <p> - - - <p> " Wo n't Get Fooled Again " is not an unconditionally anti-war song , or a song for or against revolution . It actually questions the heart of democracy : we vote heartily for leaders who we subsequently always seem to find wanting . <p> Pete Townshend of the Who ( who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again " was an absolute gim me . For God 's sake , Townshend shoved a guitar up Abby Hoffman at Woodstock when the Yippie tried blathering during the Who 's set . Pete hated hippies , period , as any self-respecting Mod was obligated to do . When we were " philosofizen " in a haze back in the day , I always told the idiots around me , " it means nothing 's gon na change , we 're all doomed , so just pass me the doob .
