Introduction // Investing well is n't easy , but it is possible . My goal in life is to make it easier for you to make money . I want to help out regular people with paying a mortgage , or college tuition , or hey , if we really do well , maybe buying a boat . Picking the right stocks is one of the hardest parts of investing , and every night on Mad Money , I try to take some of that burden off your shoulders . If you watch the show , I can give you good stocks . I can help you understand where the market 's going . My last book , Jim Cramer 's Real Money : Sane Investing in an Insane World , gave you the disciplines and insights I had developed over the course of my long career as a money manager . Since I wrote Real Money , it 's gotten harder to be a regular investor . We live in a more dynamic , more economically integrated world , and that means it takes more effort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this book , I 'll show you how you can best use Mad Money to make money in this new , more complex global economy , and I 'll also teach you the many new lessons about investing that I 've learned from putting the show together every weekday for more than a year . I hope Mad Money , and this Mad Money book , can give you a life that 's richer in wealth if not necessarily in spirit . // But if you think just watching Mad Money alone can make you rich , you 're dead wrong . If you think that watching the show and maybe doing a little research on the side can make you money , I 'd bet you 're off the mark there too . It 's not enough just to process what I say on the show . You need to know what to do with it . And that , my friends , is what this book is all about . // I want to help you take the advice I give out on Mad Money and show you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket . That 's what I 'm all about : helping everybody get rich . There 's a method you need to use , there are protocols to follow . Sometimes you 'll need a translator to understand what I 'm saying on the show , because I get a little caught up with the idea of being on TV and start making lots of incomprehensible references to things only a few hundred people have ever heard of . But if you watch the show , and if you use this book to turn my advice on the show into real investment strategies , I think you 'll be able to make yourself some serious dough . I do n't want to knock the show  --  it 's fun to watch  --  but there 's more to investing than I can convey in an hour a night of TV , especially when I have to keep from being too didactic in order to hold everybody 's attention . // This book is about maximizing what you can do with the market advice I freely distribute on the show  --  advice that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and playing to win . This book is the necessary complement to Mad Money , and the even more necessary sequel to Jim Cramer 's Real Money : Sane Investing in an Insane World . In Real Money I wanted to help individual investors make money in the stock market . I wrote that book before I had Mad Money , and in the last year and a half , things have changed . I learned more in the first year of making my show than I learned in any five years I spent running my hedge fund . Now I 've got a new approach to stocks . It 's pretty simple : there 's no such thing as the market . Whenever people talk about " the market , " they 're really talking about a very small group of large institutions : hedge funds and mutual funds . Because these funds control so much of the money in the market , they 're the ones who determine stock prices . A stock is only worth what the big institutions are willing to pay for it . Mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the individual investor , understand what these big players are doing and to help you try to beat them at their own game . In this book , I 'll tell you how to make the best use of my show in light of my new philosophy , and I 'll teach you the important new lessons I 've learned since I wrote Real Money . The market 's changed ; my new rules will help you capitalize on my most recent experience with stocks , and they 'll help you deal with a stock market that 's gotten harder . // Now , sometimes I 've got to toot my own horn just so you guys will listen to me . I have a few talents : I am a pretty good stock picker and a successful investor . Just so you do n't think I 'm conceited , I 'm also not the most considerate guy on earth , and I 'm a bad sport when playing Monopoly . The point is , I know how to make money in the market , and I want to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not doing it to be famous , and I 'm not doing it for the pay , because I 've already got more money than I feel comfortable having , and I say that as an incredibly greedy capitalist . I need to make you rich . I do n't know why , maybe it 's out of a pervasive sense of guilt , maybe I 'm a nice guy  --  it does n't matter . You will need more than just Mad Money if you 're going to make the money I want you to make . // Originally , back at the end of 2004 when we first started throwing ideas together to make the show , I had a plan . There are a lot of people out there who need reliable , honest advice about stocks . You ca n't be sure about research from this or that brokerage house . They 've all been tarnished ; they 've been tarred and feathered and ridden out of town on a rail for colluding with their clients . And business journalism has the same problem as every other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expresses an opinion , or even evaluates the validity of the press releases they get . No one ever puts his neck in doctor guillotine . Instead , they present these bland pseudo-analyses that in the end tell you nothing . Reporters want to tell you the news . You ca n't make a dime off the news unless you know what to do with it , and that 's why Mad Money was born . I wanted to do something different and more helpful . // My goal is to create hundreds of thousands , maybe millions of people who diligently invest their money in stocks and come out of it with some mad money . I happen to think my TV show is great . I think it 's the best thing on TV short of 24 , The Shield , and most of what 's on HBO . Good as I think it is , you need more . You need a supplement , you need something that lets you convert what I give you on the show into money in your pocket , and that 's why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all comes together . I may play a total madman on TV , but I 'm really just a very unbalanced guy at home . However , when it comes to stocks , I believe in being rigorous and methodical , not crazy . There 's no madness to my method . If you want to watch Mad Money and then turn around and make yourself a fortune , you have to understand that method . You have to know what to watch for  --  which observations are significant and which ones aren't. // That 's the way this book will make you money . The great thing about Mad Money is that it 's an up-to-the-minute show . Real Money , my last book , has great general advice about the strategies you should be using to make money in the market , but it has no up-to-the-minute , immediate component . What you 're getting in this book is a way to take the detailed , immediate recommendations and observations from the show and turn them into money in your pocket . // I want this book to guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend every single night on the show . I do n't just hand you money on a silver platter . I wish I could . I wish it grew on trees , but it takes hard work to make money . I think I 'm giving great advice on the show , but you still have to do your homework if you 're going to turn that advice into the one thing we 're after : money . So in this book , I 'll tell you how to do the homework and how to decide which stocks are for you and which stocks you should stay away from , given your age or your personality . I want to guide you through the process of purchasing the stocks you like and then deciding when , where , and how to sell those stocks . I never have time to get into this sort of thing on the show , but it 's just as important to know how to buy and sell the right stocks as it is to know how to pick them . I want to take some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the show and break them down for you , because knowing how to decode genuine Wall Street gibberish , and genuine Cramer gibberish , will improve your game . // I 'm writing this book because I want you to feel like you 've got me sitting right next to you , guiding you every step of the way when you buy and sell the stocks I pick on the show , or when you just try to implement my more general advice . But I want to do more with this handbook than just teach you how to follow my marching orders . Just as I do on the show , I want to educate you . Making Mad Money has been an education for me , and I have twenty new rules for investing , rules that I 've formulated by rigorously analyzing my successes and failures . These rules explain how to invest in a market where the big hedge funds and mutual funds run the show . They 're new disciplines that will let you anticipate the behavior of the big institutions . If you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not repudiating my rules in Real Money  --  they 're still valid  --  but the world has changed . My twenty new rules are a supplement to my Real Money rules , not a substitute for them . // That 's not all . If you want to get the most out of Mad Money , you need to understand how I operate . Every night I take dozens of calls in the " Lightning Round , " a segment where callers ask me what I think about their stocks . I do n't know what the stocks will be beforehand , but I still manage to give out decent advice . In this book , I 'll show you exactly how I can tell people whether to buy or sell something with only five or ten seconds to think about the stock . I 'm revealing all the secrets of the " Lightning Round " and all the tricks I use to pull it off every night . Not only that , I 'll even show you how to do your own Lightning Round  --  not in order to impress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good Lightning Round may be the best way for you to sharpen your stock-picking and investment skills . It 's stock market strength training . // Almost every night , I interview a different CEO or CFO on the show . A lot of people tune out for those interviews because they do n't think they can get anything out of them . In this book , I 'll tell you exactly how to watch my CEO interviews because they 're an incredibly useful asset  --  but they 're an asset you have to learn how to exploit . // I know that many people want to game the show . You want to be able to figure out what I 'm going to say before I say it , because the show moves stocks . You want a trick that will let you read my mind so you can buy stocks before I recommend them . I 'll tell you straight out : there is no trick . There 's no real way to game the show . But you can learn how to think like me . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the show . You 'll get a glimpse of my thought process as I try to put together good picks that I think will make you money . If you know how I pick stocks for the show , you probably still wo n't be able to anticipate Mad Money 's recommendations . But you will learn how I decide which stocks to feature , and that 's not a bad thing to know . // I may be a good stock picker , but I 'll admit that I 'm not the most polished broadcaster on earth , and sometimes I can be , let 's say , incomprehensible . That 's why I 'm giving you a guide to all the weird terms I use and some of the esoteric , even obnoxious cultural references I make . Can this stuff make you money ? If you think hard enough , probably . But the real point is that it makes watching the show more fun , and if watching the show is fun , then investing will be fun . As long as you enjoy investing , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game . That 's why I try to make the show so entertaining , because if you are n't interested , you 'll either miss the opportunity to make money in the market or not pay enough attention and end up losing your shirt . // And in the interest of keeping things fun  --  because again , where there 's no fun , there 's wo n't be any money ( hey , the reverse is true too )  --  I 've got a glossary that explains all my props and , even better , my sound effects and what they 're supposed to mean . I want you to know what you should do when I push a given button . It 's a science : it 's Cramerology. // At the end of the book , I give you a stock worksheet that will help you keep track of all the steps you need to take if you want to own a stock . The worksheet is a template , a way to organize your thoughts so that you can follow the instructions I lay out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocks . You do n't have to use the worksheet , but if it helps even just a little bit , then why not ? // I 'll try anything to help make you wealthier than you are  --  you know that if you 've ever seen the show . I just ca n't stop myself ; I 'm addicted to making you money . I should be spending all day in a country club or never getting out of my pajamas like Hugh Hefner . But here I am , writing this Mad Money book , because I have a categorical imperative to help you get rich , and the show is not enough . I hope you enjoy it , and I hope it helps you get that house or that car . Or , let 's get really ambitious and try for the yacht . // Copyright ? 2006 by J. J. Cramer &amp; Co. // Chapter One : Buying a Stock Mad Money Style // Step One : Know Yourself and Your Goals // Let 's cut to the chase . I come out on my show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give it a big , triple-buy , I give you the whole shtick about why it 's great and why you should own it . What should your response be ? // Well , if you really want to get the most out of Mad Money , and I 'm not talking about literary value here , or even entertainment value , you need a pretty good understanding of who you are , where you are in your life , and what you 're after . I do n't want this to be a self-help book . The last thing in the world I want is to turn into the Dr. Phil of investment advice . But if you do n't know what your priorities are  --  and I can give you an idea of what they should be if you need help in that department  --  then trying to invest will be a lot harder than it should be , and Mad Money , for all its virtues , wo n't help you at all . // When I recommend a stock on Mad Money , I do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own that stock . And even if I did have time , the legal department at CNBC has some problems with my giving out individualized investment advice . That 's why I 'm devoting some space in this book to helping you figure out what kind of investor you want to be . That way , when you watch the show , you can have a perspective that will not only help you make money , but , beyond that , will let you measure your own successes and failures . Let me give you a quick example . If I tell you to buy a stock that I believe will double over the next eighteen months , and you really just want to make some quick trades that will give you smaller but quicker gains , you should n't buy that stock . You wo n't get what you 're after , and when you do n't get what you 're after , I get angry e-mails . So let 's do our best right now to set you up for success at whatever it is you 're trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Money , but there are different ways to do it , and Mad Money does n't mean the same thing at twenty-five that it means at fifty or seventy-five . I want you to figure out where you 're coming from . Maybe you think this is intuitive , that you have a visceral sense of your goals and your financial position , but it pays to be careful . // A lot of people who are trying to make money in the market do n't have a sense of their own identity as investors . Some people think they do . I 've made this mistake countless times , which is why I 'm the guy to help make sure you do n't . Before you watch the show and try to take my advice , you need to ask yourself a set of questions , and I 'll lay them out right here . // First and foremost , how old are you ? If I come out on the show and recommend Conexant ( CNXT ) , which when I first came out in favor of it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television set-top boxes , I 'm not necessarily recommending the stock for you . As it happened , Conexant could have made some people a lot of money in a very short time . I got behind it on September 19 , 2005 , at a buck sixty-three a share , and four months later , on January 19 , it closed at three dollars and thirty-four cents a share . Now , even though I got that one right , that was not a stock that you should 've put any retirement savings into . It 's not a stock that I would recommend a sixty-year-old buy , unless he or she happens to have a whole lot of extra money to put on the table and risk losing . // Some of you are probably saying to yourselves , money is money . Why should it make any difference how old I am if stocks like Conexant can deliver that kind of return ? In most things I 'm an egalitarian . I think that in all the important , essential ways , people are the same . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some upsetting realities . We are not all financially equal . And not all stocks are equally risky . The young , I hate to admit at the ripe old age of fifty-one , are allowed to take a lot more risks with their money than the middle-aged or the elderly . And when it comes to money , this is the one place where it 's not smart to lie about your age , although to look youthful I often claim I am sixty-two years old on air . It 's not that young people are better at managing risk . The odds are good that if you 're a young investor , you do n't have the experience to manage risk as well as someone who 's a bit more seasoned . In a way , it 's ironic that young people , who have the least experience , also have the most latitude in how they can invest . It 's ironic , but as far as I 'm concerned , it 's also financial gospel . // Young people can take more risks with their money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you 've got more time to earn back your losses , you can afford to take bigger risks . A risky stock like Conexant is perfect for someone just out of college . You can count on me to give you honest and good advice , but I 'll get it wrong sometimes , and when I do , if you 're acting on my recommendations , it 's possible you 'll lose money . If I were in your shoes , I 'd rather lose money as a recent college grad , who has a whole career to earn it back , than as a retiree who 's depending on that income for rent , or medical bills , or food , or yacht fuel . That 's why , on my " Back to School " tour , I offer college kids some of the riskiest alternatives out there . That does n't mean you ca n't make money as you get older ; it just means you should pay more attention to my conservative stock picks and a lot less attention to the sexy-looking speculative ones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 'll determine the way you approach my show and the way you should approach the market . It 's a rude question , but making money can be a rude business . The second question , a two-parter , frankly is even more obnoxious : how much money do you have in the bank , and what 's your income ? I tell people never to put more than 20 percent of their discretionary money , which means the money that they 're not saving for retirement , into speculative stocks . Those are the risky stocks like Conexant that can deliver the big gains or the big losses . That 's a rule , and it 's one I 'm sticking to because I 'm a law-and-order kind of guy . But to be honest , if you 're really rich , if you 're raking in a lot of money , you can afford to speculate with half or even all of your investment income . I do n't recommend it . I do n't think it 's smart . You only need to get rich once . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledged : the richer you are , the less you need to worry about money . It 's obvious on a gut level , but no one likes to be told that they do n't make enough money to be taking real risks in the market . // It is a question of risk . Losing money means nothing to the really rich , so they can be more aggressive . The money you are investing is meant to increase your wealth , and it would be imprudent to take extra risk if you have less . // If you do n't have a lot of money to invest with and you 're approaching retirement , do n't put your money in risky stuff . I get behind risky stocks all the time on the show , but they 're meant only for people who have either the time or the money to be able to afford the risk . I want to make you rich , but I 've got my own Hippocratic oath , and the first step to making you rich is keeping you from becoming poor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even with very little money . But you have to use different strategies depending on how old you are and how much you 've got in the bank . In terms of how much money you should have if you want to start investing in stocks , I 've always said you should have ten thousand dollars that you can afford to put into stocks . That 's separate from retirement money . You can still make money with five thousand dollars , or even less than that , but once you get too low , even today 's small commissions will eat into your profits , and the amount of effort necessary to beat the market wo n't end up providing you with commensurate gains . // We 've gone over your age and your bank account  --  not fun subjects , not polite subjects , but even when it 's fun , making money is a serious game , no matter what kind of stunts I pull on my show . There are two more things you need to know about yourself before I 'll let you approach my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot less touchy . You need to know your temperament . There 's a certain level of calm that everyone needs to have to beat the market , but I 've yet to meet anyone who could n't relax enough to make money in stocks . You have to keep yourself distanced from the bad days , because sometimes you lose . Some people are just born more comfortable taking risks than others . Some of us are conservative , and despite how I act on the show , I 'm actually a pretty conservative investor . I do n't want you to lie to yourself here  --  and I know this sounds like New Age garbage , but please bear with me , because I promise this is something that can make you rich . A lot of people who invest feel pressure to take bigger risks than they 're comfortable taking ; we live in a culture that celebrates risk taking . We love cowboys , and even though there have n't been more than a couple of decent Westerns made in the last fifteen years , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it 's OK , when you watch my show , to write off all the speculative , under-ten-dollar , unprofitable , risky stocks I recommend if you do n't feel right about buying them . It 's OK to feel some trepidation at taking big risks , and if you are n't comfortable , you wo n't have fun if you do . When you do n't have fun , you are n't as motivated to do the work , and when you ai n't motivated , you ai n't making money . That 's half the point of my show . So please , I beg you , if you 're not a big risk taker , just forget about the speculative stocks . There 's nothing wrong with wanting to own big , solid , dividend-paying , stable companies . You can make of a lot of money that way , and you wo n't have to pull your hair out worrying about the risk . Let me tell you , at my hedge fund I would take risks that I did n't necessarily feel good about , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart , I 'd probably have a little more hair on my head today . // We 've got age , income , and personality . The last question , before I let you listen to my stock picks , is about your priorities . And this is pretty simple stuff . Are you in the game for the long haul , do you want stocks that are going to make you money in the next year , or are you after trades that will make you money in the next week ? I try to have something for everybody . Mad Money has been chock full of good trades , and I 've also given you some great investments  --  not to ignore the mistakes I 've made along the way . If you want to trade , you need more free time . I do n't believe in buying a stock and holding it  --  you know , if you 've seen the show , that you 've got ta do at least one hour of homework a week per stock you own . But if you really want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor intensive . The shorter your time horizons for making money , the more time and effort you must put into the homework . I know people have said that my show is for traders and not longer-term investors , but the truth is that Mad Money is most useful for people who do n't have a ton of free time to trade in . Again , I try to play Zero Mostel in A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum and have something for everyone , but if you 're day trading , look , Mad Money is only an hour of show a day , and it comes on after the close . That means I have a lot less to offer you . // I went over a risky , speculative stock already , Conexant , but there are three other classes of good stocks worth owning that I want to go over with you so that you can easily identify them on the show and pick out the ones that are right for you . The other three types of good stocks , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are stocks with high growth , stocks with consistent growth , and value stocks . On the show I will try to identify every single stock I recommend as falling into one of these categories . High-growth stocks , obviously , have high growth , but that 's not their only characteristic . These are the riskiest of the three types of nonspeculative stocks . As with almost everything involving money , more risk means more reward . High-growth stocks can make you a lot of money because the fund managers on Wall Street live for growth , and they adore any stock that can deliver really high growth . And by high growth , I 'm talking about any stock that 's growing its earnings at 20 percent or more annually . As long as these stocks keep delivering , they 'll make you money , but it 's not all milk and honey here . If a high-growth stock fails to deliver , if it disappoints the Street by reporting earnings that are a little shy of expectations or growth that 's a little lower than what the Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the case of great franchises like Starbucks or Whole Foods Market , they can bounce back . Sooner or later this happens to every high-growth stock , because a company can become only so big , and the bigger you are , the harder it is to grow . My sister 's father-in-law was a crop duster , and he 'd always say that there are two kinds of pilots : the ones who have crashed , and the ones who are going to crash . It 's no different with high-growth stocks . // Do n't get me wrong  --  with a little homework , you 'll be able to avoid getting seriously hurt in high-growth names . But they 're more risky than consistent growers or value stocks , and you need to take that into account when you 're trying to set up a portfolio that 's right for you . Because consistent growers are less risky , unsurprisingly , they do n't tend to make you as much money . But they have other good qualities that make up for the fact that they go up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PepsiCo ( PEP ) or General Mills ( GIS ) . Consistent growers pay out dividends . I love dividends . What could be better than having a company hand you money for doing nothing other than owning the stock ? I know , some of the daredevils out there will scoff  --  as I write this PepsiCo pays out a 2-percent dividend and General Mills a 2.7-percent dividend . It 's not a lot of money , I 'll admit . But if you 're aiming to make yourself a 7 to 10 percent gain in the market , which is beyond respectable for a conservative portfolio , or even a risky one , that dividend money will definitely help you get there . Consistent growers are very shareholder friendly : they do n't just pay dividends , they also tend to buy back stock . This helps you out in two ways . First , by decreasing the number of shares out there , these companies increase the earnings per share and make your shares more valuable . That 's the reason companies do buybacks . The second great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company the stock belongs to , buys large amounts of stock , the stock goes up because buybacks tighten supply . In a bad market where no one wants to buy stocks , having the company there with a buyback in place creates an automatic buyer and keeps the stock from getting hit too hard . You can think of it as a cushion or a parachute effect , and it will keep you from getting discouraged in a bad market . These stocks probably could n't have done anything for my hairline , but truth be told , I just shave my head because women seem to love it . // Value stocks are the third and most conservative kind of stock worth owning . All value stocks are cheap , but not all cheap stocks have value . Actually , let 's not call value stocks cheap . Value stocks are inexpensive ; they 're low priced . Bad stocks are cheap . With a good value stock , you 're getting great merchandise that 's been put on sale for bad reasons , not shoddy merchandise that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . On Mad Money , when I go for value , I usually do a pretty good job of separating the wheat from the chaff . Value stocks often pay high-yielding dividends , not because the companies have nothing to do with their cash , but because they 've gone so low that regular large-sized dividends turn into humongous ones . Not all value stocks pay dividends . Some are companies that , when you look at their underlying assets , are just priced way too low for bad reasons . I 'll tell you all about valuation later on ; right now I just want to give you a feel for the different breeds of stocks . Value stocks have usually come down for a reason , that reason being either something bad about the company or its sector or something irrational about the market . If you 're going to buy value stocks , you want to be sure that they 'll go up . Value investors have a longer time frame than growth investors , but it 's not an infinite time frame . On the show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain to you why they 're going to come up . And you 're not allowed to buy any stocks unless you can explain to a friend who knows nothing about the market why that stock is going higher . // A good example of a value stock  --  again , as I write this book ; it may not be a value stock when you read this  --  is Walter Industries ( WLT ) , which I talked about on Mad Money on June 23 , 2006 . At the time , Walter was a value stock because of the huge discrepancy between its value and the value of its underlying assets . Walter was a $2-billion company with a number of different businesses . It produced high-quality coal , the kind you use to make steel ; it had a home-building business ; and it also owned 85.5 million shares of a company called Mueller Water Products ( MWA ) . When I recommended Walter , that position in Mueller was worth $1.3 billion . That meant the market was valuing Walter 's coal and home-building businesses at just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walter became inexpensive because it had been beaten up during May 2006 , a really terrible month for stocks . But even before it fell to 48.39 , where it was when I recommended it , the stock was cheap . When I talked about Walter on the show , it was trading at less than nine times expected 2006 earnings , even though it was expected to have 20 percent growth going forward . It had a P/E of 8.8 and a PEG rate of just 0.44 . ( I 'll define these terms more thoroughly when I tell you about the homework you should do on a stock in just a little bit . ) Take my word for the moment , those two numbers made this stock inexpensive based on the value of its assets and its growth , and that 's what makes a great value stock , that 's what makes it a gift if it goes lower . // There 's no reason that you ca n't own speculative stocks , high-growth stocks , consistent-growth stocks , and value stocks all at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to own different kinds of stocks . But , depending on those variables we talked about before  --  age , wealth , personality  --  you 'll want to own different amounts of each kind of stock . If you 're conservative , you want more value , more consistent growth , and less high growth , with maybe no speculation at all . If you 're young and love to skydive , you 'll want to own a speculative name and high-growth stocks , but you still should have some consistent growers and value stocks , just not as much exposure as someone who 's more risk averse . // Now that you 've taken a good look at how old you are , how much money you have , what kind of temperament you 're saddled with , and what , given those three things , your investment goals are , you can get down to the business of watching Mad Money and trying to turn my advice into stock-market gold . If you know yourself , you 'll know which stocks are for you . But if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've pitched , then I 'd really appreciate it , and I think your wallet would appreciate it , too , if you followed my standard operating procedure for researching , buying , and then selling stocks . //
