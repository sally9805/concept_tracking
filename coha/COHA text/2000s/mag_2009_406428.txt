Peter and alex Matthiessen talk about continuity and change in their corner of Long Island . PHOTOGRAPHS BY WILLIAM ABRANOWICZ READERS OF Peter Matthiessen 's books of fiction and nonfiction would be challenged to say exactly where the author lives , although they 'd be right to assume it 's well outside a major city . Matthiessen has written from experience about tangles between man and nature on most of the world 's continents , from the Americas ( At Play in the Fields of the Lord ) and Africa ( The Tree Where Man Was Born ) to Asia ( The Snow Leopard ) and Antarctica ( End of the Earth ) . An adventurer , a master of observation and a shaper of sentences so cogent and pure that they come across as an awakening , he has won the National Book Award twice , most recently this past fall for his novel Shadow Country . In the early fifties , after a few years of living abroad , the Manhattan-born writer settled on eastern Long Island . " I had been visiting the South Fork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends here , " Matthiessen explains . " When I returned to the U.S. from Paris , in 1953 , I came back here to live , first in Springs , then in Amagansett ; I was at work then on my second novel Partisans and worked also as a commercial fisherman and charter-boat captain . Throughout this period , hunting and fishing with friends , I got to know Sagaponack , which in those days was the last real farming community on the East End . " In the summer of 1958 , when downtown Sagaponack was a one-room store , post office and gas pump all run by Mr. Lee Hildreth , I stayed with a girlfriend who had rented a small house on the main street  --  the only street . In the fall of 1959 came a chance to buy an island of wood , garden and pastureland with a rather decrepit house , stable and shack surrounded by potato fields a half mile back across farmland and salt pond from the ocean beach , all for what it might cost today to construct an outhouse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century as of this year . " Matthiessen wrote about his immediate surroundings in The Shorebirds of North America and Men 's Lives , the latter an account of waning local fishing traditions on the South Fork . Peter 's son Alex , the youngest of his four children , grew up in the Sagaponack house and now owns a place of his own in Sag Harbor , where he commutes on weekends from an apartment in New York City . Alex is an environmental activist , a former government-policy adviser and , since 2000 , the president of Riverkeeper , a nonprofit organization that works to safeguard the ecological integrity of the Hudson River . Founded as part of a grassroots antipollution campaign by a group of fishermen in 1966 , Riverkeeper has since then stopped thousands of environmental transgressions and won hundreds of millions of dollars in legal damages that have been used to remediate the river . The advocacy group 's success has encouraged similar watchdog efforts elsewhere in the U.S. and beyond . Each in his own way , Alex and Peter Matthiessen have become advocates for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to home on Long Island , they have seen the lands and waterways that once sustained wildlife and then a population of Native Americans , farmers and fishermen become a draw primarily for their beauty , with some unsavory consequences . In the process , they have witnessed the birth of a local conservation movement . Last summer , Town &; Country asked the Matthiessens to revisit some of the spots that have meaning for them in Sagaponack and elsewhere on the East End . The images on these pages , taken by photographer and environmentalist William Abranowicz , document places that many visitors to the Hamptons will recognize ; some of them also happen to be places where a father first shared with his son the wonders of nature , the pleasures of being in it and the value of living respectfully alongside it . ALEX : Man , that guy on the left is handsome ! I like this picture , as it nicely portrays a dad and his lad . And the large whale skull and the antlers of some far distant ungulate in the background capture my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Guy on the right seems to have gained on me ; we used to be the same height . Better character , too . That finback-whale skull turned up in the surf one December day here in Sagaponack .... I ran a line through the blowhole and tied it up to a stake I drove into the dune to mark the spot . Bud Topping , a local farmer , helped me haul it out of the sea with his tractor . ALEX : My feeling in looking at this field planted with a cover crop is bittersweet . Farmland like this , which once dominated the Sagaponack landscape , has largely been replaced with garish McMansions that consume energy despite being devoid of occupants most of the year . But I also take comfort in knowing that farmers like John White and Cliff Foster have held on to much of their land in the face of a too-easy temptation to cash out . PETER : The first John White came here in the 17th century . Until a few years ago , a field across the way from us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the oldest field in the U.S. continuously farmed by the same family . ALEX : This , apparently , is one of the last of the Little Red School Houses in America . I attended from grades one through four , under the strict tutelage of Mrs. Mae Grubb . There were around thirteen of us in the whole school . My  --  perhaps wishful  --  recollection is that I was a good student . My academic performance declined from there until , after what my stepmother calls my " pizza cowboy " years , I finally turned things around midway through college . It was n't Mrs. Grubb 's fault . She was solid . PETER : Our younger kids all attended this fine village school of two rooms . For many years , having such a small school kept our taxes to a minimum . I remember dropping Alex off on his first day of school in third grade . He was nine . His mother had died the previous year , and now his father was heading off to Nepal . There were many tears . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember the musty smell of my father 's writing studio , which is on the far side of our little apple orchard , a stone 's throw from the house but a world away . When he was into a new book , he had one foot in our world , the other presumably in some far-off land . The mementos depict his life as an explorer , his boundless curiosity and his passion for other cultures and wild places . Together , gathered on one wall , they remind me of his many absences  --  but also of his rootedness at home in Sagaponack , where he has returned from his adventures for the last fifty years . With its beauty and proximity to New York City , Sagaponack suits his naturalist and cosmopolitan sides . Though he might raise an eyebrow at the latter suggestion . PETER : I do n't know how I ever got any work done in this chaos . But the view out the round window looks nice  --  green , anyway . ALEX : I love fishing with my pop  --  we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outing was one of the best of my life . My friend Richard Reagan took us out off Montauk Point , and we ran into a bonanza of stripers and some blues . PETER : I 've been fishing " the Elbow " under the Montauk light for more than fifty years ; even so , this was a memorable day , thanks to Alex and to Richard , both fine fishermen and great company . One blitz of boiling fish feeding on anchovies appeared to be at least one acre in extent  --  very , very exciting . ALEX : I 've been to a lot of beaches around the world , and the beaches along the South Shore of Long Island are still my favorite . The shoreline erosion seen here is a normal and natural result of wave action and storms . And yet the precious dunes of Long Island are disappearing faster than they are getting reestablished , mainly because of too much human activity . Folks need to build their houses behind , not among , the dunes . And beachgoers must heed the signs that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without the dunes , the beaches and the shorebirds will rapidly disappear . PETER : Very well put .
