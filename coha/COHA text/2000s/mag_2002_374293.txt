EPPIE LEDERER AS ANN LANDERS A FRIEND ON THE FEATURE PAGE <P> Her predecessors were prim advice columnists who dipped daintily into the lives of the lovelorn , tiptoeing around , or avoiding completely , realities like divorce , abortion and homosexuality . Then in 1955 Chicago housewife Eppie Lederer took over the syndicated Ann Landers column from a recently deceased nurse who had been doling out tabloid therapy under that pseudonym . With witty , blunt pointers ( " A father who diapers his daughter at the age of 12 has a geranium in his cranium " ) , a heartfelt respect for her readers and a willingness to change her mind , she earned an ardent following of 90 million readers . Dubbed the country 's most influential woman by a World Almanac poll in 1978 , Lederer cherished her ability to help and read several hundred letters a day while soaking in the bathtub . Offers to buy rights to the Ann Landers name were declined . " When I go , " she said , " the column goes with me. "  --  By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Television <P> Before him , TV sets were owned only by the few , the rich . Then , in 1948 , the Tuesday-night Texaco Star Theater exploded like a shtick of nitro , with an assault of vaudeville skits , ancient gags and a man who often dressed as a woman . Suddenly everybody had to have a television  --  all because a middle-aged comic with manic energy and a desperate need to please was making a fool of himself , live , in America 's living rooms . Subtle as a spray of seltzer , Berle dominated the young medium 's ratings for years , at his peak winning 80% of the viewing audience . Eventually , TV grew up  --  anyway , it grew older  --  and by the mid- ' 50s Berle 's innocent vulgarity had given way to more domestic , less frantic fare . But his ghost still haunts the tube . The Fear Factor daredevils , the Jackass prankster-masochists , the talk-show mutants who will do anything for a laugh or a shock  --  all are the nieces and nephews of Uncle Miltie.  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> It 's a Lithuanian name , BUT an American imperative : Johnny , unite us ! Every Sunday afternoon from 1956 to 1972 , Johnny U. laced up his black cleats to mid-calf , put his helmet on over his signature flattop ( so square you could balance a playbook on it ) and gathered the city of Baltimore to watch the birth of modern football . While the rest of the National Football League was scrumming its way forward a few yards at a time , Unitas threw precise , elegant passes that proved how beautiful the game could be . Unitas ' greatest triumph was marching the Colts to a sudden-death victory over the New York Giants in the 1958 NFL championship game . Just before handing off for the winning touchdown , Unitas completed a long sideline pass to his favorite target , Raymond Berry . " Was n't that pass kind of dangerous ? " Unitas was asked . He replied , " Nothing 's dangerous if you know what you 're doing . "  --  By Josh Tyrangiel <P> PRINCESS MARGARET ROYAL LIGHTNING ROD  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
