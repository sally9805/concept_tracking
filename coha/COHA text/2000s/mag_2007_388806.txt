Headnote Halle Berry gets real and goes one-on-one with EBONY Editor Bryan Monroe How do you get the most beautiful woman in the world to climb a tree ? Just ask ... So we did . Halle Maria Berry , the 5 ' ' 7 " actor from Bedford , Ohio , braved chilly temperatures to balance on a wobbly ladder in a designer dress and stretch out on the limb of a Brazilian Pepper Tree . Her climb to the top of her profession , however , has been a bit trickier . The Academy Award-winning actress , burgeoning producer and arguably the most powerful Black woman in Hollywood recently sat down with EBONY MAGAZINE Editorial Director Bryan Monroe for a candid , revealing and sometimes funny glimpse into what makes her " Halle Berry . " She talked about growing up as a mixed-race child in the White suburbs - " I felt very much invisible ... " - shared why she is taking on the new role of producing films and TV projects - " The biggest difference is that you are not just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really wants to be a mother - " That 's the last piece of my life that 's missing , having children . " Berry , a diabetic who recently turned 40 , said she has already achieved more than she had ever imagined . She commands eight-figure salaries to make movies - for Catwoman she was reportedly paid $14 million . She virtually guarantees an opening weekend success with each film she is in - this month she stars as an undercover reporter in the thriller Perfect Stranger with Bruce Willis , and will play the role of a widow opposite Benicio Del Toro this fall in Things We Lost in the Fire . And she is now stepping behind the camera to produce films and television projects . She is developing a movie about Tulia , Texas , where virtually every Black man was arrested and wrongfully convicted in a bogus drug ring ; producing the real-life story of Nevada schoolteacher Tierney Cahill 's run for Congress ; working on a TV comedy , Mixed , about a mixed-race woman ; and creating a project with Alicia Keys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her struggles . Twice married and twice divorced - " I 'll NEVER get married again " she admits she has had problems picking men . And , then there was the trouble with the law . In 2000 , she pled no contest to a misdemeanor charge of leaving the scene of a traffic accident and was ordered to perform 200 hours of community service . Eventually , she put that episode behind her . But what most people do n't know is that , after she did that community service - at the Jenesse Center for Abused Women in Los Angeles - Berry , on her own , has quietly continued to volunteer at the shelter for the past seven years , raising funds and working the occasional weekend . She did n't have to , but , then , she felt she had to . But , there 's a lot folks do n't know about the real Halle Berry . So here she is , in her own words : You 're an August baby ( born Aug. 14 , 1966 ) , a Leo like me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we like to be in charge , in control ? " Umm , yea , pretty much ... that 's me ... Yup ... I need to be in charge . " You grew up outside of Cleveland and you were a high school journalist , editor of your high school newspaper . What was up with that ? " That 's what I wanted to do , journalism . I like to write , I like to read . I went to an all-White school . I wanted to have a voice . I wanted to be heard . And I saw editing the newspaper as a way to do that , to have the control ... because I AM still a Leo ... so I needed control over something . I felt so unheard in my childhood . I wanted a voice . " Why did you feel unheard in your childhood ? " My father left when I was really young , and so I was raised by my mother ( Judith Hawkins ) , who is White , and we went to this all-White school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education . But at that time the inner-city schools where we lived just were n't providing a good enough education . We could n't afford private schools , so we had to go to public schools , had to go out to the suburbs , and they happened to be allWhite , and I felt very much invisible . I left an all-Black neighborhood and moved to an all-White one , and I felt invisible , as if I was not there . So I felt a need in my childhood to make my presence known , to find a way to feel powerful . Editing the school newspaper , being captain of my cheerleading squad , being class president , all those things helped to make me feel a sense of empowerment . " Growing up , especially in the suburbs , going to White schools ... how did you develop who you are as a Black woman ? " My mom . My mom , whose heart is as Black as anybody around , her spirit , her soul , is very much connected to my struggle . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children ( Halle has an older sister , Heidi ) , she felt every pain that we felt , she cried every tear that we cried . She was there when we got the Oreo cookies left in our mailbox . She had to pick us up . She hurt when we hurt . She was the one who actually taught me to love myself , embrace my difference . Every kid wants to be like their mother , and I wanted to be blonde and blue-eyed and have skin like hers . Not that I did n't love who I was , but I wanted to be like her . But she 's the one who said , " No , no , no , you 're beautiful , just as you are . The goal DUMMY TEXT BATCH 73 ARTICLE 23 is n't to be like me , the goal is to be like you , and embrace yourself . ' ' " You 've talked about kids , wanting to have kids , have a family . Where are you with that now ? " I 'm hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As women get older , it should be easier to have children , not harder . Girls , 16 years old , accidentally getting pregnant ... It should be harder to make a baby at 16 than it is at 40 . But , unfortunately , it 's the other way around . " Why do you want to have a baby ? " It 's sort of the full circle of life . I 've spent the last 20 years being very career-oriented , trying to make a difference , reach some of my personal goals . And now I realize that life is really about people . It 's not really about career and fame and things . It 's about being a little less selfish . It 's about what we leave here ; that 's what really matters . That 's the last piece of my life that 's missing , having children . I want to know that . " You 've been married twice , you 're now in a relationship ( with Canadian model Gabriel Aubrey , 31 ) ... So what about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father in the mix ? " I think it 's important , to have a father . But I 've said it before and I mean it , I 'll NEVER get married again . But I do n't think you HAVE to be married to somebody to be a good parent . I want a father ; I want my child to have a father , but I also know that the father and I may not stay in an intimate relationship forever . But I will expect that person to be a good father . So , when I think about who the father will be , it definitely has to be someone who I know will be there . No matter what happens between him and me , is he of the character , of the substance to be a father . No matter what . " What fathers do you look at and go , " Yeah , that 's what I 'm talkin " about ? ' " Not many . I have n't known many strong , dedicated men in my life , unfortunately . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men ... Other than a few close friends , I have n't really seen it in my life ... I need that ... I need that so badly in my life . " The Oscars just happened , there was another AfricanAmerican woman who won one ( Jennifer Hudson for Dreamgirls ) . What did you learn after winning an Oscar ? " What I 've gotten to at this point in life ... after Oscar night , one of things it did was it put an amazing amount of pressure on me . The next morning I woke up and I thought , Oh my God ! ' But then I quickly decided in that same day that I would n't let that pressure come in and sit down on me . I was just going to continue my career the same way I had before that night happened . That meant reserving the right to make choices that I wanted to make , do projects that were fun . Sometimes , do characters that offered me monetary gain , because , this is a career , this is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to plan for , and it 's OK to do that . I mean , acting is n't a hobby , it 's my job . It was OK to take chances , be risky , do silly comedies , even do a Catwoman . Have fun , keep it fresh , never get pigeonholed Do n't let others define what a " Halle " role is . " If you were n't acting , what would you be doing in life ? " I 'd probably be a writer . " What scares you ? " Being without my mother . She 's 66 . She 's in good health , but the day she 's not here , that scares me . " What gets you angry ? " People in a bad mood . People who are funky and nasty and have a bad attitude for no reason . I have a low tolerance for that . There 's no reason , no reason for these people in those funky moods . I ca n't take those people . They are such a downer . That 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 've talked about growing up , about race . Certainly today , with Sen. Barack Obama running for President ... is America ready for a Black President ? " I AM , so I hope they are . I think America is ready for change . After what we 've just experienced , those last two terms , I think we 're ready for anything about now ! And he 's the perfect person for it . I loved him before , but after I read his book , I was SURE that this is the man who should be the first Black President . He is the REAL DEAL . " You are starting to move from in front of the camera as an actor to behind the camera as a producer . Tell me the difference between a project that you own , run , that you are driving , and one where you 're signing on as an actor . " The biggest joy of being a producer , the biggest difference is that you are not just a dancing bear . You are the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting the team together , deciding creatively what 's best for the project . " What about the state of Blacks in Hollywood ? How do you encourage other actors , writers , producers ? " That 's another place where power is born , behind the scenes . I will do backflips down Sunset Boulevard when we have a Black head of a studio . You will see me - I do n't care if I am 60 - down there doing backflips down Hollywood Boulevard . The more we can be an integral part of Hollywood , the business , I think you 'll see us become more and more powerful as a race and people . " How do you see your power , here in Hollywood , not just as an actress , but now looking at scripts , producing ... How do you wield your power today ? " I do think I have power . And most recently , in perhaps the last decade of my life , I 've really come into a real understanding of that power . And on a personal level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally GOT IT , I have finally realized that I 'm complete all by myself . I do n't need a man . I do n't need an Oscar . I do n't need any of that . All of those things are just complements to who I am . I 'm complete , all by my little ole self . " Sidebar Berry grew up in the suburbs near Cleveland .
