Chapter One I ' m guessing that the moment that your life begins to unravel is often unceremonious-heralded by a whimper . The bang should have told me something . I remember mostly details . The extra foam sliding down the side of the mocha . A couple arguing over whether to put the " Mighty OJ " juicer on their bridal registry . The rottweiler tied outside the caf , standing on hind legs , paws pressed urgently against the window . When she walked by , I was reading a languid description of a Boston river , somewhat guiltily speeding through the imagery to get back to the book 's action . I would n't have noticed her at all had she not put a small , folded square of paper on the corner of my table . I registered graceful hands , and a ring on the index finger . Then I focused on the piece of paper . Was I being picked up ? When I looked up again , she was nearly out the screen door , purposeful , and not stopping to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , picked up the folded note , and followed her . I scanned the street . The young transplants who call San Francisco 's Marina District home meandered with designer sunglasses and designer baby strollers , enjoying a fogless July afternoon . Through the crowd , I could see she was halfway into a red Saab parked in front of the PitaParlor . Something kept me from calling out . I figured I 'd wave her down , but she was in the car and pulling away before I could get close enough to yell without making a scene . I looked at the textured beige stationery in my palm . I unfolded the corners , and saw words like a bullhorn : " Get out of the caf-NOW ! " The caf exploded . Smoke . Car alarms . Glass , ashes , a cloud of dust . A sound inside my head like a hangover delivered via freight train . I do n't think I ever lost consciousness . The blast took me three feet through the air , dropped me on the pavement , but seemed to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the world seems to be coming undone . This was nothing like that-just a single moment of extraordinary violence , followed by haze . Like a bloody version of the time my father slammed a stainless steel pot on the kitchen floor to get my brother 's attention . The front window of the caf was blown out , and a side wall was ripped , though not torn down , exposing metal and concrete innards . A couple wandered out from the screen door ; he held an arm limply at his side , her bloody legs churned between step and stumble . The owner of the rottweiler checked his pet for wounds . These days , you imagine the first thought at such a moment would be of terrorism . My first thought was of Annie . She was rarely far from my mind , even four years after the accident that took her life at the age of twenty-eight . Mostly , I 'd thought of her at moments of transition-when I got up , climbed into bed , or on a long drive between interviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was in those moments , the quiet instances when life lacked structure , that I most needed a place to focus . I would n't defend my relationship with Annie as perfect , but it defined love for me , and endured . She was always chewing strong breath mints , causing our kisses to taste spicy , and I got sad when I smelled cinnamon . Sometimes at night , I told an imaginary Annie stories aloud and tried to guess at which point she would have sleepily asked me to wrap it up . But it was more than longing that made me think of her as a thin layer of dust settled over me . It was the note I 'd been handed . I 'd know Annie 's handwriting anywhere . " Can you move your legs ? " The words came through my fog from a police officer , kneeling beside me . I waved my hand to say , " I 'm fine . " I started to stand , and he helped guide me up by the elbow . " We need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awareness returned , so did the sounds and colors , and the chaos . Police and firefighters , the sound of radio chatter , helicopters . I was embedded in the evening news . The officer led me toward an area apparently being set up for the wounded . Was I hurt worse than I thought ? " Mystic River , " the police officer said . I looked at him with confusion . " Good book , " he added . " But you really should invest in the hardback . It 's a sign of a fully committed person . " I looked down and saw I still had the novel I 'd been reading in the caf . My white knuckles told me I 'd been clutching it like a life preserver . The note . Where was it ? I fished in my pockets , but came up empty . I turned around and headed back to where I 'd been lifted off the ground . " Hold on , pardner . We ca n't have you going back there . Too dangerous . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone ? " " Something . I lost something . Please . " " Well , you 're not going back to get it now . " With a powerful hand on my shoulder , he turned me around , walked me down the block to a concrete patch cordoned off by yellow tape , and set me on the ground with the others . The cop 's name was Danny Weller , and he was a chatterer . He told me about growing up in Oakland , and learning to fish in waders in the Sacramento River with his father . His dad , he said , was a fierce wordsmith , the outer casing of a union man covering a dictionary . Danny stayed nearby-my personal caseworker . He kept my state of mind numb , but his friendly rambling did n't slow the background din of questions . Who would do such a thing ? Did someone try to save my life ? Was that person connected to Annie ? And what happened to everyone else in the caf ? How many hurt ? How many dead ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatalities and a couple people in critical , " Danny said . " Not as miraculous as it first appeared . " " What do you mean ? " I looked at a half dozen people sitting on the street around me , nursing various wounds . Each was attended by police and emergency medical personnel . The idea that anyone survived seemed miraculous . " The explosion was confined to one area of the caf-it 's not as bad as we first thought , " Danny said . " At this point , we do n't know if it was intentional or an industrial accident . " " You mean it might not have been a bomb ? " " What makes you think it was a bomb ? " Danny looked at me intently , with curiosity but not accusation . I took him in for the first time . I noticed hair and gut ; he had a lot of both . I figured him at around forty-five years old . Worn , blue-collar hands , no wedding ring , but that did n't mean anything anymore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the black and chocolate-brown-colored glass polar bear eyes from the taxidermist 's office where I interned the summer before my senior year in college . Before I could get out an answer to Danny 's question , a paramedic knelt beside me . " He seems okay , " Danny said . " He was outside when it happened . " " Let 's have a look , " the paramedic said , tilting my chin up so I could look him in the eye . " I 'm going to ask you some basic questions . Indulge me . What 's your name ? " " Nathaniel . Nathaniel Idle . " " Nat Idle , " Danny the cop said . I 'd told him my first name earlier , but not my last . The paramedic and I turned our heads to look . Danny turned his eyes to the side , the way a bad poker player fails to mask emotion , and I ca n't say I was surprised . A year earlier , when I was researching an article about the HIV epidemic faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come across a disturbing tip . Several officers assigned to crack down on the residential brothels were sampling the fare rather than bringing the violators to justice . One of the cops , upon learning he might have contracted HIV himself , beat a twenty-year-old Malaysian prostitute with the battle end of a flashlight . The cop-Timothy Aravelo-and two colleagues were convicted . Publicly , a number of police officers lauded my efforts . It was politically correct to do so . Privately , they said I had exaggerated the problems of one bad cop and his own domestic dispute and turned it into a crusade . I was viewed as a member of the corner-cutting sensationalist media . " No obvious broken bones , a laceration on the forehead , scrapes to knees , elbows , and hands . Consistent with a forceful fall , " the paramedic said . " You did the right thing , " Danny said . The paramedic thought Danny was talking to him . I knew what he really meant . " Thanks , " I said . " Danny , look , something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Danny cut me off . " We 're doing preliminary interviews with everyone who was in the area . We like to get impressions while they 're fresh . You 're our next contestant . " He pulled me up by the hand and bent in close . " Ordinarily , Lieutenant Aravelo would ask you a few gentle questions and then give you a pat on the back . But you might get slightly rougher treatment . " (
