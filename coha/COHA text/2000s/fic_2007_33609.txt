Chapter One A grinding cold had settled down over Stone County and most of northern Arkansas . As Lanie Freeman hurried to slip into her dress , she noted the frost on the windowpanes and shivered . Her upstairs bedroom had a small wood-burning fireplace , but she only used it when she stayed up late reading or writing . Her dress was made of gray lightweight wool with long sleeves , a high neckline , and a fringe of black lace around the edges . Even so , it did not provide enough warmth against the early morning chill . Moving over to the mirror above her dresser , she studied herself with a critical eye . A faint memory brushed the edges of her mind , pulling the corners of her lips into a smile . The memory brought back a day when she had cried because she was so skinny . One of the boys at school had called her " Rake handle , " and she had flown at him in a rage . Only Davis had been able to pull her off of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anymore . " The young woman gazing back at her from the mirror certainly was no rake handle ! As Lanie considered the lissome curves clearly outlined by the dress , she remembered an entry she had made in her journal when she was much younger . Moving to the pine chest of drawers against the wall , she opened the bottom drawer and pulled out one of many notebooks concealed beneath her folded clothing . She opened the book and , ignoring her shivers , read the entry dated April the twelfth , 1928 : I had to kill Lucille today , and it broke my heart . I hated to do it , but I had to admit she was delicious . I fried her for supper , and we ate all of her . Mama only ate a little bit of the breast and some of the gravy . I 'll be glad when the baby comes and Mama 's strong again , and I 'll be glad if I ever fatten up a little bit . Lanie felt a keen sense of pain as she remembered her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short time left on earth . She was carrying Corliss and would give her life to bring the baby girl into the world . She leafed through the journal , sometimes smiling as her words brought touching memories , sometimes frowning as her words brought with them pangs of sorrow . When she came to an entry where a letter marked the place , she smoothed back the page and read her words again , just as she had many times before . They 're going to put us in a foster home if something do n't happen . But I 've heard about my daddy 's aunt who 's in a nursing home in Oklahoma . We 're going to try to get her to come and live with us so the government wo n't break our family up . Lanie next opened the letter , which was from her Aunt Kezia to her father . Forrest , my husband has died and the fool spent all his money on a hussy from Muskogee . I 'd have shot him if I had caught him and her too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living in a room in a rundown boarding house full of idiots ! Got a little money , but when that plays out , they 'll put me in some kind of old folks ' home . Bah ! I 'll shoot myself before I put up with that . A wave of affection for Aunt Kezia filled Lanie . In spite of her advanced age , the old woman had brought safety to the Freeman household . With Lanie 's mother dead and her father in prison , the state had almost broken up the family , but Aunt Kezia had provided a safe haven for them all . Her sharp tongue was sometimes difficult to live with , but Lanie loved her . She thumbed through the pages and stopped abruptly at the entry marked July the fourth , 1931 . That had been the last Fourth of July , and the memory of it was etched clearly on her memory . As she read her words , her cheeks turned warm . At the fair today I was standing at the Ferris wheel afraid to get in because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Owen was there , and he teased me into getting on the Ferris wheel with him . We got in and I hung on , but I was scared . He put his arm around me , and when the car started rocking I just threw myself against him and hung on as if I was a little girl and he was my daddy . But it was n't like that . As I was pressed against him , I knew he was aware I was n't the little girl he always thinks of when he thinks of Lanie Freeman . And I knew he was n't the father figure either . I could have let go but I did n't want to . I just held onto him and pretended I was frightened . I know it was wrong , but it 'll never come to anything else . He 's engaged to Louise now , and I 've had to put that dream away . For a long moment Lanie stood in the center of the room staring down at the words . She had written things in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought drew her to her writing desk . Still shivering against the cold , she pulled on a sweater and rubbed her hands together to warm her fingers . Then she opened the notebook , picked up a pen , and began to write : December 27 , 1931 Owen is not married to Louise Langley . That 's the biggest thing in my life right now . She broke their engagement , and when I heard of it my heart nearly jumped out of my chest . (
