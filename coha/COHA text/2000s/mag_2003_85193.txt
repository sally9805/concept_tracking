Seven years ago the city was split along racial lines over whether to honor Ashe with a statue on Monument Avenue , where figures of Confederate heroes stand .

The latest measure would have renamed a 2 ? - mile road known as the Boulevard , which passes Byrd Park , where Ashe , who died in 1993 , was barred from playing as a 12-year-old due to segregation laws .
