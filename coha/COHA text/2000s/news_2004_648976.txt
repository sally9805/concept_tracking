<p> Rashidat Sadiq 's first practice with the five-time N.C.A.A. champion Connecticut Huskies was on Nov. 4 . But Sadiq , who grew up playing basketball with older boys in her Lagos , Nigeria , neighborhood , looked as if she belonged on the court at Gampel Pavilion . <p> Sadiq , a 6-foot-2 forward , hustled at both ends of the court , blocking shots , rebounding and creating plays with pinpoint passes . A two-time junior college All-American who played on the Nigerian Olympic team in Athens , she played like an unproven walk-on determined to show Connecticut Coach Geno Auriemma that she could make a successful transition from Central Arizona College in Coolidge , Ariz . <p> Sadiq finished her two years as C.A.C. 's career leading scorer , with 1,629 points . She ranked second in the nation as a sophomore last season with a 24.9 scoring average while leading Central Arizona to a 33-3 record and a third-place finish at the junior college Division I tournament . She was named Arizona Community College Athletic Conference player of the year the past two seasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arizona seemed like a distant memory now . She has a new college , a new coach and new teammates who are getting to know her . <p> " I will do all I can to help my team and to defend the championship and to bring it home again , " Sadiq , 23 , said before practice . " That is why we practice every day and we are getting better . You do what we have to do . " <p> When her teammates made a good play in practice , Sadiq extended high-fives . When she was on the sideline , she paced , applauding and cheering even the most routine plays . Her teammates , in turn , exhorted her successful moves and whispered words of encouragement when she failed to execute a play . <p> " Rashidat is just a really hard worker , " said Jessica Moore , the Huskies ' 6-3 senior center/forward . " Everything she does , she really tries to go hard and give it everything that she possibly can . It 's really hard to come here , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know anything , so we really have to help her , to bring her along . " <p> Sadiq said : " There is nothing any better than being loved by your teammates . I think unity is a very important thing to a team . If the unity is there , everything will go well for them . " <p> Auriemma seemed to be testing Sadiq 's tenacity last week during the team 's first two-hour practice . Although he said he had not had a lot of luck with transfer students , Auriemma recruited Sadiq because there was something he admired about her . <p> " Coming from Nigeria , the struggle she went through to get here , her family struggle back home and just her commitment to herself and her education and the pride she takes in who she is and the way she carries herself , " Auriemma said without pause . " I just wanted her to be a part of my team because I think that is reflective of who we are . " <p> But Auriemma acknowledged with a smile that he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always open , always gets the ball , has great quick hands , always gets the ball on the rim , but it never goes in , " he said . " And I 'm thinking , you do n't score that many points in junior college . It 's just a matter of time before they start going in . " <p> Sadiq seemed surprised to have been recruited by Connecticut . At Central Arizona , she sometimes received 50 bags of mail a week containing recruitment letters from schools like Louisiana Tech , Florida State and Fresno State . When she opened the letter from Connecticut , her initial reaction was mixed , she said . <p> " I think , ' Oh , they want me , too , " ' she said . " I do n't think I 'm that good . " <p> Auriemma telephoned her last spring to tell her he wanted her to play for the Huskies . <p> " I do n't remember all he said but he said some great stuff , " Sadiq said . " He said I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can achieve my future goal , because it is going to motivate me to make me better in practice . " <p> In the two years Sadiq spent at Central Arizona , neither her mother , Ayisha , nor her father , Adisa , or her four siblings were able to see her play . Her parents had never heard of the University of Connecticut until Sadiq returned home in August and told them about it . <p> " My mother started dancing and singing praises to God , " said Sadiq , who speaks with a soft lyrical lilt . " My family is not rich . We can not afford cable or satellite dish . These are part of the reasons why my family do n't know much about Connecticut . But now that I come here , I think they will get everything with Connecticut on it . " <p> Sadiq 's journey to the pinnacle of Division I basketball began when she saw an N.B.A. game on television when she was 12 . Soccer is Nigeria 's favorite pastime , and Sadiq was a promising midfielder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she saw that N.B.A. game , her soccer-playing days were over . She began playing basketball with her older brothers and neighborhood boys who were much bigger . They used a standard-size N.B.A. ball , played four quarters with no over-the-back foul calls on offensive or defensive rebounds and automatic two shots on personal fouls . <p> The neighbors cautioned Sadiq 's parents that basketball was too masculine a game for their younger of two daughters . After initial reservations , Sadiq 's mother approved of her playing basketball . <p> " A couple of my friends say , ' That 's the girl that plays basketball , " ' Sadiq said . " They 'd tease me and say , ' Hey , you 're looking masculine . ' And I say , ' You do n't have to do that . This is what I want to do . " ' <p> She began to block taller boys ' shots . She received a scholarship to play basketball in the United States . She was chosen to represent Nigeria at the Summer Olympics and was part of the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , people back home asked her to teach their daughters and sons how to play . <p> " Someday I would like to start a basketball camp in Nigeria for girls and boys , because that is the only way we can really encourage young kids to play , " Sadiq said . And some of the same boys that teased her are now in awe of her . <p> " Now some are saying , ' I wish I started playing basketball when you did , " ' Sadiq said . " I was like , ' Where were you ? You were mocking me . " ' <p> Sadiq said she missed home and longed for her mother 's embrace and traditional dishes . The memory of home momentarily brought tears to her eyes . But she said she had found a new home on the expansive Connecticut campus . A business information systems major , Sadiq got lost on her first day of classes . <p> " I had a school map , but I could n't tell where my classes were , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I know where I 'm going . " <p> Sadiq said Connecticut was her home now and her teammates were her family . Even members of the men 's national championship team have embraced her . <p> " When they see you , they say , ' Hey what 's up ? " ' Sadiq said . " They make you feel like you are part of our family . This is good . As long as they can do that to a stranger , someone who has just come into the family , that is a good thing .
