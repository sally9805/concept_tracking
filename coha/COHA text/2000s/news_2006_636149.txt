<p> IT 'S UPHILL FOR HILLARY <p> Less than six months before the two-year presidential election cycle begins , Sen. Hillary Clinton 's political problems loom larger than ever . The front-runner for the Democratic nomination is coasting toward her assured re-election in New York without serious Republican opposition . But a new Gallup Poll turns the spotlight on the biggest political obstacle to her future ambitions , raising new questions about whether Democrats would be better advised to pick someone far less polarizing in 2008 . <p> All in all , the public is just about as likely to come up with positive views of Clinton as they are to come up with negative views . Thirty-six percent of Americans could not name anything they admire about Clinton , while 39 percent could not name anything they do n't like about her . Overall , the public perception of Clinton 's image was 51 percent favorable and 44 percent unfavorable . But the intensity of the reactions among those who dislike her revealed a major political weakness that could become a strategic issue in her party 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another problem , " pollster John Zogby told me . " She has carved a position for herself in the center on defense and other national-security issues , and she 's alienating large swaths of voters on the left who oppose the war in Iraq . " <p> Bill Clinton 's ascendancy to the presidency was the result of a brilliant balancing act that brought his party 's centrists and liberals together behind a candidacy that appealed to both at the same time . Achieving that feat a second time is Hillary 's daunting challenge . <p> Donald Lambro , townhall.com <p> DEFICIT TO DIP , BUT . . . <p> President Bush is right when he says more money is flowing into the Treasury this year than last , which means the federal budget deficit will be lower . But it 's important to put this good news in context . This year 's federal budget deficit will still total between $280 and $300 billion . <p> Federal spending is still way out of control . It 's at a higher rate and a higher percentage of the overall economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly . But they 're still running $100 billion less than what the White House projected five years ago when it sold its tax cuts . <p> The basic question is whether those tax cuts have helped or hurt the economy . The White House supply-side gang says they 've helped , and points to the slight upturn in tax revenues to argue its case . But every economic recovery offers good news . That 's why we call them recoveries . The business cycle is , after all , a cycle . <p> The best way to find out whether the Bush tax cuts have really helped is to compare the current recovery with every previous recovery since World War II . What do we find ? Real revenue growth in this one is trailing the average of all previous recoveries . So is the rate of new investment . So is the rate of job creation . <p> The President 's supply-side tax cuts have had only one conspicuously positive effect , for one conspicuous group . They 've helped people earning over $200K a year become fabulously richer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's understandable if they want to parade around in their designer clothes . The rest of us , though , are still caught in a downpour . <p> Robert Reich , American Prospect <p> GETTING THE KINKS OUT <p> The debate about the best choices for " black hair , " always charged , is flaring up again . A Louisiana sheriff said last week that anyone on the streets in dreadlocks " can expect to be getting a visit from a sheriff 's deputy " because a murder suspect answering that description remained at large . In April , Susan L. Taylor , the iconic editorial director of Essence magazine , canceled a campus speech when she discovered the college forbids its students to wear " unusual " hairstyles  --  including braids , which are Taylor 's signature look . Then it was discovered that Black Enterprise magazine had a similar ban for student interns . <p> The message is clear . If blacks want to have a chance in the increasingly unforgiving corporate world , they will have to shave off their edges  --  starting with their hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such a message implies a false choice between assimilation and self-affirmation . What looks like practicality is , in fact , more denial . <p> By being forced to change their hair , black people once again are being forced to shoulder the burden of proof : We 're not as fearsome as we look . It 's up to us to mitigate our dark skin and ethnic features by framing them with hair that 's as neat and unethnic as possible . <p> That the requirement comes from black institutions only makes it more disturbing . Braids and other natural styles have long been associated with socially conscious and self-confident black people , the kind who would fit nicely in corporate settings that like to say diversity is a priority . But companies tend not to hire them , and black people with those hairstyles tend to gravitate toward work that 's necessarily non-corporate . Yet surely we have all earned the right to wear our hair as we please . The freedom we 're still working toward is supposed to be aesthetic as well as economic . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CORRUPTION ? <p> What causes corruption ? Many economists believe it is a response to perverse incentives . In Indonesia , it takes 151 days to legally establish a small business . This is a large incentive to pay bribes or keep a business unregistered . It is not surprising that there is a strong correlation between red tape and corruption . The harder it is to make money legally , the more tempting it will be to do so illegally ; and if people are not punished for stealing , they will be more likely to steal . <p> This view suggests that if you take a person from a poor , corrupt economy and move him to a richer , less corrupt economy , he will live up to the new system that surrounds him . An alternative view , popular among the common-sense crowd , is that corruption is a problem in Indonesia because Indonesians are crooks by nature . <p> I disagree out of faith , rather than because the evidence is compelling . But then , what evidence could there be ? You would need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere where they could ignore the law with impunity , and see who cheated . Economists Ray Fisman and Edward Miguel realized that diplomats in New York City were the perfect guinea pigs . Diplomatic immunity meant parking tickets issued to diplomats could not be enforced , and so parking legally was essentially a matter of personal ethics . <p> Fisman and Miguel discovered that countries with corrupt systems , as measured by Transparency International , also sent diplomats who parked illegally . From 1997-2005 , the famously incorruptible Scandinavians committed only 12 unpaid parking violations , and most of them were by a single diplomat from Finland . But over the same period of time Chad and Bangladesh , regularly at the top of the corruption tables , managed to produce more than 2,500 violations between them . Perhaps poor countries are poor because they are full of corrupt people , after all . <p> Tim Harford , Slate <p> TOO MUCH INFORMATION <p> When Ben Bernanke took over from Alan Greenspan as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board , one of his goals was to make the Fed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentences parsable only by semioticians , Bernanke advocated a plain-spoken style . But instead of smoothing markets , Bernanke 's public statements have confused them , earning him a reputation for flightiness . Investors are saying , will Bernanke please shut up . <p> Let 's hope not . While his attempt to open the doors of the Fed wider has had a rocky start , it 's the logical next step in a welcome trend toward transparency that started under Greenspan . For now , one of Bernanke 's great strengths  --  comfort with the uncertain nature of monetary policy  --  is seen by the market as a weakness . While Greenspan was also comfortable with uncertainty , his impenetrable rhetoric made it easy to believe that , underneath all the caveats , he really was certain . <p> Bernanke 's initial instinct was the right one . Markets may mess up in the short run , but they learn in the long run . A recent study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland , for instance , found that the Fed 's greater openness since 1999  --  when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future  --  has significantly reduced the mistakes that investors make in predicting what the Fed will do , with the result that markets have been less volatile and less risky . People may want to be kept in the dark , but they 're ultimately better off when the Fed sheds more light . <p> James Surowiecki , New Yorker <p> DR .
