<p> NEW YORK As foul legions of mutant soldiers swarm a fortress at the climactic battle of Helm 's Deep in The Two Towers , good King Theoden flares his noble nostrils and declares , " So it begins . . . " <p> Actually , so it begins again . And expectations are towering . <p> As swift as an arrow launched by an elfin archer , a year has sped by since The Fellowship of the Ring , the first of three epic films based on J.R.R. Tolkien 's literary classic The Lord of the Rings , cast its sword-and-sorcery spell upon the worldwide box office . It took in $ 860 million and ruled the Oscars with 13 nominations , winning four . <p> If advance sales on online ticketing site Fandango are any sort of crystal ball , the spell may be more powerful this time . The Two Towers , which opens Wednesday , is generating more requests than any movie in the 2-year-old service 's history , accounting for 77% of all requests this week . <p> Seems like only yesterday that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by such celebrated Middle-earthlings as Gandalf the wizard ( Ian McKellen ) and hunksome warrior Aragorn ( Viggo Mortensen ) in his quest to destroy an evil ring and save the world . Especially if you only just waded through the exhaustive four-disc DVD . <p> The pressure to not just succeed but exceed should be bearing down upon Peter Jackson like the fire-belching Balrog that tussles with Gandalf . The 41-year-old filmmaker , previously best known for 1994 's strikingly strange Heavenly Creatures , initially seemed as unlikely a choice as Frodo to pull off an astonishing , history-altering feat : Namely , shoot a trio of three-hour fantasy adventures across 15 months in his native New Zealand , jam in a gee-whizzy pageant of digital trickery , stitch in scenes done later to heighten the drama , and release them in back-to-back years . <p> Instead , the bearded butterball exudes a wizardly cool as he ambles into the room in his usual eccentric way , in summery shorts and barefoot despite the biting cold outside . It 's as if he had stepped into Fellowship 's Prancing Pony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his latest , and admittedly most difficult to assemble , chapter of the trilogy . <p> " It feels good to get this done , " he says . " We got the hard one out of the way . It does n't have a beginning and it does n't have an end . It complicates and expands the story . But we wanted to make it stand by itself . " <p> It not only stands , it moves . Fellowship , with its Oscar-winning effects ( the jelly-belly cave troll ) and emotional losses ( the death of Boromir , undone by ring lust ) , set off a few feisty skirmishes but was mainly exposition . Some less in the throes of spectacle even dared to deride it as sluggish . <p> In The Two Towers , less cuddly and more cutthroat than its predecessor , the action charges forth in earnest , splinters into thirds and barely stops for a breath . Frodo and loyal protector Sam ( Sean Astin ) must rely on the duplicitous gremlin Gollum as a guide through enemy territory . Aragorn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gimli ( John Rhys-Davies ) throw in their lot with Theoden ( Bernard Hill ) , whose kingdom of Rohan is under siege . Meanwhile , hobbits Merry ( Dominic Monaghan ) and Pippin ( Billy Boyd ) flee from savage captors and hang out with a woodsy giant named Treebeard . <p> After winnowing four-plus hours to a lean-by-comparison 179 minutes , Jackson appears confident . ( Extras such as a poetry reading by Treebeard that 's especially treasured by the director will wind up on the extended DVD . ) He 's confident enough to eschew any introductory plot recap for potential newbies , despite pressure from New Line Cinema , the studio releasing the films . In his pragmatic Kiwi view , if you 're too cheap to do your homework and rent the video , too bad . " There 's not really an excuse , " he says . <p> Besides , he knows these timeless tales , published in the ' 50s and the foundation for many of the fantasy fads that have followed , from Dungeons &; Dragons to Harry Potter , have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sequels . <p> " Sequels , by their nature , are trying to replicate the success of the first . So you are thinking everybody liked this in the first one , so we have to have it again in the second . Whereas because we shot our movies at the same time and based them on the books , we 're separate from the usual dynamic . " <p> Jackson is equally unflappable while multitasking to the max on set . Says Wood : " There is madness there . He is very opinionated and knows what he wants . Yet he remains so friendly and so relaxed . " <p> Miranda Otto , the Australian actress who joins the cast as Eowyn , the luminously pale Rohan maiden whose stoic heart beats faster when near Aragorn , says : " I do n't know how he did it . I would have gone mental in about two weeks . These are n't cheap movies . When you get the money , you are responsible for the money . But it never seemed to show on him . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he co-founded with longtime friend Jackson : " He 's in touch with reality through the bottom of his bare feet . That is what gives him the edge to create something of such magnitude . Although we always have to sweep the workshop before he visits . " <p> Many like to compare Jackson to a hobbit . Much like Frodo , he is smart enough to rely on the talents and strengths of others to achieve his goals . That includes his own family . His partner in life and at work is his fellow Rings screenwriter Fran Walsh . " There 's huge amounts of trust , " he says . Even their two children , Kate , 6 , and Billy , 7 , have roles in each film . <p> In the first , they were hobbit youngsters . In the second , they are Rohan refugees . In the third , they are Gondorians . " Always being just perfect in their roles , " Papa says with a proud smile . The children grew up during Rings , and many others have seen their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The star . Wood , who was 17 when he was hired as Frodo and turns 22 next month , found fame in such movies as Avalon ( 1990 ) and The Ice Storm ( 1997 ) long before he flopped about in furry hobbit feet . <p> But being in such an internationally popular film series places him in a more exclusive club of actors . " Everywhere I go I have to deal with it , " he says . " I hear lots of ' Hey , Frodo . ' " <p> He also has become a regular in gossip columns . ( For the record , he no longer is dating German actress Franka Potente of The Bourne Identity and calls himself " happily single . " ) It 's not that he 's partying more . " The funny thing is , if anything , I 've chilled out . " <p> Wood is understandably prone to more intimate films in between his Rings duties . His next movie is definitely an elf-free zone : Thumbsucker , based on Walter Kirn 's quirky comic novel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Middle-earth , New Zealand also has benefited from movie exposure . The Colorado-size country of 3.8 million has witnessed a boom in tourism , and its government estimates that the trilogy will pump about $ 400 million into the economy . Jackson 's happening hometown of Wellington , redubbed " Wellywood , " reports an estimated 10% increase in visitors . <p> Says Karl Urban , a Kiwi himself who is introduced as Eowyn 's brother , Eomer , in The Two Towers , " The morale of the whole country was lifted . " <p> * The company . Before Rings , New Line Cinema took risks ( Magnolia , American History X ) but it mainly was known as the home of fiendish Freddy Krueger and funny Austin Powers , not a fearless producer of pricey Oscar fare . But that has changed , co-chairmen Bob Shaye and Michael Lynne say . <p> " The films have increased our pride factor , " Shaye says . " It has validated us in the creative community . " <p> The Fellowship of the Rings " showed we are capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this to the highest level , " Lynne adds . <p> The company already is developing two more multi-part sagas , although rights issues probably will snag any hopes for a live-action The Hobbit , Tolkien 's gentler precursor to The Lord of the Rings . Tom Stoppard ( Shakespeare in Love ) is adapting British author Philip Pullman 's trilogy His Dark Materials , about a young girl who travels to different worlds . Another franchise in the making is Iron Man , based on the millionaire industrialist comic-book hero . <p> * The magic shop . Weta also has become an effects force on par with George Lucas and his Industrial Light &; Magic , despite its Down Under locale . <p> Besides finishing The Return of the King , the Rings finale due next December , Weta ( pronounced wet-ah and named after an indestructible cricket-like insect ) is involved in The Last Samurai with Tom Cruise , a new version of Peter Pan being done in Australia and the Russell Crowe sea yarn Master and Commander . <p> As for Jackson , his status has certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much in it . One thing he refuses to do again is waste precious weeks of Rings post-production on stumping for Oscars . <p> " I wo n't be doing any promoting again , " he says . " I felt like I was in the middle of a very political race . " <p> Not that he is worried about No. 3 , The Return of the King , at all . " When we were shooting , it just felt good . Everything climaxes in that movie and it all pays off . <p> " And , " he says with a satisfied grin , " it has an ending . "
