Politics He has a tight circle of trust , and he likes it that way . But members of both parties are urging Bush to reach beyond the White House walls . How he governs  --  and how his M.O . stacks up historically <p> JACK MURTHA STILL CA N'T FIGURE OUT WHY THE father and son treated him so differently . Every week or so before the ' 91 gulf war , President George H.W. Bush would invite Congressman Murtha , along with other Hill leaders , to the White House . " He would listen to all the bitching from everybody , Republicans and Democrats , and then he would do what he thought was right . " A decorated Vietnam veteran , ex-Marine Murtha was a critical supporter for the elder Bush on Capitol Hill . " I led the fight for the ' 91 war , " he says . " I led the fight , for Christ 's sake . " <p> Yet 13 years later , when Murtha tried to write George W. Bush with some suggestions for fighting the Iraq war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House ( after waiting for seven months , Murtha received a polite kiss-off from a deputy under secretary of Defense ) . Murtha , who has always preferred to operate behind the scenes , finally went public , calling for an orderly withdrawal from Iraq . In the furor that followed , a White House spokesman compared the Vietnam War hero to " Michael Moore and the extreme liberal wing of the Democratic Party . " When that approach backfired , President Bush called Murtha a " fine man . who served our country with honor . " The White House has made no attempt to reach out to Murtha since then . " None . None . Zero . Not one call , " a baffled Murtha told NEWSWEEK . " I do n't know who the hell they 're talking to . If they talked to people , they would n't get these outbursts . If they 'd talked to me , it would n't have happened . " <p> A White House aide , who like virtually all White House officials ( in this story and in general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president , says that Murtha was a lost cause anyway and dismisses the notion that Bush is isolated or out of touch . Still , the complaints do n't just come from Democrats : Sen. Richard Lugar , Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , pointedly told reporters that Bush needs to " have much more of a cadre of people in both houses , from both parties " visiting the White House " very frequently . " Lugar cited Bill Clinton as the model . <p> President Bush has always shown an admirable ability to ignore the Washington pundits and make fun of the chattering classes . Yet his inattention to Murtha , a coal-country Pennsylvanian and rock-solid patriot , suggests a level of indifference , if not denial , that is dangerous for a president who seeks to transform the world . All presidents face a tension between sticking to their guns and dealing with changing reality . History suggests it can be a mistake to listen too closely to the ever-present ( and often self-aggrandizing ) critics . But likewise , the idea that any president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , problematic . <p> Clearly , George W. Bush 's role model is not his father , who every week would ride down from the White House to the House of Representatives gymnasium , just to hear what fellows like Murtha were saying . Nor is the model John F. Kennedy , who during the Cuban missile crisis reached out to form an " ExCom " of present and past national-security officials , from both parties , to find some way back from the abyss short of war . Nor is it Franklin Roosevelt , who liked to create competition between advisers to find the best solution . Or Abraham Lincoln who , as historian Doris Kearns Goodwin writes in her new book , " Team of Rivals , " appointed his political foes to his cabinet . <p> Bush likes to say that his hero is Ronald Reagan , a true-blue conservative who knew his own mind . But Reagan also knew when to compromise , and when he got into trouble early in his second term , he reached out for help , making a moderate , former senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance that George W. Bush will give a top White House job to an establishment moderate ( say , Brent Scow-croft , his father 's national-security adviser ) is about the same as that Texas will become a province of France . <p> Bush may be the most isolated president in modern history , at least since the late-stage Richard Nixon . It 's not that he is a socially awkward loner or a paranoid . He can charm and joke like the frat president he was . Still , beneath a hail-fellow manner , Bush has a defensive edge , a don't-tread-on-me prickliness . It shows in Bush 's humor . When Reagan told a joke , it almost never was about someone in the room . Reagan 's jokes may have been scatological or politically incorrect , but they were inclusive , intended to make everyone join in the laughter . Often , Bush 's joking is personal  --  it is aimed at you . The teasing can be flattering ( the president gave me a nickname ! ) , but it is intended , however so subtly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a towel-snap that invites a retort . How many people dare to snap back at a president ? <p> Not many , and not unless they have known the president a long , long time . ( Even Karl Rove , or " Turd Blossom , " as he is sometimes addressed by the president , knows when to hold his tongue . ) In the Bush White House , disagreement is often equated with disloyalty . <p> Lately , there are some signs that the White House is trying to dispel the image of the Bush Bubble ( or Bunker ) . Last week , as part of a campaign to reach out to critics , the president addressed the Council on Foreign Relations , a bastion of East Coast establishment moderates . This week Bush will entertain a delegation of Hill Democrats ( routine in the administrations of his father and Reagan , very unusual under this president ) . In his public comments , Bush for the first time is acknowledging that the war in Iraq has not gone quite as well as hoped for . And some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . <p> Yet such concessions may be more show than substance . White House officials , as well as one of his closest friends ( also speaking anonymously so as not to complicate relations with the president ) , say that Bush remains sure that he is on the proper course in Iraq and that ultimately he will be vindicated by history . The president may be right . The Iraqi elections next week could produce a government that survives the insurgency and establishes the first ( albeit shaky and not quite Western style ) democracy in an Arab state  --  even if that looks like a long haul by today 's light . With an improving economy , Bush 's popularity could well rebound . Washington pendulums always swing ; Bush 's polls appear to have bottomed out and are rising , at least slightly . <p> In any case , the record so far suggests that Bush is not likely to change in any fundamental way in the three years that remain in his term . He has won two presidential elections and one war ( Afghanistan ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winning two more ( Iraq and the Global War on Terror , or GWOT ) . His character was forged by hard-won struggles with drink and more shadowy demons , and he has been redeemed by faith . Bush sometimes compares himself to other presidents , usually in terms of how not to do the job . These comparisons are instructive , though not always as flattering as Bush thinks : <p> Bush is not Bill Clinton . Bush recoiled from the sloppiness and waffling of his predecessor . He has no use for the kind of endless , circular collegiate bull sessions that characterized Clinton 's administration . In 43 's White House , meetings start on time , everyone wears a suit and pizza boxes are nowhere to be seen . But Clinton was able to see , in a way that Bush perhaps does not , that the White House can be , as Clinton put it in his sometimes whiny way , " the crown jewel of the federal prison system . " Clinton insisted on having his own private phone line and fax line so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those on the receiving end , at 2 a.m . ) . <p> Bush is not Lyndon Johnson . Johnson liked to keep three TVs blaring in his office , and he would call reporters at home to browbeat them . Bush has said he does not read the newspapers ( actually , he does ) . " I 'm not LBJ , " Bush told a recent gathering of lawmakers . " I 'm not going to sit around some map room and micromanage the war . " Bush was slightly confusing his wars and presidents . It was Franklin Roosevelt who ran World War II from the Map Room ; LBJ descended into the Situation Room in the basement to pick bombing targets . It is true that LBJ was nearly driven mad by his obsession with Vietnam and his insecurities about the " Harvards , " whom he blamed for sucking him into the war . But forced to listen to his critics  --  the so-called Wise Men who gathered at the White House in March 1968 to tell him that the war was unwinnable  --  LBJ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops from Vietnam . <p> Bush is not his father . It is not necessary to read Sophocles ' Oedipus Rex to see Bush 's reaction to his father 's presidency . The younger Bush was a political aide in his father 's White House . From a front-row seat , he watched with horror as aides leaked and double-crossed to get rid of chief of staff John Sununu ( even as he joined in the plotting ) . " I 'm sure he was informed by the experiences he saw when his dad was president , " Bush 's current chief of staff , Andy Card , told NEWSWEEK . " And that 's one reason why he has confided in me . " ( Card was a rare Bush 41 staffer who did not backstab . ) Much is said about Bush 's premium on loyalty , but the key word is trust . Like Robert De Niro 's ex CIA officer in " Meet the Parents , " Bush has a very small circle of trust . From his days as a small oil businessman , Bush believes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when former German chancellor Gerhard Schroder promised that he would stick with Bush on Iraq  --  and then won re-election in 2002 by campaigning against the run-up to the war . <p> Bush 's real friends are his old Texas and school buddies from Andover , Yale and Harvard Business School . He calls them all the time  --  but the talk is usually comforting and jocular , of sports and old days . They rarely dispense pointed political advice or brace him with bad news . Chief of staff Card is widely described by insiders as a decent and honorable man , but also as a family retainer who tells the president what he wants to hear . Exhausted by predawn arrivals at the White House , Card is expected to step down soon ( though he denies the rumors that he wants to replace Treasury Secretary John Snow ) . The lead candidates to replace Card are all loyalists , like OMB Director Josh Bolten , or Bush 's old confidant and former Commerce secretary Don Evans ( who is lukewarm about working full time in Washington ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and independent-minded figures . Because they were at the end of their careers , with no office left to seek , Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld were seen as liberated to call things the way they saw them . But the headstrong Cheney and Rumsfeld seemed to almost relish scoffing at dissent . <p> Cheney in particular has acted as Bush 's unofficial prime minister , playing a heavy hand in the war on terror and handling ( or often mishandling ) Hill relations . Though a former congressman himself , Cheney disdains Congress almost on principle : he believes the balance between executive and legislative power went out of whack after Watergate , and he has done his best to strengthen White House prerogatives . Cheney 's bungling of the dicey issue of torture is a case in point . <p> When Sen. John McCain passed a Senate resolution by a vote of 90-9 to ban the " cruel , inhumane and degrading " treatment of detainees , Cheney , a former member of the House intelligence committee , went to Capitol Hill to carve out an exception for CIA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cheney privately made the case to a group of GOP senators that " enhanced interrogation methods " work to extract necessary information from terrorists . The senators were unimpressed . Talking to NEWSWEEK afterward , McCain waxed confident that he " could get 90 votes again tomorrow . " Since then , Bush 's national-security adviser , Steve Hadley , has been gingerly negotiating with McCain for some face-saving compromise . The president is in a box : he can ill afford to make his first veto ever of a bill banning torture . <p> Bush was getting pushed to compromise by his secretary of State , Condoleezza Rice , who privately argued that Bush did not want his legacy to be a policy of torture . Some Washington observers believe that Rice , who  --  was frequently rolled by the hard-line hawks Cheney and Rumsfeld in the first term , is feeling empowered by her new role at State to take a stronger  --  and more moderate and internationalist  --  position in Bush 's War Cabinet . But one former Bush 41 administration figure who knows her well ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says of Rice 's apparent evolution , " Do n't read too much into it . Condi is not a neo-con . But she 's not Colin Powell , either . " <p> On the overriding issue facing the president  --  the war in Iraq  --  some reality has slowly crept in . Last spring Cheney was still whistling past the graveyard , describing the Iraqi insurgency as in its " last throes . " Since then , Bush 's ambassador to Iraq , Zalmay Khalilzad , has tried to educate the president and his top advisers on some " ground truth "  --  that the new Iraqi Army and police are a long way from being able to defend their own country and nascent government . According to senior Pentagon officials who did not want to be identified discussing private meetings , in October Bush received an unusually unvarnished briefing on the military situation from the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Marine Gen. Peter Pace . <p> What Bush actually hears and takes in , however , is not clear . And whether his advisers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president is also questionable . Take Social Security , for example . One House Republican , who asked not to be identified for fear of offending the White House , recalls a summertime meeting with congressmen in the Roosevelt Room at which Bush enthusiastically talked up his Social Security reform plan . But the plan was already dead  --  as everyone except the president had acknowledged . Bush seemed to have no idea . " I got the sense that his staff was not telling him the bad news , " says the lawmaker . " This was not a case of him thinking positive . He just did n't have any idea of the political realities there . It was like he was n't briefed at all . " ( Bush was not clueless , says an aide , but pushing his historic mission . ) <p> In subtle ways , Bush does not encourage truth-telling or at least a full exploration of all that could go wrong . A former senior member of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Baghdad occasionally observed Bush on videoconferences with his top advisers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have what you need to complete the mission ? ' as opposed to saying , ' Tell me , General , what do you need to win ? ' which would have opened up a whole new set of conversations , " says this official , who did not want to be identified discussing high-level meetings . The official says that the way Bush phrased his questions , as well as his obvious lack of interest in long , detailed discussions , had a chilling effect . " It just prevented the discussion from heading in a direction that would open up a possibility that we need more troops , " says the official . <p> Bush generally prefers short conversations  --  long on conclusion , short on reasoning . He likes popular history and presidential biography ( Theodore Roosevelt , George Washington ) , but by all accounts , he is not intellectually curious . Occasional outsiders brought into the Bush Bubble have observed that faith , not evidence , is the basis for decision making . Psychobabblers have long had a field day with the fact that Bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepting God . His close friends agree that Bush likes comfort and serenity ; he does not like dissonance . He has long been mothered by strong women , including his mother and wife . A foreign diplomat who declined to be identified was startled when Secretary of State Rice warned him not to lay bad news on the president . " Do n't upset him , " she said . <p> Bush is never going to be a JFK who would hold glittery state dinners and use them to tease out new ideas and fresh thinking from different sources ( and , it should be added in JFK 's case , fresh gossip and romantic conquests ) . Bush has held four state dinners in five years and made clear his preference for going to bed at 10 . Ken Duberstein , Reagan 's last chief of staff and a whiz at congressional relations , recalled that when Nancy Reagan traveled , the president did not like to dine alone . So Duberstein would bring in seven or eight congressmen for dinner , and Reagan would tell his jokes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tip ) O'Neill over for his birthday . Finally , Duberstein recalled , an aide had to step in and say , " It 's time for you guys to go back to running the government . " Bush prefers to flip on ESPN or go to Camp David for the weekend with Card and Harriet Miers , his trusted White House counsel ( and failed Supreme Court nominee ) . <p> BUSH , TOO , CAN BE FUNNY ; his humor is Preppy Putdown , not gentle and corny , if sometimes off-color , like Reagan 's . " It 's the difference between Eureka and Yale , " says an old Reagan hand . It 's also a matter of confidence . Reagan knew he was the best entertainer in the room . To be sure , Bush can be self-deprecating . Joking about his Council on Foreign Relations speech , Bush suggested to his speechwriters that , as a gag , he should hold up a copy of Foreign Affairs , the council 's worthy , dry publication , and say , " I tried to read it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't enough pictures . " ( Bush decided against using the quip , considering the speech too much of a serious event . ) But humor is a tool and sometimes a weapon for Bush . " He uses humor to disarm people and get a read on them , " said a senior aide who would n't be identified talking about his boss . " You can tell a lot about a person in how they react to a joke . " <p> During Bush 's first term , his attitude toward Congress was " my way or the highway , " according to a GOP staffer who did not want to be identified criticizing the president . " If you were lucky , you got to talk to him as you were taking a picture with him at a party , " says Rep. Ray LaHood , an Illinois Republican . " It was nothing . " Lately , however , Bush has been inviting congressmen up to the family residence at the White House to drink sodas and snack on peanuts or cookies . Bush talks , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very engaged , " says Rep. Peter King , Republican of New York . <p> He has to be . Congressmen from his own party have been in open rebellion . At their annual leadership retreat at a luxury resort overlooking the Chesapeake Bay two weeks ago , senior congressmen tore into White House aides Card and Counselor Dan Bartlett . The normally mild-mannered Speaker Dennis Hastert , who usually likes to operate behind closed doors , announced to the group , which included staffers as well as members , that the White House had " blown it " when it came to handling congressional relations . There was still incredulity over the Murtha outburst demanding a troop withdrawal from Iraq . " They should have seen that coming like a freight train , " said a top Republican . " In any White House the cardinal rule is no surprises , " said Duberstein . " I was somewhat surprised , I admit , " Card told NEWSWEEK . At the retreat , the Hill Republicans told the White House to do a better job of selling economic progress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rose Garden to spin good news on the economy . <p> Now the White House is trying to reach out to Democrats . On Tuesday , Bush is scheduled to meet with a group of conservative Democrats who support the war and to have lunch with Rep. John Dingell of Michigan , who is celebrating his 50th year in the House . But the Democrats are wary . " A lot of us feel like we have a Char-lie Brown and Lucy relationship with the White House , " says one Hill staffer . " They say they want to play ball with us , but then they kick us when they get a chance . " Until recently , the White House has not seen the need to court Democrats , since the Republicans control both houses of Congress . <p> Democratic Sen. Joseph Lieberman has been pushing for a bipartisan " war council " that could advise the president on strategy . The Washington rumor mill has suggested Lieberman as a replacement for Rumsfeld . Friends of Rumsfeld 's say he has no intention of stepping down . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would send a powerful signal that the days of the almighty Cheney-Rumsfeld axis were over . But do n't hold your breath . " There is this enormous pressure to change , but he 's going to resist that , " says a longtime adviser . " He wants solid people who do n't over-respond in a crisis . " That was the approach Bush took after his devastating defeat in the New Hampshire primary in 2000 . " The conventional wisdom after New Hampshire was to drop the team and start over , " says a senior White House aide . " But he brought the team in and said : ' Let 's go down to South Carolina and kick some butt ' . " <p> THE LEADER OF BUSH 'S political team was Karl Rove . Although his legal problems are not over in the Valerie Plame leak case , Rove has been upbeat and around town again , reportedly full of ideas for the next three years . Rove has succeeded in promoting Bush 's political fortunes by polarizing  --  by aiming at 51 percent and calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck abroad and stroking of Congress at home Bush can take advantage of the GOP majority in both houses to get some traction on tough issues ahead , like restoring fiscal discipline . If the economy stays strong and Iraq does n't fall apart , the GOP can hang on to Congress in 2006 ( and thus in 2007 avoid a blizzard of subpoenas from Democratic-controlled committees wanting to investigate questions like whether the administration lied about WMD in Iraq ) . Yet it will be hard to please congressmen while cutting their pork barrel , and as usual , no one seems very eager to cut middle-class entitlement programs . Big changes that require vision and sacrifice  --  like an energy and conservation program to reduce dependency on Middle East oil  --  do not appear to be on the drawing board . <p> True mandates for hard choices come from reaching out and compromising . Bush 's father understood that . Breaking his own " read my lips " promise at the 1988 Republican convention , he raised taxes in 1991 as part of a fiscal-reform package that was essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost the senior Bush a second term in 1992 .
