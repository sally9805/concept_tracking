After a buildup of Hollywood proportions , Microsoft released the final cut of its latest operating system upgrade , Windows XP . So is XP worth all the hype ? Grudgingly , we say yes . This major upgrade at long last ends the distinction between the consumer-oriented ( Windows 95/98/Millennium Edition ) and the corporate ( Windows NT/2000 ) operating systems . Instead , Microsoft provides similar variations of the same OS for both home and business : XP Home and XP Professional editions . On the outside , XP looks radically different from any previous Windows version . It 's spiffier , with both aesthetic and functional redesigns , and features login screens for home and corporate systems alike-something many Windows 95/98 users have never seen . And thankfully , installing Windows XP will involve less guesswork than previous versions . Microsoft even plans to release a compatibility checker called Upgrade Advisor that you can download or get on CD from computer retailers . Upgrade Advisor will check system-level software and hardware drivers against a database of compatible products and warn you of any possible problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Windows OS , then you 're probably used to entering a lengthy CD key , or code . But if you buy XP off the shelf , you 'll go through another compulsory step called activation . ( Most PC vendors who preinstall XP will have completed this task for you . ) Activation is n't the same as registration ( which asks you to provide personal info to Microsoft ) , but you must complete activation within 30 days of installation or the OS will stop working . While we understand this security measure , it 's an annoying roadblock . The activation scheme checks the IDs of 10 hardware components to create a special code for your PC . If your computer 's hard drive dies or you change your network interface card or reconfigure more than five of these components in your system , you 'll have to reactivate your copy of XP . Reactivation is a relatively painless process in which you must call Microsoft , explain your situation , and get a new activation number-not difficult , but it could prove annoying , and there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a software error . New Look and Feel Once activated , however , Windows XP looks a lot better than-and very different from-any previous version . It presents login buttons for each of your PC 's users-a look that owes a lot to MSN Internet Explorer 's interface . Click your name ( and enter an optional password ) , and XP whisks you off to a screen with rounded , 313  --  looking taskbar and dialog boxes . By default , only the Recycle Bin icon shows up on the clean desktop . ( You can , however , elect to view a 95-style desktop if you switch to the Windows Classic view . ) In the Start menu , XP renames the Windows 95/98 Find feature Search ( as it 's called in Windows Me ) . Those who understand wildcard searching can still opt to use it , but Search serves up many innovative handholding tricks . It asks a question ( " What do you want to search for ? " ) and lets you search under plain-English categories such as " Pictures , music , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc . ) . " Digital Media XP also has a new term for the stuff we used to call multimedia : digital media . Indeed , XP handles all kinds of digital media , including video , still pictures , and music , with aplomb previously lacking in Microsoft operating systems . XP even has native support for burning CD-Rs and writing to RW disks , and in general , it works better with removable devices . // Microsoft Windows XP // Windows XP boasts a vastly improved autoplay capability . First introduced in Windows 95 , autoplay automatically launched audio CDs and CD-ROM titles when they were loaded into the drive . As soon as XP determines the media type or source , be it a digital camera or a blank CD-R , up pops a dialog box listing the associated programs , such as a DVD player or editing application . Make the appropriate selection , and Windows XP loads it . Check off the option , and XP will repeat the action every time you load that medium . The revamped Windows Media Player for Windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wo n't rip to M format without a third-party add-on ( which you must buy separately ) . You can add lyrics to Windows Media Audio ( WMA ) and M files using standard ID3 , or metadata , tags , and display CD album art as you play tracks . Unfortunately , Media Player relies on All Music Guide ( AMG ) for the track listings . Gracenote 's rival CDDB , which is favored by other jukebox software , offers more complete and accurate data . XP 's built-in CD burner is a big plus and eliminates the need for third-party packages such as Easy CD Creator  --  providing that your CD-burning desires are simple . But it wo n't design jewel case inserts and disk labels , and the wizard hides certain settings , such as those for controlling your drive 's burn speed ( you can change the speed by using Windows Explorer ) . And its handling of UDF-formatted RW disks ( such as those created by Roxio 's DirectCD ) is confusing . Windows can read DirectCD-formatted disks , but it ca n't write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add data to them under Windows XP Internet and Networking Windows XP gives center stage to the Internet , beginning with its setup routine . Before the installer even begins , XP asks to check online for any updates . After the check , XP offers networking wizards galore , plus remote-control tools and a built-in firewall . And , of course , there 's the new Internet Explorer 6 . Given XP 's Net  --  dependence , you 'll get the most out of this OS if you 're blessed with highspeed access such as DSL or cable . Windows XP uses streamlined wizards to configure Internet and local networking settings , and they 're certainly a big improvement for home users and pros alike . The Network Setup wizard starts with a basic checklist of things you need to do before starting out ( such as configuring a LAN , installing network cards and cabling , and turning everything on ) and walks you through the rest . Using simple default settings , we hooked up PCs running XP Home and Professional editions to an existing network , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Windows Me PCs . The entire process went off without a hitch , and we were finished in less than half an hour . If you 're ambitious , you can network much more with XP . The networking wizard detects whether you 're on a gateway computer , one that connects the rest of a network to the Internet , and will set up connection sharing automatically ( if you approve the idea ) . XP also supports network bridging , a complicated business that connects different networking standards such as Ethernet and 802.11b wireless networking on a single PC . XP 's wireless support is greatly improved over previous versions ; it automatically detects and configures many 802.11b interface cards without fuss . Wider Windows Messenger Once you 're online , Windows XP jumps on you to sign up for Passport , a free online proof-of-identity scheme that Microsoft uses to verify your identity for Hotmail , online chat accounts , and electronic commerce . The bait to lure you to the Passport den is the new Windows Messenger  --  a beefy revamping of the wimpy MSN Messenger instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a separate download ) adds serious conferencing tools on top of the regular typed-chat windows . Messenger also adds two-way audio and video , application sharing ( in which your chat buddy views and controls programs on your PC ) , and whiteboarding ( the ability to share freehand drawings and other graphics ) . Messenger even integrates with Remote Assistance , a feature that lets you yield control of your system to a friend ( with enough password protection and time limitations to allay any fear of hacking ) . Windows Messenger shares contact lists and a backend network with MSN Messenger , but it does n't work with Microsoft 's existing conferencing software , NetMeeting . A Sense of Security Worried about hackers ? You 're smart , not paranoid . Automated scripts continually probe computers on the Internet for back doors , and Windows XP is doing something about it . Windows XP features a software firewall to block stealthy hack attacks on your network connections , dial-up and broadband alike . XP 's Internet Connection Firewall makes your PC invisible while you 're on the Net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viruses over e-mail or through a hacked Web site . Enable the firewall at the Networking control panel for each of your possible connections . ( If you have separate AOL and broadband connections , for example , you must turn on the firewall for both. ) // HOW WE TESTED CNET Labs Tests Windows XP APPLICATION PERFORMANCE CNET Labs tested XP 's application performance using BAPCo 's SysMark 2001 benchmark . SysMark 2001 consists of two applications , Internet Content Creation and Office Productivity , and it runs actual workload scenarios at realistic execution speeds . SysMark 2001 assigns a performance rating for each scenario ( Office Productivity and Internet Content Creation ) and calculates the geometric mean of those scores to come up with an overall rating . We ran the benchmark on these systems : 1.5GHz Pentium 4 , 1.4Ghz Athlon . According to CNET Labs ' tests , XP was the performance winner of three of our five configurations . On our Pentium 4 system , XP was only one point behind Windows 2000 . Windows Me performed the worst on most of our configurations . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historically performed slower than 2000. // We evaluated the firewall by visiting Gibson Research 's site , which tests computer ports for vulnerabilities by using Shields Up and a variety of other security-probing Web programs . The results were encouraging : The site detected the IP address of our test system ( not unusual even with hardware firewall products ) , but XP stealthed , or completely obscured , all of our networking ports . By concealing these virtual back doors , XP 's firewall prevented most forms of script-based hack attacks . Hardware and Software Compatibility Microsoft has admitted that Windows 2000 and NT suffered from huge hardware and software compatibility flaws . It paid for this failure , too : Windows 2000 never really worked with consumer hardware and games . Fortunately , Windows XP fixes much of that problem . The XP CD ships with built-in support for about 12,000 devices-twice as many as Windows 2000 right out of the box-with other drivers available via the System Update feature , which downloads drivers as part of the installation process . In our tests , formal and informal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from USB storage devices and keyboards to M players . In some cases , however , we were n't so lucky . XP flagged a newer Lexmark X83 multifunction device as incompatible , so we 're holding out for online updates . Home vs . Professional Windows XP comes in two flavors with two different price tags : Home Edition ( $99 upgrade ; $199 full version ) and Professional Edition ( $199 upgrade , $299 full edition ) . Professional Edition packs in all of Home Edition 's features , plus some corporate-strength capabilities that administrators and the security-conscious may want . But almost anyone else , including many small-business proprietors , will actually prefer the Home Edition . Professional 's big draw is its corporate-level system administration-which requires official , corporate system administrators-and robust disk- and IP-based encryption . If these features are n't important to you , then save yourself $100 and go for the Home Edition . You 'll find more variations under the surface of these two editions . Professional Edition offers extra features that will appeal to those upgrading from Windows 2000 Professional  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporate setups . These features include about 300 new administrative and group policies ( new since Windows 2000 Professional ) , including one that lets system administrators redirect the contents of My Documents to a network server for security and backup . XF Pro also boasts roaming user profiling ; you can sit at any computer on your company 's local area network and log on to your personal system , with access to all of your and documents . In the security arena , XP Professional includes the Encrypting File System for disguising sensitive data . This feature , introduced in Windows 2000 Professional , lets Windows NT file system-based disks scramble data stored on their hard disks for added security-a big plus for laptop users who dread losing trade secrets if their laptops get stolen . Like any radical overhaul , XP takes some getting used to , but it 's hard not to like the new design . While its novice-friendly features may exasperate experienced users , Microsoft nevertheless managed to create an OS that works equally well for families , corporate users , and enthusiasts . Despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 128MB of RAM , and 1 . SGB of free disk space ) , onerous product activation , and some obvious touting of Microsoft 's business partners , you 'll want to consider the upgrade-if not immediately , certainly the next time you buy a PC. // Faster Boot Times Based on our tests , Windows XP boots significantly faster than Windows 2000 . With optimizations to the Boot Loader , OS Load , and Device Initialization processes , XP booted twice as fast as Windows 2000 on three of the five systems we tested . Windows XP booted as quickly as Windows Me in most of our tests . Sidebar CNET REVIEW RATING OUT OF 10 Sidebar THE GOOD : Streamlined interface ; better performance on many systems ; easier and more capable networking ; integrated CD R/RW playback and burn features . THE BAD : You can install XP on only one machine ; nags you to sign up for Passport Web account ; heavy system requirements . THE BOTTOM LINE : Despite its many annoyances , XP is a worthwhile upgrade .
