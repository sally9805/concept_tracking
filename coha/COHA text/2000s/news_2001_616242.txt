<p> Eddy Curry looks forward to Saturday mornings , when he rises early to watch cartoons . If he comes home late , his father takes away the car keys . He sleeps in the soft glow of a night light . <p> Say whassup to another diapers-to-dollars basketball player , among the latest XXtra-tall teens whom the NBA insists it does n't want right away but ca n't wait to get . <p> The man-child from Chicago is expected to shake NBA commissioner David Stern 's hand soon after the draft commences on June 27 , thus fueling the annual debate : Should someone who chuckles at Scooby Doo and defines being well-grounded as confined to the house for breaking curfew be exposed to the harsh glare of the NBA spotlight ? Speaking of Looney Tunes , the draft waiting room will be sprinkled with plenty more kids going directly from the prom to the pros . At least six hopeful high schoolers , an unprecedented number , will scale the sport 's faith hill , with more possible up to the midnight deadline for declaring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The unofficial two-year minimum on campus has crumbled , a record five freshmen having enlisted for the draft . ( Unlike the real young'uns , the college guys can climb out of the pool by June 20 provided they do n't hire an agent . ) <p> The juvenile jumping has everyone in a tizzy . College hoops is wringing hands over its destiny , with the most pessimistic fearing that constant turnover , reduction of star power and rise in recruiting costs spell doom . The NBA frets that a flood of unprepared rookies , physically and emotionally , will water down the product . Others bemoan the loss of innocence , the demise of paying one 's dues or the detour around campuses that deny players the proverbial " best years of their lives . " <p> Face it : Ai n't no stopping ' em now , not without fundamental alterations to the system , none of which is on the horizon . Before long , you might have trouble differentiating a snapshot of the NBA draftees from a high school graduating class photo . <p> One common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass-is-greener theory , green being the color of money . Not necessarily . Curry hails from a middle-income family . Tyson Chandler of Compton , Calif. , drives a Cadillac Escalade , which goes for about 50 grand . ( Maybe he 's behind on the payments . ) <p> Four years ago , Dion Glover , from a household with two working parents , roomed at a prep all-star game with Tracy McGrady , who was about to go ninth in the NBA draft . An All-American himself out of Cedar Grove High in south DeKalb County who was bound for Georgia Tech , Glover asked his bunkmate why . <p> " It was n't about money , " Glover says . " He talked about his dream  --  the dream of all of us . He said , ' I got a chance to get to my dream now . ' That 's playing basketball full time . " <p> In Toronto , it was a dream deferred as McGrady squirmed in the shadow of Vince Carter . But this season in Orlando , he was the man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today 's kids in high-tops assume that they must serve an NBA apprenticeship no matter when they enter . So , the thinking goes , why not get it out of the way as soon as possible ? <p> Garnett paved the way <p> Credit the youth movement to , or blame it on , pioneer Kevin Garnett , the first modern-era kid to cast his lot in 1995 . ( The baby boomer generation had a three-man kiddie corps  --  Bill Willoughby , Moses Malone and Darryl Dawkins . ) Part of a new breed of player , Garnett had a center 's height ( 6-foot-11 ) , a forward 's body ( 220 pounds ) and a guard 's agility . Within four seasons , he was all-pro . <p> The next draft crop brought Kobe Bryant , all-NBA in his third year , and Jermaine O'Neal , who needed five seasons to plant himself in the lineup . These are the players , not Shane Battier , who stare down from posters on boys ' bedroom doors . <p> " With Garnett and Kobe and Jermaine , ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's why so many are coming out now , " Glover says , while acknowledging the washouts as well , such as Korleone Young ( Detroit , 1998 ) and Leon Smith ( San Antonio to Dallas , 1999 ) . " There 's talented kids out there . If they can do it , they should do it . " <p> With the growth of summer camps and prep all-star outings , the elite are afforded repeated opportunities to rate themselves against peers . And , if one leapfrogs to the NBA , those who held their own against him in the gym are compelled to consider it . <p> DerMarr Johnson could not even wait for his diploma . The Hawks rookie wanted to bolt after his junior high school season , never mind that rules forbid it . " I was , like , at least you could wait until your senior year , " says his friend , Glover , laughing at the memory . So Johnson stopped off at the University of Cincinnati for a cup of cappuccino , with all parties aware of the one-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson wrote in a diary . " The NBA was where I wanted to be . " <p> The trend has spawned a subgroup of players like Johnson who do college against their wishes , with scant interest in schoolwork . Garnett acknowledged he was less interested in higher education than higher tax brackets and proceeded directly to the pros . Last month , the Los Angeles-area center Jamal Sampson confessed that his NBA flirtation stemmed from the fact that he is n't " really into school . " How must prestigious California-Berkeley feel now that Sampson has since decided to attend ? <p> And what about Ousmane Cisse and De Sagana Diop ? Both are intelligent , but having recently emigrated from West Africa , Cisse from Mali in the summer of ' 98 and Diop from Senegal a year later , they have had to master a new language at the same time as the drop-step . <p> Curry and Chandler are first-round cinches , Cisse and Diop likely . More power to them , says Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban , who pooh-poohs the old-school notion that everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player can get drafted in the first round , he is crazy not to go to the NBA , " Cuban says by e-mail , his preferred mode of interview . " Name one other profession where you can get the chance to get paid and work with the best in the world and . . . it would be a bad thing . " <p> College stays shortening <p> The greater threat to the college game is the one-and-done approach , with freshmen using the campus as a mere finishing school for the NBA . It interrupts continuity and can cause inner turmoil . Witness the Seton Hall locker room fight between Eddie Griffin , an exiting college rookie who is projected by some as the No. 1 draft pick , and a senior who felt Griffin was not subscribing to a team concept . <p> Two of the five fleeing freshmen , Zack Randolph of Michigan State and Gerald Wallace of Alabama , could not even crack the lineup . Same with Florida 's Donnell Harvey last year and Duke 's Corey Maggette the season before . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , " Michigan State coach Tom Izzo says . " Now it seems that if they do n't go after their first or second year , it 's a test of their manhood and they 're failures . That 's ridiculous . " <p> Yet it 's the way things are , says Glover . " You grow up with guys ( who turn pro early ) and you see yourself equal . " <p> Glover , 6 feet 5 , was not in the same demand as the prospects cut from the taller Garnett mold . But he considered himself NBA ready after a year at Tech . <p> " I was real close " to leaving , he said , until his father , Franklin , persuaded him otherwise . " He said I needed more maturity . " <p> In Tech 's first practice the following fall , Glover tore the ACL in his right knee , wiping out the season . " I was devastated , " he says . " I cried . " Again , Dad 's advice conflicted with his own thinking : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm saying to myself , ' Dad , people have n't seen me play for a year , ' " Glover says . " I wondered why a general manager or owner would take a chance on someone they did n't know was healthy or how their game was . " <p> But in the Glover household , father knows best . Dion " tossed and turned " through the nights leading up to the deadline before ultimately abiding by his father 's words : " You got ta have faith . " <p> The Hawks did have faith in him , selecting Glover 20th overall . His three-year contract , guaranteed , is worth about $2.9 million , enough to enable his parents to quit their jobs , to buy them a new home ( he lives in the basement ) , to indulge himself with an Escalade and a Mercedes and to support his 2-year-old , Micaiah . <p> Glover remembers missing suppers at the Tech cafeteria and not having enough coin to eat out . He would summon his mother to bring food  --  or go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he admits , but not enough to where he regrets checking out after one season . <p> Subsidies <p> If colleges could subsidize athletes , even with as little as $200 a week , more of them would stay longer , Glover maintains . <p> Mark Cuban 's solution : Grant players a mulligan , allowing them to return to college after the draft , even if they have hired an agent . <p> " Agents can be very misleading or misinformed , " he says . " If a player is victim of this , then the NCAA rubs it in and destroys the player 's future to teach him a lesson . If a student had a chance to land a job with an accounting firm or as the first violinist of an orchestra , we would let them go for one month , one year or six years and let them return to all their activities , even sports . " <p> Ideas for stopgap measures have been floated . Make the NBA like a nightclub and card players as they enter , with under-20s denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get some court time . Set contract lengths based on years of college service , rewarding the student-athletes . <p> But , with nothing imminent , a high school doubleheader in California will continue to draw 42 NBA scouts and general managers , and pro personnel will outnumber fans in the gym at Oak Hill Academy in remote Virginia . <p> Glover hears those proposals and concludes , " Keep it the way it is . " He cites golf , tennis and other sports as being more acceptable of the teen movement . " Why put stipulations on basketball ? " <p> " No question those make sense as an owner , " Cuban says . " But if I am to be objective and look at it from the players ' perspective , I would tell anyone who can get drafted in the first round and get three years of guaranteed money , they are crazy not to .
