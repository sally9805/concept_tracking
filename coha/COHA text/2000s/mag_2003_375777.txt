Americans struggling to find work , get a decent pay raise or buy a home must marvel at the peculiar worries of Bill Gross . A legendary investor , Gross runs the $76 billion Pimco Total Return bond fund . In recent weeks he has sold $6 billion in Treasury bonds , activity that has contributed to a sharp rise in mortgage interest rates . Gross , though , is more concerned about bad things that might happen in the future , not what 's happening now . " Two or three years down the road , " he says , " inflation might be a real pressure cooker . " <P> The prospect of a runaway economy complete with nasty inflation is unfathomable to a battered labor force more focused on getting or keeping jobs in the current climate . But Gross and other bond investors get paid to look far ahead , take their best guesses and place their bets accordingly . In the process , they exert near total control over the rate you pay when borrowing to buy a house , car or toaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bond market , not by the Federal Reserve , which dictates short-term rates . Bond traders sell when they anticipate a pickup in inflation , which usually accompanies economic growth and erodes the value of their fixed interest payments . In the past two months , the selling has been heavy , and as a result the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has jumped from 5.25% to 6.37% . That move adds $143 to the monthly principal-and-interest payment on a $200,000 mortgage  --  all because Gross and his kind have had a change of heart and now figure the economic recovery is firmly on track . <P> To be sure , some economic indicators have been perking up , including stronger retail sales , corporate profits and manufacturing activity . But these could easily prove to be just a blip on the radar . After all , only weeks ago it was the D word  --  deflation  --  that was giving traders nightmares . Even Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has publicly fretted over the prospect of the country succumbing to a Japan-like malaise with falling prices , though he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the bond mavens ' expectations for a solid recovery is premature . Last Tuesday the Fed met and not only held its benchmark Federal Funds short-term rate at 1% ( a 45-year low ) but also took the unprecedented step of saying it would leave the rate there " for a considerable period . " The Fed hates to be boxed in . It desperately wanted bond investors to follow the lead . They did n't . A sell-off in Treasury bonds that began in June persisted , pushing bond prices down and yields up . The yield on the closely watched 10-year T-bond jumped to a 12-month high of 4.66% early Thursday before ending the week at 4.53% . As recently as June 13 , the yield was 3.11%.
