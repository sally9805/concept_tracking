<p> High on the rugged border between Kosovo and Macedonia , US Army Sgt. Donald Lindley sits in a clump of scrub oaks , peering through binoculars down onto the red-tile roofs of an abandoned village . He and his partner , Spc . Brendan Hagan , are spending the afternoon perched on this hillside , overlooking some of the most difficult terrain in Kosovo , watching for anything that moves . The soldiers are part of a platoon of 27 paratroopers from the Army 's 82nd Airborne Division . The Army moved them here 2-1/2 weeks ago as part of an effort to stop ethnic-Albanian fighters , and mules carrying munitions and food , from crossing into Macedonia . The Macedonian government has criticized the NATO-led peacekeepers in Kosovo for failing to close off the border sooner . The success - or failure - of platoons like this one to cut off supplies and rebel reinforcements could determine how long the unrest around Tetovo , Macedonia , goes on . Lt. Paul Grant , the tall , bespectacled platoon leader here , says his unit and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone that tries to pass through . In addition to this platoon , the US is supplying unmanned drones to fly over the hills of Macedonia , where government troops launched an offensive on Sunday . Rebels and hundreds of civilians fled villages around Tetovo . Some refugees , on arrival in Kosovo , claim they were fired on by Macedonian helicopter gunships . The soldiers at OP Bravo man lookout posts 24-hours a day . They conduct frequent patrols across the ridges and into the wooded valleys . Often , Grant says , they respond to radio reports from other outposts and from helicopters that hover over the border region looking for suspicious activity . " We have night vision . We have thermal imaging . We have soldiers out in the country day and night , " he says . " We see people all the time ... We 're quite adept at finding people out here . " The American outpost lies dozens of miles from the main fighting in Macedonia . But it is close to where the unrest started last month , in the remote mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small group of rebels and drove them out , together with the entire civilian population . Even now , the Americans occasionally hear the distant boom of artillery , or see the flash of a rocket launcher on a nearby hill , a sign that sporadic fighting continues in northern Macedonia . The Macedonian Army is close by . On a rock outcrop a third of a mile away , Macedonian snipers look down into Tanusevci - with orders , the Americans say , to shoot anything that moves inside Macedonia . The Americans often talk to the Macedonians over the radio , telling them when and where they are sending patrols , so they do n't get shot at . Three weeks ago , American soldiers engaged in a brief gunfight with five or six ethnic-Albanian rebels , who were using the school the Americans now occupy as a base . All but one , who was injured , got away . Since then , the Americans believe , their presence has for the most part discouraged ethnic-Albanian fighters from using this section of the border . But they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers intercepted a group of about 30 men working their way up a small valley a few miles east , according to Col. Bryan Owens , who led the patrol . The fighters scattered , but the Americans captured their equipment : five horses loaded with a variety of weapons , including bolt action rifles , AK-47s , sniper rifles , antitank mines , rocket-propelled grenades , and thousands of rounds of ammunition . " That was a large operation for them , " Colonel Owens says . " I think we set them back . " Owens says the rebels came from the town of Kacanik , about 10 miles away , and worked their way along the border region , picking up recruits . Some of the men were from Kosovo , Owens says , others from Macedonia . Tough terrain Army officials and soldiers in the field say they ca n't completely stop border traffic here , where there is a long history of smuggling . The valleys are steep and wooded , and interlaced with dirt tracks . But Army officials say that what they ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think we can shut it down , " says Col. Gene Kamena , deputy commander for maneuvers with American peacekeepers in Kosovo . " But by interdicting them , I think we 're changing their patterns . They know we 're out there . They 're not very comfortable right now . I want to make their lives miserable . " A Macedonian official , who asked not to be named , said the government was pleased with the efforts of the Americans and other units in the American sector . But he said fighters were still crossing the border in the German sector of southern Kosovo . The Germans are responsible for the part of Kosovo that borders the high mountains above the city of Tetovo , where most of the fighting has been centered . He said that 500 fighters had crossed the border in the past two weeks . The US Army is responsible for about 100 miles of border , almost equally divided between Serbia and Macedonia . It began to position soldiers along the Serbian border last spring , when an armed ethnic-Albanian group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American sector in Serbia proper . The new president of Yugoslavia , Vojislav Kostunica , has criticized NATO for not doing more to prevent ethnic-Albanian fighters from crossing that border . NATO responds In response , NATO has agreed to allow the Yugoslav Army into a three-mile zone along the border from which it was previously barred . Yugoslav units began to move into the zone last week . In Debelde , a village on the Kosovo side about half a mile back from the border , a teenager named Faik , who says he had fled from the Macedonian side of the border , pointed to a forested ridge about a half mile away . He says that until recently , ethnic Albanians used horses to take food and weapons through the forest into Macedonia . " It 's hard now to get food to the fighters , " he says . Until the border troubles began , the Americans had their hands full inside Kosovo . The American sector of the province still contains a large number of Serbs , who live under a continuing threat of violence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses , perhaps by ethnic Albanians who want to keep Serbs who have left Kosovo from ever returning . The US recently refused a NATO request to send more troops to Kosovo . Army officials say they have plenty to seal off the border and to keep peace within the province . But a Western diplomat in Macedonia says , " They do n't have the numbers that would allow them to do everything they would like to do . " Recently , NATO moved peacekeeping units from the British sector of Kosovo to help the Americans along the border . In the area of OP Bravo , between 100 and 150 soldiers keep watch on just nine miles of border , making it one of the better-watched segments . But sometime the terrain still defeats the Americans . One night last week , a squad was out patrolling when a helicopter radioed that it had spotted people moving along a valley more than a mile away . The soldiers hurried to intercept them . They never found them . " You 've got to be down there in the weeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's hard to move around at night . " Almost all the people they stop turn out to be civilians . Last Wednesday , Sergeant Lindley says , soldiers spotted people in Mijak from the lookout on the hill . He led a squad down the hill at a jog to confront them . By the time the soldiers got there , everyone was gone but one old man . " It turned out it was just some people getting potatoes . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2001 . The Christian Science Monitor
