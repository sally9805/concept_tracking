<p> There are no ploys from Marvin Harrison , no antic bids for attention , look at me , look at me , look at me . So , it may come as a surprise to learn that Harrison is the best wide receiver in the NFL , and perhaps on his way to being the best of all time , certainly better than any other wide receivers you have heard of , those garrulous self-promoters with their megaphone egos , and Klaxon mouths , and stage props hidden in their socks . Compared with him , those guys are insufferable bleaters . They are merely good . Harrison is great . <p> Harrison has pulled off a very neat trick : He has become great without becoming famous . He does not hold bawling news conferences , or strike ludicrous poses . He has been named to the Pro Bowl eight times and holds several NFL records yet he has passed through his 11-year career for the Indianapolis Colts without a single memorable end zone display or act of self-celebration . The result is that he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he is , " says Colts President Bill Polian , " but people do n't know it . " <p> A search for public mention of Harrison turns up almost nothing except his age , 34 , his vitals , 6 feet , 185 pounds , and some statistics . Which is the way he likes it . " That 's good , " Harrison says . " Nothing to write about . " Now , think about it . This is the age of communication , not to mention brazenness and blatant vulgarity . Do you know how hard it is to leave no real impression of yourself , nothing but a bunch of numbers and secondhand opinions ? <p> Harrison shrinks against a wall in the Colts ' complex , hands thrust deep in his gray fleece sweats , exuding an almost panicky shyness . With his slight build , he seems more fawn-like than human . He is all slim reticence . Startle him , say , by asking something personal , and he 'll bolt from the building . He constantly glances away , his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , Harrison does n't like being looked at . <p> " I 'd prefer to play in an empty stadium , " he says softly . " It would be , um , not less embarrassing , but I do n't like the focus directly on me , not anything , no one , no cameras . If I had to I would just play in front of no fans . " <p> Ask any pedestrian on the street to name the top wide receiver in the league , and he might pick Terrell Owens or Chad Johnson , notorious preeners . But ask defensive backs the same question , and you get a different answer . Indianapolis Coach Tony Dungy believes that the only people who properly appreciate Harrison are the people " who have to cover him . " Last winter , ESPN queried nine defensive backs : Who is the toughest player to cover in the league ? Eight answered : Marvin Harrison . <p> It 's the diminutive , semi-invisible Harrison who is on pace to break virtually every important receiving record in the NFL . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in league history , 149 games . His average of 94 catches per season is the all-time record  --  by nine . He holds the record for most receptions in a single season ( 143 )  --  by 20 . Heading into Sunday 's game against the Washington Redskins , he is ninth in the league in receptions with 32 . <p> So why have n't people heard more of him ? " Because he 's all substance , " says Dungy . " He 's not flash and dash , it 's just all performance for him . Even I really had no idea how good he was until I got here . " <p> In a 45-28 Monday night victory over the St Louis Rams last October , Harrison and quarterback Peyton Manning set the NFL record for touchdowns by a duo . They connected for their 86th score when Harrison , running a fade route , caught a lofted ball over his shoulder , planted his left foot , and dragged his right toe in the end zone . And then he jogged casually away . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tossed the ball to him . Manning handed the ball back . " You keep it , you keep it , you keep it , " Manning insisted . Harrison handed it back again . He would n't accept it . <p> " I 've just never been a flashy person , my work is the key to success , " Harrison said during an interview last season . " It 's not to go out and rant and rave about one touchdown in a game , when you still have 30 more minutes to play . My job is never done until all the zeros are on the clock . " <p> Humility ? Personal modesty ? They are all but obsolete qualities among NFL wide receivers  --  which is why quarterbacks on other teams openly pine to play with him . One of them is the Philadelphia Eagles ' Donovan McNabb , who was a collegiate teammate of Harrison 's for two years at Syracuse . " So many receivers go through their career talking about how great they are , and how much they 're going to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Only now and then does Harrison suffer a lapse in his habitual discretion . One moment came as the Colts trailed late in a game against Tennessee in 2003 . Harrison ran a deep post , into double-coverage . Manning threw , and Harrison made a diving , stretching , one-handed , laid-out grab for 42 yards , just short of the goal line . The Titans jumped around , screaming at the officials that it was n't a catch . Harrison calmly got to his feet  --  and waved his teammates down the field . A few moments later , the Colts scored the decisive touchdown for a 29-27 victory . <p> " That 's about as showy as he ever gets , " Colts center Jeff Saturday says . <p> He drinks juice . His sole idea of excess is a Tastykakes binge . For a while , Harrison kept a Tastykakes display next to his locker . It was the kind of thing you 'd see in a grocery store . <p> " That 's as wild as it gets for Big Marv , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Tastykakes , from his home town of Philadelphia , is what passes for personal information on Harrison , who guards his privacy closely . He is purposely inconspicuous in the Colts ' locker room , tending to keep to himself , and most of his teammates do n't know him well . His chair in front of his locker is usually empty  --  and when he 's in it , he sits facing inward , toward his locker , his back to the room . His fellow wide receiver Reggie Wayne jokes that if Harrison ever comes out of his shell he wants to be there with a camera . Even his offensive coordinator , Tom Moore , admits , " We do n't have a lot of conversation . " <p> Ask Dungy what makes Harrison tick , and he says : " That I do n't know . I really do n't know . It 's an interesting question . And you 'll never find out . " <p> If he has a good friend on the team , it 's Manning , or Freeney , who also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prizefights . But even Freeney seems to find Harrison fairly unknowable . <p> " Marvin is Marvin , there 's no guy like him , " Freeney says . " You may not even know he 's there . Outside of the football field , he 'll sneak by you . He 'll park his car in the middle of a shopping center , and no one would ever know . That 's Marvin . I would n't be surprised if Marvin was into one of those  --  what do you call ' em  --  things where you go into the wilderness , fishing and hunting , and being by yourself . He likes to do things different , and not necessarily what everybody else does . " <p> Harrison has intimates , but they tend to be childhood ones with whom he grew up in North Philadelphia . He shelters his family from the media and declines to provide much information about them , or a phone number for his mother . " I try to leave her out of it , " he says . Only grudgingly does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk for me , " he says . " Even if they think they know me , they do n't know me . So . That 's how I like it . " <p> Under prodding , he names his old high school geometry teacher , Joe Fararow , as a friend . He has also stayed close to an old high school classmate , Mike Watson , now a middle school teacher in Philadelphia . " He 's very shy and it 's kind of like you have to build that trust up in order for him to consider you a person of interest or a buddy , " Watson says . <p> Harrison is just three credits shy from acquiring his master 's degree in consumer affairs from Syracuse  --  but he wo n't say what he plans to do with it . Nor will he talk about his off-the-field interests . " I have tons , but I never discuss them , " he says . " Nothing people should know . " <p> His personal habits are apparently as modest as his on-field ones . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right Nike sneakers with the assigned Nike shirt . " He 's a neat freak , to be honest with you , " Watson says . " Everything 's got to be perfect . " His locker is almost military in its foursquare organization , shoes lined up on one shelf , and shoulder pads upright and centered on another . <p> He was born quiet , apparently . " I 've always been this way , " he says . But it 's also possible his unassuming demeanor is partly the result of early responsibility . His father Marvin Sr. died of natural causes when Marvin was 2 . His mother , Linda , raised him strictly while working two jobs . Homework was done the first thing after school , before anything else . Sunday was laundry and cleaning day . <p> " She only had to tell me something once , and I took care of whatever it was , " Harrison says . " Same thing as coach . He only has to tell me once . If I screw it up the first time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it again . " <p> Linda Harrison moved her family around Philadelphia , in search of better schools and after-school clubs , until they came to rest in Roxborough , a gentrified neighborhood with a famed recreational football program where Marvin began making his name as a prospect . She enrolled him in Roman Catholic High School , a grand old institution with a strict dress code and a record of sending its athletes to college . <p> Harrison wore his necktie and sweater to school and acquired a reputation for conscientiousness . He was never late , and missed one day of school in four years . He took a job cutting the grass at the Roman Catholic athletic fields to make extra money . " I think his mother raised him to be a well-mannered person , a respectable individual , and he kind of prides himself on that , " says Watson . <p> At Roman Catholic , Harrison came under the thumb of Fararow , the geometry teacher , and part-time director of a sports recreation center , who tutored promising athletes with collegiate potential . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Harrison that it was n't enough to be recruited ; he needed grades , too . He moved Harrison to the front row in his class , to make sure he had his attention . " You 're sitting on top of the world , " he said . " Do n't blow it . " <p> Harrison made decent grades , but he struggled with the SATs . The first time he took the standardized test , he failed to meet the NCAA 's requirements . If he could n't make a qualifying score , he would be academically ineligible as a freshman at Syracuse . One summer morning before his senior year , he showed up at the rec center where Fararow volunteered . " Will you help me ? " Harrison asked . <p> For the next few months , Harrison and his good friend Watson spent their lunch hours , four times a week , in private tutoring with Fararow . He would give Harrison articles from the local sports pages and make him read them . Harrison took the test a second time , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Fararow said . Harrison took the test a third time  --  this time on the morning of a big state tournament basketball game  --  and made his score . There is now a wall devoted to Harrison in Fararow 's geometry classroom at Roman Catholic . <p> There is a story Fararow enjoys telling about Harrison more than any other . It concerns one of the more legendary athletic feats Harrison ever performed , but it also defines his modesty , too . Roman Catholic had a sprinter named Mark Cobbs , who was widely acknowledged to be the fastest kid in the city . But anyone who watched Harrison streak around a football field knew he had close to 4.3-speed in the 40 , and suspected he might be faster than Cobb . A debate sprang up between the football players and the runners . Cobb issued a challenge . " At first Marvin just did what he does now , he did n't pay any attention to it , " Fararow says . <p> The track guys kept after him . " They just kept challenging him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all anyone could talk about was who the faster runner was . Finally , Harrison agreed to race , out of sheer weariness . <p> " All right , we can handle it , " he said . <p> The entire student body , along with teachers , filed out on to the sidewalk in front of the school , throngs of them crowding the corner of Broad Street and Vine . They stopped traffic , and marked out a sprint distance , 40 yards down the middle of the street . Students were betting their allowances , and lunch chits . <p> Harrison and Cobb lined up . And then they took off . <p> The track man never had a chance . In a 40-yard race , Harrison beat him by 15 yards . Then he walked away . They 're still talking about it at Roman Catholic . <p> Harrison , of course , did n't mention it again . <p> " That was really the beginning of Marvin , " Watson says . <p> Whenever Dungy runs into his old friend James Harris , the Jacksonville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same conversation . <p> " I do n't understand how the best receiver on your team gets wide open all the time , " Harris says . " Everybody knows he 's going to get the ball . How does he get wide open , with no one around him ? " <p> On each play , the defenders know Harrison is going to line up on the right side , because it 's where he 's always lined up . And on each play , they know he 's likely to be Manning 's featured target . " And he still has four or five plays in the game where nobody 's around him , " Dungy says . " It seems impossible . But that 's what he does , and he does it in such a way that he does n't draw attention to himself . " <p> Pure talent is one explanation . Harrison has explosion , guile , vision , hands and courage . Also , he has uncanny body control . He can disguise each route so they all look the same ; defenders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , curl , streak or comeback . By the time you figure out what he 's running , he 'll freeze you with a single shake of his shoulder , and then vanish . <p> " He 'll just run right past you and make you look stupid , " McNabb says . <p> A catalogue of Harrison 's catches includes pirouettes , twists , dips , twirls , lunges , tips , stabs and sleights of hand . <p> " What he does is so exceptional and so subtle that you ca n't see it unless you see it on film , " Polian says . " There are very few times when , with the naked eye , you will say , wow , how did he do that ? You only do that when you look at the tape . And then you say , ' My God , how did he do that ? ' " <p> As with all great magicians , the answer lies partly in practice . Behind every catch is hours of tedious rehearsal . Harrison practices the same way he comports himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on NFL draft day , Harrison sat with friends and family as he waited to see what team would pick him . In four years at Syracuse , Harrison had set the all-time receiving record , and he had legitimate hopes of going among the first 10 players chosen . Instead , team after team passed on him . <p> " I have to get a job , " Harrison kept saying to Fararow anxiously . " I have to get a job . I have to get a job . " <p> The class of ' 96 turned out to be a remarkable one for wide receivers , with 10 first-rate wideouts selected in the first or second rounds . But Harrison was only the 19th player chosen . Keyshawn Johnson went No. 1 , to the New York Jets . Terry Glenn went No. 7 overall , to the New England Patriots . Eddie Kennison was selected 18th , by the St. Louis Rams . <p> At last , the Colts called Harrison 's name . He was the fourth receiver picked . " He kind of has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But he will never say it . " <p> Whether out of insecurity , or because he 's never been properly appreciated , Harrison still labors at his position like a third-rate free agent desperate to make the team . His teammates shake their heads at his capacity for work and his obsessive attention to detail . <p> He insists on being the first player in every drill line . He wears gloves during games , but never during practice . The gloves are sticky and help him catch the ball  --  but he wants every disadvantage in practice . <p> He insists on reporting to the Colts ' Monday workouts . The practices are aimed primarily at those players who did n't get in the game , to give them some work . Nevertheless , Harrison is there , catching balls from the second- and third-team quarterbacks . If he does n't run a route right , or drops a certain pass , he 'll work on it obsessively , catching it 45 or 50 times in practice , making the ballboys throw to him until he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play , they pay me to practice , " he says . " Playing , that 's what you do for free . That 's what you do for fun . " <p> During regular midweek workouts , he insists on running his routes against Indy 's first-team defenders . He practices every route at game tempo , and when he makes a catch , he sprints it into the end zone as if the Super Bowl depends on it . His teammates report that he makes as many gasp-evoking catches in practice as he does on Sundays . <p> " Of all the great catches that ya 'll see in games , he does 10 times that many in practice , " says Manning . " It 's really gotten to the point where the one-handed catch in games , a lot of our guys go , ' Yeah , you know , he did that twice on Wednesday at practice . ' " <p> A defender , therefore , has to cope with two separate problems in covering Harrison . The first is to contain him . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are simply no breathers against him . <p> " I know that I 'm not going to take a play off , " Harrison says . " So for them , they got to be ready to play 60 snaps , every single time . And not only be ready to play 60 snaps , but I 'm going to run every route just as hard , and I 'm going to try to make them look all the same . " <p> There is one group of people , besides defensive backs , who properly appreciate Harrison : his teammates and associates . Dungy flatly calls him " priceless . " Polian has rewarded him with a contract worth $67 million over seven years , to ensure he finishes his career in blue and white . <p> Whether Harrison ever gets his due from others apparently does n't matter to him . It does n't seem to occur to him to ask for it , any more than it occurs to him to lead a parade in the end zone , or hold a circus on the sideline . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could play in an empty stadium , " in a way the stadium is empty to him . " <p> Harrison 's refusal to strut , or to share his inner life , is a statement in its own right . In a world of undignified shouting , Harrison is a whisperer . And in a league of exhibitionists , he resolutely maintains his humility and privacy . It 's tempting to wonder what he might be hiding . The answer is , nothing . " It 's almost like he 's a mysterious person , until you get to know him , and then you realize , what you see is what you get , " Watson says . A little prodding reveals that Harrison 's mysterious off the field activities really only consist of going home to Philadelphia , where he hangs out with the same old friends he grew up with . <p> " I mean , I live a normal life , " he says . " I just try to live a normal life , whatever that is . " <p> As for those closely held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoe drop . When Harrison retires , he will finish his masters . And then he 'd like to do something truly marvelous , and worthy of headlines . <p> He 'd like to become a schoolteacher.
