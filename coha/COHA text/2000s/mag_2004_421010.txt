THIS WORKOUT WILL GET RID OF STUBBORN POUNDS  --  GUARANTEED <p> At the mall one day , a woman bumps into an old friend and her new baby . Cooing over the stroller , she asks , " How old is he ? " <p> " Almost a year , " says the new mom , sheepishly . " And I 'm still straggling with these pregnancy pounds . " <p> Me too , sighs the woman . " Trouble is , my little one 's starting graduate school ! " <p> That could have been me ! Thankfully , my wake-up call came on my daughter 's 10th birthday , when I realized that she 'd lost her baby fat , but I had n't . Despite years of minding my diet and exercising faithfully , 10 lb still stuck to me like Velcro . <p> That 's when I decided to consult an exercise specialist . Fortunately , I worked with several  --  they 're the fitness editors at Men 's Health magazine ( Prevention 's sister publication ) . I showed them my exercise log @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slogging through the same workout for so long that I may as well have been sleepwalking . Then they replaced my old routine with the exercise equivalent of a loud , clangy alarm clock . In 6 months , those 10 lb were gone , and I have the firmest , leanest body of my adult life . <p> Whether you 're still battling those postpregnancy pounds or new ones that are making an appearance along with hot flashes , this plan is the answer to your 35+ weight loss woes . The results are fast and unmistakable : You 'll see them in the mirror , feel them in your clothes , value them in your soaring energy , and love them in the compliments you 'll receive . A Chronic Case of " Been There , Done That " <p> Small wonder my workout was spinning its wheels . I had n't changed my routine . in nearly 2 years : 30 minutes on the treadmill or stairclimber , followed by a high-rep , lightweight circuit through the weight machines . It was , in effect , exertion multiplied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no progress . In fitness parlance , I had plateaued . <p> I could see that I had stopped losing inches and pounds . But I was completely blinded to a far more serious health problem looming on the horizon . " As women age , loss of muscle mass is one of the greatest threats they face , " warns William Kraemer , PhD , a professor of exercise physiology at the University of Connecticut . Women in midlife trade up to 1 lb of neglected muscle for up to 2 lb of fat every year . That means there could be up to one less pound of lean body mass around to increase your metabolic rate , your body 's ability to burn calories , which explains why losing weight gets tougher as you get older . <p> This muscle-for-fat swap-called " creeping obesity " - is common as we grow older , says Kathryn Schmitz , PhD , a professor of epidemiology at the University of Minnesota . And extra fat puts you at more risk for deadly diseases such as heart disease , diabetes , and some types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it does n't have to happen . The Cure : A Wake-Up Call for Your Muscles <p> If you want to change your body for the better , change your workout . Often . That 's the core principle of periodization training . Vary the exercises you do and the order in which you do them ; the weight you use and the number of repetitions you lift ; even how often you exercise and how frequently you rest , and your muscles will soon thank you with increased strength and shape . <p> " A periodized resistance program keeps new stimulus in steady supply and steers you clear of plateaus , " says Men 's Health exercise advisor Michael Mejia , a certified strength and conditioning specialist in New York City . <p> Penn State researchers followed 24 women through a 6-month resistance training program . The multiple-set , periodized group lost 7% of their body fat and gained more than 7 lb of muscle . ( This is a good thing ! ) That was more than double the results of women doing a single-set routine , <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making you nervous , relax . You 've been losing muscle for years now , so in most cases , you 're just replacing what was once there ( back when you were younger and slimmer ) , Muscle is much more compact than fat , so those extra pounds will look sleeker , smaller , and firmer . And you wo n't bulk up . Your hormones wo n't let that happen . " Unless a woman eats an extra 500 calories a day and trains like an Olympian , she wo n't develop huge muscles , " says Mejia , whose clients include women as well as men . Mere mortal women will lose fat and get firm . <p> Better fat burning is n't the only benefit of a periodized resistance plan . " Most people have enough muscle mass to live an active life well into their 50s , " notes James Marx , PhD , an exercise researcher at Penn State . " Preserve that muscle with a periodized program , and you can maintain its healthy function for decades to come-even if you start training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Follow the weight training plan on pp. 162-167 . On alternate days , do at least 30 minutes of aerobic exercise such as walking , cycling , or kickboxing . <p> To determine how much weight you should be lifting , choose an amount that is difficult to lift on your last repetition . General guidelines for women are 5 to 10 lb for light weight workouts , 10 to 15 for moderate workouts , and 15 to 20 for heavy workouts . ( For men , 10 to 15 , 15 to 20 , and 20 to 25 , respectively . ) <p> If you 're new to weight lifting , start with a basic program : Do the light weight workout ( p. 164 ) , three times a week for 2 to 4 weeks , progressing from 1 to 3 sets of 12 to 14 reps each .
