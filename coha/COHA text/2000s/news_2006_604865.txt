<p> WASHINGTON  --  Jim Borck had just about given up on love . A divorced father of two , he was spending most of his free time volunteering at an animal shelter near his home in Lexington , Ky. , cleaning out the cages , running rescues , working to get pets adopted . <p> " I 'm not into the bar scene , not into singles groups and I never tried Internet dating , " he says . " I laughed about it when someone mentioned it . " <p> But Internet dating was about to change his life . <p> Borck , 33 , a service manager at a car dealership , was surfing online a year ago , stopping to look at dogs available at Petfinder.com , when an ad for another website , Animalattraction.com , caught his eye . <p> " I just thought I 'd throw myself on there and see what happens . " <p> What happened was Amanda Shimko , three hours away in Dayton , Ohio . <p> Just over half ( 50.2% ) of Americans under 35 who live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have pets , according to a 2001 survey by the American Veterinary Medical Association . And while some are happy being alone with their Fidos , many , like Borck , would like to share their dog 's life with someone . <p> Though pets bring people together at animal-friendly happy hours , in the aisles of pet stores and at trendy dog yoga classes , online dating is the newest , and some say most effortless , way for pet lovers to connect . <p> " I had five dogs , so it was going to take a certain kind of woman to be attracted to me , " Borck says . <p> Shimko , it turns out , was that kind of woman . The 28-year-old preschool teacher had seven dogs of her own . <p> She did n't respond at first , but Borck was persistent . He liked her profile , which was " 90% about her dogs and only 10% about herself , " though the fact that she shared his taste for green olives did n't hurt . <p> " I kept coming back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for someone who did n't have animals , but what 's the difference between five or 12 ? " <p> Not much , apparently . The two , who have been dating for a year , will be married April 1 . Their dogs will be in attendance . " We 're trying to make the youngest the ring bearer , a pillow strapped to our miniature whippet . " <p> They should also have Dan Cohen as their best man . <p> A couple of autumns ago , Cohen , a 37-year-old entrepreneur , was walking through the Adams Morgan neighborhood in Washington , D.C. , when he passed an outdoor cafe filled with people having a great time . <p> " But there was something about it that was a little different , " he says . " There were dogs . Lots of dogs . " <p> It was Cohen 's Eureka ! moment . Maybe dogs , long known as man 's ( and woman 's ) best friend , could also be man 's Cupid . Cohen launched his free website shortly after . Now there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : datemypet , lovemelovemypets , animalpeople , leashesandlovers and petloversconnection . <p> You do n't even need a pet to participate ; you just need to love them . " You do n't always want someone to come into a relationship with another pet , " Cohen says , because of the hassles of blending pet families . <p> You can be straight or gay , young or old , even a cat or hamster lover . The thousands who visit the website daily cover the spectrum . Based on recent activity , Cohen expects close to 1 million members by the end of the year . <p> Laura Hinson Miller , author of The Dog Dialogues ( yes , she converses with her dogs ) , met her husband , Todd , through Match.com , but their dogs opened the door . Pets are an asset she says more singles could use to their advantage : Just put the animal right out front . <p> " Both of our photos showed us with our dogs . That 's what instantly attracted me to him , " says Miller , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last March , and their blended Ojai , Calif. , family now has four dogs , five horses , a goat and a frog . <p> " There 's no way I would have dated him if he did n't like dogs , " says Miller , who knew she had caught a good man when " it did n't faze him at all that I talked to my dogs . " <p> Not that hooking up over pets does n't come with its own set of , well , standards . <p> Suzanne Todd , producer of Must Love Dogs , which has just arrived on DVD , says most everyone on the movie set had a dog story relating to the dating scene . <p> " But what was interesting was that it even got down to the type of dog . Some of the guys were n't attracted to women who had tiny yapping dogs , for instance . They 'd be more interested in someone with a golden retriever . They assigned a value to the dog . " <p> But like the date-seeking divorcee in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Just the words ' must love dogs ' is indicative of a certain kind of personality , " Todd says . " Some do and some do n't . " <p> Kim Saunders , a vice president at Petfinders , a pet adoption site , deals daily with those who do . <p> Saunders , who is single , just took the first step toward possibly finding a mate . She got a dog . " He 's a pit bull , about 10 months old , and he 's nothing but trouble . I named him Mojo for a little bit of Cajun appeal . <p> " I was n't looking for a man , " she says , " but I got one anyway . I 'm covered now . " <p> Cohen says it will be much easier for Saunders to find male companionship now . " It 's so easy just to say , ' Do you mind if I say hi to your dog ? ' If you own a pet , you ca n't be completely selfish , and people know that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love in the world of more exotic pets . <p> " A pet snake , for instance , forces you to go places where other people with pet snakes might be , " says Andrea Miller , founder and president of Tango , a lifestyle magazine for young women . " You 're finding people in their natural habitat , in a snake store looking for freeze-dried rat . " <p> Such exotic pets , Miller says , are " great personality indicators . It shows you 're maybe more adventurous , a little left of center . Pets telegraph who you really are . It 's a powerful way to connect . " <p> But nothing , perhaps , beats a tail-wagging dog as the ultimate ice breaker . <p> Marnie Hanel , a newly single New Yorker and an associate editor at Tango , took three dogs out to Central Park to see what happened and reported her findings in last October 's issue . <p> " With my canine chaperone beside me , I smiled at more strangers and gave men an excuse to approach me without seeming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone who has made the terrifying leap from one relationship to another knows , that 's the key  --  opening up , letting him approach . " <p> Gregg Oehler , publisher of The New York Dog magazine , sees it all the time . <p> " The dog runs in New York City have become the new singles bars . It 's gone into hyperdrive . And the best thing is you do n't have to dress up to impress anyone . You 're just there walking your dog . " <p> Before long , Oehler says , people are exchanging numbers and business cards . " I 've never seen anything like it , " he says . <p> Right after the terrorist attacks of 9/11 , Oehler attached an American flag to his dog 's leash . " I probably got stopped by 300 people who wanted their picture taken with my dog . " <p> He even met his last girlfriend " just out walking our dogs . " She and her dog became the cover of the magazine 's first issue . <p> The Doggie Happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Va. , has been bringing pet lovers together for seven years . <p> " Guys say it 's a great place to pick up ladies , " says Craig Luparello , the hotel 's food and beverage director . The party , held in the courtyard every Tuesday and Thursday from April to October , attracts up to 80 people . " And they all have one thing in common : their dogs . " <p> Lisa Berg , a single photographer in New York City , recommends the Great Lawn at Central Park ( between 81st and 85th ) as the place to meet other dog lovers every morning from 7 to 9 . <p> " It 's not so single-oriented , but people make great friendships there through their dogs , " says Berg , the owner of Bud , a yellow Lab . " It 's a start . " <p> Has Cohen been lucky in love  --  either on or off his own website ? <p> " Unfortunately , no , " he says .

Hollywood pet trainer Bash Dibra takes the use-your-pet dating game one step further . <p> In his book StarPet , Dibra instructs pet owners on how their dogs can perform tricks , not only to become " stars " in their adoring owner 's eyes , but also to attract the attention of a passing single . <p> " If you 're a guy , you tell your dog to sit up , wave , and as soon as she looks , just flip over , " says Dibra , who has a cult following among celebrity pet owners . " And then you say , ' He 's just crazy for good-looking girls . Can I have your number ? ' " PHOTO , B/W , Claudette Barius , Warner Bros . Pictures
