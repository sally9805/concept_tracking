Evidence of animal and possibly human sacrifice suggests that burials at Tell Umm el-Marra were those of Bronze Age royalty . <p> Although nearly seven years have passed , I still vividly remember the events of June 10 , 2000 . Our archaeological team of students and specialists , about fifteen strong , had begun the third week of a two-month excavation season on the Jabbul Plain of northern Syria . We were bracing ourselves for the hot and dry summer days we could expect at our site , Tell Umm el-Marra . A tell ( the word means " mound " in Arabic ) is not a natural feature . Rather , it is an archaeological time capsule , with layers of mud bricks , stones , artifacts , and other materials that have accumulated for thousands of years as buildings were lived in , abandoned , fell into ruin , and finally served as the foundations for a new generation of buildings . At Tell Umm el-Marra the remains have accumulated to a height of twenty-seven feet across an area of fifty acres . The mound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In earlier field seasons , our team had whittled away happily at parts of the mound , exploring the residue of a small city founded about 2800 B.C. But on this particular morning I was feeling disappointed . We had begun digging trenches in what we referred to as the " acropolis , " a three-and-a-half-acre area at the center of the site . A six-foot-thick wall of mud bricks built around the acropolis in about 1800 B.C. was a tantalizing sign : if ancient inhabitants had taken the trouble to build such a wall , we reasoned , it must have enclosed an important building  --  a palace , perhaps , or a temple . But when we had dug down to the habitation layer dating from the time of the wall , all we found was a shapeless heap of stone cobbles and boulders . <p> Disappointed ? Yes , but certainly not ready to quit . Could the stones and cobbles still be concealing the foundations of a palace or temple ? I asked Alice Petty , a graduate student on our team , to remove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course  --  and dig deeper . As she did , she uncovered the tops of stone wails that enclosed a rectangular room about twelve feet long by eight feet wide . By the style of the pottery shards in the fill , I judged the room to date from an earlier period . Actually , though , it still did n't look very promising ; I rather tepidly suggested to Petty that she keep digging and let me know if anything interesting turned up . <p> Amulet in the form of a wild goat , carved in lapis lazuli , was found near the neck of one of the women ; it is pictured at two times actual size . An aerial view of the site and its surroundings forms the background of these two pages . <p> But as she proceeded with the work , my skepticism turned to excitement . Petty started finding unbroken vessels of pottery , which signaled that the contents of the room were unusually well-preserved . Then I heard her call me : " Glenn , there 's metal here . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two large , lozenge-shaped metal objects were protruding from the soil . Could they be bronze spearheads ? One of our colleagues , Sally Dunham , an independent scholar with a special interest in ancient art , came to the edge of the trench to see what was going on . Why would complete vessels and metal objects be found intact inside a room ? " Maybe it 's a tomb , " she suggested . A few strokes with my brush next to the metal objects revealed part of a long bone . I quickly called over Jill Weber , our zooarchaeologist from the University of Pennsylvania , to have a look . <p> " Animal or human ? " I asked her . <p> " Human . " <p> Excavation of the upper layer of Tomb 1 , right , at Tell Umm el-Marra , in Syria , revealed bones of two young women and two infants , along with pottery and various ornaments . Dating from ca. 2300 b.c. , the tomb was the first of several discovered within the ruins of a small Bronze Age city . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Beirut Archaeological Center , and she began work on what we now understood to be not a room , but a tomb  --  and a tomb of substantial size . The bones of an adult soon began to emerge , together with objects that had been buried on or near the body . Around the skeleton 's neck were beads and amulets of lapis lazuli , the much-prized blue stone from eastern Afghanistan . One of the amulets was carved in the shape of a wild goat , with its horns sweeping elegantly backward . Closer inspection of the metal lozenges , our first find , revealed that they were silver , not bronze , and pierced lengthwise , perhaps for stringing as ornaments . <p> The next morning Stuart began to uncover a second skeleton . At lunchtime she came into our expedition headquarters , thrilled . Next to the second skeleton she had noticed a thin , gold-colored strip in the soil . Her first thought had been , " What ninny dropped aluminum foil into my excavation ? " Then she realized the strip was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It proved to be a headband , accompanied by gold beads and a gold bracelet . <p> As the days proceeded , a remarkable story began to unfold . The tomb contained three layers of skeletons , undisturbed , as were the rest of the tomb 's contents , in the nearly four and a half millennia since they were buried . Ancient tombs containing gold and silver objects tend to be prime targets for robbers , both ancient and modern , and so a pristine tomb is an exhilarating find . In three subsequent excavating seasons ( in 2002 , 2004 , and 2006 ) we have discovered that " our " tomb , now designated Tomb 1 , was not alone , but was part of a large complex devoted to the burial of high-ranking individuals in the mid- to late third millennium B.C. <p> We have also found clear signs of sacrifice . Next to the tombs we uncovered five smaller enclosures of mud brick that contained the bodies of sacrificed animals and , perhaps , sacrificed infants as well . What we call Installation B , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the headless skeletons of two equids ( they could be donkeys or Asiatic wild asses  --  or perhaps hybrids of the two ) . The bodies had been interred in a standing position ; we found the skulls , along with a spouted jar , on a ledge overlooking the skeletons . After the equids had been positioned , smaller bodies were added to the enclosure : two sets of three puppies , as well as a human infant . The other " installations " contained similar interments Of equids , sometimes decapitated , often together with human infants , spouted jars , and puppies . In short , the excavations at Tell Umm el-Marra have yielded a rich trove of material and , given the findings , have raised many questions . Our current inquiries are focusing on two issues : how did the centrally placed tombs function in the community , and why was the tomb complex abandoned and eventually covered over ? <p> Tell Umm el-Marra lies in what is now northern Syria , not far from the region bounded by the Tigris and Euphrates rivers  --  often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ruins of Tuba , a city first mentioned in cuneiform texts from Ebla . <p> Tell Umm el-Marra was first excavated in the late 1970s and early 1980s by a Belgian team directed by the late Egyptologist Roland Tefnin . Those investigations determined the sequence of occupations at the site , which was inhabited most intensively during the third and second millennia B.C. Tefnin also uncovered a number of rooms , as well as a city gate on the northeast side . <p> Hans H. Curvers , an archaeologist at the University of Amsterdam , and I launched our own joint excavations in 1994 . From the beginning , our goal has been to investigate the origins and early development of urban civilization in western Syria . In the standard terms of our profession , we are investigating Bronze Age times , roughly between 3000 B.C. and 1200 B.C. That period , following the widespread adoption of agriculture , is notable not only for the advent of bronze metallurgy ( as its name implies ) , but also for the emergence of writing and , in general , an increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the region between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers that some consider the " cradle of civilization , " has been well examined , but archaeologists still have a lot to learn about developments in western Syria . <p> Tell Umm el-Marra , the largest site in the Jabbul Plain , probably functioned as a regional center throughout the Bronze Age see map on this page . It may have been the city known as Tuba , which is first mentioned in texts dating from around 2400 B.C. that were discovered in Ebla , a much larger city to the southwest . Whatever its name in ancient times , though , it was strategically positioned . To the east was a dry steppe frequented by pastoral nomads and , beyond them , the Euphrates River . To the west were rainy agricultural lands , along with the major city of Aleppo . Hence Umm el-Marra probably controlled east-west trade between Aleppo and the Euphrates , and likely served as a trading hub in its own right . <p> Gold pendant , shown two times actual size , was among the many ornaments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our first few field seasons concentrated on two 400-year-long periods , the Late Bronze Age ( 1600-1200 B.C. ) and the Middle Bronze Age ( 2000-1600 B.C. ) . Then came the unexpected discovery of our tomb , which dated from 2300 B.C. , in the Early Bronze Age . The skeletons in the early tomb had been buried in three layers , inside rectangular wooden coffins . Few traces of wood remained , but the shape and material of the coffins was apparent from impressions left in the soil and other residues . <p> In the topmost of the three layers were the two bodies , placed side by side , that Barbara Stuart had first exposed , females between fifteen and twenty years of age see photograph oft pages 42-43 . Each of them had the skeleton of an infant placed at the knee , and around the bodies were costly objects  --  beads , disks , and pendants of gold ; silver bracelets ; gold and silver pins used to fasten clothing ; a bronze torque , or circular neck ornament ; and scores of ceramic vessels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were two men , also placed side by side , and a baby at some distance away near the tomb entrance see photograph below . Those skeletons appeared to have been interred at the same time as the women , but ill contrast with the women , the men were buried with relatively few objects  --  just a bronze dagger and spearhead , a silver headband , and a silver bracelet . Finally , the lowest layer held the body of a single adult , probably a woman , who had apparently been buried earlier , because her bones had been much disturbed by the interment of the men above . A. few objects , including a small silver cup and some silver pins , were found with her bones . <p> Middle layer of Tomb 1 contained the skeletons of two men ( above ) and an infant ( not shown ) , apparently buried at the same time as the two women buried above them ( see photograph on pages 42-43 ) . Beneath the men 's skeletons were earlier remains , of another adult . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two richly adorned women of about the same age , each with a baby , placed above two relatively " poor " men ? Perhaps the women were of high rank  --  princesses or priestesses  --  and they were accompanied in death by lower-ranking men . The men might have been servants or guards who had been sacrificed to escort their mistresses into the afterlife . That kind of human sacrifice was not unknown in the period : archaeologists who excavated tombs in the royal cemetery of the city of Ur , in southern Mesopotamia , found evidence of slain attendants , and there may be another example of such sacrifice at Tell Banat , a Syrian site on the Euphrates . Or , more mundanely , perhaps the four adults and three babies had succumbed all at once from natural causes , such as an epidemic . <p> In our excavating seasons since 2000 , six more tombs have been exposed , dating from between 2500 B.C. and 2200 B.C. Most of them , unfortunately , were disturbed in antiquity . Subsequently , however , the entryways were blocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informative remains . Each tomb contained the bones of at least two people , and pottery ( useful for dating ) was abundant , including many intact vessels . In some cases , as in Tomb 6 , we found additional artifacts , including vestiges of a wooden coffin , gold and silver pins , bronze daggers , and beads of lapis lazuli , gold , and a quartzlike , reddish-brown stone known as carnelian . <p> But the prize among the new tombs was Tomb 4 , which had not been seriously disturbed . In our excavation we found Tomb 4 had two levels , and in the deeper ( and thus older ) of the two , the skeletons of two adult females and one adult male lay in repose . The women had ornaments next to their bodies , including silver pins and squares of gold with lattice designs . Pierced , pointed objects made of ivory were found with both sexes ; we tentatively interpret them as hair ornaments . Two miniature tables carved from basalt , which we discovered stacked one on top of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And in the northwest corner of the tomb we were surprised to find a pair of eyes staring out at us from the soil that filled a small square shaft  --  eyes of stone and shell of the kind used for inlays in statuary . They may have belonged to a small statue of wood or other material that rotted away long ago . <p> Gold and silver pins for fastening clothing were recovered from Tomb 6 . They are shown three-quarters actual size . <p> The second , upper level of Tomb 4 also held three bodies : an adult male , an adult female , and a child . Once again , as in Tomb 1 , the woman 's body was the most elaborately outfitted . It is unlikely that the costlier grave goods accorded to women signified that women held greater wealth or status than men . Texts from the same period make it clear that men wielded the greater political and economic power . Perhaps upper-class women of ancient Umm el-Marra were simply more likely to wear ostentatious jewelry than were their male counterparts  --  as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showy accoutrements may thus have advertised the wealth or prestige of her family or her husband . <p> Near the woman in the upper level of Tomb 4 we also discovered seven silver vessels . They are similar in shape to metal vessels found in the royal cemetery of Ur , suggesting that the elites of Syria were imitating the styles of their Mesopotamian counterparts ( and maybe vice versa ) . Owning luxury goods in exotic styles or from exotic places was presumably a good way to display one 's high status . <p> Clay cylinder , perforated lengthwise and covered with what appears to be some form of writing , is one of four discovered in the upper level of Tomb 4 , dating from ca. 2350 B.C. It is shown three-quarters actual size . <p> One of the most provocative questions was what to make of the skeletons of animals and infants associated with the tombs . Our conclusion was that rituals featuring animal sacrifice and perhaps even human infant sacrifice accompanied the burials of the adults in the tombs . So who were those adults ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their community . Contemporaneous texts from Ebla reveal that high-ranking people were buried with elaborate jewelry of the kind we excavated . In fact , if Umm el-Marra was presided over by independent rulers , the tombs may qualify as royal . At the very least , the individuals buried within them were once members of powerful families . <p> The sacrificed donkeys or wild asses would have been objects of prestige : contemporaneous texts from Ebla and elsewhere state that such animals drew the war wagons of the elite , and that they were costly . Perhaps the sacrificed animals were intended to transport the deceased to the afterlife , or to serve them in it . Why infant sacrifice was conducted  --  if it was  --  is harder to explain . Human sacrifices often accompanied elite burials in such early urban societies as Dynasty 1 of Egypt , the Shang period of China , and in the Ur royal cemetery , perhaps as a display of raw power . <p> The tombs also probably acted as constant reminders of the importance of the deceased . After all , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised up , and at least partly freestanding . The descendants of the dead , by making offerings at the tombs of those interred , may have acquired and maintained their own prestige . Ritual texts from Ebla , which describe offerings made to deceased kings by the living ruler , support that interpretation . In Mesopotamia , by contrast , royal tombs such as the ones at Ur were subterranean and well hidden , suggesting that ancestor veneration was less central , ideologically as well as spatially . <p> Judging from the small number of bodies in each tomb and the changing styles of pottery , we also infer that power and prestige shifted from one family dynasty to another fairly quickly , in as little as a generation or two . As I noted earlier , many of the tombs were disturbed and then had their entryways blocked with boulders . Groups that attained power may have desecrated the tomb of their predecessors , thereby destroying the link between the living community and the family that was out of favor . <p> Bones of an infant ( lower left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper right ) were found in a compartment near tombs 1 and 3 . Both the infant and the animal may have been sacrificed , evidence of the high rank of those interred in one or the other of the tombs . <p> It is unlikely that the perpetrators were either ordinary robbers or family members of the deceased . First , it seems unlikely that robbers would have taken the trouble to block the doorways on their departure . Second , if the tombs had been plundered by robbers , then resealed by community members who valued the interred people , an effort would have been made to tidy things up inside the tombs . But the interiors were left in disarray . <p> Around the end of the Early Bronze Age , about 2000 B.C. , many Syrian cities shrank in size or were abandoned altogether . The reason for the apparent collapse is a subject of vigorous debate . Some point to abrupt climatic change , others to human-induced environmental degradation . We have studied both botanical and faunal remains for clues , but so far we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of Umm el-Marra were abandoned , and many nearby settlements were deserted as well . <p> Then , around 1800 B.C. , there was a resurgence of the community , probably related to the rise of a powerful kingdom based at Aleppo . An energetic program of public works was undertaken at Umm el-Marra , including new earth and cobble ramparts encircling the site and a mudbrick city wall on top . In that same era , the " acropolis " was enclosed with its thick wall , and the tombs were covered over by the heap of rocks I had found so disappointing . <p> In the fourteenth century B.C. , Umm el-Marra fell victim to an episode of substantial destruction : some buildings were burned , with some of their household implements , luxury items , and other contents still inside . The timing suggests a link with the onslaught on western Syria by King Suppiluliuma I , whose domain was centered in Boghazkoy , in present-day Turkey . By 1200 B.C. , the end of the Late Bronze Age , Umm el-Marra was abandoned , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Umm el-Marra was the site of the city of Tuba , that period is also the latest in which Tuba is mentioned in ancient texts . <p> The mound on the Jabbul Plain was reoccupied from time to time thereafter , most substantially between about 500 and 200 B.C. Those who came that late , however , would not have known about the tombs , by then hidden and forgotten . The people buried within were left for archaeologists to discover . In a way , then , we are the first who can restore to them a small measure of the glory they once claimed . <p> To find Web links related to this article , visit **25;1751;TOOLONG and click " Online Extras , " then " Web Links , " and finally " May 2007 .
