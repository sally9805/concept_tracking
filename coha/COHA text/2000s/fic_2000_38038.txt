Although several years have passed since he last graced us with his fiction ( " Look Away " appeared here in early 1992 ) , Mr. Utley has not been idle . He has published two books of poetry , This Impatient Ape and Career Moves of the Gods , and in 1997 an Australian press put out his first story collection , Ghost Seas . Like Albert Cowdrey 's " Mosh , " this story takes us far away in time . Mr. Utley , however , chooses to look down the opposite end of time 's arrow , towards the Silurian Age , where he has set most of his recent stories . While it does n't fit comfortably into the science fiction genre ( " I just do n't seem able to give a hoot about those crazy Buck Rogers ideas any more , " confesses Mr. Utley ) , this story does n't fit into the literary genre either ... and yet it 's too good to withhold from you readers . So here you have it . He says his guiding spirit is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have reached a higher figure in our day , he may fly to the moon at any moment , but this is in contrast to the very small range of the feelings that drive him . All his motives can still be counted on his fingers . " <p> BEARDEN HAD NOT SLEPT on her cot . Well , Wheeler thought sourly , I 'm glad somebody around here 's got a love life , and she kicked her blanket into a loose wad at the foot of her own cot . She peeked outside at the lightening sky . Maybe I can do some painting today . The prospect immediately sweetened her mood . She felt the familiar itch for the brush in her fingers , and something more than that , the vital connection of hand to brain and eye . Today , by God , she promised herself . She dressed quickly in old fatigues , slipped the strap of her specimen case over her shoulder , and stepped outside , into air thick with estuarine fragrances . The camp was quiet ; she saw no one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briskly to the spongy edge of the marsh , and then proceeded upstream , keeping to the left of a broad , dark , algal band that marked the frontier of habitability-unless , she reflected , one were either human or a lichen . And , of course , one could n't be a lichen , because lichens were symbiots . Ugh , she thought , botanical humor . Better not repeat that to anyone in camp . Well , maybe to the botanists .... The sun rose quickly behind her , illuminating the featureless black expanse of the marsh by degrees . Plant growth at the edge of the marsh was patchy , struggling - brave little plant pioneers , as she regarded them , delicate as hairs , sprouting wherever a film of moisture held together a crumb of dirt . She knelt , measured , carefully dug out an intact brick of earth . As she put it into the specimen case , she heard a rustling , crunching , crinkling noise coming from nearby . She looked down and glimpsed something elongate slithering across the toe of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three feet away : she could not have said whether she had teleported across that distance or merely broadjumped backward from a squatting position . She could not have said her own name right at that moment . Her entire attention was fixed on the monster nosing among the psilophytes . It was one of the biggest land animals she had seen since her arrival in Paleozoic time - as long as her forearm , as big around as her finger . Two , possibly three , seconds elapsed before the monster 's common name came back to her : millipede . Then she laughed nervously . A harmless o1 " millipede , she thought , and I nearly jumped out of my skin . Granted , it 's an enormous harmless o1 " millipede , but , still .... The scientist in her took over ; she crouched over the animal , peered at it , debated taking it back to camp . The artist in her decided to let it be : it was too lovely where it was . Its flattened and segmented body was like a string @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs rippled like water . The rustling , crunching noise was the sound it made as it propelled itself through the psilophytes . It ate its way through them as well . The crinkling noise was the sound made by smaller arthropods as they scrambled in search of still smaller arthropods , and of any other edible thing , amid the organic rubble left by the millipede 's passing . Catch you next time , Wheeler thought as the millipede and its entourage moved off into the marsh . She began walking back . The camp had by now begun to awaken , and the Navy as well . She saw people moving among the tents and Quonset huts and thought that she could even make out tiny human figures moving about on the big Navy vessel anchored in the bay . A helicopter turned far out over the water and bore away to the north . The sky was lightening to a clear , brilliant blue , and , drifting serenely through that sky , was an omen - a beautiful fat cumulus cloud . Back at the tent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth sample she had collected into the tullgren funnel , which consisted of a container , with a sheet of gauze affixed to its base , mounted over a funnel . Above the container was a lamp . Heat from the lamp would cause the animals to move away from the top of the soil sample ; though complete extraction might take two or three days , most animals in the sample could be expected to move through the gauze and into the funnel during the first couple of hours . Then Wheeler would collect , categorize , and count them . She turned on the lamp , then left for the mess tent . A Navy cook served her breakfast . The only other people present were the astronomy team . Gabbert , the leader , sat with his eyes closed and his long chin propped up on his hands . He looked as though he had been up all night ; probably he had . Between his elbows on the table , a cup of coffee cooled and a plate of eggs congealed . His two assistants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they lingered as Wheeler sat down across from Gabbert . She ignored them and bade him good morning ; he barely opened his eyes , croaked a hello , and reclosed his eyes . Manning said , " Big news . The satellite 's up . " Wheeler nodded . " That is big news . " Manning smirked . " Are you rooting in the dirt this fine morning , or painting ? " " I 've done my rooting for the day , " she said evenly . " Maybe I 'll paint later . " His smirk approached to within a millimeter of becoming a sneer . " Youre the only person here who has a hobby . " Hayes took that as her cue and said , " You 're the only person here who needs a hobby , " and smiled to show that she was just kidding , , really . Wheeler smiled back , thinly , and said , " Science and art make for a well-rounded life . " They departed . " Gab , " she said , " tell me something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened both eyes ; they glittered with amusement in his otherwise saturnine face . " What you mistake for dweebishness is actually an aristocratic disregard for inferiors . We 're higher in the pecking order of science . Astronomy is clean and cool and cerebral . You root in dirt and stick your fingers into dead trilobites and things . " " By the way , congratulations . On the satellite . " He shrugged and turned down the comers of his mouth . " I had nothing to do with it . I was n't even asked for my opinion . " " Are we going to have to look through your spyglass to see it when it passes over ? " " Nope . I 'll point it out to you . Come before midnight . " " I 'll be there , if I 'm conscious at all . But I 've got lots of work to do today , and I want to get in some painting , too . " Gabbert clucked his tongue at her . " It seems to me that the Silurian Period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : If you 'd stayed in Austin , you could still be teaching at U.T. and making a few bucks on the side selling paintings of bluebonnets . " The moue she made only encouraged him . " Some flowers would enliven your masterpiece . " " When have you seen it ? " " Got a good look , " he said , " when I stopped by to make a pass at your tentmate . " How could you ? she thought , but she knew . She said , " No wonder she 's been in a bad mood . " " She 's been in a bad mood because of the smell . Our Miz Bearden is a bit of a princess . She 's always complaining about smells . " " Then she 's in the wrong line of work , " Wheeler said , more harshly than she had intended . " Anyway , I am going to finish the painting today . " " Uh huh . She says you say that every time . You go out , slop some paint on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole tent ends up reeking of turpentine . " " Mineral spirits . " " Same difference . It 's put her off sex . What you 're doing with that poor painting is beyond pathetic . It 's Sisyphean . " " Like Sisyphus , I have no choice . Got ta keep rolling that rock up the hill . Got ta keep believing that one of these times it wo n't roll back down . " " You know , " Gabbert said , " if you really want to make pictures , you can do it faster with a computer , and without the smelly mess . You 'd be happier with the result , too . " " Gab , you just do n't understand about artists , " " Artists ! " " Oh , never mind . " She attacked her breakfast . He let her eat for a minute , then said , " Come on , tell me . My interest has been piqued . Tell me about artists . " " Oh-kay . Listen . I sneaked in art history and music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One summer I got to go to Europe , and I hit all the art museums . I was looking at this one van Gogh one day - are you at all familiar with van Gogh ? " " I only ever saw the movie about him . A seriously disturbed man . Cut his own ear off . " " I was looking at this van Gogh painting of a rustic drawbridge . It 's just called " The Drawbridge . " He painted it in Arles in May of 888 . I 'd seen reproductions of it before , but you can look at a thing for hours or years before you actually see it . And here was the original painting , and there I was , when my attention was drawn to a fat cloud off to one side . And as I looked at it , I suddenly had this , this insight - 11 " Whoa , " Gabbert said mildly , " jump back . " " Make fun . But for just an instant , I saw that canvas exactly as Vincent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working on it . I was so conscious of the power , the sheer responsiveness of his hand . I saw how he 'd dabbed on a big glob of white paint , swirled it just so , and voila ! Cloud by van Gogh . He made it look so easy , and yet - " Wheeler smiled ruefully . " Ever since , I 've been trying to reproduce that cloud . No , that 's not quite it . I do n't want to copy it . Van Gogh only painted what he could see right in front of him . He did n't trust memory . He painted a thing the way he saw it . I want to do that . Paint a thing the way I see it . I want to feel what van Gogh felt when he looked at a cloud , and his eye transmitted what it saw to his brain , and his brain passed it along to his hand , and his hand made it , made , you know , art . " " Sounds like pure obsession to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd 've gone around doing whatever van Gogh went around doing . Retraced his steps , dug up my own cadmium . " " But kept both your ears , I hope . " " All I want is to have what goes in here - " Wheeler pointed at her eyes " - to come out here , " and she waggled the fingers of her right hand . " Just one time , I want the brush to be a direct , spontaneous extension of myself . Van Gogh wrote once , " What a queer thing touch is , the stroke of the brush . " I know I 'm a dud as a painter , even as a Sunday painter . But just one time in my life , I 'd like to brush on some flake white and have it magically become a cloud . " " I hope you 'll let me know when it happens . " " Maybe today . The light 's going to be perfect . And I 've had an omen . A beautiful cumulus . " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clouds . " " Clouds gone to waste , Gab ! Clouds that formed and dissipated in vain . But today I 've had a sign . " " From whom ? God ? Or the Impressionists ? " WHEN WHEELER GOT BACK to her tent , Bearden was there , freshly scrubbed , dressed in a terrycloth bathrobe , with a towel wrapped turban-fashion around her head , and looking about as out of place as Wheeler could not think of anything sufficiently inappropriate . She settled for saying , " You 're late . " Bearden removed the towel , and as she began combing out her hair , she said , " I am not late . I just did n't leap out of bed at the crack of dawn . " Wheeler resisted the impulse to ask , Gab 's bed ? " The sun 's a third of the way up the sky . " " That sun hurries too much to suit me . No wonder I 've been starved for sleep ever since I got here . I ca n't adjust to these shorter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not wreck your whole day , she warned herself , otherwise she 'll get into one of her moods and there wo n't be anything you can do to get her out of it and you wo n't be able to do your work , never mind any painting . Make an effort now , or the day is lost . Wheeler put a smile on her face and said , with all the good humor she could muster , " I have only minimal sympathy for the problems of anybody who 's as slim , graceful , blonde , and sought-after as yourself . " Bearden managed a pinched son of smile in return . Wheeler sat down at the work table and examined the tullgren funnel . The first refugees from the lamp-heated brick of dirt had begun tumbling down the funnel . By now she knew them all : worms and mollusks the size of rice grains , wingless , unfinished-looking insects , some tiny , primitive spiders , and one small , modern-looking , thoroughly annoyed scorpion . As she sorted them , she kept hoping to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the painting , and she told herself , Never wish for more than one good thing at a time . Bearden , her toilette completed , sat down at her own end of the table and went to work . Finally , Wheeler thought , her mouth set in a thin , firm line . Ca n't let things go on this way for much longer . Yeah , like you can really do anything about it .... She and Bearden had been assigned to a team by their expedition leader , with no regard for personal compatibility . In a small , isolated camp off in the hinterlands , the arrangement probably would have worked ; with no place to go , no way to get there , and nothing to distract them from the job at hand , they would necessarily have developed , out of their common interest in Paleozoic biota , a superficial but sustainable , and mutually sustaining , relationship long on technical talk and devoid of intimacy . Here at the base camp , however , distractions abounded . Bearden did not need to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp ; at any time , it contained hundreds of researchers and hundreds more Navy personnel . Consequently , Bearden 's work was becoming sloppier all the time . Wheeler , who took her own work quite seriously , could not help feeling puritanical . Another consequence - Wheeler looked at the situation honestly  --  was that , here , unfairly , she herself could not simply ignore Bearden and concentrate on her own work . She found herself struggling constantly with personal insecurities she had imagined were not merely laid to rest for good but laid to rest four hundred million years away . Bearden was precisely the kind of woman who had always made her feel fat , graceless , unattractive to men . Rationality was suddenly and unexpectedly no defense against this . It did not matter that Bearden , by slacking off whether consciously or because she was dissipating her energy - was surely destroying her own chances for a career in the field , while Wheeler 's conscientiousness would surely pay handsome dividends in both a scientific and a professional sense . It did not matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone as a lover . It did not matter that it did not matter . The discovery that she was still capable of sexual envy and jealousy came as a very rude shock to Wheeler . She did not regard these as worthy states of mind ; they made her ashamed of herself . For years she had been content in the conviction that her interest in men as men was safely defused . Her experience of men and of love , though not broad , had been deep , and so disappointing in its outcome , so distressing and even disgusting , that her libido had , so to speak , cleared out in the dead of night without giving notice - without , in fact , calling any attention to itself whatsoever . Months had passed , then a year , then another , before she abruptly understood that her work and her private interests , art , music , gardening , nieces and nephews , had expanded to fill the extra space in her life . It had been one of the great liberating moments of her life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat segregating arthropods . I am overjoyed by it . This is not one of the glamorous geologic ages ; for every one of us who 's thrilled to death to he here there 're hundreds back home , thousands , who curse spacetime for not opening up in the Mesozoic or the time of the early hominids or whenever . Sometimes I even catch myself wishing I could step backward or forward several million years to get some quick answers to questions . But I 'm happy with what I 've got to work with here . I hope Something unfamiliar dropped through the funnel . Well , well , look at you , Wheeler thought . She recognized the creature as a trigonotarbid , a ten-legged arthropod that somewhat resembled , but was not , a spider . I hope I have n't just now used up my quota of good luck for the day . I hope I still get to paint . Hope , she believed , was unaimed prayer . The exodus of invertebrates through the funnel slowed . Wheeler leaned back on her campstool and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stretched her arms above her head and made a decision and looked over at Bearden . " Go get some lunch if you want . " Or get laid or whatever . " I 'm going to knock off for a couple of hours and go paint . " She could not resist adding , " I have n't taken any time off in days . " Wheeler opened her footlocker and drew forth a box containing brushes , tubes of paint , and other paraphernalia . A rectangle of masonite hung from the tentpole ; she took it down , uncovered it , held it at arm 's length , regarded it with a particular mixture of affection , embarrassment , and resolve . Depicted in oils on the board was a drab Paleozoic landscape , all greens , grays , and browns , stretching uncertainly to a leaden sea ; above was a cerulean expanse marred by white blotches that might have been fungoid growths . An upper corner of the board had been scraped off and regessoed . She slipped the board into a carrying case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the tent with the case under one arm and the bundle over the other shoulder . She lugged this cargo , panting and perspiring , to the heights behind the camp and erected the easel on a finger of rock that pointed seaward . The sun was high and hot , so she did not fall immediately to work but sat with her legs dangling over the edge of the rock . She breathed languorously . Lichens discolored the rock ; she covered one with her hand . Lords of the highland , she thought . For now . From her vantage point she could see clear across the estuary . The crumbling headlands were striped white , gray , brown ; the turbid mocha  --  colored waterways wound through the vividly , succulently green marsh and spilled into the bay . Van Gogh , she thought , can not have loved Provence more than I love this , When she looked out to sea , her heart was lifted higher still by the sight of two separate cloud masses , great fat billowy things approaching from the horizon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , but thank you both for showing up . She got up . Time now to put all thoughts of work and jerks out of your mind . Time to paint a cloud . She studied the masonite board as clinically as she could . It would be pleasant , she thought as she prepared her palette , to be able to blame my picture 's dreariness , its lifelessness , on the Silurian vista . This world 's so quiet , sometimes it does give me the creeps . Its colors are so drab , so monotonous , sometimes I ache for a bird with scarlet plumage , or some sunflowers . Impossible , of course , I 'm a long way off in time from birds and flowers . It would be nice to get flowers Stop that . You 're going to paint only what is here . This is Earth on the verge of erupting with riotous life , and the only reason you ca n't paint it is that you ca n't paint . Nevertheless , as she carefully scooped up a glob of flake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know how much I love art , how much I enjoy painting , and you also know that I do n't think for one second that I actually have talent . I know I 'm utterly devoid of it . All I want , Lord , just this once , is a cloud . And , as usually happened when she began thus , she thought , Why am I asking God to help me paint a cloud ? If I can get things from God just by asking for them , should n't I ask for something like world peace or at least more funding Stop . It . Do n't think about anything except the cloud . Not about whatever you 're not thinking about but about the cloud . Push everything except the cloud out of your mind and think only about the cloud . Think about the cloud . She began to get into it . She stepped closer to the easel and moved the tip of the brush toward the scraped-off , re-gessoed spot on the masonite board where she had tried and failed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple cloud - do n't think about failure do n't think about anything except the cloud . Think Cloud . Now something in her did seem changed : she looked at one of the clouds out over the sea , the one she had chosen without having to think about it , and she let everything that was not essential to the moment fall cleanly away from her , work , Bearden , the hot sun , time , space , until all that remained were cloud , eye , hand , and she felt , believed in , the connectedness of eye to hand , so that the sight of the cloud whirled inside her head and flowed out , down , along her arm , into her fingers . The brush untremblingly approached the masonite board . She took a deep breath and held it . She dabbed the paint on the board and gave it a swirl . What a queer thing touch was . She said , " Voila ! " Then she almost cried . Walking down to the camp , she thought , Do I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gabbert sitting on a campstool in front of his tent , pecking at a laptop . She set her equipment on the ground . After a moment , she said , " Did I tell you , " and she held her hands about a foot apart , " this morning I saw a millipede this long ? " " I do n't know whether to be thrilled or horrified , but I 'm sure it 'll chap Curray 's butt . " Curray was a widely disliked entomologist . " I found my first trigonotarbid today , too . " " Ah . Did you ? " " About tonight . Satellite-watching . Can I bring a date ? " " Can you ? " " May I bring somebody ? I think I 'm going to set my cap for a Navy man . " " Bring the whole Navy if you like . It 's an occasion . " She sat on the ground before Gabbert , took the masonite board from its case , and placed it across her knees . He looked over his laptop at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do art today ? " Wheeler glowered . " It 's not as easy as it looks , you know . " With her knife , she began to scrape a white fungoid blob from a corner of the board , disconsolately at first , then with the resurgent conviction that it would all be made right one of these times .
