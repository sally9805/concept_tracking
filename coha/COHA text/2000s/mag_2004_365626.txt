ARE PEOPLE OBSOLETE IN MOVIES ? HAVE we seen the last of actors  --  actual human beings playing fictional ones  --  who perform on a set constructed by burly artisans , under lights operated by fellows with quaint guild titles like gaffer and best boy ? Maybe we have . Maybe it 's time . I mean , if there 's one thing that holds cinema back from being a 21st century art form , it 's people . So let 's go with pixels . They 're cuter , cheaper , better behaved . They can simulate funny sea creatures ( Shark Tale ) , re-create 1939 Manhattan or Shangri-La ( Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow ) , visualize a future dystopia ( Ghost in the Shell 2 : Innocence ) with a wave of a wand , the click of a mouse . <P> Traditional moviemaking , a toy of the Industrial Revolution , was a cumbersome machine from the start and remained so for a century . To a generation that got its visual schooling in front of the small , teeming screens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make movies seem like real life , only cooler , is as anachronistic as a telegram in the e-mail age . Now a generation of directors is moving from analog to digital . They want to make films that hit the delete button on reality  --  films whose highest aspiration is to be cartoons . <P> And not your Uncle Walt 's cartoons , the creaky two-dimensional kind with hand-made drawings and singing dwarfs and teapots . Even the most familiar looking of our new trio  --  Shark Tale , from the people responsible for the Shrek megahits  --  is in the computer-generated mode . Another DreamWorks cartoon that eerily resembles the work of its competitor Pixar ( Antz to match A Bug 's Life , Shrek to counter Monsters Inc. ) , this one goes underwater , as Pixar 's Finding Nemo did , but with a more urban-contemporary tilt and much less craft and heart . <P> Oscar the fish ( voiced by Will Smith ) is a little dude with a big mouth who becomes a hero under false pretenses , by saying he slew a shark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don Lino ( Robert De Niro ) , the sea 's feared codfather . To propel the plot , Don Lino 's sissy son Lenny ( Jack Black ) befriends Oscar and his adoring friend Angie ( Rene Zellweger ) . At its jauntiest , as when it shows Oscar at work in a whale car wash , Shark Tale is the Jaws that refreshes , but too often it just piles on the gags . The film has a hectic , sitcom air and a full-of-himself hero who is as likely to grate as to ingratiate . <P> Sky Captain is every bit as much an animated film as Shark Tale . Kerry Conran 's script has a plot lifted and sifted from lots of ' 30s films  --  The Wizard of Oz , Lost Horizon and a dozen sassy newspaper comedies . But the technique is the star here : Conran 's devising of a Deco-meets-delirium universe that he projected onto a blue screen , in front of which the game , clueless stars  --  Jude Law as the intrepid flyboy , Gwyneth Paltrow as a plucky news gal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
