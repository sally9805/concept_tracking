<p> The Internet is revolutionizing health care as millions of patients turn to the Web to research their symptoms , diseases , doctors and drugs , bringing an unprecedented level of knowledge and power to their own care . <p> Net-savvy patients are e-mailing their doctors , ordering prescriptions online , making appointments over the Web , participating in Internet support groups and sifting through medical studies that once only doctors could access easily . <p> Already , physicians are becoming accustomed to a new breed of patient : one who is armed with information and eager to play a role in what may be the most fundamental change in the doctor-patient relationship since managed care became common more than 10 years ago . <p> " The old system of the patient being a passive entity  --  that model is . . . going out , " said Dr. Tony Lu , medical director of integrative medicine for Loyola University Health System . " The new model is the patient is actively involved in the care . " <p> That was the case for Jude Crouch , 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diabetes more than two years ago , he rushed online and read about medications , diet and blood-sugar monitoring . <p> " I got virtually all my information on the Internet , " he said . <p> Without being asked , he started charting his glucose levels and presented the data to his doctor . <p> " I was much more able to discuss things with him , " Crouch said . <p> Crouch also became the self-appointed facilitator of an online message board , alt.support.diabetes , where he exchanges information with other sufferers . <p> Without the Internet , " I certainly would n't have the control right now , " Crouch said . " I would n't be focused on it . " <p> Patients who have researched their conditions are more likely to take their medication , express opinions about their care and demand more from their insurance companies , doctors say . <p> " I believe the Internet is the salvation of health care in America , " said Dr. Michael Roizen , a medical professor who practices internal medicine at the University of Chicago Hospitals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it away from ( managed care ) . " <p> Of an estimated 72 million adults who used the Internet in December , more than 34 million searched for health information , according to the Internet analysts Cyber Dialogue . That number is expected to grow to 40 million by this summer . <p> Medical sites number in the tens of thousands  --  and the major ones battle for their share of traffic through advertising and marketing blitzes . <p> " There 's a fast effort to get registered users at the beginning , " said Mark Bard , health practice director at Cyber Dialogue . <p> Signs of e-health are popping up all over the Chicago area . <p> Several major hospitals have begun allowing patients to make appointments online . <p> A doctor at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in January became the first physician in the country to write an electronic prescription . <p> People such as Rogers Park resident Nerissa Levey , who has had kidney disease since 1972 , are turning to the Internet for support . Levey regularly logs on to Internet message boards so she can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " They understood me , " she said . <p> About 65 percent of people who search the Internet for information on specific diseases are looking for treatment options , according to a study by Cyber Dialogue . Nearly a quarter are trying to find out if they should see a doctor , and about one-fifth want to connect with others who have the same issues . <p> Women are slightly more likely than men to search for health information , the data show . <p> For Carolyn Placko , of Chicago 's Northwest Side , the Internet offered an extra sigh of relief after a whirlwind hospital stay last year that included a diagnosis of ovarian cancer , surgery and aggressive chemotherapy treatment . <p> Her doctor had given her excellent odds , saying he had a 100 percent cure rate for cases such as hers . But she had her doubts . <p> " I went on to the Internet to find out if he was just blowing smoke , " she said . What she read suggested he was n't . <p> " The information I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " I think I said a little prayer of gratitude that I ended up with this doctor . " <p> John Berglind of Naperville uses e-mail to help manage his diabetes . <p> Three to five times a day , Berglind , co-owner and vice president of an information technology consulting firm in Chicago , pricks his finger to test the glucose levels in his blood . The device he uses , which is smaller than a Palm Pilot , plugs into his computer and uploads the blood sugar data to a spreadsheet . <p> Every three months , he e-mails the results to his endocrinologist . <p> " I would have to go to my endocrinologist once a quarter if I was n't doing this , " Berglind said . Instead , he goes once every nine months , or sooner if the doctor sees a pattern he does n't like . <p> Between visits , the doctor uses e-mailed data to suggest adjustments to Berglind 's diet . And Berglind , who does n't need to take insulin , finds the electronic system easier than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1997 . <p> " Not only do I think it saves me a lot of time , " he said , " it helps me do it . " <p> Patients such as Berglind stand to benefit the most from e-health , which eventually may reduce health care costs by cutting down on unnecessary doctor visits , Cyber Dialogue 's Bard said . <p> " It 's going to be revolutionary first and foremost for these chronic conditions , " Bard said . <p> In addition to e-mailing updates to doctors in between appointments , patients can sign up for automatic prescription refill reminders , read the latest research and , essentially , become experts on their diseases . <p> " It 's an educated consumer , and , at the end of the day , it 's a higher quality of health care , " Bard said . <p> But as with any revolution , there are obstacles to overcome . <p> Despite the high interest among patients , doctors have been relatively slow to embrace the Internet . <p> About 48 percent of online users would like to communicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 percent currently do , according to a Cyber Dialogue study released in October . And nearly three-fourths of those who access health information on the Internet say they would be more likely to trust a Web site recommended by their doctor or pharmacist . But only 4 percent say such recommendations currently are having an impact on which sites they use . <p> Still , physicians ' use of the Internet is improving , according to an American Medical Association study released in December . About 37 percent of doctors surveyed said they used the Web , nearly double the 20 percent who used it in 1997 . Not surprisingly , those who use the Web tend to be somewhat younger , the study showed . <p> The avalanche of online information thundering toward patients has raised a few concerns among time-pressed doctors , even those who express enthusiasm for e-health . <p> " We 're not particularly interested in a patient bringing in 135 pages and saying , ' Would you please read that , ' " said Dr. Richard Corlin , speaker of the American Medical Association 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still relatively few and , for the most part , are outweighed by the benefits . <p> Others worry about misinformation and misinterpretation . <p> " Just because they have all this information in their hand does n't mean they 're more knowledgeable , " Lu said . " Sometimes , they 're more confused . " <p> But Lu encourages patients to do the research  --  and to consult him when they need guidance . <p> " They bring it to me , and I 'll sort through it and say this thing looks like it 's well-proven , this looks like it does n't make sense . " <p> There 's also a concern that some patients might forgo a necessary doctor visit , choosing instead to treat themselves based on their Internet research . <p> " The physician 's opinion is still very important , " said Dr. Ricardo Martinez , senior vice president for health affairs at WebMD , one of the leading Internet health sites . " Will there be some patients who think they 're junior doctors ? Yes . But do we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barriers  --  primarily the need for a more secure and reliable Internet  --  also have held back the tidal wave of e-health , according to a report released late last month by the National Research Council . <p> " The Internet has not penetrated many areas of health and health care that promise even more significant transformations than we have seen to date , " said Edward Shortliffe , head of Columbia University 's department of medical informatics and chairman of the group that wrote the report " Networking Health : Prescriptions for the Internet . " <p> Improved Internet quality and speed could lead to more widespread use of live video for remote medical consultations . <p> And once security issues are adequately addressed , it may become common for patients to have electronic medical records that can be accessed in out-of-town emergency rooms when they become sick on vacation  --  or traded among doctors for faster and more accurate treatment . <p> Right now , only a handful of hospitals use the Internet to locate health information about emergency-room patients , Shortliffe said . <p> Many are grappling with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " As we all know , health information can be extremely personal and sensitive , " Shortliffe said . " So , systems designed to transmit patient medical records across the Internet or to allow remote access to a patient 's medical record must have strong , built-in security protections . " <p> Still , experts said they have high hopes for the future of e-health . <p> " The impact is obvious at the present time , " the AMA 's Corlin said . " And ( it ) is growing and will become substantial . "
