PROLOGUE <p> " I 'm afraid I have some bad news . " <p> Hayley Long , just two weeks past her fi fty- fi rst birthday , heard her <p> physician 's words as if they were being spoken through a long steel <p> tube . <p> I 'm afraid I have some bad news . . . . <p> She wondered fl eetingly how many thousands of people heard the <p> same thing from their doctor every day ? How many patients every <p> hour , maybe every minute , rode those words screeching through a <p> sudden right- angle turn in their lives . <p> I 'm afraid . . . <p> Stephen Bibby , a graduate of Emory Med , had been her physician <p> since a bout of pneumonia twenty or so years ago . He was a man <p> Hayley respected , if for no other reason than that Bibby knew his <p> limitations and never hesitated to make a phone call and arrange a <p> specialist referral for a second opinion . <p> Hayley felt a wave of nausea sweep over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to have to excuse herself to go and get sick even <p> before she found out precisely what she was up against . She made a <p> largely unsuccessful attempt at a calming breath , and tried to maintain <p> an even gaze . <p> " It 's cancer ? " <p> Hayley heard the word in her own voice , but could n't believe she <p> had actually uttered it . Her thoughts would n't stay still . <p> Cancer . . . How could that be ? . . . Oh , God , no . <p> Her initial symptom had been nothing more than an annoying sequence <p> of belly pain and gas . She almost had n't even bothered to <p> mention them to her executive assistant . He was the one who had <p> talked her into calling Bibby . It was his fault . <p> The MRI Bibby had requested was of her abdomen . <p> Cancer . <p> The dizziness and nausea intensifi ed . <p> David did n't handle illness at all well , in himself or others , but at <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , though . Not until all <p> the data were in . He was off skippering his boat in a round- the- world <p> race  --  his lifetime dream . He had lost his fi rst wife to a brain aneurysm , <p> and had waited more than ten years before marrying again . <p> Now this . <p> She had to tell him soon , but not yet . <p> Bibby , a Southern gentleman in his early sixties , looked toward <p> the door as if hoping that another doctor would march into the offi ce <p> and take over . <p> " I asked , is it cancer ? " <p> Biting at his lip , the physician nodded . <p> " Operable ? " she asked . <p> Come on , Stephen ! Help me out here ! <p> " I . . . I do n't know . It looks to have started in your pancreas . <p> That 's the organ which  --  " <p> " I know what the pancreas is . I hear Jimmy Carter talking about <p> pancreatic cancer every time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " It 's . . . it appears to be in some places in your liver . " <p> Bibby turned on his computer with a click of his mouse and rotated <p> it so Hayley could see . A child could have picked out the cancer <p> in her MRI  --  an obscene white mass , dead center in her belly . Dead <p> center . How ironic that her mind 's default for something in the middle <p> would have been those words . <p> Please let this be a dream . Please let it be a fucking dream . <p> Hayley rubbed at her eyes as if trying to paw away the disbelief . At <p> fi fty , she had everything she could ever have wanted  --  marriage to a <p> wonderful , caring man ; stepchildren who treated her like their birth <p> mother ; more money and infl uence than most people could even <p> dream of ; and a perspective on life that made everything make sense . <p> Now this . <p> Pancreatic cancer . . . Inoperable . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long <p> thought desperately . Let it be a dream . . . . Let it be nothing but a <p> bad dream . <p> Petros Sperelakis 's awareness returned gradually and spasmodically . <p> The pain came fi rst  --  a dull throbbing in his groin and burning sensation <p> in his low back . He tried to move , to shift his position , but his <p> body did not respond . <p> Please , I do n't think I can move . Someone please help me . I 'm Sperelakis , <p> Dr. Petros Sperelakis . I ca n't see and I ca n't move . <p> " Connie , why do n't you take a break . I 'll be here for another <p> hour . " <p> " Okay , thanks . Listen , Vernice , he could use some range- of- motion <p> work on his wrists and ankles . " <p> Connie ? Vernice ? I can hear you . I can hear you . Are you Beaumont nurses ? <p> It 's me , Dr. Sperelakis . What do you mean , range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me ? An accident ? A stroke ? A tumor ? Why ca n't I see ? Why <p> ca n't I speak ? <p> The man many considered to be among the premier diagnostic <p> physicians in the world struggled to make sense of his own symptoms . <p> He knew he was having diffi culty holding on to a thought , and <p> that fact frightened him more than almost anything . <p> Why am I in such pain ? Can someone please tell me what happened ? What <p> happened to me ? I can feel that , Vernice . I can feel you moving my ankle . Oh , <p> my God . . . . <p> Multiple contusions and abrasions . . . Fractured pelvis . . . Nondisplaced <p> fracture , proximal humerus . . . Pulmonary contusion and laceration secondary <p> to posterior displaced fractures of right seventh , eighth , and ninth <p> ribs . . . <p> With the grim litany ticking through her thoughts , Thea Sperelakis <p> approached Cubicle 4 in the medical ICU of the Beaumont <p> Clinic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mid  --  brain stem hemorrhage . . . <p> Level I coma . . . <p> Thea hesitated , envisioning what her father would look like and <p> knowing that , as an internal medicine specialist herself , her projection <p> would not be far from on the mark . According to her brother <p> Niko , police estimated that the vehicle that struck their father at fi ve <p> thirty in the early morning eight days ago , then drove away , had to <p> have been traveling seventy , at least . It was a miracle he had survived <p> the impact , which threw him more than twenty- fi ve feet . But then , <p> for as long as Thea could remember , Petros Sperelakis was , to his <p> children , the Lion  --  aloof , powerful , and brilliant , often to the point <p> of majesty . <p> The Lion . <p> The absence of skid marks suggested that the driver never saw his <p> victim . Make that his or her victim , Thea edited , intent on enforcing <p> that sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no <p> clues and no witnesses . <p> Alcohol , she guessed . According to an article by Eileen Posnick in <p> a seven- year- old issue of the American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse , <p> alcohol was involved in more than 90 percent of hit- and- run accidents <p> where the drivers were eventually apprehended . <p> Behind her , Niko stepped out from the group that included his <p> twin , Selene , plus a trio of Beaumont Clinic dignitaries , and took <p> Thea 's arm . He was swarthy and broad- shouldered , with their father 's <p> strong nose and piercing dark eyes , but with features that were <p> somewhat softer . At forty , he was already an associate professor of <p> cardiac surgery at Harvard  --  a wunderkind , with several signifi cant <p> contributions to the fi eld . Selene , exotic , elegant , and totally selfassured , <p> was no less accomplished as a hand surgeon . <p> " You okay , Thea ? " Niko asked softly . <p> As she had been taught to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , bigger than life itself , was in a deep coma <p> from which there was a 0.01 percent chance he would recover even <p> minimal function  --  at least according to the retrospective study of <p> traumatic midbrain hemorrhages published by Harkinson et al . in the <p> American Archives of Neurology , volume 117 , page 158 . One in ten thousand , <p> not counting the ribs and other fractures . <p> Poor Dad . <p> " I 'm okay , " she replied . <p> " Want to go in alone ? " <p> Why would I want to do that ? she wondered , shaking her head . <p> Would their father be any less comatose if she saw him by herself ? <p> She shrugged that it made no diff erence , but sensed she could have <p> come up with a more acceptable response . <p> " Suit yourself , " Niko said in a tone that was quite familiar to her . <p> Thea knew her brother cared about her  --  Selene , too . She also <p> knew that the twins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as odd as their oldest sibling , Dimitri . But their attitude , as <p> emphasized over and over by Thea 's longtime therapist and mentor , <p> Dr. Paige Carpenter , was their problem . <p> One in ten thousand . . . Poor Dad . <p> Thea ran her fi ngers through her short chestnut hair , took a single <p> deep breath , and stepped through the doorway . <p> As anticipated , there were no surprises . Legendary Petros Sperelakis , <p> medical director of the Sperelakis Institute for Diagnostic <p> Medicine , lay motionless  --  the central fi gure in a tableau of medical <p> machines . Across the room , his private duty nurse ( Haitian , Thea <p> guessed ) rose and introduced herself as Vernice . <p> " I have heard a great deal about you , Dr. Thea , " she said . " I hope <p> your fl ight was an easy one . " <p> " I just read , " Thea said , taking the husky woman 's smooth , ample <p> hand . <p> I just read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resounding of understatements . During <p> the twenty- hour series of fl ights and layovers from the Democratic <p> Republic of the Congo to Boston , she had read Don Quixote , the <p> second edition of Deadman 's A Manual of Acu punc ture ( for the second <p> time ) , and Darwin 's Voyage of the Beagle  --  more than sixteen hundred <p> pages in all . She would have made the trip home sooner , but she <p> was on a mission moving from refugee camp to camp in the bush <p> with a team of nutritionists , and simply could n't be reached . <p> " There 's been no change , " Vernice said . <p> " I 'd be most surprised if there were . He has taken a severe <p> beating  --  especially to his head . " <p> Thea approached the bedside , instinctively checking the monitors <p> and intravenous infusions . Petros lay quite peacefully , connected via <p> a tracheotomy tube to a state- of- the- art ventilator . The various <p> Medecins Sans FrontiFres ( Doctors Without Borders ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past fi ve years had been reasonably <p> well equipped , but nothing like this place . <p> The Beaumont , as nearly everyone referred to the institution , was <p> a sprawling campus , the size of a small university , consisting of what <p> had once been Boston Metropolitan Hospital , now augmented by <p> two dozen more buildings , varying widely in architectural style . The <p> buildings were linked by tree- lined sidewalks above , and an intricate <p> maze of tunnels below , some with moving walkways and others with <p> tarnished tile walls , leading in places to stairways that went down for <p> two or three damp stories , and dating back to Metro 's earliest days <p> in the mid- nineteenth century . <p> Oxygen saturation . . . arterial blood pressure . . . cerebrospinal <p> fl uid pressure . . . central venous pressure . . . urine output . . . <p> chest tube drainage . . . cardiac rhythm and ECG pattern . . . <p> Thea took in the complex data and pro cessed them as if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nice and steady . At <p> the moment , the fi erce battle for the life of Petros Sperelakis was being <p> fought at a cellular and even subcellular level . And his youn gest <p> off spring , cursed by him when she made the decision to avoid academic <p> medicine and " give her ser vices away , " to third- world countries , <p> pictured the microscopic confl ict clearly in her mind 's eye . <p> At best it would probably be weeks before the man regained any <p> consciousness . Along the way , his system would have to negotiate a <p> minefi eld of infections , blood clots , kidney stones , embolisms , ce rebral <p> swelling , chemical imbalance , intestinal obstructions , and cardiac <p> events . But in this setting , with this equipment , he would at <p> least have a fi ghting chance . Still , from what Thea knew of her father , <p> if it were his choice , it was doubtful he would try very hard to steer <p> clear of the mines . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time . It had been only <p> eight days since the accident , but his muscle mass was already beginning <p> to waste away . In addition to the trach , he had a gastric feeding <p> tube in place , two IVs , a urinary catheter , which was draining briskly <p> into a collection bag , and a BOLT pressure manometer that passed <p> through his skull and into the spinal fl uid  --  containing ventricle of his <p> brain . His eyelids were paper- taped down to protect his corneas <p> from drying out , and splints on his wrists and ankles were strapped <p> in place to prevent joint contractures , against the remote possibility <p> of a return of function . <p> Petros Sperelakis  --  an icon brought down by a driver who was either <p> in an alcoholic blackout or was aware enough to try and get away <p> before anyone showed up . Never had Thea 's father looked even remotely <p> vulnerable to her . Now , he looked frail and pathetically infantile . <p> Thea sensed that she was expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she planned to be there as much as possible in the days to <p> come . But she had slept little if any on the planes , and the exhaustion <p> of the fl ights was beginning to take hold . Fifteen minutes , she decided . <p> Fifteen more minutes would be enough to stay at the bedside <p> whether the others thought so or not . <p> Niko had invited her to stay at his house , but three kids under ten , <p> much as she loved them , provided more commotion than she could <p> handle . <p> Selene and her partner , a banker or businesswoman of some kind , <p> lived in a designer high- rise condo by the harbor . <p> The obvious choice was the spacious Wellesley home in which she <p> and the others had grown up , and where Petros still lived with the <p> ghost of their mother and with Dimitri who , many years before , had <p> moved into the carriage house along with his computers , his monitors , <p> his shortwave radio , his telescope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novels , and Dungeons and Dragons manuals , and his <p> vast collection of Coca- Cola and Star Wars memorabilia . <p> It would be good to see her brother again for many reasons , not <p> the least of which was that of all those in her family , he was the one <p> she related to the most  --  something of a mirror of what she might <p> have been like had she not had the benefi t of early diagnosis , intervention , <p> and extensive behavior modifi cation therapy . <p> From her early childhood , Thea had memories of the family talking <p> about Dimitri 's aloofness and strange behaviors  --  his lack of <p> friends , off beat humor , and often- inappropriate statements . Physical <p> age , twelve years ahead of her . Emotional age , inconsistent and unpredictable . <p> " Dimitri , this is Robert , your new piano teacher . " <p> " Oh , hello . When 's the last time you went to the dentist ? " <p> She would never know the bulk of what the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also knew that the choices she had made , <p> with Dr. Carpenter 's help , were the right ones for her , and ultimately , <p> for her patients . Keeping her life as uncomplicated as possible , <p> she had learned , was not only a pathway to happiness , it was <p> her roadmap to survival . If there was any single word that did not apply <p> to Petros Sperelakis , it was uncomplicated . <p> Born and raised in Athens until his late teens , Petros was strictly <p> Old Country in his attitudes and philosophy  --  a brilliant physician as <p> dedicated to his calling and his patients as he was hard on his family . <p> Verbal chastisement and high expectations were his weapons , as well <p> as his only means of expressing love . His wife , Eleni , had rebelled <p> against him in one way and one way only , by continuing to smoke <p> cigarettes despite his vehement edicts that she stop . The lung cancer <p> that took her did nothing to soften Petros , and virtually every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impotent plea : " If she had only <p> listened to me . . . If only she had listened . " <p> Thea reached between the tubes and brushed some damp , gray <p> hair from her father 's brow . The sadness she was feeling at seeing <p> him in such a state was , she knew , as much learned as it was deepseated <p> and visceral . But she also knew that it was still as real an emotion <p> as those of her two " neurotypical " siblings . <p> From the beginning , Petros could never understand her shyness , <p> or the severe reactions she had to certain noises  --  especially vacuum <p> cleaners and hair dryers  --  as well as to certain foods , and diff erent <p> textures of clothing . When she was twelve , pressured by Eleni that <p> she was seeming more and more like Dimitri in her lack of friends <p> and her pathological obsessions , especially with books of all kinds , <p> Petros consented to allow his wife to bring her to Dr. Carpenter . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> many of the symptoms associated with the condition called Asperger <p> syndrome . <p> The decision to allow his younger daughter to undergo neuropsychiatric <p> testing and therapy did not come easily to Petros . In the <p> lexicon of his life , there was no such word as ca n't and no such concept <p> as psychotherapy . If he had any weakness at all as a diagnostician , <p> it was in the area of psychosomatic illness and the mind- body <p> connection . <p> " I think he 's comfortable , " Vernice ventured from across the bed . <p> " I 'm sure he is , " Thea replied , managing with some diffi culty to <p> swallow her belief that if Petros was feeling anything , then he was <p> certainly not comfortable , and if he was feeling nothing at all , then <p> trying to equate that void with comfort was a stretch . <p> " Your brother Dimitri said that if your father was in as deep a <p> coma as he appears to be , it was a futile exercise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Sometimes , Dimitri says things just for the shock eff ect , " Thea <p> replied , smiling inwardly at the number of times and situations in <p> which her eccentric sibling had done just that . Vernice had gotten off <p> relatively easily . <p> " Well , " the nurse said , " at least we have the comfort of knowing <p> that Dr. S. is being taken care of in the greatest hospital in the <p> world . " <p> " Yes , " Thea said , wondering where Vernice , and Newsweek , and the <p> countless others who believed as she did about the Beaumont , could <p> have gotten such quantifi cation about something so unquantifi able . <p> at virtually the same instant , in the Susan and Clyde Terry Cancer <p> Center , on the far side of the broad campus of the so- called greatest <p> hospital in the world , the treatment nurse was doing her job , <p> injecting a cutting- edge experimental drug into the central IV port <p> of a burly man named Jeff rey Fagone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had his <p> rapid accumulation of wealth interrupted by an unusual variant of <p> the blood cancer known as Waldenstrom 's macroglobulinemia . His <p> presenting symptom had been lower-back pain . The referral by his primary <p> care doctor had been to the expert in the disease at the Beaumont , <p> where Fagone went yearly for his fi ve- day spa pampering and <p> executive medical checkup . Now , he was part of a cutting- edge treatment <p> protocol  --  the sort of protocol that the doctors at the Beaumont <p> were renowned for establishing . <p> Fagone fl ew up to the Terry Center weekly on his Gulfstream <p> G500 corporate jet . Now he was about to receive the third in a series <p> of ten treatments . The fi rst two had been absolutely uneventful . <p> This injection , however , would be diff erent . <p> The vial from which the medication was drawn had been skillfully <p> switched during its journey from the research pharmacy to the cancer <p> center . The new vial , with the same ID number as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venom to turn Fagone 's bee sting <p> allergy , duly noted in his medical record , into an anaphylactic <p> reaction  --  a fearsome medical emergency , equivalent to the Fourth <p> of July fi reworks on the Charles River Esplanade . <p> The eruption did not take long to begin . The fi rst few molecules of <p> the venom instantly began mobilizing mast cells from all over <p> Fagone 's body . The cells released huge amounts of histamine and <p> other sensitivity chemicals . More venom , more mast cells , more histamine . <p> In less than a minute , Fagone 's tongue , cardinal red , had <p> swollen to the size of a golf ball , and his lips to violet sausages . The <p> muscles in the walls of his bronchial tubes went into vicious spasm . <p> Seconds after that , his larynx , also in spasm , closed off altogether . <p> His entire body became scarlet , and his fi ngers became nothing more <p> than nubs protruding from softball- sized hands . <p> The team in the Terry unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two- hundred- and- seventy- pound former teamster <p> onto it , then wheeling him to an area that could be screened off from <p> other patients . <p> But they were paddling against a medical tsunami . <p> The IV port was available , but the oncologist covering the unit , a <p> young woman less than half Fagone 's size , was not skilled in dealing <p> with emergencies of this magnitude . By the time she got the right <p> medications into the man , Fagone 's blood pressure had been zero <p> for nearly three minutes . By the time she gave up trying to force an <p> endotracheal breathing tube past the massively swollen , distorted <p> vocal cords , and began clumsily performing her fi rst emergency tracheotomy <p> while waiting for the ENT surgeon to answer his page , <p> there had been no eff ective respirations for four minutes . She had <p> just sliced a scalpel across her patient 's massive throat when his <p> heart stopped . The blood fl owing from the gaping laceration was <p> gentian . <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the resuscitation at the ten- minute mark , a useful airway had still <p> not been established . <p> Jeff rey Fagone , who years before had survived two assassination <p> attempts during his rise to wealth and power in the Teamsters <p> Union , had no chance of surviving this one . <p> Unlike the other attempts , however , there was no suspicion of <p> anything sinister at work here . Fagone had been done in by a lethal <p> allergic reaction to Waldenstrom 's macroglobulinemia experimental <p> drug #BW1745 . No one present that day thought otherwise . There <p> would be no analysis of the contents of the vial , and the perfunctory <p> autopsy performed the next morning would disclose nothing out of <p> the ordinary . <p> The treatment protocol for #BW1745 would be suspended indefi - <p> nitely , but within just a few months , the principal investigator , supported <p> by a hefty grant from one of the pharmaceutical giants , would <p> roll out another experimental drug to meet the demand of referrals <p> from all over the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleanup and <p> staff support for an hour after the tragic event , but there were patients <p> to treat , many of whom had come from even greater distances <p> than Jeff rey Fagone . <p> Soon , like the surface of a pond disturbed by a jumping fish , the <p> ripples had subsided , and the world 's greatest hospital had gone back <p> to being the world 's greatest hospital . <p> <br> Continues ...
