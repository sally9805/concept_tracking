Set aside for a moment the strutting hypocrisy revealed by Jesse Jackson 's confession last week that in 1998 , at the very moment he was providing pastoral counseling to the White House 's resident adulterer , he was carrying on an extramarital affair of his own , with a subordinate who later gave birth to his child . Focus instead on his stupidity : How could the nation 's premier civil rights leader have been so reckless ? Of course , that 's the same question everybody was asking about Bill Clinton in 1998 . But at least Clinton is n't a minister . <P> Judging from the way in which his fellow civil rights leaders are rallying to his defense , most African Americans will probably pardon Jackson for this sin , because we are an extremely forgiving people . Just ask Clinton , Marion Barry , Mike Tyson , O.J. Simpson and a host of other bad actors who have been welcomed back into the fold . But if we let Jackson back into a position of leadership after he completes his promised sabbatical from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> If there 's one thing this sordid episode proves , it 's that Jackson believes black folks will tolerate almost any behavior from their leaders . But this time he 's gone too far . Impregnating Karin Stanford  --  a former political-science professor who at the time of the affair was head of the Washington office of Jackson 's Rainbow/PUSH Coalition  --  was n't a minor ethical lapse . It 's hard to think of any act more certain to knock Jackson , who was a 56-year-old father of five when the baby was conceived , off the moral high horse from which he has preached to inner-city youngsters about the threats posed by aids , drugs and unwed pregnancy . It 's time to give him another gold Rolex , thank him for his service and send him out to pasture . <P> As is usually the case when His Grandiloquence gets into trouble , Jackson has a scapegoat . According to friends , he privately accuses the same vast right-wing conspiracy that tried to destroy Bill and Hillary Clinton of orchestrating a campaign to discredit him because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So far , he has offered no evidence that the charge is true . But from Jackson 's standpoint , the timing of last week 's bombshell  --  right after the holiday named for his hero , Martin Luther King Jr .  --  could not have been worse . <P> For the past few years , he has been stumbling from one pseudo crusade to another , likening every minor crisis  --  the expulsion of six roughnecks from a Decatur , Ill. , high school ; the supposed lynching of a Mississippi youth , which turned out to be a suicide  --  to the glorious civil rights battleground of Selma , Ala . Since last fall , he has been tussling with his former protege , Al Sharpton , who annoyed Jackson by launching a boycott of Burger King , which has long been one of Jackson 's corporate allies . Not until last year 's presidential campaign , when Jackson worked his heart out to help produce the huge black turnout that nearly put Al Gore in the White House , did he regain some of his old magic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
