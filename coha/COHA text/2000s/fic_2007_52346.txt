Perhaps the devil bats will be a smidgen tardy , but we expect the lavishly illustrated trade paperback reissue of Mr. Goulart 's history of the pulps , Cheap Thrills , to make its scheduled release date in January . Also , a lavishly illustrated trade paperback edition of his coffee table book about 1930s and 1940s comic books , Comic Book Culture , is due out by the end of 2006 . Alas , the lavishly illustrated new edition of Ron Goulart 's Weekly is delayed in anticipation of more lavish illustrations , but with this new story in hand , who 's going to complain ? <p> I 'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN to anyone the real reason why I 'm going to be somewhat late turning in my script for Devil Bats of the Amazon : III . That 's because my excuse involves ghosts , demons , two of my former wives , and a defrocked exorcist . Not , for various reasons , things I can safely discuss openly . It 's been my experience , after making a comfortable , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , that the average moviegoer does n't pay much attention to writing credits . Therefore my name would n't produce a shock of recognition from most people . Anyway , I 'm Frank Kennison and I specialize in horror movies . I wrote Devil Bats of the Amazon and its sequel Devil Bats of the Amazon : II . That latter one was nominated for an Oscar . Not , unfortunately , for my screenplay but for the Special Effects . Still , I can legitimately say that I 'm associated with an Oscar-nominated film . Which I do in all my bios . Some of my other movies , which do very well on the budget DVD market , include Nosebleed , Nosebleed II , The Invisible Mummy , The Mysterious Carton of Chinese Noodles ( an unfortunate title the distributor stuck on my adaptation of a very scary Chinese movie ) , and The Return of the Cannibal Coeds , the thriller that introduced Betsy Donwin to the screen . Betsy was my first wife and has only a little to do with this current mess . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cute kid books about the Incontinent Kitten , who was a major contributor to screwing up my life , entangling me with real supernatural stuff , and causing me to fall behind on this script that I owe Pentagram Pictures . I was married to Carolyn for just shy of three years . She 's my third and most recent ex-wife and it was , basically , because she inherited a gloomy Victorian mansion in the hills above the Southern California coastal town of Santa Rita Beach that I experienced all the troubles listed above . Over the years I 've written several screenplays about malignant old houses , including The Emeryville Horror , The Thing in the Septic Tank , and Fatal Mortgage . But that was all fiction that fit into a traditional spooky movie genre and I never , until now , believed that such houses existed . Then Carolyn reinserted herself into my life by way of a message that I found waiting for me on my cell phone when I got back into my eleven-year-old Mercedes ( bought when my income was somewhat more comfortable than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very low budget producer . That was on a gray Thursday toward the end of October . The message , unlike many of Carolyn 's recent communications , was fairly cordial . In that precise , slightly nasal voice of hers , she said , " I hope , Frank dear , you 'll forgive the unkind things I said during our chance encounter on La Cienega a couple of months ago . Since you 're an expert on matters occult , darling , I 'm turning to you for help . This damned mansion of mine has .... Oh , my god , I- " Her words stopped abruptly and were followed by a long , heartfelt scream . The phone went dead . When I tried to call Carolyn , I got no answer . Not even from her answering machine . Her hillside mansion in Santa Rita Beach was just one town away . A drive , even in a Mercedes of diminished capacity , of a little over twenty minutes . I decided , since she was n't someone given to frivolous screaming , to drive over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only my first error of judgment . Anybody who 's seen more than one haunted house movie , let alone a guy who 's written fourteen of the things thus far in his career , knows you should n't walk into any old dark mansion where you find the front door partly open if you 're interested in avoiding trouble . I walked right into Carolyn 's recently inherited mansion , however , despite the fact that the thick oaken door was standing at least a foot open . For one thing , it had commenced raining midway through my drive over , heavy aggressive rain . Beside the fact that I was eager to get in out of the downpour , I was very curious to learn what had happened to her . I seem to take an unfortunate interest in the wellbeing of most of my former wives . " Carolyn ? " I called out as I entered the long , dark-paneled hallway . It was dimlit and there was a strong , pervasive odor of brimstone . To my knowledge , I 've never actually smelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was smelling . " Carolyn ? " I took a few tentative steps along the faded Persian hall carpet and chanced to look into the parlor , also dimlit , on my right . " Holy shit , " I observed . Carolyn , who 's a slim blonde woman of thirty-one , was floating about three feet above the venerable hardwood floor . She was unconscious , her long hair disheveled , and wearing only some lingerie the color of lemon curd . As I crossed the parlor threshold , I bumped into a clawfoot table , causing a vase full of dried pussywillows to teeter , then go hopping downward to the floor . From somewhere a few feet above my floating , supine , erstwhile wife , came an annoyed grumbling sound , followed by brief blurred shimmering and a loud popping . Then Carolyn dropped to the floor , landing on a somewhat tattered throw-rug and sending up a thin spurt of pale gray dust . Sprinting , I knelt beside her , took hold of one of her wrists and began rubbing it vigorously . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I 've used it frequently in my scripts for similar incidents . She was breathing in what struck me as a normal way . I noticed , even in the dim light of the late afternoon parlor , that there were reddish marks on both her bare arms and others on her freckled left shoulder . Carolyn moaned at the same instant that I became aware that my left foot was entangled in some son of cloth . Turning , I discovered it was a pair of the warm-up pants she always wore when she was writing . Beside them , in a wrinkled sprawl , was one of her faded UCLA sweatshirts . " Frank , " she said in a faraway voice as she opened her eyes . " You ca n't imagine what just happened . " " Judging by the evidence , you were partially undressed by an invisible man , " I suggested , helping her to sit up . " Do n't be dopey . It was a ghost and he was in the process of assaulting me , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Has this happened before ? " She shook her head , carefully . " No , today was the first time , " Carolyn replied . " Though he 's been lurking around the place for close to three weeks . " I , in my most gentlemanly manner , aided my partially clothed ex-wife to make her way over to the Victorian loveseat near the narrow stone fireplace . After helping her to get comfortably seated , I gathered up her scattered garments and handed them to her . " Is this a ghost that comes with the mansion ? " Carolyn frowned , touching at a tender spot on her shoulder . " Not exactly , Frank , no . " She accepted the bundle of clothes , then dropped them on the loveseat beside her . " Not exactly ? " " Well now , dear , do n't go having a fit and playing the jealous husband when I explain that - " " Hey , I have n't been your husband , jealous or otherwise , for almost two long , blissful years , Carrie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bentwood rocker facing her . " But considering the number of times you cheated on me during our tumultuous marriage , raising my voice now and then was certainly justified and - " " Two or three teeny affairs and you treated me as though I were Madame Bovary or some dreadful woman left over from a Tolstoy novel . " " Who just attacked you ? " " A ghost . " " You already stated that . " She sighed , draped the old UCLA sweatshirt across her thighs . " A divorced woman gets lonely , " Carolyn began . " Especially during the dry spells when I 'm not in the throes of creating another Incontinent Kitten potential bestseller . So ! ... well , availed myself of a few computer dating services in order to meet a few interesting new men . And one of them son of moved in with me about six months ago . " " That was this ghost ? " " Nitwit , he was n't a ghost then . " " Details ? " She sighed yet again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tall and very good looking , an excellent gourmet cook and very handy around the house , " she continued . " Unlike you , dear , Ulrich was a wiz at carpentry and there was n't an electrical or plumbing problem , and this place had lots of them , that he could n't solve . He - " " Ulrich ? You were shacked up with somebody named Ulrich ? " " It 's a perfectly acceptable old name . In Germany there are , I 'd guess , legions of Ulrichs . The name is probably as common as Frank . " " And his last name ? " She hesitated , then answered , quietly , " Well , it was Zillbusher . " " You were shacked up with somebody named Ulrich Zillbusher ? " " Let me get on with explaining the terrifying situation I find myself in right now today , Frank dear . " " In moments of passion what did you cry out ? Ulrich , Ulrich ? Or Zillbusher , Zillbusher ? " Ignoring me , Carolyn went on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . And , later on , that he had some strange interests . " " Sexual interests ? " " Those , too , but worse yet , he was into black magic , sorcery , the summoning of demons from the netherworld , Satanic rituals and - " " Wait , whoa , " I cut in . " Ulrich practiced all this stuff right here in this ramshackle mansion you inherited last year from your Great Aunt Marie ? " " Right here on the premises , yes . " " How exactly did Ulrich become a ghost ? " " Well , that process began while I was suggesting that he pack up and get the hell out of here and troll the Net for a new sweetie , " Carolyn told me . " Perhaps one who would put up with his sexual aggressiveness as well as his unhealthy interest in the supernatural . " " By that time stuff like Devil worship had no doubt warped his - " " He became enraged and attempted to grab me , " she continued . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " A meat grinder , " Carolyn answered . " You know , one of those oldfashioned ones that you screw on the edge of a table and they weigh an awful lot . It belonged to my great aunt . " " Sure , I used a meat grinder like that in Guess Which Zombie 's Coming To Dinner for Pentagram back in 1989 , " I said , nodding . " So you conked the guy with one when he attempted to assault you . That 's clearly self-defense . I assume your attorney - that sleek son of a bitch who got you such an onerous divorce settlement despite your - " " I never went to the police , " she explained . " I mean , innocent though I was , I wanted to avoid the media 's getting hold of the story .

" " And much too long for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So what happened to Ulrich ? " Very slowly , she pointed down at the floor . " These old Victorians have immense basements . " " You buried the body in the basement ? " " I could n't very well bury him in the front yard . " " True . When was all this ? " " This past August . The twenty-second to be exact . " As a recent convert to a belief in ghosts , I then asked , " And when did his spirit start haunting you , Carolyn ? " " Exactly three weeks ago today . " " Are there occasions when you can actually see the guy ? When I got here , he was invisible . " " Well , Ulrich goes in and out of focus . Sometimes he shows up looking just about as he did when he was extant , " she replied . " Others I can only infer that he 's about the house . No matter what phase he 's in , I can always hear his heavy , horny breathing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Snuffling must be hard to do through a ghostly nose . " " Will you quit making wiseass remarks ? " my former wife requested . " The reason I phoned you earlier , Frank , even though we have n't been on exactly friendly terms lately , was that you 're an expert on the occult and the supernatural because of writing all those cheesy movies . I need your help to get rid of Ulrich 's vengeful ghost . " IN MANY of my movies , especially those featuring an invulnerable and undying serial killer , there 's always the possibility that the threat 'll return later in a film with a II or a III someplace in the title . Life , too , can sometimes go in for sequels . On that gray rainswept afternoon that I inadvertently rescued Carolyn from the ghost of Ulrich Zillbusher I voluntarily got ensnared with her once more . Yeah , I found myself agreeing to move into her gloomy old Victorian mansion for a while . " He dare not materialize with you here , Frank dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay wo n't be a long-term thing , since as an expert on occult matters , you 'll be able to clear my house of Ulrich in a jiffy . " " The bodyguard part I can handle , " I said . " But remember that I only write about ghost busters , Carolyn . I do n't actually practice ghost busting . " " Listen , I have faith in you , " she assured me . " While we were married , you often accused me , in that loud voice you assume when you 're deeply ticked off , of not having faith in you . But you can see that here and now I 'm being completely supportive . " " Your lack of faith in my talent as a writer was what I was complaining about , " I said . " But , okay , all right , I 'll spend a few days under your roof and I 'll try to come up with a way to eject Ulrich . " Right there I had committed two more fateful errors . You should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who 'd proven her incompatibility in myriad ways . And , having no real life experience with unearthly things , you should n't promise to exterminate a ghost . " I 'm really glad you 've agreed to come back into my life , dear . " She jumped up from the loveseat , losing the sweatshirt that had been draped across her legs , and came , barefooted , over to the rocker . " I know that I 'm going to be eternally grateful to you for clearing up this awful situation . " When she sat on my lap and hugged me , the bentwood rocker began rocking vigorously . As darkness fell on the haunted mansion , I committed yet another mistake . But by the time I realized it , I 'd been in bed with Carolyn for nearly an hour and it was too late . Putting her lips close to my bad ear , she whispered warmly , " You 're much gentler than Ulrich . " " King Kong is much gentler than Ulrich . " She sighed in my ear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Okay , I accept it as - " " Oh , damn , " she exclaimed , sitting up and emerging from beneath Great Aunt Marie 's crazy quilt . I heard the sound now , too . I had the impression that someone was , very slowly , dragging a wheelbarrow full of scrap metal up the wooden stairs to the second floor . " What the devil is that , Carrie ? " " We should 've discussed this earlier , " she said , staring at the closed door of the master bedroom . " I 'm pretty sure this is Urgh Zgrun . " The clanging and rattling was growing louder and closer . " Another of your Internet beaus ? " I was leaning over the edge of the four-poster , groping around on the floor for my discarded shirt . " Oh , it 's one of the demons Ulrich summoned up to do his bidding . They do n't seem to have gone away even though he 's deceased . " " One of ? " " There are three of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But Shug Ngryz and Grb Shogov look an awful lot alike-big , green , and scaly - and they may be the same demon from the netherworld under two names . " " Is this one who 's fast approaching likely to attack us ? " " Probably not , " she replied without complete conviction . " I 've tried to explain to them that Ulrich is as departed as anyone can be and they do n't have to hang around anymore , " she said , her teeth faintly chattering . " I 'm afraid though that he still controls them even in his ghost state and he 's using them to harass me . And now you . " Fetching up my shirt , I placed it over her bare shoulders . " Let me see if I can negotiate with - " " Frank Kennilworth , " boomed a huge gravelly voice from just beyond the heavy door . " He means you , " she said , nudging me in the ribs . " You 'd think a demon from the netherworld would get my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the demon at the door . " I bring a warning , rash mortal . " " Okay , " I responded in a dim voice not quite like my own . " Leave this house within one more day or meet your terrible doom ! " The sound of heavy scrap metal being dragged back downstairs started up and quickly grew faint . " What produces that noise this demon makes ? " " He 's got a lot of spiky protrusions and big hard scales . They flap and clank while he lumbers along . " " Lumbers ? He does n't simply walk ? " She nodded . " I 'm really sorry , Frank . It looks like Ulrich 's ghost wants you out of here so he can have me to himself again . Apparently he 's using these demon buddies of his to scare you . " " He 's been fairly successful . " " But you wo n't desert me , dear ? " I shook my head . " Nope , " I assured my former wife . " But I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit . Hopefully he 'll take his assorted demons with him when he departs . " She sighed , putting both arms tight around me . " I appreciate that , Frank . " Okay , one more dangerous error of judgment . I 'm an early riser , Carolyn is n't . By seven the next morning , while she was still slumbering under the multicolored quilt , I was descending to the kitchen and thinking about how to remedy the deplorable situation in which I found myself . What I needed , and soon , was expert help . Help of the son Carolyn was convinced I was capable of delivering . There was a priest I 'd interviewed three years ago who claimed to be a first-rate exorcist . At the time I did n't believe the guy , but he did give me some good ideas for my 1996 movie A Room With A Ghost . I 'd phone Father Bray right after breakfast . Maybe before breakfast was a better idea , I was thinking as I stepped into the big white kitchen . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red-haired young woman who was sitting at the heavy walnut kitchen table . Both her hands were clutching a cup of Starbucks coffee . I inquired , " Betsy , what brings you here ? The alimony payments you 're still gouging out of me are being sent on time and - " " Damned if I know , " admitted Betsy Donwin , my first wife . She was wearing a white cable-stitch sweater and tan jeans and looking perplexed . " One minute I 'm sitting in a Starbucks on Wilshire and then , bang , I 'm here . How 'd you work this nasty little trick , Frank ? " I sat , gingerly , across the round wide table from her . " I 'll be honest with you , Betsy - " I began . " That 's more than you were able to be during our lousy , and fortunately short , marriage , " she mentioned . " Hey , let 's not forget that , for all of my faults , I made you a star . " " You made me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until my agent got me out of those crappy movies of yours that my career blossomed and I became a major player . Which I still am , again no thanks to you , dear heart . " " What we have to figure out , Betsy , is how and why you - " " Attend to me , vile mortal , " she said in a new , deep and profoundly raspy voice . I noticed that her coffee had started to boil and bubble and was spilling up over the lip of the container . " Shit , you 've obviously been taken over by a demon , " I realized . " I used a similar device in Invasion of the Shapechangers in 2001 , but I never , until now - " " Cease your prattle , Frank Kennison , " ordered Betsy . " I am Shug Ngryz and I have taken control of this frail creature 's body in order to deliver another warning to you . " " Urgh Zgrun - I 'm only guessing since I never got a look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true form . " " My true form , misguided creature , is many times more horrible than that of Urgh Zgrun , quite a bit more horrendous . A man of your advanced years gazing on my true form for the first time might well die of fright . " " Is n't that what you want me to do ? " I asked . " And , hey , I 'm only thirty-eight , which is n't an especially advanced - " " You 're forty-three , " spoke the demon inside my first wife . " We do n't wish you to pass away , Frank . As a favor to our departed master , we simply want you to vacate so that he can continue his spectral courting of the fair ... Jesus , have I got a sore throat . " That last line was in Betsy 's own smoky voice . " Have you been able to hear what Shug Ngryz was - " " I sure have , Frank , and it sounds to me like you 're in deep trouble . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tabletop . " How about being useful for a change and getting something to wipe up this mess ? " I rose from my chair , grabbed one of Great Aunt Marie 's embroidered dish towels off a wall hook and started rubbing at the pool of coffee . " Lost contact for a moment there , " said the voice of the demon . " As I was explaining to you , Frank my friend , pack your bags and flee or the vengeance of Ulrich Zillbusher will descend upon you . " " Actually I do n't have any bags to pack . I have n't had time , what with one thing and another , to get over to my place in Bayside to gather my laptop and a few - " " Begone , " advised the demon . " Or be prepared to .... " After a few seconds , Betsy got up , a bit wobbly . " Frank , it 's been nice to see you again . But the next time a demon wants to communicate with you , tell him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ? " " I suppose so , since Shug Ngryz has apparently left for good . " I walked with her to the kitchen doorway . " Do you need cab fare ? " " Are n't you going to drive me back to Starbucks ? " " I 'd better stay here to look after Carolyn , just in case a demon - " " You back with that bitch ? " Shaking her head , she started down the long shadowy hallway . " A big mistake , Frank . " " I did n't , actually , have a choice . And it is n't going to be a long term - " " If the demons do n't get you , let me know how all this turns out . " She took hold of the big brass door knob on the street door . " But phone me , do n't try to drop around in person . I 'm not that interested in your fate . " Opening the door , she went down the steps and away into the misty gray morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track down Father Matthew Bray . That was because he was no longer a priest . Finally , about ten that morning , I got help from a friend of mine who writes the religious news column for the Bayside News-Pilot . " They tossed Bray out of his parish , " Dan Bookman informed me . " Then he was excommunicated . " " Some sort of sex scandal ? " " No , Father Bray was simply a crook and they found out he 'd swiped something like $63,000 from his church , " Bookman said . " They did n't prosecute and he 's still at liberty . Why do you want him ? " " I find myself in need of an exorcist . " " You still writing those cheap horror flicks , huh ? " No use trying to explain that one of my ex-wives was being haunted . " Exactly . I 'm in the middle of a new script for Pentagram and need some technical stuff . " " I thought Pentagram went belly up last winter . " " They got bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How can I get in touch with Bray ? " " The reverend is now running an outfit he calls Supernatural Detective Services . It 's in Santa Monica . Look him up in the directory . " I hung up and did just that . When Carolyn came down for breakfast at a little after eleven , looking attractive in a candy-striped blouse and a short gray skirt , I filled her in about what had been happening . " This Father Bray charges how much ? " she asked as she popped two frozen wheat-free waffles into her toaster oven . " Ninety-five dollars per hour . " " Could n't you talk him down ? " " I did . He usually charges a hundred twenty . " She turned her back on the toaster oven . " Maybe we should try for somebody else . " " He 's probably the best man for the job , " I told her . " He 'll arrive after ten tonight . " " So late ? " " Bray says the best time for exorcising is after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Okay , let 's hope he 's not full of crap .

" " Father Bray suggests you hang a wreath of garlic around your neck . That should protect you during the few hours I 'm not here . " " C'm on , every ninny knows that garlic scares off vampires , not ghosts or demons . " " Bray says it 's a little known fact , but garlic is also effective with spirits from the beyond and demons from the netherworld . " " How the hell am I going to create a necklace of garlic ? " She placed the two waffles on a plate , carried them to the table . " What I 've got in the house is two dinky cloves of the stuff . " " That should do for a few-hour stretch . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Fifteen minutes later , as I was guiding my Mercedes homeward , my agent contacted me on my cell phone .

Now , about the script for - " " Ah , then you have n't been struck with sudden amnesia , " he cut in . " You have n't been kidnapped by terrorists and held for ransom . In fact , you do n't have one single goddamn reason for being late on Devil Bats of the Amazon : IV . " " Three , Lew . We 're only up to the third one . " " You know I always vet your scripts before I deliver them , " my agent reminded me in a disgruntled voice . " Your first draft was supposed to be on my desk yesterday , schmuck .

She 's the least abominable of your team of shrews . All right , putz , I expect the script by Friday , early . Pentagram has to have it no later than November One . Farewell . " I returned to the gloomy mansion just before two in the afternoon . While I was setting down my suitcase , attach case , and laptop in the shadowy corridor , I heard two voices talking in the parlor . Striding in there , I found Carolyn drinking wine with a bald , suntanned man of about fifty . " Christ , the demon has assumed another human form , " I exclaimed .

" " He was concerned about me , " she explained . " You see , before I called you yesterday , I e-mailed Phil to tell him about some of my supernatural concerns . " " Is he a leftover from the louts you were seeing on the sly during our marriage or - " " Phil is a new friend and you need n't act like a - " " Say , folks , " said Phil , setting his wine glass on a clawfooted table and easing toward the doorway , " I 'd best be leaving .

" AFTER I UNPACKED in the second floor bedroom Carolyn had assigned me for my ( hopefully brief ) stay , I set up my laptop on a heavy oaken dressing table . I was planning to get started by rereading the last few pages of Devil Bats of the Amazon : HI that I 'd written . But as I was scrolling along toward the page where I 'd left off , I chanced accidentally to read what it said on the rest of the pages . " Jesus H. Christ , " I remarked , pressing both my hands to the tabletop and staring at the screen . Someone had done major tampering with my copy . EXT .

" My computer produced a low explosive noise , then a hill color moving image of a raging forest fire filled the screen . An animated cartoon featuring Little Orphan Annie took the fire 's place . " To borrow from Ethel Barrymore , " she said . " That 's all there is , there is n't any more . " The screen went black . Hunching over the laptop , I tried every retrieval method I knew or had even heard about to try finding my lost copy . But the hundred and three pages of my nearly completed script failed to show up . I slumped back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead screen . Black and white footage of the Oval Office at the White House came up . What was probably the Marine Band commenced playing " Hail to the Chief . " The President of the United States sauntered into the room and seated himself . Briefly assuming an Uncle-Sam-wants-you pose , he pointed at me . " My advisers who advise me on paranormal matters , Frank , " he drawled , " have advised me that it 's just not smart to mess around with demons or Ulrich Zillbusher . If I was you , I 'd scram while you can . Sometimes withdrawal is the wisest course . " My laptop shivered , swayed , produced a series of lugubrious burps , and jumped clean off the table . After a few stunned seconds , I remembered that I had my script notes and quite a few hard copy pages of an earlier draft in my attach case . I hurried over to the four poster . The mattress was covered with another of Great Aunt Marie 's multicolored quilts . My case sat smack in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lid popped up before I could touch the case . Chocolate-colored smoke came billowing up to swirl around my head . Lunging , I grabbed the handle . " Yow ! " It was incredibly hot . I stumbled back until I bumped into a wall . From inside the open attach case came the sound of paper crackling and burning , plus the acrid smell of plastic melting and sizzling . Every trace of my overdue script was gone now . " I 'll have to start from scratch , " I told myself . " And finish by Friday . " Hurried footsteps sounded in the corridor outside . Carolyn arrived in the room . Wrinkling her nose , scowling , she inquired , " What 's happening ? " " Demons , " I replied . Wearing a simple black cocktail dress that she 'd changed into after dinner , Carolyn entered the parlor at about 9:30 . She was carrying a thick ancient leather-bound book . " Ulrich collected a great many odd books , of which this is by far the oddest , Frank . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Funny . " " Are you sensing that Ulrich 's ghost is in the vicinity ?

" I left the rocker to examine the book . " ' The Dark , Forbidden and Most Accursed Prolegomena to the Study of the Black Art of Summoning and Mastering Demons from the Fiery Pits of the Netherworld , ' " I read aloud . " Catchy title . " " It 's an early eighteenth-century reprint of a much earlier work attributed to the notorious sorcerer Count Monstrodamus . " " Yeah , I see his name here on the cover . They call him , " The Vile and Infamous Disciple of the Prince of Darkness and Foul Master of the Black Arts Who Was Burned at the Stake for his Blasphemous Practices . ' " " Ulrich found the count 's writings , while a bit verbose , very useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she explained , sitting qn the loveseat . " It was Ulrich 's belief that if you could get a powerful demon working for you , every sort of success would come your way . And he explained to me how certain spells worked . " I asked her , " Why 'd you bring the book down here now ? " " Use your head , dummy . Father Bray will obviously want to consult it , " she told me . " In addition to very effective spells for summoning demons , there are also spells for sending them away . I 've browsed through this book quite a few times and I 'm certain that any occult expert would find Count Monstrodamus 's book helpful in - " " A nice thought , hon , " remarked the small , white-haired man standing now in the parlor doorway . His hair was close-cropped and the pockets of his black priest-style suit were full of small objects ( one of which was making small croaking sounds ) . Under his left arm he was holding a large , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carolyn had brought . " How 'd you get in ? " she asked the exorcist . Bray smiled . " I think I 've finally mastered the art of teleportation , my dear , " he said " Last time I tried it , I was attempting to call on a client in Bel Air but I ended up at an overly quaint soda fountain down in Disneyland with a sweaty lad in a Mickey Mouse suit giving me a welcoming hug . " " What 's that book you 're lugging with you ? " she asked him . He lifted Ulrich 's book off the able , dropping it to the faded Persian carpet . " This book of yours , my dear , while serviceable , is the abridged 1803 Lisbon edition and lacks several important spells as well as Count Monstrodamus 's brilliant essay on how to name demons . Mine is the rarer 1733 Paris edition . Only 230 copies were printed , twenty-five of them , it is rumored , bound in human skin . " He replaced Ulrich 's book with his . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any - " " Ulrich was quite probably a dimbulb , " the defrocked priest told her , reaching down to tap the massive red leather cover . " Whereas Count Monstrodamus was an extremely gifted magus . A shame , in a way , that they hanged him before he reached the age of fifty . " I pointed a thumb at the book he 'd dumped on the rug . " Says there that he was burned at the stake . " " They tried to knock him off that way , but he escaped , " said Bray , eyeing me for a few silent seconds . " You 've gone further to seed since I lent you a hand on that quintessential turkey , There 's a Ghost in My Room . A man approaching fifty , my boy , ought to exercise more and cut down on the carbs and booze . " " A Room with a Ghost was the title , Father , " I corrected . " And I 'm only approaching forty-two . " " Alas , then you 're in even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " interrupted Carolyn , " could we , please , get back to the business that I 'm paying you such an inflated price for ? How are you planning to rid my mansion of - " " Forgive my digressions , ma'am . " Reaching deep into one of the lumpy pockets of his rumpled black suit , Bray extracted a folded sheet of yellow memo paper . " I 've written out an itinerary . " As he unfolded the memo , a small grayish toad came wiggling up out of the coat pocket he 'd just dipped into . Emitting a single forlorn croak , it sprang to the floor , bounced upon landing , then hopped off into the shadows beyond the fireplace . Carolyn , perturbed , asked , " Why are you carrying that poor little thing around with you ? " " You 'd be surprised how many spells call for a toad . " " I sure hope you are n't planning to sacrifice any living creatures in my parlor . " " Suppose , " I suggested , " we get on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process of so doing . " Bray paused to scowl in my direction before returning his attention to his itinerary for the evening . " Prior to ridding you of any lingering demons , Ms. Barnes , I intend to search the mansion for a trace of the spectral manifestation who 's been annoying you . Once I locate the wraith of Ulrich Zillbusher , I 'll swiftly dispatch him to the hereafter and - " " I 'll save you some time , asshole . Here I am . " Completely visible , the ghost of Carolyn 's dead boyfriend was standing in the parlor doorway , arms spread wide . " And you , padre , are the one who 's going to get dispatched . " Ulrich was large and wide , his shaggy blond hair worn long . His nose had been broken at some point in his lifetime and his chin was n't as prominent as it might 've been . For some reason he was wearing polka-dot pajamas . This was my first encounter with an actual ghost and for all I knew all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still , it struck me as odd and I knew I would never dress a ghost in any of my movies in polka-dot pajamas , especially a pair with legs that ended an inch or so below the knee . Inhaling sharply , Carolyn watched wide-eyed as Ulrich eased farther into the parlor . Unobtrusively , I moved closer to my former wife . " Why the pajamas ? " I inquired quietly . " His idea of a joke , " she whispered . " I gave them to him in happier times . " The ghost pointed a spectral finger at me . " So this is your ex , Carolyn ? " he said . " Even Phil is an improvement over him . " " Enough of this . " Father Bray 's voice sounding even more Irish , he brought the yellow memo up closer to his eyes . " Okay , we 'll start with the Holy Water . " While our exorcist was patting one of his coat pockets , Ulrich took two ghostly steps in our direction . " I can tear you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Or you can haul ass and leave Carolyn to me . Your choice , buddy . " " You are n't going to be on this plane of existence long enough to do much tearing of anybody 's limb - " " Why have you got your Holy Water in an Evian bottle ? " asked Carolyn , who was gazing over in Bray 's direction . " It is Evian . " He twisted off the cap . " Much purer than tap water , chlorine-free and no salt . I bless it myself , same as I did back in my priestly days . " Grunting once , Ulrich spun around . " Okay , Kennison , I 'll have to take care of this defrocked dude first . " He moved across the parlor toward Father Bray . " I think not . " He threw the contents of the bottle at the approaching specter . When the first drops hit Ulrich , his polka-dot pajamas commenced to smoke , sending off thin foul-smelling yellowish tendrils . " Candle , candle , " Bray urged himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same pocket that had contained the memo and the toad , he took a squat yellow votive candle . Ulrich , smoking impressively from head to toe , staggered closer to the exorcist . Bray lit his candle with a wooden match dug out of another pocket . Grasping it in his right hand , he held it straight out and recited what was apparently a spell he knew by heart . Much of it seemed to be in Latin . I caught the names of several religious and occult entities , plus a few interpolated English words and phrases , such as depart , abandon , and hit the road . Ulrich halted in his lurching approach to Bray . He was swaying now , engulfed in thickening swirls of smoke and making faint annoyed grunts . Our exorcist tossed the burning candle at the now-flickering specter . When the flame passed through the fading ghost 's polka-dot-clad figure , Ulrich 's ghost vanished and a substantial explosion occurred . The explosion was of sufficient force to shove Carolyn and me back against the parlor wall . The table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up off the floor . The big leather-bound book went spinning through the smoky air to whap Father Bray hard across the forehead . He yelped once before toppling over , hitting the carpet , and passing out . Shivering , Carolyn hugged me and sighed . " Well , that takes care of Ulrich , " she said , relieved . " But not us , " announced the largest , greenest , and most repulsive of the three demons who 'd materialized in the center of the room . His scaly head bumped the dangling crystal chandelier . Carolyn hugged me more tightly , sighed more deeply and increased her rate of shivering . " Our first demand , " announced the demon spokesperson , " is that you revive your sprawled cleric and instruct him to reverse his exorcism . " " I have no intention of doing that , " Carolyn informed him defiantly . " Not after all we went through to get rid of Ulrich in the first place . " " We wish him back , " demanded the demon , who I assumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lot . To further indicate that he was ticked off , he stomped on the carpet with a scaly clawed foot . A smoldering patch of rug , the size of Shug Ngryz 's right foot , resulted . Another of the demons , who possessed , I now noticed , a long forked tail , warned , " If you do not obey us , we shall devour you . " In addition to a forked tail , he also had a great many large , very sharp teeth . Carolyn , her face very close to mine , said in a low voice , " Cause a diversion . I 'll get to Ulrich 's copy of Monstrodamus and use one of the spells . " I gave a very discreet nod , then pushed her aside and shouted , " No , Carrie , we must capitulate to these guys . " I walked nearer to the green trio . " I 'll get to work reviving Father Bray . " " You have made a wise decision , worthless mortal , " commended the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of steps in the direction of the still unconscious occultist , then faked a sprawling fall over the tipped clawfoot table . Regaining my balance , flapping my arms to maintain it , I went staggering beyond Bray and bumped into another of the parlor 's many clawfoot tables . That fell over , causing the stuffed owl that had been perched atop it to slam into the rickety Chinese screen in front of one of the shuttered windows . Impatient , the fork-tailed demon observed , " You 're annoyingly clumsy . " A foot-long burst of flame shot out of his mouth along with the angry words . When I 'd weaved my way back to Bray , I knelt beside him and pressed my palm to his chest . " Good lord ! " I exclaimed . " He 's stone cold dead ! " Bray somewhat spoiled the effect by moaning at that point , loudly , and sitting up to glance around him . He noticed the demons , all of whom had been watching my progress and were now producing roars that indicated disappointment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy ? " " Basically a sere wed-up diversion . " At the other side of the parlor Carolyn grabbed up the book and was opening it to the spell she wanted . My diversionary tactics ceased to be effective just then and Shug Ngryz 's head turned toward Carolyn . He glared at her . " Foolish wench ! " he shouted , pointing a scaly forefinger at her . A ribbon of flame , this one about six feet long , came crackling out of his mouth . The flames fell about a dozen feet short of reaching my onetime wife . But they did set fire to one of the Chinese screens . " Duck ! " I suggested and at the same time yanked up an imitation leather hassock and hurled it right at the tire-spouting Shug Ngryz . Carolyn executed an impressive back flip , the Count Monstrodamus book clutched to her breast , and ducked behind a sofa . The demon lost his balance , fell over on his backside with a huge thump . That caused another smoldering patch on the carpet . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including a white-beaded Rosary and a frayed scapula , and was waving them at the other two demons in an effort to distract them . Carolyn began reading a spell . Bray now looked from Carolyn 's sofa to the demons to me . " Faith , Kennison , she 's fair mangling the Latin , " he pointed out . " Not to mention the Sanskrit and the Portuguese . " " Best keep silent for a moment , " I advised . The demons kept producing more angry roars . Then two of them commenced shrinking in size . " Ah , it 's the Count 's famous spell that shrinks them down till there 's nary a trace left , " observed Bray . " Not the one I 'd have chosen , yet reasonably dependable . Even her butchering of the pronunciation does n't rob it of its effectiveness . " Shug Ngryz was also diminishing , but at a much slower rate . He took two shaky steps in Carolyn 's direction , small spurts of crimson flame dribbling out of his green mouth . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demons , now less than a foot high , produced , in turn , loud popping sounds and vanished . Carolyn , reaching the end of the spell , slammed the big book shut . When Shug Ngryz reached a height of roughly four feet , he all at once turned into a nearly soundless green explosion , becoming a greenish cloud of demonic dust . Recalling one of my favorite script lines , I remarked , " That was a close call and we 're lucky to be alive . " " Oh , I do n't know , " said Carolyn with a gratified smile . " It was n't all that difficult . Had I known I had a real knack for this sort of thing , I would n't have had to hire an occult detective at all . " " Keep in mind , my dear , that it was I who removed your lecherous ghost , " Father Bray reminded . " You did , yes , " she acknowledged . " I 'll pay you for that . " She glanced at me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Less than a half hour , I 'd estimate . Even so , I 'll write him a check for , say , fifty percent of ninety-five dollars , and - " " A moment , my dear . My minimum fee is ninety-five bucks . Plus you owe me twenty-five dollars for travel expenses , nineteen ninety-five for the holy water , and the toad will run you - " " I 'll find your damn toad and ship him home to you , " she assured him . " As for the holy water , I 'll buy you a bottle of Evian and you can bless it at your leisure . " " But , dear lady , that - " " I 'll send you a check for all the rest of your expenses , Father , " I promised . " You may be a second-rate writer , but you 're a first-rate gentleman . " Gathering up his book and his equipment , Bray took his leave . Carolyn , while straightening up the parlor , said , " Stupid to offer to pay him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ulrich was worth it . " " I suppose you 're right , Frank . " Sitting down on the loveseat , she arranged her copy of the Count Monstrodamus book on the coffee table . " You know , I really do seem to have a talent for this supernatural business . Being around Ulrich , I picked up quite a lot of - " " Whoa , Carrie . I 've written enough movies to know that it 's not wise to mess around with things like this . " " I 'm pretty certain I can do better than Ulrich , " she persisted . " I could summon up a milder demon . One that would do my bidding and not be as surly as Shug Ngryz . " " You really ca n't deal with demons , " I warned . " Besides , I doubt you can find a mild-mannered one . " " My Incontinent Kitten books do very well , but demonic help could make them even bigger sellers and win me the literary prizes that I deserve , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are at least three bestselling authors right here in the Greater Los Angeles area who made deals with demons and now they 're rolling in - " " Forget about this . " " And I 've got to tell you , dear , nothing short of supernatural assistance is going to get you a big budget movie deal . " " No , nope , Carolyn . " I said from the rocker where I 'd perched . " Anyhow , I 've got to get back to my place now to get to work on Devil Bats of the Amazon : HI . " " C'm on , Frank . " She came over to join me on the chair , causing it to creak and sway . " Considering all you 've been through , you might as well stay here tonight . " After a moment ( somewhat like the one where Dr. Frankenstein is persuaded to once again revive his monster ) I replied , " I suppose so , sure . " She laughed softly , hugging me . " I 'm sure you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Most times at the end of a movie all the threads are tied up , all the problems solved , lovers are together , killers are in prison . The words The End then appear on the screen and everybody goes home , happy , while the final credits are unrolling . In many of my films , the ones where the monster is going to return in another sequel , I do n't do that . I use a tag that I 'm afraid maybe I ought to use now . The End ... Or Is It ?
