The PGA championship adds a splash of Irish this month at Whistling Straits , a grand , bruising links course on Lake Michigan where the only thing harder than the closing holes is finding a pro who has played them . Turn the page to learn more about that fearsome finishing stretch and why 2004 's final major will be full of surprises . DYE HARD  --  At 7,597 yards  --  nearly five miles  --  Whistling Straits will be the longest course in major championship history . But Pete Dye 's awe-inspiring layout on Lake Michigan is short on history . The only tournament played on the Straits was the 1999 PGA Club Professional Championship . Jeff Freeman , now on the Nationwide Tour , won with a modest 1-under-par 287 . Freeman birdied the last four holes to close his first round , but do n't expect a similar charge at this year 's PGA Championship . The Straits ' blustery , brutal closing holes will have the leaders simply trying to hang on . " People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played this course all summer long , " says defending champion Shaun Micheel 3RD HOLE " O'MAN " 181 YARDS , PAR 3 5TH HOLE " SNAKE " 598 YARDS , PAR 5 10TH HOLE " VOYAGEUR " 361 YARDS , PAR 4 11TH HOLE " SAND BOX " 618 YARDS , PAR 5  --  13TH HOLE " CLIFF HANGER " 404 YARDS , PAR 4  --  14TH HOLE " WIDOW 'S WATCH " 373 YARDS , PAR 4  --  15TH HOLE " GRAND STRAND " 518 YARDS , PAR 4 The longest par 4 in major championship history is 19 yards longer than the notorious 12th at Bethpage Black in the 2002 U.S. Open . Short knockers might aim for the walkway in the rough . WHAT 'S MY LINE ?  --  THE APPROACH IS DECEPTIVE : The only things players will see behind the flag are big sky and a big lake . DALY 'S DREAM  --  In the unlikely event of a helping breeze , long hitters can try to blast it over the bunkers that pinch the fairway 320 yards from the tee . It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's 240 yards to reach the fairway  --  dead into the wind . " Players will not be able to reach this fairway into a 15-to 20-mile-an-hour wind , " says Micheel . " I do n't know what they are going to do . " If it really blows , the tee will be moved up . 16TH HOLE " ENDLESS BITE " 569 YARDS , PAR 5 The only real birdie chance on the closing quartet . Into the wind , this is a three-shot hole for the entire field . LAKE EFFECT  --  " There are a lot of putts you think will move toward the lake , " says director of golf Steve Friedlander . " They do n't . " SHORT AND SMART  --  Most players will lay-up here . " If the wind is blowing , " says Micheel , " no one will reach this green in two . " DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD  --  THE GOOD NEWS : A tee shot long up the left side means the green is reachable in two . THE BAD NEWS : It also means a longer uphill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DEAD  --  Players who lose it left of the fairway will find knee-high fescue and a sidehill lie . Unless ... WAY LEFT IS WAY DEAD  --  ... they hit it even farther left into the deep bunkers and longer grass . Even Stewart Cink wo n't get a good lie here . SHIFTING SANDS  --  " You 're not going to have a level stance , " says Friedlander . " Your ball might be in a good lie but your feet wo n't be . " 17TH HOLE " PINCHED NERVE , " 223 YARDS , PAR 3 Literally a cliffhanger , this par 3 is every bit as daunting as Dye 's island-green 17th at the TPC at Sawgrass . CBS announcer Lanny Wadkins might just tell players it 's OK to make a bogey at this point in time . FEAR FACTOR  --  Players who find these bunkers are looking at an explosion shot toward an even worse bunker and the lake beyond . LINE DRIVE  --  The large dune bunker short right of the green scares players into going left but the smart line is almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of this green has pulled it , " says Friedlander . BUNKER HELL  --  Lake Michigan should n't be in play , but these bunkers are . Friedlander says players are better off wet : " At least you get to reload . " The bunkers are 25 feet below the green ; the flag-stick is invisible . From here players will need to hit something that gets real high , real quick . 18TH HOLE " DYEABOLICAL , " 490 YARDS/500 YARDS , PAR 4 There 'll be two tees used at No. 18 , considered by some to be the weakest hole on the course . After the earlier lakeside drama , the year 's final major finishes inland , behind the clubhouse . BUSH WHACKED  --  " Pete must have a Machiavellian streak , " former President George H.W. Bush said as he walked off the green here . " He likes to punish people . " PERFECT MISS  --  Where is a safe place for a leader to miss come Sunday afternoon ? " Middle of the green , " says Friedlander . " Short left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Long is no good either  --  there 's a bunker back there . " LAY-UP PUTT  --  The putting surface is cross-shaped . If the flag is on either arm and the ball is on the front of the green , the first putt is a lay-up  --  or a lob wedge . BOMBERS BEWARE  --  " If there 's a 30 mile an hour wind behind , there 's probably a guy who 'll be foolhardy enough to try to reach the lower fairway , " says Friedlander . That hardy soul will need to fly the ball 370 yards . DROP OFF  --  From the end of the upper fairway it 's 170 yards to the green . The green is an amphitheater and the wind swirls . Even if the wind is at your back on the tee , it feels in your face on the approach . UPSTAIRS  --  A.K.A. the forward tee : From here it 's a mere 490 yards . DOWNSTAIRS  --  From here it 's 500 yards and a 280-yard blind uphill carry to clear the bunkers on an aggressive line . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Tour pro Blaine McCallister .
