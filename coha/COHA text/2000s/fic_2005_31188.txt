Chapter One : Doris Mindfuck The ladies ' room door squeaks open and I stop breathing , jerking my feet up on the toilet seat lid in an effort to work through my lunch hour in solitude . Rubber soles scuff along the honeycomb tiles as I bend to inch the remains of my lunch out of view , but my pen betrays me , rolling brazenly out of my lap and onto the warped floor . " Who 's in here ? " my boss , Doris , shouts over the din of sweatshop sewing machines whirring up the air shaft . I consider not responding  --  maybe she 'll think the pipes are now leaking not only asbestos but pens . " Hello-o ? " She knocks once on the last stall door before rattling it forcefully . Her tightly permed gray curls appear below me . " Oh , Girl , it 's you . " I will a cheery smile . " You have your period again , do n't you ? " She stares up disdainfully as she turns a deep red from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  she takes in my research materials on the floor  --  " I 've provided you with a perfectly good desk . " " Yes , thank you ... " I try to dislodge my crossed legs without stepping on her face . " I was just taking advantage of the quiet to finish my presentation for the conference . " I unlatch the door , and she abruptly shoves it in toward me , spraying the cup of coffee I 'd balanced on the toilet-paper dispenser onto my coat . My new coat . She arches her eyebrows over her multicolored Fimo clay bifocals . " You 're a mess , " she pronounces . " You really should make your lunch at home and bring it with you . You 're not managing your finances very well if you buy those expensive sandwiches every day . But I guess that 'd mean you 'd actually have to get out of bed on time . " She remains squarely in the stall doorway , indicating that I owe her an explanation . " I should , " I say with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my files , from the floor . She folds her arms across her ample chest and continues to stare me down . Before I can determine how to atone , the bathroom door squeaks open again , and Pam , deputy director of the Center for Equity in Community , waddles in . " Oh , Doris , there you are . " She approaches , hulking from side to side like a bloated John Wayne . " I 'm heading uptown for that meeting on the Youth Center rally , and if it 's anything like last week 's , I 'm going to be there till dinner  --  " " Those . Are . Fantastic . " Doris thrusts her pointer finger at Pam 's purple clogs , which match her bright purple hemp jumper and the dark purple African lariat she has ambitiously combined with lilac Mardi Gras beads . Had an eggplant been available in her kitchen , she 'd have donned it as a hat . " Well , I saw Odetta 's green ones , so I asked for a pair from Santa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pam gestures to Doris 's black Nubuck booties . " I 'll never tell , " Doris says coyly , turning her ankle . Doris 's hemp and Nubuck ensembles are famously all-black , giving her a cosmopolitan air amidst the Center 's menopausal sea of the **27;770;TOOLONG adverse . " I 'm just going to  --  " I point to the sink by the door and shimmy past them , dabbing at the pending stain on my coat with a sheet of toilet tissue . " Look at this one . " Doris grudgingly steps aside and jerks her thumb at me , letting Pam in on the latest Girl Headache . " Ca n't keep her coffee in its cup . " She purses her lips , narrowing her eyes before continuing , " Girl , meet me in my office after you pull yourself together . I want to make an addition to the conference packet . " " Definitely . And I want to go over my presentation  --  " But their pear-shaped figures are already disappearing as the door stutters closed . I slap my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last paper towel from the cracked dispenser , and shrug off my assaulted coat . I do make it out of bed on time , thank you very much . And actually , since you ask , I 'm working through my unpaid lunch hour . For you . And the fact that the only square inch of peace and quiet I can find in this swirling tornado of psychodrama is on a toilet seat should tell you something about the kind of outfit you 're running here . I 'm not the jackass . You . You are the jackass . " Jackass , " I level at the curling thirty-year-old poster for Having Our Say : Teaching Young Women to Step Up and Speak Out ! , Doris Weintruck 's iconic tome and the misleading cornerstone of my Wesleyan curriculum . She manages a dimpled grin , tilted with insouciance , to her raised smocked shoulder , her auburn curls teased into an empowering Linda Carter do . Gripping the lapel where the coffee stain is now indelibly entwined with the pink wool , I whisper my pronouncement to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I turn to the door , heart rate escalating , mouth sandy . Just do it . Just march right in . Just march in and take a seat  --  no , stand . Yes , march right in there and stand and ... and tell her that she 's unprofessional ... and a hypocrite and , and ... and mean . Or wait till five when she 's tuckered . Or Monday when she 's rested . Maybe do n't do it in person at all : Hello , you . This is me . I 'm not coming back . Hang up and that 'd be it . Over . Done . No bloodshed . No bloodshed but no closure . I spin to the poster and search her flat eyes . Do n't I owe Doris Weintruck , founding mother of the Female Voice Movement , the opportunity to throw her arms around me and wish me the best , so that we can move on , not just as colleagues but as friends ? So , ten years from now , when we 're co-chairing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how I look like a rocket scientist , sound like a rocket scientist , and am , in fact , a rocket scientist , we can have a nice long giggle about how she used to treat me like an asshole ? I avert my gaze to the counter , where , inside my purse , my checkbook is barely covering the essential trinity of food , shelter , and student loans . Fuck . Fuckfuckfuck . I sigh , once again tabling the fantasy . Folding my coat over my arm , I pick up my paper , " Beyond Renouncing : Modeling Practical Strategies for Young Feminists , " that I 've been researching , on my own time , since Doris finally consented to let me deliver my first talk at her annual Having Our Say Conference . An event charged with activists at the forefront of the field , whose siren song brought me to the Center in the first place : If women could just unite on , we could change . And it 's this opportunity to join the conversation that 's the last anemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds me literally up to my eyeballs in stacks of pastel photocopies . Mindlessly collating packets while the radiator cackles and clanks , I circle the table , lost deep within a vision in which I 'm stepping down from the conference podium amidst warm waves of applause as Doris turns to me , her head bowed low in respect . " NOW wants you on their think tank , and Hillary would like to take a meeting , " she announces , reaching to shake my hand . " I 'm hiring an assistant for both of us . " " Girl ! GIRRRRRLLLLLLL ! " Doris screams me back to reality from her office down the hall . " GIRRRRLLLL ! " She fills the door frame of the overheated janitorial closet , retitled the Speak-Out Room . " What did you do with that number ? ! " " Sorry , which number ? " I bookmark the pile I 'm collating from with my hand . " That number ... for the woman ... with that program  --  you know ! " Doris takes it upon herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which I logically would have hidden beneath three thousand sheets of paper . I dive to save the lilac from toppling into the powder blue , but it 's too late . " Come on , come look by your desk . I know you kept it . " I swipe my coat before she jerks me down the long row of cubicles and back to the hot-flash-provoked arctic sector of the office . " I 'm sure we 'll find it , " I say , my breath hovering in little frosted cloud bursts as Doris stretches out my sleeve . " If you could just tell me which program she was  --  " " Well , if I remembered that , then I would n't have to disturb you from your origami . I gave it to you this morning . Here , look around your area . " She points at the child-sized school desk that 's been allotted for my full and luxurious use . The very same desk on which I 've had to store six hundred copies of fifty-three handouts because Odetta , the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all their junk " in the Speak-Out Room overnight . Reaching for the binder in which I 've learned to keep a detailed log of every single phone message , I flip to today 's date and run my finger down the list . " Um , are you sure it was this morning ? " I gingerly detach Doris 's clam-grip from my now distended , coffee-stained coat . " Because I do n't  --  " " That 's what I said , is n't it ? " She drops to her knees and shoves herself between my legs to root through the garbage can . " If you would just keep things a little more orderly out here , Girl . " " Right . It 's just that with all these conference materials  --  maybe it might be more efficient if , maybe , we could store them in the clos  --  Speak-Out Room . And I 'm glad you grabbed me because I 'm really eager to get your feedback on my presentation . " I flip through yesterday 's phone log . " Do you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knocking over the full can . " Yes ! Yes , that 's her . See , I-told-you , " she singsongs . " Um , she actually called yesterday and I left the message right ... " I walk into her office . " Here . " I pull the Post-it off her computer screen and hand it to her as she shuffles in after me . " Humph . " Doris takes it with a slight blush . " Super ! So , have you had a chance to review my presentation ? " " Girl , " she says sternly , " that 's a premature conversation . I feel there 's another issue you need to address first . " She points with her nose to the sagging chair across from her , and my stomach sinks . " Go ahead , have a seat , " she instructs firmly . I detest this office ; it has no windows and is covered with crumbling collages made by Doris 's Step Up and Speak Out ! adolescents of yore . I always end up eye level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat from a Summer 's Eve douche box circa 1979 pasted beside yellowed advertising copy that proclaims , Sisters are doing it for themselves ! But even that is less cringe-inducing than the framed Ms. cover of Doris bleating into a megaphone . " Girl , " she says , " I want to share with you that I 'm really quite troubled by something that I think would be a disservice not to bring to your attention . " " Oh ? " " You seem to be abnormally preoccupied with space . " " Sorry ? " " Space . Having it . Needing it . Wanting it . You talk about it all the time . I 've told you on several occasions that we 're operating with a commune perception here at the Center . I believe we 've discussed , ad nauseam , that you need to make peace with your allotted area . " " Right . I 'm , um , fine with my desk . It 's just that these conference packets had only ten handouts for two hundred participants a week and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot more paper now , so  --  " " See , Girl , I think it 's pretty unhealthy that you choose to deflect responsibility for your own inadequacies right back onto me . " " Sorry ? " Doris leans in and places her hands on my knees . The Summer 's Eve woman does a slow hula behind her as I lose air . " I want you to work on this . Maybe work on it in your own life . This is a sign of further  --  deeper  --  issues , I feel , for you . It 's really why I do n't like working with you young twenty-somethings  --  you 're all just so ... " She tilts her face to stare intensely at me over her bifocals . Instinctively I mirror her , leaning forward . We slowly continue to move in toward each other while I await my sentence . " Needy , " she finally pronounces before nearly planting her face in my lap . She reaches around me to retrieve a stack of crumbling leaflets , momentarily suffocating me with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm thinking fuchsia , lime green , and orange . " I stand up . " Wait , Girl  --  not the light orange . I want the bright one . " " Okay . Sure ! " " No , no , maybe the pale orange is better . Make copies of both and bring them in for me to decide . " I glance down at the first thirty-year-old leaflet . " This one might be too old to Xerox . It 's almost illegible  --  " " Yes ? And ? " Doris smiles at my idiocy . " So , you 'll need to retype it . Come on , Girl . " I check the rusted school clock above her shoulder . " I think I mentioned this yesterday , but all these materials have to be in the mail by Monday . It 's just that the copy machine has been kind of temperamental . So if , maybe , we could , you know , not add too many more  --  because so far I 've only been able to make fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Six hundred and thirty-four ! I just got a group from Des Moines ! " Doris claps her hands like an excited child . I dig my fingernails into my palms and do n't roll my eyes . " So the six hundred and thirty-four packets  --  " " Well , Girl , the point is the content . We are n't going to tailor a national conference around your social life now , are we ? I 'm not going to call the funders in Washington and tell them we ca n't do it just because you ca n't put a few more papers into a folder or two . " OR SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY-FOUR ! Doris smiles coyly . " I think you had best plan to be here over the weekend if you 're managing your time that poorly . " The phone rings and I wait to remind her again about my presentation . Smiling out into space , she lifts the receiver to her ear . " This is Doris ! " she chimes . " Hello , Jean . Before I answer your questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , uh-huh . Well , I appreciate your challenge , Jean , I do , but if you set this as a goal for yourself  --  engaging with your editor is a growth opportunity for you . Reframe for him that this year 's conference is going to be an unprecedented gathering ... Oh , now , do n't take me the wrong way , I 'm only saying that when we silence ourselves , Jean , we suffer . And I know you know this . As I was saying , an unprecedented gathering of the preeminent thinkers in the field of teenage-oriented public policy and community outreach ... I may have said that last year , I ca n't recall ... No , I do n't think my ' brand ' of feminism is outdated .... Well , of course I 'm participating . Why would you even ask that ? ... A different angle ? What kind of angle ? ... Where are they now ? ! I 'm right here ! ... You 're questioning my relevance ? That 's an idiotic paradigm and a right-wing distraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doris drops the phone and turns to me , her dimpled hands splaying across her hemp-swaddled belly . " Silenced , Girl . We 're being silenced . " She glazes over as she fingers her trade beads . " All my hard work getting this summit funded for the back page . " " Maybe this is n't really suited to The Times . Why do n't we reach out to Mother Jones , The Atlantic ? Or if you want local coverage , I can call The Voice  --  " " Light orange . Definitely . " She waves me brusquely from the room . " I 've brought you re-in-force-ments ! " Doris singsongs the next morning from the hallway outside the Speak-Out Room , where I 'm surrounded by piles of copies and boxes . She sashays in wearing her black corduroy culotte and vest , looking every bit the Peace Corps elf . " Great ! " I reach for enthusiasm , praying she 's pulled in a few of the other beleaguered , yet able-bodied assistants . " Yes , our very own office manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wheezing , Odetta squeezes in around the far side of the table to join me , her polyester pants still stuffed into the tops of her snow boots . " She 's not leaving her stuff in here overnight , is she ? " she inquires suspiciously , as she heaves her girth up onto a stool . " I ca n't stomach that . " " Oh , no , " I quickly reassure her . " I have a desk , my own desk , and it 's all the space I need . I put all of this back in my area every evening . Because it 's mine , my space , and I love it . " Doris rolls her eyes at Odetta . " So what am I doing here ? " Odetta asks her as she has n't addressed me directly since I dared speak of the fax machine 's penchant for not faxing . " Start here , " Doris instructs her with complete authority , while rearranging everything I 've already arranged . " Actually , Odetta , " I finally interrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circuits of the table to fill a single folder , " maybe you could put the name stickers on . That would be super-helpful ! " " All right , boss ! " Doris salutes me , and my fingernails find their way back into my palms . Odetta then proceeds to laboriously center each sticker before applying it . " Why is this orange ? " Doris thrusts a paper at me as I squeeze past her . " That 's the color you wanted . " " Well , it 's all wrong for this topic . Orange for menstruation ? How about magenta ? Odetta , what do you think ? " " You 're the one who knows colors , Doris , " Odetta coos . " We 'll have to decide later , " Doris sighs , checking her Swatch . " Now , I have to run to a meeting in Brooklyn . I 'll be back after lunch . Be nice to Odetta , and do n't work her too hard  --  she 's doing you a favor . " She hustles out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lets me know she 's not putting up with any of my funny business . " Thank you so much for helping out with this ! " I beam , eager to boost her sticker per hour ratio . " The fax machine has been working like a dream lately . You really have a way with it . And I hear your plans for the Self-Esteem bake sale are going really well ! " I collate around her immobile frame . " I 'm so sorry I 'm going to miss it  --  I 'm presenting at the conference that day  --  " " Nope . You 're working the table from nine to noon . " Before I can correct her , Odetta 's cell rings and she pulls it from her stretched elastic waistband . " Thought you hung up on me ... Well , you should carry more change . I was saying that I just do n't feel like you 've been there for me lately . You did n't call me on Christmas . Or New Year 's . Hold on , " she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to be in Toledo , " I tell her . " I 'm presenting this year . " Odetta shakes me off . " When my sister had that Pap smear , I spent a lot of time thinking about what 's important in my life , and I have my husband , my cats , and us . You and me . I felt like I could n't count on you at all this week  --  " I tap her hulking shoulder . " Do n't touch me ! " She puts her hand over the mouthpiece . " Yes , you are working the table . Doris signed you up yesterday . " " Yesterday ? ! " No ! Nonono ! With rising panic , I accelerate my collating , squeezing quickly past her mammoth butt with each orbit of the table . Odetta shrinks from the contact as she rails on to someone presumably in prison . " When the cat 's feet are acting up , it makes my rash come back . I 've been awake every night itching and taking oatmeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you when I get to work and if you are n't there  --  I 'm not saying you do n't have things to do ... no , I 'm not saying that . I said I 'm not saying that . If you 'll listen ... I 'm saying that I had to take the cat ... " The radiator clanks aggressively , Odetta 's motionless hand leaving a sweaty smear of ink on the forgotten folder , rendering it , and her , useless . Trudging back from lunch , I unbutton my coat , prepared to do battle . My heart stops as I round the corner to find that my desk has been pillaged . " Shitshitshit . " Every single thing has been moved ; files are gone , piles have been rifled , my carefully constructed packing lists for the conference materials are nowhere to be found , and the binder with my notes on who 's available to sub for me at the bake sale is MIA . I start to see spots . " Um , " I call out in greeting as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk has been  --  " " Cleaned . Yes , it was a disaster . I do n't know how you were getting a single thing done out there . You 've been whining about help , so I took it upon myself to make some order . You 're welcome . " Doris has my binder open on her desk , which is in its usual state of disarray . " I really do n't know why you keep all these messages , Girl . It 's a little neurotic . ' Not a baking enabler . ' " She snorts and tosses the binder back to me . " What does that even mean ? " I consciously close my open jaw . " Right , I wanted to ask you . There seems to be some confusion with Odetta . She 's under the impression that I 'm working the bake sale while we 're at the conference . " Doris just looks at me . " So am I ? " " What ? " " Working ? " " Not at the moment . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes . " " But that 's the day I 'm supposed to be presenting  --  " " Your behavior has n't really indicated you 're ready to present . If you ca n't manage the assembly of a few packets ... " She shrugs , helpless against my incompetence . " Besides , you never gave me a draft of your presentation , and we leave in two days . Did you see my note ? " She reaches for the phone . " What ? Wait . I 'm sorry , I gave you a draft on Monday . I can print you up another copy now  --  " " I 'm in meetings all afternoon . The note 's on your desk . It came to me at three a.m. , while I was peeing  --  you can forget about sleeping after you turn fifty  --  and I realized just what this conference is missing . " The speaker at the other end of the phone picks up and I 'm forgotten . " He-llo ! Doris Weintruck at your service ! " I walk back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sadly violated , trying modestly to cover itself with an article ripped from Ms. Magazine about teenage apathy . I sit down to stare at the flimsy toilet-tissue note paper-clipped to it , in which only an A , S , and T are distinctly legible in the two-word message scribbled in bleeding felt tip . " Arrogant thrust ? Apologetic trust ? " Wait ... is that an m ? Carrie , another program assistant , squeezes by my desk , and I grab her arm . " Doris-speak . " I hand her the tissue . " Absolute must . " " Thanks . " Carrie fixes me a quick look of desperation and jerks her head toward Odetta 's cave . " Staple machine 's busted again . " " Open with how much you love her and that you in no way consider what you 're about to say to be her fault . " " Thanks . " We exchange a nod , and she disappears around the corner . " GIRRRRRLLLLLL . DID YOU FIND THE NOTE ? " Doris 's scream precedes her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please , wait right here . I 'm making a copy of my presentation right now  --  you could read it on the way home . Let 's schedule a meeting tomorrow to go over your feedback . " I grab her calendar . " I 'll pencil it in on the way to the copier , you stand here  --  " " Of course I can stand here , " Doris mugs for a passing director . " You do n't have to be so dramatic . " First thing the next morning , having collated into the wee hours , I lure Doris to her desk with the aid of multiple cheese Danishes so she can review my presentation . She waves me back to work with the promise of a ' little helper . ' And when he arrives , he is just that . The home-schooled offspring of Doris 's friend , this germ-riddled assistant comes to just below my thigh . It takes his five-year-old hands eleven excruciating minutes to slide a single flyer into a single folder . Which is still faster than Odetta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the toys . " " Great ! Fine ! Go play . " I wave him away to drip snot over the tower of training tools lining the walls of the Speak-Out Room . " Hey , get that down for me . " He points at the Tupperware tub of colored chalk . " What ? " I look up from where I 'm stuffing double-time . " Yeah , okay . " I pull the tub from the shelf and toss it on the floor . " Hey ! I want to play with the markers ! " Followed by , " I ca n't reach the red things . " And then , " See that yellow box ? Get it  --  " " LOOK . You 're going to have to pick one thing here , mister . And just one thing . I only have one more reach in me , because , while it may not be apparent to anyone else in a twelve-mile radius , I 'm actually working here ! " His lower lip starts to quiver and , remorseful , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be your very , very favorite one to play with ? " He sneezes into my face before pointing to something high on the shelf that I have to balance on the conference boxes to get down . I toss him the container and try to make up for lost time . " Aaahhhhh ! " His orgasmic cries of passion startle me . " I ... LUUUVV ... STYROFOAM ! ! ! I LOVE IT ! " I pivot to discover a billowing cloud of sherbet-colored peanuts rising and falling in little bursts above the collating piles . " Ooooh ! STY-RO-FOAM ! " I inch around the table to find my helper supine beneath a pile of peanuts . Bits of mucus-covered foam cling to his ears , nose , and mouth . His eyes in a drugged-out half-mast , he rolls back and forth , smearing peanuts across his chest . " Okay , you 're done . " In one move , I jerk him up and into Doris 's office . " He "  --  I deposit him in the doorway  --  " is not helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have told me that right away , Girl . How can I help you if you do n't communicate with me ? " Doris rolls her eyes at Little Helper 's mother before turning back to address him as if he 's deaf . " I bet you 're very helpful at home , are n't you ? " " I clean up the paintbrushes ! " He sneezes , spitting pastel peanuts out of his mouth like a spastic Pez dispenser while my eyes fall on his mother 's batik-covered lap . On which sits a very highlighted and underlined presentation . That . I. Wrote . " Justice , come here . We 've been over this : Styrofoam is a killer of the universe and that means a killer of you . " She pulls him to her , swinging her gray braid behind her . " Now play here while Momma finishes up her speech . " " Doris , can I speak to you for a sec in the hallway ? " It 's out before I know what 's coming next . " Excuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be spoken to . " Doris curves the ends of her mouth down and raises her eyebrows . " Here , why do n't you show Justice the pictures from our Guatemala retreat . " She hands a water-stained envelope to Momma Batik and follows me outside . " Yes ? " " That 's my presentation . That I gave to you to review . Why does she have it ? " " We 're a team and you 're sounding very accusatory . " Doris rests her shoulder against the wall . " You should take a moment to listen to your tone . " " I respect that we 're a team . But I do n't understand . The research has taken me over a year and a half . I 've spent weeks of my own time to get it written . When I interviewed with you  --  " " When I took a chance on you , I made it extremely clear that you were committing to flexibility  --  " " Right  --  " " So , listen to yourself . " She stares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have done everything that you asked me to do , and I thought we agreed  --  look , do n't you remember our conversation in August ? When the air conditioner was broken and I had to ice your forehead ? How you said my research would be invaluable to the conference participants , helping them mobilize young women for the next election  --  when choice and health care will be on the table . That my proposal was written with fresh eyes . Fresh . Eyes . Mine . That 's verbatim what you said . We agreed that I was ready to  --  " " You only hear what you want to hear . I never said  --  " " But you did ! " " Did I ? " " Remember , you said that it was a great starting point for me , and if I wrote my findings up , I could do it . " " Do what ? " " PRESENT ! " I feel as if I 'm speaking Martian . Is she deaf ? ! Am I crazy ? ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pruny face . " Look , you ! I know what I said . I said it and you said it and I 'm doing it ' cause that 's what we said I 'm going to do . So just say that I said just now what I just said and you heard . Say it , I 'm  --  " " Fired . " Continues ...
