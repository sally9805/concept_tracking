JON GOSSELIN ON HIS MARRIAGE CRISIS , HIS UNCERTAIN FUTURE AND HOW HIS KIDS ARE COPING . By the time Jon Gosselin arrives at the Manhattan offices of his newly hired media attorneys , he looks like he 's been through a war . His eyes and face are marked by fatigue , and , when not speaking , he leans back in his chair and stares blankly ahead , seemingly numb . Only when he realizes that he 's reached this room without being caught by photographers does he crack a smile . " All of them are sitting at my house and I 'm here , " he says , with some satisfaction , of the paparazzi . " I swoop in and swoop out . " Lately Jon could be forgiven for wanting to swoop out and disappear entirely . Under attack ever since he was caught leaving a bar at 2 a.m. with another woman , the 32-year-old star of the TLC reality hit Jon &; Kate Plus 8 -- which chronicles his life with wife Kate , their 8-year-old twins and 5-year-old sextuplets -- has seen his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've never spoken to them . I 've got nothing to say to them , " he says of the magazines that have delighted in his marital meltdown . " My only outlet is the show , other than this interview . " But while Kate spoke openly to PEOPLE in May about the perilous state of her marriage , confessing that " Jon is confused and struggling with a lot of different things , " Jon himself is cautious about being too candid . He recently underwent rigorous " media training " designed to help him deflect any and all questions that might be too personal . As a result , when asked about the status of his relationship with Kate , 34 , how it reached such a crisis point , and even whether or not he still loves his wife , he offers the same response : " It 's a private matter , and we 're discussing it privately . " Will he and Kate work on repairing their marriage ? " That 's a private matter , " he says pointedly . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month , Jon was willing to shoulder much of the blame for his family 's troubles . " Right now I feel a bit lost . It 's been hard to deal on many levels , " Jon told PEOPLE at the time . " The hardest part by far is what it 's done to my family . " Nearly 10 million viewers now know what it 's done : The season premiere of Jon &; Kate Plus 8 was a heartbreaking documentary of a marriage imploding . Jon and Kate not only barely spoke to one another , they hardly made eye contact . " Very swiftly we 've turned into two different people , " said a teary Kate . This week 's episodes , mostly taped in March , show Jon and Kate already leading separate lives . " This season , sometimes you 'll see Kate and I interview separately , sometimes ... together , " Jon explains on the show . " It really depends on how things are going . " How things are going , however , is still unclear . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kate told PEOPLE . " We 're so busy shielding off attacks from the outside . " But Jon is quick to point out that , while recent episodes may have shown him as surly or hostile , he 's not angry . " I 'd say it 's more that I 'm upset about certain things , " he clarifies . " I think all parents , and anyone who is married , are always going to have times when you 're upset with someone . This is a reality show , so you 're going to see real emotion . " How much of that real emotion should be offered up for public consumption is just one point of contention between the couple . Last month Jon explained that things got rough once reality stardom really set in . " We have more viewers now ; we 're doing more episodes , " he said . " The show is our life , and our life is the show , which is the hardest part . How do you separate that ? I go home and 50 people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PEOPLE that she will continue with the show because " I must go on and provide for my kids , " Jon takes exception to the idea that reality stardom is his new profession . " It 's not my job , " he insists . " My job is to take care of my kids and raise them the way that they need to be raised . That 's Kate 's job too . One of us will always be with them , regardless of what happens to me and Kate . Our focus will always be on our kids . " As for the continued paparazzi presence , Jon has resigned himself to it . " I always think , Enough is enough already , and they should just move on to somebody else , " he says . " But it has gotten to a point where it 's become a working relationship . They know the rules about not photographing on school grounds , so I 'm gon na drop my kids off at school . If they catch me , they catch me . If they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to stop my life because there 's 15 people with cameras outside . " Especially since there are several more cameras rolling inside , as the reality show has continued to document the family 's daily life despite the considerable tension between Mom and Dad . It is this fact that has led critics to blast the show as exploiting the family 's problems and , worse , their eight children . Recently the Pennsylvania department of labor announced that they were investigating to see if the show was complying with the state 's child labor laws ; TLC released a statement saying that it " fully complies with all applicable laws and regulations . " But former child star Paul Petersen , who runs the nonprofit group A Minor Consideration to monitor the treatment of child actors , is n't satisfied . " The idea that there are permanent cameras in the home -- that 's not the way to raise children , " he says . " To those who are saying , ' Well , they 're doing quite well , ' I say there are thousands if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine because Mom and Dad go to work . " But Jon noticeably bristles at any suggestion that his children are being harmed . " Exploited ? I do n't even want to use that word , because I think it 's ridiculous , " he says heatedly . " Maybe people should look that word up in the dictionary and learn what it means before they use it in headlines . We 're a family that happens to be on TV , not a TV family . We have healthy , happy , well-adjusted , educated kids . They 're bouncing around and having a good time . Kate and I have worked our hardest to raise them that way . " It is , in fact , when talking about his kids that Jon is at his happiest . When he mentions the antics of youngest child Joel ( " For some reason , this summer he just wants to wear jeans . It 's 85 outside ! " ) , it 's as if the oxygen has returned to the room . And , Jon insists , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them happy means quitting the show . " Every time a season renewal comes up , we always have a family discussion , " he explains . " Our kids are 80 percent of our family , and if they do n't want to film , we 're not filming . It does n't matter if we want it or production wants it . If they do n't want it , we 're done . " But with the show continuing -- at least for this season -- Jon admits he has yet to figure out how he will maintain some level of normality while the world is watching . " I ca n't tell you what the future is , " he says with a shrug . " How am I going to do it ? I 'm taking this day by day , hour by hour . I 'm going to do what I 've always done . I 'm going to roll with the punches . " PULLQUOTE " MY JOB IS TO TAKE CARE OF MY KIDS AND RAISE THEM THE WAY THEY NEED TO BE RAISED "  - -  JON BOX JON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bright spot in every day -- eight , to be exact . Devoted to his kids , Jon says , " I 'm just trying to do the best I can for them . " And while the children may still be unaware of the headlines about their family , Jon says they can handle whatever comes their way . " They all strive to be together , and they lean on each other , " he says . " It 's like in the movie Cheaper by the Dozen , on the first day of a new school . They 'll all link arms and say , ' We will get through this together . ' " CARA " She 's a good mix of Kate and me . She plays every sport ; she 's meticulous in her schoolwork .

Living well is supposedly the best revenge -- but looking great is n't bad , either . When Kate Gosselin took her eight kids on a beach vacation , she flaunted a bikini body that impressed some onlookers . Arriving on Bald Head Island , N.C. , on May 26 without husband Jon but with the show 's film crew in tow , Kate " looked like a movie star , " says Brittani Reynolds , a local resident . " She looked really like she takes care of herself . " In 2006 Kate was treated to a tummy tuck by the husband of a fan of the show , Dr. Larry Glassman ( now a family friend -- his wife , Lauren , and daughter Hailey were spotted out with Jon during Kate 's trip ) . Kate called the surgery " a dream come true , " but she also eats healthy -- going organic about seven years ago -- and exercises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she told PEOPLE . She hits the treadmill or elliptical trainer for about an hour and 15 minutes every day -- or until she has burned 850 calories . &nbsp;
