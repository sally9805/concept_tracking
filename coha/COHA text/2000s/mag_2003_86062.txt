Perhaps the one thing even Rush Limbaugh and Rasheed Wallace can agree on is that race was not a forgotten topic this year . // In September , Limbaugh claimed Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb received preferential media treatment because he is black  --  and a week later Limbaugh was vastly more famous . He was also out of a job . This month Wallace said that the NBA exploits its young black players  --  those $10 million contracts notwithstanding  --  and became the focus of outrage from commissioner David Stem , who called his remarks " ignorant and an insult to all NBA players . " Wallace even drew criticism from former Georgetown coach John Thompson , who told The New York Times , " Rasheed is attacking an old scar where it does n't exist . " The angry Trail Blazer 's profanity-laced diatribe echoed this one truth : White boys still am the NBA. // More telling than the reaction to Wallace 's comments was the distinct silence that followed the firing of three African-American NBA coaches  --  Doc Rivers , Bill Cartwright and Frank Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not long ago , given basketball 's racist history , Jesse Jackson might have organized a protest or at least called a press conference . But not a soul was outraged because with 11 African-American head coaches in the NBA at the start of the season , Wrings are less likely today to be seen in black or white . // So maybe 2003 was n't all that bad . On Dec. 2 , four months after we celebrated the 40th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr . ' s " I Have a Dream " oration , in which he spoke of Mississippi as " sweltering with the heat of injustice , " Mississippi State hired Sylvester Croom as the first black head foot-ball coach in the Southeastern Conference . Then last week Georgia brought in Damon Evans as the conference 's first black athletic director . Both moves could break down barriers far beyond the SEC. // In the NFL , meanwhile , longtime assistant Marvin Lewis joined the Bengals as the third active black head coach in the NFL  --  and turned the moribund franchise around . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyers Johnnie Cochran and Cyrus Mehri when the NFL issued 10 guidelines to bolster its year-old hiring policy , but the rules are strong . The policy says that at least one person of color must be interviewed as a candidate for each coaching vacancy . Each team must document every interview ( telephone interviews no longer count ) and the team 's owner must be involved in interviews of all finalists . Breaking the rules brings tough penalties , including fines and the loss of draft picks . The Lions were hit with a $200,000 fine when the team failed to interview a candidate of color before choosing Steve Mariucci. // Elsewhere in sports , the almost all white NASCAR started Drive for Diversity , an expanding program to find and feature drivers and mechanics of color . It will develop drivers , who 'll race in the Dodge Weekly Series on tracks in the Southeast , and crew members , who 'll hit pits around the U.S. in the Craftsman Truck Series . // What is clear of course is that real change never occurs in a vacuum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power concedes nothing without a demand . There can be no racial progress without pain . And if you 're a black athlete , sometimes it 's hard to see the progress . Only a few weeks ago the FBI revealed that some African-American NFL players have , for years , received letters threatening them with death if they associate with white women . " There 's racism on the team . I 've heard racist remarks in Philly , " said Eagles receiver Freddie Mitchell , a letter recipient . " It 's real . Racism is there . " // American sports reflect the best impulses of our nation and are also a faithful barometer of our worst . As with Jackie Robinson more man a half century ago , when sport overcomes its bias and injustice , it helps the broader society to do the same . In that light 2004 gives us good reason for hope .
