" Girlfriend , this is not your thing , " Lance said as he <p> passed over three napkins , then clucked his tongue . <p> " Tell me about it , " Kerri Sullivan muttered . There was liquid everywhere and a lot of it had come from a very expensive bottle of eighteen-year-old Scotch . <p> Balancing three drinks on a small tray should be easy , she told herself as she took a deep breath and carefully lifted the tray . The trick was to not think about what she was doing . Or somehow do it better , she added as the tray dipped a little . <p> This was her third lunch shift at The Grill  --  an upscale lunch and dinner place in the financial district of Seattle . The decor was simple but elegant , the food totally recognizable . The Grill was the kind of restaurant that catered to the successful executive dining with his associates or an important client . <p> She was already on probation from an unfortunate incident the previous day . It had involved crab cakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an oil-based sauce landing smack on a shantung-silk jacket . " At least I can do hair , " Kerri reminded herself as she delivered the drinks and took the men 's orders . Give her some foil and bleach and she could make anyone look like a movie star . But serving food seemed to be a challenge she could n't meet . <p> She 'd gotten the job at The Grill by lying about her experience . Her glowing letters of recommendation had been printed out on her home computer . <p> Lance , a waiter here and in on her plot from the beginning , had saved her butt three times already . If she could just hang on until Nathan King showed up to claim his usual table , she could quit before she got fired . That was why she was here  --  to confront Mr. King and convince him to help her . <p> She had her speech prepared . Even more important , she had a DVD with a copy of a program from the Discovery Health channel she planned to flash at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the front of her pants , the oddly shaped bulge hidden by her white apron . <p> For about the four hundredth time , she glanced toward the table in the corner . It had remained annoyingly empty . But this time when she looked , she saw activity . There were fresh flowers , a wine list and a bread basket . <p> She raced off to find Lance . <p> " His table 's ready , " she murmured as she pulled her tall , model-esque friend into a corner . " That means he 's here , right ? " <p> Lance sighed heavily . He was pretty enough to be on a billboard and funny enough to make her want to have dinner with him . Just for the company , of course  --  Lance was n't into women and she was n't into relationships . <p> " He 's here , " Lance confirmed . " You 're going to get fired , you know that , right ? " <p> " That 's okay . So we have a plan . I 'll take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 'll talk , he 'll be charming and agree and all will be well . If it goes badly  --  " She glanced upward and offered a brief prayer that it not go badlyit could n't . There were no other plans after this one . <p> She sucked in a breath . " If it goes badly , you come running over and yell at me to get away from your table . Then you complain loudly to the manager that I presumed to take over your station . I 'll slip out during the confusion . " <p> " With the DVD player . " <p> " Right . " Because she had to return that puppy later . It was expensive and she was , as always , short on money . <p> " This is n't going to work , " Lance told her . <p> " It has to work . I 'll make it work . " She would , too . By sheer force of will , she could move mountains . <p> She glanced back at the table and saw four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could easily pick out Nathan King . Tall , dark and rich , she thought grimly . A nice combination that made him extremely popular with women of all ages . If only her motives were that simple . <p> She waited until the men had settled down and were chatting before approaching . Random facts flashed through her mind . Nathan King , age thirty-eight . He 'd come from a working-class family and had earned his money the hard way . He was divorced . He had a reputation for being so cold , he froze out the competition . <p> He 'd also lost his son to Gilliar 's Disease six years ago . Of all the billionaires in all the world , she 'd chosen him specifically for that reason . <p> " Gentlemen , " she said when she reached the table , giving her best smile and flipping her long , layered blond hair . Normally , she wore it pulled back . But for these purposes , she 'd curled , teased and sprayed it until she looked just trashy enough to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bra doing its best with what she had , she hoped to get Nathan 's attention long enough to make him listen . <p> " What can I get for you ? " <p> Two of the men exchanged glances , then looked back at her . <p> She knew exactly what they were thinking and silently told them , no , she was n't on the menu . She was n't here for them . <p> She looked directly at Nathan King and was instantly chilled by the lack of emotion in his dark eyes . Somewhere she 'd read that he 'd been described as the kind of man who made sharks nervous . She got the analogy as a shiver tiptoed down her spine . <p> He was as good-looking as his pictures had promised . Maybe more so , but none of that mattered when the man in question appeared to be lacking a soul . <p> She had the sudden realization that she could totally blow this , and that if she failed , she had nowhere else to go . Then she remembered why she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders . <p> " Scotch for me , " Nathan said , his voice low and clipped . <p> She thought of the small amount in the bottom of the bottle she 'd knocked over earlier and hoped there was more inventory . She carefully wrote down the order , along with those from the other three men . <p> " We have several specials , " she said as she tucked her pad into her apron , reached behind it and pulled out the small DVD player . She opened it , turned it on and set it in front of Nathan . <p> " If I may ? " she asked as she pushed Play . <p> " This is new , " he said , looking at his associates . <p> " The things restaurants will do to keep business . " <p> The other men tried to look at the screen , but Kerri ignored them . The only one who mattered was the one frowning as on the DVD the interviewer questioned Dr. Abram Wallace . <p> " So you were close to a breakthrough ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " One ca n't be sure . In matters of research there are always questions . But with a little more time " <p> Nathan glared at her . His eyes were ice , his expression hard . She had the distinct feeling that if he 'd had a gun on him , he would have shot her and never blinked . <p> " What the hell are you up to ? " he asked . <p> " Saving a boy 's life , " she said , speaking quickly . Time was not her friend at the moment . " My name is Kerri Sullivan and my son has Gilliar 's Disease . Your son had it , as well , so you know what he 's going through . Cody will die soon if something is n't done . I 've been talking to scientists and doctors for years . But there are n't enough sick kids to warrant funding from the government or other private agencies . Then I saw this interview . Dr. Wallace was working on a cure for Gilliar 's Disease . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lab a few years ago . The lab shut down . He 's still working , but it 's just him and his assistant . If he had more money , he could find the cure . That 's why I 'm here , Mr. King . He needs fifteen million dollars . " <p> Nathan King motioned for the manager . Kerri kept talking . <p> " It 's a fortune I 'll never have , " she said , speaking even faster now . " But you give that amount to charity every year . If you could just give him the money , he could keep on working . He could make a difference . <p> He could save my son . Please , Mr. King . I 'm running out of options and Cody is running out of time . I know you understand . You lost your son . Please help me save mine . " <p> " What are you doing ? " the manager asked as he approached . He reached for Kerri 's arm . " This is n't your station . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Kerri pulled free and ignored her soon-to-be-ex boss . " You have to help . I 'm desperate . There is n't anyone else . I 've been everywhere , talked to everyone . Your little boy would have wanted you to help me . " <p> Nathan King had remained impassive through her speech , but now he carefully put his napkin on the table and stood . <p> He was a whole lot taller , so he bent over until they were eye-to-eye and his face was only inches from hers . " Get the hell out of here , " he growled . " Get out now , or I 'll have you arrested . " <p> " No ! " Her voice rose as she was grabbed from behind . " I wo n't give up.You have to do this . That kind of money is nothing to you . Why wo n't you save a child ? He 's just a little boy . He does n't deserve to die . " <p> Kerri fought against the men dragging her out , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front door and actually thrown onto the sidewalk . She went down on one knee and stayed there , trying to catch her breath . " You 're fired , " her boss screeched . " Fired . You 're a lousy waitress . I 'll bet your recommendations are all fake . You 're lucky I do n't have you arrested . " <p> She slowly stood and stared at the short , fat man frothing at her . <p> " I 've already been threatened with that today , " she said , suddenly exhausted . " You 'll have to try something else . " <p> " I 'm not paying you for the last three days . I 'm ripping up your time card and your application . You never existed . " <p> Kerri waited until he 'd stomped back inside before leaning against the brick building . It was spring in Seattle , which meant cool air and a constant threat of rain . She needed to drag her butt back inside to get her purse , her coat and the DVD player . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen seemed hard to imagine . <p> But it was easier to deal with logistics than face the reality of failure . <p> Nathan King had n't just said no  --  he 'd refused to listen . How was that possible ? He knew exactly what she was going through . He 'd suffered , he 'd felt the aching sense of helplessness . How could he not be compassionate ? <p> Tim , Nathan King 's chauffeur , approached . " He did n't listen ? " he asked . <p> Kerri shook her head . " You said he would n't . " Tim had actually said more than that . He 'd warned her against her plan and told her his boss liked to support his charities from a distance . He sent a check  --  he never got involved . <p> " You had to try , " Tim reminded her . <p> " I 'll try again . " <p> " How ? " <p> Good question . She 'd been so sure Nathan would help her . She 'd put all of her energy into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff , but her office skills were more pathetic than her server skills . Next she 'd attempted to become one of his maids . But while the company that took care of his many buildings had been willing to offer her a job , she 'd found out that she 'd need seniority to work anywhere close to the boss . She did n't have years to work her way up the food chain . <p> As a last resort , she 'd attempted to seduce Tim and when that had n't worked , she 'd tried to bribe him . The five hundred dollars she 'd put on the table  --  all the money she had in the world  --  had n't impressed him . Still , he 'd listened as she talked about Gilliar 's Disease and Cody and how Nathan King could be the one miracle they were waiting for . <p> Tim had offered to introduce her to his significant other  --  and Lance and the lunchtime ambush had been hatched . <p> " I 'll come up with something , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kidnap him and hold him for fifteen million in ransom . " <p> " You would n't like prison , " Tim said . " Plus , I 'd be forced to shoot you and that would be a drag for both of us . " <p> Despite everything , Kerri had to smile . Tim was about six four , two hundred and fifty pounds of muscle . He would n't have to shoot her  --  he could simply crush her like a soda can . <p> " I 'm open to any suggestions you have , " she said . <p> " Mr. King does n't like publicity he does n't control . It makes him very angry . " <p> " Okay . " Interesting , but not helpful . " And ? " Tim hesitated . She suspected he was weighing his loyalty to his boss and thinking about the afternoon he 'd spent with her son , remembering Cody did n't have as many afternoons left as other children . <p> " Sometimes it 's more helpful to ask for forgiveness than permission . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of us not flirting with a one-sixty IQ , that means ? " <p> " Say you already got what you want . Then maybe you 'll get it . " <p> Before she could absorb that , Lance burst out the front door of the restaurant . <p> <br> Continues ...
