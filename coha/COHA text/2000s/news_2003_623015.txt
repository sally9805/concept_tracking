<p> Harsh words for Ono <p> Editor  --  Too bad we do n't have Yoko Ono 's e-mail address ( " Ono waging full-page ad campaign for peace , " March 12 ) so we can respond to her sticking her opinion in our noses . Something like , " Imagine Another Terrorist Attack , " with maybe a photo of one of the poor people who chose to jump out of the World Trade Center rather than stay put and get roasted to death . <p> WILL GASTON <p> Irvine <p>  --   --   --  <p> Editor  --  Please pass the word to Ono that the vast majority of Americans consider her a nonentity and a buffoon . <p> ROLAND DUMAS <p> Clifton , N.J. <p>  --   --   --  <p> Editor  --  I 'm disappointed in The Chronicle for giving this self-serving celebrity a soapbox on which to destroy the fabric of this country . Do n't get me wrong . I 'm all for peace and love , but I wish someone would tell her that this is not Vietnam . The United States is not trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to save the world from total nuclear and chemical destruction . . . if it 's not already too late . I do n't remember her ever trying to save the Tutsis in Africa ( why did n't she speak up at the United Nations after that all went down ? ) or the senseless chemical attack on the Kurds . I guess it 's just easier to throw large amounts of money on an outdated two-word statement . How about " Imagine reality " ? <p> HANS CLEVER <p> Petaluma <p>  --   --   --  <p> Editor  --  Yoko Ono spent $42,000 telling people to " imagine " peace . What a great idea . Why do n't we just " imagine " that Saddam Hussein is a nice guy and that the 1.5 million people he is responsible for killing are alive and well ? Let 's imagine that the women he and his sons are accused of raping and torturing and killing are alive and enjoying their families . <p> Let 's imagine that he never invaded two countries for their oil , that he never gassed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Yoko Ono is definitely ahead of her time . It is much better to imagine all these things than to live in the real world . <p> I realize you are just " reporting " the news , but Yoko Ono 's message is ridiculous , and giving her free press is irresponsible . She has nothing of importance to say in the world in which we are living . <p> KEVIN KERSEY <p> New York . <p> HINTERLANDS OPERA <p> Editor  --  I am saddened by the cancellation of future tours of Western Opera Theater , the touring affiliate of the San Francisco Opera , described in an article by Joshua Kosman ( " Touring opera closes down , " March 2 ) . <p> I understand the necessity of making hard decisions like this in order to uphold fiscal responsibility . But I take exception to Opera Center Director Sheri Greenawald 's comments referring to the tour as outmoded . Traveling as a member of the Western Opera Theater Orchestra for eight years , I was thanked by many appreciative audience members in small towns across the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them had never been to an opera and had no access to productions like ours . It is simply not true that " there are very few communities that do n't have access to some kind of lyric theater . " I wish that Greenawald could have focused on the long and positive history of the organization and its contributions to communities across the nation rather than dismissing it as a " dinosaur . " <p> STACEY PELINKA <p> Principal flutist . <p> MUSIC PRIORITY <p> Editor  --  Last week , San Franciscans who appreciate German art songs could hear all three of Franz Schubert 's cycles sung in the span of five days . They were sung at Herbst Theatre by baritone Matthias Goerne . <p> Your reviewer , Joshua Kosman , dismissed Goerne 's opening recital as slow and mannered ( " Goerne slogs through Schubert songs , " March 6 ) . On Monday , when I expected to find his review of Schubert 's " Winterreise , " Kosman instead reviewed a performance by the San Francisco Symphony . <p> We can hear the San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Schubert 's song cycles in one week by one of Germany 's greatest living practitioners of art songs was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity . Yet Kosman mostly ignored it . He needs to rethink his priorities . <p> JOHN ZAUGG <p> San Francisco . <p> FLEXIBLE LINGUISTICS <p> Editor  --  As a multilingual American who has lived and traveled around the world , I have learned one thing from all countries I 've been to  --  that it 's unreasonable to expect people to pronounce foreign words according to phonetic rules unfamiliar to the speaker ( " Fightin ' words , " March 8 ) . <p> As such , if it 's acceptable for an Iraqi to refer to America as " Am-REE-ka , " why then should it be any less acceptable for an American to refer to Iraq as eye-RAK ? And more important , why not require Americans to understand why Iraq is spelled with a Q and not a K ? While we 're at it , why not expect Americans to perfectly pronounce that guttural Q ? Heck , we might as well demand that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as learning to pronounce the " strangled ah " sound that takes even the most avid foreign language learner years to master . Let 's also not forget that  --  in order to show " care " and " familiarity "  --  Americans should be forced to remember that stress in Arabic words falls on the first consonant if all vowels in the word are short , otherwise it falls on the long vowel farthest from the end of the word . <p> And , as not to be unfair , Arabs should be required to return the favor by terminating their mispronunciations of English v 's as f 's , and p 's as b 's and ch 's as sh 's . Not to mention correcting their seeming inability to spell or properly pronounce the plethora of vowels in the English language . <p> I imagine you can see where I 'm going with all this  --  that it 's unreasonable to expect foreign words imported into a language to retain their original pronunciation or stress , be it Arabic into English or English into Arabic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or uncaring about the world and everything to do with the fact that when they import foreign words into English they will make them conform to the linguistic hard wiring already in their heads . The Arabs do this to imported words , as well as the Japanese , Germans , French ( who have banned many of those words ! ) , and I would dare suggest that the rest of the world 's masses are equally guilty of this apparently egregious crime . <p> Instead of worrying about incorrectly stressed syllables of imported words by the media or the president , I think the linguistic community should just take a chill pill and be grateful that our civilizations are swapping words and knowledge at all . <p> As far as SAH-dam Hussein is concerned , he deserves every mispronunciation he gets ! <p> DANIEL SCHERECK <p> Riyadh , Saudi Arabia <p>  --   --   --  <p> Editor  --  I truly enjoyed reading James Sullivan 's article on the pronunciation of foreign names and their meanings . It reminded me of my aunt 's graduate thesis , which she wrote to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was 30 years ago , and it tackled how culture carries the " contextual orientation " of a language . <p> Being Filipina , she explained how English words can have a different meaning when mispronounced by a Filipino . She thus concluded that it is very important that Filipinos learn the correct pronunciation of English words . <p> So I would have to agree with linguist Geoffrey Nunberg that " making an effort to speak like a native is the diplomatic approach , " that suggests caring about and being familiar with a culture . It is also important that the media arrive at uniformity in pronouncing and spelling foreign names to avoid confusion . <p> CLAIRE S. MOGOL <p> Manila , Philippines . <p> BRAVO , MEL BROOKS <p> Editor  --  The review of " The Producers " did include insightful details of this fine debut performance here in San Francisco ( " Shticky business , " March 7 ) . However , I have one question . At the end of the performance , was the Little Man the only person sitting on his seat politely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the audience , standing , loudly cheering and wildly clapping approval for this wonderful , wonderful evening of entertainment ? If it was n't the latter , then shame on you , Little Man . Bravo , Mel Brooks , bravo ! <p> DENNIS O'BAYLEY <p> San Leandro <p> The Little Man was clapping politely .. <p> CAPTIVE AUDIENCE <p> Editor  --  Adair Lara 's asking some of the Bay Area 's current crop of hip and cool writers for their reading suggestions ( " Armed with literature , " March 12 ) makes me think that this group has lost something of its historical memory . <p> We 're the Bay Area , folks , famously on the forefront of the culture wars , the ones who gave the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and whatever 's left of the loyal opposition ! We 're the ones reading Jon Carroll 's column and saying , " Well , at least one media representative has n't swallowed the Kool-Aid . " <p> So here are a few more suggestions for the captive reading audience in the Persian Gulf : Why not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " into the duffel bag ? Or how about Doris Lessing 's classic , " The Golden Notebook , " which details the effects of living with the threat of nuclear war and annihilation upon the psyche of a middle-class British woman ? <p> Reprint Rudyard Kipling 's poem " The White Man 's Burden " and let those soldiers know we are continuing in a grand tradition . In fact , also give them Graham Greene 's spy classic , " Our Man in Havana . " <p> And if you , like I , ca n't quite picture soldiers on the battlefront reading George Orwell or Joseph Conrad , then at the very least remind your readers here at home that there is a choice we can all make : to feel hopeless , overwhelmed and depressed at the direction our government is taking us , or find inspiration , comfort , fascinating insights and new ideas from the giant thinkers who came before us . <p> BARBARA TANNENBAUM <p> San Rafael
