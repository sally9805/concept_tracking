A young woman in a red dress on a bare stage with bare feet . As the lights come up , the stands , looking at her feet . A moment . She looks up and sees the audience . CLAIRE Oh . You 're looking at me . I 'm going to do my dance for you now . ( She does . And very nicely too . She obviously has had training . As she dances , she speaks . ) You 've probably noticed I 'm naked . Some of you are imagining me with clothes on . Whatever . We can do what we want here . Till we run out . ( She dances for a moment in silence . Then , still dancing , speaks again . ) As you see It 's flat all the way to the horizon . And empty . No Danish furniture or geologic formations . No flics . No sex . No shopping . Those who dance , dance separately . We have only what we can do and what we know . Which is pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She finishes . ) That 's the end of my dance . ( Silence . ) Now I just stand here . ( She does . ) I do n't I know any poetry . My singing was the despair of the Midwest . I play field hockey . But there 's no equipment . I do n't do imitations . ( Silence . ) Thank God you 're just other people who do n't know what to do . And not an audience . Imagine having to watch me for eternity . And vice versa . ( A pause . ) Even at these prices . Especially naked . Now , there 's something that gets old . If I had known I would be thrown back on my own resources , I would have become a more interesting person . Learned an instrument . As it is , I think I 'll lie down . ( She does . ) The hardest thing is We do n't have to sleep Or eat . We can watch each other . ( She watches the audience carefully . ) Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not particularly worth watching . We all should have worked on it . ( She lies still , looking back at her feet . Then she looks up . ) I wonder what made me think I was a self ? Probably the SATs . ( Silence . ) I really ca n't tell if I 'm being punished or beatified . ( A pause. )
