For years , he spent long nights trying to sleep in abandoned cars and vacant lots . His father said they were just camping out . Chuck Bacon , his little brother Ryan and his mom and dad would carry blankets into weedy fields around Phoenix , Ariz . They would eat burgers and hot dogs , but there was no campfire under the cloudless desert sky ; the food had been microwaved at a convenience store . In the morning , the boys would scrub themselves with liquid soap in a gas-station rest room . In the evening , they would beg for handouts at traffic lights . When Chuck went to school , he felt as if his poverty was emblazoned on him like a letter on his forehead . <P> To meet him today , you 'd never guess that Chuck grew up homeless . At 19 , he is well-spoken and clean-cut , a former high school linebacker with his own car and a longtime girlfriend . Last month he graduated from Carl Hayden Community High School with a B average . This fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College , where , he says , he 'll try to " rediscover a bit of the childhood I lost . " <P> Bacon says he owes a good deal of his success to a special institution in Phoenix , the Thomas J. Pappas School . An oasis amid boarded-up buildings , in the shadows of downtown skyscrapers , it serves some 750 children in grades K through 10  --  all of them homeless . A day school , funded by both the state and private donations , it is the largest of America 's 40 " schools " for homeless children . Most of them are little more than classrooms in shelters . Pappas , named after a local philanthropist , is the only public school with a $300,000 foundation , new buildings and a politically savvy staff determined to make it a national model . <P> " If a child does n't have immunization records , transcripts and a permanent address , it 's very hard to attend a regular school , " says Sandra Dowling , who founded Pappas in 1989 and now , as superintendent of Maricopa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child may enroll without barriers , and kids do n't feel stigmatized here . " <P> Each morning at 7:45 , sleepy-eyed pupils file off yellow buses and begin a typical school day : breakfast , recess , class , lunch , more recess and more classes . Many come from nearby shelters , though Pappas ' buses can find them on a day 's notice wherever they 've landed for the night  --  whether at a flophouse or by the side of a highway . Most of the kids need remedial help , having missed months or years of school because their families moved around . <P> Pappas ' library has more than 13,000 books , and a new computer lab will open this fall . But the school has no gymnasium , no theater , no after-school clubs and no instrumental-music classes . Kids are required to attend mainstream schools if their families get settled . In practice , however , scores of children drift in and out of Pappas for years , partly because it 's such a nurturing place . A student who shows up with dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clinic on campus . And nearly every kid takes home a box of food each month along with toothpaste , shampoo , socks and underwear  --  all donated by Phoenix residents . Once a month , Pappas holds birthday parties replete with clowns , cake and a closetful of new toys from which honorees can pick a doll or racing car .
