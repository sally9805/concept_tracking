Henceforth , my mother will refer to it as the time I almost died . We 'll be sitting in the kitchen , both four and seven years from now . My dad will extend the leaves of the kitchen table to accommodate whatever college boyfriend I 've brought home for the weekend . And my mom , while spooning out three-bean salad , will turn and ask him , " Has Koren told you about the time she almost died ? " // I 'll never know how much of that assertion accounts for melodrama . // Sure enough , it feels like death . On November 9 , 1996 , I wake up between the Tide-stiff sheets of my childhood Banister Bed and one thought occurs to me : I 'm not wearing any underwear . // This is all the information I need to know that something horrendous has happened . At sixteen , I am never naked , save for ten minutes a day under the stream of a morning shower , and even then , I turn away from the bathroom mirror before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I am ashamed of the arcs of my own pale skin , particularly in the whitest part that spans between my hips . Given my tendency to thrash in my sleep and kick down sheets , I would never sleep without underwear . // My bed looks like it 's been made with me in it . There 's not a wrinkle in the comforter ; its patched pastel pattern is pulled smooth and tight , clear up to my neck . When I start to unroll my arms and legs from the folds of the sheets , I feel a sharp pain in my elbow , like I 've been sleeping on it , and I stop for a moment , trying to decide if that position is physically possible . // I decide to fold back the comforter from one corner , the way someone might diagonally halve a dinner napkin . I do it slowly . It 's like opening a hand-addressed letter with no return address ; I have a feeling I could find just about anything inside . // What I find under the covers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin , white , cotton smock , stippled with green , and it cuts off at my knees . I ca n't imagine who I borrowed it from , since my friends and I all sleep in nylon shorts and our dads ' XL T-shirts . When I feel around to the breach of cloth above my own pink ass , it dawns on me : I 'm wearing a hospital gown . // I 'm immobile in the face of my panic . I 'm stunned to the point that I do n't dare breathe or kick my feet in a way that would make even the faintest sliding sound on the starched sheets . I do n't know how many minutes I lay like this , motionless in the small sag that my body makes in the mattress , barely breathing . I ca n't get out of bed until I 've figured out what emergency landed me in this green and white gown . My room is directly above the dining room , and the littlest thump on the carpet can shake the chandelier ; I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm awake . // I feel like I 'm arriving at the scene of an accident , like my physical self has been creamed in a hit-and-run and my mental self is the first one to find it . All I can do is run through the basic first-aid checkpoints , the first of which is : Can you move ? // I pull my knees into my chest and wrap both arms around them with no problem , aside from the throbbing deep in my elbow . The back of my head is tender against the pillow , and my neck moves in a succession of arthritic-like cracks . But my joints move . I 'm not paralyzed. // There are no clues in the form of a cast or a bandage or stitches . Lying down , I ca n't even make out any discernible bruises . Later , I 'll be able to make out the purple impressions of fingers around my biceps , plus a golf ball-sized bruise on one ass cheek , a sort of yellowed half-moon around a raised , blue bump . But for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the hospital gown and a pink , plastic wristband that reads zailckas , koren. // The house is filled with the sounds of Saturday morning in motion . Bear is barking to be let in through the side door . There is the sound of coffee mugs clinking on countertops , and I detect the faint smell of bagels burning in the oven . I might even hear the far-off sound of my mother 's whirring laughter . // My room appears equal in its sameness . There are dirty socks on the floor and stacks of Seventeen on my desk . On my bureau , there are notebooks on top of snapshots , necklaces on top of notebooks , and dust over just about everything , ever since I barred my mom from my room . Fall light filters through the window blinds and casts sunny stripes across the carpet . I can see my back-to-school sweaters brushing elbows in the closet ; the price tags are still stapled to some of them , and I can make out the orange half-off stickers from Filene 's juniors ' department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night to try to find this dropped memory . // As far as Friday nights go , it was typical . I spent it with my new friend , Kat Caldwell . She is a girl I made friends with a few months ago for no real reason other than we both drink and we 're both sensitive . The first night I 'd slept over at Kat 's house , I saw that her sheets were streaked with mascara , and her Laura Ashley pillowcases retained the outline of her whole face : half-moon of foundation , faint ring of lip stain , black strokes from the flurried beating of her dripping eyelashes . She 'd opened the drawers of her bureau to show me the old liquor bottles she hid under her childhood ballet costumes , and I 'd laughed at dozens of tiny Lycra bodices , net tutus , and loose sequins that smelled of Tanqueray . // Kat came with a silver cord to more friends , like Abby and Allen , and I 'd gone with all of them , plus my childhood friend Claire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town over . // A girl whose parents were away in Vermont for a wine-tasting weekend threw the party . Her parents must have warned her not to have friends over while they were gone because she would n't let any of us inside her house to mix drinks properly , in cups . Instead , about a dozen of us - friends , and friends of friends , and neighborhood kids who 'd heard that someone 's parents were out - were in the backyard , slugging rum , tequila , and Kahl ? a straight from their bottles . At one point , when I asked the girl if I could go inside to use her bathroom , she suggested that I drop my pants behind the hedges across the street . // The whole ordeal had n't been the least bit thrilling . I 'd sat beside Kat on a splintering dock . Our bare feet dangled over the edge of the black , rippling water , where we could occasionally hear fish jump , making plopping sounds like tossed coins . The wind propelled dead leaves across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moon . // I started by taking small sips from the communal bottles . I knocked back a few sips of generic rum , which tasted strong and acidic , and bit my throat . I soothed it with candied gulps of Kahl ? a. // I also drank from a thermos filled with vodka that Claire had filched from a bottle in her parents ' liquor cabinet . It was the same gallon-wide jug of Absolut that we always stole from , and then added water to , in an effort to recover the stolen inches . After months of adding and subtracting , the vodka had reached a diluted state that rendered it tasteless . It was as cold and wet as springwater , and we drank it fast . // The last thing I remember is telling Claire about the poet Frank O'Hara , the way he 'd said that after the first glass of vodka you can accept anything about life , even your own mysteriousness . After that , my own mystery opens up . // There are only so many calamities that could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I lost my footing on the path leading up from the dock and cracked my knee in the place where it still was n't fully healed from the surgery . One would think I 'd remember that kind of fall , but perhaps the pain of it blacked me out . // For one horrible moment , it also occurs to me that Allen , who had driven , might have had too many sips of straight rum and veered the car off the road on the way home . It was only a month ago that a boy in our class got drunk and drove his car into a lake , where it sunk like an old tire , and he had to unroll the window to swim out . For a moment , I think whiplash could be responsible for my lumped head and stiff neck , not to mention the amnesia . But then I decide I 'd surely remember something from the moments before we crashed : gasping , blackness spreading across the windshield , the sound of pine branches scraping the flanks of the car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been with me , to see if they can fill in the gaps . But when I look for the portable phone , someone has removed it from its cradle on my bureau , as if to prevent that from happening . // I step softly to my full-length mirror , using the ballet-walk where you stand only on the balls of your feet . // The image reflected back at me makes me cup my mouth with both hands : I look like a woman in a zombie film from the 1950s . My hair looks like it 's been replaced with a Halloween wig ; it is teased into a high pile of knots and dusted with dirt and leaves , and something sticky has lacquered the ends together . From this position , I can make out a whole range of fingerprints that wrap around my forearms in shades of brownish-blue and yellow . A cat-scratch is carved into the corner of my eye ; aside from that , my face looks slack and pasty , but unmarked . // I can see now that I 'm wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with plastic beads on the soles , presumably so you wo n't slip on the linoleum floors while you 're fleeing the ward . // I add another item to the list of possible accidents : psychiatric emergency . // My alarm clock says it 's 10:30 . That tells me that whatever happened must be serious because no one has bothered to wake me for my poetry workshop . I was scheduled to spend the weekend at a conference for Worcester County 's most promising young writers , and it started more than two hours ago . The workshop is one of those college r ? sum ? padders that my mother would send me to in any state short of death . ( Just two months ago , she forced me to spend a week at diplomacy camp at Washington , D.C. , and just to spite her , I 'd skipped the lectures on youth leadership to buy forties of beer and drink them with local delinquents on the hill behind the dorm. ) // I would stay in my room all day , trying to figure out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass of water . My throat is so parched it feels raw , and each swallow is arduous . // I keep the hospital booties on because the morning has the cold nip of fall , but I trade the gown for a sweatshirt and a pair of flannel pants . I try to brush my hair , and realize with one painful stroke that the task could take all afternoon , so instead I wind the whole snarled mess into a lopsided bun . I look at myself in the mirror and wince before heading downstairs to meet my parents with the premonition that I am fucked. // It is my first blackout . // I will never again experience one so comprehensive . I get the details first from Claire , who I find pretending to sleep on the couch in the living room . My parents will rehash them with me again later , as will Kat and Allen and Abby when I see them Monday morning at school . The remaining gaps I 'll fill in years later , when I get the courage to ask my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file . // I passed out on the dock in a puddle of my own vomit . I imagine it was mostly liquor because my dad told the doctor I did n't eat dinner that night . Before that , I pulled my shirt up over my shoulders to show my bra to someone 's brother because , knowing I was slipping into oblivion , he 'd asked me what color it was . I 'd also professed a soul-shattering love for an older boy who had taken me for a drunken walk in the woods a few months earlier - a boy who had pushed my back into the cragged banks of a stream and called me a baby when I would n't let him pull off my underwear . // After I tottered and fell sideways onto the planks of the dock , nobody could wake me . Allen , Abby , Claire , and Kat carried me up the hill to the road by my arms and legs , which is why my body bears what look like forty finger-shaped bruises . They dropped me a few times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butt and the back of my head . // When they tell me this , I envision a dead body - not my body , but the body of someone in a thriller movie who has just been clubbed with a paperweight and dragged in a bloody streak across the floor by her feet . When I ask them why they did n't roll me up in a rug , no one finds it funny . // The girl whose house we were at brought out a pair of pilled sweatpants because I 'd retched all over my jeans . I ca n't imagine that she would have let me inside , given that I was liable to puke over all manner of Venetian rugs and calico curtains , so I 'll come to imagine that they pulled off my jeans outside on the porch , leaving my underwear fully exposed while they struggled to stick my feet through the sweatpants ' elasticized legs . Then they draped me across the backseat of Allen 's car and drove me to Abby 's house . // From what I can tell from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour . It was around 12:30 . Abby 's parents were asleep when my friends lugged me in through the front door . // They tried to give me a shower , to clean off the combination of liquor , vomit , dirt , and leaves that was adhered to me . I 'll never know if I was fully naked or if they left my under-things on because I am too embarrassed to ask . Nor will I know if Allen was there while they did it , though I do n't know how they could have held me under the showerhead without his strength . Afterward , they must have put me back into the sweatpants because they are there in the plastic bag that my dad carried home from the hospital , and they are all but crusted with vomit . My mom will wash them and insist that I return them , in a most undignified moment , to the girl at school on Monday morning . // By the time I was showered , I had already missed my curfew , so Abby called my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd fallen asleep while we were watching a movie and asked if I could stay the night . // My father had n't believed her . He asked to speak to her parents , and when she said they were sleeping , he asked to talk to me . I was dangling over the edge of her brother 's bunk bed , getting sick again . In a second-long flash of memory , I recall someone shaking my shoulders and telling me to pull it together for two minutes , probably so I could ask my dad if I could stay the night . When they held the receiver to my ear , I slurred , " I 'll be home in fifteen minutes , Daddy . " // Years later , he will say it was one of those pivotal moments - he sensed that the whole world swung on whether he went back to sleep or drove to me. // Claire went to the hospital with my father . She was an emergency medical trainee and knew how to calculate heart rates and breaths per minute , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is the thought of Claire answering my dad 's questions that makes me feel most guilty . //
