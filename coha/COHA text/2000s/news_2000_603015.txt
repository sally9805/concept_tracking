<p> NEW YORK  --  The trend had been building for months , but this week clinched it . Business news is now a staple of mainstream television . <p> Traditional newscasts that once dismissed business news as too geeky and non-visual for TV ran breathless reports about America Online 's agreement to buy Time Warner , devoting precious airtime to a pair of CEOs who joke that they 've each had a " charisma bypass . " <p> But that was overtaken by Thursday when , in a dizzying business-news cycle , President Clinton trekked to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange to talk to financial news channel CNBC ; Bill Gates unexpectedly gave up his CEO crown at Microsoft ; and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan delivered a speech signaling new moves on interest rates . <p> To be sure , this was an unusual week . But it illustrates the extent to which the public 's appetite for reports on the markets , the economy , corporate intrigue , and personal finance has spread from Wall Street to Main Street . <p> Maria Bartiromo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her live reports from the bustling floor of the stock exchange , says she hears it all the time . " I go to weddings and waiters come up to me and ask , ' What about those employment numbers ? ' " <p> As stock prices soar and people gaze in awe at the pace of change in technology and new media , " it seems like there 's an explosion in financial news , " says Robert Lichter , president of the Center for Media and Public Affairs . " The genre of financial journalism is n't just a beat . It 's a whole industry of its own . " <p> Lichter 's group found that the number of business stories even on mainstream ABC , CBS and NBC nightly newscasts rose 19% last year , to 1,175 from 989 in 1998 . <p> " What has so captivated us is the Internet revolution , " says Willow Bay , co-anchor of CNN 's Moneyline . " It 's transforming our everyday life . And investors do n't want to miss out . " <p> Some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stories on the general economy , including fiscal policy , labor , consumer news and poverty . <p> " The rule of thumb 10 years ago was that for every minute about the wealthy you get a minute for the poor , " says Andrew Tyndall , whose newsletter , The Tyndall Report , looks at how the major TV newscasts allocate their time . " Now the ratio is about 8-to-1 . It 's astonishing . " <p> It 's also surprising , because newscasters have long assumed that viewers flee when the subject turns to business . <p> No more . In the last three months of 1999 , for the first time ever , financial news cable channel CNBC attracted more viewers than general news champ CNN did on weekdays between 5:00 AM and 7:30 PM . <p> The trend has n't been lost on CNN . Last fall it boosted weekday business news programs to 5 hours a day from 2 . <p> But some news executives wonder how long it will last . Does the growing attention to business news represent a fundamental shift in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will fade once Wall Street 's go-go years have gone ? <p> " If the stock market did n't go up , then what 's the story ? Why would you care ? " says Michael Bloomberg , who founded the Bloomberg financial news empire . " The conventional wisdom is that the potential audience for business news is every man , woman and child  --  and that 's unfortunately not realistic . " <p> ' A permanent sea change ' <p> Yet CBS MarketWatch CEO Larry Kramer says viewers feel increasingly connected to Wall Street  --  not just because it 's booming  --  and are enthralled by the unpredictable daily flow . <p> " There 's a permanent sea change here , " he says . " Financial news is becoming an interesting story to the mass market for the traditional reasons : fear and greed . People say , ' I 've got to make all of these choices , and I do n't want to be an idiot . ' " <p> Lots of companies have big stakes in this debate . Business reports are commonplace across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fox News Channel and USA Network . <p> On the broadcast side , CBS bought a controlling stake in MarketWatch.com and uses its correspondents to provide reports for network newscasts  --  including daily spots on its new morning program The Early Show and soon local reports for network-owned stations . <p> PBS also devotes lots of time to business , from its venerable Nightly Business Report and Wall <p> reet Week to pledge drive specials featuring financial adviser Suze Orman . <p> To keep things in perspective , business news is still primarily for niche audiences . On Monday , when CNBC 's Business Center attracted its biggest audience ever , it still just amounted to 570,000 homes  --  which is terrific for cable , but pales next to the audiences that the national broadcast networks attract . This is true even allowing for CNBC 's claim that its actual audience is at least 40% bigger because Nielsen does n't include viewers watching from their office TVs . <p> Still , business news is in vogue across the board on newscasts at a time when there 's little news competition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ galvanizing citizens . Unlike last year , there 's no White House sex scandal . And this year 's presidential election has n't yet generated widespread excitement . <p> " Politics , which used to be the other big source of news , is less interesting now , " says Barbara Cochran , president of the Radio and Television News Directors Association . " If you 're in a time of peace and prosperity , people are n't looking to government to solve their problems . " <p> Business news is relatively inexpensive to produce . Most newscasts fill their airtime with talking heads in a studio . At the same time , advertisers pay top dollar to reach the well-to-do fans of financial news . <p> CNBC reaches cable 's wealthiest audience : Its viewers average nearly $ 56,000 in yearly household income . It 's little surprise , then , that the channel has one of the biggest profit margins in TV even though it ranks No. 27 for cable viewers . <p> Making the picture may look even brighter for financial news outlets , is that more Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing and families increasingly pick the retirement investments in their 401(k) plans . <p> Stocks account for about 42% of the average family 's financial assets , up from 29% in 1989 . And more than 40% of all families own stock , either directly or indirectly through mutual funds and retirement plans  --  up from about 32% a decade ago . <p> " So many more people are looking at 401(k)s and IRAs , and that growth is continuing , " says CNN Business News President Shelby Coffey . <p> These trends , plus the growth of online trading , has led to " a democratization of ( financial ) information , " CNBC President Bill Bolster says . " I 'm no longer being sold a stock by a broker . I buy a stock from a broker . That 's a distinct difference . " <p> Business news covered like sports <p> Though viewers have a financial incentive to stay abreast of business news , it 's also becoming more fun . <p> " CNBC covers it like sports with their on-air personalities , " notes CBS MarketWatch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Big Kahuna think ? ' " ( That 's analyst Joe Kernen on CNBC 's early morning Squawk Box . ) <p> The sports analogy is apt . Viewers watching live reports from the exchange floors  --  a fairly recent innovation  --  often see more jostling and body checks than in a hockey game . <p> Bartiromo says she frequently must elbow her way into crowds of traders to learn the opening prices of stocks in the news . She keeps the adrenaline pumping in her pre-market reports by trying to broadcast those crucial bits of trading information before the traders can report them back to the brokerage houses . <p> " When I first started broadcasting from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange it was new for traders to see a reporter , and a woman , " she says . <p> That has helped to make business news less intimidating for ordinary viewers . " It gives the impression that this is n't over my head  --  so maybe they can understand it too , " Bartiromo says . <p> Viewers are seeing flash as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as many movie stars , musicians and TV stars and that 's a change in the last decade , " says longtime CNN financial chief Lou Dobbs , who now runs Space.com . " Jack Welch , Ted Turner and Donald Trump are as well known to the public as the singers of 98 Degrees . " <p> Bloomberg , though , wonders whether the business news bubble is about to burst now that investors seem to be losing their passion for new Internet stocks . <p> " If there 's less of a story there , then there 's less interest ( overall ) , " he says . <p> Nor is he impressed with the growing number of online traders . " A handful of people do it , " Bloomberg says . " And my advice is to get a life and play with their kids . "
