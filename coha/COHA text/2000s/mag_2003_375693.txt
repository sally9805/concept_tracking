A rainy spring this year produced a bumper crop of mosquitoes , making for a very buggy summer . The good news : whether you are concerned about the West Nile virus or just want to enjoy the outdoors bite-free , there is a fresh crop of products out this year that promise to fight mosquitoes . There are candles , sandalwood sticks , zappers , and traps that emit carbon dioxide ( part of what attracts mosquitoes to humans ) . A Korean cell-phone maker is selling a ring tone that it claims will repel blood-thirsty bugs . The bad news is that the effectiveness of some of these new offerings is questionable . <P> The only products that have been proved to help people avoid mosquito bites are insect-repellent sprays or creams containing 35% DEET ( 10% for kids ) . But a new report from the University of Manitoba in Canada warns of dangers associated with using DEET and sunscreen at the same time . Applying them together may increase the skin 's absorption of DEET , leading to side effects ranging from skin rashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , apply either sunscreen or DEET first , then wait half an hour before applying the other . Folks who want to avoid DEET should look for soybean oil  --  based products , which according to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine are effective but for shorter periods of time . <P> To protect the whole yard from mosquitoes there are two promising options . Sandalwood Mosquito Sticks from New Mountain can repel the bugs from a patio-size area . Like giant incense sticks , the all-natural repellents smolder for three to four hours . <P> Carbon dioxide traps like the Mosquito Magnet work by emitting a plume of carbon dioxide , heat , moisture and octenol . They do a great job of capturing mosquitoes , but there 's a chance they could work too well and attract more mosquitoes than usual to your yard , some of which might bite you on their way to being trapped .  --  By Lisa McLaughlin
