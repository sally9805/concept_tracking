DEATH IN SHANGHAI // It was a bitter winter night , February 19 , 1936 , and on the outskirts of Shanghai , far from the neon and the wailing jazz , thirty-four-year-old William Harvest Harkness , Jr. , lay in a private hospital , blood-stiffened silk sutures tracking across his pale abdomen . He was dying , and alone in his agony . His original expedition mates , four adventurous men with dreams of capturing the giant panda , had all deserted him long before . Though he knew people in the city from previous trips and more recent escapades in notorious nightclubs and bars , in the end he had stayed true to some deeper nature , pushing them all away and stealing off in secret . His family , including his young wife back in Manhattan , had no idea he was even sick . With what little strength he could summon , he had been writing sunny notes home that masked his horrible condition . Perhaps he really believed his own words , for just weeks earlier he had been pressuring the doctor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , finally , on this frigid night , scarred by other attempts to scalpel tumors from his neck and torso and wretched from his latest incision , he found himself unable to eat or drink , then even to breathe . The sportsman who lived to rough it in the wild died under starched white sheets , in a ward reeking of antiseptic . His young life had ended in the pursuit of the most mysterious animal of his time , yet he had never managed to set a laced boot in the great snow-covered mountains that separated China and Tibet . // A world away , back in the noise and lights and rush of Manhattan , it had been an even chillier winter , one of the snowiest and coldest anyone could remember . Late in the afternoon , on the very day her husband took his last breath , Ruth Harkness was making her way home from a salon where she had enjoyed a luxurious shampoo . Bundled up , she happily picked her way along icy sidewalks that were dusted with ash for traction and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for cocktails shortly , and in the larger scheme of things , she had even more to look forward to . Now that things were beginning to go well for Bill , she thought , he might just be home within months . Then the two of them could travel the world as they had always imagined . // But as she stepped inside her comfortable West Side apartment , before she had time to hang up her coat , her " pretty little mulatto maid " and her houseguest , Margaret Freeland , confronted her with the horrible news : Bill was dead . A cable message had been relayed by telephone . // Her first reaction was stunned disbelief . It was too awful to accept . This must be some fantasy of the press-reporters were fascinated by Bill and the other men of high adventure , but in their hunger for sensational stories , they were always getting things wrong . It had to be one of those false bulletins . Surely , over the course of the afternoon , that would become clear . // So she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the apartment were snapped on . But hours later a telegram from Secretary of State Cordell Hull made it official . The love of her life was gone . // The devastation of that loss would consume her for weeks , and haunt her always . " Do you have that tremendous necessity of needing one person , " Ruth Harkness would ask a friend in the bruised aftermath of Bill 's death , " some person who understands you and trusts you completely in everything you do and you are-and ever can or will be ? Someone with whom you can let down all barriers ? All pretense of any kind and still be liked or loved ? ... That is what Bill meant to me and in return I gave him what he needed . " // Through their ten years together , few understood the singular nature of their bond . To the outside world , Ruth and Bill were opposites . But they were also as perfect a fit . // Both had arrived in Manhattan in their early twenties . It was the Jazz Age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Harlem for the music . People spoke openly of birth control , and women were enticed by the makers of Chesterfield cigarettes to " blow some my way . " Josephine Baker had her own nightclub in Paris . Films turned talkie . Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic . D. H. Lawrence imagined a scandalous dalliance in Lady Chatterley 's Lover , and Margaret Mead was discussing sex among young Samoans . It was the birth of Time magazine , The New Yorker , and the Milky Way bar . For young party-minded Manhattanites during Prohibition , speakeasies were all the rage . It was no surprise , then , that the worlds of two hell-raisers would eventually collide . // Handsome , short , and slender , with slicked-back straw-colored hair and light blue eyes , William Harvest Harkness , Jr. , was born to privilege . The sound of his name alone declared it . He was not a member of the famous Standard Oil Harknesses . But Bill had graduated from Harvard , class of 1924 ; he was a rich boy whose name showed up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City attorney , and the scion of a wealthy New York family , as the press described him . The Harknesses were powerfully connected and accustomed to doors being opened for them . // But those points alone certainly would not have been enough to attract Ruth . Bill Harkness also had grit , and smarts , and a wry take on the world . Never arrogant , he was nonetheless sure of himself , and unconcerned with proving anything to others . His singular nature defied easy definition . As one friend pointed out , Bill had " inherited the wiry toughness of his Scotch-Irish ancestry along with a lot of mysticism , anomalously mixed with hard-headed Yankee shrewdness. " // Both bookish and athletic , cynical and sensitive , Bill Harkness was a man of appealing contradictions . His complicatedness was something that Ruth would love . // In Ruth , Bill saw a novel act . She was nothing like the girls he had met at Harvard dances . With her black hair parted in the middle and pulled severely back , a penchant for the dramatic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for bright red lipstick , Ruth Elizabeth McCombs stood out . She was a newly minted dress designer who possessed a rare polish and poise . Speaking with a cultured lilt , she had a deep voice and a light wit . She could fill a room with her presence , her outsized personality invariably prompting people to say that she was tall , even though she stood only five feet four . She had , according to one society watcher , " that quality which Hollywood chooses to call glamour . " Over the years , her panache would carry her through lofty circles in New York City and beyond , bringing her top-notch invitations wherever she went . She appeared the ultimate city slicker but had started life as anything but . // Born on September 21 , 1900 , the third of four children , she came from hardworking , frugal stock in Titusville , Pennsylvania , with American roots going back to the eighteenth century . Her father , Robert , was a carpenter , lean , fit , and kind . Her mother , Mary Anne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit stern . A stay-at-home seamstress , she was as old-fashioned as the long skirts she wore . The McCombses lived comfortably , in a big brown two-story house that was more sturdy than fancy . It symbolized the McCombs way of life : solid and straightforward . The land , blessed by a nearby creek , dotted with fragrant apple trees , and able to accommodate a small kitchen garden , had been in the family for generations . Robert had been born on the very site where the big house now stood , in a log cabin , in 1872. // Though not poor , the McCombses were far from wealthy . And Titusville knew wealth-oil money , in fact . The nation 's first commercially productive oil well had been drilled there , propelling a few families into an elite circle . They wintered in warm places and sent their children to private school . Their mansions were huge and ornate . But in the small-town culture , rich mixed easily with poor , and Ruth gained an intimacy with affluence , forever finding herself both repelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // No matter where she went in life , she would always carry with her a number of family traits . Chief among them were resolve and stoicism . The hardscrabble McCombses were people who picked themselves up and dusted themselves off . Honesty was the number-one commandment . The family strengths were timeless , but to Ruth , it could also seem that her parents were hopelessly mired in the last century . // Chafing at the crabbed environment at home , where liquor and religion were shunned in equal measure , she found refuge in books , which took her to the far corners of the world . But even the family 's temporary move to nearby Erie could not relieve the claustrophobia that she had begun to experience in Titusville . It was a pensive Ruth McCombs who looked out from the city 's 1918 high school yearbook . Her entry , unlike the chirpy and chummy ones of her fellow students , read , " Ruth is rather hard to get acquainted with , but after you know her you find that she has many good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few people in northwest Pennsylvania really understood her , that was fine by Ruth . Like her older siblings , Jim and Helen , she planned to cut loose at the first possible opportunity . // After a semester at the University of Colorado and an experiment teaching English in Cuba , Ruth , with twenty-five dollars as her war chest , headed north to New York City . // Raven-haired and slim , Ruth Elizabeth McCombs was twenty-three years old when she first remade herself . Powdered and dressed up , she took on Manhattan , finding a job in fashion , where she could design and sew dresses for a population that bought up all the Paris knockoffs Seventh Avenue could produce . She took to her new life like a natural-utterly at ease at the center of a party , rarely seen without a smoke in one hand and a highball in the other . She became as quintessential a flapper as Clara Bow , one of the brassy , fun-loving girls in shimmering cocktail dresses who were , in the words of F. Scott Fitzgerald , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and danced with abandon . Ruth said there were only two things in the world she hated : going to bed at night and getting up in the morning . // She might have been in great demand , but it was n't because she was pretty ( she always said her face was not her fortune , and that it took an expensive photographer to bring out her best ) . She was so striking , though , that when she walked into a room , men noticed , and Bill Harkness was no exception . // It did n't matter that she came from working folks in a small town , and he from big-city upper crusters . It meant nothing that she " had to work like the devil for a bare living , " and that he maintained his comfort without a thought to employment . He was intrigued . // Together , they knew how to enjoy themselves , to kick up their heels at naughty , high-toned soir ? es and low-down speakeasies alike . During the postwar era of sexual freedom , the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as married , without the traditional , stodgy sanctity of a wedding . Neither was a prude , and both loved physical pleasure . Ruth even joked about scandalous notions like being spanked on " a bare derriere. " // At the beginning of their courtship , they found themselves constantly tucked away in some corner , slugging back bootleg booze and lost in intense conversation . Addicted to reading , they soon began swapping books on their favorite subject-exotic travel . Their leather-bound volumes were filled with high adventure and glimpses of strange cultures . Often they contained delicate fold-out maps shaded in beautiful colors , veined with blue rivers and dappled by the shadowy wrinkles of mountain ranges . The most captivating among these atlases were the half-finished ones , those in which the dense , busy portions would end abruptly , leaving blank whole uncharted territories-regions of the world still steeped in mystery . Here were the places that had not given up their secrets to Western travelers and mapmakers . Sitting together in the haze of cigarette smoke , warmed by a glass of whiskey , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those patches of the unknown . // Bill had spent most of his short adulthood " on game trails in remote corners of the globe , " Ruth said , visiting India and China , Java , Borneo , and other islands of the Dutch East Indies . He thrived on the rough-and-tumble life in the field leavened by stints of footloose merriment in exotic cities . In long letters home , and then in intimate getting-reacquainted sessions on his return , he entranced Ruth with his tales of treks abroad . // His accounts , no doubt , were as gracefully told as the sagas the couple read together . For Bill was the romantically literary type with a classical education . He had passed college-entrance examinations in Latin , Greek , French , English , and ancient history . He described himself as an author and a man of letters and was an American intellectual in the mold of Teddy Roosevelt-the brave outdoorsman , as familiar with Milton as with a " Big Medicine " .405 rifle . // He and Ruth spent weekends at his family 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romantic getaways to places like the Virgin Islands . They drank and philosophized . " A dash of absinthe , " Ruth said , " and you analyze the hell out of everything . " They read books , walked on the beach , and poured their hearts out to each other . // And there was so much to talk about . Each of them was haunted by a penetrating , persistent loneliness , suffering bouts of it even in a crowded room . Yet they craved solitude . To Bill and to Ruth , being alone was a complex state : the satisfaction of solitude played against a chronic sense of loneliness . // As they settled into a life together , and even after they were married , their rather elastic relationship was marked by intimacy and long periods of separation . Paradoxically , they seemed to grow closer while apart . When traveling , Bill found he could be utterly open with Ruth . In addressing her , he wrote more easily , and with greater clarity , than when scribbling in a private journal . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so complete , that just placing her name at the top of the page , he said , drew him out . He was so certain of a mystical connection between them that he never worried about how they would keep in touch despite the vagaries of international mail service and the fluid nature of his itineraries . " He had a divine faith , " Ruth explained , " that I 'd somehow know how to get letters to him and strangely enough I did . " // Her responses were encyclopedic . She could n't help " rambling " - telling him every detail of her activities and thoughts . // For Ruth , who would always feel that her family misunderstood her , there was , in this distant intimacy , a familiarity . She was accustomed to physical and emotional separations , and as Bill continued a life constantly on the campaign , his presence was a palpable part of her life . //
