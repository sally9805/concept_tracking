Section : Education <p> Courts throughout the United States have consistently supported the teaching ofevolution and have rejected the teaching of creationism in the science classes ofpublic schools . Although knowledge of these court decisions can help teachers resist pressures to spurn evolution or to teach creationism , many teachers have a poor understanding of the legal issues associated with the teaching ofevolution and creationism . Incorporating these court decisions into undergraduate courses , preservice training , and in-service workshops would educate and support teachers who want to teach evolution , while helping them avoid costly and embarrassing lawsuits . <p> Keywords : evolution ; teaching ; science education ; court decisions <p> On 22 July 1925 , the New York Times used its front-page headlines to tell readers that although John Scopes had been found guilty of the crime of teaching evolution in Tennessee , " the end of the trial does not end the battle on evolution " and the " evolution fight rages . " These headlines were prophetic , for the teaching of evolution remains controversial throughout the United States . Most Americans question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Moore 2002 ) ; powerful antievolution organizations such as Answers in Genesis use their multimillion-dollar budgets to undermine the teaching of evolution ( Cole 2000 ) ; and educational and political leaders in many states try to undermine science education by weakening or eliminating the treatment of evolution in the curriculum ( Moore 2002 ) . For example , although the US Supreme Court established ( with Edwards v. Aguillard ) that the teaching of creationism in science classes of public schools is unlawful , Minnesota 's recently deposed commissioner of education Cheri Yecke  --  a self-described creationist  --  wants " every local school district to have the freedom to teach creationism if that 's what they choose " ( NCSE 2003 ) . Similarly , Georgia 's Superintendent of Education Kathy Cox believes the word evolution is a " buzzword " that should be removed from Georgia 's science-education standards so that science teachers can teach " all legitimate theories , " especially " intelligent design , " to " ensure that our kids are getting a quality science education " ( MacDonald 2004 ) . And in early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who teach biblical creationism ( in Alabama ) and to require " the equal treatment of science instruction regarding evolution and intelligent design " ( in Missouri ) . Alabama 's legislation was praised by legislators " because it allows a teacher to bring forward the biblical creation story of humankind " ( Connolly 2004 ) . If the Missouri bill had passed , science teachers who refused to give equal time to " intelligent design " could have been fired ( Missouri Standard Science Act 2004 ) . The list goes on and on . <p> Teachers ' responses to the many challenges that often accompany the teaching of evolution are important and have often resulted in lawsuits . For example , lawsuits have arisen when teachers have taught or have been instructed to teach evolution ( e.g. , Wright v. Houston Independent School District ) ; when teachers have taught or have been instructed to teach creationism ( Edwards v. Aguillard , McLean v. Arkansas , Hellend v. South Bend Community School Corporation , and Webster v. New Lenox School District #122 ) ; when teachers have refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and when a variety of other situations involving the teaching of evolution have arisen ( e.g. , Ereiler v. Tangipahoa Parish Board of Education , LeVake v. Independent School District #656 , Webster v. New Lenox School District #122 , Moore 2002 , Moore and Miksch 2003 ) . In some instances lawsuits have been filed when educators followed the law , and in other instances when educators have defied the law . Some of these cases have also arisen from ignorance of the law ; as one teacher who was involved in such a lawsuit told me , " I did n't know that I was doing anything wrong . " <p> In a previous article I discussed the most common questions about legal issues associated with the teaching of evolution and creationism in public schools ( Moore and Miksch 2003 ) . For the present study , I surveyed high school biology teachers about their understanding of these issues . I wanted to answer several questions . For example , which legal issues associated with the teaching of evolution do teachers understand ? Which ones do they not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues correlated with the teaching of evolution and creationism in Minnesota 's biology classrooms ? The survey <p> Survey questions used in this study ( table 1 ) were based on a previous study that discussed the most common questions about legal issues associated with the teaching of evolution ( Moore and Miksch 2003 ) . To avoid the low return rates that have characterized several previous evolution-related surveys ( e.g. , 29 percent in Ohio ; see Zimmerman 1987 ) , I administered the anonymous survey shown in table 1 to Minnesota high school biology teachers who attended the meeting of the National Science Teachers Association in Minneapolis , Minnesota , in November 2003 and to those at the Tenth Annual Biology-Life Sciences Teachers Conference in St. Paul , Minnesota , in December 2003 . Teachers not knowing the answer to a question were instructed to leave the answer blank . A total of 103 teachers ( 84 percent of those who were given a survey ) participated in the survey . Evidence suggesting that the data reported here regarding Minnesota teachers are representative for other states is presented elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responses to the survey questions are shown in table 1 . The numbers in the table are percentages of respondents who answered each survey question correctly . At least 91 percent of respondents answered each question . All of the responses listed in table 1 are from teachers in public schools . Where appropriate , relevant text from the cited court decision is provided in a footnote . Additional information about each decision , the court making the decision , and the jurisdictions of those courts is presented elsewhere ( Moore and Miksch 2003 ) . <p> Twenty-nine percent of the teachers wrote unsolicited comments on the surveys . Approximately 20 percent of these comments were similar to this one : " This survey brought up questions that I need to get answers to . " Another 20 percent of the comments expressed frustration with evolution education ( e.g. , " It 's too bad we still have science teachers who reject evolution " ; " Parents pressure me , and it 's just not worth it to teach evolution " ) . Approximately 60 percent of the comments were pro-creationism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schedule so that I run out of time and do n't have to cover evolution " ; " I talk a lot about the holes in evolution ; students need to know this information more than that they came from monkeys " ; " I present evolution and creationism and let students make up their own minds " ; " I refuse to teach evolution , but I talk about creationism whenever I can " ; and " Why do we insist on promoting tolerance and respect for diversity and thinking for one 's self and remain intolerant of creationism ? " Discussion <p> Most high school biology teachers in Minnesota 's public schools have a good understanding of many of the legal issues associated with the teaching of evolution and creationism . For example , a large majority ( more than 75 percent ) of the teachers know the following facts : <p>  --  They are not required to give equal time to creationism if they teach evolution . <p>  --  They do not have to modify their teaching of evolution to appease students who claim that evolution offends and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government can use tax money to promote the teaching of evolution but can not use tax money to promote creationism , creationism-based books , or creationism-based exhibits . <p>  --  The First Amendment does not entitle a science teacher to teach creationism . <p>  --  A school can force a teacher to teach evolution and to stop teaching creationism . <p> These results are encouraging , for they suggest that most teachers understand the legal basis for resisting pressures to teach creationism , to ignore evolution because of students ' religious sensitivities , and to forgo field trips to state-supported museums that promote evolution . Biology teachers in Minnesota ( Kraemer 1995 ) and elsewhere ( Zimmerman 1987 , Moore 2002 ) are often pressured to avoid evolution or to teach creationism in their classes . Teachers feel these pressures ( Randak 2001 ) , and an understanding of court decisions can be a powerful ally for those who want to resist these pressures effectively . Some biology teachers have used their understanding of these court decisions to help keep creationism out of science classrooms ( Moore 2004a , 2004b ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example , surprisingly large percentages of biology teachers believe that they may give equal time to creationism if they teach evolution . If these teachers happen to be creationists ( and many biology teachers are creationists ; see Kraemer 1995 , Moore 2001,2002,2004c ) , they would presumably be more likely to teach creationism than would teachers who know that it is unlawful to teach creationism , regardless of its popularity among local citizens , students , school officials , and politicians . Indeed , all of the teachers in this survey who indicated that they include creationism in their courses also indicated the following : <p>  --  They believe that they may give equal time to creationism if they teach evolution . <p>  --  They believe that they may teach the alleged " evidence against evolution . " ( When Faribault , Minnesota , biology teacher Rodney LeVake did this , he was reassigned . He lost his subsequent lawsuit when courts ruled that he could not teach his own curriculum , and " evidence against evolution " was not in the approved curriculum of Faribault High School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they can be required by school officials to read aloud a statement that their teaching of evolution is not meant to dissuade students from accepting the biblical version of creation . <p>  --  They do not know that courts have evaluated the scientific and educational merits of creation science . <p>  --  They believe that it is still a crime to teach evolution in some parts of the United States . ( In fact , all of the laws banning the teaching of human evolution were overturned by 1970 . ) <p>  --  They have a poor understanding of the history of evolution education in the United States . ( For example , the Scopes trial did not strike down any laws , and John Scopes was convicted at his trial . ) <p> A thorough understanding of the history of evolution education can be valuable to teachers ; the basic creationist themes , and the justifications for teaching creationism and weakening the teaching of evolution , have remained largely unchanged for decades ( Moore 2002 ) . If anything , the data reported in table 1 may overestimate Minnesota @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of evolution and creationism in public schools . For example , these data were provided by teachers attending meetings of science-education organizations , and these teachers are more likely to accept evolution and its central role in biology than are nonmembers of such organizations , who are more likely to emphasize creationism in their classes ( Weld and McNew 1999 ) . <p> The misunderstandings reported in this study ( table 1 ) are consistent with other reports . In another recent study , I found that only 38 percent of high school biology courses in Minnesota emphasize evolution , whereas 20 percent emphasize creationism and 23 percent emphasize both evolution and creationism ( Moore 2004c ) . Kraemer ( 1995 ) found that 40 percent of biology teachers in Minnesota spend little or no time teaching evolution , while 15 percent include creationism in their classes . Only 28 percent of the teachers in Kraemer 's sample believe that creationism has a scientific basis ; 20 percent are pressured not to teach evolution , and only about one-third are adequately prepared to teach it . <p> Taken together , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues associated with the teaching of evolution . These misunderstandings influence science education , because teachers ' understanding of ( and personal views about ) a subject affect their teaching ( Carlesen 1991 ) . For example , although only 2 percent of Minnesota 's public school teachers believe that they must give equal time to creationism , 27 percent believe that they may give equal time to creationism ( table 1 ) . These beliefs correlate with the finding that approximately 20 percent of Minnesota 's biology teachers do emphasize creationism in their biology courses ( Kraemer 1995 , Moore 2004c ) . As Don Aguillard has noted , " Creationism is alive and well among biology teachers " ( Moore 2002 ) . Resources for addressing the problem <p> Biology teachers often encounter pressure to teach creationism or to avoid teaching evolution , or both ( Zimmerman 1987 , Kraemer 1995 , Randak 2001 ) . Teachers who want to resist these pressures are supported by a variety of resources , the most powerful of which are court decisions . Indeed , courts have consistently supported the teaching of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of public schools ( Moore 2002 ) . Teachers would presumably be more likely to teach evolution ( and not teach creationism ) if discussions of these court decisions were incorporated into more biology courses , teacher-training programs , and in-service workshops . Other resources to help teachers resist creationist pressure include position statements of professional scientific societies , state education standards , and improved training for future teachers . <p> Position statements . A variety of professional scientific societies have emphasized that students should have a thorough understanding of evolution . For example , the National Academy of Sciences ( 1999 ) urges that " only evolution should be taught in science classes because it is the only scientific explanation for why the universe is the way it is today . " Teachers pressured by creationists to teach creationism or to avoid evolution in the classroom can cite these position statements when defending their teaching of evolution . <p> State educational standards . Virtually all states have science-education standards . In many states , these standards treat evolution effectively and require teachers to emphasize evolution in their biology classrooms ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolution . However , some states have science-education standards that ignore evolution or treat evolution poorly ( Lerner 2000 , Moore 2001 ) . Moreover , the presence of high standards for teaching evolution is often unrelated to the quality of evolution-related instruction . For example , Indiana has some of the best evolution-education standards in the nation , but 43 percent of its biology teachers avoid or " briefly mention " evolution , and at least 20 percent reject or are undecided about the scientific validity of evolution ( Rutledge and Warden 2000 , Rutledge and Mitchell 2002 ) . These and similar data from a variety of other states ( Moore 2002 ) indicate that state standards for evolution are largely irrelevant to the teaching of evolution in biology classrooms of public schools . <p> Better training for future biology teachers . The teaching of evolution in high schools would presumably be improved by requiring future biology teachers to take more courses that emphasize evolution and the nature of science ( Chuang 2003 ) . For example , teachers ' acceptance of evolution and their allocation of class time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teachers who have a better understanding of evolution and the nature of science allocate more time to evolution and do a better job of teaching it ( Rutledge and Mitchell 2002 ) . However , most future teachers do not take courses that focus on evolution ( Rutledge and Warden 2000 , Rutledge and Mitchell 2002 ) . In Louisiana , for example , many of today 's high school biology teachers do n't recall hearing the word evolution in their college biology courses , apparently because many biology professors do not teach evolution ( Moore 2002 ) . Moreover , some studies have questioned whether such courses have a significant impact , because most students ' beliefs about evolution and creationism are ingrained long before their formal science education begins . This is why Sinclair and Pendarvis ( 1998 ) concluded that " students ' misconceptions remained well ingrained even after a thorough coverage of the evidences supporting evolution . " Similarly , Lawson and Worsnop ( 1992 ) concluded that " the strength of religious commitment contributes negatively toward an initial belief in evolution and to a shift toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students are more likely to express a belief in special creation and are less likely to give it up during instruction , " and instruction has almost no effect on evolution-related beliefs ( Bishop and Anderson 1990 ) . <p> Surprisingly high percentages of biology teachers teach creationism , do not teach evolution , or teach evolution poorly , sometimes because the teachers themselves are creationists . In addition , many teachers have a poor understanding of a number of legal issues associated with the teaching of evolution and creationism . The result is that " over a quarter  --  and perhaps as many as half  --  of the nation 's high school students get educations shaped by creationist influence  --  in spite of the overwhelming opposition of the nation 's scientific , educational , intellectual , and media establishments " ( Eve and Harrold 1991 ) . Biologists could help remedy this problem by placing a greater emphasis on evolution in the undergraduate and graduate curricula , by teaching students about some of the legal issues associated with the teaching of evolution and creationism ( e.g. , why we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becoming stronger advocates for teaching evolution in public schools .
