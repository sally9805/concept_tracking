Photograph // I weighed 200 pounds by the time I gave birth to my son , and afterward I stayed at 180 pounds . I had several surgeries to relieve the pain in my hands , but none was successful . I was left with 50 percent use of my right hand and my left hand was almost useless ( the motor nerves in my thumb were severed during surgery ) . The pain in my hands was constant and excruciating , even though I took medication to control it . Depressed about my disability , I spent most of my time watching television , eating and feeling sorry for myself .

I realized I did n't want to spend an hour working out , only to push my progress back by eating a high-fat meal . I started eating three meals a day and added low-fat , whole  --  grain foods to my family 's diet . A year later , I had lost 40 pounds and was pregnant with my second child . This pregnancy was more difficult and included bed rest , gestational diabetes , pre-term labor and , eventually , a Cesarean section . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had my doctor 's approval , I returned to my workouts . I did n't worry about dieting ; instead , I focused on how I felt . Eighteen months after my second pregnancy , I reached my goal of 135 pounds , which is healthy for my height and body type . Now , I 'm fitter than I ever thought possible . I can do anything : run , walk , climb and swim . I still have pain in my hands , but exercise helps control it and I 've been able to live with it . I 've learned that weight loss is n't about a size or a number on the scale , it 's about how you feel . ANN MILLER , 33 , British Columbia * Inches lost .

For the first time in my life , someone told me what I needed to do to lose weight . I talked to a good friend about what the doctor told me and she said , " Ann , this is it . We 're going to start walking . " The very next evening , she and I walked around our neighborhood . At first 1 went slowly , buffing and puffing to keep up with her , but eventually I kept up the pace . I also made changes in my diet .

This new workout stimulated my muscles and restarted my weight loss . After three months of water aerobics , I joined a local gym , where I started weight training .

Inside and out , I 'm a whole new person . // SEE YOURSELF IN SHAPE // <p>
