FRIDAY , 9:25 P.M. " This is WCWT in Sinclair , West Virginia , bringing youone of our favorite oldies , Bitter Sweet Symphony ' by theVerve . " String music soared throughout the car and RebeccaRyan rolled her eyes . " Since when does a song from 1997count as a golden oldie ? " Her Australian shepherd , Sean , sitting on the bucket seat across from her , looked backalertly . " I wonder what they call songs from the fifties ? Prehistoric ? " Rebecca drained the last bit of strong , lukewarm coffeefrom her Styrofoam cup and stuck it in the plastic trash bagalong with two other used cups . Her stomach churned , hereyes burned , and her hands trembled . Too much caffeineand too little sleep . And fear . It had coursed through hersince last night , when her cousin Molly had called her inNew Orleans and said , " Aunt Esther has cancer . " " Well , that 's not possible , " Rebecca had said inanely , thinking of the woman who 'd radiated health and energysince Rebecca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Esther had just told the family shewould have surgery and begin radiation therapy in less thantwo weeks . Esther wanted no sympathy and she wanted noone except immediate family to know of her condition . " She told me not to tell you in particular , " Molly had saidlate last night on the phone after waiting until her seven-year-oldson Todd had gone to sleep because she didn'twant him to get upset . " Esther does n't want you comingall the way from New Orleans , especially because Sinclairhas such bad memories foryou . So you have to think upan excuse for this trip . " An excuse ? Rebecca was still working on that one , hermind having been occupied with the flurry of the hurriedtrip . She 'd been unable to make the earliest flights fromNew Orleans to Charleston , West Virginia , and had to waituntil a mid-afternoon one with a layover in Pittsburgh . Shehad n't had time to make arrangements for boarding herdog , Sean , and getting him unloaded from the plane andrenting a car had taken extra time before the 60-mile driveto Sinclair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sleep she 'd lost last night and she was now tiredand feeling slow-witted . Rebecca flipped off the radio . Music that had helped tokeep her awake now blurred into irritating noise . Sheglanced at Sean . " You look fresh as a daisy . No wonder.Thanks to that tranquilizer , you slept through both flights . " The dog gazed at her , panting . " I know you 're not crazyabout kids in general , but I hope you like my nephew Todd.He 'll be crazy about you . " A drop of saliva rolled offSean 's tongue onto the seat . " My mother will like you , too , as long as you do n't drip on any of her beautiful clothes . " When she was a child , Rebecca had adored her lovelymother Suzanne 's thick , wheat-colored hair , azure eyes , andslender-boned body . She 'd had quick , tinkling laughter anda personality that alternated easily between adult and childlike.One evening she could be the gracious , polished hostessat a dinner party . The next morning she couldwholeheartedly throw herself into one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and her brotherJonnie . A sudden pain reamed like a knife in Rebecca 's stomachat the thought of Jonnie . Three years younger than she , Jonathan Patrick Ryan had been a beautiful , happy babywho 'd grown into an agile , high-spirited boy with a cap ofblond curls and a devilish glint in his bright blue eyes.When he was very small he had allowed Rebecca to dresshim up and treat him like her own beloved baby . When hewas older , he 'd shrugged off her coddling and insisted onbeing treated as an equal . In later years they 'd played together , shared secrets , squabbled , tattled on each other , andmanaged to always remain best friends . She had n't beenable to imagine life without him . She had n't thought shewould ever be without him . She 'd been wrong . Sean pawed at her arm , sensing her tension . " We 're almost ... there . " She 'd nearly said home , but Sinclair wasn'thome and had n't been for the eight years since Jonnie hadbeen murdered . She had n't visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was eighteen.She 'd intended never to return . Her stomach tightened as she drove into the Sinclair citylimits . To her right was the huge brick Baptist church thatdated to 1870 . Molly had told her a few ambitious parishionershad lobbied for an addition , but the historic preservationistshad quashed the motion . Ahead , Leland Parkoverlooked the Ohio River . Rebecca had always loved thepark with its tennis courts , rose gardens with brick paths , and two-story River Museum . She noticed that the eightacres of land were as beautifully maintained as always , benches , birdfeeders , and old-fashioned water fountainspainted pristine white . Even the bandstand , built in the early1900s and the site of summer night concerts , looked brand-new.Long ago , Suzanne had brought her and Jonnie to theconcerts . One time Jonnie hid . Certain he 'd fallen into theriver and drowned , Suzanne had promptly lapsed into hysterics.Rebecca had found him hiding under the bandboxand was deeply disappointed when he did n't receive thespanking she would have for playing such a trick . As Rebecca drove through town , she saw that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . About tenyears ago several merchants had banded together in furyover the business drained by the huge new mall that seemedto erupt overnight on the outskirts of town . Their defensehad been to make their establishments appear quaint , thereby channing customers away from the indistinguishablestores in the modern , Muzak-filled mall . The result wasthree town blocks that looked as if they could have beenlifted from a Dickens novel . Rebecca found it unbearablyprecious . And to the best of her knowledge , business hadimproved for only a couple of years until the curiosity woreoff . But the flagging enthusiasm of the merchants for theirbrilliant project showed only in the occasional set of fadedshutters or rust-edged wrought-iron trim . Rebecca slowed as she neared the former Vinson DrugStore , now Vinson 's Apothecary Shoppe . She 'd packed ina hurry and had spent part of her flight time ticking off alist of toiletries she 'd forgotten . The place was still openand stopping here would be much faster than going to themall . She parked and rolled down the windows a fractionso Sean could have fresh air . As she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slate gray sky just turning black . Insidethe store the attempt to keep up the Victorian motif continuedwith Currier &; Ives prints on the walls . A few smallwrought-iron tables and chairs had been placed in front ofa minuscule soda fountain , behind which stood a boredteenage girl chewing gum and flipping through a magazine.At the prescription counter was an array of large , ornatebottles filled with " potions " that were really colored water.She knew the last touch had been the inspiration of MatildaVinson , the store 's owner and pharmacist . Rebecca cursed the unlabeled aisles that made it necessary for her to cruise around until she found body lotion , disposable razors , toothpaste , and a bottle of soaking solutionfor her contact lenses . She picked up an overpricedbag of generic kibble for Sean , promising herself to getsomething better tomorrow , and headed for the checkoutcounter . She paid no attention to the woman behind the registeruntil she noticed the clerk was n't ringing up her purchases.Rebecca glanced up to see silvery gray eyes regarding hercoldly . The woman was young with short platinum hair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feltcolor creep into her face as she realized she was staringinto the face of someone who used to be a close friend . " Hello , Lynn , " she said without false friendliness . " Rebecca . " Lynn Cochran Hardison flicked her lighteyes up and down Rebecca 's slim height . " You 're lookingwell . Life away from Sinclair must agree with you . " " I love New Orleans . " Rebecca pushed her items closerto the cash register as she talked . " How have you been ? " " Fine . Very happily married . " " Good . I 'm glad things are working out for you andDoug . " " Of course they 're working out . We 've always lovedeach other , " Lynn announced as if expecting an argument . " I thought you 'd come to our wedding . After all , Doug isyour stepbrother . " " I knew you did n't want me there , Lynn . " " Why would I ? You caused me a lot of pain , Rebecca . " Rebecca sighed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lynn suddenly looked angry . " We 're having a sale on aspirin . With all those so-calledESP visions rattling around in your head , you must getplenty of headaches . " Here we go , Rebecca thought dismally . The specter ofthe extrasensory perception that had first manifested itselfwhen she was nine was still following her , more of a cursethan a gift . " Lynn , we ca n't change the past , " Rebecca said evenly . " I 'm sorry I 've hurt you , but we 're family now . Ca n't wework at healing old wounds ? " The speech sounded sententious to her own ears andRebecca was n't surprised by Lynn 's scowl . " Forget whathappened ? That would be convenient for you , would n't it ? " Lynn grabbed the toothpaste and jabbed buttons on the register . " Just wreak havoc , then go your merry way , live yourgood life in New Orleans , forget all the damage you'vedone here . " She swiped at the razors and dog food . " AndI heard you 've written a book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sure you did n't mention how yourfabulous ESP suddenly went on the fritz and you didn'tsave him . " Rebecca quietly absorbed the sting of hearing how she'dfailed Jonnie , looking down so Lynn could n't see the painin her eyes . How hard it was to believe this razor-voicedwoman once had been a friend . " My book is n't about Jonnie , " Rebecca managed . " It'sa murder mystery but it 's fiction . " " I would n't know . I sure as hell would n't read it . Andyou owe twenty-two seventy-three . " Rebecca handed over thirty dollars , took her change , andpicked up the plastic bag in which Lynn had stuffed herpurchases . " Good-bye , Lynn . " " I 'll give your regards to Doug , even though you didn'teven bother to ask about him , " Lynn called tartly as Rebeccaheaded for the door . Rebecca closed her eyes when she heard Matilda Vinsonutter a sharp " Lynn ! " as she descended on her employeefor what would surely be a dressing-down . It was deserved , Rebecca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Rebecca ! " Miss Vinson called . " Rebecca , dear , pleaseforgive Lynn . She 's had a long day . " Rebecca smiled at the small , sixty-year-old whirling dervishof a woman who had worked in the drugstore fornearly forty years . " It 's all right . Lynn and I understandeach other . " " I see . " Matilda still looked distressed . " Are you homefor a visit or returning to us for good ? " " Just a visit . " Lynn 's silvery gaze seemed to burnthrough Rebecca and she felt desperate to escape the store . " I 'll be going back to New Orleans in a week or so . " " That 's a shame . We miss you around here . I remember when you were just a little thing and came in with yourfather . I always gave you a butterscotch candy and youacted like I 'd handed you a piece of gold . " Matilda lookedout the front windows . " Good heavens , what a storm isbrewing ! You ca n't go out in this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It 's closing time , " Lynn announced . " I will decide when we close ! " Color rode high on MatildaVinson 's cheeks and Rebecca thought that Lynn mustnot value her job to be so insolent . " Please stay for a fewminutes , Rebecca . " " I ca n't , " Rebecca said abruptly , heading for the door . " I left my dog in the car . He 's terrified of storms . Besides , if I hurry , I can get home before it hits . " " Well , be careful , dear , " Matilda called after her . Outside the wind had picked up sharply . Tree limbs bentbackward and a metal trash can rolled across Main Street.A few raindrops pelted her with stinging force . In the distanceRebecca saw a streak of lightning cast a blue glowagainst the dark sky . She forgot to count until the thunderrumbled , loud and ominous . If she believed in signs , shewould have considered a storm her first night back in Sinclaira bad omen . Wind snapped her long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs . She opened the cardoor and jumped in . Sean nearly leaped onto her lap . Shegrabbed his collar and pushed him back to his seat , speakingsoothingly as he panted in agitation . She handed him arawhide chew stick that he held in his mouth like a cigar , too nervous to eat it . Slowly she pulled away from the curb and started downthe street . She turned up the speed of the windshield wipers.Lightning viciously sliced the sky again and a wave of rainslapped the car hard enough to make her swerve . MainStreet was strangely empty at nine-forty . The marquees ofthe two theaters valiantly tried to glow through the torrentof water . Rebecca doubted if many people had shown upfor the second movie showing . Less than a quarter of a mile ahead , Rebecca sat at whatseemed an interminable red light . Across the intersectionshe noticed a large , white stucco structure with dramatic , sweeping lines . A sign on the front lawn bore the nameDORMAINE 'S RESTAURANT in black lettering bold enoughfor her to see through the rain . She turned left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spear of lightning , making Sean yelpand Rebecca cringe . The lightning had been too close forcomfort , although she knew the robber tires of the car protectedthem from electric shock . A dull throbbing hadstarted at her right temple . It was a familiar pain , althoughshe had n't felt it for quite a while . She would think ofsomething else , forget it , take some aspirin when she gothome . Thank goodness it was n't too much farther to theRyan house , she thought , watching the wipers swipe uselesslyacross the windshield . Back and forth . Back andforth ... The rain-smeared windshield slowly blurred , then began to disappear . Rebecca tried to focus , to shut out all that wasnot tangible , but with dreamlike inevitability , she felt herselfdrift from her own consciousness into someoneelse 's .... Rough cloth was tied around his face and around hismouth . Blindfolded and gagged , that 's what he was . Beneathhim was something hardwood , probablyand hisright hip and arm were numb . Something was tied aroundhis ankles and his hands were pulled behind his back andtrapped by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt sick , like he wanted to throw up , and his headhurt real bad . He thought he might cry , which would beawful because none of his movie heroes would cry and he'dfeel like a complete baby . He tried inhaling deeply in an effort to stop the crying , but the air was hot and smelled awful . Rotten . And he couldhear thunder outside and rain beating against windows.Bright pinpoints of light sparkled in front of his burningeyes . He was afraid . Deathly afraid . Thunder boomed andhe shuddered , pulling himself up into a ball . Uttering gutturalsobs , he inched across the floor until his face touchedsomething soft . Tramp , his stuffed dog . Tramp who savedthe baby from the rat in Lady and the Tramp . Maybe Trampcould save him , too ... Slowly Rebecca 's vision faded . The thoughts of the littleboy were drowned out by the sound of rain pounding onher windshield . The hood of the car pointed toward somethinglarge and looming . Rebecca blinked , aware that she'dreturned to her own reality but unfortunately too late . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car plungedat a giant tree trunk . The noise of screeching metal seemedfar away as the hood of her car crumpled . Rebecca hadworn her seat belt , holding her body in place , but her headsnapped violently forward . Her last sensations were ofblood running down her face and her vision dimming intodarkness.
