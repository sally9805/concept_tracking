<p> They have prosecuted cases against cocaine traffickers and money launderers , bank robbers and organized crime figures , and an international price-fixing cartel . <p> All of which should be good preparation for their current assignment : catching energy traders who manipulated California 's power market during the state 's electricity crisis in 2000 and 2001 . <p> Patrick Robbins , Matthew Jacobs and Lisa Tenorio-Kutzkey are on the front line in the U.S. government 's most serious effort yet to get to the bottom of how widespread market manipulation tactics were in California 's deregulated energy market . <p> The three assistant U.S. attorneys are joined by a team of FBI agents with varied  --  and in some cases colorful  --  backgrounds , who are all part of a dedicated white-collar fraud investigation team based in San Francisco . <p> They are being supervised by two career law enforcement officials  --  U.S. Attorney Kevin Ryan and Mark Mershon , special agent in charge of the San Francisco division . The two men came aboard six months ago , after Robert Mueller , the former U.S. attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They 're all really straight shooters , " said Geoffrey Hansen , the chief assistant federal public defender in San Francisco . " Those are ( the U.S. attorney 's office 's ) rock-bottom core players , who are going to be real conscientious and not controversial in any respect . They 're going to do a good job . " <p> SO-SO REPUTATION <p> That the San Francisco office landed the case was no small feat . The U.S. attorney 's office here has had a reputation for being understaffed and unaggressive , while district offices in Manhattan and Los Angeles emerged as the stars of the system  --  major cases , big victories . <p> Particularly in white-collar crime cases , the San Francisco office has been seen as unwilling to perform the drudgery that such investigations require , such as wading through box after box of documents . <p> " In the past , it has been absolutely dismal , their white-collar section , " said Joe Cotchett , a top securities class-action lawyer in Burlingame . <p> " It has been nowhere . When we filed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think all of that is changing under the new U.S. attorney because he has priorities and has been given resources . <p> " Although everyone is waiting to see how far this investigation is really going to go . " <p> Mueller actually initiated the changes about three years ago , when he formed a unit specializing in white-collar fraud cases . Under his guidance , the unit formed teams of prosecutors and investigators who developed expertise in certain types of cases . <p> Since then , the number of white-collar prosecutions has tripled compared with the three-year period before the initiative was launched . And there have been some notable successes , including the indictment of executives from Critical Path for insider trading and from McKessonHBOC for alleged accounting fraud . Four Critical Path executives have pleaded guilty . One was sentenced to six months in jail , while the other three are awaiting sentencing . Two McKesson executives have pleaded not guilty and are awaiting trial . <p> The emphasis on white-collar prosecutions has picked up speed under Ryan , who has repeatedly stated in public forums that financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 've prioritized it in this district , " Ryan said in a recent interview . <p> POWER CASE <p> The power market manipulation investigation is a so-called " big ticket " case , the kind that lawyers make their names on . If the prosecutors successfully uncover evidence that widespread fraud took place in California 's power market two years ago , it could bring them a volume of publicity that few lawyers ever achieve . <p> Yet it is also a complex and potentially daunting case and could put considerable pressure on the prosecution team since the public desire for a full accounting  --  and accountability  --  has never been fulfilled . It is certainly the biggest case to come through the district in years . <p> The investigation got under way in June , after Enron turned over internal memos to federal power regulators , detailing the company 's strategies to extract inflated profits through dubious schemes . <p> Federal sources say the San Francisco office was initially designated to handle the market manipulation portion of the Enron probe because Leslie Caldwell  --  a former assistant U.S attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justice Department 's Enron task force in Houston  --  believed the local team could get it done . <p> When the inquiry was expanded to include other power companies , several other districts  --  including San Diego , Los Angeles , Houston and Manhattan  --  tried to jump in . But San Francisco was ultimately handed control of the entire investigation . <p> Virtually every power company with a role in California 's market insisted during the crisis that skyrocketing power prices were the result of supply and demand , and blamed the state 's aging power infrastructure for contributing to the problem . <p> EVIDENCE APPEARS <p> But market observers also suggested  --  with little proof at the time  --  that manipulative tactics drove prices higher . Since then , the evidence has begun to come out . <p> In October , local prosecutors secured the first guilty plea from anyone to acknowledge that manipulative tactics were used to game the power market . Timothy Belden , an Enron trader , also agreed to cooperate with the prosecution . The prosecutors are now said to be looking at other Enron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy companies . <p> Robbins and Jacobs are said by judges and defense lawyers to be among the top lawyers in the U.S. attorney 's office here , with a reputation for intelligence and tenacity . Both lawyers were in private practice handling corporate clients before becoming federal prosecutors . <p> Robbins , 40 , a federal prosecutor for eight years , is the chief of the local securities fraud unit , and has handled a number of white-collar and securities fraud cases . <p> He has handled some of the government 's biggest white-collar crime prosecutions in San Francisco . They include securing the guilty pleas of the chief executive and chief financial officer of California Micro Devices to insider trading charges ; winning a conviction against the former chief executive of Granny Goose on obstruction of justice charges stemming from an insider trading investigation ; and , most recently , bringing accounting fraud charges against a former chief executive and a top sales executive of Informix . The former CEO has pleaded not guilty in the case , which is pending . The other executive is in Germany and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NARCOTICS UNIT BACKGROUND <p> Robbins was also deputy chief of the narcotics unit , and secured convictions and five-year sentences against two cocaine traffickers from Australia : Jaime Basalo and Michael Sanderson . <p> " It 's helpful to have a narcotics-organized crime background in white collar cases , " Robbins said in a recent interview . " There 's a pretty good argument that white-collar people should not be treated any different than embezzlers , drug smugglers and gang members . " <p> Jacobs , 41 , is assigned to the securities fraud unit and has distinguished himself by bringing a laser focus to cases that have languished for years . One of them involved the money laundering prosecution of two United Airlines employees who were stealing airplane parts and returning them to a supplier , who then resold them to the airline . <p> Both men were sentenced to prison and ordered to repay millions . One of the employees had to forfeit properties he bought in San Clemente , Orange County ; Lake Tahoe ; and Whistler , British Columbia , as well as a $105,000 Porsche . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lead defendant got 30 years in prison . <p> Tenorio-Kutzkey , 28 , has worked for the U.S. Justice Department 's antitrust division in Washington since graduating from law school four years ago . She has been on loan to the local U.S. attorney 's office since June . <p> She is described as an up-and-comer with antitrust expertise who has gained some trial experience . She tried her first case earlier this summer , a felon in possession of a handgun , and secured a conviction . <p> At the antitrust division , Tenorio-Kutzkey worked on the prosecution of Elf Atochem SA , a French company involved in a price-fixing ring that artificially boosted the cost of chemicals used in commercial manufacturing . Elf pleaded guilty and paid $8.5 million in fines , and one top executive became the first French citizen to plead guilty in a U.S. antitrust case . <p> FBI SQUAD <p> The local prosecutors are being aided by a team of FBI agents that has been specially designated to handle white-collar fraud cases . The unit includes Brian Cook , who worked on the McKesson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hawaii and Korea ; Steve Coffin , who worked as a crime scene investigator in Tahiti and as an Air Force prosecutor in England ; and John Schachnovsky , a former Border Patrol agent in Arizona who has worked on investigations of Mexican drug trafficking cartels . <p> " The office has a very sophisticated white-collar practice that 's really ramped up over the last few years , " said Caldwell . <p> " Patrick Robbins has really been an important part of that increase in sophistication . He 's done some very challenging and really good cases over the last few years . Matt Jacobs also has a proven track record in being able to move cases quickly . Which is absolutely essential in Enron , because things need to happen quickly .
