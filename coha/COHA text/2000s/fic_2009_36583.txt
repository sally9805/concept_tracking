Silence . A dark , calm center absorbing chaos into its stillness . <br> The peaceful rhythm of inhales and exhales . <br> A pulse . The fundamental beat of nature extending into infinity . Awareness of everything and nothing . No thoughts . No dreams . No hungers . Pure existence . Primeval knowing . <br> Floating in the center now . Finally . Singular but also transcendent . Only the pulse in the darkness . Alone , but unified with a larger rhythm , the  --  <br> A disturbance . A small , silent shout of caution and worry intruding into the perfect void . <br> " Why are you creeping around , Phippen ? " <br> " My apologies , my lord . I thought  --  you appeared to be sleeping and I just thought to come in and remove the tray  --  " <br> A louder shout . Fear now . Always fear . The world roared with it . <br> <br> " I will go at once , sir . " <br> " Take the tray , Phippen . Let us make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dismay . Thumps and bumps and the brittle cacophony of metal and crockery crashing . <br> <br> " My abject apologies , sir . The footstool  --  I will have this cleaned off the carpet in a thrice . I will be gone faster than you can say Phippen is a fool . " <br> " Phippen is a fool . I 'll be damned , you are still here . " <br> Noise . Sounds both audible and spiritual . Despera - tion amid clinks and sighs . The dark center shrinking , shrinking . . . <br> Christian , Marquess of Easterbrook , opened his eyes to view the servant whose intrusion had destroyed his meditation . Phippen , his new valet , tried to pick up the tray 's contents without making any noise . Im - possible , of course . A person 's mere existence made noise . <br> Flushed and on his hands and knees , Phippen gingerly placed the cup on the tray , cringing at its tiny sound . He took out his handkerchief to mop up the puddle of coffee threatening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . Pique at himself as well as the new master whose habits made his job too hard . <br> Phippen would not be staying long . Valets never did . Christian rose from his chair and walked over to Phippen . " Give me the tray . I will hold it while you gather the pieces . " <br> " Very good , sir . Thank you , sir . That is too kind of you , my lord . " <br> You are an ass , sir . An eccentric , erratic , incomprehensible  --  <br> Another disturbance . An odd shaking within the remnants of the fading center . Christian closed his eyes and focused on that tremble . Distant but distinct , it had interfered with his meditations too often of late . Today it had taken forever to overcome its effects . <br> He walked to the north windows . No one was in the garden . He paced down the length of his bedchamber to look out the south windows . The kneeling Phippen waved a saucer as he neared . Christian took it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phippen 's empty hand , and strode on . The sound of china tumbling again reached him just as he neared the window . <br> In the street below a carriage waited outside the door of his house . A figure swept toward it , dodging the drizzle that so often accompanied spring weather in London . A woman of middling height and quick step , wearing a deep green dress , hopped into the carriage 's twilight . <br> A delicate nose . An elegant jaw . <br> A melodic sigh from the past . He was sure that he heard it despite the distance and the closed window . <br> His mind shed the last mists of his meditation . His blood reacted , violently . A different pulse now . Hard . Aggressive . He peered with total focus at that carriage . <br> The woman 's face was hidden by the angle of his high view and by her bonnet and the dim light . Her footman closed the door and her fingers reached to pull the curtain . <br> A hand . Her hand . Impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of the carriage , to take his position in the rain . Only then did Christian notice the man . His attention had been so intent on the woman that he had not even seen the footman 's eastern garments and long queue . <br> " A coat , Phippen . Boots . " <br> His valet rose with painful care , balancing the pile of china on the tray . " Very good , sir . I 'll just set this outside the door and  --  " <br> Christian grabbed the tray and slammed it down on a table so hard that the cup jumped . " Boots , man . Now . " <br> Even getting barely dressed took too long . Christian admitted that by the time he descended to the house 's public rooms . <br> Common sense caught up with him at the top of the last flight of stairs . That carriage would be long gone , even with the crush around Grosvenor Square . Whether on foot or horse , he would never be able to follow it . <br> He pivoted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aunt Henrietta and his young cousin Caroline sat together on a settee near one of the tall windows . Blond head to blond head , they gossiped about something . The progress of Caroline 's second season most likely . Anxiety about Caroline 's social life soaked the public rooms with its unceasing rain . It pattered down on him as soon as he opened the chamber 's door . <br> Henrietta greeted him with glistening , vague eyes and an artificial , blank smile . She sought to hide her irritation with his intrusion , which he knew as clearly as if she spoke it . Henrietta and her daughter lived here only because he had agreed to allow it in a rare fit of generosity a year ago . Now Hen wanted everyone to accept her as the mistress of the house , not a guest . Since he accepted nothing of the kind , his company was never welcomed . <br> " Easterbrook , you are up and about early today . " Henrietta 's gaze noted his boots with relief , but her eyes reflected her eternal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . <br> " Is that inconvenient for you , Aunt Hen ? " <br> " Far be it for me to presume inconvenience . It is your home . " <br> " I thought that perhaps you were still receiving callers . I noticed a carriage from my window , and hesitated to come down until your visitor had left . " <br> " You should have joined us , " Caroline said . " You might have enjoyed her company more than Mama did . Our visitor is quite an original . I am surprised Mama did not send her away . " <br> " I almost did , " Hen said . " However , one can never know how it will go with such people . She has both questionable fortune and background , but there is the chance that hostesses will overlook that because she is entertaining . Then where would I be if I had cut her when she made overtures ? " She shook her head with perplexed exasperation . " It is always difficult to judge the odd ones . Nor is she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly odd . There is a difference , Caroline , and one must be alert and careful to  --  " <br> " What is her name ? " Christian asked . <br> His aunt blinked , startled . He never cared to know anything about her callers . <br> " Her name is Miss Montgomery , " Caroline said . <br> " Mama and I met her at a party last week . Her father was a merchant trader in the Far East but she claims a connection to Portuguese nobility through her mother . Miss Montgomery is visiting London for the first time in her life . She journeyed all the way from Macao . " <br> " What did she want ? " <br> His aunt peered his way curiously . " It was a social call , Easterbrook . She only hoped to form a friendship that would help her make her way in town this season . " " I think that she is very interesting , " Caroline added . <br> " Too interesting for a young girl to befriend , " Henrietta said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suspect that she is an adventuress . Quite likely a charlatan too , in her story about her mother 's blood . " <br> " I do not think so , " Caroline said . " I also found her far more stimulating than most of the people who call . " <br> Christian left the drawing room while his aunt and cousin bickered about Miss Montgomery . He sent for the butler , to learn the address that the recent visitor 's calling card had borne . <br> Leona Montgomery stepped around Tong Wei and angled her head toward the looking glass . She gave her reflection a critical gaze while she tied on her bonnet . Young , but not really young . Pretty , but not really pretty . English , but not really English . <br> She sensed people itemizing the qualifications of her countenance and identity when they met her here in London . It had been different in Macao . Everyone there was " not really " something . <br> Tong Wei finally rose from his knees . Leona glanced to the statue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian , but she understood her guard 's devotion very well . Asian religious views affected everything in China , even among the European community . <br> " I should come with you , " Tong Wei said . His expression remained impassive but she knew that he worried about her safety in this noisy , crowded city of so many strangers . " Your brother would expect me to . " <br> " I want to be inconspicuous . " She gazed down at her gray promenade dress . Very English , it had been retrieved from a modiste yesterday . " Since you refuse to dress as a proper English footman , you can not accompany me . " <br> They both knew that even English garments would not make Tong Wei into a proper-looking footman . His shaved brow and long queue , his round face and distinctive eyes , marked him as Chinese even more than the beautifully embroidered shafts of garnet-toned cloth that composed his exotic clothing today . <br> " Take Isabella with you , " he said . " It is not common to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <br> Isabella looked up . Her brush froze , poised over the paper on which she drew elegant images from her adventures . " I do not mind wearing my English clothes , " she said . " Tong Wei may think them barbaric , but I am not so pure . " <br> Isabella referred not only to her opinions . Half Chinese and half Portuguese , she was a hybrid of East and West . If Isabella now wore a loose qipao , it was for comfort as much as preference . <br> " I will only be at the Royal Exchange for a short while . I am merely going to see how this big trading house is organized , so that I can walk in with confidence another time . If it is similar to the factories in Canton , it will be so busy that no one will notice me . " Leona trusted it would happen that way . Her ensemble had been chosen to be subdued . There were times when she did not want to turn heads for any reason . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isabella asked . <br> A little shiver of foreboding and excitement intruded on Leona 's composure . The ambivalent reaction happened whenever Edmund was mentioned during this journey . <br> " I will not see him there . He was a gentleman , and they do not engage in trade . " She had realized , since coming to London , that Edmund had been a gentleman in the true English meaning of the word . She now comprehended fully what that meant in this world of her father . <br> Of course , a man could be a gentleman and still be what Edmund had claimed , a naturalist and adventurer . A gentleman could even still be a thief . <br> " Then maybe you will eventually see him again in one of the drawing rooms that you visit , " Isabella said . It would be useful if she did . She suspected that one of her missions in London might be accomplished much more quickly if she and Edmund faced each other again . <br> By the by , Edmund , just how big a scoundrel are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really English , but English enough for today 's purpose . The not-really-young and not-really-pretty parts should help her be invisible . <br> " I doubt that I will be gone more than two hours , " she said . " While I am away , Isabella , please see if you can encourage that cook that I hired to make a dinner that is not so bland . " <br> Continues ...
