Death had never particularly interested Bob Ferguson as a subject of study . It was a fact in and of itself , without nuance . His religious instruction  --  Ferguson had gone to parochial schools and a Catholic college  --  taught him to view death as a necessary passage , but the nuns , brothers , and priests who had instructed him tended to focus on either side of the gateway , rather than death itself . <br> As a CIA officer assigned to the Agency 's covert Special Demands team , Ferguson had had a great deal of experience with death ; he had often been its agent and provocateur . Still , his relationship was purely professional ; he remained neither intrigued nor moved by any aspect of the subject itself . The end of life was simply the end of life . The manner of its coming rarely interested him . <br> Ferguson 's nonplussed expression as the video played on the small screen at the end of the study bothered his host , CIA Director Thomas Parnelles . Unlike Ferguson , Parnelles contemplated death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its most brutal forms , and particularly when it involved someone he knew . The fact that the death on the screen involved both was particularly upsetting ; it had happened to a man who worked for him , and required justice , if not vengeance . <br> Parnelles had known Ferguson for a very long time  --  since Ferguson was born , in fact . He had been Ferguson 's father 's closest friend , and on more than one occasion served in loco parentis when Ferguson Sr. was out of the country . Parnelles assumed because of these things not only that he knew the young man well , but that Ferguson shared his feelings on any matter worthy of having one . So the half smile on Ferguson 's face , the completely unmoved expression that was characteristic of the young man , annoyed Parnelles greatly . He finally reached over and clicked the laptop key to end the video just as it focused on the dead man 's battered skull . <br> Unsure why the video had stopped , Ferguson took a sip of bourbon from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasantly at his throat as it went down . <br> " Technical problems , General ? " Ferguson asked . <br> " There 's not much more , " said Parnelles . He flipped off the laptop , momentarily shrouding the study in darkness . When he turned on the light , Ferguson had the exact same expression on his face . " Are you feeling all right , Bobby ? " <br> " Never better . " <br> " North Korea was difficult , I know . " <br> " Change of pace . " Ferguson tilted the glass . The bourbon was Johnny Drum Private Stock , a well-aged small-batch whiskey more distinctive than such standards as Maker 's Mark or Jim Beam . That was one thing about Parnelles  --  he did not have standard anything . <br> " Ordinarily , I would tell you to sit down for a while , and take some time off , " said Parnelles . " More than the few days you 've had . But this is a priority . This is important . " <br> " Not a problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take two or three months off . Lay on the beach . " <br> " I 'll just get bored . " Ferguson leaned forward , stretching his back and neck . " So Michael Dalton was killed in Puys , France , two years ago . Then what happens ? " <br> " Then we spend two years trying to figure out who did it . " Parnelles took his own drink from the edge of his desk and walked over to the chair near Ferguson . He told himself he was seeing the younger man 's professional distance , nothing more . " We found this video from the bank 's surveillance camera . We re-created Dalton 's movements . We checked everyone who had stayed in the hotels nearby for up to two weeks before . " <br> " Why was he there ? " <br> " Vacation . " <br> Ferguson smirked . <br> " No , really , he was taking a vacation , " said Parnelles . " This is an out-of-the-way town on the Channel . He liked France , and he 'd just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <br> " What did the French say about the murder ? " <br> Parnelles settled down in his seat and took a sip of his drink  --  Scotch  --  before answering . <br> " The local police , of course , were incompetent . They believed it was a terrorist attack . " <br> " Just because a car blew up ? " <br> " I really do n't know why you 're being sarcastic , Robert . You 're not taking this seriously . " <br> Ferguson took another sip of the bourbon . Generally Parnelles was n't quite this worked up . In fact , Ferguson could n't remember the last time Parnelles had briefed him personally on a mission  --  let alone asked him up to Maine to do so . <br> " Yes , it did look as if it were the work of terrorists , " admitted Parnelles . " But why terrorists would blow up a car at that place and time  --  of course the police had no answers . A small village on the French coast ? Terrorists would never operate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to the ministry , of course , but they got it into their heads that we were lying . " <br> " About what ? " <br> " That Michael was working , instead of being on vacation . " <br> " Was he ? " <br> " You 're being very contrary tonight , Robert . I just told you he was n't . " <br> Bad publicity about the CIA 's secret rendition program had caused a great deal of friction in Europe just prior to Dalton 's death . The French believed that the Agency was withholding information about what Dalton had been working on  --  they thought it involved something in France  --  and in Parnelles 's view had been less than cooperative out of spite . <br> Ferguson  --  who admittedly had never cared much for anything French , let alone their spies  --  knew that the French security service seldom displayed anything approaching alacrity , even when pursuing their own priorities . But he let that observation pass . <br> " If Dalton was targeted , then something must have happened in Asia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <br> " Unimportant , Bob . The point is , what I 'm getting to  --  we know who killed him . He was a contract killer known as T Rex . " <br> " Like the dinosaur . " <br> " Exactly . He kills everything in his wake . He 's extreme . T Rex . " <br> Actually the name had been used in a text message intercepted by the National Security Agency just before another assassination , this one of a wealthy businessman visiting Lisbon . Ferguson had already seen the information in the text brief of his mission . There had been other " jobs " as well : T Rex had been implicated in the murder of a Thai government minister and a suspected fund-raiser for Hezbollah , to name just two . Parnelles ran down the list of known and suspected victims , impressive in both length and variety . <br> Tired of sitting , Ferguson began bouncing his right leg up and down . His foot was just touching the fringe of a hand-woven wool rug Parnelles had retrieved from Iran toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Parnelles had said once . It was all he said , ever , on the subject to Ferguson . <br> " You seem distracted , Bobby . " Parnelles glanced at Ferg 's foot , tapping on the carpet . <br> " Foot fell asleep . " Ferguson bounded up from the chair . " Ca n't sit too long . " <br> He did a little jig in front of the chair . " So what 's the real story , General ? Who is T Rex ? " <br> " We do n't know . " <br> " The Israelis hired him , and we ca n't figure it out ? " <br> " The Israelis did n't hire him , " said Parnelles . " Hezbollah has a lot of enemies . Including Hezbollah itself . " <br> " So what do you want me to do ? " <br> " Figure out who he is . Apprehend him . Bring him here for trial . " <br> " That 's what Slott told me this afternoon . " Ferguson glanced at his watch . " Yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and walked around the study . It was as familiar to him as his own condo  --  more so . He 'd played hide-and-seek here as a kid . <br> Taking T Rex in Italy was sensitive . The Agency was still smarting over a well-publicized trial of several of its members , fortunately in absentia , for the rendition of a suspected terrorist a few years before . The Italian court had found that the man was not a terrorist and had been kidnapped by the CIA , albeit with help from the Italian secret services . The political situation argued for the use of the elite First Team  --  officially , the Office of Special Demands  --  a small group of highly trained operatives headed by Ferguson and occasionally assisted by a Special Forces army group . <br> But the job might have been done by other CIA agents , including a special paramilitary team trained in renditions . <br> " So when I bring back T Rex , " said Ferguson , " what happens ? You put him on trial ? " <br> Parnelles frowned . <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought to trial , " he said , picking his words very carefully , " that would be something we could all live with .
