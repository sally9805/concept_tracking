<p> Dear Fixer : I 'm trying to get a rebate for my son , who is working in Afghanistan . <p> He made some purchases at Tiger Direct in Orland Park in May , including a Computer Associates Security Suite 200 , which had two mail-in rebates with a total value of $70 . <p> After we applied for the rebate , they sent everything back , including my envelope ! They did not indicate what I failed to do . Please help ! <p> Stephanie Opyd , Tinley Park <p> Dear Stephanie : Thanks for providing us with the latest example of why The Fixer hates rebates . . . just in time for the holiday shopping season . Rebates hook us in , but sometimes they 're oh-so-hard to redeem . <p> Along with your letter , you sent photocopies of your rebate forms , the register receipts , UPC labels and a letter from Tiger Direct saying your claim was found to be out of compliance because of one or more reasons , including failure to provide a copy of the invoice , failing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide UPC labels . <p> Huh ? We got in touch with a Tiger Direct executive , Russell Strunk , who immediately forwarded your info to another helpful man at the Florida company , Julio Somohano . <p> Less than 24 hours later , we heard back from Somohano , who said they could n't find any paperwork associated with your rebate request ( of course , since they had mailed it all back to you ) , but that " in the spirit of good customer service " they would validate the rebate and send you a check within five to seven business days . <p> For more on rebates , go to www <p> . suntimes.com , click on " Columnists " and " The Fixer " and look under " Consumer tips . " <p> DEBIT DILEMMA <p> BANK HOLDS DEPOSIT , CHARGES OVERDRAFT FEES <p> Dear Fixer : Regarding last week 's letter about " bounced " debit card transactions , I had the same thing happen to me . <p> I live in Northwest Indiana . I banked with Bank Calumet , and they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank at 12:01 a.m. each Friday . But the new bank , First Midwest , did not give me access to this money until 2 p.m. the following Monday . <p> Needless to say , all my electronic payments , set go out each Friday , incurred a $35 charge from First Midwest . They made the payments and charged me the overdraft fees . <p> I went in to my branch and pitched a royal fit . The manager wanted me to lower my tone and volume in their lobby . When she refunded me the $412 in overdraft charges , I went away  --  right down the street to a competitor bank , where I get immediate access to any check deposited . <p> Keep on fixing stuff . I enjoy the column . <p> Bob Kaplar , Crown Point , Ind . <p> SIGNED , SEALED , NOT DELIVERED <p> BLACKTOP COMPANY DID N'T FIX CRUMBLING ASPHALT DRIVEWAY <p> Dear Fixer : My issue is with Richards Blacktop in Worth . I called for their services in April of this year , and they provided a prompt response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveyed and provided me a competitive estimate immediately . <p> This no-nonsense approach earned them the project , and Richards installed a new driveway in early May . I gave them final payment while they were installing the asphalt . I had to go to work and figured it was not an issue to pay upfront without a final inspection . <p> Unfortunately , I had an issue with an area about 5 feet square . The asphalt was loose and breaking apart in this area . I immediately called but had to leave a message . After four phone calls and 48 hours without a response , I sensed a serious lack of customer service . Therefore , I immediately put a stop payment on the check . <p> Lo and behold , almost three weeks later , my wife gets a call from Sylvia , Troy 's mother , requesting an appointment time to be set for Troy to come out and take a look , assuring her that all problems will be resolved . <p> Two days later , Troy comes out and surveys my concern of asphalt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told him nobody had driven on it since it was installed . I suggested it 's a bad section of asphalt , but he disputed this and started speaking about his experience with asphalt . <p> I am not proficient in this arena , but anybody could see that something was wrong with this specific area . <p> Troy downplayed it and assured me of his one-year guarantee . He told me that a good sealer would provide the solution to my concern , and the asphalt peeling away would subside . <p> I allowed the sealing to occur at the end of May and provided them with a check for the balance . The decaying slowed down for a while . <p> It is now October , and I have an area of loose asphalt that is twice as large the original area . It will continue to degrade until there is a pothole in my driveway , I am told by two other blacktop professionals who said that could happen in about two years . <p> So , it looks like I just bought a driveway that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I have been trying since mid-September to get someone from Richards to return my call . I have called them at least six times since then . <p> I trusted these guys and gave them the benefit of the doubt , and it seems I am getting burned . I believed the sealing of the driveway would keep it from peeling , but it has n't . <p> Jim Brady , Tinley Park <p> Dear Jim : We left a couple of messages for Troy with his answering service and finally heard back from his mother , Sylvia , who schedules his appointments . She claims there 's nothing major wrong with your driveway but agreed to have Troy come out and reseal that portion again . As of last week , you still had n't gotten a call from them . Keep us posted . <p> JUST THE FAX <p> THEY 'VE GOT HIS NUMBER , AND THEY 'RE USING IT <p> Dear Fixer : I know in the scheme of things , this ai n't a big one , but the problem persists , and I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all hours . <p> Each week , I get three to four unwanted faxes , soliciting me for everything from insurance to advertising to tires . <p> The Saturday morning ones at 7:30 a.m. are particularly annoying . <p> I faithfully phone the number on the bottom of the page , ( 888 ) 214-9322 or ( 888 ) 214-4322 are two popular ones , to delete my fax number from their call list . It never works ; they still keep a-comin ' . <p> I 'm sure there are others out there with this problem . <p> Can you help ? <p> J.G. Bloom , Chicago <p> Dear J.G. : Looks like you 've been blasted by the notorious My Hot Leads , the same people who brought us American Blast Fax and Sunbelt Marketing . These folks , who appeared to be based in Addison , Texas , have run afoul of authorities in Texas and Minnesota for spamming people 's fax machines with this garbage and are being sued in federal court for allegedly violating consumer protection laws . <p> We got a phone number for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and left a detailed voice message asking him to delete your fax number from their call list . <p> For more on My Hot Leads and how to stop this stuff , check out this anti-spam Web site : **43;495;TOOLONG . <p> BUYER BEWARE <p> We all felt terrible about the recent California wildfires , but watch out for a new e-mail scam that appears to be a solicitation from the U.S. government for charitable contributions to victims . It urges the recipient to click on a link , which leads to a fake IRS Web site .
