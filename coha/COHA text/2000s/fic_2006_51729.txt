I HAVE A THEORY : The world is made up of two kinds of people , those who know what 's coming next and those who do n't have a clue . My father knew what was coming next ; he just could n't bear to watch , or could n't bear to watch in a normal unaffected state , so he scrambled himself to fuzz the view . He knew what was in store for him , how it was all going to end . I 'm the same . I do n't kid myself into thinking things are all right when they are n't , and I do n't hold out unrealistic expectations , and I do n't hope against hope . The first time I saw my wife , I did n't say to myself , That 's the girl I 'm going to marry ; I just thought , There 's someone I 'd like to sit next to for a few minutes if she 'll let me . She had long straight black hair , a few strands tucked behind her ears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to see , and no makeup I could detect . Very natural . She was in the bar with some of her girlfriends , all of whom had scattered , leaving her alone at a large round table covered with glasses . A song was playing- " Trouble " by Lindsey Buckingham-that later , in a fit of irony , we adopted as our song . She laughed when I sat down . She laughed at everything that whirled around her : waiters , dancers , smoke , my words that got lost in the pulsating air . I finally shouted , " Are you drunk ? " - not as a reproach but as a simple question . She stood up and gripped the table for balance . " Yes I am , " she said , laughing and whirling and falling into my arms as I stood up to catch her . <p> The first year we were married , my wife signed up to become a volunteer reader for the blind . Why she chose the blind was slowly revealed to me , in small increments of awareness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She did it suddenly , on an impulse , infused with the need to help someone less fortunate , someone less than whole . A few months before , she had volunteered for the Samaritans , trying to talk people out of suicide , but she was n't very good at it because with her optimism still intact , she had no idea why people would think of such a thing to begin with . As far as reading to the blind , it had been years since she 'd read aloud in any kind of formal way-who does it anymore once you 're out of school ? - so she practiced on me . At first she read from a volume of Billy Collins 's poems ( " The Wind is ghosting around the house tonight " ) until she decided that poetry was too easy because it was meant to be recited and she would probably be reading things that were n't , like items from a tabloid newspaper or People magazine celebrity articles or the illegible writing from faded letters written years before . To have letters read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request of the blind , the woman at the volunteer agency had said . There are books on tape but no letters from your children and grandchildren on tape , no letters from your late husband or wife on tape , no personal diary entries on tape . A reader , like a disc jockey , must take requests . So my wife read some of the love letters I had written her . We both laughed at how flowery and full of it I was and how utterly shameless as a suitor . <p> I was in sales then . I usually got to the office around ten , a full hour late , and had to deal with my managers evil eye and some daily crisis , like the double sale of a used computer system that was carted off by someone else 's customer after I had sold it to one of mine . I had been working there for two months , and after a fast start I had tailed off a bit , like a hitter whose mechanics are a bit off and hits everything foul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not even a drink , a beer . I had one drink on the way home , at the bar in the motel near the supermarket , and I always walked away after one . Good for you , the bartender usually said . Good for you . <p> The first morning , my wife left me a note on the bathroom mirror : Gone reading . The blind person she was assigned to lived in an assisted care facility two towns away , close enough for her to find her way on mostly familiar and lightly trafficked back roads . The facility was set back from the road , approached via a long straight driveway lined with impressive shrubbery , the building disguised-my wife 's word when she described it to me later-to look like a bed-and-breakfast you 'd find in Maine : an oversized house with columns and a wraparound porch . It was called HorizonHouse . The lobby was all muted greens and grays , and sunlight filtered down from an overhead atrium . A nurse led her down a bright clean hallway to a small room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red overstuffed chair , head cocked and moving slowly from side to side , a study in anticipation . Directly opposite him was a metal folding chair , on the seat of which a folded newspaper had been placed . His hands were on his thighs , as though he was about to stand up at any moment . <p> " Mr. Marcotte , " the nurse said , " this is Maria . Your new reader . " <p> " Maria . " His voice was high-pitched and nasally . He wore a blue-checked shirt , short-sleeved , bunched up at the neck , too big for his frail frame . His hairless arms were speckled with bruises the size of dimes and quarters . He wore a watch that she later found out had no case so he could tell the time through touch , but that she found out later still had stopped for lack of a new battery . He had dark sunglasses , the kind that bend around the eyes with extended flaps , like a mask . <p> My wife did n't know if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she did put it out , how would he know ? Would the nurse have to intervene and tell him that the reader had her hand extended ? Would it cause an awkward moment ? Would she instantly show her utter lack of sensitivity ? She ended up keeping her hands by her side . <p> " Mr. Marcotte likes the sports section , " the nurse said . <p> " Call me Paul , " he said quietly . He dropped his chin to his chest and she saw that his hair was nearly gone and long red lines , like cat scratches , ran across his scalp . It seemed he had fallen asleep and then he lifted his head with a sudden jerk and seemed to look straight at her . <p> " Please sit down , Maria , " he said . <p> My wife sat down . She sensed him smelling her , breathing her in and catching what he could of her soap , shampoo , deodorant , the Liz Claiborne cologne she had put on for the occasion . <p> " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and together they listened to her squeaky-soled departure . <p> " That 's Margaret , " he said . <p> " She 's very nice , " my wife said . <p> " They say she 'd be pretty if she lost weight . " The man leaned forward and asked , " Are your eyes brown ? " <p> " They 're black . " <p> " Is your hair black , too ? " No . " She fidgeted . She was eager to begin . " Should I start with the sports section ? " <p> " In a minute . " He adjusted his hands in his lap and sat there , smiling , rolling his head ever so slightly , not so much side to side as back and forth . He seemed enormously pleased to be in her presence . " Are you married ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " You have children ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Why not ? " <p> " We 've been married less than a year . " Followed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth . " Paul , do you have any letters you want me to read ? " <p> " Letters ? From who ? Who sent me a letter ? " <p> " I just thought you might have some you wanted me to read . " <p> " I never get any letters . Except from the government explaining my benefits . I have them somewhere if you want to read them . " <p> " That 's all right . " <p> She did n't know what to do next . They sat there , maybe three feet apart , and she was alert to every sound , including her own breathing , which seemed , for some reason , unusually labored . A door opened and closed somewhere . He had his head tilted toward her , as if in some pose of expectation . Finally she noisily opened the newspaper to the sports section . <p> He held up his hand to stop her . " Tell me one thing , Maria . Are you a sad person ? You seem sad . Are you ? Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad as you seem ? " <p> The next week she found him lying in bed , holding onto a shiny object that glittered when he turned it over in his hand . At first she thought it was a knife-how could they have let him sneak one out of the dining room ? - but it was actually a gold Cross pen which , he showed her , had his initials engraved on the side : PEM . It had been a gift from his wife when he was still sighted . At first he thought it was a misspelling of the word " pen " until his wife pointed out that those were his initials . He knew people who put their initials on their clothes and on their license plates , but he was never one of those . Maybe she should have known that about him by then , but no matter , he did n't get it . He wished he could have that moment back so he could feign delight . One of the ten thousand times he disappointed her . His wife was named Irene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair ; even after it had lost its color , she kept it red ; you could n't miss her in a crowd . <p> " Do you have a picture ? " <p> He smiled at the question . <p> " I 'm sorry . " <p> " Do n't do that , " he said . " Do n't apologize . " <p> He asked my wife to describe the shoes she was wearing . They made quite a unique sound , he said . Usually he was very good at identifying not only the peculiar rhythm of a persons gait but their shoes as well , because shoes talk-and not because they have tongues , ha ha , but because they have a vocabulary all their own . But he just could n't get hers . She took one off and placed it in one of his hands . <p> He let it sit in the palm of his hand , then let his fingers follow the trail of straps until they landed on the buckle at the back . " Sandals , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Plain white ? " <p> " Well , actually they 're bone . " <p> She handed him the other one . He took one in each hand and moved them back and forth in a little pantomime of walking . " Someone should invent seeing eye shoes . " <p> " That 's a good idea , " she said . <p> " That 's my joke , " he said . He did n't give the shoes back to her but put them side by side , next to him on the bed . <p> He still delayed her reading until it was time for her to go . He lay there , and every time there was a stray sound he labeled it for her . <p> " That 's the boy with the medicine cart . " <p> " That 's Mrs. Martinez . " <p> " Visitors to see Mrs. Greene two rooms down . She has Alzheimer 's . She does n't remember who they are , but they keep coming every Wednesday even though she would n't know the difference if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't . " <p> When he fell asleep , she lifted the pen from his hand and placed it on the small crowded table next to his bed . It surprised her to see there a small pad of paper among the crumpled tissues and the water bottle and a mostly empty box of chocolates . For some inexplicable reason she had the urge to leave him a note : You fell asleep . I 'll see you next time . But she stopped herself and left in her bare feet . <p> The next week , there was an ambulance and a fire truck in front of the facility when she arrived . A few staff members stood by the open ambulance doors , talking to the driver who was explaining something to them with sweeping hand motions , like he was describing the arc of a comet . Mr. Ishikato , the Japanese man two doors down from Mr. Marcotte , had fallen down and died right after breakfast . He was gone in an instant , though they tried to revive him and called the ambulance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools of revival . He was a friend of Mr. Marcotte 's , one of the nurses told my wife . They had meals together , sitting at the same table every time . Some meals , maybe most meals , they did n't say a word , but they faithfully sat across from each other . Mr. Ishikato cut up Mr. Marcottes meat for him , salted and peppered his food , moved things like glasses and ketchup bottles within easy reach or , as the case might be , out of harms way . Mr. Marcotte was in his room now and had given instructions that no one was to bother him . <p> My wife went to see him . There was music coming from his room , some kind of jazz , big band . He sat in his chair in its customary place , the radio in his lap the way another person might hold a book . <p> " Paul ? " <p> " Go away , Maria . " <p> " I 'm sorry about what happened . " <p> " Not today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you were all right . " She stood there staring right at him-an unfair advantage , a one-way mirror-until he said , rather sharply , " I do n't hear you leaving . " <p> She was walking away when he called out her name . <p> " Yes ? " <p> " What color is the sky today ? " <p> She went to the window at the back of his room and saw that it was an ordinary summer blue , that translucent pale blue , with a few smudges of white cloud , and that 's what she described to him . <p> " I miss the sky , " he said . She waited to see if he was going to say something else , and when it was apparent he was n't , when she saw his head fall forward again toward the rising waves of music , she slipped out of the room . <p> My wife liked to go for long walks in the hills and woods behind our neighborhood . One night that summer , she left for one of her walks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle-and when she did n't return by nine o'clock , I went out with a flashlight to look for her . I had a superficial knowledge of the trails , having walked them a few times with a bottle of my own , and knew that the main trail splintered off into three different minitrails and that one of these was festooned with poison ivy because I 'd gotten a bad case the last time I was in there . I was thinking that if I did n't find her within half an hour , I 'd call the police , and I kept imagining that call over and over , using wooden phrases like , My wife is missing . . . . Yes , she was acting normal as far as I could tell . . . . No , she 's never been gone this long . It was like walking inside a dark humid tunnel , even with the flashlight pointed at my feet and illuminating the next steps I should take . Within five minutes , maybe less , I was lost . The way the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on the original trail or had veered off onto one of the tributaries . Above , the trees all but blocked out the purple sky and the few dim stars . I had this fleeting panic that something terrible had happened and I started to run , really run , with the flashlight bobbing unsteadily so it lit up the tops of trees and then plunged to protruding roots in the ground ; and in the middle of it all , by pure accident , I saw her . I 'm not sure how I ended up in the spot where she was , what inner navigation took me there . She was sitting on a rock , arms folded , head down . " I 'm sorry , David , " she said . <p> " It 's all right , do n't worry , " I said . " You just got disoriented . You scared me . " I put my arm around her . Then I took her home . <p> " Hello , Paul . " <p> " Hello , Maria . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " That would be nice . " <p> " I brought a magazine . " <p> It was a travel magazine . She read him an article about Machu Picchu , the lost city of the Incas in the Peruvian Andes . The writer , a man in his thirties , interwove the description of the ruins with a subplot about his intention to ask his girlfriend to marry him at sunrise when they were sitting on one of the embankments and watching the sun come up over the peaks . He had been planning it for over a year . All seemed to go according to plan . They passed through the gates in the predawn darkness-only people who stayed at the hotel right next to the ruins got to do this-and sat on damp stony ground facing east . The sun began to rise . It was as though a painter had taken a brush and slowly spread a marigold wash over the dark green mountain crests . He got down on one knee . Just as he was about to ask the question , the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altitude or maybe from the weight of the occasion . Within seconds she was sitting up again , looking at him quizzically , trying to smooth her hair and regain the anticipatory smile that had been on her face . But the moment had passed . He took it as a sign . He never would ask her again . " He 's a fool , " the old man said . <p> He asked Maria to read him some headlines . If he liked the headline , she could read him the story . If he did n't , they 'd go on to the next headline . <p> The first headline was , " Man Completes Backward Ascent of Mt . Ranier . " She waited but he remained silent , unmoved . <p> " Town Sees Virgin Mary in Shape of Dying Tree . " <p> " 100-Year-Old French Woman Goes Back to School . " <p> " Your hands are shaking , " he said . <p> " What ? " <p> " I can hear them . " <p> " They 're not . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Of what then ? " <p> " I 'll read something else . " <p> So she read the sports section , starting with the lead story- " Red Sox Lose in 10th " - all the way to the high-school summer league baseball and softball games , the one-sentence recaps of European soccer matches , the sports on TV listings . <p> " I need to go now . I 'm meeting my husband somewhere . " <p> " Where are you meeting him ? " <p> " At a restaurant . It 's his birthday . " <p> " How old ? " <p> " He 's thirty-three . " <p> " What 's his name ? " <p> " David . " <p> " David . From the Bible . The King of Israel . " <p> " He 's a salesman . " <p> " What does he sell ? " <p> " Right now he sells computers . " <p> " They say computers are the future , " he said . " Do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they 're really the future . " <p> She started going to see him every day . The program called for a once a week commitment but she went every morning at the same time , leaving the house at 10:30 AM , even on Sundays , and at least twice a week she drove back out after dinner to read him something in the fading light . For the nighttime visits he 'd be in his pajamas , usually sitting in his chair , facing out the window into a night sky he could n't see , full of stars and streaks , the winking lights of airplanes , the transient flash of fireflies , my wife 's reflection in the glass as she stood in the doorway , fresh reading material in hand . <p> " Maria , is that you ? " <p> He had nightmares , most having to do with helplessness in a natural disaster , most often a fire that forced him to feel his way along heated and peeling walls , flames darting at his ankles , setting his clothes on fire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a stretch two or three times , it was a good night . His stomach was bad ; he was constipated most of the time . His blindness had been the result of glaucoma that developed when he was already seventy-seven and in no mood to look after himself ; he never thought he 'd live long enough to go blind . He was eighty-four now . His wife died eleven years ago , and he was so sure he 'd follow her within hours of her death , he walked home from the hospital and put on his best suit-he only had two-and sat on the couch and waited for God to take him . Except God does n't work like that . To God you 're just another man sitting on a couch . " Do you believe in God , Maria ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Do you believe in fate ? " <p> She could n't answer right away . The question caught her by surprise , and she felt as though somehow he had been unfair to her , rude even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him yes . Yes , she believed in fate . <p> She told him a story about the night we were married , in Boston . There was a heavy angry rain that started in the early afternoon and by early evening had flooded every depression and pothole and low-lying corner in the city , causing traffic jams and electrical brownouts , including one at the hotel where our wedding was set to take place in a function room , now plunged into darkness . We had fifty guests who had to sit in the lobby waiting for the electricians to do their magic . The caterers started serving the cold hors d'oeuvres in a swale of candlelight while I , presumptive groom , sat with my best man and a few others in a round of hard-backed chairs , smoking and waiting . As the bride , Maria was supposed to be hidden away , per tradition , in the suite we would later sleep in ; but she had come down and squatted at the top of the circular staircase that overlooked a portion of the lobby . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the periphery until he decided to go across the street to a bar whose lights still burned , for just one drink . An hour later the hotel lights came on . Shortly after that , two maintenance men from the hotel had to retrieve my father , carry him across the street in the rain , and set him down in a chair at the back of the function room so he could see the ceremony ( he ended up falling asleep ) . She knew then . She saw the future with me as clearly as she had ever seen anything . But it was too late to turn back . <p> " I understand , " the blind man said . " Now you can read to me . " <p> Toward the end of the summer she informed Paul that she was planning a trip . She had bought an airplane ticket , one-way . Renewed her passport . Bought a few clothes , a new suitcase , a new pair of shoes , some books , some small appliances , but all of it gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a little bit at a time , for two months . <p> " Where are you going ? " <p> " Spain . My sister is there , with her family . They have an apartment in Barcelona with an extra room . I 'm going to live with them for a while . " <p> " For how long ? " <p> " I do n't know . " <p> He considered that . " I 've never been to Spain . " <p> " Barcelona 's beautiful . Very open . Wide avenues . Lots of green . The whole city 's alive . " <p> " Where is your ticket ? " <p> " In my bag . " <p> " Read it to me . " <p> She got it out , lifting the actual ticket from its heavy jacket . " Depart Boston 11:30 AM . Arrive Paris midnight . Depart Paris 9:00 AM . Arrive Barcelona 11:18 AM . " <p> He asked to hold it . When she handed it to him , he put it under his nose and slowly ran his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you leaving ? " <p> " Soon . " <p> " Will you be back tomorrow ? " <p> " Yes , of course I 'll be here tomorrow . " <p> " I had a dream about you , " the old man said the next day . " You were sitting on the top of a great flight of steps and there was a city down below you . All the roofs were bright red . The sun was out . You were crying . " <p> " How do you know it was me ? " <p> " It was you . " <p> She could n't stay long , she said . She had things to do : water the plants , pick up drycleaning , do laundry ( hers and mine ) , throw out some meats too old to be eaten now . She also had a letter to write . It would take a while because she wanted to get it exactly right and she was not a fast writer even under the best circumstances , as when it was just a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really matter . Her mother wrote wonderful letters that just spilled out effortlessly , she said ; but for her , writing was torture . She would probably be up all night writing it , tearing it up , writing it all over again . <p> He listened with total concentration , his mouth slightly open . " Will you be back tomorrow ? " <p> " No . " <p> He nodded . " They 'll try to find me a new reader . They 're very good at finding people . " <p> Early the next morning she woke me up and asked me to do her a favor . <p> " Anything , " I said . <p> " Go read to Mr. Marcotte . He 's expecting me today . " <p> " Why are n't you going ? " <p> " I think I 'm getting a cold , I do n't want him to catch it , he 's so susceptible to germs . There must be something wrong with his immune system because he 's always trying to fight something off . Its better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go do some other errands . " She got out of bed and walked to the bathroom . <p> I made two wrong turns trying to find the place . The entranceway was marked by a small green sign too subtle to see at a distance , the name HORIZONHOUSE in gold lettering with a multispiked sun shining above them . I checked my eyes and my hair in the mirror before I got out of the car . I smoothed down the front of my shirt . At the front desk I introduced myself and got instructions to the room . My wife had described the place as well lit and well scrubbed , so clean it made you want to turn and run . She was right . I tried to shut down my peripheral vision and not look in any of the other rooms I passed , but I could n't help catching flashes effaces looking out to see who was coming , whether someone was coming to see them . <p> I knocked on his open door . " Mr. Marcotte ? " <p> " Call me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed . " Are you going to stand there or are you going to come in ? " <p> He was a small , thin old man , nearly bald , wearing wraparound sunglasses . The chair he was in was like a big red raft with him floating in the middle of it ; another chair was set up opposite him . I told him that my wife was n't feeling well and that I was filling in for today . <p> " That 's very kind of you , David , " he said . <p> " You know my name . " <p> " She told me all about you . " <p> I sat down . The first thing that I saw in his room was a pair of her shoes , her white summer sandals , on his dresser , next to a pile of newspapers . There was little else to notice . Nothing on the walls , nothing on the bulletin board behind his bed except for a few sheets of paper hanging by a thumbtack . A nightstand had some balled up tissues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " David ? " <p> " Yes , Paul ? " <p> " Why are your hands shaking ? " <p> " I must be nervous , " I said . " I 've never done this before . " <p> " It s not hard . I promise you . " <p> He asked me if I would read him some headlines . I turned to page two of the newspaper , to the section where they had these human interest stories that were about the abnormal circumstances of normal people . I read the first headline I saw : " Seagulls Attack Lighthouse Keeper . " He asked me to read the next one : " Man Receives Letter Forty-Two Years After It Was Mailed . " He liked that one and asked me to read the article . It was a small piece about a man in Dearborn , Michigan , who had received a letter more than four decades after it was mailed by the sender , a woman who was now long dead and buried . The mailman dropped it off in the box with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though it belonged with them . At first the man thought it was an invitation to a wedding , the writing was so overwrought and ornate . The envelope , once white , had faded to faint pink . The stamp had lost all purchase on the surface of the envelope and now bled into it like a stain . It was a love letter . The article did a quick overview of the contents : how it started out " Donald my love , " how the writer was on a trip with her sister to New York City , how the weather that day in 1952 was dreadful , how she had taken refuge in a laundromat to write to him . The end of the letter-that she would be back , that he should wait-turned out to be untrue . In fact , according to the man who got the letter after the four-decade delay , she married another man a few months later . The man from Dearborn , still living at the same address in what was once his parents ' house , never married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think ? " Paul said . <p> " I 'll find a happy one . " And I did .

" Paul faced me the way a sighted person faces you when he 's studying your face . " Do you know what time it is ? " <p> " It 's eleven thirty . " <p> " It 's eleven thirty ? Now ? Right now it 's eleven thirty ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " All right , " he said , as though he was accepting some piece of news he did n't want to acknowledge . He licked his lips . " My mouth is dry . Can you hand me that glass of juice ? " He drank it down in loud gulps . When he tilted his head back , I saw all the loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Yes ? " <p> " What 's the weather like today ?

" <p> " The last reader , the one before your wife , took me for a ride once . Her car was white , she said . People with white cars drive very slowly . We did a circle and came back . I think having me in the car frightened her . " <p> He asked me to get a thin maroon cardigan sweater from his closet and help him get into it . <p> " Will you take me out for a drive , David ? " <p> I led him out of the building . He gripped my arm as we slowly walked down the gravel walkway and headed across the parking lot toward my car , which I had parked at the back in order not to take anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have trouble walking or whatever , park closer . He said , " You 're very tall . " It almost seemed to surprise him , as though he had another image of me . Once he got in the car , I pulled the seat belt around him and after a bit of fumbling engaged the buckle . Window up or down ? " Down , " he said . As we pulled out of the parking lot , I found a radio station playing classical music , a violin concerto . He kept taking deep breaths , getting as much of the fresh air as he could with each intake . I 'm not sure why , but I started to describe the scenery to him . On his side , I said , were trees in full leaf that stood above outcroppings of rock , and on mine some brown-and-white cows lying in a fenced-in field , and above , in the sky , a gathering of clouds , white , feathery , no hint of rain . We passed some bluebells growing wild beneath a stone wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still in skeletal form , lined up in a curving row . A boy was coming up a side street on a red bicycle . I remember feeling this sense of power that I could create the world for someone just by telling him what I saw . That is a very powerful thing if you 've never experienced it for yourself . Then I stopped talking . The road stretched out , and as we gained speed I looked over and saw Paul with this wide crooked smile on his face , caught in that moment and only that , heading straight into an indescribable horizon . <p> Author Affiliation
