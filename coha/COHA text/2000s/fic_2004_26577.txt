Blue Blood A Debutante Dropout Mystery Chapter One Music played in the background , a soft tinkling of piano keys that filtered into the yellow-walled dining room at the Palm , a swanky restaurant with white linen tablecloths , pricey lobster and steak , and an even more expensive clientele that Mother had selected for what she 'd told me was a " girls ' night out . " Ha . I could swear the tune that teased my ears was " Mack the Knife , " a fitting soundtrack for the murderous thoughts running through my head , though I could hardly hear the notes over the careful rise of her voice . " Did I tell you , Andrea , that Trey has a Ph.D . in philosophy from Southern Methodist ? " Cissy drawled above the hum of surrounding conversation , laying a smile so thick on Haskell E. Maxwell III that he blushed and nearly fogged up his Coke-bottle lenses . " Hmmm , " I turned away from Mr. Maxwell entirely to plant a glare on my mother that could 've set her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of it , I do n't believe you told me anything at all about Trey . " She fluttered her eyes , playing innocent . Badly . " Oh , did n't I ? Just an oversight , darling , I swear . " I swore as well . At her , under my breath . Her " oversight " had started with a lie about dinner this evening  --  " Oh , it 'll be fun , Andrea , just us girls at the Palm , what do you say ? "  --  never letting on for a moment that  --  surprise !  --  our reservation would include a mnage Trey , as it were . A blind date for moi . My prospective match , not surprisingly , was the son of a bosom buddy of Mother 's . He was nearly forty , rather gawky ( I 'm being kind ) , and never married , which might be a chronic problem for him if what I 'd seen so far was any indication . " He 's a musician , you know . " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long face , drooping hair , and geeky specs with black rims . Did he secretly wield a Fender Stratocaster for a rock band when he was n't off philosophizing ? For a moment , he almost seemed interesting . Until Mother answered , just a tad too brightly , " He happens to be a brilliant pipe organist . " My eyebrow fell , along with any spark of intrigue that had flared at the idea of Haskell III as a closet Rolling Stone . " It 's a difficult instrument , Andrea , sweetie , one that requires years of study . Trey is nothing if not dedicated , and that 's such a rare quality in men of your generation . " She put the hard sell on me , like a Mary Kay cosmetics lady just a lipstick shy of a pink Cadillac . " Did I tell you he played the most breathtaking rendition of ' Ave Maria ' at Highland Park Presby last Christmas ? " Cissy clasped a beautifully manicured hand to her silk-covered heart at the memory , drawing my eye to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found myself wondering how tightly I 'd have to pull them to cut off her oxygen . " Please , Mrs. Kendricks , you 're embarrassing me , " Trey feebly protested , and I wondered how a man who 'd grown up on a Texas cattle ranch the size of Rhode Island could be so meek and pale . Someone obviously had n't eaten his Wheaties . " A doctor of philosophy who plays the pipe organ . How ... unusual . " I glanced at the bespectacled buttoned-down fellow across the table without a drop of my mother 's enthusiasm , all the while thinking that a Ph.D . in basket weaving might have been handier . But , then again , Trey had a trust fund that could pay off the federal deficit , so employment probably was n't his biggest concern . " And he 's a member of Mensa , if that is n't enough . " " Oh , it 's enough already , " I murmured and felt the pointed toe of a Prada pump poke me in the shin . Cissy Blevins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with a guy who thought he was smarter than everyone else , played the organ ( which does n't sound like a good thing any way you put it ) , and who could quote Plato ad nauseam . Perfect . He fit right in with all the others she tried to foist on me when I least expected it . Last month it was an investment banker who wore a black eye patch but " had an impeccable nose for IPOs " and collected Lladro figurines . The month before , it was the heir to an ostrich farm whose long neck , receding hairline , beaked schnozz , and supersized Adam 's apple lent him a striking resemblance to his feathered beasts . Though I was the one who 'd wanted to bury my head in the sand . I wished my mother could just let me be . It 's not as if I were an old maid or anything , at least from my perspective . I was still on the sunny side of thirty and not desperate enough to settle for money instead of love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart . Any son of Ross Perot would do , even if that meant her grandchildren would have Dumbo ears and a squeaky drawl that made nails on a chalkboard sound pleasant in comparison . Trying to change her mind was a hopeless cause . Sort of like investing in Enron while they were making packing material out of financial reports . Part of me wondered why I had n't stayed in Chicago instead of coming home again , though I 'd felt so guilty for leaving Mother alone and going off to art school after Daddy died that I 'd nearly succumbed way back then and remained in Dallas to attend SMU . Cissy had her diamond-studded arrow badge ready to pin on me , expecting I 'd go through sorority rush and pledge Pi Phi , as she did . But my father had always insisted I follow my dreams ...
