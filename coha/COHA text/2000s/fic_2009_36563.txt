There were great advantages to being unimportant . <p> True , by many people 's standards , Siri was n't " unimportant . " She was , after all , the daughter of a king . Fortunately , her father had four living children , and Siri  --  at seventeen years of age  --  was the youn gest . Fafen , the daughter just older than Siri , had done the family duty and become a monk . Above Fafen was Ridger , the eldest son . He would inherit the throne . <p> And then there was Vivenna . Siri sighed as she walked down the path back to the city . Vivenna , the firstborn , was . . . well . . . Vivenna . Beautiful , poised , perfect in most every way . It was a good thing , too , considering the fact that she was betrothed to a god . Either way , Siri  --  as fourth child  --  was redundant . Vivenna and Ridger had to focus on their studies ; Fafen had to do her work in the pastures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with being unimportant . That meant she could disappear into the wilderness for hours at a time . <p> People would notice , of course , and she would get into trouble . Yet even her father would have to admit that her disappearance had n't caused much inconvenience . The city got along just fine without Siri  --  in fact , it tended to do a little better when she was n't around . <p> Unimportance . To another , it might have been offensive . To Siri it was a blessing . She smiled , walking into the city proper . She drew the inevitable stares . While Bevalis was technically the capital of Idris , it was n't that big , and everyone knew her by sight . Judging by the stories Siri had heard from passing ramblemen , her home was hardly even a village compared with the massive metropolises in other nations . <p> She liked it the way it was , even with the muddy streets , the thatched cottages , and the boring  --  yet sturdy  --  stone walls . Women chasing runaway geese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children leading sheep on their way to pasture . A grand city in Xaka , Hudres , or even terrible Hallandren might have exotic sights , but it would be crowded with faceless , shouting , jostling crowds , and haughty noblemen . Not Siri 's preference ; she generally found even Bevalis to be a bit busy for her . <p> Still , she thought , looking down at her utilitarian grey dress , I 'll bet those cities have more colors . That 's something I might like to see . <p> Her hair would n't stand out so much there . As usual , the long locks had gone blond with joy while she 'd been out in the fields . She concentrated , trying to rein them in , but she was only able to bring the color to a dull brown . As soon as she stopped focusing , her hair just went back to the way it had been . She 'd never been very good at controlling it . Not like Vivenna . <p> As she continued through the town , a group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ignore the children until one of them was brave enough to run forward and tug on her dress . Then she turned , smiling . They regarded her with solemn faces . Idris children were trained even at this age to avoid shameful outbursts of emotion . Austrin teachings said there was nothing wrong with feelings , but drawing attention to yourself with them was wrong . <p> Siri had never been very devout . It was n't her fault , she reasoned , if Austre had made her with a distinct inability to obey . The children waited patiently until Siri reached into her apron and pulled out a couple of brightly colored flowers . The children 's eyes opened wide , gazing at the vibrant colors . Three of the flowers were blue , one yellow . <p> The flowers stood out starkly against the town 's determined drabness . Other than what one could find in the skin and eyes of the people , there was n't a drop of color in sight . Stones had been whitewashed , clothing bleached grey or tan . All to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there could be no Awakeners . <p> The girl who had tugged Siri 's skirt finally took the flowers in one hand and dashed away with them , the other children following behind . Siri caught a look of disproval in the eyes of several passing villagers . None of them confronted her , though . Being a princess  --  even an unimportant one  --  did have its perks . <p> She continued on toward the palace . It was a low , single- story building with a large , packed- earth courtyard . Siri avoided the crowds of haggling people at the front , rounding to the back and going in the kitchen entrance . Mab , the kitchen mistress , stopped singing as the door opened , then eyed Siri . <p> " Your father 's been looking for you , child , " Mab said , turning away and humming as she attacked a pile of onions . <p> " I suspect that he has . " Siri walked over and sniffed at a pot , which bore the calm scent of boiling potatoes . <p> " Went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your tutorial sessions , I 'll bet . " <p> Siri smiled , then pulled out another of the bright yellow flowers , spinning it between two fingers . <p> Mab rolled her eyes . " And been corrupting the city youth again , I suspect . Honestly , girl , you should be beyond these things at your age . Your father will have words with you about shirking your responsibilities . " <p> " I like words , " Siri said . " And I always learn a few new ones when Father gets angry . I should n't neglect my education , now should I ? " <p> Mab snorted , dicing some pickled cucumbers into the onions . <p> " Honestly , Mab , " Siri said , twirling the flower , feeling her hair shade a little bit red . " I do n't see what the problem is . Austre made the flowers , right ? He put the colors on them , so they ca n't be evil . I mean , we call him God of Colors , for heaven 's sake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , adding something that looked like grass to her concoction , " assuming they 're left where Austre put them . We should n't use Austre 's beauty to make ourselves more important . " <p> " A flower does n't make me look more important . " <p> " Oh ? " Mab asked , adding the grass , cucumber , and onions to one of her boiling pots . She banged the side of the pot with the flat of her knife , listening , then nodded to herself and began fishing under the counter for more vegetables . " You tell me , " she continued , voice muffled . " You really think walking through the city with a flower like that did n't draw attention to yourself ? " <p> " That 's only because the city is so drab . If there were a bit of color around , nobody would notice a flower . " <p> Mab reappeared , hefting a box filled with various tubers . " You 'd have us decorate the place like Hallandren ? Maybe we should start inviting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Some dev il sucking the souls out of children , strangling people with their own clothing ? Bringing men back from the grave , then using their dead bodies for cheap labor ? Sacrificing women on their unholy altars ? " <p> Siri felt her hair whiten slightly with anxiety . Stop that ! she thought . The hair seemed to have a mind of its own , responding to gut feelings . <p> " That sacrificing-maidens part is only a story , " Siri said . " They do n't really do that . " <p> " Stories come from somewhere . " <p> " Yes , they come from old women sitting by the hearth in the winter . I do n't think we need to be so frightened . The Hallandren will do what they want , which is fine by me , as long as they leave us alone . " <p> Mab chopped tubers , not looking up . <p> " We 've got the treaty , Mab , " Siri said . " Father and Vivenna will make sure we 're safe , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " And if they do n't ? " <p> " They will . You do n't need to worry . " <p> " They have better armies , " Mab said , chopping , not looking up , " better steel , more food , and those . . . those things . It makes people worry . Maybe not you , but sensible folk . " <p> The cook 's words were hard to dismiss out of hand . Mab had a sense , a wisdom beyond her instinct for spices and broths . However , she also tended to fret . " You 're worrying about nothing , Mab . You 'll see . " <p> " I 'm just saying that this is a bad time for a royal princess to be running around with flowers , standin ' out and inviting Austre 's dislike . " <p> Siri sighed . " Fine , then , " she said , tossing her last flower into the stewpot . " Now we can all stand out together . " <p> Mab froze , then rolled her eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanavel flower ? " <p> " Of course , " Siri said , sniffing at the steaming pot . " I know better than to ruin a good stew . And I still say you 're overreacting . " <p> Mab sniffed . " Here , " she said , pulling out another knife . " Make yourself useful . There 's roots that need choppin ' . " <p> " Should n't I report to my father ? " Siri said , grabbing a gnarled vanavel root and beginning to chop . <p> " He 'll just send you back here and make you work in the kitchens as a punishment , " Mab said , banging the pot with her knife again . She firmly believed that she could judge when a dish was done by the way the pot rang . <p> " Austre help me if Father ever discovers I like it down here . " <p> " You just like being close to the food , " Mab said , fishing Siri 's flower out of the stew then tossing it aside . " Either way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in conference with Yarda . " <p> Siri gave no reaction  --  she simply continued to chop . Her hair , however , grew blond with excitement . Father 's conferences with Yarda usually last hours , she thought . Not much point in simply sitting around , waiting for him to get done .... <p> Mab turned to get something off the table , and by the time she looked back , Siri had bolted out the door and was on her way toward the royal stables . Bare minutes later , she galloped away from the palace , wearing her favorite brown cloak , feeling an exhilarated thrill that sent her hair into a deep blond . A nice quick ride would be a good way to round out the day . <p> After all , her punishment was likely to be the same either way . <p> DEDELIN , KING OF IDRIS , set the letter down on his desk . He had stared at it long enough . It was time to decide whether or not to send his eldest daughter to her death . <p> Despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warmth was a rare thing in the Idris highlands ; it was coveted and enjoyed , for it lingered only briefly each summer . The chambers were also stark . There was a beauty in simplicity . Even a king had no right to display arrogance by ostentation . <p> Dedelin stood up , looking out his window and into the courtyard . The palace was small by the world 's standards  --  only a single story high , with a peaked wooden roof and squat stone walls . But it was large by Idris standards , and it bordered on flamboyant . This could be forgiven , for the palace was also a meeting hall and center of operations for his entire kingdom . <p> The king could see General Yarda out of the corner of his eye . The burly man stood waiting , his hands clasped behind his back , his thick beard tied in three places . He was the only other person in the room . <p> Dedelin glanced back at the letter . The paper was a bright pink , and the garish color stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snow . Pink was a color one would never see in Idris . In Hallandren , however  --  center of the world 's dye industry  --  such tasteless hues were commonplace . <p> " Well , old friend ? " Dedelin asked . " Do you have any advice for me ? " <p> General Yarda shook his head . " War is coming , Your Majesty . I feel it in the winds and read it in the reports of our spies . Hallandren still considers us rebels , and our passes to the north are too tempting . They will attack . " <p> " Then I should n't send her , " Dedelin said , looking back out his window . The courtyard bustled with people in furs and cloaks coming to market . <p> " We ca n't stop the war , Your Majesty , " Yarda said . " But . . . we can slow it . " <p> Dedelin turned back . <p> Yarda stepped forward , speaking softly . " This is not a good time . Our troops still have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fires in the granary this winter ... " Yarda shook his head . " We can not afford to get into a defensive war in the summer . Our best ally against the Hallandren are the snows . We ca n't let this conflict occur on their terms . If we do , we are dead . " <p> The words all made sense . <p> " Your Majesty , " Yarda said , " they are waiting for us to break the treaty as an excuse to attack . If we move first , they will strike . " <p> " If we keep the treaty , they will still strike , " Dedelin said . <p> " But later . Perhaps months later . You know how slow Hallandren politics are . If we keep the treaty , there will be debates and arguments . If those last until the snows , then we will have gained the time we need so badly . " <p> It all made sense . Brutal , honest sense . All these years , Dedelin had stalled and watched as the Hallandren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agitated . Every year , voices called for an assault on the " rebel Idrians " living up in the highlands . Every year , those voices grew louder and more plentiful . Every year , Dedelin 's placating and politics kept the armies away . He had hoped , perhaps , that the rebel leader Vahr and his Pahn Kahl dissidents would draw attention away from Idris , but Vahr had been captured , his so- called army dispersed . His actions had only served to make Hallandren more focused on its enemies . <p> The peace would not last . Not with Idris ripe , not with the trade routes worth so much . Not with the current crop of Hallandren gods , who seemed so much more erratic than their pre de cessors . He knew all of that . But he also knew that breaking the treaty would be foolish . When you were cast into the den of a beast , you did not provoke it to anger . <p> Yarda joined him beside the window , looking out , leaning one elbow against the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of harsh winters . But he was also as good a man as Dedelin had ever known  --  a part of the king longed to marry Vivenna to the general 's own son . <p> That was foolishness . Dedelin had always known this day would come . He 'd crafted the treaty himself , and it demanded he send his daughter to marry the God King . The Hallandren needed a daughter of the royal blood to reintroduce the traditional bloodline into their monarchy . It was something the depraved and vainglorious people of the lowlands had long coveted , and only that specific clause in the treaty had saved Idris these twenty years . <p> That treaty had been the first official act of Dedelin 's reign , negotiated furiously following his father 's assassination . Dedelin gritted his teeth . How quickly he 'd bowed before the whims of his enemies . Yet he would do it again ; an Idris monarch would do anything for his people . That was one big difference between Idris and Hallandren . <p> " If we send her , Yarda , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . " <p> " Maybe they wo n't harm her , " Yarda finally said . <p> " You know better than that . The first thing they 'll do when war comes is use her against me . This is Hallandren . They invite Awakeners into their palaces , for Austre 's sake ! " <p> Yarda fell silent . Finally , he shook his head . " Latest reports say their army has grown to include some forty thousand Lifeless . " <p> Lord God of Colors , Dedelin thought , glancing at the letter again . Its language was simple . Vivenna 's twenty- second birthday had come , and the terms of the treaty stipulated that Dedelin could wait no longer . <p> " Sending Vivenna is a poor plan , but it 's our only plan , " Yarda said . " With more time , I know I can bring the Tedradel to our cause  --  they 've hated Hallandren since the Manywar . And perhaps I can find a way to rile Vahr 's broken rebel faction in Hallandren itself . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live another year . " Yarda turned to him . " If we do n't send the Hallandren their princess , the war will be seen as our fault . Who will support us ? They will demand to know why we refused to follow the treaty our own king wrote ! " <p> " And if we do send them Vivenna , it will introduce the royal blood into their monarchy , and that will have an even more legitimate claim on the highlands ! " <p> " Perhaps , " Yarda said . " But if we both know they 're going to attack anyway , then what do we care about their claim ? At least this way , perhaps they will wait until an heir is born before the assault comes . " <p> More time . The general always asked for more time . But what about when that time came at the cost of Dedelin 's own child ? <p> Yarda would n't hesitate to send one soldier to die if it would mean time enough to get the rest of his troops into better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How can I ask anything less of my daughter than I 'd demand of one of my troops ? <p> It was just that thinking of Vivenna in the God King 's arms , being forced to bear that creature 's child ... it nearly made his hair bleach with concern . That child would become a stillborn monster who would become the next Returned god of the Hallandren . <p> There is another way , a part of his mind whispered . You do n't have to send Vivenna .... <p> A knock came at his door . Both he and Yarda turned , and Dedelin called for the visitor to enter . He should have been able to guess whom it would be . <p> Vivenna stood in a quiet grey dress , looking so young to him still . Yet she was the perfect image of an Idris woman  --  hair kept in a modest knot , no makeup to draw attention to the face . She was not timid or soft , like some noblewomen from the northern kingdoms . She was just composed . Composed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " You have been in here for several hours , Father , " Vivenna said , bowing her head respectfully to Yarda . " The servants speak of a colorful envelope carried by the general when he entered . I believe I know what it contained . " <p> Dedelin met her eyes , then waved for her to seat herself . She softly closed the door , then took one of the wooden chairs from the side of the room . Yarda remained standing , after the masculine fashion . Vivenna eyed the letter sitting on the desk . She was calm , her hair controlled and kept a respectful black . She was twice as devout as Dedelin , and  --  unlike her youn gest sister  --  she never drew attention to herself with fits of emotion . <p> " I assume that I should prepare myself for departure , then , " Vivenna said , hands in her lap . <p> Dedelin opened his mouth , but could find no objection . He glanced at Yarda , who just shook his head , resigned . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Vivenna said . " I am ready . Siri , however , will not take this well . She left on a ride an hour ago . I should depart the city before she gets back . That will avoid any potential scene she might make . " <p> " Too late , " Yarda said , grimacing and nodding toward the window . Just outside , people scattered in the courtyard as a figure galloped through the gates . She wore a deep brown cloak that bordered on being too colorful , and  --  of course  --  she had her hair down . <p> The hair was yellow . <p> Dedelin felt his rage and frustration growing . Only Siri could make him lose control , and  --  as if in ironic counterpoint to the source of his anger  --  he felt his hair change . To those watching , a few locks of hair on his head would have bled from black to red . It was the identifying mark of the royal family , who had fled to the Idris highlands at the climax of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , manifested what they felt in the very hair on their heads . <p> Vivenna watched him , pristine as always , and her poise gave him strength as he forced his hair to turn black again . It took more willpower than any common man could understand to control the treasonous Royal Locks . Dedelin was n't sure how Vivenna managed it so well . <p> Poor girl never even had a childhood , he thought . From birth , Vivenna 's life had been pointed toward this single event . His firstborn child , the girl who had always seemed like a part of himself . The girl who had always made him proud ; the woman who had already earned the love and respect of her people . In his mind 's eye he saw the queen she could become , stronger even than he . Someone who could guide them through the dark days ahead . <p> But only if she survived that long . <p> " I will prepare myself for the trip , " Vivenna said , rising . <p> " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Father , " Vivenna said . " If we break this treaty , it will mean war . I am prepared to sacrifice for our people . You taught me that . " <p> " You will not go , " Dedelin said firmly , turning back toward the window . Outside , Siri was laughing with one of the stablemen . Dedelin could hear her outburst even from a distance ; her hair had turned a flame- colored red . <p> Lord God of Colors , forgive me , he thought . What a terrible choice for a father to make . The treaty is specific : I must send the Hallandren my daughter when Vivenna reaches her twenty- second birthday . But it does n't actually say which daughter I am required to send . <p> If he did n't send Hallandren one of his daughters , they would attack immediately . If he sent the wrong one , they might be angered , but he knew they would n't attack . They would wait until they had an heir . That would gain Idris at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If they were to try to use Vivenna against me , I know that I would n't be able to stop myself from giving in . It was shameful to admit that fact , but in the end , it was what made the decision for him . <p> Dedelin turned back toward the room . " Vivenna , you will not go to wed the tyrant god of our enemies . I 'm sending Siri in your place .
