Man walks into doctor 's office . Doctor says , I 've got terrible news for you : you 're suffering from terminal cancer . Also , you have amnesia . Man says , Hey , at least I do n't have cancer ! <P> Amnesia is one of those rare mental conditions  --  like narcissism  --  that it 's O.K. to make fun of . Maybe that 's why it 's such a favorite among screenwriters : since Christmas , we have had no fewer than three movies that revolve around people misplacing their memories . In Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind , Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet pay to have the memory of their lousy relationship erased . Paycheck was a sci-fi thriller about a man ( Ben Affleck ) whose employers wipe his memory for security purposes . ( As an extra precaution , they then erased Paycheck from the memory of the entire moviegoing public . ) And in 50 First Dates , Drew Barrymore plays a woman with amnesia who is endlessly wooed and rewooed by Adam Sandler . Apparently she forgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> And that 's not all . There 's an amnesia epidemic raging at the box office : Memento , The Bourne Identity , Finding Nemo , Vanilla Sky , The Man Without a Past , the entire Matrix trilogy ; and do n't forget that Carrey forgot who he was once before in The Majestic . Why the obsession with absentmindedness ? This is n't just a handy screenwriting device . There 's something going on here , somewhere down in the zeitgeist-haunted basement of popular culture where our national subconscious lives . Why ca n't the great American movie hero remember who he is ? <P> In Eternal Sunshine , Carrey and Winslet are Joel and Clem , two sad sacks trapped in a dead-end , no-hope , kill-me-now love affair in small-town Long Island , N.Y . They ca n't stand each other , and they ca n't break up . Out of desperation Clem undergoes a medical procedure that wipes all traces of Joel from her memory . When Joel finds out about it , he goes to the same doctor to have Clem erased too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an existential head scratcher , an endless M.C. Escher escalator . Who 's to say the doomed lovers have n't fallen in love and broken up before ? Maybe they 've loved and lost a hundred times before , like the last damn level of a video game they ca n't beat ? The possibility opens up bottomless gulfs of self-doubt . If our minds are as rippable , mixable and burnable as an M , how can we ever be sure we know who we are ? <P> There 's something profoundly sinister and infectious about the idea , and it 's a virus we caught from our computers . We spend all day working in a ghost world of digital data , computerized information that 's manipulable , rewritable , copyable , rebootable and erasable . Then we go home to a computer full of MP3s and a TiVo full of reruns . Eternal Sunshine plays on the creeping suspicion that our memories might work the same way  --  that deep down we 're not unique immortal souls but swirls of fungible data points on a rewritable hard drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is information , and information is infinitely malleable , how can we be sure it has n't been corrupted ? What if we all have amnesia , and we 've just forgotten that we have it ? Joel is a new kind of hero : he 's not struggling with somebody else or with himself . He 's fighting for the idea that there 's a " he " to fight in the first place , and in the end it 's not at all clear that he wins . Existential certainty ? Fuhgeddaboutit.
