LaGuardia Airport Concourse C Gate 21 <p> The dark glasses did n't hide a thing , not really . When people saw someone in dark glasses on a cloudy day in the middle of winter , they assumed the wearer was hiding the fact that she 'd been drinking , crying or fighting . <p> Or all of the above . <p> Under any number of circumstances , Kimberly van Dorn enjoyed being the center of attention . Last night , when she 'd donned her couture gown with its scandalous slit up the side , turning heads had been the whole idea . She 'd had no idea the evening would implode the way it had . How could she ? <p> Now , at the end of a soul-flattening red-eye flight , she kept her shades on as the plane touched down and taxied to the Jetway . Coach . She never flew coach . Last night , however , first class had been sold out , personal comfort had taken a back seat to expediency , and she 'd found herself in seat 29-E in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedged between strangers . Sometimes the need to get away was more powerful than the need for legroom . Although her stiff legs this morning might argue that point . <p> Who the hell had designed coach class , anyway ? She was convinced she had the imprint of her seatmate 's ear on her shoulder . After his fourth beer , he kept falling asleep , his head lolling onto her . What was worse than a man with a lolling head ? <p> A man with a lolling head and beer breath , she thought grimly , trying to shake off the torturous transcontinental night . But the memories lingered like the ache in her legs  --  the lolling guy with a snoring problem , and , on her other side , an impossibly chatty older gentleman , who talked for hours about his insomnia . And his bursitis . And his lousy son-in-law , his fondness for fried sweet potatoes and his dislike of the Jude Law movie Kim was pretending to watch in hopes of getting him to shut up . <p> No wonder she never flew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing that had happened to her lately . Far from it . <p> She stood in the aisle , waiting for the twenty-eight rows ahead of her to deplane . The process seemed endless as people rummaged in the overhead bins , gathering their things while talking on mobile phones . <p> She took out her phone , thumb hovering over the power button . She really ought to call her mother , let her know she was coming home . Not now , though , she thought , putting the phone away . She was too exhausted to make any sense . Besides , for all she knew , the thing had one of those tracking features , and she did n't feel like being tracked . <p> Now that she 'd arrived , she was n't in such a big hurry . In fact , she was utterly unprepared to face a dreary midwinter morning in New York . Ignoring the stares of other passengers , she tried to act as though traveling in an evening gown was a routine occurrence for her , and hoped people would just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If only it could be that simple . <p> Shuffling along the narrow aisle of the coach section , she definitely felt like a victim . In more ways than one . <p> She left behind a scattering of sequins in the aisle . There was a reason clothes like this were designated as " evening wear . " The silk charmeuse dress , encrusted with sequins , was meant to be worn in the romantic semidarkness of a candlelit private club or southern California garden , lit by tiki torches . Not in the broad , unforgiving daylight of a Saturday morning . <p> It was funny , she thought , how even a couture gown from Shantung on Rodeo Drive managed to look tawdry in the morning light . Especially when combined with a side slit , bare legs and peep-toe spike heels with a crisscross ankle strap . Only last night , every detail had whispered class . Now her outfit screamed hooker . No wonder she was getting funny looks . <p> But last night , in the middle of everything , Kim had n't been thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting away . It seemed as though a million years had passed since then , since she 'd dressed so carefully , so filled with hope and optimism . Lloyd Johnson , star of the Lakers and the biggest client of the PR firm she worked for , was at the pinnacle of his career . More importantly for Kimberly , he 'd found his dream house in Manhattan Beach . They planned to live there together . It was supposed to be her night , a moment of triumph , maybe even a life-changing occasion if Lloyd had decided to pop the question . Well , it had been life-changing , just not in the way she 'd anticipated . She had sunk everything she had into her career as a sports publicist . And overnight , that had crumbled . She was Jerry Maguire without the triumphant ending . <p> She finally reached the front of the aircraft , murmuring a thank-you to the flight attendants as she passed . It was n't their fault the flight had been so miserable , and they 'd been up all night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jetway , the security doors opened and a ground-crew guy in a jumpsuit and earphones blew in on a gust of frigid wind . <p> The arctic air slapped her like a physical assault , tearing at the silk dress and skimming over her bare legs . She gasped aloud and gathered a fringed wrap  --  the only outerwear she had  --  around her bare shoulders , clutching it in one fist , her jewel-encrusted peacock evening bag in the other . <p> Sweet , merciful Lord . She had forgotten this  --  the East Coast cold that simply had no rival anywhere in California . She grabbed her long red hair but was too late . It had already been blown into a terrifying bouffant , and she was fairly sure she 'd lost an earring . Lovely . <p> Holding her head high , she emerged from the Jetway and entered the terminal , walking at a normal , unhurried pace , though she wanted to collapse . The red-soled Louboutins with their three-inch heels , which had looked so fabulous with the single-shoulder sheath , now felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes and clutching the silk wrap around her , she scanned the concourse for an open shop to buy something to wear on the last leg of the trip , to the town of Avalon up in the Catskills , where her mother now lived . Last night , there had been no time to grab anything , even if she had been thinking straight . She 'd made the flight with moments to spare . <p> To her dismay , all the kiosks and shops along the way were still closed ; never had she craved a pair of flip-flops and an I ? NY T-shirt more . It was a long walk to the commuter concourse , especially in these heels . <p> She passed people in warm winter clothes , probably heading up to the mountains for a weekend of fun . She pretended not to notice the looks of speculation , the comments whispered behind snugly gloved hands . Ordinarily , other people 's opinions were her first concern . But not today . She was too tired to care what people were saying about her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his foot propped against the wall , staring at her . Okay , so a lot of guys were staring at her , since she was dressed like an escapee from a Hooters convention . He was easily six foot five and had long hair , and he wore cargo pants and an army surplus parka with wolf fur around the hood . <p> She was an idiot for not being able to ignore him . Men were her downfall ; she should know better . And  --  please , Lord , no  --  with a leisurely air , he pushed away from the wall and seemed to be ambling toward her . Kim had never been much of a student of literature , but as he advanced on her , she found herself remembering a phrase coined by Dorothy Parker  --  What fresh hell is this ? <p> More quickly than was prudent in the skinny heels , she headed for the moving walkway , wishing it could be a magic carpet , whisking her away from her troubles . She stepped aboard  --  and felt one of her heels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her teeth , she tried to tug her foot free . As she did so , the other heel sank into another groove . <p> And just when she thought the day could not get any worse , it did . <p> Bo Crutcher sized up the redhead in the high heels at the gate across the way . She 'd arrived on the red-eye from L.A. He was waiting for a different arrival , a red-eye from Houston . The sign over the gate was flashing Delayed . <p> The L.A. redhead was exactly his type  --  tall and slender , amazing hair and big tits , slutty clothes . He loved that in a woman . She was glaring daggers at him , but since he had time to kill , he welcomed any distraction . She was all of Bo 's favorite things in one package  --  tequila shots and Dreamsicles , Stanley Clarke riffs and the most perfect throw of a baseball , the one that could never be touched by any batter ever born . She had one of the world 's perfect asses and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> At the moment , he had no business checking her out , but she was hard to ignore . He studied her the way an art afficionado might check out a painting of Botticelli 's Venus . Bo had never understood how an artist could sit there and paint a picture of a naked woman . How the hell could the guy concentrate in the presence of a nude model ? <p> As though attuned to his inappropriate thoughts , the redhead sped toward the moving sidewalk in the middle of the concourse , her heels clicking with disapproval . <p> And Bo was left to remember his purpose . This was not the way he had planned to spend his weekend . He should be home , sleeping off a big night at the Hilltop Tavern . Torres had fought Bledsoe in the match of the year , and Bo had ponied up a thousand bucks for a satellite feed to the bar . He 'd anticipated staying up late , drawing beer after beer for the patrons and friends , cheering for the underdog on the 60-inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn the wrath of his boss , Maggie Lynn . It was shaping up to be a damn fine night , any way you looked at it . <p> Except it had n't gone that way . His plans fell apart when he checked his voice mail , receiving the most unexpected phone call of his life . At that point , he 'd been obliged to drop everything and drive as fast as he dared from Avalon , deep in the Catskills , down to New York City in order to meet the flight from Houston . <p> Now , standing at Gate 22-C in the terminal , he was sweating bullets made of grade-A panic . And he had another half hour to kill . He glanced around , focused again on the redhead , now gliding away on the automatic sidewalk . She seemed to be having a little trouble with her shoes , though . She was bent over , apparently trying to unbuckle the straps . <p> Realizing she was stuck , he hurried over , stepped aboard the walkway and sprinted to her side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ma'am , " he said . <p> She continued struggling with the strap of her high heel . Not one but both heels appeared to be stuck . He looked around wildly for a moment , seeking an emergency switch . Seeing nothing , he bent down , put his hand around one of her ankles and yanked her foot free . She gave a yelp of surprise and panic . <p> " Get away from me , " she said . " I mean it , back off  --  " <p> " In a minute . " The other shoe would n't give , and they 'd nearly reached the end of the walkway . She was risking serious injury now . He gave her foot a final tug , freeing it with a lurch and the distinct sound of tearing fabric . He grabbed her to keep her from falling , lifting her off her feet as he strode to the end of the walkway . He stepped off , with his arms full of pissed-off redhead . He set her down and backed off , holding up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm . <p> He should have known better than to expect gratitude . Should have let her fall on her ass or get sucked through the conveyer belt like a cartoon character . Still , he could n't help but notice she had a face like a goddess in a museum sculpture . He wondered what color her eyes were behind the sunglasses . <p> Then he spotted her small , fancy handbag on the floor and stooped to pick it up , a fresh chance at chivalry . <p> " Ma'am . " With a small flourish , he handed her the bag . " Nice peacock , " he said . " She has no peer , that Judith Leiber . " <p> The comment seemed to further disorient her . It always surprised women when he showed off his knowledge of designers . Some assumed he was queer . What it really meant was that he loved women and studied their likes and dislikes with the thoroughness of a cultural anthropologist . <p> The redhead snatched the purse from him . <p> " Can I buy you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , open for business and plenty busy despite the ungodly hour . <p> She stared at him as if he had frogs coming out of his mouth . " Certainly not . " <p> " Just thought I 'd ask . " He kept his smile in place . Sometimes they played hard to get to make sure he meant business . " Rough night ? " <p> A small , tight smile curved her very pretty mouth . " I 'm sorry , " she said , " but clearly you 've mistaken me for someone else . " She spoke with a precise , prep-school diction he found sexy . " Someone who has the slightest bit of interest in talking to you . " With that , she turned and left , the torn seam of her dress offering him a glimpse of long , slender leg . <p> " You 're welcome , " he muttered , staring at her ass as she walked away . <p> Strike one , he thought . It was for the best , anyway . He was n't here for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> After the redhead disappeared at the end of the concourse , he was forced to deal with the reality of being here . He paced back and forth , eyeing the gate like a gladiator awaiting an onslaught of hungry lions . The thick gray door was still firmly closed . He 'd already annoyed the gate agent by flashing his security pass and asking four different times when the flight would arrive . <p> He glanced at the clock . Still twenty minutes to go . <br> Continues ...
