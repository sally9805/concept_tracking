<p> Listen to Democrats and it is easy to say what they are not . <p> They are not the party that led America to war in Iraq . They are not the party trying to privatize Social Security , cut taxes to the rich or add to the deficit . They are not the party responsible for the slow federal response to Hurricane Katrina , whose top leaders in the House and Senate are under investigation , whose White House is being scrutinized by a special prosecutor , or whose members are up in arms over their president 's latest Supreme Court selection . <p> Democrats , some barely able to contain their glee , seem to have embraced the strategy of Napoleon Bonaparte , who famously advised : " Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake . " <p> It is far more difficult to say what Democrats are for . <p> Some call for a quick reduction of U.S. troops in Iraq ; others call for an increase . Most Democrats push for deficit reduction ; others push for more social spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' nomination to the Supreme Court came before the Senate , half the Democrats voted in favor and half the Democrats voted against . <p> Washington 's conventional wisdom places Democrats in a strong position to gain seats during next year 's congressional election , if for no other reason than the Republican Party 's political misfortunes , which show no signs of abating . White House Chief of Staff Karl Rove 's full morning of testimony before a Washington grand jury on Friday served as another reminder of potential problems ahead . <p> But for Democrats to capitalize on the GOP 's woes and win the 15 House seats or six Senate seats needed to claim a majority in either legislative body , most agree they need to put forward an appealing alternative of their own . <p> Republicans swept away half a century of Democratic domination of Congress in 1994 in large part by playing up their opponents ' failings . But they also presented a " Contract with America , " which provided sound-bite-sized themes  --  from lowering taxes to diminishing the role of government  --  to rally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elections into a national referendum on the status quo . <p> Democrats are searching for their own unifying themes , with strategists voicing concern that roughly one year before the election , many people have little idea what the party stands for . <p> Part of the problem stems from Democratic disagreements on specific issues , such as Iraq , as well as broader strategic decisions such as whether to concentrate on invigorating the base or reaching out to moderate swing voters . It is accentuated by the lack of a marquee leader who can stir members coast to coast , and by the party 's minority status , which deprives it of a platform to promote its agenda . <p> After consecutive losses in presidential elections and now in their second decade as a minority on Capitol Hill , Democrats are struggling for a well recognized identity . <p> " Democrats have found it difficult to articulate a compelling message or an alternative agenda , " wrote former Clinton White House aides Elaine Kamarck , now on the faculty at Harvard 's Kennedy School of Government , and William Galston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently released 68-page report titled " The Politics of Polarization . " <p> " Whatever voters may think of the Republican mantra  --  strong defense , lower taxes , traditional values  --  at least they know where Republicans stand . They have no such conviction about the Democrats , " concludes the report . <p> Or , put more bluntly by comedian Jay Leno as he marked the 33rd anniversary of the break-in at the Democratic Party 's headquarters at the Watergate office complex : " You see , back in those days the Democrats actually had ideas worth stealing . " <p> Republicans have fostered that perception by attacking Democrats for failing to specify their own plans on thorny matters like Iraq and Social Security . A typical GOP news release , distributed to reporters last week , labeled Democrats " The party of no plan , the party of no agenda . " <p> Seeking to change that perception , Democrats have embarked on a mission to make their unifying principles more recognizable . <p> Top Democrats on Capitol Hill , including House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting with mayors and governors to develop a cohesive strategy for the 2006 campaign , which would outline a set of core principles and broad policy goals . Pelosi stands to become House speaker , and Reid would be Senate majority leader , if Democrats could win back their majority in either house . <p> Democrats planned to release the initiatives next year , when voters become more focused on the election . The GOP 's Contract with America , for example , was released in the final six weeks of the 1994 campaign . But the GOP 's difficulties and plummeting poll numbers have prompted Democratic leaders to consider releasing their plan before Thanksgiving . <p> " The Republicans have opened the door so wide , we 've moved up our timetable , " said Pelosi spokeswoman Jennifer Crider . <p> A draft of Pelosi 's proposals includes eight platforms , including " Real Security for America , " " Quality and Affordable Health Care for all Americans , " and an " End to the Culture of Cronyism , Incompetence and Corruption in Washington . " <p> The specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops can leave Iraq , permitting re-importation of prescription drugs , raising the minimum wage , and making health insurance and college educations available to those who can not now afford them . <p> Democrats believe their political fortunes will rise as the election approaches . Potential indictments of high-ranking White House aides such as Rove , or Scooter Libby , Vice President Dick Cheney 's chief of staff , for their roles in leaking the name of a CIA agent to the news media , would embroil the Bush administration in its biggest legal scandal yet . And investigations into lobbyist Jack Abramoff could bring further trouble for Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas , who had to resign as Republican House majority leader after he was indicted for allegedly funneling corporate money into Texas legislative races . <p> While it is easy to bring Democrats together to denounce Rove and DeLay , it will be far more challenging for the party to reach consensus on matters such as Iraq or how to balance social spending with fiscal responsibility . <p> " It 's a long process to get risk-averse politicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Campaign for America 's Future , a liberal think tank and advocacy group based in Washington . <p> Borosage said the confluence of events allow Democrats to break the GOP 's hold over national politics if , and only if , they " make themselves a compelling force for change . " <p> As a matter of strategy , Kamarck and Galston argued the party must reach to the center , if only because there are more self-identified conservatives than there are liberals . If both sides turn out their base , they wrote , Republicans will win . They point out that in the 2004 election , Sen. John Kerry captured 54 percent of the " moderate " voters and still lost the election . By contrast , Bill Clinton captured more than 60 percent of the moderate vote in his two victories . <p> Many liberals , however , said the party must become more strident in its positions to better distinguish themselves from Republicans and enliven the party 's base . <p> The party 's schism on the matter was evident in the elevation of Howard Dean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many " blue-state " liberals , won the party 's confidence after pledging to commit himself to building up the party in more conservative " red states . " <p> For all the troubles Dean has confronted trying to build the Democrats ' image , he referred to the GOP 's difficulties last week during an appearance on the " Late Show with David Letterman , " saying : " My job just got a whole lot easier .
