Although ignorance is reputed to be bliss , I 'm more of a believer that knowledge is power-but not always when it comes to cycling . A couple of weeks ago I took a trip and only brought a mountain bike . So there I was on a road ride , chasing uphill on a 28-pound full  --  suspension mountain bike when I asked myself , " Why am I trying to keep up ? They 're on road bikes . " And with that realization , I backed off and let them go . Before that , I 'd been caught up in the fun of a good chase-and I 'd been closing on them like a cruise missile . I let the numbers get to me . Cycling is full of numbers . I 'm six-foot-one . I weigh 145 pounds ( on a good day ) . I have a 34-inch inseam , I ride a 59-cm road bike , a 19-inch mountain bike , 42 is my shoe size , my max heart rate is 216 beats per minute and 190 bpm is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These all matter , to some degree . But riding is n't about numbers . It 's about you and your bike . Our sport is technical . Science can help us discover how fast we can go  --  why else would pros like Lance Armstrong spend so much time in wind tunnels ? We 've all thrown our bikes on the scale and compared weights with our friends ' bikes . Have n't you ever charged up a hill with a buddy , then backed off because your pal 's bike weighed six pounds less than yours and that was too much of a handicap ? I know I have . Sometimes the numbers fall in your favor . I was once lucky enough to get run in a wind tunnel , and discovered that in a racing tuck my drag was almost as low as Greg LeMond 's . I came back from the wind tunnel a changed rider , reeling in guys who used to routinely ride me off their wheels . It had nothing to do with fitness ; knowing that I was aerodynamically superior , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is , we ca n't quantify everything about cycling . Yes , you can weigh your equipment , test yourself on an ergometer , read the wind and noodle over every aspect of performance . But unless you 're an Olympic-caliber athlete who can unfailingly hit 100% with all the precision and repeatability of a Formula 1 engine , your psyche is more influential than any measurement . You 've probably seen this in action yourself-you climb a hill faster than usual and look down at the top to discover you rode a gear higher than you thought . Or perhaps you 've borrowed a bike , gone faster than ever because it felt light and discovered afterwards it was two pounds heavier than your usual ride . Sometimes we 're faster because science says we are . But more often , the numbers do n't favor us  --  somebody 's always better on paper . Buy that ultralight bike or the aero wheels or the superslick skinsuit because it makes you feel good . Believe that it 'll make you a better rider , and it will . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convenient excuse . Garrett Lai , BICYCLING 's senior editor , demystifies and humanizes technology and equipment in this spot every month . <p>
