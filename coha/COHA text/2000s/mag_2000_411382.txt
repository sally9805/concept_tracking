// We test zero-to riding mowers . It 's no secret that Americans love their lawns . Not so cutting them , however . The average person wants to get that lawn mowed in a hurry and then get on to the next job or perhaps something fun . And even people who like to cut their lawns have their limits . This ambivalence-love the lawn but hate the cutting-has resulted in a demand for machines that cut grass efficiently and make fewer physical demands of the operator . Over the years , manufacturers have developed more efficient grass cutting machines , and the most recent expression of this is known loosely as a zero-turn mower . This is a machine that steers using the rear wheels and is far removed from the traditional front-wheel-steering tractor design of other products . We tested six of the most sophisticated zero-turn mowers designed for residential use and made some surprising discoveries along the way . The Zero Turn Trend The machines that we tested are direct descendants of the commercial cutting machines introduced several years ado . They are designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need to trim . One advantage of these machines is that they pivot through 180 without leaving a circle of uncut grass ( the radius or diameter of the uncut circle is one measure of a conventional mower 's cutting ability ) . The typical design of a zero-turn mower has each rear wheel connected to a hydrostatic transmission-a device that creates wheel rotation using pressurized fluid . Rotational force from the engine turns a pulley-operated pump that pressurizes the transmission fluid . When you move a steering/speed lever , you are controlling the flow of fluid through the transmission and the rotational speed or the forward/reverse direction of a drive wheel . Maximum lever movement means maximum fluid flow , which translates into a rapidly turning wheel . If one drive wheel turns more rapidly than the other , the machine moves along a curved path . If both wheels turn at the same speed , the machine follows a straight path . If one wheel stops and the other turns , or if the wheels turn in opposite directions , the mower pivots . Are these machines a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal effectively with **28;1079;TOOLONG so , in fact . The question is : Do you want or need that much maneuverability ? Read on to sort it out . Cub Cadet By far the most nearly commercial machine , the Cub was the fastest and : most powerful , and it had the largest deck . But those characteristics come at a price , literally , and we wondered whether an aggressive machine like this might be a bit more than the average homeowner needs or wants . Put it this way : It 's there if you want it , but the company also offers two other machines that cost about $2000 less and may well be a better fit for the average suburbanite . When we were a bit overzealous in operating this machine , it tended to spin a wheel mark into the lawn . A final note : The Cub was the only machine equipped with a safety PTO disengagement in reverse . That is , when you reverse the mower while cutting , the mower automatically disengages , and although you can continue to move in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then reengage it to resume cutting . Sears Craftsman The Craftsman was the only machine of the bunch with a singlecylinder engine , but it seemed to have ample power . The Craftsman and the nearly identical Ariens ( both made by Ariens ) have left and right steering levers that tilt to the side so that you can get on and off the machine easily . It was a simple and predictable mower to use , with a wellenclosed and easily accessible engine . Some of the controls , however , were a bit awkward . To set the parking brake , you lean forward and pull on a knob and then move the bar connected to the knob into a slot . Yes , it works , but it 's awkward . Likewise , the deck lift lever seemed a bit harder to use than it should have been . The machine 's other controls-the ignition , the PTO and the combination throttle-choke lever-were all easy to use . On a more positive note , the machine had responsive steering , and it cut well . Simplicity The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their highquality design . The engine 's V ( the point at which the two cylinders are connected to the crank ) points forward . This , and the chassis design , gave the machine a tidy , compact appearance , and would help Photograph CUB CADET CRAFTSMAN SIMPLICITY // ZERO-TURN RADIUS RIDING MOWER COMPARISON // it to tuck nicely into a garage . Another benefit of this compactness is that there are no overhanging projections , and this allows the mower to cut next to an object , and pivot away from it without an overhanging projection striking it . Another example of this harmonious approach are the twin knobs mounted on the steering column , below the steering levers . These allow you to individually adjust the levers ' travel to compensate for the difference in pressure applied with your hands and minor differences in operation of the twin hydrostatic transmissions . The payoff is a machine that steers easily and predictably while delivering a good quality of cut . Snapper The Snapper mower was a study in contrasts . It had the most comfortable seat , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncomfortable . The machine 's floating deck seemed like it would allow for a better cut over rough ground , though we did n't notice much difference in this portion of the test , compared to the other riding mowers . We also liked the machine 's accessible oil drain fitting that is opened and closed with a quarter-turn . On the other hand , the testers were unanimous in their dislike of the machine 's single joystick . Each one found it allowed for maneuverability but made it difficult to cut in a straight line with precision . Every tester marked down the machine 's exposed and unprotected muffler-a throwback to decadesold designs used on farm machinery and construction equipment . The machine 's construction was unsophisticated but rugged , with lots of square corners and exposed fasteners . We respect Snapper 's efforts to keep costs down by limiting tooling expenses , but we think people want a more sophisticated riding mower when they decide to spend this amount of money . Husqvarna The Husqvarna has a comparatively small engine and a number of very heavy components made of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall design proved very successful-even the fact that the model we tested was a dedicated mulching mower ( it can not side-discharge clippings ) . The four-wheeled machine has a steering wheel and highly visible front-mounted deck that was easily and precisely adjusted with a lever . The hydrostatic transmission is operated with two pedals-one for moving forward and one for reverse . About the only thing that required much effort was turning the steering wheel when the machine was stopped or creeping . You have to keep the machine moving to reduce steering resistance . Ariens Ariens , like Cub Cadet , enjoys a solid reputation in commercial/municipal turf care circles , and the company 's no-nonsense approach is evident in the Ariens ' bolt-together design-you 'll have to decide whether the sight of exposed fasteners and butt-welded joints Photograph HUSQVARNA , ARIENS SNAPPER // ZERO TURN MOWERS // is a big deal or not . This machine received good marks for ease of steering and quality of cut , but its marks were generally lower for its overall ease of use and the placement of controls ranging from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , here 's how it all shakes out . Husqvarna has had years of experience with its machine overseas , so it has had time to work the bugs out of its design . Its machine proved to be the most refined and easiest to use . It was comfortable and comparatively quiet , and its four-wheel design allowed it to work well over either smooth or bumpy ground . In all , it 's a great mower . Photograph The Cub Cadet had column-mounted steering/speed levers . A front handlebar helped the driver hold the lever in position . The Craftsman 's steering/speed levers pivoted to the side , allowing as to get on and off the mower easily . The Simplicity was the only mower that had a crank-operated deck height adjustment . It was precise and easy to use . Husqvarna used a substantial rear castiron counterweight to improve the mower 's traction on slopes and wet grass .

The Craftsman and Ariens mowers , not surprisingly , ranked very closely together , with the Craftsman just barely edging out the Ariens for third place because it seemed slightly more comfortable . The Ariens is appreciably quieter , however . We wanted at least one of the test mowers to mark the outside edge of what a homeowner can buy , and this slot was assigned Cub Cadet because it was the only manufacturer that had such a broad line of these machines . The Cub received high marks for its rugged , commercial-like construction , but it handled a bit too aggressively , we thought , so it 's probably not a good fit for the suburban homeowner . We would recommend , however , considering the company 's smaller , lighter and less powerful mowers . That leaves the Snapper . The testers were unanimous on this one . We understand that Snapper wanted to build a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hence the single joystick . But we just do n't agree with where the company took the product 's design . If you like the basic , farm implement nature of Snapper 's products , perhaps you will like this mower . It just was n't for us. pM For More On Home Improvement Check the Home channel on the PMZone Web site at **25;1109;TOOLONG <p>
