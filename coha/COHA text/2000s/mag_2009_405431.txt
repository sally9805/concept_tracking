TIME 'S PICKS FOR THE WEEK . 1 DVD The Seventh Seal and Bergman Island Ingmar Bergman 's 1957 morality play about a knight playing chess with Death never had such clarity as in Criterion 's Blu-ray edition . The big extra ( also sold separately ) is a 2003 docu-chat showing Bergman talking frankly about his films , his many women and , of course , God and death . 2 BOOK The Bolter In an amorous yet faithless marriage , at a time ( 1919 ) when affairs were rampant but divorce still scandalous , Idina Sackville did what few Englishwomen dared : she bolted . Her great-granddaughter Frances Osborne tracks Sackville 's headlong , lifelong pursuit of love . 3 DVD Louise Bourgeois Bourgeois , now 97 , is both the art world 's grande dame and its shameless old lady , spinning personal history into works of profound strangeness . Two filmmakers followed her from 1993 to 2007 to make this portrait of a tart , beguiling woman who did it her way . 4 ALBUM Lines , Vines and Trying Times The Jonas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fewer kiddie digressions , which makes the group 's seemingly abundant women troubles ( " Poison Ivy , " " World War III " and " What Did I Do to Your Heart " ) a little more believable . A. 5 BOOK The City &; the City Beszel and Ul Qoma are closer than your usual twin cities : they coexist uneasily on the same site but in different dimensions . Look , if I could explain it better , I 'd be China Miville , the darkly brilliant writer whose new police procedural is set in Beszel ( and Ul Qoma ) . Arts Online For more reviews and openings this weekend , go to time.com/entertainment SIDEBAR Joan Cusack 's Short List Ever since her 1980 film debut in My Bodyguard , actress Joan Cusack has been quite the working girl , with 39 films on her rsum and two Academy Award nominations . Next up is My Sister 's Keeper , out June 26 . Off the set , you can find Cusack cheering for the Chicago Blackhawks or reading to her son from dizzying heights . American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 10 years ago , and there were at least three Milton Avery paintings on the walls . They have been at the forefront of my art sense ever since . Avery was often called the American Matisse , and his work is peaceful , gentle and sophisticated . Hooked on hockey Blackhawks hockey is so exciting , especially if you get to go to the games . It 's great family time too . I learned about hockey from watching my sons learn to play , and now I am hooked . A gal 's gal Junie B. Jones is a character in a series of books by Barbara Park . I discovered this sweet , delicious maiden while reading to my son Dylan when we rented a cabin that was so vertical that I almost got dizzy . Nonetheless , we would climb to the top of a bunk bed , and I would read Junie B. Jones to him . She 's a gal 's gal -- fearless , joyful , fully human and sooooooo funny . Inspiration , in and out of the kitchen Julia Child is a role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did n't learn to cook till she was 37 and did n't start her career till age 50 . She was not perfect and did not preach perfection but delight . She found her passion . Incongruous comedy I love the kind of comedy that comes from the incongruity of things . Monty Python is wild but often very real as incongruent comedy . And Walter Matthau and Elaine May in A New Leaf epitomize my idea of comedy .
