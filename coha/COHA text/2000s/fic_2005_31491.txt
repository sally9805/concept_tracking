Saturday , the last day of August , I started work before dawn . I did not witness mist burning off the grass or the sky turning brilliant blue . Steel tables were occupied by bodies all morning , and there are no windows in the morgue . Labor Day weekend had begun with a bang of car crashes and gunfire in the city of Richmond . It was two o'clock in the afternoon when I finally returned to my West End home and heard Bertha mopping in the kitchen . She cleaned for me every Saturday and knew from past instruction not to bother with the phone , which had just begun to ring . " I 'm not here , " I said loudly as I opened the refrigerator . Bertha stopped mopping . " It was ringing a minute ago , " she said . " Rang a few minutes before that , too . Same man . " " No one 's home , " I repeated . " Whatever you say , Dr. Kay . " The mop moved across the floor again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intruding upon the sun-washed kitchen . The Hanover tomatoes I took for granted during the summer I began to hoard with the approach of fall . There were only three left . Where was the chicken salad ? A beep was followed by the familiar male voice . " Doc ? It 's Marino ... " Oh , Lord , I thought , shovingthe refrigerator door shut with a hip . Richmond homicide detective Pete Marino had been on the street since midnight , and I had just seen him in the morgue as I was picking bullets out of one of his cases . He was supposed to be on his way to Lake Gaston for what was left of a weekend of fishing . I was looking forward to working in my yard . " I 've been trying to get you , am heading out . You 'll have to try my pager ... " Marino 's voice sounded urgent as I snatched up the receiver . " I 'm here . " " That you or your goddam machine ? " " Take a guess , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoned car . New Kent , the Sixty-four rest stop , westbound . Benton just got hold of me  --  " " Another couple ? " I interrupted , my plans for the day forgotten . " Fred Cheney , white male , nineteen . Deborah Harvey , white female , nineteen . Last seen around eight last night when they drove off from the Harveys ' Richmond house , on their way to Spindrift . " " And the car 's in the westbound lane ? " I inquired , for Spindrift , North Carolina , is three and a half hours east of Richmond . " Yo . Appears they was heading in the opposite direction , back into the city . A trooper found the car , a Jeep Cherokee , about an hour ago . No sign of the kids . " " I 'm leaving now , " I told him . Bertha had not stopped mopping , but I knew she had picked up every word . " Be on my way soon as I finish up in here , " she assured me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't you worry , Dr. Kay . " Fear was running along my nerves as I grabbed my purse and hurried out to my car . There were four couples so far . Each had disappeared , eventually to be found murdered within a fifty-mile radius of Williamsburg . The cases , dubbed by the press as The Couple Killings , were inexplicable , and no one seemed to have a clue or credible theory , not even the FBI and its Violent Criminal Apprehension Program , or VICAP , which featured a national data base run on an artificial intelligence computer capable of connecting missing persons with unidentified bodies and linking serial crimes . After the first couple 's bodies were found more than two years ago , a VICAP regional team , comprising FBI Special Agent Benton Wesley and veteran Richmond homicide detective Pete Marino , was invited by local police to assist . Another couple would disappear , then two more . In each instance , by the time VICAP could be notified , by the time the National Crime Information Center , or NCIC , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing teenagers were already dead and decomposing in woods somewhere . Turning off the radio , I passed through a tollbooth and picked up speed on I-64 East . Images , voices suddenly came back to me . Bones and rotted clothing scattered with leaves . Attractive , smiling faces of missing teenagers printed in the newspapers , and bewildered , distraught families interviewed on television and calling me on the phone . " I 'm so sorry about your daughter . " " Please tell me how my baby died . Oh , God , did she suffer ? " " Her cause of death is undetermined , Mrs. Bennett . There 's nothing else I can tell you at this time . " " What do you mean you do n't know ? " " All that remains is his bones , Mr. Martin . When soft tissue is gone , gone with it is any possible injury ... " " I do n't want to hear your medical bullshit ! I want to know what killed my boy ! The cops are asking about drugs ! My boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken drugs ! You hear me , lady ? He 's dead , and they 're making him out to be some sort of punk ... " " CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER BAFFLED : Dr. Kay Scarpetta Unable to Tell Cause of Death . " Undetermined . Over and over again . Eight young people . It was awful . It was , in fact , unprecedented for me . Every forensic pathologist has undetermined cases , but I had never had so many that appeared to be related . I opened the sunroof and my spirits were lifted somewhat by the weather . The temperature was in the low eighties , leaves would be turning soon . It was only in the fall and spring that I did not miss Miami . Richmond summers were just as hot , without benefit of ocean breezes to sweep the air clean . The humidity was horrible , and in winter I fared no better , for I do not like the cold . But spring and fall were intoxicating . I drank in the change , and it went straight to my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly thirty-one miles from my house . It could have been any rest stop in Virginia , with picnic tables , grills and wooden trash barrels , brick-enclosed bathrooms and vending machines , and newly planted trees . But there was not a traveler or a truck driver in sight , and police cars were everywhere . A trooper , hot and unsmiling in his blue-gray uniform , walked toward me as I parked near the ladies ' room . " I 'm sorry , ma'am , " he said , leaning close to my open window . " This rest area 's closed today . I 'm going to have to ask you to drive on . " " Dr. Kay Scarpetta , " I identified myself , switching off the ignition . " The police asked me to come . " " For what purpose , ma'am ? " " I 'm the chief medical examiner , " I replied . As he looked me over , I could see the skeptical glint in his eyes . I supposed I did not look particularly " chiefly . " Dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and leather walking shoes , I was without the accouterments of authority , including my state car , which was in the state garage awaiting new tires . At a glance , I was a not-so-young yuppie running errands in her dark gray Mercedes , a distracted ash-blonde en route to the nearest shopping mall . " I 'll need some identification . " Digging inside my purse , I produced a thin black wallet and displayed my brass medical examiner 's shield , then handed over my driver 's license , both of which he studied for a long moment . I sensed he was embarrassed . " Just leave your car here , Dr. Scarpetta . The folks you 're looking for are in back . " He pointed in the direction of the parking area for trucks and buses . " Have a nice one , " he added inanely , stepping away . I followed a brick walk . When I rounded the building and passed beneath the shade of trees , I was greeted by several more police cars , a tow truck with light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniforms and plain clothes . I did not see the red Jeep Cherokee until I was almost upon it . Midway along the exit ramp , it was well off the pavement in a dip and obscured by foliage . Two-door , it was coated with a film of dust . When I looked in the driver 's window I could see that the beige leather interior was very clean , the backseat neatly packed with various items of luggage , a slalom ski , a coiled yellow nylon ski rope , and a red-and-white plastic ice chest . Keys dangled from the ignition . Windows were partly rolled down . Depressed tire tracks leading from the pavement were clearly visible in the sloping grass , the front chrome grille nudged up against a clump of pines . Marino was talking to a thin , blond man , someone he introduced as Jay Morrell with the state police , whom I did not know . He seemed to be in charge . " Kay Scarpetta , " I volunteered , since Marino identified me only as " Doc . " Morrell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Out of uniform and sporting a mustache that was little more than teenage fuzz , he exuded the all-business bravado I associated with investigators brand-new on the job . " Here 's what we know so far . " He was glancing around nervously . " The Jeep belongs to Deborah Harvey , and she and her boyfriend , uh , Fred Cheney , left the Harveys ' residence last night at approximately eight p.m . They were heading to Spindrift , where the Harvey family owns a beach house . " " Was Deborah Harvey 's family home when the couple left Richmond ? " I inquired . " No , ma'am . " He briefly turned his shades my way . " They were already at Spindrift , had left earlier in the day . Deborah and Fred wanted to go in a separate car because they planned to return to Richmond on Monday . Both of them are sophomores at Carolina , and needed to come back early to get ready to return to school . " Marino explained as he got out his cigarettes , " Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called up Spindrift , told one of Deborah 's brothers they was heading out and would be arriving sometime between midnight and one a.m . When they did n't show up by four o'clock this morning , Pat Harvey called the police . " " Pat Harvey ? " I looked at Marino in disbelief . It was Officer Morrell who replied , " Oh , yeah . We got us a good one , all right . Pat Harvey 's on her way here even as we speak . A chopper picked her up "  --  he glanced at his watch  --  " about a half hour ago . The father , uh , Bob Harvey , he 's on the road . Was in Charlotte on business and was supposed to get to Spindrift sometime tomorrow . As far as we know , he has n't been reached yet , does n't know what 's happened . " Pat Harvey was the National Drug Policy Director , a position the media had dubbed Drug Czar . A presidential appointee who not so long ago had been on the cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most powerful and admired women in America . " What about Benton ? " I asked Marino . " Is he aware Deborah Harvey is Pat Harvey 's daughter ? " " He did n't say nothing about it to me . When he called , he 'd just landed in Newport News  --  the Bureau flew him in . He was in a hurry to find a rental car . We did n't talk long . " That answered my question . Benton Wesley would not be rushing here in a Bureau plane unless he knew who Deborah Harvey was . I wondered why he had not said anything to Marino , his VICAP partner , and I tried to read Marino 's broad , impassive face . His jaw muscles were flexing , the top of his balding head flushed and beaded with sweat . " What 's going on now , " Morrell resumed , " is I got a lot of men stationed around to keep out traffic . We 've looked in the bathrooms , poked around a little , to make sure the kids are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rescue get here , we 'll start in on the woods . " Immediately north of the Jeep 's front hood the well-attended landscaping of the rest stop was overcome by brush and trees that within an acre became so dense I could see nothing but sunlight caught in leaves and a hawk making circles over a distant stand of pines . Though shopping malls and housing developments continued their encroachment upon I-64 , this stretch between Richmond and Tidewater so far had remained unspoiled . The scenery , which I would have found reassuring and soothing in the past , now seemed ominous to me . " Shit , " Marino complained as we left Morrell and began walking around . " I 'm sorry about your fishing trip , " I said . " Hey . Ai n't it the way it always goes ? Been planning this damn trip for months . Screwed again . Nothing new . " " I noticed that when you pull off the Interstate , " I observed , ignoring his irritation , " the entrance ramp immediately divides into two ramps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rest stop . In other words , the ramps are one-way . It 's not possible to pull into the front area for cars , then change your mind and drive back here without going a considerable distance the wrong way on the ramp and risk hitting someone . And I would guess there was a fair amount of travelers on the road last night , since it 's Labor Day weekend . " " Right . I know that . It do n't take a rocket scientist to figure out that somebody intended to ditch the Jeep exactly where it is because there were probably a lot of cars parked in front last night . So he takes the ramp for trucks and buses . Probably was pretty deserted back here . Nobody sees him , and he splits . " " He may also not have wanted the Jeep found right away , explaining why it 's well off the pavement , " I said . Marino stared off toward the woods and said , " I 'm getting too old for this . " A perpetual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime scene and acting as if he did not want to be there . We had worked with each other long enough for me to be used to it , but this time his attitude struck me as more than an act . His frustration went deeper than the canceled fishing trip . I wondered if he had had a fight with his wife . " Well , well , " he mumbled , looking toward the brick building . " The Lone Ranger 's arrived . " I turned around as the lean , familiar figure of Benton Wesley emerged from the men 's room . He barely said " hello " when he got to us , his silver hair wet at the temples , the lapels of his blue suit speckled with water as if he had just washed his face . Eyes fixed impassively on the Jeep , he slipped a pair of sunglasses from his breast pocket and put them on . " Has Mrs. Harvey gotten here yet ? " he asked . " Nope , " Marino replied . " What about reporters ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Wesley 's mouth was firmly set , making his sharp-featured face seem harder and more unreachable than usual . I would have found him handsome were it not for his imperviousness . His thoughts and emotions were impossible to read , and of late he had become such a master at walling off his personality that I sometimes felt I did not know him . " We want to keep this under wraps as long as possible , " he went on . " The minute the word 's out all hell is going to break loose . " I asked him , " What do you know about this couple , Benton ? " " Very little . After Mrs. Harvey reported them missing early this morning , she called the Director at home and then he called me . Apparently , her daughter and Fred Cheney met at Carolina and had been dating since their freshman year . Both of them supposedly good , clean-cut kids . No history of any sort of trouble that might account for them getting tangled up with the wrong type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One thing I did pick up on was she had some ambivalence about the relationship , thought Cheney and her daughter spent too much time alone . " " Possibly the real reason for their wanting to drive to the beach in a separate car , " I said . " Yes , " Wesley replied , glancing around . " More than likely that was the real reason . I got the impression from the Director that Mrs. Harvey was n't keen on Deborah 's bringing her boyfriend to Spindrift . It was family time . Mrs. Harvey lives in D.C. during the week and had n't seen much of her daughter and two sons all summer . Frankly , I have the feeling that Deborah and her mother may not have been getting along very well of late , and may have had an argument right before the family headed off to North Carolina yesterday morning . " " What about the chance the kids might have run off together ? " Marino said . " They was smart , right ? Would read the papers , watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that TV special the other week . Point is , they probably knew about the cases around here . Who 's to say they did n't pull something ? A pretty slick way to stage a disappearance and punish your parents . " " It 's one of many scenarios we need to consider , " Wesley replied . " And it 's all the more reason I hope we can keep this from the media as long as possible . " Morrell joined us as we walked along the exit ramp back toward the Jeep . A pale blue pickup truck with a camper shell pulled up , and a man and a woman in dark jumpsuits and boots got out . Opening the tailgate , they let two panting , tail-wagging bloodhounds out of their crate . They snapped long leads to rings on the leather belts around their waists and grabbed each dog by its harness . " Salty , Neptune , heel ! " I did n't know which dog was which . Both were big and light tan with wrinkled faces and floppy ears . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doin ' , fella ? " Salty , or maybe it was Neptune , rewarded him with a wet kiss and a nuzzle to the leg . The dog handlers were from Yorktown , their names Jeff and Gail . Gail was as tall as her partner and looked just about as strong . She reminded me of women I 've seen who have spent their lives on farms , their faces lined by hard work and the sun , a stolid patience about them that comes from understanding nature and accepting its gifts and punishments . She was the search-and-rescue team captain , and I could tell from the way she was eyeing the Jeep that she was surveying it for any sign that the scene , and therefore the scents , had been disturbed . " Nothing 's been touched , " Marino told her , bending over to knead one of the dogs behind the ears . " We have n't even opened the doors yet . " " Do you know if anybody else has been inside it ? Maybe the person who found it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate number went out over teletype , BOLOs , early this morning  --  " " What the hell are BOLOs ? " Wesley interrupted . " Be On the Lookouts . " Wesley 's face was granite as Morrell went on , tediously , " Troopers do n't go through lineup , so they 're not always going to see a teletype . They just get in their cars and mark on . The dispatchers started sending BOLOs over the air the minute the couple was reported missing , and around one p.m. a trucker spotted the Jeep , radioed it in . The trooper who responded said that other than looking through the windows to make sure nobody was inside , he did n't even get close . " I hoped this was true . Most police officers , even those who know better , ca n't seem to resist opening doors and at least rummaging through the glove compartment in search of the owner 's identification . Taking hold of both harnesses , Jeff took the dogs off to " use the potty " while Gail asked , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Pat Harvey was asked to bring along anything Deborah might have been wearing recently , " Wesley said . If Gail was surprised or impressed by whose daughter she was looking for , she did not show it but continued to regard Wesley expectantly . " She 's flying in by chopper , " Wesley added , glancing at his watch . " Should be here any minute . " " Well , just do n't be landing the big bird right here , " Gail commented , approaching the Jeep . " Do n't need anything stirring up the place . " Peering through the driver 's window , she studied the inside of the doors , the dash , taking in every inch of the interior . Then she backed away and took a long look at the black plastic door handle on the outside of the door . " Best thing 's probably going to be the seats , " she decided . " We 'll let Salty scent off one , Neptune off the other . But first , we got to get in without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Snatching a ballpoint Mont Blanc pen out of the breast pocket of his shirt , Wesley presented it to her . " Need one more , " she added . Amazingly , nobody else seemed to have a pen on his person , including me . I could have sworn I had several inside my purse . " How about a folding knife ? " Marino was digging in a pocket of his jeans . " Perfect . " Pen in one hand and Swiss army knife in the other , Gail simultaneously depressed the thumb button on the outside of the driver 's door and pried back the handle , then caught the door 's edge with the toe of her boot to gently pull it open . All the while I heard the faint , unmistakable thud-thud of helicopter blades growing louder . Moments later , a red-and-white Bell jet Ranger circled the rest stop , then hovered like a dragonfly , creating a small hurricane on the ground . All sound was drowned out , trees shaking and grass rippling in the roar of its terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squatting by the dogs , holding harnesses tight . Marino , Wesley , and I had retreated close to the buildings , and from this vantage we watched the violent descent . As the helicopter slowly nosed around in a maelstrom of straining engines and beating air , I caught a glimpse of Pat Harvey staring down at her daughter 's Jeep before sunlight whited out the glass . She stepped away from the helicopter , head bent and skirt whipping around her legs as Wesley waited a safe distance from the decelerating blades , necktie fluttering over his shoulder like an aviator 's scarf . Before Pat Harvey had been appointed the National Drug Policy Director , she had been a commonwealth 's attorney in Richmond , then a U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia . Her prosecution of high-profile drug cases in the federal system had occasionally involved victims I had autopsied . But I had never been called to testify ; only my reports had been subpoenaed . Mrs. Harvey and I had never actually met . On television and in newspaper photographs she came across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both feminine and strikingly attractive , slender , her features perfectly wrought , the sun finding hints of gold and red in her short auburn hair . Wesley made brief introductions , and Mrs. Harvey shook each of our hands with the politeness and self-assurance of a practiced politician . But she did not smile or meet anyone 's eyes . " There 's a sweatshirt inside , " she explained , handing a paper bag to Gail . " I found it in Debbie 's bedroom at the beach . I do n't know when she wore it last , but I do n't think it 's been recently washed . " " When 's the last time your daughter was at the beach ? " Gail inquired without opening the bag . " Early July . She went there with several friends for a weekend . " " And you 're sure she was the one wearing this ? Possible one of her friends might have ? " Gail asked casually , as though she were inquiring about the weather . The question caught Mrs. Harvey by surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . " I 'm not sure . " She cleared her throat . " I would assume Debbie was the one wearing it last , but obviously I ca n't swear to it . I was n't there . " She stared past us through the Jeep 's open door , her attention briefly fixed on the keys in the ignition , the silver " D " dangling from the keychain . For a long moment no one spoke , and I could see the struggle of mind against emotion as she warded off panic with denial . Turning back to us , she said , " Debbie would have been carrying a purse . Nylon , bright red . One of those sports purses with a Velcro-lined flap . I 'm wondering if you found it inside ? " " No , ma'am , " Morrell replied . " At least we have n't seen anything like that yet , not from looking through the windows . But we have n't searched the interior , could n't until the dogs got here . " " I would expect it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor , " she went on . Morrell shook his head . It was Wesley who spoke . " Mrs. Harvey , do you know if your daughter had much money with her ? " " I gave her fifty dollars for food and gas . I do n't know what she might have had beyond that , " she replied . " She also , of course , had charge cards . Plus her checkbook . " " You know what she had in her checking account ? " Wesley asked . " Her father gave her a check last week , " she replied matter-of-factly . " For college  --  books , and so on . I 'm fairly certain she 's already deposited it . I suppose she should have at least a thousand dollars in her account . " " You might want to look into that , " Wesley proposed . " Make certain the money was n't recently withdrawn . " " I will do so immediately . " As I stood by and watched , I could sense hope blossoming in her mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to money in a checking account . It did not appear that she had left her purse inside the Jeep , meaning she might still have it with her . Meaning she might still be alive and well and off somewhere with her boyfriend . " Your daughter ever threaten to run away with Fred ? " Marino asked her bluntly . " No . " Staring again at the Jeep , she added what she wanted to believe , " But that does n't mean it is n't possible . " " What was her mood when you talked to her last ? " Marino went on . " We exchanged words yesterday morning before my sons and I left for the beach , " she replied in a detached , flat tone . " She was upset with me . " " She know about the cases around here ? The missing couples ? " Marino asked . " Yes , of course . We have discussed them , wondered about them . She knew . " Gail said to Morrell , " We ought to get started . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Gail looked at Mrs. Harvey . " You got any idea who was driving ? " " Fred , I suspect , " she answered . " When they went places together , he usually drove . " Nodding , Gail said , " Guess I 'm going to need that pocketknife and pen again . " Collecting them from Wesley and Marino , she went around to the passenger 's side and opened the door . She grasped one of the bloodhounds ' harnesses . Eagerly , he got up and moved in perfect accord with his mistress 's feet , snuffling along , muscles rippling beneath his loose , glossy coat , ears dragging heavily , as if lined with lead . " Come on , Neptune , let 's put that magic nose of yours to work . " We watched in silence as she directed Neptune 's nose at the bucket seat where Deborah Harvey was presumed to have been sitting yesterday . Suddenly he yelped as if he had encountered a rattlesnake , jerking back from the Jeep , practically wrenching the harness from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs and the fur literally stood up on his back as a chill ran up my spine . " Easy , boy . Easy ! " Whimpering and quivering all over , Neptune squatted and defecated in the grass . Continues ...
