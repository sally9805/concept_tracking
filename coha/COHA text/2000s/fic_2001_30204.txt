OCTOBER 8 , 1999 11:15 PM So let me get this straight , " Joanna Meissner said to Carlton Williams . The two friends were sitting in the dark inside Carlton 's Jeep Cherokee in a no-parking zone on Craigie Street along side the Craigie Arms apartment building in Cambridge , Massachusetts . " You 've decided that it would be best for us to wait to be married until after you finish your surgical residency some three or four years from now . " " I have n't decided anything , " Carlton said defensively . " We 're having a discussion here . " Joanna and Carlton had been out to dinner in Harvard Square that Friday evening and had been enjoying themselves until Joanna had brought up the sore subject of their long-term plans . As usual , from that moment on , the tone of the conversation had deteriorated . They had been over this thorny issue many times in the past as a consequence of their engagement . Theirs was a quintessentially long affair ; they had known each other since kindergarten and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Listen , " Carlton said soothingly . " I 'm just trying to think of what 's best for both of us . " " Oh , bull ! " Joanna blurted . Despite her vow to herself to stay calm , she could feel anger brewing in hergut as if she were a nuclear reactor about to go critical . " I 'm serious , " Carlton said . " Joanna , I 'm working my tail off . You know how often I 'm on call . You know the hours . Being a resident at the MGH is a hell of a lot more demanding than I 'd ever guessed . " " What difference does that make ? " Joanna snapped , unable to keep the irritation she felt from being painfully obvious . She could n't help feeling betrayed and rejected . " It makes a lot of difference , " Carlton persisted . " I 'm exhausted . I 'm no fun to be with . I ca n't have a normal conversation outside of what 's going on in the hospital . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's happening in Boston , much less the world . " " That kind of comment might have some validity if we were dating casually . But the fact of the matter is we 've been seeing each other for eleven years . And up until I broached this delicate issue of setting a date tonight , you were enjoying yourself , and you were perfectly fun to be with . " " I certainly love seeing you ... " Carlton said . " That 's reassuring , " Joanna interjected sarcastically . " What I find particularly ironic about this situation is that you 're the one who asked me to marry you , not vice versa . The trouble is , that was seven years ago . I 'd say that suggests your ardor has significantly cooled . " " It has n't , " Carlton protested . " I do want to marry you . " " I 'm sorry , but you 're not convincing . Not after all this time . First you wanted to graduate from college . That was fine . No problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should just get through the first two years of medical school . Even that was okay with me since I could get most of my Ph.D . coursework out of the way . But then you thought it best to put things off until you got yourself all the way through medical school . Are you detecting a pattern here or is it just me ? Then the issue became getting the first year of residency behind you . Stupid me even accepted that , but now it 's the whole residency business . What about the fellowship deal you talked about last month ? And then after that you might even think it best to wait while you set up your practice . " " I 'm trying to be rational about this , " Carlton said . " It 's a difficult decision , and it behooves us to weigh the pros and cons ... " Joanna was no longer listening . Instead her emerald-green eyes wandered away from the face of her fianc who , she recognized , was n't even looking at her as he spoke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this conversation ; as far as she could tell , he 'd only guiltily met her glare during her monologue . With unseeing eyes she stared straight ahead into the middle distance . All at once it was as if she had been slapped across the face by an invisible hand . Carlton 's suggestion of yet another delay in setting a marriage date had spawned an epiphany , and she found herself laughing , not out of humor but disbelief . Carlton halted in midsentence while enumerating the pros and the cons of getting married sooner rather than later . " What are you laughing about ? " he asked . He raised his eyes from watching himself fumble with the ignition keys and gazed at Joanna in the car 's dim interior . Her face was silhouetted against the dark side window by a distant streetlamp whose light fingered its way through the windshield . Her sleek and delicate profile was limned by her lustrous flaxen hair , which appeared to glow in the half light . Diamond-like flashes glistened from her starkly white teeth just visible through her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the most beautiful woman in the world even when she was badgering him . Ignoring Carlton 's question , Joanna continued her soft , mirthless laugh as the clarity of her revelation sharpened . Precipitously , she 'd come to acknowledge the validity of what her roommate Deborah Cochrane and her other female friends had been hawking all along , namely that marriage in and of itself should not be her life 's goal . They 'd been right after all : she 'd been programmed by the totality of her suburban Houston upbringing . Joanna could n't believe she 'd been so stupid for so long and so resistant to question a value system she 'd so blindly accepted . Thankfully , while treading water waiting for Carlton , she 'd been smart enough to lay the foundation of a rewarding career . She was only a thesis away from a Ph.D . from Harvard in economics and she had extensive computer skills . " What are you laughing about ? " Carlton persisted . " Come on ! Talk to me ! " " I 'm laughing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at her fianc . He appeared perplexed , with his brows tightly knit . " I do n't understand , " Carlton said . " That 's curious , " Joanna said . " I see everything rather clearly . " She glanced down at the engagement ring on her left hand . The diamond solitaire sucked in the weak available light and threw it back at Joanna with surprising intensity . The stone had been Carlton 's grandmother 's , and Joanna had been thrilled with it , mostly because of its sentimental value . But now it seemed like a vulgar neon reminder of her own gullibility . A sudden sense of claustrophobia gripped Joanna . Without any warning she unlatched the door , slid out , and stood up on the curb . " Joanna ! " Carlton called . He leaned across the car 's center console and peered up into Joanna 's face . Her expression was one of fierce resolve . Her usually soft lips were set in grim determination . Carlton started to ask Joanna what was the matter , although he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentence out , the car door slammed in his face . Pushing himself back upright , he groped for the passenger-side window button . When the window opened , Joanna leaned in . Her expression had n't changed . " Do n't insult me by asking what 's the matter , " she said . " You 're not being very adult about this , " Carlton stated firmly . " Thank you for your unbiased assessment , " Joanna retorted . " I also want to thank you for making everything so clear for me . It certainly makes it easier to make up my mind . " " Make up your mind about what ? " Carlton asked . The newly found firmness of his voice vanished . In its place was a definite quaver . He had a premonition about what was coming , and it was accompanied by a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach . " About my future , " Joanna said . " Here ! " She extended her clenched fist with the obvious intention of giving something to Carlton . Carlton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something cold drop into his hand . Glancing down , he found himself staring at his grandmother 's diamond . " What 's this all about ? " Carlton stammered . " I think it 's pretty clear , " Joanna said . " Consider yourself free to finish your residency and whatever else your little heart desires . I certainly do n't want to think of myself as a drag . " " You 're not serious ? " Carlton questioned . Caught completely off guard by this sudden turn of events , he was befuddled . " Oh , but I am , " Joanna said . " Consider our engagement officially over . Good night , Carlton . " Turning on her heels Joanna walked back along Craigie Street toward Concord Avenue and the entrance to the Craigie Arms . Her apartment was on the third floor . After a brief struggle with the door release Carlton leaped from his Cherokee and ran after Joanna , who 'd already reached the corner . A few deep red maple leaves , which had fallen from the tree that very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his former fiance as she was about to enter her apartment building . He was out of breath . He was clutching the engagement ring in his fist . " All right , " Carlton managed . " You 've made your point . Here , take the ring back . " He extended his hand . Joanna shook her head . Her grim determination had disappeared . In its place was a tenuous smile . " I did n't give the ring back as a mere gesture or machination . Nor am I actually angry . You obviously do n't want to get married now , and all at once , I do n't either . Let 's give it a rest . We 're still friends . " " But I love you , " Carlton blurted . " I 'm flattered , " Joanna said . " And I suppose I still love you , but things have been dragging on for too long . Let 's go our separate ways , at least for now . " But ... " " Good night , Carlton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiptoes and gave Carlton 's cheek a brush with her lips . A moment later she was in the elevator . She had n't looked back . Putting her key in her apartment door she noticed she was trembling . Despite her airy dismissal of Carlton , she felt her emotions rumbling just below the surface . " Wow ! " her roommate Deborah Cochrane exclaimed . She checked the task bar on her computer to see the time . " Rather early for a Friday night . Wussup ? " Deborah was dressed in oversized Harvard-emblazoned sweats . In comparison with the soft , porcelain femininity of her roommate she was mildly tomboyish with short dark hair , Mediterranean olive complexion , and an athletic build . Her facial features contributed by being stronger and more rounded than Joanna 's yet still unerringly female . All in all the roommates complimented each other and emphasized each other 's natural attractiveness . Joanna did n't respond as she hung up her coat in the hall closet . Deborah watched her closely as she came into their sparsely furnished living room and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself and only then met Deborah 's inquisitive eyes . " Do n't tell me you guys had a fight , " Deborah said . " Not a fight per se , " Joanna said . " Just a parting of ways . " Deborah 's jaw dropped . For the six years she 'd known Joanna , from freshman orientation onward , Carlton had been a fixture in Joanna 's life . As far as she was concerned there 'd not been the slightest hint of discord within the relationship . " What happened ? " she asked with astonishment . " I suddenly saw the light , " Joanna said . There was a slight trill to her voice that Deborah noticed instantly . " My engagement is off , and , more importantly , I 'm not going to count on getting married , period . If it happens , fine , but if it does n't , that 's okay too . " " My word ! " Deborah said , unable to keep the glee from her voice . " This does n't sound like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I 've come to love . Why the change of heart ? " Deborah considered Joanna 's march toward marriage almost religious in its unswerving intensity . " Carlton wanted to postpone the wedding until after his residency , " Joanna said . In short order , she recounted the last fifteen minutes of her date with Carlton . Deborah listened with rapt attention . " Are you all right ? " Deborah asked when Joanna fell silent . She leaned forward to peer more directly into Joanna 's eyes . " Better than I would have guessed , " Joanna admitted . " I feel a little shaky , I suppose , but all things considered , I 'm doing okay . " " Then this calls for a celebration , " Deborah exclaimed . She stood up and bounced into the kitchen . " I 've been saving that bottle of champagne cluttering up the fridge for months , " she called over her shoulder . " This is the time to open it . " " I suppose , " Joanna managed . She did n't feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken too much effort . " All right ! " Deborah exclaimed as she returned with the champagne in one hand and two flutes in the other . She knelt at the coffee table and attacked the bottle . The cork came away with a resounding pop and caromed off the ceiling . Deborah laughed but noticed Joanna did n't . " Are you sure you 're okay ? " Deborah asked . " I have to say , it 's a big adjustment . " " That 's an understatement , " Deborah averred . " Knowing you as well as I do , it 's the equivalent of Saint Paul falling on the way to Damascus . You 've been programmed by the Houston social scene toward marriage since you were nothing but a twinkle in your mother 's eye . " Joanna laughed despite herself . Deborah poured the champagne too quickly . Both glasses filled , mostly with fizz , and spilled out on the table . Undeterred , Deborah snatched the flutes and handed one to Joanna . Then she made Joanna clink glasses with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Deborah said . Both women lifted their stem ware and tried to drink . They coughed on the foam and laughed . Not wanting to lose the moment , Deborah quickly took both glasses into the kitchen , rinsed them , and returned . This time she poured more carefully by letting the champagne run down the side of the glass . When they drank it was mostly liquid . " Not the greatest bubbly , " Deborah admitted . " But it 's not surprising . David gave it to me way back when . Unfortunately he was a cheapskate from the word go . " Deborah had broken off a four-month relationship with her most recent boyfriend , David Curtis , the week before . In sharp contrast to Joanna 's , her longest relationship had been less than two years and that was way back in high school . In many ways the two women could n't have been more different . Instead of the affluent southern suburban social scene complete with debutante balls funded by oil money which Joanna had enjoyed , Deborah grew up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academia . Deborah had never known her father , since it was her imminent birth that had ended her parents ' relationship . Her mother had n't married until relatively late in life , after Deborah had left for college . " I 've not been much of a champagne fan anyway , " Joanna said . " I actually would n't even know if it were good stuff or not . " She twirled the glass in her fingers , momentarily mesmerized by the effervescence . " What happened to your ring ? " Deborah asked , noticing for the first time that the jewelry was gone . " I gave it back , " Joanna said casually . Deborah shook her head . She was amazed . Joanna had loved the diamond and everything it stood for . She 'd rarely taken it from her finger . " I 'm serious about this , " Joanna said . " I 'm getting that impression , " Deborah said . She was momentarily speechless . The phone shattered the short silence . Deborah stood up to get it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk with him , " Joanna said . Over at the desk Deborah checked the caller ID screen . " You 're right , it 's Carlton . " " Let the answering machine get it , " Joanna said . Deborah returned to the coffee table and plopped herself back down . The two women eyed each other as the phone continued its insistent ring . After the fourth ring the answering machine picked up . There was silence while the outgoing message played . Then Carlton 's anxious voice along with a bit of static filled the ascetically decorated room . " You 're right , Joanna ! Waiting until I finish my residency is a stupid idea . " " I never said it was a stupid idea , " Joanna interjected in a forced whisper as if the caller could hear . " And you know what ? " Carlton continued . " Why do n't we go ahead and plan for this June . As I recall , you always said you wanted a June wedding . Well , June 's fine by me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get this message , and we can talk about it . Okay ? " The answering machine made a few more mechanical sounds before the little red light on the front of the console began to blink . " That shows you how much he knows , " Joanna said . " There 's no way my mother could put together a proper Houston wedding in eight months . " " He sounds a little desperate , " Deborah said . " If you want to call him back and want some privacy , I can make myself scarce . " " I do n't want to talk with him , " Joanna said quickly . " Not now . " Deborah cocked her head to the side and studied her friend 's face . She wanted to be supportive but for the moment was confused how best to play that role . " This is n't an argument he and I are having , " Joanna explained . " Nor is it some kind of lover 's game . I 'm not trying to be manipulative , and frankly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " This is a total switch . " " Exactly , " Joanna said . " Here he is trying to move the date up and I 'd be arguing to postpone . I need some time and space . " " I understand completely , " Deborah said . " And you know what ? I think you 're being smart not to let this situation turn into a petulant debate . " " The problem is I do love him , " Joanna said with a wry smile . " If there was any debate , I might lose . " Deborah laughed . " I agree . You 're such a new convert to a more modern , sensible attitude about marriage , that you 're vulnerable to a relapse . You definitely need time and space . And you know what ? I think I have the answer . " " The answer to what ? " Joanna asked . " Let me show you something , " Deborah said . She climbed to her feet and picked up the latest issue of the Harvard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the classified section . She handed the paper to Joanna . Joanna scanned the page and read the circled ad . She looked up at Deborah questioningly . " Is this ad from the Wingate Clinic what you wanted me to see ? " " It is indeed , " Deborah said enthusiastically . " This is an advertisement for egg donors , " Joanna said . " Precisely , " Deborah said . " How is this the answer ? " Joanna asked . Deborah came around the coffee table and sat down next to Joanna . With her index finger she pointed to the offered compensation . " The money is the answer , " she said . " Forty-five thousand dollars a pop ! " " This ad was in an issue of the Crimson last spring and caused a buzz , " Joanna said . " Then it never reappeared . Do you think it 's legit or some kind of college prank ? " " I think it 's legit , " Deborah said . " Wingate is an infertility clinic in Bookford , Massachusetts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form their website . " " Why are they willing to pay so much money ? " Joanna asked . " The website says they have some wealthy clients who are willing to pay for what they consider the best . Apparently these clients want Harvard coeds . It must be something like that sperm bank in California where the donors are all Nobel laureates . It 's lunacy from a genetic point of view , but who are we to question . " " We 're certainly not Nobel laureates , " Joanna said . " Technically , we 're not even Harvard coeds . What makes you think they 'd be interested in you and me ? " " Why would n't they be ? " Deborah asked . " I think being grad students qualifies us as Harvard coeds . I ca n't imagine it 's just undergraduates that they 're looking for . In fact , the website specifies they 're interested in women twenty-five and younger . We just make it under the wire . " " But it also says we have to be emotionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are n't we stretching reality a bit here ? " " Hey , I think we 're perfect . " " Athletic ? " Joanna questioned with a smile . " Maybe you , but not me . And emotionally stable . That 's pushing the envelope , especially in my current state . " " Well , we can give it a go , " Deborah said . " Maybe you 're not the most athletically inclined female on campus , but we 'll tell them we 'll only consider donating as a pair . They have to take both of us . All or nothing . " " Are you truly serious about this ? " Joanna asked . She eyed her roommate who could be a tease on occasion . " I was n't at first , " Deborah admitted . " But then I got to thinking about it earlier in the evening . I mean , the money is enticing . Can you imagine : forty-five grand apiece ! That kind of money could give us some freedom for the first time in our lives even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have so recently opted out of the economic security of the marital goal , the idea should be even more seductive from your perspective . You need some equity besides your education to maintain your resolve and , frankly , to begin planning for the life of a single individual . This kind of money could be the start . " Joanna tossed the school newspaper onto the coffee table . " Sometimes I ca n't tell when you are pulling my leg . " " Hey , I 'm not joking . You said you need time and space . This kind of money could provide it and more . Here 's the deal . We both go out to this Wingate Clinic , give them a couple of eggs , and collect ninety K. Of that we take about fifty K and buy a two-bedroom condo in Boston or Cambridge , which we rent out to pay the mortgage . " " Why would we buy a condo to rent it ? " Joanna asked . " Let me finish , " Deborah said . " But would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Remember : I 'm the economist and you 're the biologist . " " You might be getting a Ph.D . in economics , but you 're a babe in the woods in relation to being a single female in the twenty-first century . So shut up and listen . We buy the condo to begin establishing some real roots . In the previous generation females looked to marriage for that , but now we have to do it for ourselves . An apartment would be a nice start as well as a good investment . " " My word ! " Joanna exclaimed . " You 're way ahead of me . " " You bet your sweet ass , " Deborah said . " And there 's more . Here 's the best part : We take the other forty K and go to Venice to write our Ph.D . theses . " " Venice ! " Joanna cried . " You 're crazy , girl ! " ( Continues ... )                 @ @ @ @
