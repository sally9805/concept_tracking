It was the dog that awakened her , the strange noises he made . A yelping whine , then a bark . Then nothing , and she drifted back to sleep with the soft whirr of the air conditioner . Rain tapped on the roof of the cottage , and dim light came through the window . Then the barking started up again . Diane thought Jack might come down from the house and see about it , because after all , Buddy was his damned dog . She remembered that Jack had thrown a parry last night , and he 'd been happily drunk when she 'd gotten home at midnight . It had been three in the morning before the music and laughter had quieted down . Roof-roof-roof . Roof-roof . Hyeeeeeeee Diane shoved the pillow off her head and squinted at her clock . 6:45 . " Oh , great . " In plaid boxers and a camisole , she stumbled out onto the small wooden porch . Nothing stirred in the yard . All she could see of Jack 's house was some white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other direction , past the mildewing seawall , lower Biscayne Bay gleamed as dully as an old nickel . No dog anywhere in sight . " Stupid mutt . " A walkway ran across the yard , vanishing under a cedar trellis and into a thick stand of palm trees . He was in there . Roof-roof . Roof . " Buddy ! Come ! " What was he doing ? Diane thought of bufo toadshuge , slimy creatures with poisonous skin . Buddy would taste anything . She ran down the steps and across the yard , then under the trellis . Vines decades old kept out the rain , and the light dimmed . Dead leavesstuck to her bare feet . There was a fountain farther on , and Diane could hear it . The path turned , then opened up to a semicircle of teak benches , beds of bromeliads , and hanging baskets of orchids . Jack 's black Lab stood right in the middle of the path . He turned his head and looked at her , and his tail wagged . Diane came closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The low , overcast sun barely penetrated the shade , and the thingwhatever it waslay halfway under some bushes . Gradually the details became clear . A man 's legs in tan slacks , feet pointing upward . An arm . Barking , the dog loped toward her . Diane stumbled , caught herself , and raced back the way she had come , along the path , under the trellis , and across the wet grass to Jack 's house , then up the steps . Her hair fell from its knot and into her eyes . Buddy danced in circles around her . She flung open the screen door , leaving him in the yard . A spare key was hidden in a conch shell . She retrieved it in trembling fingers and jammed it into the lock . The back door opened into the kitchen . " Jack ! Jack ! " She ran through the hall , slipping as she rounded the corner . Dim light came from a globe held aloft by a bronze nude . " Jack ! " Her feet thudded up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door swung open and Jack came out in old hiking shorts . " I 'm up ! What in the name of God 's little angels is going on ? " He was pulling a faded green T-shirt down over his belly . His eyes were puffy , and his big sandy mustache was turned up on one end , down on the other . " There 's a man by the fountain . On the pathoh , my God , Jackhe 's dead . I heard Buddy barking , and I went to see " Diane steadied herself on Jack 's shoulder . " And there was a man lying on the ground . I think he 's dead . " " What do you mean , dead ? " " I mean not breathing , Jack ! Not moving . " " Maybe he 's sleeping . " " No ! Buddy 's been barking forever . " " Well , who is it ? " " I do n't know ! I was afraid to look ! " " Calm down . " Jack rubbed his face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's probably asleep . Wait for me downstairs . I 'm going to get some shoes on . " " Do you want me to call the police ? " " No . If you want to be helpful , ma petite , go make some coffee . " The door closed . Diane heard a woman 's voice . Then Jack 's low murmur . A few seconds later he came out in his old leather boat shoes . The door closed , but not soon enough to cut off a view of tangled red hair and a sheet clutched to somebody 's breasts . Jack 's stern glance admonished Diane for not being downstairs already . At the landing she whispered , " That was Nikki . " " Shhh . You saw nothing , child . " He nudged her along . Jack looked out the kitchen window as if the wild landscaping would part and reveal whatever was there . He held aside the curtain with one hand and with the other twirled the ends of his big mustache into points . " I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day in the sack . No hope of that now . " He dropped the curtain . " If my guest ventures downstairs , tell her to stay in the house . I 'll go have a look-see . " " What about the coffee ? " " Of course . Start the coffeenot that I need it after this jolt . " Jack pushed open the back door . The dog rose from the mat , and its swaying tail tipped over a beer bottle . More of them littered the porch . The ashtrays were full , and a roach clip lay on a side table . Dead ? Dead drunk was more like it . Guests had occasionally been found in the yard , sleeping it off , but not , he had to admit , this time of year , not with mosquitos chewing on exposed flesh and humidity so high one could work up a sweat breathing . The drizzle was turning to rain . Jack touched his .38 snub-nose through his pocket . The neighborhood was generally safe , and he did n't expect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never knew . Buddy trotted along beside him . The main walkway from the house , paved with old keystone , arrowed to the seawall and a boathouse , where Jack kept his fishing boat raised on davits . Stepping-stones curved left toward the cottage , and another path meandered through a collection of rare plants and palm trees to the grotto . That had been his cousin Maggie 's mad creation . She had piled up coral rocks and studded them with tacky Florida souvenirs , then set a bronze manatee on its tail . The sea cow 's hippo-like mouth spurted water into a pond where fat carp wove among purple swamp lilies . Jack could hear the splash of water as he took the path under the trellis . It blocked the rain , and intermittent drops spattered onto the keystone . Jack swept a spider web off his face . Then he saw ita man 's legs and feet . White canvas deck shoes with leather laces . Khaki pants , soiled with dirt and bits of rotten leaves . The rest of the man lay just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jack knew already , but called out , " Wake up ! " Drops of water fell from the trellis onto a philodendron leaf , which moved slightly , as if shuddering . Buddy whined through his nose . Jack pointed toward the house . " Go home ! " The dog circled , panting and wagging his tail . Walking closer , Jack felt a sharp crunch under his shoea snail , smashed like a tiny brown porcelain cup . Slime trails crisscrossed the path . Standing alongside the man 's thighs , Jack slowly peered around the huge leaves of the philodendron , holding the edge of one to pull it aside . He saw the other armmuscled , golden-hairedand at the end of it a hand covered in blood . The shattered bones of the wrist gleamed purplish through the skin . Without his volition , Jack 's eyes traveled upward , quickly taking in details that mounted in horrific impact . A torso in a white knit shirt , neat little red holes in it . And so much blood . Not on the shirt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red , and streaks of it ran into the man 's ear and matted his hair . One blue eye gazed upward . The other was a pulpy mass of glimmering black . It seemed to be moving . Then Jack saw the ants . Swarms of them . " Oh , sweet Jesus , " he moaned , letting go of the leaf , which gaily bobbed and dipped . Hands on knees , he waited for the dizziness to pass , then stood up . " Buddy , come ! " His voice cracked . Walking slowly through the rain , he gathered his thoughts . Water dripped off his eyebrows and chin , and his T-shirt clung to his back . Diane was on the porch . She pulled open the screen door , and her eyes took him in , finding the answer . She whispered , " He 's dead , is n't he ? " Jack went inside , shaking his head when she asked who it was . He grabbed a dishtowel and ran it over his face and neck . The smell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . Nikki sat at the table , green eyes open wide . Jack absently smoothed his mustache and stared across the kitchen . Diane spoke again . " Jack ? Who is it ? " He beckoned to Nikki . " Come with me into the study for a sec . Diane , be a good girl and tidy up the back porch , will you ? Do n't go anywhere . I wo n't be long . " He took Nikki down the hall , their footsteps reduced to soft thuds on an ancient oriental carpet gone to threads at the edges . The house was too cold . He had turned the air conditioner down to sixty-something before Nikki had slid into bed , giggling . In the study , gray light filtered through wooden blinds . " What is going on , Jack ? Say something . What happened out there ? Somebody died ? " Her glossy pink mouth was open . He set his hands firmly on her shoulders . " I want you to be very calm . Can you do that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been shot . " She stared , then blinked . " Roger ? Roger is ... dead ? " She dropped onto the sofa . " Oh , my God . " He sat beside her . " This is a mess , baby . "
