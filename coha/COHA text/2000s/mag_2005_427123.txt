GETTING STEVEN SPIELBERG 'S MUNICH-A HOT-BUTTON THRILLER ABOUT TERRORISM-TO SCREEN WAS AN OLYMPIC CHALLENGE BY NEIL DRUMMING // NOTHlNG EVER HAPPENS IN MY PLAYS , " SAYS TONY KUSHNER . " PEOPLE KIT AROUND AND TALK . " The Puliteer Prize-winning playwright is doing just that , sipping chocolate-caramel tea and trying to offer some reasonable explanation as to why , nearly two years ago , he begged off rewriting a screenplay for the most powerful director in Hollywood. * Steven Spielberg was looking for someone to polish up an adaptation of Vengeance , George Jonas ' book about Israel 's secret operations to assassinate the masterminds of the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre . Spielberg " s producing partner , Kathleen Kennedy ( E.T. , Jurassic Park ) , suggested Kushner , who in addition to the Pulitzer had won two Tonys , in 1993 and 1994 , for Angels in America , the aprawHng Broadway epic tackling Reagan-era politics and the AIDS epidemic . ( A 2003 HBO adaptation of Angels racked up 11 Emmys , ) * " I thought that he would really appreciate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Kennedy , but " he was unavailable . " Well , that , and Kuahner , who had never written a screenplay before , let alone a thriller , was nervous about taking the gig . " People are chasing other people down the street , blowing people up in beds , scaling fences , and all these butch things that I 'd never written about , " Kushner says sitting in his high-rise Manhattan apartment . " I never kilted anybody in a play before-I mean , there 's one character in one play who is maybe dead and is n't necessarily dead . Other than that , I had never written " So-and-so shoots someone . " " Still , Spielberg prevailed upon Kushner to look over an earlier draft by Eric Roth ( Forrest Gwmp ) and try writing a few scenes . The director loved the new pages and Kuahner gave in . Within Eve weeks he had taken his first pass at Munich , Steven Spielbeins next Big Important Movie-and possibly a polarizing one as well . Munich ( due in theaters Dec. 23 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that escalated the Middle East crisis . It explores the definition and rationalization of terrorism at a time when the word hangs shadowlike over the entire world . Perhaps most controversially , it is a story about Jews hunting Palestinians directed by a Jew . " Spielberg 's clearly a very famous Jewish man , " says Kennedy , who also execproduced Schindler 's List , another Jewishthemed film that raised eyebrows in 1993 over questions of historical accuracy . " Teople are going to make assumptions that he 's going to come at this subject with a singular point of view . " But in recruiting Rushner , a Jew whose speeches and essays have sometimes challenged the arguments of proIsraeli hardliners , Spielberg was clearly looking for a more nuanced approach . JONAS ' VENGEANCE TELLS THE story of Avner , an Israeli secretservice agent who , after 11 Israeli athletes are taken hostage and murdered at the Munich Olympics by a PLO faction , is personally appointed by then prime minister Golda Meir to fall those who orchestrated the massacre . He and his team of idiosyncratic undercover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ targets . The book , though largely based on the hotly contested testimony of an anonymous source , is filled with the kind of pulse-racing action that lends itself to big-screen treatment . But when Kennedy first brought Spielberg the property , he too was skittish . " He was intrigued but said , " Let 's see how the development goes . I do nt want to make any commitment until I see the script , ' ' " she says . It was n't until he met Kushner that Spielberg felt he 'd found a collaborator with the right balance of sensitivity and knowledge about the subject matter . " He had an instinct that if you 're going to do a political film , " says Kushner , " it actually has to be about something that is genuinely political in the moment , that addresses issues that people care about on several sides , that it 's not " safe . " I think that he also felt he did n't know what all of those issues were . I 've been politically active and involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain degree of familiarity . We began a dialogue , and that continued through the film . That 's why I was on the set as much as I was . " The film ( which cost a reported $70 million ) was shot over a period of three months last Hummer in Malta , Hungary , Prance , and New York-an abbreviated schedule , but not too hectic by Spielberg 's standards . " First day of principal photography was when War of the . Worlds opened , " says Eric Bana , who plays Avner . " It was dear that there was going to be no discussion about that movie . The outside world did n't exist for us . It was game on . " " Almost all of Steven 's movies fall within anywhere from 56 to 75 days , " says Kennedy . " For certain movies , he needs to create a sense of urgency , intensity , and energy because he believes-and I think he may be right-that it translates on the screen . " As a newcomer , Kushner had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the set 98 percent of the time , " says Bana ( The Hulk ) . " Anytime there was a discussion about script , Tony would be involved . Steven 's the boss , obviously , but Tony 's opinion was always sought . " Adds Daniel Craig ( a.k.a. the next James Bond ) , who plays Avner 's fellow hitman , " Even when it was n't about the script , any question at all , I just had to go and chat with him . It 's not necessarily about what was written on the page , but what was in Tony 's mind when he was writing it . " What was in Kushner 's mind was ultimately more about people than polities . Mostly , he focused on fleshing out the five men as they go from nervous patriots to steely assassins . Avner begins as a softspoken man who wants to serve his country and come home to his wife . But his convictions weaken as the death toll increases . " We see him coming to terras with what he 's become , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been any good in that . " And Munich explores more than just the Israeli agents ' ideology . One of the first scenes that Kushner wrote for Spielberg was a calm but crackling exchange between Avner and a young PLO guard . The moment , which gives fair voice to Palestinian nationalism , delighted Spielberg and made it into the final cut of the movie virtually unchanged . " One of the things that people make a terrible mistake with in terms of thinking about the Middle East conflict is to think about it in terms of a clash of religions-Jew versus Muslim , " says Kushner . " It really is not about that . It 's about geography , about home . In the same way , you can misunderstand what happened in 9/11 as being a clash of Judeo-Christian civilization versus Muslim . There 's a lot more going on . Behind Muslim fundamentalism , there 's a history of colonialthought about intelligently . " Between Israel supporters already wincing at such gestures of empathy , Palestinian sympathizers opposed to Spielberg 's pro-Israel stance , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no wonder Spielberg brought in professional crisis manager Allan Mayer to advise him during Munich 's release . " I Kennedy , but she confirms that Mayer-who has done spin control for Halle Berry and R. Kelly-is around to help with " marketing . " Spieiberg and Co. also settled on a policy of limited promotion . " When we started shooting , " says Kennedy , " we realized that no matter what , Steven directing this subject was going to create a lot of speculation . So we just said , " We 're going to move quickly on getting the movie made , and even faster to get it finished and out there , because the best thing for the movie is just to let it speak for itself . " ' Munich has attracted healthy attention from critics ' groups , and won Golden Globe nominations for its direction and screenplay .

" Aside from being one of the film 's many surprisingly touching moments between the hitmen , the line is also an example of art imitating Kushner . " The long night shoots were sort of punishing , " he aays , reflecting on his Brat major Hollywood experience . " It got chilly . I wanted to go home . You ca n't read because the minute you open a book everybody comes by and says , " What are you reading ? " There 's a lot of sitting around and doing small talk , which some people clearly love . I do n't . I tried desperately not to gain too much weight because you just eat constantly . I was certainly relieved when it was done . " But then he smiles and adds , " I also miss it .
