From Squandered Victory : // The American occupation of Iraq was slipping into a new phase of crisis and violence that it would never overcome . But none of this should have come as a surprise ; coalition figures had been pleading for months for action against Muqtada al-Sadr , and against other militias as well . On the morning of March 31 , I visited one of Sadr 's most bitter and effective enemies , a moderate Shiite cleric , Sayyid Farqad al-Qizwini , who was preaching the compatibility of Islam and democracy , indeed the necessity of democracy for Islam . // In the days before my visit , Sadr 's organization had been widely distributing a leaflet denouncing Qizwini and his leading supporters as " pigs and dogs " who had defiled Islam and needed to be " stopped and silenced . " Qizwini had been living under threat of assassination for months , but now this pseudo-religious call for his murder had raised the stakes . // Qizwini implored the United States to act immediately . " These militias will turn Iraq into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he told me . " Any decision to dissolve the militias should be implemented in the next week . " At that moment , I thought Qizwini 's statement a bit hyperbolic in its urgency . But I did not realize that the dam was just about to burst , and that this dramatic day would essentially mark the end of my involvement with the American occupation . //
