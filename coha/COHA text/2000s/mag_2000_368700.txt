NETPLIANCE I-OPENER Targeted at senior citizens , the $299 device 's main appeal is its ease of use . You can surf the Web via a flat 10-in. screen , but what you really get with the $21.95-a-month fee is ready-to-read content from sources like ESPN and Mr. Showbiz . It quietly goes online three times a day to check your mail and news so you can catch up without tying up the phone . Coming soon is an instant-messaging function . Finally , you 'll be able to show Grandma the true meaning of chat . <P> COMPAQ IPAQ Part of the MSN Companion family , this is one of the sturdier ( and costlier ) Net appliances : $199 with a $790 , 36-month commitment to MSN . You 'll have no trouble typing on the wireless mini-keyboard , and the 10-in. monitor is crisp and easy to read . The downside is that if you 're not online , it functions as nothing more than a digital picture frame . At least you get to choose the photo . <P> CIDCO MAILSTATION While this little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and $9.99-a- month service fee ) is one of the lowest in the class . It will automatically download mail and Yahoo content like weather and news , so you do n't have to wait for updates . Not exactly portable , but at least easily movable , it runs on AA batteries when unplugged . <P> NADAPC ICEBOX More entertainment appliance than Internet power tool , it comes free with a $790 , 36-month subscription to NadaPC 's dial-up service . Features include a wireless keyboard that looks cool but is n't so easy to use , plus a DVD/CD player . If you do n't like watching Casablanca on the too-small , 9-in. screen , it 's easy to hook up the machine to your TV . <P>  --  By Wilson Rothman
