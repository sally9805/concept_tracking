<p> HOUSTON  --  Matt Murton 's ninth-inning home run sent the game into extra innings , so it was only fitting the Cubs left fielder finally ended things nine innings later . <p> Murton 's clutch two-run , two-out single gave the Cubs an 8-6 victory over the Houston Astros in 18 innings Tuesday night ( and Wednesday morning ) at Minute Maid Park . The game took five hours and 36 minutes . <p> Cubs manager Dusty Baker used every member of his 25-man roster in the game  --  the first time that 's happened in a non-expanded roster situation since a suspended game during the 1986 season . <p> Ten of those players pitched , including winner Rich Hill ( 3-5 ) , who was scheduled to start today 's series finale . The Cubs likely will have to make a roster move before today 's game to bring up a starter . <p> Carlos Zambrano and Carlos Marmol were used as pinch hitters , and catcher Michael Barrett  --  who supposedly had the night " off "  --  ended up catching 10 innings after pinch- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cubs ' longest game by innings since they played 18 innings on Aug. 6 , 1989 , at Pittsburgh . It was their longest game by time since June 30 , 2000 , when their game at Milwaukee lasted 5:31 . <p> It was the longest regular-season game ( by innings and time ) in Minute Maid Park history , surpassing a 14-inning affair between the Astros and Dodgers earlier this season . <p> The game was so long the starts of Roger Clemens and Juan Mateo were distant memories by the time the game ended . <p> The Cubs took a 5-2 lead over Clemens in the fifth . It also assured Clemens his worst outing of the season  --  he 'd given up no more than three earned runs in any of his previous 10 starts  --  and took the life out of the crowd of 41,531 . <p> To add injury to the insult , Mateo then plunked Clemens with one out in the bottom of the fifth . With Mateo due to bat third in the sixth , nearly everyone in the ballpark was interested to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never got the chance . With two outs and none on , Baker sent Ryan Theriot to the plate to pinch hit for Mateo  --  even though the rookie right-hander had thrown just 78 pitches to that point and had surrendered just two runs on four hits  --  and the crowd booed loudly . <p> The first pitch to Theriot was inside and the next Clemens offering hit him . At that point , home plate umpire Jeff Kellogg issued warnings to both benches . <p> Mateo was making just his second career start , so it was hard to argue with the decision to lift him after five . <p> jjackson@suntimes.com <p> CUBS RECAP : <p> CUBS AB R H BI BB SO Avg . <p> Pierre cf 8 1 1 0 1 1 .280 <p> Izturis ss 8 0 4 1 0 0 .259 <p> Pagan lf 3 1 0 0 1 0 .290 <p> Eyre p 0 0 0 0 0 0 .000 <p> Howry p 0 0 0 0 0 0 1.000 <p> d-Nevin ph 1 0 0 0 0 1 .252 <p> Novoa p 0 0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0 0 0 0 .256 <p> Guzman p 0 0 0 0 0 0 .143 <p> h-CZambrano ph 1 0 0 0 0 0 .170 <p> Dempster p 0 0 0 0 0 0 .000 <p> i-Marmol ph 1 0 0 0 0 1 .238 <p> RHill p 0 0 0 0 0 0 .083 <p> ARamirez 3b 8 2 3 0 0 3 .281 <p> JJones rf 7 2 2 3 0 2 .277 <p> Mabry 1b 8 0 1 0 0 3 .221 <p> Cedeno 2b 7 1 1 1 0 0 .252 <p> HBlanco c 3 0 1 0 0 0 .252 <p> c-Barrett ph-c 4 0 1 0 1 0 .325 <p> Mateo p 1 0 0 0 0 0 .000 <p> a-Theriot ph 0 0 0 0 0 0 .360 <p> Ohman p 0 0 0 0 0 0 1.000 <p> Wuertz p 0 0 0 0 0 0  --  <p> Aardsma p 0 0 0 0 0 0 .000 <p> Murton lf 5 1 2 3 0 1 .296 <p> Totals 66 8 16 8 3 12 <p> Houston AB R H BI BB SO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 .270 <p> Biggio 2b 4 0 0 0 0 0 .264 <p> Burke 2b 4 0 3 0 0 0 .284 <p> Lamb 1b 4 1 1 0 0 1 .313 <p> Wheeler p 0 0 0 0 0 0  --  <p> Lidge p 0 0 0 0 0 0  --  <p> TreMiller p 0 0 0 0 0 0  --  <p> Springer p 0 0 0 0 0 0  --  <p> e-Ensberg ph-3b 4 0 0 0 1 1 .236 <p> Berkman rf-1b-lf 6 1 0 0 2 3 .319 <p> Scott lf 5 1 3 0 1 0 .433 <p> Borkowski p 2 0 0 0 0 0 .000 <p> Huff 3b 5 1 3 2 0 0 .267 <p> Nieve p 0 0 0 0 0 0 .125 <p> g-Munson ph-1b 3 0 1 0 0 2 .206 <p> AEverett ss 7 1 1 2 0 1 .239 <p> Ausmus c 6 1 2 0 2 0 .229 <p> Clemens p 1 0 0 0 0 0 .000 <p> b-OPalmeiro ph 1 0 1 2 0 0 .229 <p> Qualls p 0 0 0 0 0 0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .209 <p> Totals 66 6 16 6 6 12 <p> CUBS 110 030 001 000 000 002  --  8 16 0 <p> Houston 000 204 000 000 000 000  --  6 16 0 <p> a-was hit by pitch for Mateo in the 6th. b-doubled for Clemens in the 6th. c-flied out for Blanco in the 8th. d-struck out for Howry in the 9th. e-flied out for Springer in the 10th. f-grounded into double play for Novoa in the 11th. g-struck out for Nieve in the 12th. h-grounded into double play for Guzman in the 14th. i-struck out for Dempster in the 17th . <p> LOB  --  CUBS 11 , Houston 15. 2B  --  ARamirez ( 25 ) , Burke ( 19 ) , Huff ( 5 ) , Ausmus ( 13 ) , OPalmeiro ( 4 ) . 3B  --  Pierre ( 10 ) , AEverett ( 4 ) .
