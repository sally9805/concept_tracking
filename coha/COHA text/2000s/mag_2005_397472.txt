Section : Health <p> Section : GENOMICS What genetic researchers used to call junk DNA may conceal the most important medical secrets of all . <p> When Researchers Began mapping the genome , aiming to decode the entire human gene sequence , they expected to eventually locate 100,000 or more active genes . After completing the genome map in 2001 , they were startled to find that humans have only 25,000 active genes . The lowly roundworm has almost as many ( 19,000 ) . <p> That means the active genes contain a mere 1.5% of the 3 billion units of DNA that make up our genetic structure . The rest is " dark " or " junk " DNA , long presumed to be present for no particular reason . <p> But researchers are now finding this junk DNA , overlooked for decades by geneticists , may actually not be junk at all . They are finding hints of an enormous and previously unimagined command-and-control apparatus that regulates what our 25,000 genes do and how the body is assembled . Junk DNA , when it goes wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer to diabetes to infectious disease . <p> That insight could unearth hundreds of new targets for experimental drugs that had been aimed only at working genes . " It 's sort of like Antiques Roadshow , " says Harvard genome scientist John Quackenbush , who has long argued that the junk DNA could be vital . " You look in the closet full of junk and find out you have a Picasso . " <p> " This will revolutionize human genetics over the next few decades , " says David Haussler , a Howard Hughes investigator at UC , Santa Cruz who was on the government team that decoded the human genome . He predicts that most disease-causing genetic flaws will be found lurking in our junk DNA . <p> The dark DNA " may be even more important " than active genes in causing disease , says Isaac Bentwich , chairman of Israel 's Rosetta Genomics . Founded in 2000 , Rosetta has applied for patents on 200 dark genes . He hopes for new treatments and diagnostic tools for lung cancer , prostate cancer and other diseases . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a promising target discovered in the sea of junk DNA only five years ago . MicroRNAs essentially quell a gene 's workings , and they already have been linked to diabetes , hepatitis C , leukemia , lymphoma and breast cancer . <p> " It 's a revolution in how we understand the genome and how the cell functions , " says MIT Nobel laureate Phillip Sharp . " There 's a whole new frontier there . " Sharp and a few microRNA researchers have founded Alnylam Pharmaceuticals to invent RNA-based drugs to treat Parkinson 's , cystic fibrosis and spinal injury . The firm has development deals with Merck and Novartis , and such rivals as San Francisco 's Sirna Therapeutics are in pursuit . <p> The new view of junk DNA overturns 50 years of dogma in molecular biology . James Watson and Francis Crick discovered DNA 's structure in 1953 . The double-helix , twisted ladder of chemical base pairs is carried on the 23 pairs of chromosomes that inhabit every cell in the body . The human genome contains 3 billion base pairs ( or " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can span thousands of base pairs . <p> For decades scientists have zoomed in on the active genes that carry instructions for making hundreds of thousands of proteins ; this protein production is carried out by DNA 's doppelgnger , RNA . The dark genes were dismissed as debris left over from millions of years of evolution . <p> Now that junk-DNA theory looks to be.junk . Huge expanses of dark DNA are nearly identical in numerous species , from flies to rats to humans . That nature has conserved the dark stuff for millions of years is a clear indication that it must do something crucial , biologists say . <p> Some say that the dark DNA that plays a crucial role in the body could occupy at least 4% of the genome  --  almost three times the portion taken up by active genes . A better guess is that a huge 40% to 70% of the whole DNA sequence is dark DNA with secret powers , posits Peter Andolfatto , a fruit-fly geneticist at UC , San Diego . <p> An early hint that junk DNA might hold treasures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School studied a mysterious genetic mutation in worms that prevented them from maturing from the larva stage to adult . To his astonishment , he found that the mutation existed not in active genes but in dark DNA that controlled a tiny strand of RNA , the first microRNA whose main function was to turn off another gene . <p> The result remained an isolated curiosity until 2000 , when Harvard Medical School geneticist Gary Ruvkun found a second microRNA in worms and showed it also was present in people . That suggested there might be a whole realm of mysterious and undetected RNA master controllers inside cells . Soon several supercomputers tried tracking them down  --  and quickly found them , in abundance . Now researchers figure 300 to 1,000 human microRNAs form a hidden layer of control , helping determine which genes are turned off when . They may help regulate 30% or more of all proteins . <p> One , called microRNA 375 , can block insulin secretion and may be involved in diabetes . Another , microRNA 122 , is found in the liver and is used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could be a target for future drugs for the disease . " MicroRNAs are almost ideal drug targets . The field is exploding , " says Rockefeller University 's Markus Stoffel . He and colleagues at Alnylam recently created new RNA drugs that bind to and break down specific microRNAs . When they tested one such RNA drug in mice , cholesterol levels fell 44% . <p> MIT and Harvard researchers showed in June that 217 microRNAs were altered in a wide array of tumors . Ohio State University researchers , writing in the New England Journal of Medicine in October , found that levels of just 13 microRNAs predicted how quickly a common type of leukemia would progress . Moreover , of 75 patients studied , 11 patients with this leukemia had mutations in their microRNA that may have caused the disease . This was the first time such mutations had been found . " When I was giving talks about microRNAs three years ago , people thought I was from Mars , " says cancer geneticist Carlo Croce , who led the research . <p> But even microRNA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a tiny fraction of junk DNA . What the rest does is still mostly a mystery , but almost certainly it is doing something . Many areas of the genome previously thought to be barren actually are churning out huge quantities of RNA , chipmaker Affymetrix has found . There may be hundreds of thousands of RNA molecules of various kinds that boss around our genes , says Affymetrix research director Thomas Gingeras . <p> Even dark DNA that does n't ever transform into microRNA or a protein-coding active gene may have crucial functions . A recent study examined a three-year-old Japanese girl with a DNA mutation that caused her to have two thumbs on each hand and seven toes on each foot . The mutation turned out to be in the junk DNA . Astoundingly , the junk DNA mutation somehow had disrupted the function of a distant development gene that lies a million DNA letters away . All Jammed Up <p> Old dogma held that DNA was merely a recipe book for proteins . MicroRNAs show that it can work in previously unimagined ways . Here is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into an RNA message that is sent into the cell . The RNA message is read by a molecular factory called a ribosome , which uses it as a blueprint to produce a protein . But it turns out that DNA also makes various tiny microRNAs ; these also drift out into cells . When a microRNA binds to a specific RNA message , it gums up protein production . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Harvard 's John Quackenbush has long argued that junk DNA matters . <p> DIAGRAM <p> DIAGRAM <p> DIAGRAM <p> DIAGRAM <p> By Matthew Herper and Robert Langreth <p>
