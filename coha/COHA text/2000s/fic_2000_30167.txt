Say , Say , Say Mama say I 'm grown now because I got Imani . She say Imani all mine . I know she all mine , and I like it just like that , not having to share my baby with no one . Imani even look like me . I know she do , got my nose on her face , and my lips , my hands . Her fingers shaped just like mine , wide and flat . I do n't care what nobody say , who they say they might see in her . It 's only me in her . When I be getting up with her at night , it be my own face looking back at me . I want to be mad at her because it be two o'clock in the morning . Imani so little she do n't know when it 's a weekend , and I ai n't got to get up and go nowhere . She do n't know when it 's a weekday , and I be having to get up and go to school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to get there a whole hour earlier than I had to get to middle school . But I do n't be mad at Imani when I look her in the face and see me . I be smiling at her . Real quick I go to her , because Mama done told me she do n't want to hear Imani crying . She say she going to get me if she cry too much . Even though I done had her just five months , I got things down right . It 's what you call a routine . Before Imani can let out one good scream , my feet be on the floor . Sometimes it seem I still be sleep , but I go pick her up from her crib . She still light , like a doll or a puppy . It seem like she was heavier when she was inside my stomach . I press her face against my shoulder and take her downstairs to fix her bottle . Imani a good baby . A real good baby . She know she got to be quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she hush right up . She do n't want to see me get in no trouble . While the bottle heat up , I walk with her around the kitchen . She like that . It 's like she even know the routine . We walk around in the dark kitchen with that tiny blue flame dancing under the pot on the stove . I take her in the living room and punch on the TV . There do n't be nothing on . Our cable done been cut off . Even our illegal cable that June Bug had climbed up the pole and hooked up for us . One day last year I was coming home from school and seen this white man from the cable company up on a pole cutting wires left and right . Some of our neighbors was peeping out they curtains . But they ai n't come out . Not even June Bug . I seen him like a shadow pressed inside his screen door , watching that cable man cut down the pair of sneakers that was hanging on the wires in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave and he went and got them sneakers and tied them back together . I heard this boy on the bus say once drug dealers be hanging up sneakers in front of they houses . That sound stupid to me . Like they advertising . Everybody know June Bug sell drugs . He do n't need no sneakers announcing it . Me and Mama was sitting out on the front porch , watching him and not watching him . We was drinking us some good sweet and cold Kool-Aid and eating salt-and-vinegar potato chips . June Bug kept tossing them sneakers . Seem like he had two wounded gray and nasty-looking birds folded up in his hands . Trying to get them back up into the sky . He threw them up about ten times and they come crashing back to the ground . This little cockeye boy that live down at the corner with his grandma come running up the street and say he could toss them sneakers up there . I thought he going to clunk hisself in the head . But he got them sneakers up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self . June Bug say , You all right little man . In a few years I 'm going to have you working for me . He give that boy some money , and that boy went racing back down the street . Mama say it was a shame , because June Bug the one got that boy mama all strung out in the first place on that stuff . That 's how come he living with his grandma in the second place . I ai n't say nothing about them . I ask Mama about the cable . She say , What you want me to do ? I 'm sick of this shit . That 's the second time they done come and cut the cable . I say , You can pay the bill . Mama say , If I had money to pay the goddamn bill in the first place , we would n't have to bootleg . When I told Mama maybe we could get June Bug to go back up the pole , she roll her eyes at me and suck her teeth . Huh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn twenty dollars for nobody to go up no pole to turn around and ai n't got no service . We watching whatever come on for free . So when I be watching our old boring stone-age TV at night with Imani , ai n't even no point in turning on the sound . The light help keep me awake while Imani nurse . She be greedy at first , like she ai n't had a bottle in years . Maybe it seem like years to her . Sometimes I do n't know all what 's inside her head , what she understand . I go to this class , though . It teach you more about a baby . My middle school counselor signed me up for it last spring after Imani was born and got her in the daycare . I like that . Having her close by all day . Knowing she just down on the first floor with the other babies . Mama say when she went to school , there was n't no classes like them . There was n't no nurseries in high schools . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of your baby the best way you knew how . Mama say me and the other girls is spoiled . That is all . Plain and simple . We got things too easy . Most of the girls who got babies in the nursery take the class . They even got girls in there that is going to have babies . My friend Eboni going to have a baby . She barely seven months , but she look like she about ready to deliver . Me and Eboni sit together . Our seats right in the front of the room , and we do n't like the teacher , Mrs. Poole . Her breath stink , flat out . That should n't make you not like a person , but it sure make them hard to listen to , especially when they be all up in your face . Mrs. Poole like that ; she be all up in your face telling you how to wipe shit off a baby butt , and you can really imagine doing it because her breath smell like some shit you ca n't just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one told me about " establishing a routine " with Imani . She say babies like routines . They act better if they know what to expect . I believe that 's true about Imani . She so smart , she learned her routine quick . But I do n't know if all Mrs. Poole say true . Maybe it 's because I be half-listening , because I 'm trying to dodge her breath . Like she say , a baby bond with you , a baby bond with its mother . Mrs. Poole say a baby ai n't born loving its mother . I swear that 's what she say last week . I ask Eboni after school was that what she say , and Eboni say it was . Mrs. Poole say you got to teach a baby to love you . Now , I think that ai n't even true . Imani was born loving me . The crazy thing was , I was n't loving Imani all along . Loving her every minute because I was scared . Mama thought I was hiding Imani from her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only knew part of the truth . I was hiding her from myself . I did n't even know she was there inside my stomach until I missed my fourth period . Eboni say she knew before I even told her . We was in the same gym class , and Eboni say she could see my stomach growing . When I told her one day after gym was over , Eboni say she thought it might not be too late to get rid of it . Get rid of it ? I ai n't like the way that sound , like the baby was just going to be throwed out . I ai n't want that and told Eboni so . She ask , What you want then ? To give it away ? I shook my head . Eboni put her arms around me , and you 'd think that 'd be enough to stop me from getting upset . But I went crazy crying and could n't stop . The gym teacher come in and say I could go to the nurse , but I ai n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right at me and see I had a baby in me . Then she 'd tell Mama . Then I 'd get beat . My gym teacher let me and Eboni go in her office and stay there up until the next bell . She wrote a note saying I was hit in the head with a ball and was laying down for a period . I do n't know what she wrote for Eboni . I was n't crying no more when the bell rang . Was n't no more tears . Eboni promised she would n't tell nobody , but she say I had to tell Mama . But I say I could n't and she knew I could n't . Mama 'd say I been doing nasty things with boys . I 'm not nasty . Sometimes I think Imani had a routine before she even come out of me . Every night she 'd wake me up at just about this same time . She 'd be moving around . I would hold my breath , keeping real still until she stopped . I was stupid enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and come right on out me . Maybe she just wanted to remind me she was in there , because I was doing my best to forget . Carrying her mostly through winter and into a Buffalo spring that 's just like winter , I wore these big sweats . It was n't hard to keep her a secret . My stomach never really poked out much , anyway . I just kept getting fatter from eating so much . I do n't really like Mama 's cooking , but I do n't say that to her , because she 'll say I 'm ungrateful for all she do for me , and slap me . Mostly when I was carrying Imani , I 'd go to Eboni 's after school . Her mama , Miss Lovey , a good cook . I think Eboni told her about the baby . I ai n't saying Eboni is the kind of loud-mouth girl who tell all your business . She ai n't like one of them girls on the bus . You give them a bone on the way to school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed it to every bitch they know and they all trying to get a lick off it . Miss Lovey ai n't say nothing to me . She just pile my plate up real high with food , with liver and onions , lasagna loaded up with them hot Italian sausage , and her greens . They the best . She rinse her greens real good . Do n't be nam grain of sand in them , and she cook them with two kinds of meat , ham hocks and bacon , and she season them just right , with hot sauce and vinegar . Thinking about them even now make my stomach flip . Miss Lovey ai n't never ask me nothing about me having a baby . She would push a extra biscuit on my plate , pour me a big glass of buttermilk , slip a piece of fat meat on my plate she know I like . Sometimes she 'd look at me with that look adults have , the one where they know you got a secret and they want you to tell them so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hand or rub your back while you spill your guts out to them . I looked right back at Miss Lovey when she looked at me like that . I give her that **30;580;TOOLONG look , but I ai n't going to say it . Why I got to say it when she already know what it was ? Mama ai n't even know about Imani until one morning when I ai n't get up for school on time . I was all tired because Imani had kept me up kicking and moving around all night . I guess she was tired of being in me . And these cramps was pinching in my back . They was soft at first like my period was coming , but then they got harder . I finally took me three aspirins real late . I only got a hour of sleep by the time the alarm went off . It 's right by my bed , so I shut it off , but I did n't get up . I should 've like I do now with the routine . I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without me . It seem like I just closed my eyes when I heard Mama up . I looked at the clock . It was five minutes before the bus come . I thought I could make it if I wore the sweats I slept in and just wiped a rag over my face and run out the door . But my sweats was too funky so I started to change them when Mama opened my room door . I was standing there in my drawers . I did n't even have my bra on yet . I ai n't say nothing . I ai n't have to . My titties say it . They was as big as watermelons . My stomach say it . It was all stretched wide , spread out around my body . I know I looked ugly , even though I ai n't looked at myself in a mirror in a long time . Not even on my birthday , the month before . I was fifteen on my birthday . I was n't all that excited about turning fifteen . Fourteen neither . Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned thirteen and I was finally a teenager . They always be having them articles in Seventeen about how great it is to be old enough to wear makeup , how to dress for the prom , what twenty pieces of clothes you got to have to go back to school in the fall , how to tell if a boy like you . I ai n't think I was going to look like them girls in there , all skinny and all , but I did think I might feel like them . Happy . And I was . We had a ice cream cake and subs delivered . Mama got me a card . The card say something about being a teenager now . It was a joke card with a white girl on the front talking on the phone , and a corny rhyme inside . I was n't expecting nothing for my birthday this year . Mama just give me money last year , twenty dollars in my hand . So I was n't looking forward to nothing great this year . What 's so special about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Mama hitting the number . She did the Pick Four on my birth date . Month and year . Mama give me a real nice birthday . I would 've liked it if she 'd just turned the cable back on . But Mama went all out for me . She got me ice cream and a cake , a real bakery cake with candles on it . She let Eboni come over . We ordered a bucket of Buffalo wings and pizza with anything I wanted on it . I got double cheese , ham , pepperoni , and hot sausage . Miss Odetta come over , too . She June Bug mama . Eboni give me these gold earrings with my name on them . They not real gold . They that fake gold them Arabians be selling down in the Main Place Mall . The earrings nice , though . They ai n't turn my ears green or make break out or nothing . Miss Odetta give me a card with twenty dollars in it . Mama give me a new pair of sneakers . Nikes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she got them hot . I ai n't ask . I needed some new kicks . My feet been growing , so I 'm glad to have them . Mama give me a card , too . It had a black mama and girl on the front . The girl was little , sitting in her mama lap . On the front of the card was To my darling , beautiful daughter on her birthday . On the inside it did n't rhyme . It say , May all the joy in the world be with you on this very special day . It was signed Mama . I closed it real quick and stuffed it in my sneakers . Before I went to bed that night , I laced up my sneakers so I could show them off at school the next day . Then I did something I should n't have . I opened the card from Mama and read it again . I started crazy crying again , like I did that day at school . That card was lying on me . I was n't none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to look at myself to know that , to know how ugly and broke-down I looked . All these stretch marks running crazy over me . For months they had been on my titties , on my stomach . It looked like I was going to crack open and something was going to come from inside me , not just the baby , but something else , like in a horror movie where there be monsters in people and they do n't even know it . I hated Mama for buying that stupid card . At the same time I wanted to go to her that night and tell her everything . I was just so sick of trying to hide my baby . I figured maybe her heart might be soft , with it still being my birthday . But when I got up , I felt Imani kick me . It seemed like she was saying for me to shut up . It 's not the right time . I could n't shut up , though . So I lay down and pushed my face deep in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these strange noises be coming out my mouth . They be coming from deep inside me from a place I do n't even know , from a place I do n't even want to know . I stayed right in my bed until I quieted down all by myself , until when I opened my mouth ai n't nothing come out but my breath . Who know , maybe I should 've told Mama that night . I should 've say something while my heart was soft , and maybe hers was soft , too . It would have been better that way , with me just saying it , flat out , instead of her seeing me like that the morning I was late for school . Mama ai n't say nothing . She just flew right at me and slapped me in the face . I was too clumsy and slow to get out the way of her hand . Next , she punched me right in the titties . I put my hands up so she could n't hit me no more , and I backed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions she ai n't even give me time to answer , and every time she ask one , she slapped me again . What the hell wrong with you ? What was you thinking about , doing this ? Why you throw your life away ? What you think your aunt going to think of you ? What am I going to tell her ? Why you ai n't tell me ? Why you ai n't tell me ? Why you ai n't tell me ? It was like Mama to think what I done was all about her , like I done something to her . I could n't hardly tell myself , but I could n't say that to Mama . That would n't make no sense to her , so I rolled over and put my back to her . I was n't thinking about her so much as I was thinking about my baby . I had to protect my baby . That 's why I think Mrs. Poole wrong with her stink breath . Because Imani loved me right then . I could feel it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born for her to love me . I ai n't have to wait for her to be born to love her . She my baby . Mama kept on asking and slapping . Who the father ? What nigger you had the baby with ? What 's his name ? I ai n't say nothing . I just curled myself up around my baby . I could n't say his name to Mama . I could n't even say it to myself . Finally she ask me , without a slap , You happy now ? Then she let me alone . She was n't getting nothing out of me . She left the room and I got up and dressed real quick . I 'd missed my school bus , but I could still take the city bus and not miss all of first period . I was relieved it was over , that Mama knew . She ai n't really hurt me . I just wanted to get to school . When I left the house , Mama was in her room . She ai n't even come out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably still sitting in there when the school nurse called her to tell her my water broke . I ai n't even know what it was . I was in my second-period math class with Mr. Crowley . He this white man who 's all sucked-up looking and he got these brown teeth all piled on top of each other . He do n't never leave the overhead projector where he be scribbling out problems and they solutions . I felt like I had to go to the bathroom real bad and I could hardly hold it . I was waving my hand real wild , but Mr. Crowley ai n't even look at me . He was explaining how to turn fractions into decimals and decimals into fractions . He finally called on me after I called out his name , and ask me to solve the problem . I told him I had to go to the lavatory , and you know what he had the nerve to tell me ? I could n't go . He had already give out two lavatory passes . I swear , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give two bathroom passes a period because he think we be trying to go to the bathroom just to miss class . Maybe that 's all right for boys , but do n't he know what girls be having to do in the lavatory sometimes ? Do n't he think we might need more than two passes during class ? I was n't stutting Mr. Crowley and his rules just then . I got up and headed for the door . Soon as I started walking , I was dripping . I could feel it . By the time I made it out the door , I was starting to gush , and the lavatory was way at the end of the hall . Mr. Crowley was right behind me . He seen it , too . My sweat pants was stained dark . I was so embarrassed . Mr. Crowley grabbed me by the shoulders and ask me if I was all right . I told him I want to go to the lavatory , but he say he was taking me to see the nurse . I think he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go , but I knew I should , so he walked with me leaning on him and told me everything would be fine , and I was thinking he was wishing he had just give me a lavatory pass when I ask for one . The nurse is this black lady . I had never even been in her office before , just past it . She called a ambulance . Then she phoned Mama and tell her to meet us at ECMC . That 's the county hospital . Some people do n't like it because it 's the welfare hospital , but it 's all right with me . I was born there . I was n't really even scared until I heard the ambulance come up with that siren going . I ai n't want to get in it , but the nurse say it was the best and safest way for me . She say she was going to be with me all the way . She was real calm . Her breath was even calm . It smelled like peppermint . She say she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to the hospital she sat next to me , patting my hand while the ambulance attendant ask me a bunch a questions about my prenatal care , how advanced my pregnancy was , when was my last period . I knew I ai n't give the right answers by the way he was frowning . The cramps I had the night before was back . They was harder and longer . The nurse told me to breathe , like I was n't breathing or something . She ask how bad the pain was . I told her it was n't that bad , and it was n't . Mama was there when I got to the hospital , looking real worried . I ai n't know if she was worried because she hit me that morning and she thought these people would find out about it , or if she was really worried about me . When they wheeled me past her , I looked in her face . It looked like she was really worried about me . It looked like she been crying . They took me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nothing but this sheet over me . Some nurse come in and give me a shot . This doctor come and stood over me . He was from some other country . I do n't know where , but he had a funny accent . He say they was going to take the baby out of me , just to be safe . I tell him I could take the pain , but he say they want to be safe . You 're just a child , he say to me . That 's all I remember until after Imani was born . I do n't know what they give me , but the next thing I know , it was dark outside and I was in this room with some other women with babies . Mama was sitting in a chair next to my bed , her arms folded on her chest , and she was staring at a television hung up on the wall . Jeopardy ! was on . Mama ai n't say nothing . She walked around the bed and took Imani out the little plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . I ai n't know what to do . I just stared at her , feeling how light she was , looking to see who was in her face . It was only me I seen there , and when she poked one of her hands out the blanket , I seen them flat fingers like mine . I smiled . Imani was n't even her name then . Not official . It say Dawson , Girl on her ankle band . Eboni had give me that name . She got this baby book from a black card shop and it had that name in it . She was picking out names after she found out she was having a baby . She told me what Imani mean in some African language . Faith . I liked that . It seem like Mama want to say something to me , but she ai n't know what to say . She say I could get some ice chips , but I ai n't want them . She say she needed to go home . She was tired . I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had Imani . Every time I go to Mrs. Poole class , I be learning more of what to do with Imani . I know that after the bottle , I got to burp her . Imani like that , I think . She like me patting her back . Her head be wobbling all around . I hold her head like Mrs. Poole say , but I think my baby just plain nosey . She be looking all around when I be burping her , even at two in the morning , like there 's something to see . Just last week when we was up , Imani was looking around when she heard these gunshots . Then she got real still . It was like she was holding her breath . I could n't feel no breath coming from her . All I could feel was her heart beating fast fast . Mrs. Poole done taught us how to do CPR , but all I could think to do was give her a good shake . I knew I ai n't need to when she turned and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a breath come out of her then . Hot and wet in my face . I heard the shots , too . We was on the couch , but I stopped right then patting her back and got down on the floor . I do n't even want to sound dramatic , like I dove down on the floor or something . They be shooting around here sometimes at night . But the shots sound like they did that night . Like they a few blocks over . They was still loud , so I slid off onto the floor . I ai n't want to scare Imani . Mrs. Poole would probably say I 'm crazy . Ai n't no way a baby know what gunshots is . I ai n't saying Imani knew , but that kind of scared me . After she let out a good burp , I laid Imani out on the floor and finished up the routine . I changed her diaper , wiped her off with one of them moist towelettes , and greased and powdered her butt . She got real pretty skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , and I 'm going see to it she do n't . Imani act like she still ai n't want to go to sleep that night . She was n't fussing or nothing , but I guess she was n't ready to go on off to sleep . So I laid down on the floor and put her up on my chest . Mrs. Poole say that can calm a baby down . The baby hear your heart beating like when they was inside you . So I put her on my heart and sung her this song me and Eboni used to sing when we was girls . It 's a hand-clapping song , but Imani ca n't do the clapping part yet , so I ai n't do the clapping part . I do n't know why I sung it , but it just come to my mind , and I sung it real soft . I sung it like a whisper . Say , Say , Say -- I am a pretty little Black girl As pretty as pretty can Be-e And all the boys around my block are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes from A-la-Bam-a With a pickle on his nose and a cherry on his toes That 's why my story goes .
