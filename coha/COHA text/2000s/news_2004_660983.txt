<p> During Peter Gerlach 's first meal with his new stepfamily , his teenage stepdaughter began chewing with her mouth open . So Mr. Gerlach decided to take advantage of his new authority as a stepdad and told her to close her mouth while she was eating . <p> The teenager turned to her mom . " Do I have to ? " she asked . <p> With that simple question , the girl - and her stepdad - set off a classic dispute in blended families with teenagers : She behaved in a manner that clashed with her stepfather 's values and then asked her mom to back her up . When her mom told her they 'd discuss the matter later , Gerlach felt resentful . <p> " Without a doubt , the adolescent years are the hardest time to form a stepfamily or to be at peace , " says Susan Wisdom , coauthor of " Stepcoupling " and a counselor in Portland , Ore. , who specializes in stepfamilies . <p> Discord is n't inevitable in blended families that include teens , but parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . These may be spurred not only by a clash of values , but also by strong loyalties that can pit different family members against one another . <p> Disputes also arise when teens begin trying to exert their independence , says Margorie Engel , president of the Stepfamily Association of America . <p> It 's critical for parents and stepparents to try to empathize with teens in stepfamilies , she adds . They did n't want their parents to split up , they may not really want to live with a parent 's new spouse , and they 're trying to strike out on their own , rather than embrace new family members . <p> " In our society , teen years are the time to begin separating from family so that teens are prepared for independence after high school , " says Ms. Engel . " When parents with teenagers marry and create a stepfamily , they inadvertently stall this developmental process ... by forcing combined activities , meals , and bedrooms to the detriment of privacy , one-on-one time with children , and time with peers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holden of Portland , Ore. , experienced such problems when she was 15 years old and her father remarried after her mother died . Because her father 's house was small , Ms. Holden , now an adult , had to share a room with a 15-year-old stepsister who had radically different tastes . In addition , she had acquired a stepbrother . <p> " It was so hard , " she says . " Here was this house I grew up in , and at times , I felt as if there was n't room for me in it . " <p> Respect and appreciation are key <p> Life would have been easier , Holden says , if her father and stepmother had provided a private bedroom for her and if she had felt more respected and appreciated by her new stepfamily members . Instead , she felt as if this new family was forced on her against her will . <p> Often this happens when adults in a stepfamily focus on forgetting the past and starting over , says Engel . She calls this " a misguided effort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and try to ignore the reality that teens also have loyalties and close relationships with a parent . " <p> Teenagers may show their feelings in ways that leave the stepparent feeling hurt and unappreciated , notes Kevin Ricker , a marriage counselor in Sylvania , Ohio , who raised four stepchildren . After he taught his stepson how to drive , he relates , " as we were coming back after he passed his driver 's test , he said , ' Can I borrow your car and show my dad I can drive ? ' He could n't wait to show his dad he could drive , even though his stepdad had taught him . " <p> At that moment , Mr. Ricker needed to remind himself of his stepson 's natural alliance with his father , he says . <p> Stepparents also need to understand that when there 's a conflict , the parent may reflexively favor his or her child 's point of view , notes Ricker . That can create family disagreements , especially if the teen 's values clash with the stepparent 's . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play video games in her house . His stepmom does n't like video games , and does n't want him to expose her younger children to them . The teen may solicit support from his dad , saying , " But I can do this at Mom 's house . " <p> In this case , the stepmom and father need to work out a compromise , notes Patricia Papernow , a psychologist in Hudson , Mass. , and author of " Becoming a Stepfamily . " They might decide to allow the teen to play his video games in a room where the stepmom 's children are n't exposed to them , for instance . <p> " The stepmother should tell the teen , ' We have two cultures here . Because you grew up in a different culture , you need to use the video games in a way that 's respectful to my kids , ' " suggests Dr. Papernow . <p> Debbie and Jay Dettmer of Ellicott City , Md. , found that respect was the key to struggling with values differences between their children 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , more strict than my husband 's ex , wanting to keep an eye on the girls and keep them out of trouble , " says Mrs. Dettmer , who has an 18-year-old daughter and an 18-year-old stepdaughter . <p> The Dettmers often worried about Mr. Dettmer 's daughter when she was visiting her mother . They hoped she would n't watch inappropriate movies or stay out too late . But they knew they could n't control what happened at his ex-wife 's house . <p> " Instead , we tried to be clear about what our expectations were here , " says Mrs. Dettmer . For example , when the girls learned to drive , she and her husband asked both girls to sign contracts that required them to call home whenever they drove somewhere . <p> As parents in stepfamilies work together to solve such problems , they should use language that allows adults and teens to talk comfortably about differences in values , says Mr. Gerlach , now a therapist in Oak Park , Ill. , who specializes in blended families . " They need to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> It 's good for families to create a culture that avoids angry confrontations , says Robert Klopfer , a clinical social worker in Ridgewood , N.J. " What 's most important is learning to talk to each other . Kids do n't feel good when people are angry at them . " <p> However , stepparents of teens do n't always find it easy to avoid anger or resentment . " When you are the stepparent and you are living with a kid who does n't look at you and makes faces at you behind the parent 's back , it really hurts . Teens are good at this , " says Papernow . <p> When stepparents find themselves feeling hurt and rejected by teenage stepchildren , they should be clear about their limits , says Karolyn Meador of Portland , Ore . <p> Her second husband had five teenagers when Mrs. Meador married him . It was tempting to try to buy the teens ' love , she says . <p> Every Christmas for many years , Meador and her husband took their family to a ski @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five stepchildren and her own two children . She prepared meals for the seven kids plus five of her stepchildren 's friends . <p> Mrs. Meador now realizes that because she wanted so much for her stepchildren to like her , she worked too hard at Christmas to make that happen . <p> Now that her children and stepchildren are adults , she sees that it was more important to simply earn their respect . " In order to get them to like me , I tried to act like a regular mom , " she says . " That should n't have been my role . " <p> The role of a stepparent <p> She suggests that stepparents define their roles in the family . " They should n't assume they have to do certain things to get the kids to like them more . " <p> Meador is proud of the fact that even though she 's no longer married to her second husband , she has a good relationship with all her stepchildren . And her children and stepchildren have remained friends . But those good relationships are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the stepchildren like her . <p> Another stumbling block for some stepparents is insisting on family time with teenagers . Often , teens are busy playing sports , taking dance classes , or visiting with friends . That can make finding family time difficult , especially if the teens split their time between Mom 's house and Dad 's house . <p> Lisa Daniel of Bethesda , Md. , says that when her stepdaughter , Mara , was a teenager , she generally spent six weeks each summer with Mrs. Daniel and her husband , Timothy . <p> When she was 15 , Mara was offered the opportunity to dance with American Ballet Theater 's summer program in New York , which would cut her visit to two weeks . Mr. and Mrs. Daniel decided the teen should pursue it , even though they would miss her . <p> " It 's a very tough balance to try to ensure enough family time to allow some kind of cohesion with a teen whom you do n't see much and to be responsive to the fact that they increasingly have lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrequent family time , values clashes , loyalty conflicts , and teens pushing for independence , life in some stepfamilies with teenagers can be emotionally charged and difficult . Mr. Ricker says the experience becomes easier if parents can accept the fact that stepfamilies are inherently different from nuclear families . <p> " Mother , father and stepchildren is a circle that is never closed , " he explains . " Kids are coming and going . You feel the influence of value systems from outside . You just do n't get the closure and control of the family that a nuclear family does .
