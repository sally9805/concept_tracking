Chapter One Sparks They sat close to each other on the sofa , Canavan aware of Mrs. Harris ' scent and her dark hair , parted to one side , she would hold away from her face to look at the map spread open on the coffee table . Canavan was showing her the areas destroyed by fire , explaining how the hot Santa Ana wind swept the flames through these canyons and on down toward the Pacific Coast Highway . Close to four thousand acres destroyed but only nine homes this time , including Mrs. Harris ' Mediterranean villa , here , at the top of Arroyo Verde . Nothing like five years ago when over two hundred homes were lost . He showed her photographs , too , fires raging against the night sky . Robin Harris said , " Yeah ... ? " looking at the photos but not showing any real interest . Canavan kept glancing at her , Robin a slim turn-on in a trendy kind of way : pale skin and heavy eyeliner , silver rings , designer-ripped jeans , barefoot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue steel , around her upper left arm , the one close to Canavan . The profile he had in his case file described her as the former Robin Marino : sang with a rock band that played L.A. clubs , produced one album , gave it up five years ago to marry Sid Harris : the legendary Sid Harris , lawyer to platinum-selling recording artists . Now a widow at thirty-seven , Robin was estimated to be worth around ten million . She had lost Sid to a coronary thrombosis , at home , only three months ago , Sid sixty-three when he died . And had lost the house in the Malibu hills three weeks ago , close to a million dollars ' worth of furniture and contents destroyed . But she had bought theWilshire apartment , where she was living now , right after Sid 's death . Why ? It was on Canavan 's checklist , one of the things he 'd ask her about . She said , " What 's the point ? " Meaning the map and the pictures . " I saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had introduced himself and handed Robin his business card that said Joseph Canavan Associates , Insurance Investigations . She had looked at it and said , " Are you a Joe or a Joseph ? " He told her either , but usually Joe . She said , " Well , come in and sit down , Joe , anywhere you like , " picking up on his name in a way that sounded natural and gave him a glimpse of her personality . She looked at his business card again and said , " You 're not with the insurance company , like the ones before . " He told her they called him in when they red-flagged a claim , had questions about it . All it meant , certain conditions existed the company felt should be investigated . Canavan said they wanted to know in their hearts the fire was either accidental or providential before paying the claim . Robin said , " Well , I can tell you the same thing I told the fire department , sheriff 's deputies , the state fire marshal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms . The fire marshal 's guy brought a dog that sniffed around . He said when the dog was working it ate seventy Kibbles a day . What would you like to know ? " This was when Canavan first arrived . Now he turned from the map to look at Robin sitting back in the sofa . She resembled a girl in the movies he liked a lot , Linda ... very sexy , had an Italian name . He said , " I wanted to show you the path of the main fire , where it came down west of your place , on the other side of the ridge . " " So how did my house catch fire , " Robin said . " Is that the question ? How about sparks , Joe ? The wind blows sparks over the ridge from the brush fires in Boca Chica and they land by my house . You buy that ? Or a rabbit or a coyote caught fire and ran like hell right through my yard . They said on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread it around . Otherwise , I have no idea . Joe , I watched my house go up in flames . I might 've stayed till it burned down , I do n't know , maybe not . A deputy came up the road and made me leave . " Linda Fiorentino . That was who Robin looked like , in that movie  --  he could n't remember the name of it  --  where she goes in a bar called Ray 's , remembering that because of the sign , the Y in ray 's shaped like a martini glass . Linda goes in and asks for a Manhattan . The bartender ignores her and she asks him who you have to blow to get a drink around here . Those were n't the exact words , but that was the idea . Robin had that same effortless way about her , confident , with the New York sound like Linda 's , a cool chick , tough . Watch your step with her . " So you were n't living in the house at the time . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV  --  fire trucks , people loading their cars , coming out of the house with their insurance policies , running around looking for pets . One guy had all their good china in a basket and was lowering it into the swimming pool . I thought , I better get up there , quick . " " Load your car , " Canavan said , " with anything of value , uh ? But I understand the house was already on fire . I think that 's in the statement you made . " " By the time I got there , yeah . " Linda waved her hand in the air . " The back of the house , by a brush thicket . Sid was supposed to have it cut back , but never got around to it . The sky by that time was thick with smoke . " " See , what the company wonders about , why your house was the only one on Arroyo that caught fire . " " I guess ' cause there are n't any close by . I 'm at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up there ?
