With 30 years experience at Exxon and nine more at Citibank , Yashiro has never been a member of Japan 's insular financial community . " I do n't follow the Japanese way of doing things , " he says . Yashiro talks about competition , profitability and performance  --  words rarely heard until recently among Japanese bankers .
