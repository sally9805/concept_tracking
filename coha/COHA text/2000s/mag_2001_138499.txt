TUESDAY , JAN. 16 , was a quiet day in Camden , N.J. , a neglected city of 80,000 souls immediately over the Benjamin Franklin Bridge from Philadelphia . On that day Camden police recorded only two domestic disputes , two auto thefts , one aggravated assault with a bottle , another with a shotgun and one drug arrest for possession with intent to distribute within 1,000 feet of a school . The day 's only real news came out of the creaking gym at Camden High : Dajuan Wagner , a senior guard considered by many to be the best schoolboy basketball player in the country , scored 100 points in a game . He could have scored more , but he spent the final four minutes standing beside the team 's scrubs and student fans , kids who might never leave Camden . // " A hundred is a magic number , " says the 6 ' 3 " man-child , who will turn 18 on Feb. 4 . " But scoring 100 was never a goal . " // In the days after Wagner 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conference opponent , Gloucester Township Tech  --  sportswriters and radio babblers , locally and nationally , sermonized about the death of sportsmanship . ( That same Tuesday night Cedric Hensley , a 6 ' 4 " junior swingman from the Heritage Christian Academy in Cleveland , Texas , scored 101 points in a 178-28 win over The Banff School , whose squad included 10 freshmen , none taller than 6 feet . ) Some commentators flayed the Camden coach , Glen Jackson , for having his team , ranked third in the country by USA Today , press all 32 minutes of the game . Psychologists were trotted out to pontificate about the damage done to the kids on the losing side . There was only one problem . The losers from Gloucester , they were just fine . // " We were all laughing about it , except Coach , " says Brandon Sunkett , a Gloucester Tech starter . " You know Dajuan 's gon na score ; what you do n't know is how . So you might as well enjoy watching it . " // In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain playgrounds  --  9th and Ferry , Whitman Park , 8th and Central-Wagner has been a legend since grade school . He is an offensive machine , able to score off the dribble or from NBA three-point range . He 's bigger than the rappers , bigger than the dealers , bigger than the preachers . He 's Juanny , and all through Camden his exploits are known . " This is a city where people are trying to survive , " says Ray Massi , a Camden police captain . " Somebody like Dajuan comes along , you 've got to celebrate him . We know the kids who get in trouble in this city . He 's not one of them . " // Except on one occasion . On Dec. 8 Wagner and two other Camden High students allegedly beat up a fourth student in a school hallway . All three boys were charged with juvenile delinquency and suspended for five days . The victim required four stitches over his eye , but no weapons were involved . A pretrial conference is scheduled for next week to determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even arrived at the police station that day , a small cadre of lawyers had gathered there on his behalf . That 's what happens when you 're the best high school basketball player in the country . The night of his 100-point game , a family friend arranged for Wagner to have dinner with two Super Bowl participants , Ray Lewis of the Baltimore Ravens and Jessie Armstead of the New York Giants . Wagner has often hung with Allen Iverson of the Philadelphia 76ers. // The kid is connected . His father , Milt ( Ice ) Wagner , was a celebrated guard at Camden High 20 years ago , famous for prodigious scoring without breaking a sweat . In 1986 he won an NCAA title with Louisville , and in 1988 he won an NBA championship with the Los Angeles Lakers . The old man  --  he 's 37 now  --  played two years in the NBA , nine overseas and three more in various U.S. pro leagues before retiring last year . // Milt never married Dajuan 's mother , Lisa Paulk , but he was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquaintance of Milt 's , John Calipari , was working as an assistant coach for the Sixers , and the Wagners , father and son , frequently attended practices . " I 'd watch , " says Dajuan . " That 's how you learn . " // Calipari attended many Camden High home games , mesmerized by Wagner but also intrigued by a Panthers forward , 6 ' 8 " Arthur Barclay , who grew up in the same house as Dajuan . Arthur and Dajuan think of themselves as brothers , although they are not blood relatives , and Wagner has been saying for years that he would play his college ball wherever his brother went . Calipari , who became tight with the family , took Dajuan at his word . // In December 1999 Calipari began talks with Memphis about coaching there . In mid-March of last year , he took the job . About a month later he offered Milt , who was looking to get into coaching , a job as an administrative assistant with the team . At nearly the same time , Barclay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the end of his junior year , Dajuan ended all recruiting suspense before it really began , announcing that he would be heading to Memphis , too . It was all very cozy . // Legal , too : When Calipari was with the Sixers , NCAA recruiting rules did not apply to him . " The more gracious coaches are saying , ' You got a good one , ' " Calipari says . " The others say , ' You hired the father to get the kid . ' Truth is , Milt could get a job anywhere , Arthur was underrecruited and Dajuan might be in the NBA in a year . But I 'm gon na teach him how to play defense first . " // It 's unlikely that Milt truly could get work anywhere , because most schools require a coach to have a bachelor 's degree , and Milt does n't have one . However , he 's working for Calipari and taking classes toward his degree . Barclay might have been under-recruited because he did n't qualify academically , but he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his first year . As for Dajuan , his legend grows with every game . // Two nights after the 100-point game , the Panthers were home again . Four minutes into the game  --  after Wagner had scored on a driving layup , a three-pointer and a dunk-the fans were on their feet , including Dajuan 's mother . As a junior at Camden High she ran track , but by her senior year , 1982-83 , she was pregnant with Dajuan and her running days were over . Last Thursday she was back in her old gym , keeping her son 's stats on pink paper and keeping him honest , too . At one point she yelled , " That was your turnover , Juanny ! " In a quiet moment , though , she said to another spectator , " I got a job , I got a house , I 'm not going to send him to the NBA so he can support me . What I need him to get is an education . " // Wagner scored 54 points . The Panthers , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 84-73 . Afterward a local columnist , who had questioned the sporting value of Wagner 's 100-point game , found himself surrounded by Paulk and a half-dozen fuming fans , all fussing at him for his criticism . // Dajuan was away from the fray , in a hallway , surrounded by ogling kids . " My father taught me to respect the game , " he was saying softly . He 's going places , and everybody knows it . " If you respect the game , " Dajuan continued , " everything else will be all right . "
