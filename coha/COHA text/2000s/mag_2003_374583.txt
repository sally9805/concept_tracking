In a sideline to making movies , Michael Caine is a prominent restaurateur . But he might have been an expert vintner  --  for he knows how to wait for good things to ripen . His career , for instance . For nine years he played in British rep theater before getting a meaty film role , in Zulu , at 30 ; the credit read , " Introducing Michael Caine . " He starred in 80 or so movies , good , bad and awful , then in his late 60s hit a gold streak of mature roles and quality films . One of these , The Quiet American , contains his boldest , subtlest work ; but the events of Sept. 11 delayed the film 's release for a year . Again , Caine waited and was rewarded . Last week he was nominated for a Best Actor Academy Award . On March 23 , nine days after his 70th birthday , he 'll have an aisle seat at the Oscars . <P> The honor is nothing new for a craftsman who , in 40 busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Caine has been nominated three times before as Best Actor ( for Alfie , Sleuth and Educating Rita ) , without a victory , and won twice as Sup-porting Actor ( Hannah and Her Sisters , The Cider House Rules ) . But the Quiet American citation is richly earned . Even Caine might think he deserves , if not an Oscar , a medal of honor for doing justice to Graham Greene 's 1955 novel and tunneling into the murky life of its protagonist , the Englishman Thomas Fowler . " The role had an extreme degree of difficulty , " he says , " like in the Olympics . It was putting across all sides of a character without going outside to hit on it , just with looks and pauses . " He speaks of the part with a drama student 's zeal : " It 's every actor 's dream to get something like this . " Another role worth waiting for . <P> Sir Maurice Micklewhite  --  Caine never bothered legally changing his name , so he was knighted in 2000 with the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a season for every purpose , and vice versa . Growing up Cockney , in the Rotherhithe section of London , taught him to observe life in the raw : to retain those images and that accent , which , along with the spectacles , became his trademark . Doing rep gave him lessons in the star 's gift of getting noticed , and the actor 's craft of hiding in plain sight . " In rep it 's a different play each week , " he says . " You 'd be the butler one week , the lord the next , the Cockney handyman the week after . And in some of the companies , the mistress of the house ! " <P> When The Ipcress File and Alfie made Caine a star in the mid- ' 60s , he could have coasted in one film genre , one consistent , marketable personality . Instead , he says , " I treated movies as a kind of repertory . I try to do a different part every time . I 've done heroes , reprobates , gangsters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , opium addicts , I 've played them all . ' Cause the way I see it , I am not a movie star per se . I 'm a movie actor . And the difference between the two is , when a movie star gets a script he says , ' How can I change this script to suit me ?
