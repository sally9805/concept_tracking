Nearly two hundred years ago , one bright and cool October day , a gaily dressed company of horsemen was ferried across the Connecticut River at Wethersfield . On the far shore , a troop of horses greeted them and offered their escort to Hartford , the capital . Condescendingly , Sir Edmund Andros , the new governor of all New England , accepted , and many of his courtiers smiled at the homespun garments these men of the backwoods wore . Little did they dream that these men and their representatives in the Assembly were about to prove more than a match in wits for them and their leader . Soon the roughness of the road made them forget everything but the journey . Slowly it dragged its forty-mile length to a close . The early autumn twilight closed about them , and in the gathering darkness , they filed into the candle-lit Assembly Room . There the Assemblymen awaited them . Sir Edmund Andros curtly commanded the clerk to read aloud the royal commission appointing him governor of Connecticut . The reading finished , he rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now Connecticut loved its charter . King Charles II had given it to the state through its representative , John Winthrop , Jr . It happened that he had a ring given to his father by the King 's father . And the King , cherishing the memory of his father-who had been beheaded-was greatly moved by the sight of this ring . So moved , that he gave Connecticut a charter , which allowed the colony much more liberty than any other colony had . So the story goes . // It was this charter which Sir Edmund Andros was asking Connecticut to give up . What could Connecticut do but obey , for the demand was made by the representatives of the new King James II ! So the charter was brought forward and laid on the table . But before Andros could take it , Robert Treat sprang to his feet and began telling the new governor all that the charter meant to the people . He was pleading that it be left in the custody of the state , when in an instant , all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and relit the candles , the charter was gone ! And as long as Andros was governor , it was never found . Not until Queen Mary came to the throne and decided that again each New England state could have a separate government did the charter appear . Where had it been ? Not for many years did the people know . The truth was that when the signal was given , all the candles had been blown out and two of the Assemblymen , Talcott and Stanley , had seized the charter and handed it out an open window to Talcott 's son-in-law , Joseph Wadsworth . He had thrust it under his arm , his long cloak hiding it , and had made his way swiftly up the Wyllys hill . In front of the house , stood a great white oak with a hollow in its trunk about two feet above the ground . Into this hollow , Wadsworth thrust the charter thinking , Never will Andros think of looking here ! Still Connecticut lives under that charter , for after the Revolution , it was adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to the Historical Society in Hartford , you could see the queer old leather case in which the precious parchment was kept . There , too , you could read the original charter itself . Framed in wood from the Charter Oak , it hangs in a fireproof section of Memorial Hall . Part of the trunk of the oak is there , too , and nearby in the State House , the Speaker 's Chair is made from the wood of this famous old tree . For on August 21 , 1856 , a terrific gale felled this old oak , loved by generation after generation . The next evening all the church bells tolled , while the people gathered about the splintered fragments of the tree which had been the guardian of their liberty ! <p>
