<p> Compelling business books of 2005 proved business is about much more than just the bottom line . <p> The books I listed among my favorites for the year included a look at stock investing as a means of dealing with divorce , war in the Magic Kingdom and using your inner child to get your way . <p> Some of the engrossing business reads also dealt with practical concerns , from dealing with bosses from hell to successful networking . <p> These 10 are a mix designed to represent books that tell business stories , offer personal advice or cover management and marketing issues . <p> The books are not ranked in order from one to 10 because , for instance , the book that answers the most compelling questions of one reader may seem like old news to another . <p> But there is a definite effort here to put some of my favorite reads first . <p> The common thread is they all made a lasting impression long after I read the last page . <p> Without further ado , here 's the list . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Schuster , <p> $29.95 <p> This is one of those books that will cause you to exclaim " wow ! " when you 're finished . At least it did me . Perhaps " Disney War " was especially compelling for a baby boomer like me , who grew up on movies , books and TV shows from the Disney monolith . <p> It presents a picture that 's a sharp contrast to the gentle years of Walt Disney 's sweet , homogenized world , of Mickey and Bambi and Dumbo . Beneath the placid , happy surface of the land of Mickey Mouse and his pals are turmoil , discontent , deceit and outright war . Stewart 's exhaustive research peels back the seemingly bland Disney facade to reveal the disturbingly dark side of Disneyland . <p> Never Eat Alone <p> By Keith Ferrazzi with Tahi Raz <p> Currency Doubleday , $24.95 <p> Networking books are all over the place , but Keith Ferrazzi 's effort stands head and shoulders above the crowd . I 've read many networking books , and this one is the best . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is the book I would pick ( ignoring the fact that I would n't have anyone to network with on a desert island ) . <p> Networking is an all-important concept in business . Many hand out business cards like candy at Christmas , thinking this will do it . Keith Ferrazzi begs to differ . <p> His book argues that a successful networker is one who is willing to help others without strings attached , and conversely , is able to accept what others can do for him . <p> American Sucker <p> By David Denby <p> Back Bay Books , $14.95 <p> What 's a New York film critic doing writing a book about finances ? It is an unlikely juxtaposition at first , but as the narrative progresses , the reader will understand David Denby 's motivation . <p> This one truly touched my heart in a way few other books did this year . <p> Denby is launched on his odyssey in the world of stock trading when his wife of 18 years announces her intention to divorce him . If you 're looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book for you , although it does point up some good principles for novice investors . <p> If , however , you like books that illustrate a business lesson from an intensely personal standpoint , you 'll not only like this book , you 'll find yourself moved by it . <p> Denby reveals how the process of learning to invest in the stock market also helps him deal with his personal crisis . <p> How to Negotiate Like a Child <p> By Bill Adler Jr . <p> Amacom , $17.95 <p> The cover , with a picture of a petulant-looking child , captured my attention and made me laugh . The cover 's promise of a good read did not disappoint . <p> Bill Adler 's book of tactics on negotiating like a child was a heckuva fun read that mixed in with some serious business advice . <p> Ever have days when you wish you could act like a little kid ? Times when you 'd like to throw yourself on the floor and pitch a fit to get your way ? <p> You still can . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has written a book that 's more practical and useful than you might think . He describes tactics that go well beyond histrionics in a charming book that nicely packages its advice in clever language . <p> All Marketers Are Liars <p> By Seth Godin <p> Portfolio , $23.95 <p> Whenever I receive a Seth Godin book , I feel a tingle of anticipation . He 's always original , and he delights in writing business books that are far off the beaten trail . <p> This one makes the list for its inventive treatment of how people sell by asking : Are marketers born liars or just great storytellers ? We all lie or tell stories at some level . We tell stories about all kinds of things : our friends , products , the Houston Astros and even our pets . <p> Godin explores this very human tendency , but the book is not about deceiving people . Rather , it 's about telling and living the truth . But as sellers know , those who can tell a captivating story to buyers are a lot more likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By Brook Larmer <p> Gotham Books , $26 <p> Brook Larmer 's book wormed its way onto my sights as one of the best of the year with its unusual blend of investigative reporting , sports bio and business book . That 's not an easy feat to pull off , but Larmer succeeds admirably . <p> The former Newsweek bureau chief in Shanghai examines the remarkable phenomenon that is Yao Ming from all angles . However , this book is not just a sports bio . It takes on a decidedly business slant as Larmer closely examines the politics of the Chinese sports empire , American big business and the mass marketing of an NBA celebrity . <p> The narrative is an absorbing one , as Larmer digs deep to uncover many facts and anecdotes that make readers feel like they were there to see the Houston Rockets star at key moments in his life . <p> A Survival Guide for Working With Bad Bosses : Dealing With Bullies , Idiots , Back-Stabbers and Other Managers from Hell <p> By Gini Graham Scott , Ph.D <p> Amacom Books , $15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world of work . Ask any group of employees about supervisors from the past and the subject of bad bosses is sure to come up . <p> It 's a common experience , but Gini Graham Scott does far more than just retell horror stories . In these short chapters she lists practical tactics for trying to deal with unpleasant bosses who make it hard to come to work each day . But not all the antagonists are ogres . Some are pleasant enough but will still drive you crazy with their disorganization or procrastination . Her relaxed , common-sense style won me over and convinced me her book was the guide of all guides to dealing , as best you can , with supervisors who make your life hell . <p> What Goes Up : The Uncensored History of Modern Wall Street <p> By Eric J. Weiner <p> Little , Brown &; Co. , $27.95 <p> Many histories of Wall Street have been written , but what makes this one different was that the narrative came straight from the mouth of many of the major players in that story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Eric Weiner digs deep to peel back the complex layers comprising modern Wall Street , letting the key figures speak for themselves . He weaves their takes into a fascinating narrative of frank , no-holds , barred discussion of Wall Street . The principals in the book seem to be rather free in their recollections of their own personal piece of Wall Street history , making for a delightful change from the usual business histories . <p> The Great American Job Scam <p> By Greg LeRoy <p> Berrett-Koehler Publications , $24.95 <p> In the field of investigative business reporting , few writers are on a par with Greg LeRoy . LeRoy 's investigative style busts chops and sizzles up his narrative , especially the way he describes the trap that so many towns fall for . <p> Company A promises to move in or expand operations in a certain place and create new paying jobs . In return , the company demands huge tax breaks and other subsidies from state and local governments . The town does n't want to lose this employer , so it caves in to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company rewards the town by failing to keep its promises as advertised . LeRoy 's righteous-anger style of writing caught my attention and lifted this book above others of its ilk . <p> The Likeability Factor <p> By Tim Sanders <p> Crown Business , $23 <p> Like Seth Godin , Tim Sanders is known for writing unconventional business books , but Sanders homes in on emotions ( he previously wrote " Love Is the Killer App " ) . He gets points from me for acknowledging that business is not just about cold hard facts . Sanders once again zeroes in on an area of his strength . For me , this propelled Sanders ' book out of the mire of predictable business books to one that deserved to be in the 10 best . <p> Do you know what your L-factor is ? Do you even know what the term means ? If not , perhaps it 's time to dive into Sanders ' book . <p> Quite simply , the L-factor stands for how easy it is for people to like you ; and according to Sanders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success in life and business .
