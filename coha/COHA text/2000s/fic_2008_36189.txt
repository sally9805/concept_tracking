SIX WEEKS LATER <p> Nightmares of death by black water ticked off the hours of the deepest sleep Shauna McAllister had ever experienced . In an eternal loop , she choked and drowned and was somehow resuscitated , only to choke and drown again , and again , in an endless terror . Always the same fight , the same thrashing for air . Always the same intense agony for the same amount of time before the screen of her mind dimmed . <p> Then it would flicker back to life . <p> Merciless , exhausting . <p> Her stomach hurt with the penetration of a hundred slicing knives , cutting her enough to scrape and bleed and sting . The cold water was not a strong enough anesthetic . <p> She could not remember where she was or how she had come to be here . <p> Why was n't her father with her ? And where had Rudy gone ? <p> The water closed over her head again . She considered welcoming death and letting her fatigue have its way . She was so tired . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and helpful , grabbed her wrist . In that Herculean grip was all the strength she could not muster . And so it was that at the very moment she resigned herself to drowning , she sensed as she rose through the black waters that maybe she would not die today . <p> Shauna broke the surface , gasping and flopping like a snagged fish tossed onto the deck of a- <p> No , she was on a bed , some narrow thing that rattled when she moved . Her hands hit metal rails and she grabbed hold to avoid sliding back underwater , though some sixth sense told her there was no water . She started coughing and could not stop , as if the oxygen in this place would kill her just as quickly as liquid . <p> How did she get here ? <p> Someone shoved a pillow under her shoulders . Someone was speaking . Several people were speaking at once , animated and urgent . <p> She opened her eyes and took her first full lungful of air . <p> A middle-aged woman in nurse 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gap-toothed mouth slack . She hit an intercom button in the panel over the bed , punching it so hard the plastic speaker rattled . <p> Shauna was half-aware of people spilling into the room . <p> " Dr. Siders , " the woman said into the wall . She put a hand over her heart as if to prevent its escape . " We need you here now . She 's awake ! " <p> * * * <p> Still disoriented , Shauna lay at the center of the small gathering in the room . Through her mental haze , she locked onto a tall doctor in a white lab coat as he moved to the head of her bed . The man was 80 percent limbs and 20 percent torso , long and wiry and strung taut . <p> " Hello , Shauna . You can hear me ? " <p> She felt her chin dip a fraction of an inch . <p> He put his hand on her arm . " I 'm Dr. Gary Siders . And you-well let 's just say you 're one very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case I 've had in here for a while . " <p> Where was here ? Where was Rudy ? <p> She tried to remember . Random images collided in her mind in a wreck that could not be construed as an explanation : shopping at an open-air market in Guatemala , congratulating a colleague at the CPA firm where she worked , stir-frying veggies in a wok at her downtown loft . <p> These stray events seemed disconnected from this white bed , this white room , these people dressed in white . She could n't remember , and the void was the most disconcerting piece of this white puzzle . <p> She saw a flash of color . Blue . A blue class ring on a long , angular hand that was supporting a man 's chin . A handsome man . He stood under the TV , arms crossed , and his worry-lined forehead tripped some wire in Shauna 's brain that said friendly . His brown eyes held hers and he smiled almost imperceptibly , hopefully . <p> Her mind held no recognition . But he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object in an unfamiliar , cold room . She smiled back . <p> On the other side of the bed , her eyes landed on Patrice McAllister . <p> Shauna shivered involuntarily . How was it possible , after all these years , that the woman could make her feel afraid ? Patrice wore her trademark navy blue pantsuit and deadpan expression . She had all of Diane Keaton 's good looks , but her heart was a stone . <p> The scar tissue under Shauna 's arm seemed to burn , as always when Patrice stared at her . Shauna looked for her father . No sign of him . No surprise there . <p> Instead , she saw Uncle Trent standing behind Patrice . A close-cropped layer of white hair covered his sun-spotted head . Trent rested his hand on Patrice 's shoulder as if forcing her to stay put . The laugh lines around his eyes eased Shauna 's fear . <p> In these beats of recognition , Shauna felt her body with new awareness , as if her senses had been on vacation and just returned : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomach , the hardness of her mattress , the discomfort of her itchy sheets . She wanted to get out of bed . Her muscles would not respond . <p> " Let 's sit you up . " The doctor reached the controls for the hospital bed , and she rose with a whir . " Better ? " <p> " Where is this ? " her vocal cords rasped . <p> " Hill Country Medical Center . " <p> She 'd been in this hospital many times , but never as a patient . Behind him on a counter , old flowers wilted in dirty water . Other empty vases lined up behind these . <p> " How long ? " <p> " This should only take about five minutes . We 'll schedule a complete neuropsychological evaluation when we know you 're up for it . That will take a day or two . " <p> " I mean , how long have I been here ? " <p> He hesitated . " Six weeks . " <p> Six weeks ? <p> " You 've drifted in and out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't remember any of that . " <p> " Not unusual . " <p> " What day is it ? " <p> He checked his wristwatch . " October 14 . Sunday . You came in September 1 . " <p> September . <p> She tried to remember August . <p> Nothing . July . <p> Nothing . Farther . <p> Nothing . <p> She 'd been here six weeks ? Her mind did n't want to connect with the idea of it , much less any specific memory . <p> He flashed a blinding light across her eyes and she winced . The stranger under the TV stepped to the bed and placed a warm hand on her blanketed foot . The gesture gave her courage . Who was this man ? Someone she trusted , apparently . <p> " Follow my fingers , " Dr. Siders said . She focused on his sinewy hand , contemplating how so much time could have slipped by without her knowing it . Six weeks from- <p> From what ? <p> She 'd taken her trip to Guatemala . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ran a fingernail along the sole of her other foot . Her reflexes snatched it out of his reach . " You have no respect for the Rancho Levels-if you move through those any faster , I 'll have to discharge you this afternoon . The GCS score is useless . Apparently all you 're guilty of is a concussion . No TBI . The MRIs and CATs are clear , though they 're not the most reliable , considering you 're in a drug trial . " <p> She had no idea what he was talking about . <p> " Can you tell me who 's here in the room with us ? " he asked her . <p> Shauna kept her eyes on the doctor . " My father 's wife , Patrice McAllister . And Uncle Trent-Trent Wilde , a family friend . He 's not actually my uncle . " <p> " And what does Mr. Wilde do ? " <p> The answer came to her without her needing to search for it . This surprised her . " He 's the CEO of my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that company located ? " <p> " Houston . " <p> " Do you know who he is ? " Dr. Siders gestured toward the man whose warm hand still rested on her foot . <p> She studied him again . High hairline . Color-coordinated waves and eyes . Dark brown sugar . Older than she was , maybe midthirties . Professional . He might be an athlete-a distance runner or a cyclist . As for who he was , she came up empty . <p> She shook her head . Patrice sighed and tapped her fingers on her crossed arms . <p> " You have no recollection of Wayne Spade ? " the doctor asked . " I understand you two are well acquainted . " <p> " How well ? " <p> Uncle Trent exchanged a glance with Wayne , who averted his eyes and shoved his hands into his pockets . <p> " Honey , " Trent said , " you and Wayne have been close for several months . " <p> Embarrassment settled over Shauna . " You do n't mean- " <p> " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his smile covered up what Shauna sensed was disappointment . She heard what he did n't say : they had been more , and he did n't want the truth of it to hurt either one of them . " Take your time . " <p> How could she have forgotten someone so close to her ? Distress filled her stomach . <p> " I 'm sorry , " she whispered . <p> Dr. Siders turned back to her . " Wayne saved your life , my dear . He pulled you out of the water and performed CPR until the paramedics arrived . " <p> This man ? He saved her life ? What water ? <p> The doctor went on . " Where do you live , Shauna ? " <p> " Wha- ? Um , Austin . " <p> " What is your father 's name ? " <p> " Landon . McAllister . " <p> " And he is presently campaigning for the office of ? " <p> " President , " she said . " Where is he ? " <p> " California , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contacting him about your status . Can you tell me the outcome of the primary elections in February ? " <p> He won , of course , or else he would n't still be campaigning . She had a few questions of her own , but the conversation was moving too quickly for her to articulate the bottom line . Why could she remember her father but not-what was his name ? Wayne ? Why could she remember last year but not this summer ? She stood unbalanced at the edge of a yawning gap filled with nothing but anxiety . <p> " Can we move it along please ? " Patrice asked . <p> Dr. Siders checked his notes . " Do you remember the accident ? " <p> Wayne seemed to recover from the blow of Shauna 's forgetfulness . Touching her ankles , he said , " Is now the best time to bring all this up ? " <p> " The-I was in an accident ? " <p> " Oh , for crying out loud , " Patrice murmured . <p> Wayne frowned at her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at her stepmother , but she caught Uncle Trent 's eyes . He shook his head at Shauna . Let it go . <p> " Yes , " the doctor said to Shauna . " Do you remember it ? " <p> Shauna looked at Wayne . " You were there ? How did you ... ? " <p> " He was following you home from my house , " Uncle Trent said . <p> " I do n't understand , " Shauna said . <p> " Dr. Siders , " Wayne said , " she 's so tired . " <p> " She 's been sleeping six weeks , " Patrice said , standing . " She can stay awake a few more minutes . " <p> " Patrice , " Trent said . <p> " No , " she snapped . " Enough of this melodrama . We deserve to know what she knows . " <p> " I do n't understand . " Shauna gripped the bedsheets in a double fist . " What happened ? " <p> " You tell us , Shauna . I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulling a stunt " - Patrice leaned over the bed- " if I find out you 're making a mockery of Rudy and your father with this act ... " She frowned and fumbled for words . <p> Nothing but Patrice 's own twisted view of the world could make sense of such accusations . Shauna 's temples throbbed . She looked at Uncle Trent , begging him without words to sort this out for her . <p> He pulled Patrice away from the bed . " Rudy was with you , honey . You were driving when your car collided with a truck and went off a bridge . " <p> Shauna managed a shallow breath but she could n't exhale . " Is he okay ? " <p> Wayne 's eyes shifted . Dr. Siders appeared as baffled as Shauna felt . Trent looked at Patrice but offered no answer . <p> " Is Rudy okay ? " <p> Patrice glared at Shauna . " You do n't deserve an answer to that . You will tell us exactly what happened . Where you got the drugs . Why you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would go to such lengths . You 're a beast . You have nearly ruined your father . It 's a wonder he has managed to go on . " <p> Rudy was hurt . Fear injected adrenaline into Shauna 's heart . <p> Drugs ? <p> " Where is he ? " she demanded . <p> " California , " Trent said . <p> " I mean Rudy ! " She threw back the covers . <p> Patrice stepped back into Trent . Dr. Siders snapped out of his gawking . He dropped his charts onto the counter behind him , then leaned across the bed to catch Shauna 's arm . " I want you out of here , all of you ! We spoke about this . " <p> She slapped Dr. Siders 's hands away . " Tell me where Rudy is . " <p> Wayne 's face lit up with worry , and he reached for Shauna as she dropped her legs over the edge of the bed . A rolling table stood between them , and he bumped into it . <p> Her bare feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atrophied legs , which resented her demands as much as everyone else in the room apparently did . The blood in her body raced to her feet to be of help , emptying her head . Patrice stood back and watched Shauna fall . She went down before anyone else could catch her , clipping her jaw on the table and clamping down on her tongue . She tasted blood and heard her skull smack the vinyl flooring , then she slipped back into the black waters . <p> Chapter Two Wayne held Shauna 's elbow and helped her down the white hallway . She insisted on walking this time , desperate to get out of the wheelchair , and determined to get out of this hospital as quickly as possible . It was already Wednesday . <p> After a day of fluctuating consciousness followed by two full days of being scanned , tested , poked , quizzed , and studied , she had many more questions than the first time she awoke . <p> But no more answers . They were all refusing to speak to her about Rudy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe how much progress you 've made already , " Wayne said as her energy flagged . She paused for a break and leaned against the wall . " You 're amazing . " <p> She searched his eyes . " Please , Wayne . Tell me . " <p> " Tell you what ? " <p> " What no one else will . About Rudy . " <p> " We 've been over this . " His tone reflected sadness rather than impatience . " Shauna , they 've told me as much as they 've told you . How bad can it be if they 've sent him home ? " <p> " This is ridiculous ! Why all the secrecy ? " <p> " He 's home . And he 's got the best care your father 's money can buy . " <p> " So for all we know they 've sent him home to die ? " <p> Wayne chuckled . " Wow . You really do go to the worst-case scenario , do n't you ? " <p> " Do n't laugh at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and stayed by her side . " I only meant that your father would n't be on the road if that was the case . " <p> " It 's maddening ! " <p> " I 'm sure it 's for your best . Trent has everything taken care- " <p> " My father should be the one in that role . But then he never was where he needed to be , was he ? " <p> " He 's on his way back . " <p> " So I hear . " <p> Wayne did n't say anything to that . Really , what could he say ? Shauna did n't wish her family 's dysfunctional dynamics on anyone . <p> " Thank you for all you 've done these last few days . " <p> " You 're welcome . " <p> " I feel really bad about ... about not ... " <p> Wayne placed a finger on her lips , giving her a light static shock . She flinched . He looked surprised , then grinned . <p> " Do n't worry about any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out as we go . Right now , you have bigger things to worry about . " <p> He placed his free hand between her shoulder blades and guided her into the office , rubbing her back gently . <p> Dr. Siders was already there , his gangly body folded into a chair too small for him . The office had been painted uninspiring shades of mauve and green that failed to calm her . The colors clashed with the hyper arrangement of chairs and a chaos of paperwork on every flat surface . <p> " I 'll wait outside , " Wayne said . <p> " You can stay . " <p> " This is your private business , " Wayne said . " Tell me as much or as little as you want later . I 'll be here for you . " <p> His sensitivity took the edge off her nerves . She would press for information about Rudy until they told her what she wanted to hear or discharged her . <p> Dr. Millie Harding , a devil-may-care psychiatrist with frizzy red hair and glowing lipstick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeted Shauna with a kind touch on the shoulder . <p> Shauna hardly noticed it . <p> " You promised to tell me about Rudy , " she said to Dr. Siders . <p> " Absolutely , Shauna . But you 're our main concern right now . Let us bring you up to speed on our evaluations , and then- " <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
