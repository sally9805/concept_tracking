This emergency situation often occurs when the driver least expects it . Will you know what to do if it happens to you ? . ? IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL SPRING EVENING . I was at the helm of an excursion vessel in New York Harbor . We were stopped off the Statue of Liberty so passengers could enjoy the view . Then a drunk decided he needed to get closer . No one on the crew saw him fall . A few passengers did but they quickly lost sight of him . Within seconds he had disappeared . I immediately issued a Mayday and reported our position . The crew lined passengers along the railings and instructed them to keep the victim in sight , while they tossed a number of PFDs overboard along with a life ring and water-activated light . In the long run , that light saved the man 's life , although he never saw it . The ebb was at its height  --  in New York Harbor it runs strong and swift  --  and I knew that the swimmer would be swept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kicked the boat around and placed it downstream of the victim , at a point he could n't have reached yet . Within seconds he was spotted . Then we had to get him back aboard the high-sided ship . The victim was comatose and half-drowned ; we were without a waterline entry port . Two crewmen were lowered into the water . We were preparing to haul him up when the New York Police Department arrived in a RIB . That guy survived , although barely . A situation like this one emphasizes the importance of the old axiom " going overboard is not an option . " Essentially , a person 's odds of survival begin diving immediately after he hits the water . But situations like this one do arise , and if it happens when you 're on watch , you should know what to do . The following steps need to be taken immediately . I 've ordered the steps according to the recommendations of " Chapman Piloting , " but the sequence could change depending on the situation . 1 The person who first becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other passengers by shouting " man overboard . " The driver at the helm should immediately punch the MOB button on the GPS. 2 The person who has the victim in view must not take his eyes off of him , even if that person has other responsibilities . The person assigned to keep an eye on the victim does that and nothing else until the recovery effort begins . 3 Get available life preservers and/or buoyant gear overboard , even if it appears that the victim ca n't immediately reach the objects . If possible , place the flotation devices upwind/current of the person so that they will drift down toward him . 4 Return to the victim ; turn the boat in his direction . 5 Inform others of the situation and your location via VHF radio . If you have any doubt that an immediate recovery is possible ( if the victim is not wearing a life preserver , for instance ) then issue a Mayday , particularly if you 're offshore or in any kind of weather . You should send the Pan-Pan urgency signal in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must plan for the worst  --  the person is unconscious or otherwise unable to assist . In drills I 've performed , I 've had more success approaching a victim from leeward  --  into the wind  --  and allowing him to drift toward the boat . I have more control than I do approaching from windward , when it seems more likely I 'll miscalculate the drift of the victim or boat . I 've lost time maneuvering to reposition the boat . However , the choice to approach from upwind or downwind often depends on the boat and the sea conditions . 7 The hardest part will always be getting the person back aboard . In boats with high freeboard , a mechanical advantage ( a block and tackle ) is almost always necessary . A line should be securely placed around the person 's chest and under the armpits and bent to hauling gear . Obviously , this procedure needs the proper gear and practice on the part of the crew . It often necessitates crew entering the water to assist . In any kind of sea , recovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the risk of serious injury . I 've had luck getting people into a dinghy or life raft , so do n't hesitate to launch one , especially a model with a ramp-style boarding arrangement . Devices like the Lifesling , a version of which includes a hoisting apparatus , can be invaluable . There is no surefire way to retrieve a man overboard , but a boat that 's properly equipped and manned by a crew trained in recovery techniques will have a better chance of bringing that person back on board safely . BOX EASY DROP-OFF What do you do when you need to come alongside a dock for just a few moments to pick up a passenger and there is n't enough room for your boat ? Well , maybe there is . In New York Harbor , where berthing space is hard to come by , water-taxi operators and tug jockeys have worked out a few neat techniques . If there 's enough dock space to go bow in , for instance , you can come in dead slow at a right angle to the dock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stop a foot or so off , then send crew to the bow with lines from both your midships cleats . The crewman can ask for help securing the lines to bollards or cleats on the dock , on either side of the boat ( they do n't have to be equidistant ) . Once the lines are set , come gently astern . With the boat working against those lines it will stay in place ; you 'll be able to compensate for wind and current by adjusting the rudder or outdrive . This procedure is even easier with twins . You 'll compensate for drift by adjusting engine rpm . If you would rather back in , it works the same way ; just run those midships lines aft and come ahead . BOX NIGHT MOVES One of the first things you should do in a man overboard situation is get the boat headed back to the point where the person fell . That 's easier to do by day , but more challenging at night . Unless the victim is in clear view of somebody aboard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions should be to mark down the compass heading of the course you were on when the passenger went over the side . Sure , you 're going to take all of the other steps discussed in this column , but you also need to plan that turn . Fortunately , the U.S. Navy came up with the Williamson Turn ( at right ) . After you 've noted the compass heading you were on , take a heading 60 degrees from that course to the side of the boat that the person fell from , if that information is known . When you acquire that course , come hard over in the other direction , about 240 degrees . You should then be on the reciprocal of the original course . For instance , if you were heading due north ( 360 degrees ) when you lost your passenger to starboard , you would come to a heading of 60 degrees . Then , you 'd come hard port and count the degrees until the boat made a 240-degree course change  --  which would be 180 degrees . PULLQUOTE The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
