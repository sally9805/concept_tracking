<p> Memphis , Tennessee , 1975 <p> <p> " Shit , " said Patricia .. It was an understatement . <p> <p> " Yes , ma'am , " her assistant Joe agreed , and scowled at the musty odor , strong despite the morgue 's chill . <p> <p> The body inside the enormous coffin had the unmistakable look of someone buried alive . The limbs twisted in the folds of dry , brittle clothing ; the jaw hung open in an eternal cry of despair . But the knife driven through his heart , still gleaming after more than half a century , was what held their attention . <p> <p> It was solid gold . <p> <p> Joe moved around the casket taking photographs . The hum of the flash recharger echoed in the silent room . Patricia took a magnifying glass from the table and leaned into the coffin to examine the knife . <p> <p> " Careful , " Joe said . " One wrong move , we 've got nothing but a big ol ' pile of dust . " <p> <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he had a point , and she forced herself to be extra cautious . <p> <p> At first she thought the knife was some ceremonial dagger , but a closer look showed it to be a crucifix , with an inscribed three-inch crosspiece and , visible between the ribs , a base sharpened to a point and flattened into a blade . The artwork was exquisite , with tiny Aramaic characters strongly suggesting a Middle Eastern origin . It was out of her area  --  she taught pathology  --  but she still knew impressive workmanship when she saw it . <p> <p> " Christ on a stick , " Joe said , and wrinkled his nose as he took the film from his camera . " So that 's really a "  --  he made an exaggerated frightened face  --  " vampire ? " <p> <p> " No , it 's a crime victim , " Patricia said . " See the knife ? He was murdered , allegedly by Sir Francis Colby , sixty years ago . " <p> <p> Joe put the camera aside . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Colby guy still alive or something ? " <p> <p> " No , he died quite some time ago . I 'm not sure why the museum wants it , but it should be interesting as a technical exercise . You do n't see many corpses like this . " <p> <p> " You mean ones that might rise from their coffins ? " <p> <p> Patricia scowled at him . " Did you read anything past the first paragraph of my memo ? " <p> <p> Joe rolled his eyes . " Yes . This is the corpse of Baron Zginski , the only man to have ever been legally proved to be a vampire . His trial was one of the first live broadcasts ever in Europe , but no recordings exist , and the various transcripts do n't agree on details . " <p> <p> " You can read , then . " <p> <p> " But why are we cutting into him now , after all this time ? " <p> <p> She shrugged . " Professional courtesy . Someone at the museum wants to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the state system , they do n't have to pay us extra . And you do n't get experience with a body in this condition very often , so if you 're serious about your education , you 'd do best to shut up and pay attention . " <p> <p> She ran her hand along the coffin 's firm , expensive wood overlay . The casket looked like a bulky version of a standard coffin , but they 'd had to use a forklift to move it from the Colby Archives ware house into the medical school 's morgue room to examine it . Under the paneling the coffin was solid metal , probably lead . <p> <p> " He looks . . . dried out , " Joe observed . " Not decayed . Mummified . " <p> <p> " Until the rubber dry-rotted , there was an airtight seal on this thing . The fluids drained out of the body while it was sealed , and when the rubber started to go , they evaporated . " <p> <p> " He does look like he has fangs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly enlarged canines , " Patricia countered . " My grandmother had teeth just like that and she was n't a vampire , either . " <p> <p> Her eye kept drifting back to the cross . If it was real . . . <p> <p> She forced her attention back to the moment . " Okay , we 're pathologists , time to pathologize . Let 's cook some tissue samples and see what really made everyone think this Baron Zginski was a vampire : porphyria , anemia , or just plain psychosis . " <p> <p> " There 's no chemical test for psychosis . " <p> <p> " Your point ? " <p> <p> " It 's nearly six o'clock . " <p> <p> " You have a date ? " <p> <p> He looked down . " No , " he said pathetically . <p> <p> " Well , you do now . With a Bunsen burner . " <p> <p> " I 'm your T.A. , not your slave , " he said . <p> <p> Patricia 's eyes widened in mock outrage . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of only three women . But she 'd worked with Joe long enough to know he had no idea how appallingly insensitive his remark , intended as a joke , might be . Maybe someday this would change , but now , in 1975 , she decided to simply treat it as intended . <p> <p> " All right , all right , I 'm going , " Joe said , and went to gather the test tubes . <p> <p> Two hours later , while Joe prepared the tissue samples in the lab , Patricia went into the empty teacher 's lounge , poured the last of the god-awful coffee , and settled onto the green vinyl couch . The museum curator had been kind enough to send along Sir Francis Colby 's original documentation on the Zginski case , in which Colby had been prosecutor ( and executioner , as it turned out ) . She opened the folder and read the first yellowed , handwritten page . <p> <p> 16 June 1915 <p> <p> Passelwaithe nestled amongst the Welsh hills , almost cut off from any sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the town square and look in any direction , only green hills and grey sky would greet you . The people were equally isolated , aware of the modern world but preferring to exist in the superstitious netherregions of their ancestors . Magic still existed in Passelwaithe , or at least the belief in magic persisted . <p> <p> I journeyed to Passelwaithe in response to a cryptic summons from one Arthur Jermin , the local physician . He 'd been referred to me by Professor Alistair , and his letter described a problem so unusual I was unable to resist . I arrived just before sundown , as requested . It was a relief to be away from London , after the zeppelin air raids at the first of the month . Here in Wales , no trace of the ghastly war could be found . <p> <p> The town seemed to be deserted as I climbed from my motorcar . Usually the sight of the great rumbling beast , technology 's dire imitation of the horse , drew entire populations . I lit a cigar and waited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that is , as rakish as a man my age could be . <p> <p> In a few moments another man , as middle-aged and portly as I , literally skulked towards me , checking frequently behind him . Finally he stood erect and made an effort to reclaim his dignity . ' Sir Francis ? ' he asked . <p> <p> ' Indeed , ' I said . ' And you are Dr. Jermin ? ' <p> <p> ' Quite . Come , let 's get inside , in case  --  ' He caught himself before giving away too much , and I followed him into the nearest building . <p> <p> A typically Welsh choice , it turned out to be the local pub , and the entire male population of Passelwaithe filled it . Dark , muscular men with faces like battered gargoyles , they gazed upon me with an expectancy almost religious in its intensity . Dr. Jermin stepped forward . <p> <p> ' We have only a few minutes of safety left to us , lads , ' Dr. Jermin announced . ' This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here to rid us of our problem . Is that not correct ? ' <p> <p> ' I must know this problem first , ' I demurred . <p> <p> ' It 's that devil , the Baron ! ' one man cried . <p> <p> ' Aye , Baron Zginski ! ' echoed another . <p> <p> ' And who is Baron Zginski ? ' I demanded . <p> <p> ' A vampire , ' a man in a cleric 's collar stated . ' An unholy being who survives on the blood of the living . And he 'll be the ruin of us all if he 's not stopped . ' <p> <p> Having been briefed somewhat by Professor Alistair , I was not entirely surprised . The grip of superstition was still firm in Passelwaithe . Indeed , they knew me only as a spiritualist , not understanding that my primary mission was to expose fraud and misinterpretation . <p> <p> ' True vampires , ' I said carefully , ' are not native to this land . They exist only in isolated central European districts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it one may be found here ? ' <p> <p> ' He came to us as a rich immigrant , ' Dr. Jermin explained , ' claiming to have been disenfranchised by the war , and to have barely escaped with his life and fortune . That was six months ago . Since then , our wives and daughters have begun exhibiting strange behaviour . Our young men are disheartened and morose . And all due to this . . . this foreigner ! ' <p> <p> A grumble of assent rose from the gathered menfolk . <p> <p> I understood all too well the dynamic at work here . ' Tell me , is this Baron Zginski a young man ? ' <p> <p> The priest nodded . ' He appears young , yes . And handsome as the very devil . Yet rumours say he is centuries old . ' <p> <p> I considered my words carefully . This young , rich Continental Europe an was clearly such a threat to the stolid males of Passelwaithe that they 'd inferred supernatural origins to his attractiveness . Inwardly I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> <p> ' Gentlemen , ' I said , ' if this Baron is all you say , we must proceed with caution . Vampires are the devil 's own tricksters , and  --  ' <p> <p> ' Very little gets past them , ' a new voice said . <p> <p> A dashing , debonair young man stood in the doorway . Of medium height , slender , with raven-black hair and moustache , he dominated the room with his blazing eyes . The royal blood of Europe clearly flowed in his veins , and he stood for our inspection as if he were used to such scrutiny . His clothing was more appropriate for a Parisian salon than a Welsh pub , but he wore it with ease and flair . <p> <p> ' Sir Francis Colby , I believe ? ' he said in a light Eastern European accent . <p> <p> I stepped forward . ' Indeed . Baron Zginski ? ' <p> <p> ' Baron Rudolfo Vladimir Zginski , ' he said with a bow . ' At your ser vice . I understand my neighbours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man at whom he gazed directly immediately turned away . <p> <p> ' Some concerns , I believe , ' I said in as conciliatory a tone as I could muster . ' I 'm certain at the root it 's mere misunderstanding . ' <p> <p> ' No doubt , ' Zginski said . He had none of the pomp of royalty , but rather an unassuming quality that was most endearing . ' When I heard you were to visit , I thought between the two of us we might clear this whole thing up . Your reputation for discovering the truth in such matters is spotless . ' <p> <p> ' Devil , ' someone muttered . <p> <p> ' Incubus , ' came another voice . <p> <p> Zginski smiled . His teeth were quite white , quite even . He said , ' I am open to any suggestion you make , Sir Francis . I wish only to live in peace with my neighbours , in my adopted country . ' <p> <p> ' Very well . I suggest , then , that at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We shall , Baron Zginski , put you on trial for the crime of being a vampire . Because of my experience in such matters , I shall act as prosecutor . ' <p> <p> Zginski clearly understood my meaning . ' And I shall defend myself , Sir Francis , ' he said with a slight smile , ' with the mere truth . ' <p> <p> ' Is there a magistrate ? ' I asked Dr. Jermin . <p> <p> A white-haired gentleman announced , ' I am the magistrate . Alun Toomley . ' <p> <p> ' Very well . I shall return at this time tomorrow evening , at which time we shall meet here to settle this . Oh , and incidentally  --  while I shall abide by any ruling you make , sir , I shall take steps to insure no prior prejudice will be allowed to operate . Baron Zginski will be judged on the facts alone . ' <p> <p> Baron Zginski nodded his assent and departed . Conversation resumed around us , low and bitter and menacing . I motioned Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' This is not an example of Christian charity , ' I said quietly . ' That young man is rich , handsome , and , I assume , unmarried . That is why your village menfolk feel threatened . ' <p> <p> ' I thought so at first , too , Sir Francis . Yet why would a rich , handsome bachelor pick such a tiny , out-of-the-way village ? Why not London , or Glasgow ? ' <p> <p> ' Perhaps he has different priorities , ' I said . <p> <p> Jermin considered carefully before he spoke . ' Or perhaps he was aware that , in all of the United Kingdom , no village has as large a population of women . I 've lived here for forty years , and attended births for nearly that long . In that time , daughters have outnumbered sons almost three to one , and the isolation we face here has kept most of them unmarried . If I were a young , handsome rich man , this would be an ideal location . And if I were also a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pint of bitters . ' Your fingers clutch at the proverbial straws , Dr. Jermin . Vampirism is a superstition , nothing more . Tomorrow night , we shall prove it . ' <p> <p> ' I thought you were to be the prosecutor . ' <p> <p> ' And I shall be . I shall submit Baron Zginski to every test of vampirism I know . And when he passes them all , we shall have settled this nonsense . Agreed ? ' <p> <p> ' Agreed , ' Jermin said reluctantly . <p> <p> As I drove from Passelwaithe , two things impinged on my consciousness . One was Dr. Jermin 's description of the male-to-female ratio in the village ; it was , indeed , an ideal situation for a male creature that fed on living blood . <p> <p> The other was a moonlit glimpse , nothing more , of two figures on a hill , clutched in an embrace . One was a slender , dark-clad man , as Baron Zginski was . The other was smaller , paler , and unmistakably feminine . The second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . <p> <p> At the time , I convinced myself they were merely lovers meeting for a tryst . Subsequent events would prove otherwise . <p> <p> Joe tapped on the lounge door and opened it . " You decent ? " <p> <p> " Much as I ever am , " Patricia said . <p> <p> " Everything 's running right now , so we should have basic toxicology screens pretty soon . I 'm going to get something to eat , if that 's cool . You want anything ? " <p> <p> She stood and stretched . " No . I 'll probably be down in the morgue when you get back . " <p> <p> " Hanging out with the guest of honor ? " <p> <p> " Sometimes you spot new things if you keep looking . Have fun , but be back in an hour . " <p> <p> " Yes , massah , " Joe said . Patricia merely sighed . <p> <p> For reasons she could n't really pinpoint , Patricia wanted to read the rest of this story in the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was morbid , but she was a pathologist , and she 'd done her thesis on historical murders . Besides , being a black professional woman in Memphis , she knew just how strong provincial resentment could be ; she felt like she and Zginski had something in common . Had anything really changed between 1915 and 1975 ? Different was still different , and still feared and hated . <p> <p> She closed the door , buttoned her lab coat against the cold , and dragged a chair next to the coffin . <p> <p> As promised , I returned to Passelwaithe the following evening with two security measures . One was quite obvious  --  I brought along an army signalman and his broadcasting apparatus . Passelwaithe was too wrapped up in itself , and this connection with the outside world would prevent any hysterical mob violence . The experiment served two masters : it provided the scrutiny needed to insure justice was done , and it allowed the military to test aspects of their latest equipment with a broadcast of such absurdity that no spy could take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against a possibility so outlandish I chose to keep it my secret . <p> <p> By prior arrangement , Dr. Signalman Reynolds and I arrived , quite a crowd had already gathered outside the low building , trying to peer through the closed blinds and locked doors . <p> <p> At the sight of the gathered masses , Signalman Reynolds immediately perked up , straightened his uniform , and put on his best winning smile . The image of Mercury on his cap badge accented his jaunty air . The group clustered outside the tavern was exclusively female , and all frowned with desperate concern . The women and girls of Passelwaithe had gathered there to learn what fate their bitter , jealous men had in store for the handsome stranger who had brought excitement into their isolated and dreary lives . <p> <p> The women parted ranks to let us through . I noted another curious detail : a full third of the women wore neck kerchiefs or scarves , an unlikely fashion and certainly not due to inclement weather in this warm Welsh summer . The bescarved women all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasting illness . <p> <p> Reynolds lugged his portable wireless unit into the tavern , where the unruly menfolk clustered in little grumbling knots . Baron Zginski sat in the corner , in a large isolated chair , as if either a prisoner or some sort of exhibit . He seemed unmoved by the open hostility around him , and perhaps even a bit amused . Dr. Jermin stood nearby , and I nodded to him as we entered . <p> <p> Signalman Reynolds established communication with his unit and confirmed the broadcast connection . Magistrate Toomley called the assembly to order , and I stood before them to make my opening pronouncement . <p> <p> ' Gentlemen of Passelwaithe , to night we shall enter the modern age together . This is Signalman Reynolds of His Majesty 's armed forces . He shall supervise the broadcast of this proceeding , so the entire outside world will be aware of what goes on here . And I shall aid you in dispelling this superstitious nonsense once and for all . ' A few dissident grumbles were heard , but most said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar counter . ' I hereby open this meeting of the Passelwaithe Town Council . Our first item of business is the charge against Baron Rudolfo Zginski of being a vampire . Sir Francis ? ' <p> <p> Dr. Jermin had provided me with a list of the most vitriolic accusers . ' I call Arvel Walker as my first witness , ' I said . <p> <p> I will refrain from boring the reader with a detailed account of the witnesses against Zginski . Enough to say that , to a man , they presented evidence not of supernatural evil , but of very mortal jealousy and resentment . My irrational misgivings of the previous night faded with each man who spoke . <p> <p> After the testimony , I established that Dr. Jermin had that very day , and on numerous other occasions , seen Baron Zginski moving about during the hours before sunset ( the very reason I 'd arranged for the good doctor to be Zginski 's escort ) . Although the tradition varied a bit , most authorities agreed that vampires stayed motionless and inert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glimpse of its cleansing light would be enough to destroy them . <p> <p> I reminded the assembly that several witnesses had testified that the Baron easily crossed streams and rivers . In folklore , running water formed an impenetrable barrier to vampires . <p> <p> Finally it was my turn to question the Baron himself . First I asked him to eat some garlic , which he did . Then I held a mirror up to him , which clearly cast his reflection . I sprinkled holy water on him ; it caused no damage . The Baron was calm , confident , perhaps even amused by these bits of folklore , as any normal man would be . Still , something in his demeanor struck an odd chord . <p> <p> Nonetheless , I went ahead with my most theatrical test . A virgin white mare was brought into the room . If Zginski had been a traditional vampire , the horse would have become quite violently agitated . She merely looked around the room and waited patiently to be led away . <p> <p> The crowd was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their resentment , Zginski 's wealth and handsomeness , and this did not sit well . As Toomley asked meekly if anyone had any other evidence to present , I surreptitiously studied Zginski , attempting to identify what about him disturbed me so . <p> <p> Suddenly I isolated it . The man was not breathing . <p> <p> Impulsively I took his wrist and felt for a pulse . By the time he yanked his arm away , I 'd learned the truth . <p> <p> ' Great guns ! ' I ejaculated . ' He is a vampire ! ' <p> <p> The room collectively gasped . Zginski regarded me with a look of superior disdain . ' What ever , ' he said calmly , ' are you on about ? ' <p> <p> Dr. Jermin leapt to his feet . ' Heavens above , Colby , are you certain ? ' <p> <p> I met Zginski 's cold , lifeless gaze . ' Beyond any reason , ' I said , and before he could respond , withdrew my revolver and fired point-blank into his chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the room . Zginski remained in the chair , eyes wide , then looked down at the smoking hole in his expensive waistcoat . Before he could react , I turned to the assembled roomful of gaping Welsh mouths and said , ' As you can see , he has been shot point-blank and yet does not bleed , nor has he registered any pain . ' Facing Zginski , I concluded , ' Your concealment was almost perfect . But now you have been exposed . ' <p> <p> Zginski smiled weakly and started to speak . Then , with no warning , he leapt to his feet , his face twisted into a mask of fury and animal intensity . He grasped me by the throat in a grip of iron , his eyes blazing with demonic power , and pushed me against the nearest wall . <p> <p> ' Fool ! ' he hissed . ' No one need have died this night , if not for you ! Now I shall slaughter them all , and you shall be the first ! ' <p> <p> His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immense physical strength , he failed to note the second security mea sure as I produced it from within my waistcoat . He did notice , however , when I plunged it into his heart above the still-smoking bullet hole . <p> <p> Instantly he stumbled back , clawing at his chest . It took mere moments for him to collapse and , at last , expire on the floor , his body frozen in twisted agony . <p> <p> I glanced at Signalman Reynolds . He was as pale as Baron Zginski 's now-lifeless corpse . <p> <p> I knelt by the fallen vampire . Protruding from his chest was a golden cross , a crucifix found by Richard the Lionheart on his first crusade to the Holy Land , blessed both in Jerusalem and later in Rome . A metalsmith monk in a distant cloister had reshaped it into a thin-bladed dagger for me , and it had proven too sharp indeed for the luckless continental nosferatu . <p> <p> Patricia put the manuscript aside and pulled on surgical gloves . She leaned over the coffin and examined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage was so slight it was barely visible : just a tiny , thin slit where the blade parted the flesh . She took the handle in two fingers and gently pulled the cross from the corpse . It slid away easily , although she felt a little tingle when it finally pulled free , like a tiny arc of electricity just strong enough to pierce the rubber gloves . When she looked back , the injury had vanished into the folds of the wrinkled , dry flesh . <p> <p> The cross rested in her hand , solid and heavy , the sharpened end stained black with sixty-year-old blood . She held it under the illuminated magnifier , studying the wealth of detail carved into the soft metal . This was a genuine piece of art , and would make a magnificent display in the university museum . She placed it carefully in a plastic bag , sealed it , and put it on the nearest examination table . It looked even more unreal and majestic against the cold , flat stainless steel . She removed her gloves and turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was charged with murder at the official inquest , but had two factors in my favour . One was , of course , a roomful of witnesses who supported my claim of self-defence . The other was the report of the official examination by Dr. Jermin , establishing that the rate of decomposition in Zginski 's body was consistent with a body that had actually died at least thirty years earlier . No one could explain that , of course , but neither could anyone dispute it . <p> <p> How could Zginski have been a vampire , and yet passed all the classic tests ? I can only assume that vampires , like other creatures , are capable of evolving and adapting . <p> <p> Baron Rudolfo Zginski was understandably refused Christian burial in the local cemetery . As there was no identifiable next of kin , I claimed the body and stored it in my cellar . I sealed it in an iron coffin , grounded through a lightning rod . I considered burning the body , which is the only way to be thoroughly certain a vampire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singular character , I could not bring myself to do so . He had learned to mimic human behaviour to an astounding degree , and forced me to rethink many things about which I was previously certain . I knew that as long as the cross remained imbedded in his heart , the world was safe . <p> <p> Patricia 's heart raced with excitement . This could be her academic ticket out of this backwater college if she could identify some rational , physiological explanation for the events Colby described , something that showed the face of prejudice in 1915 Wales as clearly as she knew it in 1975 Tennessee . After all , vampires did n't exist , so it simply could n't be that . <p> <p> She looked up with a start . An overpowering odor suddenly filled the room . It was no chemical she could identify , or any organic process she recognized . She jumped to her feet and peered into the morgue 's darker corners , looking for a spilled bottle or leaking container . Then she gingerly approached the air-conditioning vent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a relief . The danger in any educational environment was that some careless or stoned student might accidentally mix two harmless substances into something lethal , and if those fumes got into the ventilation system it could hurt a lot of people . <p> <p> The odor was , in fact , the scent of recomposition . Its unique tang was reminiscent of ripening fruit , meat being warmed over a slow fire , and blood pulsing from an open wound . It was the olfactory by-product of a process so rare that only a handful of people in all human history had ever witnessed it , although none had survived to document it . The fumes themselves were harmless ; it was what they heralded that uniformly proved lethal . <p> <p> The smell began to fade almost at once . Patricia sighed with relief ; what ever it was , it was neither extensive nor , apparently , dangerous . Probably the residue of some cleaning chemicals mixed by accident in the garbage elsewhere in the building . She turned her attention back to Colby 's manuscript . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She could only use excerpts from Sir Francis 's narrative in her professional paper . What ever his other skills , one thing was painfully obvious . <p> <p> Sir Francis Colby could n't write worth a da  --  <p> <p> Excerpted from BLOOD GROOVE by Alex Bledsoe Copyright 2009 by Alex Bledsoe Published in May 2009 by Tom Doherty Associates ,
