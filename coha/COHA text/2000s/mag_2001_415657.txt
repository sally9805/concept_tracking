Waxing , zapping , shaving , plucking , tweezing-which one 's best for you ? // We love it on our heads but hate it pretty much everywhere else . In fact , we 'll try just about anything to get rid of unwanted body hair . Toward that end , we allow hot wax to be dripped on our skin then ripped off . We tweeze and pluck till there 's next to nothing left . We pay lavishly , in dollars and tears , to have it lasered off . And yet , as much of an indignity as hair removal can be , few of us are willing to go au natural . Vanity , thy name is perfect hair . So just in time for summer-the season in which we bare the most skin-we 've compiled a complete guide to the most effective and advanced ways of banishing unwanted hair . Shortcuts Despite the latest advances , shaving is still the easiest , safest and least expensive method of hair removal . In fact , it 's the preferred method of 88 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hurt . All you need is a razor ( ideally a triple-blade , to prevent nicks ) and shaving cream , to keep skin smooth and moisturized and to prevent irritation . ( In a pinch , of course , you can make do with foamy soap . ) If possible , choose moisturizing creams with olive , avocado or coconut oil and soothing ingredients like aloe vera gel . The trick to close shaving is to wet your skin with warm water first to soften the hairs , making them easier to remove . The downside to shaving is that hair grows back within a few days . Waxing Poetic If you ca n't stand shaving every day or so , then waxing may be the way to go . You can either get it done at a salon ( $30 to $80 a visit , depending on how much hair you 're removing ) or do it yourself in the " comfort " of your own bathroom . For home waxers , here 's how to do it : First , spread melted wax over unwanted hair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloth off . Be sure to apply powder to your skin first , says Maggie Santos of the J. Sisters International Salon in New York City . Dusting with a cornstarch-based product before waxing will help prevent sensitive skin from becoming irritated . Santos also recommends pine- or honey-based waxes because they are gentler on the skin . Beeswax-based products are good for sensitive skin , too-and most are all natural . The downside : It hurts , though you do n't have to do it very often-about every four to six weeks . You need to let your hair grow at least a quarter of an inch before getting waxed ( the wax grabs longer hair easier ) , meaning you may have to go " hairy " for a little while . To avoid the common problem of ingrown hairs , exfoliate religiously ( see " Take It Off , Take It All Off , " p. 73 ) . Zap It Electrolysis is a technique whereby a licensed electrologist inserts a hair-thin needle ( connected to an electricity source ) into the hair follicle . Then she turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As time consuming as this process is , it 's the closest you can get to permanent hair removal . But it ca n't remove it all at once . " It takes about a full year of regular 15- to 30-minute visits to get rid of all the hair , " says Teresa E. Petricca , Certified Professional Electrologist ( C.P.E. ) , executive director of the American Electrology Association ( AEA ) in Trumbull , Conn . Since electrolysis targets hair in different growth phases , clients start off by going twice a week for a few weeks , then once a week for several more weeks , then once a month for up to a year . While you can have electrolysis done on any area of the body , the face and bikini line are the most popular . The cost : About $1 a minute . The only potential downside is that if you go to someone who 's not trained properly , you run the risk of scarring from improper use of the needle and electricity .

Going Techno If you 'd like to get rid of a lot of body hair and are willing to pay the price , you might consider the latest hair removal technique : lasers . When lasers were first introduced , they could only be used on people with dark hair and light skin . ( The pigment in the hair follicle is what attracts-and absorbs-the laser light . The heat generated by the laser is transmitted to the hair roots , which damages or destroys the hair 's growth center . ) And until recently , whenever lasers were used on people with dark hair and dark skin , the light would get absorbed by areas outside the hair follicle and cause a loss of skin pigmentation , as well as blisters and scars . " Now the newest lasers can work on all skin types because they 're not pigment-specific , " explains New York City dermatologist and laser specialist Melanie Grossman , M.D. Typically , the treatment is conducted in a series of five to eight sessions ( one to two weeks apart ) , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair is be removed . " Over time , there 's a progressive reduction in the amount of hair that grows , " says New York City dermatologist Alan Kling , M.D. " But there will never be a permanent 100 percent reduction in all hair growth . " Photograph // Laser hair removal is expensive : $200 to $1,000 for the entire treatment-depending on the area you want done . Mild skin redness is possible after the procedure , for which Kling usually prescribes a 1 percent cortisone cream . It also stings quite a bit ( like rubber bands snapping at your skin ) , though Grossman says most of the patients she 's treated can take it . Nevertheless , you should be prepared for some degree of discomfort . Just Plucky When it comes to eyebrows , most women still consider tweezing to be the best option . You can have it done in a salon by a professional for upwards of $50 a visit , or you can do it at home quite effortlessly . You 'll need sharp tweezers and , for the most effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " p. 72 ) , which are placed over the brow as a guide . " A common mistake is that people tweeze too much , " says Rami Gafni , a New York City-based makeup artist , brow expert and director of Rami Beauty Therapy . Stencils will help prevent over-tweezing , but Gafni offers this advice : " If you 're unsure about a hair , wait a few days and if it needs to go , it will be apparent . " Tweezing is also a great way to deal with a few rebellious hairs at a time , like those you 've missed from waxing or shaving . Tweezing does sting a little , but the pain is short-lived . Try plucking ofter a hot shower , when the follicle is open and the hair is easier to remove . Tweezed areas stay hair-free for a week or so , and you can pluck them as soon as you can grip them with the tweezers . A magnifying mirror can help you spot them early . Well-Thread For a completely natural ( but temporary ) way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line , try threading . This little-known but effective Indian hair-removal technique must be performed by trained professionals . Here 's how it works : The technician ( usually employed by a hair salon ) dusts a bit of powder on the skin . She then takes a piece of cotton sewing thread and twists and loops it around each hair strand , pulling the hair out from its root . ( It feels the same as tweezing-like a needle prick . ) The powder helps the thread grip the hair more easily . Because it 's so timeconsuming , threading is best for small areas like the eyebrows or bikini line . Threading averages $15 ( for eyebrows ) to $30 ( for the bikini area ) and lasts two to three weeks . Check with your salon to see if it offers this service .

Ingrown hairs develop when hair is removed and the new hair curls and grows back into the broken skin . " This is when inflammation and blemishes occur " says Alan Dattner , M. , D. , a naturopathic dermatologist in New Rochelle , NY To avoid this , regularly exfoliate with a loofah ( a natural-bristle bath scrub ) , a granular scrub ( one that contains ground-up particles of apricot or mango seeds or salt ) or a fruit-acid-based lotion . Fruit acids like salicylic or glycolic acid help slough off pore-clogging dead skin cells , preventing the hair from growing too far into the follicle in the first place , says Dattner . But do n't apply fruit acid-based lotions or exfoliating salt scrubs immediately after shaving or waxing ; the skin is too sensitive and could sting from the products . * Do n't wax , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking Accutane or using Retin-A or Renova.These products make the outer layer of the skin thin and sensitive and therefore more prone to redness and scarring . If you 're getting laser hair removal , do n't take aspirin for 10 days prior to your treatment , since it thins the blood and can make you more prone to bruising . * Avoid hair-removal methods ( except shaving ) the week before your period . when the skin is more sensitive due to fluctuating hormones . And do n't use any method if you have a sunburn * Replace your razor blade every two to three weeks . Using a dull blade irritates the skin . Never shave on dry skin ; always wet it first and use shaving cream . * Soothe skin with botanicals after hair removal . " Chamomile and calendula are soothing to irritated skin , " explains Dattner . So are astringents like witch hazel and aloe vera , adds Dawn Gallagher , author of Naturally Beautiful ( Universe , 1999 ) .
