<p> Back in December 1998 , editors across America had us believing there was an evil plot afoot by " powerful forces " and " heavy political hitters " in Congress . But , rather than a subversive cabal , it was just some sharp congressmen awakened to the fact that our dollar bills are just an expensive habit . <p> The time was ripe to dump the dollar bill . It remains to this day an anachronism , and its replacement costs to the government are still excessive . Dollar bills wear out in no time , and worn and torn bills are the ultimate frustration in vending machines . <p> A new dollar coin should have been the ticket to guide us beyond the realm of dollar bills . A dollar coin 's durability can save America hundreds of millions of dollars in mint and engraving costs . Vending machine frustrations would be history . <p> Large-value coins have been successfully used in Britain , where the 1-pound coin easily replaced the diminutive 1-pound note . In Paris , I grew quite fond of the 10- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectively ) and found them much easier to carry and use than their paper counterparts . <p> Putting our national heroes on dollar coins is much more than a " dubious honor . " The new Sacagawea coin could have provided a step in the right direction , just as the coin 's namesake did for Lewis and Clark . <p> Alas , political correctness in the Clinton administration required a big coin to show off the likeness of an Indian woman instead of some dead presidents . Their idiotic choice of a coin size too close to the quarter never gave the dollar coin a chance . <p> If cooler heads had prevailed against the tide of political correctness , and they had picked a smaller , thicker coin that took up less space in a purse or pocket , we could have finally put away these fragile and torn dollar bills forever . <p> I 'm ready to fold up and put away $1 bills . <p> Robert C. Gotshall Jr. , <p> Palm Bay , Fla . <p> Last week , Federal District Judge Wayne R. Andersen decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence " in its attempts to seize the assets of the Bridgeview-based Global Relief Foundation , which it accuses of helping Middle Eastern terrorists to get funds " Judge OKs secret evidence , " news story , April 6 . This is a mistake that will affect the constitutional rights of all in a negative way . <p> In and of itself , the political use of civil forfeiture legislation  --  under which the government grabs your property without a trial and you must go to court to get the property back  --  is a severe problem . By reversing the " burden of proof " ( forcing you to prove that you are innocent , instead of forcing the government to prove that you are guilty ) , civil forfeiture law represents a threat to due process . But when this is compounded by the use of " secret evidence " ( evidence that neither the accused nor his or her attorney is permitted to see ) in the trial that results , from the person or organization affected suing to retrieve their property , there is a real danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The use of secret evidence was made possible by the 1996 Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act . After this act was signed , the government moved to deport about 29 legal resident non-citizens . It was a fiasco : The effort blew up in the government 's face , because federal judges threw out the " secret evidence " in case after case . <p> In the cases of Palestinian immigrant Hany Kiareldeen and Florida resident Mazen al Najjar , the federal courts basically stated that the government was using the ploy of " secret evidence " to hide the fact that they had no evidence against the accused . <p> Prior to the 2000 elections , candidates Al Gore , George W. Bush and Ralph Nader all promised that if elected , they would put a stop to the use of secret evidence . But 9/11 changed all that : Al Najjar was rearrested without charges , and now " secret evidence " is going to be used to prevent organizations subjected to civil forfeiture from suing to clear their names and get their property back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " secret evidence " in question . Let us hope that his judicial training will let him decide justly as to whether the " secret evidence " is real evidence or bogus evidence . And we should all work to make sure that the use of " secret evidence " is prevented in the future . <p> Emile Schepers , <p> program director , <p> Chicago Committee <p> to Defend the Bill of Rights <p> I 'm a DCFS child abuse and neglect caseworker who could soon be laid off as a result of Gov . Ryan 's budget cuts . I think the Sun-Times March 27 editorial , " Union hurts its cause " is wrong to claim that my union is to blame for these layoffs . Like most of my co-workers , I support AFSCME 's stand against a wage freeze and forced furloughs . We know all too well that the amount of money involved in those concessions wo n't begin to close the state budget hole . And we know that from the outset the governor has never been willing to make a firm commitment that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his demands . <p> You should be asking questions about Ryan , not about our union . Why are all his layoffs targeted at front-line employees like me ? He 's sending out nearly 1,000 layoff notices and somehow he ca n't find one person among all of the patronage-ridden layers of management to lay off . Why does he say that a " deal 's a deal " in refusing to cut funding for legislators ' pork projects , but does n't seem to feel he has to honor the deal he made with us when he signed a contract committing to a pay raise ? <p> What 's really unfair is the governor 's overall approach to the state budget crisis . Instead of severely cutting back services that people need , such as health care and day care for low-income workers , he could be asking some of his big business allies to make concessions  --  like a modest tax increase on the huge profits raked in by riverboat casinos . <p> The governor and the Sun-Times could do all residents of Illinois a favor by considering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state 's economy by throwing thousands of people out of work or jeopardize the social safety net by cutting vital programs . <p> Bruce Thomas , <p> Child Welfare Advanced <p> Specialist , <p> Illinois Department of <p> Children and Family Services <p> An April 5th article reported that scientists are optimistic regarding a genetic map of rice having the potential to create strains capable of feeding the world 's hungry peoples " Genetic map of rice could fight hunger " . This seemingly idyllic panacea may take years to actualize . Meanwhile , we currently have an abundance of grains , vegetables , soybeans and legumes readily available to immediately fortify millions of starving humans . <p> The problem is that these aforesaid nutritious foods are being monopolized by the meat and poultry industries to fatten inhumanely treated cattle , pigs , lambs and birds . This outrageous scenario is counterproductive , cruel and ecologically devastating . If mistreated farm animals are granted liberation , ample food supplies will end human starvation ! We can throw excess rice as a means of celebration ! <p> Brien Comerford , Glenview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside mirror , inside rearview mirror and right side outside mirror . Vehicles and other objects seen in the right side outside mirror look farther away than they really are . I find this confusing and dangerous , and the possible cause of some serious accidents . <p> I believe that all mirrors should show the actual distances of vehicles in back of them  --  not just two out of three . <p> Sam J. Schneider , <p> Portage Park <p> I have written to my state legislators and to the governor to defeat the bill by Rep. Dan Burke ( D-Chicago ) that would allow the Segway Motorized Human Transporter access to the sidewalks . <p> I see in the Tuesday , April 2 edition of the Sun-Times that the bill was passed by the Statehouse . How can those who voted for the bill be so insensitive ? What argument could be more persuasive than that of safety ? <p> Sidewalks are for pedestrians . Well , at least they should be . I believe that even bicycles should not be allowed access to sidewalks . The only exception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rage is a problem because of the congested road system , wait till you see the sidewalk rage that will occur if these motorized human transporters are allowed on our sidewalks . <p> Bicycles , motorized scooters , the Human Transporters , inline skates , skateboards , and joggers should be relegated to their own lane on the street , and let them sort things out . <p> Robert Zielinski , Bridgeview
