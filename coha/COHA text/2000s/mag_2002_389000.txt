Within the cells , circulating lipoproteins , digestive fluids and elsewhere in the body , phospholipids co-occur and cofunction with antioxidants . The phospholipids ( pronounced fos-fo-lip-ids ) self-assemble into membranes and other multidimensional structures , together with antioxidants to protect them against oxidative destruction . This partnership between nutrient classes profoundly influences the health of the whole being . The cell membranes are dynamic molecular assemblies that house life 's plethora of biochemical processes . Our 100 trillion cells all rely on membranes to carry out their functions . Cell membrane organization is shown on the left of the illustration . Catalytic proteins are housed within a flexible bilayer ( two molecular sheets ) , the phospholipid matrix . The matrix also houses antioxidants , including tocopherols and tocotrienols of the vitamin E family ; lycopene , lutein and other carotenoids and ubiquinone ( coenzyme Q10 or CoQ ) . Also present is the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase , using selenium as its mineral cofactor . Phospholipids ( Pl. ) are the most biochemically-suited building blocks for membranes . The right side of the illustration shows the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( PhosphatidylSerine ) or PC ( PhosphatidylCholine ) . The fatty acid tails often are highly unsaturated and therefore susceptible to oxyradical or other oxidant attack . The more unsaturated the membrane , the more antioxidant protection is required . The PL head groups each bring special properties to the membrane . In PS the head group has serine , in PC it has choline . The " prophospholipid " GPC ( GlyceroPhosphoCholine ) has the choline head group but lacks fatty acid tails , and is absent from the membrane proper . PS is most concentrated in nerve cell membranes . Its head group associated with membrane proteins particularly crucial to nerve cell functions . These include : * The sodium-potassium AND calciummagnesium transporters that use up to 70 percent of all the cell 's energy ; * Enzymes for signal transduction-protein kinases and adenyl cyclases ; * Receptors , sensors for chemical transmitters ( acetylcholine , adrenaline , noradrenaline , serotonin , others ) , also for nerve growth factors ; * Proteins of the mitochondrial membranes , central to energetics . Here PS also is a backup for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health for the whole being . Double-blind trials ( 20 of them ) show PS a superior nutrient for memory support , for partial restoration of declining cognitive function , for coping with stress in the healthy young . Preliminary research suggests PS can improve attention , learning and behavior in children . The energy for life is generated in cell membranes . In the process oxygen radicals ( " oxyrads " ) are generated which are highly reactive . However good the antioxidant defenses are , some oxyrads escape control and attack membranes . Thus the brain , with its intense energy generation ( up to 60 percent of the body 's total ) , must continually renew its cell membranes . Antioxidants such as vitamins C and E , the minerals selenium , zinc and manganese , the energizers CoQ and alpha-lipoic acid , the carotenoids lutein and lycopene , standardized polyphenolic flavonoids and other food borne antioxidants , all synergize with PS to help optimize brain functions . The liver is our workhorse organ ; its cells contain a total eight football fields worth of membrane area , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detoxify foreign substances it generates a further oxidative load on top of its usual oxyrad burden . Oxidants from foods , viruses , pollutants and drugs challenge the liver 's antioxidant capacity . Though the healthy liver is well endowed with antioxidants , oxidant overload can kill cell membranes . Enter PC ( PhosphatidylCholine ) , the most common phospholipid of membranes . Dietary supplementation with PC has clinically important , sometimes lifesaving benefits for the liver . In eight double-blind clinical trials , PC protected the human liver against alcoholic inflammation , viral infection and toxic prescription drugs , markedly improving the speed and extent of patient recovery . // Large proteins immersed in a phospholipid matrix ( blue ) with antioxidants ( yellow ) // The liver also carries a substantial reserve of GPC , which is readily converted into PC to make membrane . It is the most bioavailable source of choline to help the liver cells regenerate and perhaps for similar reasons is highly concentrated in mother 's milk . Taken by mouth , GPC quickly clears the bloodbrain barrier to reach the brain . Working through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young , healthy subjects . In the middle-aged it benefits information processing and general mental focus . In the elderly it improves declining cognitive functions linked to circulatory damage . GPC 's support for nerve cell functions , including a protective role as osmotic buffer , make a convenient biochemical fit with the antioxidant defenses operative in the brain . Functional partnership between phospholipids and the antioxidants is not limited to membranes . The circulating lipoproteins produced in the liver ( HDL , LDL and others ) are made mostly from PL building blocks . Dietary PL facilitate normal , pro-homeostatic lipoprotein status , probably through their support of the liver . The LDL are the main vehicles for delivery of fat-soluble antioxidants-E , CoQ , alpha-lipoic , carotenoids , others-to the tissues . In all of 12 double-blind trials , phospholipid mixtures lowered abnormally high total- and LDL- cholesterol without harming the HDL levels . In another double-blind trial , PL significantly improved blood flow to the brain and improved abnormal platelet aggregation . These marked circulatory benefits of the IT clearly complement antioxidants ' benefits for the circulating lipoproteins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilitating digestion . The bile fluid is essential for fat digestion and absorption . Bile has a large content of Pi , , functioning with the antioxidant routine as micellizing agents to fully disperse the fat molecules . Fatty acids of the omega-3 or omega-6 class make up many of the phospholipid " tails . " These are held in position by their parent PL molecules while enzymes break away prostaglandins ( PG ) and other messenger molecules . Membrane antioxidants help regulate the PG formed , to support a favorable balance . The natural cofunctioning of phospholipids with antioxidants in our cells and tissues suggests combination supplements for synergistic benefits . In particular , a new technology ( NutriVail(TM) ) employs custom phospholipids to make monomolecular dispersions of antioxidants , with the aim of substantially enhanced bioavailability and unique clinical benefit .
