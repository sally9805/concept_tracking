<p> WASHINGTON  --  The dictator , who had survived the threats of one U.S. president , became increasingly defiant as he watched another president order a military build-up all around him and talk tough about invading . He spurned the secret offer of a life in exile . <p> When U.S. forces finally launched their midnight attack in 1989 , Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega was caught so unawares that he was in bed with his mistress . Now he 's sleeping in a federal prison in Miami  --  presumably sorry that he did n't catch a flight to Spain when he had the chance . <p> Now Saddam Hussein of Iraq faces a similar calculation : Fight or flee ? <p> In recent weeks , Saudi and Jordanian officials have pushed a plan for the Iraqi dictator to relocate , relinquishing power and averting a military showdown he seems sure to lose . The American public backs the idea by 2-to-1 . " It avoids a lot of problems , " Secretary of State Colin Powell told Congress Wednesday . <p> But the tantalizing prospect of chartering a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the administration and among those who have dealt with tyrants in the past . Saddam 's exile would n't eliminate the need for a U.S. military operation in Iraq to find and destroy his regime 's weapons of mass destruction . Many of his supporters in politics and the military presumably would remain behind , complicating a transition to democracy . <p> And it would leave the man known as the Butcher of Baghdad living in luxury in the Saudi desert or some Black Sea dacha , presumably protected from prosecution for the war crimes that Bush says he has committed against Kurds and Shiites . <p> One of the top U.S. officials who helped direct the negotiations with Noriega says he had mixed feelings when it did n't work out . " We would have taken the deal , but is Panama better off that he did n't ? " asks Bernard Aronson , an assistant secretary of State in the first Bush administration . " In some ways , yes . " <p> Officials are having a similar debate about the wisdom of giving Saddam a last-minute exit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. was discussing the prospect with several other countries , but the details were n't settled . " We are looking at the various aspects of such a strategy , asylum  --  where , with what protection , you know , exactly how you would operationalize this . " <p> The questions might be moot . CIA profilers who have studied the Iraqi leader doubt that he would ever agree to surrender power . He 's no Idi Amin , the former " Big Daddy " of Uganda , who these days holds court at the Hotel Al Waha in Jeddah , Saudi Arabia . After a stopover in Libya , he has been in Saudi Arabia on " an extended pilgrimage " since being ousted from Kampala in 1979 . <p> His brutal rule there left perhaps 300,000 dead . <p> Defiant but defanged <p> There are a surprising number of despots in exile around the globe , many ferried to their new homes in U.S. Air Force planes . Tyrants who ordered coups , crackdowns , torture and mass murder now live quietly in countries often chosen because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul mates . <p> They typically deny that their time is up until the last possible moment . Amin was almost lynched by Tanzanian troops before he agreed to a hurried exit . Mengistu Haile Mariam , who led the " Red Terror " campaign in Ethiopia , was literally pushed by army comrades on board a U.S. plane in 1991 after Eritrean rebels had entered the capital , Addis Ababa . <p> Even when they manage to leave , there 's no guarantee they are safe . Anastasio Somoza fled Nicaragua in 1979 for Paraguay only to be assassinated the next year by a Sandinista hit squad . Now his Paraguayan protector , Alfredo Stroessner , is in exile in Brazil . <p> Italian journalist Riccardo Orizio spent years tracking down a half-dozen ex-dictators who found safe haven . His slender book , Talk of the Devil , being published in the United States in April , details the mundane daily lives that he found among some of the world 's most notorious names from the past . <p> For the dictators , too , exile can be a mixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and shows off his new TV satellite dish . " I recite the Koran , play the organ , go swimming and fishing at a resort near the Yemeni border , " he says . " The fish there are delicious , believe me . " He laughs that reports of his brutality and even cannibalism in power were overblown . <p> * Jean-Claude Duvalier , made Haiti 's " President for Life " at age 19 and sent packing at 35 , practices voodoo and studies solar energy from his retreat in Paris . Despite the millions he reportedly salted away during his corrupt reign , he was for a time penniless and virtually homeless . But his financial situation has mysteriously eased . <p> * Mengistu , the Leninist dictator who is said to have strangled the aging Haile Selassie with his own hands in 1975 , lives in a nondescript suburb of Harare , Zimbabwe . But the political problems of his protector , Robert Mugabe , have made him uneasy . His next stop could be China or North Korea . <p> ' They all feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad lot , " Orizio says . " They all feel that they have been betrayed by a superior , more powerful and more immoral entity , who first used them , then discarded them . " Noriega and Duvalier blame the United States , Mengistu the Soviet Union . <p> The fallen dictators describe themselves as idealists . " Maybe as an idealist who was ready to commit any crime in order to pursue his ' ideal , ' " Orizio says . " But still an idealist . " <p> All deny or downplay the reports of their worst atrocities . They say they were trying to protect their homelands from one threat or another . Some say history will prove them right . Duvalier discusses what he will do when he returns to power  --  a prospect envisioned by few outside his household . <p> Orizio adds a coda to his book about his unsuccessful efforts to line up one last interview . He had sent a letter describing his desire to talk to " certain ' forgotten individuals , ' once-powerful people who have been blamed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The defiant written response : " I do not consider myself to be a ' forgotten individual ' because God , the great Creator of the universe , He who writes straight albeit with occasionally crooked lines , has not yet written the last word on MANUEL A. NORIEGA ! " <p> Let 's make a deal ? <p> The first suggestion of a soft landing for Noriega came from the Miami defense attorney who was handling the Panamanian leader 's indictment in 1988 on cocaine trafficking , racketeering and money laundering charges . The lawyer contacted Michael Kozak , a deputy assistant secretary of State who had met Noriega when he was on the U.S. team negotiating the turnover of the Panama Canal . Was a deal possible ? <p> Kozak reported the overture to Aronson , who discussed it with then-secretary of State James Baker , who raised it with the first President Bush . They decided that the United States would n't dismiss Noriega 's criminal indictment but would look the other way if he left peacefully and settled in a nation that did n't have an extradition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance . <p> U.S. diplomats sought and received assurances of cooperation from Spanish officials . The back-channel talks with Noriega continued for weeks . But they faltered because the leader , who had defied President Reagan , never believed Bush would actually invade . <p> " He thought we were bluffing , " Aronson says . " If he could restrain Ronald Reagan , who had invaded Grenada and bombed Libya and talked tough to the Soviets , he figured if he had gone eyeball-to-eyeball and survived the Reagan administration , all the Americans were going to do is huff and puff , and nothing was going to happen . " <p> When U.S. forces finally stormed the capital just before Christmas in 1989 , Noriega was sent running from his mistress ' house , buttoning his shirt and pulling up his pants . For 10 days , he holed up in the Vatican Embassy before surrendering and being taken to the United States for prosecution . Convicted in 1992 , he is imprisoned at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Miami . <p> Some analysts see striking parallels between the deliberations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Exile for Noriega would have prevented the bloodshed of a war and the controversy of a military intervention , Aronson says . But it also would have left the old power structure intact . " The process of democratization would have been much more difficult , " he said . " The thugs would have still had the guns . " <p> What 's more , the decisive show of force by the United States turned out to have beneficial repercussions through the region , he says . It helped bolster Colombians who were battling drug cartels , pressure the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua to allow fair elections and persuade guerrillas in El Salvador to negotiate . <p> Now , some analysts say allowing Saddam to move into exile could have damaging ramifications . " If you remove Saddam , his regime of 10,000 co-conspirators or partners-in-crime would stay and run the show , " says Paul Williams , a former State Department lawyer . He helped create the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal that is prosecuting former Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic for genocide . <p> An exile deal for Saddam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him from prosecution for war crimes . That would erode U.S. moral authority  --  after all , Bush describes the conflict with Saddam as one between good and evil  --  and undermine efforts to establish democracy in a unified Iraq , Williams says . <p> The Americans who have dealt with Saddam doubt he will ever agree to go . There are even reports that Jordanian officials believe his intransigence could be used to advantage . The theory : If Saddam rejects an exile deal for him and his inner circle , that could increase the odds of a coup by Iraqi generals anxious to save their own skins . <p> Heroes ' do n't run from fights ' <p> Joe Wilson was the top U.S. diplomat in Baghdad when Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait in 1990 . He met with Saddam several times and negotiated the release of hundreds of Americans and other hostages as the United States moved toward the first Persian Gulf War . On the eve of war , he says , he heard rumors that Saddam had shifted some financial assets to Mauritania , in northwest Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Look at the ways he views himself as the natural heir to Saladin and Nebuchadnezzar , " great warriors and heroes from the long-ago past , Wilson says . " You do n't run from fights . " <p> The chances of Saddam leaving voluntarily " are between zero and none , " says Jerrold Post , a psychiatrist and founding director of the CIA 's Center for Personality and Clinical Behavior , which prepares psychological profiles of foreign leaders . " The only meaningful life for him is life in power . Having tasted the limelight of international attention and being able to be seen to have the courage to stand up to George the first and now George the second , there is part of him that relishes being this radical Arab world leader . " <p> There 's one exception , Post says : Saddam just might agree to a strategic retreat . That is , he might go if he thought he could then plot his triumphant return . <p> Where are they now ? <p> Some of the world 's most notorious dictators are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amin , Uganda <p> As many as 300,000 Ugandans were murdered during his years in power . When Ugandan nationalists and Tanzanian troops invaded , " Big Daddy " fled first to Libya in 1979 , then to Saudi Arabia . Now lives in Jeddah , Saudi Arabia , with his wife and children " on an extended pilgrimage . " He exercises at a gym , recites the Koran , plays the accordian and enjoys fishing , swimming and dancing . <p> Jean-Claude Duvalier , Haiti <p> Inherited the job of " President for Life " from his father , " Papa Doc , " at age 19 . Despite international pressure , " Baby Doc " failed to moderate the corruption of his father 's regime and the tyranny of the Tonton Macoutes , his personal police . Fled in 1986 to Paris , where he studies solar energy , worships voodoo , maintains a Web site and dreams of a comeback . <p> Mengistu Haile Mariam , Ethiopia <p> Arranged the murder of the emperor Haile Selassie and presided over the " Red Terror , " which killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as rebels closed in on Addis Ababa . Now lives in a suburb of Harare , Zimbabwe , under the protection of ally Robert Mugabe . <p> Slobodan Milosevic , Yugoslavia <p> A Communist functionary who became president of Serbia ; his nationalist policies contributed to the breakup of Yugoslavia . He backed Serb forces ' " ethnic cleansing " against Muslims in Bosnia . Indicted in May 1999 for war crimes against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo . Now on trial for genocide at the International Court of Justice in The Hague . <p> Manuel Noriega , Panama <p> Accused of drug trafficking and political assassination in his days as a military leader . He nullified the results of a presidential election in 1989 . When the United States invaded , he took refuge in the Vatican Embassy but then surrendered . Convicted in Miami of drug charges , he is in federal prison there . He could be released as early as 2007 . <p> Source : Talk of the Devil , by Riccardo Orizio and USA TODAY research
