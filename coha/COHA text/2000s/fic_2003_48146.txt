Paolo Bacigalupi made his first appearance in our pages back in 1998 with " A Pocketful of Dharma . " After several years of working in other genres , he has found his way back to sf with vivid results . See if the central image in this story does n't stay with you . <p> THE FLUTED GIRL HUDDLED in the darkness clutching Stephen 's final gift in her small pale hands . Madame Belari would be looking for her . The servants would be sniffing through the castle like feral dogs , looking under beds , in closets , behind the wine racks , all their senses hungry for a whiff of her . Belari never knew the fluted girl 's hiding places . It was the servants who always found her . Belari simply wandered the halls and let the servants search her out . The servants thought they knew all her hiding places . The fluted girl shifted her body . Her awkward position already strained her fragile skeleton . She stretched as much as the cramped space allowed , then folded herself back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ones Belari kept in cages in the kitchen : small and soft with wet warm eyes , they could sit and wait for hours . The fluted girl summoned patience and ignored the sore protest of her folded body . Soon she had to show herself , or Madame Belari would get impatient and send for Burson , her head of security . Then Burson would bring his jackals and they would hunt again , crisscrossing every room , spraying pheromone additives across the floors and following her neon tracks to her hidey-hole . She had to leave before Burson came . Madame Belari punished her if the staff wasted time scrubbing out pheromones . The fluted girl shifted her position again . Her legs were beginning to ache . She wondered if they could snap from the strain . Sometimes she was surprised at what broke her . A gentle bump against a table and she was shattered again , with Belari angry at the careless treatment of her investment . The fluted girl sighed .

He had secrets bigger than anyone had guessed . The fluted girl turned his tiny vial in her hands , feeling its smooth glass shape , knowing the amber drops it held within . Already , she missed him . Beyond her hidey-hole , footsteps echoed . Metal scraped heavily across stone . The fluted girl peered out through a crack in her makeshift fortress . Below her , the castle 's pantry lay jumbled with dry goods . Mirriam was looking for her again , poking behind the refrigerated crates of champagne for Belari 's party tonight . They hissed and leaked mist as Mirriam struggled to shove them aside and look deeper into the dark recesses behind . The fluted girl had known Mirriam when they were both children in the town . Now , they were as different as life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hips widening , her rosy face smiling and laughing at her fortune . When they both came to Belari , the fluted girl and Mirriam had been the same height . Now , Mirriam was a grown woman , a full two feet taller than the fluted girl , and filled out to please a man . And she was loyal . She was a good servant for Belari . Smiling , happy to serve . They 'd all been that way when they came up from the town to the castle : Mirriam , the fluted girl , and her sister Nia . Then Belari decided to make them into fluted girls . Mirriam got to grow , but the fluted girls were going to be stars . Mirriam spied a stack of cheeses and hams piled carelessly in one corner . She stalked it while the fluted girl watched and smiled at the plump girl 's suspicions . Mirriam hefted a great wheel of Danish cheese and peered into the gap behind . " Lidia ? Are you there ? " The fluted girl shook her head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A year ago , I would have been . I could have moved the cheeses , with effort . The champagne would have been too much , though . I would never have been behind the champagne . Mirriam stood up . Sweat sheened her face from the effort of moving the bulky goods that fed Belari 's household . Her face looked like a bright shiny apple . She wiped her brow with a sleeve . " Lidia , Madame Belari is getting angry . You 're being a selfish girl . Nia is already waiting for you in the practice room . " Lidia nodded silently . Yes , Nia would be in the practice room . She was the good sister . Lidia was the bad one . The one they had to search for . Lidia was the reason both fluted girls were punished . Belari had given up on discipline for Lidia directly . She contented herself with punishing both sisters and letting guilt enforce compliance . Sometimes it worked . But not now . Not with Stephen gone . Lidia needed quiet now . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her secret place which she showed to Stephen and which he had examined with such surprised sad eyes . Stephen 's eyes had been brown . When he looked at her , she thought that his eyes were almost as soft as Belari 's rabbits . They were safe eyes . You could fall into those safe brown eyes and never worry about breaking a bone . Mirriam sat heavily on a sack of potatoes and scowled around her , acting for her potential audience . " You 're being a selfish girl . A vicious selfish girl to make us all search this way . " The fluted girl nodded . Yes , I am a selfish girl , she thought . I am a selfish girl , and you are a woman , and yet we are the same age , and I am smarter than you . You are clever but you do n't know that hidey-holes are best when they are in places no one looks . You look for me under and behind and between , but you do n't look up . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Stephen watched us all . Mirriam grimaced and got up . " No matter . Burson will find you . " She brushed the dust from her skirts . " You hear me ? Burson will find you . " She left the pantry . Lidia waited for Mirriam to go away . It galled her that Mirriam was right . Burson would find her . He found her every time , if she waited too long . Silent time could only be stolen for so many minutes . It lasted as long as it took Belari to lose patience and call the jackals . Then another hidey-hole was lost . Lidia turned Stephen 's tiny blown-glass bottle in her delicate fingers a final time . A parting gift , she understood , now that he was gone , now that he would no longer comfort her when Belari 's depredations became too much . She forced back tears . No more time to cry . Burson would be looking for her . She pressed the vial into a secure crack , tight against the stone and roughhewn wood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jar of red lentils back until she had an opening . She squeezed out from behind the legume wall that lined the pantry 's top shelves . It had taken weeks for her to clear out the back jars and make a place for herself , but the jars made a good hidey-hole . A place others neglected to search . She had a fortress of jars , full of flat innocent beans , and behind that barrier , if she was patient and bore the strain , she could crouch for hours . She climbed down . Carefully , carefully , she thought . We do n't want to break a bone . We have to be careful of the bones . She hung from the shelves as she gently worked the fat jar of red lentils back into place then slipped down the last shelves to the pantry floor . Barefoot on cold stone flagging , Lidia studied her hidey-hole . Yes , it looked good still . Stephen 's final gift was safe up there . No one looked able to fit in that few feet of space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would suspect she folded herself so perfectly into such a place . She was slight as a mouse , and sometimes fit into surprising places . For that , she could thank Belari . She turned and hurried from the pantry , determined to let the servants catch her far away from her last surviving hidey-hole . BY THE TIME LIDIA reached the dining hall , she believed she might gain the practice rooms without discovery . There might be no punishments . Belari was kind to those she loved , but uncompromising when they disappointed her . Though Lidia was too delicate to strike , there were other punishments . Lidia thought of Stephen . A small part of her was happy that he was beyond Belari 's tortures . Lidia slipped along the dining hall 's edge , shielded by ferns and blooming orchids . Between the lush leaves and flowers , she caught glimpses of the dining table 's long ebony expanse , polished mirror-bright each day by the servants and perpetually set with gleaming silver . She studied the room for observers . It was empty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , despite the winter season that slashed the mountains around the castle . When she and Nia had been younger , before their surgeries , they had run in the mountains , amongst the pines . Lidia slipped through the orchids : one from Singapore ; another from Chennai ; another , striped like a tiger , engineered by Belari . She touched the delicate tiger blossom , admiring its lurid color . We are beautiful prisoners , she thought . Just like you . The ferns shuddered . A man exploded from the greenery , springing on her like a wolf . His hands wrenched her shoulders . His fingers plunged into her pale flesh and Lidia gasped as they stabbed her nerves into paralysis . She collapsed to the slate flagstones , a butterfly folding as Burson pressed her down . She whimpered against the stone , her heart hammering inside her chest at the shock of Burson 's ambush . She moaned , trembling under his weight , her face hard against the castle 's smooth gray slate . On the stone beside her , a pink and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he was sure of her compliance , Burson allowed her to move . His great weight lessened , lifting away from her like a tank rolling off a crushed hovel . Lidia forced herself to sit up . Finally she stood , an unsteady pale fairy dwarfed by the looming monster that was Belari 's head of security . Burson 's mountainous body was a cragged landscape of muscle and scars , all juts of strength and angry puckered furrows of combat . Mirriam gossiped that he had previously been a gladiator , but she was romantic and Lidia suspected his scars came from training handlers , much as her own punishments came from Belari . Burson held her wrist , penning it in a rock-like grasp . For all its unyielding strength , his grip was gentle . After an initial disastrous breakage , he had learned what strain her skeleton could bear before it shattered . Lidia struggled , testing his hold on her wrist , then accepted her capture . Burson knelt , bringing his height to match hers . Red-rimed eyes studied her . Augmented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Burson 's slashed face slowly lost the green blush of camouflage , abandoning stone and foliage colors now that he stood in open air . Where his hand touched her though , his skin paled , as though powdered by flour , matching the white of her own flesh . " Where have you been hiding ? " he rumbled . " Nowhere . " Burson 's red eyes narrowed , his brows furrowing over deep pits of interrogation . He sniffed at her clothing , hunting for clues . He brought his nose close to her face , her hair , snuffled at her hands . " The kitchens , " he murmured . Lidia flinched . His red eyes studied her closely , hunting for more details , watching the unintentional reactions of her skin , the blush of discovery she could not hide from his prying eyes . Burson smiled . He hunted with the wild fierce joy of his bloodhound genetics . It was difficult to tell where the jackal , dog , and human blended in the man . His joys were hunting , capture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a steel bracelet from a pouch . " I have something for you , Lidia . " He slapped the jewelry onto Lidia 's wrist . It writhed around her thin arm , snakelike , chiming as it locked . " No more hiding for you . " A current charged up Lidia 's arm and she cried out , shivering as electricity rooted through her body . Burson supported her as the current cut off . He said , " I 'm tired of searching for Belari 's property . " He smiled , tight-lipped , and pushed her toward the practice rooms . Lidia allowed herself to be herded . Belari was in the performance hall when Burson brought Lidia before her . Servants bustled around her , arranging tables , setting up the round stage , installing the lighting . The walls were hung in pale muslin shot through with electric charges , a billowing sheath of charged air that crackled and sparked whenever a servant walked near . Belari seemed unaware of the fanciful world building around her as she tossed orders at her events coordinator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in deference to the warmth of human activity . She spared Burson and Lidia a quick glance , then turned her attention back to her servant , still furiously scribbling on a digital pad . " I want everything to be perfect tonight , Tania . Nothing out of place . Nothing amiss . Perfect . " " Yes , Madame . " Belari smiled . Her face was mathematically sculpted into beauty , structured by focus-groups and cosmetic traditions that stretched back generations . Cocktails of disease prophylaxis , cell-scouring cancer inhibitors , and Revitia kept Belari 's physical appearance at twenty-eight , much as Lidia 's own Revitia treatments kept her frozen in the first throes of adolescence . " And I want Vernon taken care of . " " Will he want a companion ? " Belari shook her head . " No . He 'll confine himself to harassing me , I 'm sure . " She shivered . " Disgusting man . " Tania tittered . Belari 's chill gaze quieted her . Belari surveyed the performance hall . " I want everything in here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want them packed together so that they feel each other when the girls perform . I want it very tight . Very intimate . " Tania nodded and scribbled more notes on her pad . She tapped the screen authoritatively , sending orders to the staff . Already , servants would be receiving messages in their earbuds , reacting to their mistress 's demands . Belari said , " I want Tingle available . With the champagne . It will whet their appetites . " " You 'll have an orgy if you do . " Belari laughed . " That 's fine . I want them to remember tonight . I want them to remember our fluted girls . Vernon particularly . " Her laughter quieted , replaced by a hard-edged smile , brittle with emotion . " He 'll be angry when he finds out about them . But he 'll want them , anyway . And he 'll bid like the rest . " Lidia watched Belari 's face . She wondered if the woman knew how clearly she broadcast her feelings about the Pendant Entertainment executive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She and Stephen had watched Vernon Weir touch Belari , and watched Belari first shy from his touch and then give in , summoning the reserves of her acting skill to play the part of a seduced woman . Vernon Weir had made Belari famous . He 'd paid the expense of her body sculpting and made her a star , much as Belari now invested in Lidia and her sister . But Master Weir extracted a price for his aid , Faustian devil that he was . Stephen and Lidia had watched as Weir took his pleasure from Belari , and Stephen had whispered to her that when Weir was gone , Belari would summon Stephen and reenact the scene , but with Stephen as the victim , and then he would pretend , as she did , that he was happy to submit . Lidia 's thoughts broke off . Belari had turned to her . The angry welt from Stephen 's attack was still visible on her throat , despite the cell-knitters she popped like candy . Lidia thought it must gall her to have a scar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Belari seemed to catch the focus of Lidia 's gaze . Her lips pursed and she pulled the collar of her body armor close , hiding the damage . Her green eyes narrowed . " We 've been looking for you . " Lidia ducked her head . " I 'm sorry , Mistress . " Belari ran a finger under the fluted girl 's jaw , lifting her downcast face until they were eye to eye . " I should punish you for wasting my time . " " Yes , Mistress . I 'm sorry . " The fluted girl lowered her eyes . Belari would n't hit her . She was too expensive to fix . She wondered if Belari would use electricity , or isolation , or some other humiliation cleverly devised . Instead , Belari pointed to the steel bracelet . " What 's this ? " Burson did n't flinch at her question . He had no fear . He was the only servant who had no fear . Lidia admired him for that , if nothing else . " To track her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . " It causes no physical destruction . " Belari shook her head . " I need her without jewelry tonight . Take it off . " " She will hide . " " No . She wants to be star . She 'll be good now , wo n't you , Lidia ? " Lidia nodded . Burson shrugged and removed the bracelet , unperturbed . He leaned his great scarred face close to Lidia 's ear . " Do n't hide in the kitchens the next time . I will find you . " He stood away , smiling his satisfaction . Lidia narrowed her eyes at Burson and told herself she had won a victory that Burson did n't know her hidey-hole yet . But then Burson smiled at her and she wondered if he did know already , if he was playing with her the way a cat played with a maimed mouse . Belari said , " Thank you , Burson , " then paused , eyeing the great creature who looked so man-like yet moved with the feral quickness of the wilds . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Your fief is safe . We are checking the rest of the staff , for background irregularities . " " Have you found anything ? " Burson shook his head . " Your staff love you . " Belari 's voice sharpened . " That 's what we thought about Stephen . And now I wear body armor in my own fief . I ca n't afford the appearance of lost popularity . It affects my share price too much . " " I 've been thorough . " " If my stock falls , Vernon will have me wired for TouchSense . I wo n't have it . " " I understand . There will be no more failures . " Belari frowned at the monster looming over her . " Good . Well , come on then . " She motioned for Lidia to join her . " Your sister has been waiting for you . " She took the fluted girl by the hand and led her out of the performance hall . Lidia spared a glance back . Burson was gone . The servants bustled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either blended into the walls or sped away on his errands of security . Belari tugged Lidia 's hand . " You led us on a merry search . I thought we would have to spray the pheromones again . " " I 'm sorry . " " No harm . This time . " Belari smiled down at her . " Are you nervous about tonight ? " Lidia shook her head . " No . " " No ? " Lidia shrugged . " Will Master Weir purchase our stock ? " " If he pays enough . " " Will he ? " Belari smiled . " I think he will , yes . You are unique . Like me . Vernon likes to collect rare beauty . " " What is he like ? " Belari 's smile stiffened . She looked up , concentrating on their path through the castle . " When I was a girl , very young , much younger than you , long before I became famous , I used to go to a playground . A man came to watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend . I did n't like him , but being near him made me dizzy . Whatever he said made perfect sense . He smelled bad , but I could n't pull away from him . " Belari shook her head . " Someone 's mother chased him away . " She looked down at Lidia . " He had a chemical cologne , you understand ? " " Contraband ? " " Yes . From Asia . Not legal here . Vernon is like that . Your skin crawls but he draws you to him . " " He touches you . " Belari looked down at Lidia sadly . " He likes my old crone experience in my young girl body . But he hardly discriminates . He touches everyone . " She smiled slightly . " But not you , perhaps . You are too valuable to touch . " " Too delicate . " " Do n't sound so bitter . You 're unique . We 're going to make you a star . " Belari looked down at her prot&eacute;g&eacute; hungrily . " Your stock will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LIDIA WATCHED from her windows as Belari 's guests began to arrive . Aircars snaked in under security escort , sliding low over the pines , green and red running lights blinking in the darkness . Nia came to stand behind Lidia . " They 're here . " " Yes . " Snow clotted thickly on the trees , like heavy cream . The occasional blue sweeps of search beams highlighted the snow and the dark silhouettes of the forest ; Burson 's ski patrols , hoping to spy out the telltale red exhalations of intruders crouched amongst pine shadows . Their beams swept over the ancient hulk of a ski lift that climbed up from the town . It was rusting , silent except when the wind caught its chairs and sent its cables swaying . The empty seats swung lethargically in the freezing air , another victim of Belari 's influence . Belari hated competition . Now , she was the only patron of the town that sparkled in the deep of the valley far below . " You should get dressed , " Nia said . Lidia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched her from between elfin lids . Her skin was pale , stripped of pigment , and she was thin , accenting the delicacy of her bone structure . That was one true thing about her , about both of them : their bones were theirs . It was what had attracted Belari to them in the first place , when they were just eleven . just old enough for Belari to strip them from their parents . Lidia 's gaze returned to the view . Deep in the tight crease of the mountain valley , the town shimmered with amber lights . " Do you miss it ? " she asked . Nia slipped closer . " Miss what ? " Lidia nodded down at the shimmering jewel . " The town . " Their parents had been glassblowers , practicing the old arts abandoned in the face of efficient manufacturing , breathing delicate works into existence , sand running liquid under their supervision . They had moved to Belari 's fief for patronage , like all the town 's artisans : the potters , the blacksmiths , the painters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence grew . Niels Kinkaid had made his fortune from Belari 's favor , turning iron to her will , outfitting her fortress with its great hand-wrought gates and her gardens with crouching sculptural surprises : foxes and children peering from amongst lupine and monkshood in the summers and deep drifted snow in the winters . Now he was almost famous enough to float his own stock . Lidia 's parents had come for patronage , but Belari 's evaluating eye had not fallen on their artistry . Instead , she selected the biological accident of their twin daughters : delicate and blond with cornflower eyes that watched the world blinkless as they absorbed the fief 's mountain wonders . Their trade flourished now thanks to the donation of their children . Nia jostled Lidia gently , her ghostly face serious . " Hurry and dress . You must n't be late . " Lidia turned away from her black-eyed sister . Of their original features , little remained . Belari had watched them grow in the castle for two years and then the pills began . Revitia treatments at thirteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come the eyes , drawn from twins in some far foreign land . Lidia sometimes wondered if in India , two dusky girl children looked out at the world from cornflower eyes , or if they walked the mud streets of their village guided only by the sound of echoes on cow-dung walls and the scrape of their canes on the dirt before them . Lidia studied the night beyond the windows with her stolen black eyes . More aircars dropped guests on the landing pads then spread gossamer wings and let the mountain winds bear them away . More treatments had followed : pigment drugs drained color from their skins , leaving them Kabuki pale , ethereal shadows of their former mountain sun-blushed selves , and then the surgeries began . She remembered waking after each successive surgery , crippled , unable to move for weeks despite the wide-bore needles full of cell-knitters and nutrient fluids the doctor flushed through her slight body . The doctor would hold her hand after the surgeries , wipe the sweat from her pale brow and whisper , " Poor girl . Poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the progress and say that Lidia and Nia would soon be stars . Gusts of wind tore snow from the pines and sent it swirling in great tornado clouds around the arriving aristocracy . The guests hurried through the driving snow while the blue search beams of Burson 's ski patrols carved across the forests . Lidia sighed and turned from the windows , obedient finally to Nia 's anxious hope that she would dress . Stephen and Lidia went on picnics together when Belari was away from the fief . They would leave the great gray construct of Belari 's castle and walk carefully across the mountain meadows , Stephen always helping her , guiding her fragile steps through fields of daisies , columbine , and lupine until they peered down over sheer granite cliffs to the town far below . All about them glacier-sculpted peaks ringed the valley like giants squatting in council , their faces adorned with snow even in summer , like beards of wisdom . At the edge of the precipice , they ate a picnic lunch and Stephen told stories of the world before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the country had been democratic . That people once voted for their lieges . That they had been free to travel between any fief they liked . Everyone , he said , not just stars . Lidia knew there were places on the coasts where this occurred . She had heard of them . But it seemed difficult to credit . She was a child of a fief . " It 's true , " Stephen said . " On the coasts , the people choose their own leader . It 's only here , in the mountains , that it 's different . " He grinned at her . His soft brown eyes crinkled slightly , showing his humor , showing that he already saw the skepticism on her face . Lidia laughed . " But who would pay for everything ? Without Belari who would pay to fix the roads and make the schools ? " She picked an aster and twirled it between her fingers , watching the purple spokes blur around the yellow center of the flower . " The people do . " Lidia laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They hardly have enough to feed themselves . And how would they know what to do ? Without Belari , no one would even know what needs fixing , or improving . " She tossed the flower away , aiming to send it over the cliff . Instead , the wind caught it , and it fell near her . Stephen picked up the flower and flicked it over the edge easily . " It 's true . They do n't have to be rich , they just work together . You think Belari knows everything ? She hires advisors . People can do that as well as she . " Lidia shook her head . " People like Mirriam ? Ruling a fief ? It sounds like madness . No one would respect her . " Stephen scowled . " It 's true , " he said stubbornly , and because Lidia liked him and did n't want him to be unhappy , she agreed that it might be true , but in her heart , she thought that Stephen was a dreamer . It made him sweet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . " Do you like Belari ? " Stephen asked suddenly . " What do you mean ? " " Do you like her ? " Lidia gave him a puzzled look . Stephen 's brown eyes studied her intensely . She shrugged . " She 's a good liege . Everyone is fed and cared for . It 's not like Master Weir 's fief . " Stephen made a face of disgust . " Nothing is like Weir 's fief . He 's barbaric . He put one of his servants on a spit . " He paused . " But still , look at what Belari has done to you . " Lidia frowned . " What about me ? " " You 're not natural . Look at your eyes , your skin and ... , " he turned his eyes away , his voice lowering , " your bones . Look what she did to your bones . " " What 's wrong with my bones ?

They seemed alone , but people were always around : security on the hillsides , others out for walks . Burson might be there , blended with the scenery , a stony man hidden amongst the rocks . Stephen had a hard time understanding about Burson . " I can walk , " she whispered fiercely . " How many times have you broken a leg or an arm or a rib ? " " Not in a year . " She was proud of it . She had learned to be careful . Stephen laughed incredulously . " Do you know how many bones I 've broken in my life ? " He did n't wait for an answer . " None . Not a single bone . Never . Do you even remember what it 's like to walk without worrying that you 'll trip , or bump into someone ? You 're like glass . " Lidia shook her head and looked away . " I 'm going to be star . Belari will float us on the markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stephen said . His eyes had a pitying quality that made Lidia angry . " I can too . And it 's enough . " " But - " " No ! " Lidia shook her head . " Who are you to say what I do ? Look what Belari does to you , but still you are loyal ! I may have had surgeries , but at least I 'm not her toy . " It was the only time Stephen became angry . For a moment the rage in his face made Lidia think he would strike her and break her bones . A part of her hoped he would , that he would release the terrible frustration brewing between them , two servants each calling the other slave . Instead , Stephen mastered himself and gave up the argument . He apologized and held her hand and they were quiet as the Sun set , but it was already too late and their quiet time was mined . Lidia 's mind had gone back to the days before the surgeries , when she ran without care , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it felt as though he had ripped away a scab and revealed an aching bitter wound . The performance hall trembled with anticipation , a room full of people high on Tingle and champagne . The muslin on the walls flickered like lightning as Belari 's guests , swathed in brilliant silks and sparkling gold , swirled through the room in colorful clouds of revelry , clumping together with conversation , then breaking apart with laughter as they made their social rounds . Lidia slipped carefully amongst the guests , her pale skin and diaphanous shift a spot of simplicity amongst the gaudy colors and wealth . Some of the guests eyed her curiously , the strange girl threading through their pleasure . They quickly dismissed her . She was merely another creature of Belari 's , intriguing to look at , perhaps , but of no account . Their attention always returned to the more important patterns of gossip and association swirling around them . Lidia smiled . Soon , she thought , you will recognize me . She slipped up against a wall , near a table piled high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of plump strawberries . Lidia scanned the crowds . Her sister was there , across the room , dressed in an identical diaphanous shift . Belari stood surrounded by mediascape names and fief lieges , her green gown matching her eyes , smiling , apparently at ease , even without her newfound habit of body armor . Vernon Weir slipped up behind Belari , stroking her shoulder . Lidia saw Belari shiver and steel herself against Weir 's touch . She wondered how he could not notice . Perhaps he was one of those who took pleasure in the repulsion he inflicted . Belari smiled at him , her emotions under control once again . Lidia took a small plate of meats from the table . The meat was drizzled with raspberry reduction and was sweet . Belari liked sweet things , like the strawberries she was eating now " with the Pendant Entertainment executive at the far end of the table . The sweet addiction was another side effect of the Tingle . Belari caught sight of Lidia and led Vernon Weir toward her . " Do you like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded , finishing carefully . Belari 's smile sharpened . " I 'm not surprised . You have a taste for good ingredients . " Her face was flushed with Tingle . Lidia was glad they were in public . When Belari took too much Tingle she hungered and became erratic . Once , Belari had crushed strawberries against her skin , making her pale flesh blush with the juice , and then , high with the erotic charge of overdose , she had forced Lidia 's tongue to Nia 's juice-stained flesh and Nia 's tongue to hers , while Belari watched , pleased with the decadent performance . Belari selected a strawberry and offered it to Lidia . " Here . Have one , but do n't stain yourself . I want you perfect . " Her eyes glistened with excitement . Lidia steeled herself against memory and accepted the berry . Vernon studied Lidia . " She 's yours ? " Belari smiled fondly . " One of my fluted girls .

" Belari smiled . " We both know nothing that beautiful comes artificially . " She reached down and stroked Lidia 's pale blond hair , smiling with satisfaction at her creation . " When I got her , she had the most beautiful blue eyes . The color of the flowers you find here in the mountains in the summer . " She shook her head . " I had them replaced . They were beautiful , but not the look I wished for . " Vernon stood up again . " She is striking . But not as beautiful as you . " Belari smiled cynically at Vernon . " Is that why you want me wired for TouchSense ? " Vernon shrugged . " It 's a new market , Belari . With your response , you could be a star . " " I 'm already a star . " Vernon smiled . " But Revitia is expensive . " " We always come back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave her a hard look . " I do n't want to be at odds with you , Belari . You 've been wonderful for us .

You could have bought your stock a long time ago if you were n't so attached to immortality . " He eyed Belari coldly . " If you want to be immortal , you will wire TouchSense . Already we 're seeing massive acceptance in the marketplace . It 's the future of entertainment . " " I 'm an actress , not a marionette . I do n't crave people inside my skin . " Vernon shrugged . " We all pay a price for our celebrity . Where the markets move , we must follow . None of us is truly free . " He looked at Belari meaningfully . " Certainly not if we want to live forever . " Belari smiled slyly . " Perhaps . " She nodded at Lidia . " Run along . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There 's something I 'd like you to see . " STEPHEN GAVE HER the vial the day before he died . Lidia had asked what it was , a few amber drops in a vial no larger than her pinky . She had smiled at the gift , feeling playful , but Stephen had been serious . " It 's freedom , " he said . She shook her head , uncomprehending . " If you ever choose , you control your life . You do n't have to be Belari 's pet . " " I 'm not her pet . " He shook his head . " If you ever want escape , " he held up the vial , " it 's here . " He handed it to her and closed her pale hand around the tiny bottle . It was handblown . Briefly , she wondered if it came from her parents " workshop . Stephen said , " We 're small people here . Only people like Belari have control . In other places , other parts of the world , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he smiled sadly , " all we have is our lives . " Comprehension dawned . She tried to pull away but Stephen held her firmly . " I 'm not saying you want it now , but someday , perhaps you will . Perhaps you 'll decide you do n't want to cooperate with Belari anymore . No matter how many gifts she showers on you . " He squeezed her hand gently . " It 's quick . Almost painless . " He looked into her eyes with the soft brown kindness that had always been there . It was a gift of love , however misguided , and because she knew it would make him happy , she nodded and agreed to keep the vial and put it in her hidey-hole , just in case . She could n't have known that he had already chosen his own death , that he would hunt Belari with a knife , and almost succeed . No one noticed when the fluted girls took their places on the center dais . They were merely oddities , pale angels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat , feeling her pulse threading rapidly under her white , white skin . It throbbed against her tongue as she sought out the tiny bore hole in her sister 's body . She felt the wet touch of Nia 's tongue on her own throat , nestling into her flesh like a small mouse seeking comfort . Lidia stilled herself , waiting for the attention of the people , patient and focused on her performance . She felt Nia breathe , her lungs expanding inside the frail cage of her chest . Lidia took her own breath . They began to play , first her own notes , running out through unstopped keys in her flesh , and then Nia 's notes beginning as well . The open sound , haunting moments of breath , pressed through their bodies . The melancholy tones trailed off . Lidia moved her head , breathing in , mirroring Nia as she pressed her lips again to her sister 's flesh . This time , Lidia kissed her sister 's hand . Nia 's mouth sought the delicate hollow of her clavicle . Music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out from their bodies . Nia breathed into Lidia and the exhalation of her lungs slipped out through Lidia 's bones , tinged with emotion , as though the warm air of her sister came to life within her body . Around the girls , the guests fell quiet . The silence spread , like ripples from a stone thrown into a placid pool , speeding outward from their epicenter to lap at the farthest edges of the room . All eyes turned to the pale girls on stage . Lidia could feel their eyes , hungry , yearning , almost physical as their gazes pressed against her . She moved her hands beneath her sister 's shift , clasping her close . Her sister 's hands touched her hips , closing stops in her fluted body . At their new embrace a sigh of yearning came from the crowd , a whisper of their own hungers made musical . Lidia 's hands found the keys to her sister , her tongue touching Nia 's throat once more . Her fingers ran along the knuckles of Nia 's spine , finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warm breath of herself into her sister and she felt Nia breathing into her . Nia 's sound was dark and melancholy , her own tones , brighter , higher , ran in counterpoint , a slowly developing story of forbidden touch . They stood embraced . Their body music built , notes intertwining seductively as their hands stroked one another 's bodies , bringing forth a complex rising tide of sound . Suddenly , Nia wrenched at Lidia 's shift and Lidia 's fingers tore away Nia 's own . They stood revealed , pale elfin creatures of music . The guests around them gasped as the notes poured out brighter now , unmuffled by clinging clothes . The girls " musical graftings shone : cobalt boreholes in their spines , glinting stops and keys made of brass and ivory that ran along their fluted frames and contained a hundred possible instruments within the structure of their bodies . Nia 's mouth crept up Lidia 's arm . Notes spilled out of Lidia as bright as water jewels . Laments of desire and sin flowed from Nia 's pores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lust . The spectators pressed closer , incited by the spectacle of naked youth and music intertwined . Around her , Lidia was vaguely aware of their watching eyes and flushed expressions . The Tingle and the performance were doing their work on the guests . She could feel the heat rising in the room . She and Nia sank slowly to the floor , their embraces becoming more erotic and elaborate , the sexual tension of their musical conflict increasing as they entwined . Years of training had come to this moment , this carefully constructed weave of harmonizing flesh . We perform pornography , Lidia thought . Pornography for the profit of Belari . She caught a glimpse of her patron 's gleaming pleasure , Vernon Weir dumbstruck beside her . Yes , she thought , look at us , Master Weir , look and see what pornography we perform , and then it was her turn to play upon her sister , and her tongue and hands stroked Nia 's keys . It was a dance of seduction and acquiescence . They had other dances , solos and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their debut , Belari had chosen this one . The energy of their music increased , violent , climactic , until at last she and Nia lay upon the floor , expended , sheathed in sweat , bare twins tangled in musical lasciviousness . Their body music fell silent . Around them , no one moved . Lidia tasted salt on her sister 's skin as they held their pose . The lights dimmed , signaling completion . Applause exploded around them . The lights brightened . Nia drew herself upright . Her lips quirked in a smile of satisfaction as she helped Lidia to her feet . You see ? Nia 's eyes seemed to say . We will be stars . Lidia found herself smiling with her sister . Despite the loss of Stephen , despite Belari 's depredations , she was smiling . The audience 's adoration washed over her , a balm of pleasure . They curtsied to Belari as they had been trained , making obeisance first to their patron , the mother goddess who had created them . Belari smiled at the gesture , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests . The people 's applause increased again at the girls " good grace , then Nia and Lidia were curtseying to the corners of the compass , gathering their shifts and leaving the stage , guided by Burson 's hulking presence to their patron . The applause continued as they crossed the distance to Belari . Finally , at Belari 's wave , the clapping gave way to respectful silence . She smiled at her assembled guests , placing her arms around the slight shoulders of the girls and said , " My lords and ladies , our Fluted Girls , " and applause burst over them again , one final explosion of adulation before the guests fell to talking , fanning themselves , and feeling the flush of their own skins which the girls had inspired . Belari held the fluted girls closely and whispered in their ears , " You did well . " She hugged them carefully . Vernon Weir 's eyes roved over Lidia and Nia 's exposed bodies . " You outdo yourself , Belari , " he said . Belari inclined her head slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became proprietary . Belari 's voice did n't betray her tension . She kept it light , comfortably satisfied with her position , but her fingers dug into Lidia 's skin . " They are my finest . " " Such an extraordinary Grafting . " " It 's expensive when they break a bone . They 're terribly fragile . " Belari smiled down at the girls affectionately . " They hardly remember what it 's like to walk without care . " " All the most beautiful things are fragile . " Vernon touched Lidia 's cheek . She forced herself not to flinch . " It must have been complex to build them . " Belari nodded . " They are intricate . " She traced a finger along the boreholes in Nia 's arm . " Each note is n't simply affected by the placement of fingers on keys ; but also by how they press against one another , or the floor ; if an arm is bent or if it is straightened . We froze their hormone levels so that they would n't grow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an enormous amount of skill for them to play and to dance . " " How long have you been training them ? " " Five years . Seven if you count the surgeries that began the process . " Vernon shook his head . " And we never heard of them . " " You would have ruined them . I 'm going to make them stars . " " We made you a star . " " And you 'll unmake me as well , if I falter . " " So you 'll float them on the markets ? " Belari smiled at him . " Of course . I 'll retain a controlling interest , but the rest , I will sell . " " You 'll be rich . " Belari smiled , " More than that , I 'll be independent . " Vernon mimed elaborate disappointment . " I suppose this means we wo n't be wiring you for TouchSense . " " I suppose not . " The tension between them was palpable . Vernon , calculating , looking for an opening while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes narrowed . As though sensing his thoughts , Belari said , " I 've insured them . " Vernon shook his head ruefully . " Belari , you do me a disservice . " He sighed . " I suppose I should congratulate you . To have such loyal subjects , and such wealth , you 've achieved more than I would have thought possible when we first met . " " My servants are loyal because I treat them well . They are happy to serve . " " Would your Stephen agree ? " Vernon waved at the sweetmeats in the center of the refreshment table , drizzled with raspberry and garnished with bright green leaves of mint . Belari smiled . " Oh yes , even him . Do you know that just as Michael and Renee were preparing to cook him , he looked at me and said " Thank you ' ? " She shrugged . " He tried to kill me , but he did have the most eager urge to please , even so . At the very end , he told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life had been in service to me . " She wiped at a theatrical tear . " I do n't know how it is , that he could love me so , and still so desire to have me dead . " She looked away from Vernon , watching the other guests . " For that , though , I thought I would serve him , rather than simply stake him out as a warning . We loved each other , even if he was a traitor . " Vernon shrugged sympathetically . " So many people dislike the fief structure . You try to tell them that you provide far more security than what existed before , and yet still they protest , and , " he glanced meaningfully at Belari , " sometimes more . " Belari shrugged . " Well , my subjects do n't protest . At least not until Stephen . They love me . " Vernon smiled . " As we all do . In any case , serving him chilled this way . " he lifted a plate from the table . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she followed the conversation . She looked at the array of finely sliced meats and then at Vernon as he forked a bite into his mouth . Her stomach turned . Only her training let her remain still . Vernon and Belari 's conversation continued , but all Lidia could think was that she had consumed her friend , the one who had been kind to her . Anger trickled through her , filling her porous body with rebellion . She longed to attack her smug patron , but her rage was impotent . She was too weak to hurt Belari . Her bones were too fragile , her physique too delicate . Belari was strong in all things as she was weak . Lidia stood trembling with frustration , and then Stephen 's voice whispered comforting wisdom inside her head . She could defeat Belari . Her pale skin flushed with pleasure at the thought . As though sensing her , Belari looked down . " Lidia , go put on clothes and come back . I 'll want to introduce you and your sister to everyone before we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The vial was still there , if Burson had not found it . Her heart hammered at the thought : that the vial might be missing , that Stephen 's final gift had been destroyed by the monster . She slipped through dimly lit servant 's tunnels to the kitchen , anxiety pulsing at every step . The kitchen was busy , full of staff preparing new platters for the guests . Lidia 's stomach turned . She wondered if more trays bore Stephen 's remains . The stoves flared and the ovens roared as Lidia slipped through the confusion , a ghostly waif sliding along the walls . No one paid her attention . They were too busy laboring for Belari , doing her bidding without thought or conscience : slaves , truly . Obedience was all Belari cared for . Lidia smiled grimly to herself . If obedience was what Belari loved , she was happy to provide a true betrayal . She would collapse on the floor , amongst her mistress 's guests , destroying Belari 's perfect moment , shaming her and foiling her hopes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its archway . Everyone was busy serving , running like dogs to feed Belari 's brood . Lidia wandered amongst the stores , past casks ofoil and sacks of onions , past the great humming freezers that held whole sides of beef within their steel bowels . She reached the broad tall shelves at the pantry 's end and climbed past preserved peaches , tomatoes , and olives to the high-stored legumes . She pushed aside a vacuum jar of lentils and felt within . For a moment , as she slid her hand around the cramped hiding place , she thought the vial was missing , but then her grasp closed on the tiny blown-glass bulb . She climbed down , careful not to break any bones , laughing at herself as she did , thinking that it hardly mattered now , and hurried back through the kitchen , past the busy , obedient servants , and then down the servants " tunnels , intent on self-destruction . As she sped through the darkened tunnels , she smiled , glad that she would never again steal through dim halls hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . For the first time in years she controlled her own fate . Burson lunged from the shadows , his skin shifting from black to flesh as he materialized . He seized her and jerked her to a halt . Lidia 's body strained at the abrupt capture . She gasped , her joints creaking . Burson gathered her wrists into a single massive fist . With his other hand , he turned her chin upward , subjecting her black eyes to the interrogation of his red-rimmed orbs . " Where are you going ? " His size could make you mistake him for stupid , she thought . His slow rumbling voice . His great animal-like gaze . But he was observant where Belari was not . Lidia trembled and cursed herself for foolishness . Burson studied her , his nostrils flaring at the scent of fear . His eyes watched the blush of her skin . " Where are you going ? " he asked again . Warning laced his tone . " Back to the party , " Lidia whispered . " Where have you been ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Nia is already there . You are late . Belari wondered about you . " Lidia said nothing . There was nothing she could say to make Burson lose his suspicions . She was terrified that he would pry open her clenched hands and discover the glass vial . The servants said it was impossible to lie to Burson . He discovered everything . Burson eyed her silently , letting her betray herself . Finally he said , " You went to your hidey-hole . " He sniffed at her . " Not in the kitchen , though . The pantry . " He smiled , revealing hard sharp teeth . " High up . " Lidia held her breath . Burson could n't let go of a problem until it was solved . It was bred into him . His eyes swept over her skin . " You 're nervous . " He sniffed . " Sweating . Fear . " Lidia shook her head stubbornly . The tiny vial in her hands was slick , she was afraid she would drop it , or move her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength pulled her until they were nose to nose . His fist squeezed her wrists until she thought they would shatter . He studied her eyes . " So afraid . " " No . " Lidia shook her head again . Burson laughed , contempt and pity in the sound . " It must be terrifying to know you can be broken , at any time . " His stone grip relaxed . Blood rushed back into her wrists . " Have your hidey-hole , then . Your secret is safe with me . " For a moment , Lidia was n't sure what he meant . She stood before the giant security officer , frozen still , but then Burson waved his hand irritably and slipped back into the shadows , his skin darkening as he disappeared . " Go . " Lidia stumbled away , her legs wavering , threatening to give out . She forced herself to keep moving , imagining Burson 's eyes burning into her pale back . She wondered if he still watched her or if he had already lost interest in the harmless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the closets and made the staff hunt high and low for the selfish mite . Lidia shook her head in wonderment . Burson had not seen . Burson , for all his enhancements , was blind , so accustomed to inspiring terror that he could no longer distinguish fear from guilt . A new gaggle of admirers swarmed around Belari , people who knew she was soon to be independent . Once the fluted girls floated on the market , Belari would be nearly as powerful as Vernon Weir , valuable not only for her own performances , but also for her stable of talent . Lidia moved to join her , the vial of liberation hidden in her fist . Nia stood near Belari , talking to Claire Paranovis from SK Net . Nia nodded graciously at whatever the woman was saying , acting as Belari had trained them : always polite , never ruffled , always happy to talk , nothing to hide , but stories to tell . That was how you handled the media . If you kept them full , they never looked deeper . Nia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lidia felt a pang of regret at what she was about to do , then she was beside Belari , and Belari was smiling and introducing her to the men and women who surrounded her with fanatic affection . Mgumi Story . Kim Song Lee . Maria Blyst . Takashi Ghandi . More and more names , the global fraternity of media elites . Lidia smiled and bowed while Belari fended off their proffered hands of congratulation , protecting her delicate investment . Lidia performed as she had been trained , but in her hand the vial lay sweaty , a small jewel of power and destiny . Stephen had been right . The small only controlled their own termination , sometimes not even that . Lidia watched the guests take slices of Stephen , commenting on his sweetness . Sometimes , not even that . She turned from the crowd of admirers and drew a strawberry from the pyramids of fruit on the refreshment table . She dipped it in cream and rolled it in sugar , tasting the mingled flavors . She selected another strawberry , red and tender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitter freedom earned . With her thumb , she popped the tiny cork out of the vial and sprinkled amber jewels on the lush berry . She wondered if it would hurt , or if it would be quick . It hardly mattered , soon she would be free . She would cry out and fall to the floor and the guests would step back , stunned at Belari 's loss . Belari would be humiliated , and more important , would lose the value of the fluted twins . Vernon Weir 's lecherous hands would hold her once again . Lidia gazed at the tainted strawberry . Sweet , Lidia thought . Death should be sweet . She saw Belari watching her , smiling fondly , no doubt happy to see another as addicted to sweets as she . Lidia smiled inwardly , pleased that Belari would see the moment of her rebellion . She raised the strawberry to her lips . Suddenly a new inspiration whispered in her ear . An inch from death , Lidia paused , then turned and held out the strawberry to her patron . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a creature utterly owned . She bowed her head and proffered the strawberry in the palm of her pale hand , bringing forth all her skill , playing the loyal servant desperately eager to please . She held her breath , no longer aware of the room around her . The guests and conversations all had disappeared . Everything had gone silent . There was only Belari and the strawberry and the frozen moment of delicious possibility . <p>
