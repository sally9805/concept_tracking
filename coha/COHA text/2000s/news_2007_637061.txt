<p> Episcopalians not on ropes as some claim <p> The Episcopal Church is indeed a great and a grand instution . In the March 8 edition of the AJC , I read three letters in which each writer expressed negatives about the Episcopal Church . <p> The most sickening said that the church was dying from within . As a member at the Cathedral of St. Phillip here in Atlanta , with a 6,000 membership , let me assure the letter writers that we are neither dying from within nor are we in bad shape as a congregation about pressing issues . <p> We are continuing to grow our membership , we provide leadership of great respect to our city of Atlanta , and we teach a ton of youths in our fabulous school system . <p> I think the letter writers as well as the general community of Atlanta need to know that the Episcopal Church harbors no more problems than any other mainstream religion . It is high time that we Episcopalians shout about our positives that our church makes in our lives as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let the GOOD be known ! <p> DAVID WALLACE HOLCOMB , Atlanta <p> Punish those who sell out Jekyll <p> Diane Shearer is right on the mark ( " It 's up to Georgians to speak up for Jekyll 's fate , " @issue , March 5 ) . I , for one , plan to vote against and campaign against those politicians who approve more development on Jekyll Island . <p> The lack of responsiveness of the Georgia Legislature relating to citizens ' desires and needs is a horrible affirmation of the corruption and lack of accountability that permeates our society and state . <p> Development and " progress " do n't have to be bad words . It is greed and lack of careful planning that have made them so . One only has to look to past actions on Jekyll for examples . I challenge all of us to have the courage to speak and make our feelings about this issue known . <p> ANNE B. JONES , Jackson <p> Finally the South gets its due <p> Well , kiss my grits . The AJC ventured to publish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South is a wasteland ? You 're ignorant , " @issue , March 4 ) . <p> Robert Guest , a Washington correspondent for The Economist , bravely planned a safari to " The South . " Dubious Northern friends worried about such a wild adventure . But he traveled southward and found something that Southerners ( and displaced Northerners ) already knew : The South is a great place . <p> So be our guest , Mr. Guest , and welcome South , brother . No need to report what is well known hereabouts . The South does NOT have to rise again . It has risen ! <p> CATHERINE BOONE SHEALY , Atlanta <p> Belief systems and bananas : Responses to " Let 's debate beliefs , " Letters , March 5 <p> The original letter : <p> Let 's debate beliefs <p> There are at least two things that I would like to experience before my demise : <p> 1 ) the taste of a tree-ripened banana ; and <p> 2 ) to discuss/debate a person with a high IQ ( above 130 ) who feels that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credible and believable . <p> I have listened for more than 60 years to the dummies both lay and clergy and not a single one has ever made any sense . <p> SAM WILLIAMS , Macon <p> Atheists should n't close minds <p> A letter writer with delusions of grandeur wishes to debate someone " with a high IQ ( above 130 ) " about metaphysics . He complains that all who defend religion are " dummies , " and none of them " make any sense . " <p> This is an inadequate forum to begin such a debate because of the constraints of space . However , I would suggest that Sam Williams ponder just four simple questions : <p> 1 ) How can there be anything ? <p> 2 ) How can there be life ? <p> 3 ) What would compel the development of consciousness ? <p> 4 ) What is the nature of consciousness ? ( Is it just a series of metaphors ? ) <p> There is a saying , " A little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing . " When compared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any knowledge possessed by any human mind , either religious or scientific , is " a little bit . " But I believe both science and religion can provide glimpses of reality , and religion ( when not corrupted ) can offer ethical and moral guidelines for living a rich and productive life . <p> To me , the only person more annoying than an unquestioning " True Believer " is an intellectually lazy atheist . <p> GENE DINI , Canton <p> Smug denial is a risky game <p> I could enthusiastically plead guilty to all of Sam Williams ' letter . I have enjoyed tree-ripened bananas in my yard on an island in the Pacific as a Southern Baptist missionary . I did once take an IQ test in college that permits me into his parameters . He would probably be pleased to know that I got a B in my Aristotelian logic class . <p> If we did debate , my first question for him would be to answer the " what if I 'm wrong " query I was posed in high school . From my perspective , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Further , intellectual humility has taught me in my more than 60 years that it is usually not wise to place my opponent in the position that he places his . <p> Maybe it 's the tree-ripened bananas ! <p> PALMER FLETCHER , Dawsonville <p> Wise believers not hard to find <p> While I can not immediately help Sam Williams with his desire for a tree-ripened banana , I might suggest he look to the Mercer University campus there in Macon for someone with a high IQ for him to discuss/debate religion . <p> Or he may simply pick up a copy of " Mere Christianity . " I feel certain C.S. Lewis can provide an ample argument for Christianity being " something credible and believable . " <p> May God bless you , Mr. Williams , in both quests . <p> C.A. PARRISH , Loganville <p> Chance creation wo n't stand <p> Those who choose to deny the influence of God in the universe mostly subscribe to the unlikely idea that a long and unlikely series of mutations , accidents really , strung together over time has resulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I would invite Sam Williams to invest in a Lincoln Log set , a construction-toy set for those of you too young to remember these time-honored children 's toys of my own youth , and a large cardboard box . <p> Pour the disassembled Lincoln Logs over into the box and spend as many hours each day for as long as you are still convinced that we are here by accident , shaking the box to allow the logs to randomly align themselves . When something resembling a log cabin emerges from this series of random occurences , give me a call and the debate can begin . <p> I believe that even those among us with IQ scores of less than 130 can understand this concept and draw their own conclusions . Fortunately God has chosen to reveal his presence to all men , not only to those with superior intelligence . <p> MELVIN EDWARDS , Crawfordville Photo : LOUIE FAVORITE / StaffA cabin made of Lincoln Logs
