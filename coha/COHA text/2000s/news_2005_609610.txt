<p> Magbie Experiences Respiratory Distress at Correctional Treatment Facility September 24 . <p> District Fire and Emergency Medical Services paramedics arrived at approximately 9 a.m . During an interview , one stated that they found Magbie ' unconscious , very sweaty , and sitting at a 45-degree angle in his wheelchair . ' His diaper was saturated with ' very dark ' urine and his catheter drainage bag was filled with ' tea-colored urine . ' One of the paramedics stated . . . that it appeared that ' Magbie had not been cleaned for several days . ' His pupils were fixed and dilated . Paramedics could not get Magbie to respond verbally to a ' pain stick ' or to ammonia . <p> Both paramedics stated that the CTF physician they consulted upon arrival informed them that Magbie probably had been in this state for several hours before being noticed . . . . They assessed his vital signs as unstable and determined that he needed to be transported to the hospital immediately . . . . The paramedics stated that they were delayed approximately 20-30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transport paperwork had been completed and Magbie 's blood sugar level had been taken . CTF physicians denied this when interviewed . <p> The paramedics could not get their stretcher into Magbie 's cell , and the medical staff did not know how to operate his wheelchair in order to move it into the hallway . Consequently , Magbie was lifted out of his chair and taken out of the room to the stretcher . <p> One paramedic stated that while they were trying to move Magbie out of the CTF as quickly as possible , a correctional officer was trying to handcuff Magbie . <p>  --  Excerpt from " Special Report : Quality of Care Issues Related to the Custody of Jonathan Magbie , " October 2005 , by the Office of the Inspector General , Government of the District of Columbia . <p> This is the 12th column to be written about Jonathan Magbie , a 27-year-old man who was paralyzed from the neck down at age 4 after being struck by a drunk driver . Magbie lived at home with his mother , needed private nursing care at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others because he could n't use any of his limbs . He got around in a motorized wheelchair that he operated with his mouth , and his breathing was aided by a tracheotomy tube and an implanted diaphragmatic pacemaker . <p> Of all the accounts obtained and reported about Magbie 's treatment while in custody of the D.C. government , this IG report , which I obtained from a confidential D.C. government source , contains , by far , the most horrifying and disgusting details . It documents incompetence , neglect and dishonesty . And it describes the unforgivably slovenly behavior directed toward Magbie once Superior Court Judge Judith Retchin so inexplicably turned over a quadriplegic to the D.C. Department of Corrections on Sept. 20 , 2004 . <p> And why ? <p> Because Magbie pleaded guilty to the possession of marijuana found in his vehicle , which was being driven at the time by his cousin . Magbie , purchaser of the weed , was a first-time offender . Retchin , who the record shows was fully aware of Magbie 's incapacitation , nonetheless sentenced him to 10 days in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the payment of a $50 victim 's assessment . <p> The city got its hands on Magbie on Monday . By Friday , he was dead . <p> We now know the truth  --  or as much as can be learned without a public trial with witnesses forced to testify under oath  --  thanks to City Administrator Robert Bobb , who refused to accept an obscenely weak investigative report by the D.C. Health Department 's Health Regulation Administration that was issued a few months after Magbie 's death . <p> The IG 's 64-page report should be a must-read for Retchin , Superior Court Chief Judge Rufus King and all other judges and magistrates who sentence men and women to the custody of the D.C. Corrections Department . The correctional officers and medical staff who handled  --  or , more accurately , mishandled  --  Magbie are still in place , drawing their paychecks . <p> Phil Mendelson ( D-At Large ) , chairman of the D.C. Council 's Judiciary Committee , which oversees Corrections , and David Catania ( I-At Large ) , chairman of the Health Committee , which oversees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The agencies under their jurisdiction make a mockery of the council 's vaunted oversight . <p> Oh , yes  --  the bureaucracy can produce written policies and procedures that make them appear as models of efficiency , as the IG report notes . But noncompliance , as in Magbie 's case , is the rule . Those departments are , in truth , peppered with full-strength , trifling workers who get by doing next to nothing , all on the taxpayers ' dime . The problem is that most of their supervisors , quality-wise , are n't much better . <p> This much we now know , thanks to Mr. Bobb and the IG : <p> * The D.C. jail could not provide Magbie with the ventilator he advised both the jail and Greater Southeast Community Hospital that he needed . Magbie was taken to Greater Southeast the first night of his incarceration because of respiratory distress , but the hospital nonetheless sent him back ; Greater Southeast staffers " knew there was no ventilator at the jail , " the IG reported . No rationale for that decision could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , despite Retchin 's representation in court , were not prepared to accommodate Magbie 's medical needs . <p> * The CTF 's nurses did not follow doctor 's orders , properly document their care or give the full range of treatment and care ordered and required . <p> * There is no documentation that CTF physicians made daily rounds , no physician progress notes for two days of Magbie 's incarceration , no up-to-date information on his health , progress , changes or needs . <p> * There is no Health Department oversight of the CTF and jail medical operations , thus allowing both to function " at higher risk for undetected , systemic problems and medical errors that could affect inmate care and health , " the report says . <p> The detailed description of their noncompliance is enough to make the blood boil . <p> The IG lacked authority to investigate the Superior Court 's officers and employees involved with Magbie . Too bad . The court will never tell on itself . So we may never learn the fate of the medical-alert form that Magbie 's lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken off to jail after sentencing . <p> The IG report said a Superior Court official stated that a court employee gave the form to two contract correctional officers who took custody of Magbie . The correctional officer who received the court paperwork stated , however , that it did not contain a medical-alert form on Magbie . <p> We do n't have an independent evaluation of actions by Superior Court judges , officers or employees , who by law are above the city 's reach . Do n't count on any help from the D.C. commission that oversees judicial conduct and is chaired by William Lightfoot , a personal-injury lawyer and former politician . I 'd rather turn to the three blind mice . <p> Maybe with the Superior Court 's congressional protector , Rep. Tom DeLay ( R-Tex. ) , occupied with his own problems , Capitol Hill will review the court 's actions both before and after Magbie 's death . Otherwise , the public and Magbie 's family will be treated with the contempt that court officials reserve for inquiring minds in the press . <p> Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's page of contradictory statements  --  a list of conflicting testimony by witnesses with direct knowledge of the events involving Magbie . Truth , unfortunately , is still taking a beating . <p> But the tragic and unnecessary death of Jonathan Magbie may have one saving grace : We 've finally got the goods on a rotten system . <p> kingc@washpost.com
