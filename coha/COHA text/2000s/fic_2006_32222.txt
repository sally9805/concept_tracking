Stop That Girl By Elizabeth McKenzie Random House Elizabeth McKenzie STOP THAT GIRL My mother and I lived alone then , in a pink bungalow in Long Beach , with a small yard full of gopher holes and the smell of the refinery settling over everything we had . We could n't leave our glasses on the shelves a week without them gathering a fine mist of oil . I thought we had a real life anyway , before my mother started over . We employed a stocky Yorkshire woman to walk me home from school past the barbershop with the unhappy mynah bird . " Kill me ! " it suggested as we passed by . I never knew my father . Named Ransom , he was some frat boy who danced well . Mom believed I 'd have a leveler head . My mother worked in petroleum research . She was a geology major in college and went to field camps in Wyoming and was renowned for shooting a bobcat at a hundred yards while it was cuffing around her professor 's beagle . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if there might be something useful up there . Mom felt her job was a joke . When she came home at night , she locked herself in the bathroom for an hour , taking a hot bath filled with salts . She was said to look like Lauren Bacall in those days and dated a few of the engineers from the refinery . While Mom went searching for her purse and coat , they would bribe me with something , like it was up to me to release her : Silly Putty , a magnet , a comic book , a stuffed pig with a music box in it . There we are in Long Beach the fall I 'm nearly eight , when the nights have grown cooler and our gas wall unit bangs out its stale-smelling heat , and we 're on the brink of changes so vast it 's hard to believe we do n't see them coming . One Saturday evening , we receive a new visitor in the form of Roy Weeks , a real estate broker , a handsome talker with dimples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks like a bloody eyeball . He brings a bouquet as big as a baby , and my mother holds it that way . He slips me a piece of Dubble Bubble . By the following week it 's a Slip ' N Slide . I suspect he appeals to that secret Wild West part of my mother , but it 's more . A few months later my mother tells me , " Roy 's taking us both out for a drive today , Ann . We 're going to see a house . " I sit in the backseat of Roy 's Pontiac as we leave Long Beach behind . We aim for the San Fernando Valley . " You mean we 're going to buy a house out here ? " I ask Mom . We 're in the Encino hills ; compared to Long Beach it looks like paradise . Huge ranch houses and big yards ; rosebushes , hibiscus , banana trees , palms . " Well , maybe , " my mother says , turning around in her seat like she has something to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " From Roy ? " " No , with him . We might all live out here together . " " Ann , are you ready for that ? " Roy says , eyeing me in his mirror . I realize what they 're trying to tell me . We pull up in front of a huge , shingled yellow house , as long as the entire row of bungalows in Long Beach . My mother looks stunned as we wander into the place . It has beamed ceilings , parquet floors , a kitchen with an island and double range , a breakfast nook and bar , a family room , three bedrooms , three baths , two fireplaces , and a den . They show me the room that would be mine ; it has sheer pink curtains and wallpaper with ballerinas on it , something for a well-defined girl . When we finish inspecting the place , Roy Weeks says , " Ann , hit me right here ! As hard as you can ! " He is pointing at his stomach . I do n't ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting . " He winks at my mother . My hand hurts . I kick him in the shin . l Nine months later , Mrs. Weeks has retired from petroleum work , pregnant . In the afternoons , in our new palace , she sews clothes and toys and bedding for the baby , placing them in the nursery-to-be , while I 'm thinking of names . Percy is the one I 'm rooting for . Quiet collects in the rooms of that big house more than anywhere we 've lived . I often tell my mother it 's a tomb , and she says , " Ann , I love this man . But you are still the most important person in the world to me "  - -  the words I live for -- and I skate around the parquet floor in my socks , still feeling like it 's all just temporary . I still ca n't believe that another family has moved into the pink bungalow , that the woman I called Nana has returned to Leeds , and that a few friends from my school in Long Beach write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved across the world . " How about a swim ? " Mom asks me after school nowadays . " Maybe . " I come out into the backyard after a while and see my mother , in her white flowered bathing cap , doing graceful laps up and down the pool . This is no kidney-shaped job , as Roy points out . It 's a classic rectangle of crystal blue , and my eyes follow the long wake of my mother 's stroke . " Come on in , " Mom calls to me . To surprise my mother , I say " Okay " and walk straight into the pool with all my clothes on . She laughs and does n't get mad at me for possibly ruining my leather shoes . It 's in the afternoons after school when I know I still have an impact on her . Once Roy 's home , she acts like he 's our savior . One evening he insists we accompany him to some open-house thing , and I climb onto the roof of the Pontiac and wo n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pregnant mother says , waiting swaybacked by the car . Roy snaps at my ankles like a crab . " From up here I can see the reservoir , " I say . " I think boys are peeing into it . " " That 's nice ; let 's go . " " Is that , like , what we drink ? " Roy stalks around the car and I hop to the other side . He charges back , and this time I slip off . I fall onto the concrete and no matter how much it hurts I decide I wo n't cry . Instead I pretend I 'm in a coma . " Ann ? " my mother says . " Are you all right ? Look what you did ! " she yells at Roy Weeks . " Faker , " he replies . He tickles me . I sink my teeth into his arm . He slaps me across the top of the head , and my mother tells Roy never to lay a hand on me again . Roy tells my mother I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hear myself saying , " And you 're a homewrecker . " And thus , the following weekend , it 's decided I 'm spending some time with The Frosts . The Frosts are my grandparents , but when we talk about them we always call them The Frosts . Until then , I 'd only seen them once or twice a year because my mother hates them . They are young and have busy schedules for grandparents -- Sherwood 's a civil engineer , Liz a pediatrician . Mom grew up a lonely daydreamer with no brothers or sisters . That 's her rationale for the new baby : so things will be different for me . Friday afternoon Dr. Frost shows up to collect me . She looks like my mother but is smaller and more efficient , never a moment to kill . I do n't know her very well . " Put on a dress with a nice collar , Ann . And comb your hair . I want you to look pretty for your passport . " " Why do I need a passport ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What trip ? " " You 're coming to Europe with me . I 'm attending a medical conference . You 're going to straighten out and learn your place in the world . Good deal ? " " Europe ? " I say , looking at my mother . " When ? " " Next month , " Dr. Frost says . Next month is May . May is a big month . May is when Mom is having the baby . " I ca n't go , " I say . " I need to be here for the baby . " " You 've been a big help already , " my mother says . " I need to help more ! " Dr. Frost says , " After we have your picture taken , let 's go buy some new clothes , shall we ? I 'm going to need some new things myself . " " I do n't need any new clothes . " " All right , then , we 'll just get your picture taken , " Dr. Frost says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is definitely bizarre and grotesque , " my favorite expression in many situations . Then I add my other : " It 's also grossly mutilated and hugely deformed . " " Ann , your grandmother has offered to take you to Europe . You 're a very lucky girl . " Lucky ? Who needs parquet floors and a pool . Who needs Europe with the very person who makes my mother scream or cry whenever they talk on the phone . I try to catch my mother 's eye , the special eye that knows me better than anyone , and say , " I do n't want to go . " But the eye does n't blink . There 's no hope . Though they disagree on everything else , they 're together on this one . Mom tells me , " The baby might not even come while you 're gone , who knows . " Roy ca n't make it to the airport . Neither can Granddad . I hug my mother and pat her stomach , which looks square now , like a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ croak out . " I 'll try , " my mother says . l Our travels take us first to Copenhagen , city of copper domes turned green and raw beef . I 'm in Europe . I 'm excited . I tell myself I 'll see yodelers and eat lots of chocolate and buy souvenirs for my mother and the people I 've been meeting at my new school . Even Dr. Frost seems to have loosened up . She 's humming and smiling without explaining why . Our second night there , in a quaint hotel with floors tilted like a fun house , we receive a telegram from Roy Weeks : Wonderful news STOP We have a daughter Katherine Louise STOP Mother and baby fine . " Who 's we ? " I say , grabbing the telegram . It hits me for the first time that my sister 's father is Roy Weeks . " Can I call Mom at the hospital ? " Dr. Frost says we 'll send a telegram instead . " Can we go home now ? " " Ann , you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ugly little things with red faces . They do n't even open their eyes . " " Really ? " I slide in my socks to the lower wall . Tivoli Gardens sparkles across the street . From her bag my grandmother hauls out a textbook she has brought on this trip to instruct me with . It contains pictures of every bone , every muscle , every lymph gland ; the cardiovascular , digestive , and nervous systems : the works . " Tell me about dissecting cadavers , " I ask her . " Nothing to it , " Dr. Frost says . " But you were cutting open dead bodies . Was n't it bizarre and grotesque ? " " Ann , the body is an amazing machine . It 's not bizarre and grotesque at all . " She points at a skeleton . I want to hear exciting stories about guts , not her cooled down version of them . " Dead bodies are wonderful , newborn babies are really gross ? " " Good night , Ann , " she says . " Maybe we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignores me in a different way , pretending not to hear . I pull the covers up around my neck and fall asleep , hearing my grandmother listing bones . From the Hardcover edition .
