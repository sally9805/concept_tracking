<p> Iraq 's leading political blocs on Sunday agreed to replace the speaker of Parliament , Mahmoud Mashhadani , a Sunni , after hearing accusations that his bodyguards assaulted a Shiite lawmaker as the speaker cursed him and then dragged him to the speaker 's office . <p> Four lawmakers and an aide confirmed the details of the skirmish and the effort to remove Mr. Mashhadani , including Saleem Abdullah , a member of Parliament and spokesman for Mr. Mashhadani 's bloc , the Iraqi Consensus Front . <p> Mr. Abdullah said the new speaker would probably be another Sunni Arab . " We are now in negotiations to find another candidate , " he said . <p> Mr. Abdullah said discussions about " how to arrange the exit " were not complete , suggesting that Mr. Mashhadani had not agreed to leave . On Sunday night , Mr. Mashhadani could not be reached for comment . <p> If carried out , however , the move would come at an already difficult time for Iraq 's largest elected body . Mr. Mashhadani 's tenure , which began after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volatility , sectarian division among members and legislative inertia . <p> The 275-member Parliament has yet to produce a law establishing how to share revenues from the country 's oil , a plan for local elections or any of the other so-called benchmark laws that American officials have been demanding . Frequently , attendance has fallen short of a quorum , and in April a suicide bomber killed one lawmaker and wounded 22 people in the Parliament 's cafeteria . <p> The scuffle on Sunday was the third time this year that Mr. Mashhadani or members of his staff have been accused of physically assaulting members of Parliament . Last month , Mr. Mashhadani slapped a Sunni lawmaker who questioned his decision to rush out of a legislative session in disgust after a Shiite colleague questioned the government 's sensitivity to the plight of displaced Shiite families . <p> In that instance , Mr. Mashhadani apologized and kept his job . This time , Kurdish , Shiite and some Sunni leaders said they would no longer tolerate Mr. Mashhadani 's short temper and thuggish approach . <p> Fariyad Muhammad , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened during a closed session of Parliament . Several members who were present , including at least one who said he witnessed parts of the skirmish , said that Mr. Muhammad said he was trying to enter the building Sunday morning when Mr. Mashhadani 's guards stopped and shoved him . <p> Mr. Muhammad , a member of the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council , said the speaker soon appeared and shouted , " Damn you . " He said Mr. Mashhadani watched as his guards forcibly dragged him to the speaker 's section of the building . <p> The Shiite deputy speaker , Khalid al-Attiya , rushed to Mr. Mashhadani 's office to smooth over the dispute . But several members of Parliament , after hearing Mr. Muhammad 's account  --  delivered without Mr. Mashhadani present  --  said they had agreed to replace the speaker . <p> " It 's not just about what happened today , " said Jalal al-Din al-Sagheer , a member of Mr. Muhammad 's party . " We exploded with anger because today 's actions were part of an accumulation of problems , one by one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kurds , in a rare moment of unity , simply agreed that Mr. Mashhadani had lost the credibility to lead . <p> Mr. Mashhadani would still hold a seat in Parliament even if forced out as speaker . <p> Outside of Parliament , the conflicts were far more deadly . <p> In Tikrit , about 90 miles northwest of Baghdad , at least eight policemen were killed and 20 people were wounded on Sunday when a suicide bomber drove a truck filled with explosives into a police station . Rescue workers worked feverishly into the evening to remove rubble to save policemen buried underneath . <p> One trapped officer , Salah al-Jibouri , said he used his cellphone while buried in the debris to call the other police units and tell them that a huge explosion had demolished the building . <p> In Tuz Khurmatu , east of Tikrit , a roadside bomb struck a convoy of Kurdish pesh merga forces , killing one soldier and wounding three others , as they drove north from Baghdad after patrolling the western neighborhoods of the capital . <p> The American military said one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southern Baghdad on Sunday during " combat operations . " A soldier was fatally shot and another one was wounded on Saturday in Diyala Province , the military said . <p> Clashes also broke out late Saturday between American forces and militiamen of the Mahdi Army , which is loyal to the cleric Moktada al-Sadr , on the eastern outskirts of Baghdad , killing at least two civilians and wounding 10 more , an Interior Ministry official said . <p> One resident , who declined to give his name , said American aircraft attacked the area for one hour , killing four civilians and destroying three houses . Later , he said , roadside bombs struck American armored vehicles , and 15 people were wounded in the ensuing early morning clash . <p> An American military spokesman in Baghdad , Lt. Col. Christopher Garver , disputed the account , saying the fighting began because men inside one of Mr. Sadr 's satellite offices attacked an American patrol with rifles and rocket-propelled grenades . He said the Americans called in helicopters for support , and no Americans were hurt . <p> Across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interior Ministry reported . Two civilians were killed and two wounded by a sniper in southwest Baghdad . Three bombs in two southern Baghdad districts killed five civilians and wounded 15 . <p> In Iskandariya , south of Baghdad , a suicide bomber collapsed a section of a bridge , wounding several American soldiers guarding the crossing , The Associated Press reported . <p> The Iraqi High Tribunal hearing the case of Ali Hassan al-Majid , known as " Chemical Ali , " said it deferred the verdict announcement until June 24 . Mr. Majid , who oversaw the so-called Anfal campaign that killed tens of thousands of Kurds in the late 1980s , is charged with crimes against humanity and war crimes . <p> Prosecutors have asked for the death penalty against him and four other defendants . <p> #
