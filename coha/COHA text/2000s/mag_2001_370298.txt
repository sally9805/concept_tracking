Laura Nyro , just 19 and wearing a black gown with an angel 's wing on her shoulder , got booed off the stage at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival . That may help explain why , for the rest of her career , this rock innovator shied away from the limelight , writing songs that others turned into hits ( Stoned Soul Picnic for the 5th Dimension ; And When I Die for Blood , Sweat and Tears ; Stoney End for Barbra Streisand ) . The crowd at that landmark Monterey festival was more into high-energy rockers like Janis Joplin , for whom performing was as intoxicating as the heroin that eventually killed her , in 1970 , at age 27 . <P> Both Joplin and Nyro ( who died of cancer in 1997 ) are back together onstage , after a fashion  --  each being celebrated in a new off-Broadway show . In Eli 's Comin ' , five performers ( including golden-voiced Broadway vet Judy Kuhn ) wend their way through a bookless compendium of 20 of Nyro 's best-known songs . Though assembled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York City ; by the end she 's sharing confessions with what looks like a therapy group ) , the show works best  --  marvelously  --  as a showcase for Nyro 's idiosyncratic and influential music , a lush , emotionally vivid , rhythmically complex mixture of folk , rock , gospel and jazz . <P> Love , Janis is a more ambitious but less satisfying show , in which well-amplified renditions of Joplin 's hits ( Piece of My Heart , Me and Bobby McGee ) are interspersed with excerpts from letters to her parents . It 's overlong and a bit overblown : so great was Joplin 's talent that it takes two performers ( one sings ; the other does most of the talking ) to encompass her . Make that three : because of the role 's " vocal demands , " two performers alternate nights as the singing Janis . <P> So is this theater , or a classic-rock FM station ? The hits of the ' 60s and ' 70s have lately become as ubiquitous on the legit stage as the endlessly recycled standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nyro and Joplin , Jim Morrison and his life and music were the subject of another recent off-Broadway show . The ' 70s hits of the Swedish rock band Abba make up the score for Mamma Mia !  --  a hit in London that 's due on Broadway this fall . A new Beatles musical , All You Need Is Love , is about to open in London , and a show with music by the ' 70s band Queen is in the works . Fittingly , New York City 's critically acclaimed Encores ! series , which mounts concert versions of " classic " American musicals , earlier this month crossed the great divide  --  rediscovering the rock musical Hair . <P> There is belated justice in all this activity . The advent of rock was the reason Broadway show music got shunted to the fringes of the pop-culture world . A whole generation of talented rock composers steered clear of the theater  --  at least , the sort of theater where the band is in the pit , not on the stage , and the audience applauds politely from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producers have looked for ways of bringing the music of rock 's classic period to theater audiences . It 's a smart commercial move : at their best , these shows can lure both the young ( more apt to visit the theater if it disguises itself as a rock concert ) and the getting-old ( baby boomers who love any opportunity to revisit the playlist of their youth ) .
