The Drowntown day market was in full spate . Fawn 's nostrils flared at the strong smells : fish , clams , critters with twitching legs like giant crawdads packed in seaweed ; frying funnel cakes , boiling crabs , dried fruit , cheeses ; piles of used clothing not well laundered ; chickens , goats , sheep , horses . Mixed with it all , the damp tang of the river Gray , stretching so wide its farther shore became a flat blur in the winter morning light . <p> The lead-colored water shimmered in silence beyond the bright busy blot of folks collected under the bluffs that divided Graymouth 's Uptown from its noisier  --  and , Fawn had to admit , more noisome  --  riverside . The muddy banks were lined with flatboats at the ends of their journeys , keelboats preparing new starts , and fishing and coastal vessels that came and went more in rhythm with the still-ten-miles-distant sea than with the river 's moods . The streets dodged crookedly around goods-sheds , rivermen 's taverns , and shacks  --  all built of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismantled but drawn ashore intact on rollers by oxen and allowed to settle into the soil . The owners of the latter claimed to be all ready for the next flood that would try , and fail , to wash the smells and mess of Drowntown out to sea , while Uptown looked down dry-skirted . It seemed a strange way to live . How had she ever thought of the rocky creek at the foot of her family 's farm back north as a river ? <p> Fawn shoved her basket up her arm , nudged her companion Remo , and pointed . " Look ! There 's some new Lakewalkers here this morning ! " <p> At the other end of the square , where all the bigger animals were displayed by their hopeful owners , two women and a man tended a string of half a dozen leggy horses . The three all wore Lakewalker dress : riding trousers , sturdy boots , shirts and leather vests and jackets , not so different in kind from the farmers around them , yet somehow distinctive . More distinctive was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height , and their air of discomfort to be surrounded by so many people who were n't Lakewalkers . Upon reflection , Fawn wondered if anyone else here realized the standoffishness was discomfort , or if they only thought it high-nosed disdain . She would have seen it that way , once . <p> " Mm , " said Remo unenthusiastically . " I suppose you want to go talk to them ? " <p> " Of course . " Fawn dragged him toward the far end of the market . <p> The man pulled a horse out of the string and held it for a farmer , who bent and ran his hands over its legs . The two young women looked toward Fawn and Remo as they approached ; their eyes widened a bit at Remo , whose height , clothes , and long black braid also proclaimed him a Lakewalker patroller . Did their groundsenses reached out to touch the stranger-kinsman , or did they keep them closed against the painful ground noise of the surrounding farmers ? <p> The southern Lakewalkers Fawn had seen so far tended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and these two were no exception . The taller woman  --  girl  --  she seemed not so very much older than Fawn , anyhow  --  had hair in a single thick plait as tawny as a bobcat pelt . Her silvery-blue eyes were bright in her fine-boned face . The shorter woman had red-brown braids wreathing her head , and coppery eyes in a round face dusted with freckles . Fawn thought they might be patrol partners , like Remo and Barr ; they seemed unlikely to be sisters . <p> " ' Morning ! " Fawn called cheerfully , looking up at them . The top of her own dark curls came up just past the middle of Remo 's chest , and not much farther on these women . At almost-nineteen , Fawn had given up hope of gaining further inches except maybe around , and resigned herself to a permanent crick in her neck . <p> The reddish-haired woman returned a nod ; the bobcat blonde , seeming uncertain how to take the odd pair , addressed herself to a height halfway between them . " ' Morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some real fine bloodstock , here . Strong hooves . One of these could carry a man all the way up the Tripoint Trace and never pull up lame . " She gestured toward the string , well brushed despite their winter coats , who gazed back and flicked their tufted ears . Beyond , the Lakewalker man trotted the horse toward and away from the farmer , who stood hands on hips , frowning judiciously . <p> " I thought Lakewalkers only sold off their culls to farmers ? " said Fawn innocently . The redhead 's slight flinch was more from guilt than insult , Fawn thought . Some horse traders . Suppressing a grin , she went on : " Anyhow , no , at least not today . What I was wondering was , what camp you folks hailed from , and if you have any real good medicine makers there . " <p> The blonde replied at once , in a practiced-sounding tone , " Lakewalkers ca n't treat farmers . " <p> " Oh , I know all about that . " Fawn tossed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Two braided heads turned toward Remo , who blushed . Remo hated to blush , he 'd said , because the awkwardness of it always made him blush worse than the original spur . Fawn watched his deepening tinge with fascination . She could not sense the flick of questing groundsenses , but she had no doubt that a couple went by just then . " No , I 'm not sick , either , " Remo said . " It 's not for us . " <p> " Are you two together ? " asked the blonde , silver-blue eyes narrowing in a less friendly fashion . Lovers together , Fawn guessed she meant to imply , which Lakewalkers were emphatically not supposed to be with farmers . <p> " Yes . No ! Not like that . Fawn 's a friend , " said Remo . " The wife of a friend , " he added in hasty emphasis . <p> " We still ca n't help you . Medicine makers ca n't fool with farmers , " the redhead seconded her companion . <p> " Dag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself from clutching the Lakewalker wedding braid circling her left wrist under her sleeve . Or brandishing it , leading to the eternal explanation and defense of its validity . " And he 's not sick . " Exactly . " He used to be a patroller , but he thinks he has a calling now for making . He already knows lots , and he can do some , some amazing things , which is why he needs a real good guide , to help him along his next step . " Whatever it is . Even Dag did not seem sure , to Fawn 's concerned eyes . <p> <br> Continues ...
