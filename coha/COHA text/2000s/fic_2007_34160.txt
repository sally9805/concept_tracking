Six o'clock in the morning . It was one of Liz 's favorite times of day : everyone else asleep , Brody still motionless in the bed she 'd just left , the kids upstairs , in sleep not teenagers anymore but simply larger versions of their younger , childish selves , who , she could almost believe , would wake and seek her for body comfort , as they used to . They were thirteen and fifteen , but she could still open their doors and look at them sleeping : how Joe lay on his back with half his blankets kicked to the side , his mouth slightly open ; how Lauren folded her limbs in close , her head sandwiched between two pillows , a fist curled under her chin . In the kitchen , Liz spooned coffee into the Krups and leaned in for a whiff of the dark , rich smell . She got out four plates and four juice glasses . Moving to the calendar , she did a quick pro forma check of the day , but she knew : soccer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the late side because of his tennis game . Lauren did nothing after school this year , and Liz had taken to planning labor-intensive dinners so she 'd be in the kitchen if Lauren wanted her . Jambalaya tonight ? She 'd go grocery shopping after her yoga class . Outside , the newspaper lay on the lawn , its plastic wrapper wet with dew . She bent over for it , then looked up and down the street . The houses in this neighborhood were at once ample and modest , with lovinglytended small front yards . Sixteen years ago , buying here had seemed a compromise : it was n't Palo Alto , but it was nice , and the schools were good , and she and Brody reassured themselves that Palo Alto would still be there when they had more money . Now they had more money , but they stayed . They were comfortable here . It was home . She left the paper in the kitchen and tiptoed through the bedroom to the bathroom . She loved the first blast of the shower on her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup water at her cheeks , her eyes . She massaged shampoo into her scalp , then turned and let the water course through her hair . When she turned back it beat at her nipples , and she twisted them , felt a tingling between her legs . It had been a while since she and Brody had made love , and she was ready . Was he ? They were a little out of sync , she sometimes felt . In the bedroom she began to dress , opening drawers as quietly as she could , though he was beginning to stir . " Time is it ? " he muttered after a short while . She turned around , saw he had n't moved . " About six-thirty . " He raised himself up and looked at her , then sank down and lay on his back . She skirted the bed and sat near him on the edge of the mattress . His chest was bare , and she laid her hand over his breastbone , its bloom of graying hairs . " OK , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OK , " she said with a smile . She left him and went upstairs to the kids . Lauren was likely to be awake already , and Liz hesitated , then turned the doorknob slowly . She pushed the door open but waited a moment before moving over the threshold . Lauren was on her back , looking at the door . It seemed to Liz that she had been waiting for this moment , had even girded herself for it : pulling the covers all the way to her chin , making sure her head was in the very center of her pillow . She stared hard at Liz but did n't speak . " Morning , sweetie , " Liz said , but still Lauren did n't speak , did n't react at all . Something was going on with her these days , Liz did n't know what . It was almost as if the last three years had never happened , and she was still twelve : sullen and aggrieved . Though Friday night she 'd abruptly changed her mind about spending Saturday in Berkeley with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never would have canceled anything involving even one other girl . " Almost time to get up , " Liz said now . " I know , " Lauren said with a sneer . " I 'm not stupid . " Liz pulled the door to and headed for Joe 's room . Lauren 's tone seemed to have lodged inside her : she felt it harden like a fast-drying coat of shellac on her lungs . Outside Joe 's room she took a deep , slow breath to break it up . Long ago she 'd replaced Joe 's curtains with blackout shades , and it was very dark in his room , the only light coming from the hallway behind her . She crossed to his bed and sat down . Already he 'd turned off the alarm clock that he set , every night , for six-thirty . He was crafty , never just hitting the snooze button but actually sliding the setting to off . " Joe , " she said . His head was turned to the wall , and she put a hand on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He burrowed deeper , and as always she felt torn : she wanted to adjust the covers over him , to encourage his sleep , make his bed the nicest place possible ; and she wanted , needed , to get him up . She shook his shoulder again . " Joe . " " I 'm awake . " " Right . " " I am . I swear . " She patted his shoulder and left the room , knowing she 'd come again in five minutes . She tried hard to make them independent , but there was a cost to her , and some things she could n't give up . Yet . In the kitchen she began breakfast . She sliced a pear into a bowl of blackberries , unwrapped a loaf of challah , and cut it into thick slices . She put jam and honey on the table , then went back to Joe . " It 's time , " she said to his sleeping body . He hunkered farther , bringing the covers over his face . " It 's time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's almost seven . " " Urf , " he moaned , but the position of his body changed , and after a while she could tell he was awake . " No , " he said . " I 'm afraid so . " She tweaked his foot and then left the room and headed toward Lauren 's nearly closed door , but before she could speak Lauren 's voice came at her , brusque and preemptive : " Mom , I 'm up ! " Liz retreated . Down in the kitchen again , she put challah slices in the toaster and poured herself a second cup of coffee . She sometimes regretted the second cup at yoga , but she missed it too much when she skipped it . In a few minutes Lauren came into the kitchen . She moved slowly , and her unbrushed hair fell in clumps past her shoulders , collected in the hood of her oversize gray sweatshirt . " Sweetie , " Liz said without meaning to , and Lauren gave her a sour look . " What ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round of bread in the toaster and watched in her peripheral vision as Lauren moved around the table and pulled out her chair . When the toaster popped , Liz buttered the new slices , put them all on a plate , and took them to the table . " Here we go . " Lauren reached for a piece of toast and took a bite , and Liz thought , You 're welcome . Then she wished she could unthink it . She hated how pissy she felt-it was n't the kind of mother she wanted to be . Brody came in , dressed in a white shirt and tie , and she remembered that he 'd mentioned a meeting out of the office today . He passed close by her on his way to the coffeemaker , and she caught a whiff of his soap smell , watched as he found a mug and pulled the coffeepot out of its base . His nice broad back seemed broader in the white shirt . He turned and faced her for his first sip , and she thought about how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress shirt and tie . That 's because he reminds you of your father , Sarabeth had remarked about this , in her usual perspicacious way . Now Joe arrived , reaching for a slice of challah before he 'd even sat down , then consuming it in two bites and chasing it with a large gulp of juice . He 'd shot up over the summer , and he was gangly now , with enormous wrists . She took her seat and watched as he helped himself to fruit , took more toast , pulled his juice glass a little closer : gathered what he needed to stock himself for the day . He looked up at her as he stabbed a pear slice . " Are you driving us to practice ? " " I 'm not sure yet , " she said . " I 'll drop your gear at Trent 's if I 'm not . Are you packed ? " " How is our friend Trent ? " Brody said as he came over and sat down . " That was quite a play he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfolded his napkin and then unfolded it again and tucked a corner into his collar . He turned to Lauren and said , " Did you know that the entire purpose of the necktie used to be to protect the shirt ? Now we have to protect the protector ! " " That 's the fullback 's job in soccer , " Joe said , and Brody winked at Liz as he turned back to Joe . " You 're quick this morning . " " No , I 'm not , " Joe said , but he smiled with pleasure , a wash of color high on each cheek . Liz looked at Lauren . She was spaced out , her expression vacant as she played with one of the many thick silver rings she wore . Let 's try again , Liz thought , but she was n't sure how . " You could get one of those plastic ties , " Joe said . " Like for a Halloween costume . " " Maybe I will , " Brody said . " That could solve all kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the challah , and she saw there was only one piece left . She said , " Oops , sorry , I 'll get some more of that . " He shrugged . " I can . " " No , no , I will . " She slid the last slice onto his plate and went back to the toaster , thinking for a moment that this was n't the best model for Lauren-or Joe , for that matter . The woman leaping to her feet . But she wanted to do it-she liked doing it . Was she supposed to pretend she did n't ? It was funny : most of the women she knew complained about their husbands ' uselessness at domestic tasks , but of course it was they who 'd allowed them to be useless . Liz did it , too-complained , too . There was this sisterhood out there , a sisterhood of eye rolling and head shaking and sighing over the helplessness of husbands . Liz had always enjoyed it , the standing around at the kids ' schools or soccer games saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or I 'm going out and leaving my kids with my husband tonight-before dinner , and everyone laughing . With Lauren and Joe older , Liz had less of that : the talking , the standing around . It was a little lonely with the kids older . Very soon the rush began : Brody looking for his BlackBerry ; Lauren disappearing into the bathroom ; Joe all over the house at once , searching for his backpack , his math homework , his lunch-oh , wait , he had hot lunch , and he 'd just remembered , he needed ten bucks for a student body card-no , today , today was the last day , it had to be today ; and then they were all gone . In the sudden silence Liz sat down again , licking her fingertip and pressing it to the toast crumbs on her plate . She found herself thinking of the brief conversation she 'd had with Sarabeth Saturday morning , when she 'd called to tell her Lauren would n't be in Berkeley after all . Lauren and her friends had planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Liz had n't wanted Sarabeth wondering all day if they would come . " Oh , too bad , " Sarabeth said in response to the news . " I was going to make chocolate meringues . " And Liz had gotten a clear picture of the picture Sarabeth must have had , of Lauren and her friends filling her funky little house with their teenage giggles and intermittent high seriousness . Liz was sorry they 'd canceled . She 'd call Sarabeth after yoga , see if she could come for dinner sometime soon . Chocolate meringues . That was the treat Sarabeth used to make for Lauren and Joe when they were little , when every few months Liz would load them into the car for a pilgrimage across the bay . In anticipation of these visits , Sarabeth would tape giant pieces of butcher paper to her living room floor , and once the meringues were consumed she 'd launch the kids on some labor-intensive drawing project-a giant forest , a city of towers-so that for a while at least Liz could sit on her couch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : hearing about Sarabeth 's romantic adventures , or learning more about a new project she had going-anything to interrupt the day-in , day-out sameness of life with small children . I 'll trade you , Sarabeth used to say . You could n't stand it for more than a day . Which was true , of course . The high school was on the north edge of town , across the street from a little shopping center with a Starbucks , a Subway , and a Jamba Juice . Kids were n't supposed to bring food over from the center , but everyone did , smuggling their Starbucks or Jamba Juice cups into their morning classes . The teachers did n't care , but it was a rule , and if the vice-principal saw you , you got busted . It was called getting cupped . Lauren had seen a freshman guy get cupped before school today , and it was so obvious he 'd done it on purpose . It was probably the highlight of his life , proving what a tough ass he was by getting detention in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her conscientious student look . Notebook open , pen in hand , thoughtful expression . It was ridiculously easy . If she felt Mr. Greenway 's eyes on her , she bit her lip as if she were struggling to understand something , then made a mark in her notebook . From far away she would look like she was taking notes , but in fact she was adding details to a picture of a tree she 'd drawn yesterday . A Japanese maple . She was terrible at the leaves . In fact , she sucked at drawing . Everyone used to say how good she was , but they were wrong . Across the aisle and one desk forward , Amanda twisted her copper-red hair around her finger . Her jeans were a little floody , and Lauren saw that she was wearing socks with smiley faces on them , as if she were still in middle school . Amanda could be so weird that way , not caring about stuff . They had four classes together this fall . " That 's great , " Lauren 's mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't , exactly . It was Amanda , and it was great in exact proportion to how it was not so great : it gave Lauren someone to hang out with , and it made it impossible for her to hang out with anyone else . " Great . " With Lauren 's mom everything was either " great " or " too bad . " What would you like me to say ? Lauren imagined her mom asking , and she turned away , then realized that she 'd actually turned away , actually moved her head , here in chemistry . She looked at Mr. Greenway , worried that he 'd noticed , but he was writing on the board , oblivious . The periodic table hung to his left . Lauren had not meant to look at it , but she 'd caught a glimpse-those rows of little boxes , the meaningless letters inside them - and her stomach flipped . It was the middle of October , and she could no longer maintain the pretense that she was going to start getting it soon . Every time Mr. Greenway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , listen , but something happened to his voice , like he just loved the periodic table , and she could n't listen . She spaced out . Sometimes she thought of the quilt on her parents ' bed , how when she was little she 'd lie there and play a game of mentally connecting like fabric with like fabric , a game to explain why the quilt was exactly as it was , as if it had to be . Or she 'd think about lunch : where she and Amanda might sit , and whether or not she 'd see what's-his-butt . Who , speaking of : class was almost over . Her heart pounded as she watched the classroom clock click from six of to five of . Just five minutes until the after-chemistry pass . She ran her fingers through her hair , then lowered her head and examined her teeth with her tongue . She cupped her hand under her mouth and exhaled , but her breath just smelled like the classroom , not that she ever got close enough for her breath to matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your cheeks to bring color to them , but color was n't a problem-her face was always on fire when she looked at him . At the moment she was also sweating between her boobs , which she absolutely hated . " Lab tomorrow , " Mr. Greenway was saying . " Do n't forget your flameproof suits . " He smiled his pathetic aren't-I-funny smile just as the bell rang , and Amanda turned and rolled her eyes at Lauren . " Do n't forget your dick brain , " she said , meaning Mr. Greenway 's , but Lauren was in no mood . She 'd missed the before-school locker pass , so she did n't even know what he was wearing today . She preferred this pass to take place out beyond the science complex , under the open sky rather than on the busy covered walkways , where she always felt invisible . Plus she could see him for longer out there , see him leaving his English class if she got out there early enough . Walking that swinging walk . His arms , his legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face got even hotter , if that was possible . Herself naked near him-she wanted to barf . " Laur-en , " Amanda said , and , nearly at the door , Lauren looked back . Amanda for some reason was still at her desk , still putting her stuff in her backpack . Fuck-now the pass would take place on the science walkways , no question . She might even be too late altogether . " Do you mind waiting ? " Amanda whined , and Lauren waited , and by the time she got outside it was too late : he was past her , heading for his physics class , wearing his blue T-shirt with the faded red ladder on the back , from his painting job two summers ago . On the front , she knew , just over his heart , it said : JEFF .
