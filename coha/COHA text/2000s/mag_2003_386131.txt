Section : NFL Guard is no glamour position , but as defensive tackles grow more prominent somebody must stop them . Guess who . <p> Yes , there are times when Ruben Brown feels like an anonymous part of the pile . He drive-blocks some 330-pound human stump for 6 or 7 seconds and then prays that the mass of humanity around him does n't collapse on his knee or ankle . He pass protects against an athletic freak who can bench-press an Escalade and still run a 4.7 , but then Brown hears about how the left tackle saved the quarterback by slowing down the speedy defensive end . <p> A guard 's life . You can have it . <p> Then comes the sunshine . He gets those plus-sized legs pumping and pulls into space . There 's a linebacker to pulverize . Or , better yet , some puny safety to mash . Suddenly , football is fun , and all the ugly trench warfare is worth it . <p> " The only reason I stick around and play , " says Brown , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defense and block the linebacker off the edge . That 's just a great feeling . If I had to drive-block all day , I would n't be playing . " <p> Brown is a left guard for the Bills . A damn good one . Seven Pro Bowls . Always listed among the game 's best at his position by those who know football . Makes good money . But in the hierarchy of offensive football , guards are at the bottom of the list , well behind the backs and ends . After the centers and the tackles . Heck , they trail every defensive position , too . Guards are largely anonymous , unless their team 's quarterback has just been big-splashed by one of those anatomical oddities who play defensive tackle . Then , everybody knows . The offensive line gets little attention to begin with , and guards can seem like after-thoughts . <p> " People think the left tackle is good because he has to block a fast guy out there on pass plays , but he 's just got a little basketball player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard , week in and week out , every team in the NFL has a stud at defensive tackle , and the people blocking them are guards . " <p> A quick look at the 2003 NFL draft shows just how important teams deem those run-stuffing , pocket-collapsing , uniform-stretching behemoths to whom Brown refers . Six defensive tackles were chosen among the first 25 picks . They join the honor roll of interior menaces already terrorizing the league , including Tampa Bay 's Warren Sapp , the gold standard for DTs . " It 's getting to the point where teams are 10 deep on the ( defensive ) line , " 49ers Pro Bowl right guard Ron Stone says . " It 's out of control . Defensive tackles are the ones getting paid these days . " <p> And it 's the guard 's job to stop them . The funny thing is , Stone and his peers were n't necessarily born to play the position . Most were tackles in high school and college . Stone was a tackle at Boston College ; Brown played tackle at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were switched - and not just because the personnel folks realized they were n't tall enough to meet the unspoken minimum requirements ( about 6-6 , 320 ) to play outside . Offensive line coaches wanted them as guards because Brown and Stone could handle the position 's requirement of strength , quickness and brains . That 's why Giants line coach Jim McNally was so disappointed when third-year man Rich Seubert was lost for the season with a broken leg in Week 7 . At 6-5 , 305 , Seubert is athletic enough to have played some tight end in college and is perfect for the Giants ' multiple attack . McNally insists Seubert can take the wrong step at the snap yet recover and make the proper play , thanks to his quickness . <p> " If you just drafted all tackles and took the best athletes and made them guards , you 'd be all right , " McNally says . " Guards have to block the big guys inside . They have to be smart enough to work with the tackle and center . They have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be mobile enough to cut off the nose tackle and pull around to get the line-backer . <p> " They have to be big enough . They have to be athletic . They have to be mobile . " <p> Ask Steelers Pro Bowl guard Alan Faneca about life in the middle of the line , and he repeats the mantra he has heard from coaches since he began playing inside . " Do n't hang around the pile , " Faneca says . <p> Sounds easy , right ? Hey , a guard 's address is Pile , USA . Successful teams must be strong up the middle , just like a baseball nine , because the ball starts there , the action often settles there , and the quarterback is there . Breakdowns in the middle lead to big trouble . " That 's a straight shot to the quarterback , " Stone says . " If a tackle gets beaten outside , the quarterback can step up . " <p> The discussion of guards so often focuses on their need to pull quickly enough to catch a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their value in the passing game . While tackles must keep the game 's defensive celebrities - the speed rushers - from assaulting the pocket on the outside , they can get help from backs , tight ends and sometimes even guards . <p> Guards must prevent human locomotives from charging through the middle , often with no help . " It 's paramount to know where your help is coming from , " Faneca says . " And if you know none is ; coming , you better sit inside and make sure you do n't get beat in that hole . " <p> Matching up with someone such as Sapp one-on-one on passing downs is a guard 's No. l Stressor . " You 're in a phone booth against those guys , a smaller area , so there 's less room for them to get around you , " Chiefs Pro Bowl guard Will Shields says . " But if you miss , they 're right on the quarterback . " <p> After spending so many downs blocking the tackles , guards almost smile when defenses play games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love it when teams send guys off the edge , because the toughest thing for a guard to block is a good pass rusher lined up right on top of you , " Brown says . " If somebody comes charging off the edge , I 'll pull off the middle and knock his head off . Drew ( Bledsoe , the Bills ' quarterback ) will step up in the pocket , drop a bomb on them , and we 'll thank them for rushing that way . " <p> When it 's time to run the ball , guards often have more responsibilities than their fellow linemen . A few teams , including Oakland , employ mostly zone blocking techniques , in which all of their mammoth linemen are responsible for whomever happens to be in front of them . Pittsburgh , on the other hand , has required its guards to move all over the field as part of its ground game since Chuck Noll was coach . So Faneca gets the chance to pull and " butt heads downfield , " as he puts it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running plays than tackles or centers . Makes sense , because they 're between those positions . On some plays , guards may double-team a defensive tackle with the center and then slide off to take on a linebacker . Or they may help on the end with the offensive tackle and then move upfield . The ability to work in concert with fellow linemen is developed through continuous communication , during practice and film sessions and particularly in game situations , when the live ammunition is flying . " It 's like a little discussion group out there before a play , " Shields says . <p> It 's a popular misconception that the center makes all the pre-snap line calls . Given today 's complex defensive fronts - and defenses ' ability to stem ( fake ) or change before the snap - no one person can do it . And in shotgun situations , the center often is looking back to gauge the snap . So everybody talks . <p> Brown uses the two-man defensive line New England featured last year in passing situations as an example of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five linebackers in an attempt to confuse opponents . Those lines capable of communicating properly were able to arrange the proper protection . " You knew what those guys were going to do , " Brown says . " Willie McGinest was going to rush the passer . So was Tedy Bruschi . You just had to get it right . " <p> When linemen spend enough time together , Shields says , the communication becomes nonverbal , almost primal , the better to keep it secret from defenders . " If you play with somebody for a while , you 'll hear them grunt or moan a little , and you 'll know what they 're thinking , " Shields says . It 's all about being part of a cohesive unit that does n't suffer many breakdowns . " There ca n't be any jealousy , " Stone says . " If somebody 's not going good , we all have to help out . " <p> Pre-snap situations are n't the only area in which guards must account for variables . Some must also adapt their weight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has played everywhere from 295 to 335 pounds . When the Bills used a lot of zone schemes , he bulked up . Last year , when Buffalo passed more often , he was closer to his lower limit . Though such fluctuations are not common , guards constantly are trying to find the right weight at which they can stay strong enough to thwart bull rushes while still remaining nimble . Faneca 's first line coach in Pittsburgh wanted him to play at 300 . He tried that for a year or two but realized he needed more weight . Now , he packs about 315 pounds onto his 6-5 frame . <p> And he continues his weekly battles in the middle , away from the spotlight . But there is hope . As more and more talented defensive tackles flood the league , offenses will need people to block them . Good people . In the guard 's perfect world , the inside warriors will attract the same attention - and salary - as their more celebrated neighbors , who must deal with speed rushers . Just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that - the growing supply of excellent defensive tackles will elevate guards ' status . If that day is coming , it 's coming slowly . <p> " Everybody sees the center with the ball and the tackles , who are at the socalled ' prestigious positions ' on the line and get more money and attention , " Faneca says . " We are lost in the mix some . The salary structure is getting better . But there are still a couple teams in the league where they say , ' Aw , we can get anybody to play guard . ' " <p> That 's just what Warren Sapp and his brethren want to hear . <p> " It 's paramount to know where your help is coming from , Ant if you know none is coming , you better sit inside and make sure you do n't get beat in that hole .
