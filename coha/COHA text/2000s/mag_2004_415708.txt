... And so do most married couples . Pick up some let's-get-along advice from this case study and our Redbook Marriage Institute expert 's wisdom . BY LAMBETH HOCHWALD // When it comes to in-laws , nearly every couple seems to have a story . Howard Falkow , 38 , a human-resources consultant , and Debbie Falkow , 35 , a stay-at-home mother , have struggled with a tricky in-law relationship since they married 14 years ago . But lately , the Falkows-who live in Ramsey , New Jersey , with their three children , Peter , 8 , Mitchell , 6 , and Robin , 1-have clashed with Howard 's parents over their grandparenting style . This in-law stress is now affecting Howard and Debbie 's marriage , and they 're eager to make changes . Young marrieds often face in-law friction , because families tend to have different personality dynamics or ways of doing things , says Jane Greer , Ph.D. , author of Gridlock : Finding the Courage to Move On in Love , Work , and Life and a Redbook Marriage Institute expert . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are n't on the same wavelength about how to deal with it , " she says , " and this disconnect is unhealthy for their relationship . " So Redbook turned to Greer to help resolve the Falkows ' dilemma-and similar ones you might be facing . THE PROBLEM " I do n't like the way my father-in-law acts around my children , " explains Debbie . " He says inappropriate things . For example , he recently made a crack about the film Problem Child , telling one of my sons , " Here 's a movie that 's all about you . ' Plus , I think my motherin-law is critical of our parenting style , and this affects how she acts toward our children . " Howard , for his part , feels stuck in the middle . While he agrees with Debbie 's view of the situation , he 's worried about losing his tie with his parents . " Debbie is putting a wedge between them and me . I do n't like how they handle our kids-my father has made many critical comments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize that I 'm not going to change them . " Recently , things came to a flash point , the couple says , when Howard 's father said more uncomplimentary things to Howard about one of their sons-in front of the child . In response , Howard and Debbie stormed out of his parents ' home . Howard 's father called to apologize to Howard a week later . But , Howard says , " although I want to spend time with my parents , I ca n't do so comfortably because Debbie is very upset . " Debbie wishes her father-in-law would apologize to her , too . THE BACK STORY When Debbie started dating Howard during college , she did n't expect she 'd one day have serious problems with his parents . " Back then , I spent lots of time with his mom , " Debbie recalls . " I even went to aerobics class with her . Things changed when we got engaged . She made me feel as though I was taking Howard from her . " During their first year of marriage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I did n't expect special treatment , but I believe that he did n't behave nicely toward me at all , " she says . " He 'd bark orders and yell for no reason . Nothing I did seemed to please him . " When Debbie got pregnant , she thought it would pull her closer to his parents . But she still felt like an outsider . " I 've always wanted to feel I 'm as close to my mother-in-law as her own daughters are , " says Debbie . " But his mom-and dad-seem increasingly impatient with the kids and with me . " Howard agrees that his parents are n't making things easy . " My mother is controlling . My father is critical of everyone , " he says . But beyond admitting that , he 's reluctant to stand up to his mom and dad , much to Debbie 's disappointment . THE EXPERT 'S ADVICE These highly charged in-law rifts are hard to mend , says Green So , to manage the situation , Howard and Debbie need to keep these strategies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , let go of idealized visions of relationships . Almost everyone enters marriage with some wishful thinking about making close connections with their in-laws . Debbie expected Howard 's family to embrace her unconditionally . Debbie also assumed that Howard 's parents would be wildly head over heels in love with their grandchildren , mirroring the close relationship she 's always enjoyed with her own grandparents . But fantasy time is over , says Greer . Instead of clinging to this fairy tale-and wishing for a relationship she does n't have-it 's time for Debbie to get real . " Recognize who your in-laws really are , " suggests Greer . " If an in-law is negative , accept that you ca n't change his behavior . But what you can do is change your reaction to his behavior . This is the key . " * Mend fences . Debbie and Howard need to make amends for walking out on Howard 's parents , and set up a visit to discuss the impasse . " Sometimes , if a situation is intolerable , walking away is the only way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But now you must walk back-steps that are n't always easy-and hammer out ground rules for the future relationship you 're trying to build with your in-laws . " * Present a united front . Debbie and Howard must go to his parents together , and speak in " we " and " our " statements . They can say : " We felt bad the last time we saw you and wound up walking out . We want to talk with you about it , and make sure it does n't happen again to us . " The more solid you are as a couple , the more prepared you 'll be to handle any criticisms that come your way , says Greer . Although Debbie wants Howard to be her knight in shining armor and leap to her rescue , it will be more meaningful if he calmly and strongly defends his family with statements like : " When you talk to our son like this , we find it distressing " and " It 's important to us that you focus on what our kids do right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statements , insisting their viewpoint is the only right one , acknowledge that there are different parenting styles . Say : " You 're entitled to disagree , but this is how we want to raise our children . We know you 're trying to help in your own way , but we will let you know if we need your help . " * Avoid tension-triggering scenarios . Next , Howard and Debbie need to temper situations that cause friction . They can limit their visits with his parents to an hour ( rather than an all-day get-together ) or arrange for meetings in public places-at a restaurant , on a picnic in a park , during a ball game-to decrease the likelihood that a situation could escalate out of control . For the time being , Greer advises , when the kids visit with his parents , Howard and Debbie should both be present . This will help ensure that his mother and father are respecting their parenting style . * Defuse negative comments . Help the criticizer hear how petty he or she sounds by politely turning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Debbie and Howard are told that their child should " act his age , " they can respond with , " He 's a child . He is acting his age . " This should be said gently , not accusingly . The content of the message is heard if it 's delivered without rancor . Add a smile . If told that their child should " be neater , " they can respond with , " He 's doing the best he can do . We are proud of our child . " The principle here is to practice thoughtfully responding to a situation rather than reacting to it . Together , consider writing out common scenarios that might come up and your possible responses to them . This paperwork , of course , is for your eyes only , but will help you see options as a couple . If these tactics fail to get results , then retreat , protecting your family unit and all it stands for . And finally , be open-minded . " Maybe Howard 's mother has a good parenting point that Debbie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mother-in-law does n't , or if Debbie firmly feels that she 's doing the right thing for her children , then Debbie must learn to not take it personally . Debbie and Howard are grownups . They 're not raising their children to please the in-laws . They do n't need their in-laws ' blessing or approval to be good parents .
