Right : The silhouette of a serpent appears on a Mayan pyramid on vernal and autumnal equinoxes. // Anthony Aveni takes the " road less traveled " to decipher the secrets of ancient cultures . Ancient ruins , like Rorschach inkblot tests , often reveal more about the beholder than they do about the objects themselves . Lines and drawings carved into a Peruvian desert a couple of thousand years ago inspired Erich von Daniken to suggest they served as runways for alien spaceships . This was the 1970s , and Anthony Aveni , then an astronomy professor at Colgate University in Hamilton , New York , was painstakingly searching for evidence of the truth . While von Daniken and others looked at drawings and photos to reach their otherworldly conclusions , Aveni took a research team out to the Pampa de Ingenio . There he discovered earth etchings that formed giant birds , spiders , monkeys , and more . He and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them up to eight miles long ) and more than 60 raylike hubs of lines .

Photograph Aveni stands before the 10th-century Caracol Observatory ( at top of stairs ) , which has windows facing Venus 's rising and setting points . Based on ancient texts and accounts from 16th-century Spanish priests , archaeoastronomers know that Venus was very important to Mayan culture . // In a recent issue of Archaeology magazine , Aveni concedes his theory is n't as dramatic as an extraterrestrial landing pad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he writes , " I marvel equally at the imagination of the people who have sought explanations for them . " Despite his lengthy research in Peru ( see " Stairways to the Stars : Skywatching in Three Great Ancient Cultures " - Astronomy , November 1997 ) , Aveni 's expertise lies in the Mayan civilization in Mexico , where he began his foray into archaeoastronomy . Colgate University had a January term during the late 1960s , and its emphasis was on experiential learning , not just collecting facts . " In those days , " he says , " you were supposed to do daring things , take students into the field to do things that had n't been done before . We came up with this crazy idea to go to Mexico to study the orientation of pyramids . We figured it was also a good way to get out of the cold climate of the northern United States . " We piled eight students into a van and got as far as the Monte Alban site in Mexico where there 's a five-sided pyramid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this monument was an indicator of sunset at solstice . Since we were there very close to solstice , we begged permission to stay at the site all night , watch the sunset , and so on . To make a long story short , we did , and the sun did n't . Instead of setting over here he jabbed his finger towards an imaginary point on the western horizon , it set over there . It was about 40 deg off . When we confronted the site guide about the discrepancy , he said , Well , I do n't know , that 's what the guide book says . ' " We really initiated the idea of going to the site and making measurements , " says Aveni . He and his students were the first to take a hard look at claims made about the pyramid . He says , " People had just accepted it . We started meeting archaeologists who said , You know , you measured this one - you should go to our site next year and measure that one . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 32 years . Since we no longer have a January term , I tell my students that my spring semester course will start three weeks early in Guatemala City and they should be there . They go and we do field work . " By training , Aveni is an astronomer , having received his Ph.D . from the University of Arizona . He worked as a spectroscopist with emphasis on galactic structure , T-Tauri stars , and star formation . Six years into his career at Colgate , he switched to archaeo astronomy . Photograph Archaeoastronomers use gestalt theory to assemble a picture of the past , piecing together clues from the alignment of buildings to the symbols on reliefs such as this one . // " That trip to Monte Alban opened an entirely new area to me because I had never been aware of what ancient people were doing , " he says . " When you teach astronomy , you 're naturally interested in where astronomy came from . " Now he holds a chair in astronomy and anthropology at Colgate . " Astronomers study stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at stars , " he says . Aveni defines archaeoastronomy as the practice of astronomy using both the written and unwritten record . He emphasizes 11 unwritten , " because in studying Old World astronomy such as that of Galileo or the Greeks , " We glean all our information from texts , and we do n't pay attention to the archaeological record , or the iconography , the sculpture . Archaeoastronomy combines all of these ways of understanding the sky , and it goes beyond the equations or written descriptions . " In the unwritten category , Aveni includes alignments of the windows or shafts of a building , the spatial relationship among pyramids , and many other design issues . He agrees that there 's another side to archaeoastronomy - the cultural aspect . " People talk about the lost culture of the Maya , ' but they 're not lost , " he says . " There are 29 Mayan dialects spoken by two and a half million people in the Mayan area . We can learn about their language , their mathematics , their world view , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aveni says that his students often worry that Mayans , Aztecs , and the Inca did n't know about the Earth and planets orbiting the sun . He tells them that given their backgrounds , those cultures would n't have cared about that question , which comes from ancient Greece . It 's in Aristotle 's political writing - not his physics - where the philosopher describes the organization of space , as well as of social classes , as orbs orbiting a center , says Aveni . " So , if we lived in ancient Greece , you and I would sit in a coffee shop and contemplate the hierarchical arrangement of culture according to this orbital model , " says Aveni . " And , it 's from that model that the Greeks took license to discuss the matter of how the heavens are arranged hierarchically . What 's the center and what 's not the center ? From that , Copernicus got his idea of the sun being the center , and from that Niels Bohr got his idea of the nucleus being the center of the atom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think about nature . You ca n't study nature without culture . " He adds , " Our way of understanding the world is not the only way . Nor is it even the preferred way . Nor does it even have any advantages over any other way of understanding the world . I think that the way one understands the world is tied to who they are , and that includes us . " Aveni would like to see archaeoastronomers become more skeptical with regards to certain claims at " archaeoastronomical " sites . He feels they would be more skeptical if they knew more about the culture in question , and that we should ask ourselves how a particular people were going to use the knowledge we think they were using . Using research at Stonehenge as an example , he says , " All this stuff about extremely precise lunar alignments and eclipse predictions - I do n't think it washes . I do n't think people who lived in the Bronze Age would care much about predicting eclipses . What 's the advantage to it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about having their sacred space lit night and day by the sun and the moon , in alternate roles rising and setting opposite each other ? Yes , I think that 's very likely . That 's an example of the kind of question archaeoastronomy should ask . I think alot of archaeoastronomy is about erecting cardboard ancestors of ourselves . " People do things to meet needs , he explains , so archaeoastronomers should be looking at what the needs of the culture were that caused them to do or create certain things . " Gerald Hawkins once said of Stonehenge something like , If I can see anything in these stones it must have been known to the ancients . I do n't agree with that . If I see anything in the stones , I do n't know that they knew it . I have to be able to demonstrate that they knew it . The only way I think we can do that is with statistics - we have to use statistics to show that these arrangements and alignments occur at a statistically significant level so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous to use contemporary knowledge when you do n't know for sure how much continuity there is in the culture . We like to think there 's continuity in culture because that would be cool , but we do n't know it . If we have evidence for it , we can use it . That 's why I like to work with Maya . You can make some hypotheses . On the other hand it 's difficult because you have to know about the writing . " Photograph Archaeologists are still unearthing ancient Mayan monuments , like this one to Kukulcan , the serpent god , in Chichen Itza , Mexico . Thousands of visitors crowd its base every March on the vernal equinox to watch a shadow-snake appear along the steep staircase . // Aveni does n't like to take a " scatter-gun " approach to interpreting a site . One of the reasons he went to Teotihuacan , where the great pyramids of Mexico reside , was to study carved petroglyphs in the shape of a double circle with a cross , resembling a target . These symbols @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the buildings . Earlier researchers believed that some of these markers could have functioned as architectural benchmarks to align the city . Aveni 's team set out to precisely measure the lay of the land , surveying the orientation of the city . " We found these markers everywhere . So , we had to map all of them , then we used statistics . " I do n't go into a site and say , There 's a nice pyramid , and there 's a bump on the horizon . That must be an alignment . If I find one that works I do n't say I discovered something , all the while ignoring the other 37 bumps on the horizon that do n't work with anything . I do n't do that . " A number of projects are on the horizon for Aveni , including work with epigraphers Victoria and Harvey Bricker at Tulane University , experts on Mayan writing . Part of their research will involve a set of pages in the Mayan Dresden Codex in which they 've discovered a Mars table . His most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " moderately well He finds it interesting to study Mayan mathematics and their axioms and principles in mathematics . " It 's challenging to try to reconcile what we see in the written works with what we see in the architecture , " he says . " By comparison , measuring alignments is easy . Maybe you can find a pattern . Maybe it 's true , maybe it 's not true , and that 's fun . But when you get the information from the culture , you have to try to mesh it with the science . " Married for 42 years , Aveni and his wife Lorraine have two children ( not astronomers , he assures me ) and a 13-year-old grandson who recently accompanied him into the field . While Aveni will take a semester away from Colgate in 2002 to work with the Brickers , he still loves his students and it shows .

I asked him what he hopes his students take with them upon leaving his class , and he responded , " Passion . Passion for anything .

" An Archaeoastronomer 's Tour of Mayan Country In the remains of the Mayan city Chich6n Itza , light and shadow mingle twice a year to reveal a serpent uncoiling down the stairs of the central pyramid . It happens at equinox , when our swiftly tilting planet passes through two points along its orbit of the sun . At those points , day and night balance each other perfectly , a yin and yang of light . The pyramid testifies to the importance of the sun and planets to the ancient Mayans . And it is still important today - many Mexicans , not to mention foreign tourists , visit the monument to the plumed serpent god Kukulcan for the annual unfurling of the snake . On March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fleeting mural along El Castillo , the pyramid 's Spanish name . ( The snake also forms on the balus-trades at autumnal equinox , but to lesser hoopla . ) The date of the Vernal equinox coincides with the birthday of Mexican hero Benito Juarez , celebrated officially by the Mexican government at Chichen Itza . In addition to birthday celebrants , people visit the site out of astronomical interest , amazed at the proposition that the builders of the pyramid could have aligned the building so perfectly to mark the new season . Many of the two million living Mayans come to keep the traditions of their culture alive . The shadowy snake almost perfectly unfurls on the stairs for a few days on either side of equinox . On March 23 , archaeoastronomer Anthony Aveni served as our guide to the ruins of Chichen Itza , paying special attention to those that used astronomical references . That day several hundred people turned out to witness the ephemeral phenomenon , despite the tropical downpour that had dampened our plans all day . We gathered before Kukulcan pyramid at 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun , without which the snake is not visible . We were not disappointed - the sky cleared almost magically just at the crucial moment . During the week of the equinox , no one is allowed to climb Kukulcan pyramid , so this time we watched from its base . But to get a good view of the building , the city , and the whole Yucatin peninsula , it 's really necessary to climb to the top . Each of its four sides holds 91 steps , and one more step gains admission to the temple . The total is 365 steps , matching the days of the solar year . Nine terraces separate the stairs into 18 sections , matching the Mayan month , and each of 52 panels above the terraces marks a year , adding up to the equivalent of a Mayan century . The ascent is steep , though nowhere near as precipitous as it seems on the way down , when many people cling to centrally located chains for support . Chicken Itza began as a farming village in about 500 A.D. However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central pyramid , was built later , during the post  --  classic Mayan period . The pyramid 's external walls are about 1,000 years old , though underneath the most recent construction reside smaller , older pyramids , each one built around the other by a subsequent ruler . Pyramids of the classic period ( 200-950 A.D. ) , like the ones at Tikal in Guatemala , are steeper still , and at Tikal 's tallest and steepest central pyramid , it is too steep to climb . From the temple level near the top of Kukulcan , you can survey nearly all the ruins of Chichen Itza . You can see the Observatory , the Temple of the Warriors , the group of a thousand columns , the Venus Platform , the largest Mayan ball court in Mesoamerica , and the nunnery . Trees and vines around the buildings create a quilt in shades of green that expands out to the end of visibility . The land is flat in every direction . Where there are small rises in the landscape , it seems another as-yet-unexamined temple resides , buried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site in all of the Yucatan , the city that once ruled even Chichen Itza , has revealed itself only recently . ) Anthony Aveni spends almost every vernal equinox here as a guest of Royal Olympic cruises , for whom he lectures on the connections between people and the sky . He is one of three archaeologists every year who tell visitors about Mayan culture as they cruise through the Caribbean . On this trip to Chichen Itza , he has pointed out the Venus Platform , the perfectly aligned Observatory , and dozens of the hieroglyphs throughout the ruins that celebrate the sun , Venus , and other planets . On this trip , Aveni is accompanied by Rebecca Storey , a University of Houston physical anthropologist , who studies human bones from pre-Columbian civilizations and has supervised the study of 600 skeletons excavated at Copan in Honduras . ( She tells us that the human remains found in so many Mayan cenotes , or sacred wells , were not only young , female virgins , as visitors are often told , but also included men and people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleague at the university , Randolph J. Widmer , is along to discuss a broad range of research interests , including the relationship between the Mayan builders and the environment . In 2002 Royal Olympic offered a ten-day cruise that began with a tour of Chicken Itza at vernal equinox . Along the way , outings are offered to take visitors to many other Mayan ruins , including Tikal and Quirigua in Guatemala , Copan in Honduras , and Tulum and Coba in Mexico . Each of these Mayan sites provides intriguing details that link the culture with the sky . In 2003 , the cruise line plans a seven-day trip with fewer stops . Alternatively , you may want to visit these ruins at your own pace , without a tour . Their aesthetic appeal combined with the ingenuity of the builders invite introspection and inspire awe .
