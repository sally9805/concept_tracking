Prologue // How did he know he would not die ? " a Frenchman asked of the first runner to // break the four-minute mile . Half a century ago the ambition to achieve that // goal equaled scaling Everest or sailing alone around the world . Most people // considered running four laps of the track in four minutes to be beyond the // limits of human speed . It was foolhardy and possibly dangerous to attempt . // Some thought that rather than a lifetime of glory , honor , and fortune , a hearse // would be waiting for the first person to accomplish the feat . // The four-minute mile : this was the barrier , both physical and // psychological , that begged to be broken . The number had a certain // mathematical elegance . As one writer explained , the figure " seemed so // perfectly round  --  four laps , four quarter miles , four-point-oh-oh minutes  --  that // it seemed God himself had established it as man " s limit . " Under four // minutes  --  the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " s Valhalla . For decades the best middle-distance runners had tried and // failed . They had come to within two seconds , but that was as close as they // were able to get . Attempt after spirited attempt had proved futile . Each effort // was like a stone added to a wall that looked increasingly impossible to // breach . // But the four-minute mile had a fascination beyond its // mathematical roundness and assumed impossibility . Running the mile was // an art form in itself . The distance  --  unlike the 100-yard sprint or the // marathon  --  required a balance of speed and stamina . The person to break // that barrier would have to be fast , diligently trained , and supremely aware of // his body so that he would cross the finish line just at the point of complete // exhaustion . Further , the four-minute mile had to be won alone . There could // be no teammates to blame , no coach during halftime to inspire a comeback . // One might hide behind the excuses of cold weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or jostling competition , but ultimately these obstacles had to be defied . // Winning a footrace , particularly one waged against the clock , was ultimately // a battle with oneself , over oneself . // In August 1952 the battle commenced . Three young men in their // early twenties set out to be the first to break the barrier . Born to run fast , // Wes Santee , the " Dizzy Dean of the Cinders , " was a natural athlete and the // son of a Kansas ranch hand . He amazed crowds with his running feats , // basked in the publicity , and was the first to announce his intention of running // the mile in four minutes . " He just flat believed he was better than anybody // else , " said one sportswriter . Few knew that running was his escape from a // brutal childhood . // Then there was John Landy , the Australian who trained harder // than anyone else and had the weight of a nation " s expectations on his // shoulders . The mile for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I " d rather lose a 3:58 mile than win one in 4:10 . " Landy ran night // and day , across fields , through woods , up sand dunes , along the beach in // knee-deep surf . Running revealed to him a discipline he never knew he had . // And finally there was Roger Bannister , the English medical // student who epitomized the ideal of the amateur athlete in a world being // overrun by professionals and the commercialization of sport . For Bannister // the four-minute mile was " a challenge of the human spirit , " but one to be // realized with a calculated plan . It required scientific experiments , the wisdom // of a man who knew great suffering , and a magnificent finishing kick . // All three runners endured thousands of hours of training to shape // their bodies and minds . They ran more miles in a year than many of us walk // in a lifetime . They spent a large part of their youth struggling for breath . They // trained week after week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second , // maybe two , during a mile race  --  the time it takes to snap one " s fingers and // register the sound . There were sleepless nights and training sessions in rain , // sleet , snow , and scorching heat . There were times when they wanted to go // out for a beer or a date yet knew they couldn " t . They understood that life was // somehow different for them , that idle happiness eluded them . If they weren " t // training or racing or gathering the will required for these efforts , they were // trying not to think about training and racing at all . // In 1953 and 1954 , as Santee , Landy , and Bannister attacked the // four-minute barrier , getting closer with every passing month , their stories // were splashed across the front pages of newspapers around the world , // alongside headlines about the Korean War , Queen Elizabeth " s coronation , // and Edmund Hillary " s climb toward the world " s rooftop . Their performances // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derbies , rugby // matches , football games , and golf majors . Ben Hogan , Rocky Marciano , // Willie Mays , Bill Tilden , and Native Dancer were often in the shadows of the // three runners , whose achievements attracted media attention to track and // field that has never been equaled since . For weeks in advance of every race // the headlines heralded an impending break in the barrier : " Landy Likely to // Achieve Impossible ! " ; " Bannister Gets Chance of 4-Minute Mile ! " ; " Santee // Admits Getting Closer to Phantom Mile . " Articles dissected track conditions // and the latest weather forecasts . Millions around the world followed every // attempt . When each runner failed  --  and there were many failures  --  he was // criticized for coming up short , for not having what it took . Each such episode // only motivated the others to try harder . // They fought on , reluctant heroes whose ambition was fueled by a // desire to achieve the goal and to be the best . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men only Santee enjoyed the publicity , and that proved to be // more of a burden than an advantage . As for riches , financial reward was // hardly a factor  --  they were all amateurs . They had to scrape around for // pocket change , relying on their hosts at races for decent room and board . // The prize for winning a meet was usually a watch or a small trophy . At that // time , the dawn of television , amateur sport was beginning to lose its // innocence to the new spirit of " win at any cost , " but these three strove only // for the sake of the attempt . The reward was in the effort . // After four soul-crushing laps around the track , one of the three // finally breasted the tape in 3:59.4 , but the race did not end there . The barrier // was broken , and a media maelstrom descended on the victor , yet the // ultimate question remained : who would be the best when they toed the // starting line together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a race fought not against the // clock but against one another . It was won with a terrific burst around the final // bend in front of an audience spanning the globe . // If sport , as a chronicler of this battle once said , is a " tapestry of alternating // triumph and tragedy , " then the first thread of this story begins with tragedy . It // occurred in a race 120 yards short of a mile at the 1,500- meter Olympic final // in Helsinki , Finland , almost two years to the day before the greatest of // triumphs . //
