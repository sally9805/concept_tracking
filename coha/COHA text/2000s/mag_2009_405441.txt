Viking 's ritzy new smoker , plus a little gadget to monitor your grub , lets you achieve perfection . It 's been a while since I used state-of-the-art technology to harass a neighbor . Readers of this column might recall how last fall , when I was locked in a race to build a better man cave than my friend 's across the street , I abused my position as a consumer-electronics writer so I could invite my buddy Dorfman to come check out my magnificent new 65-in. laser-powered HDTV from Mitsubishi . Victory was mine , at least for the 15 days until I had to give the TV back . But this spring , when I heard that an upcoming barbecue competition on our block would pit me against Stock ( Dorfman 's next-door neighbor ) , I quailed . Stock is a barbecue bully . During the last cook-off , he planked a salmon that was epic -- and he never stopped gloating about it . Now , with the Great Chicken Grill-Off only weeks away , he was mincing about with a plan to kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Help arrived in an e-mail from the Viking Range Corp. : Would I like to try its new 30-in. gravity-feed smoker ? Faster than you can say baby back ribs , I drove down to a Viking distributor in Hayward , Calif. , where a fellow named Mike Love gave me a quick demo of the $3,000 cooker . Most smokers I 've used look like something from The Beverly Hillbillies . The Viking smoker is a sleek , 375-lb. ( 170 kg ) stainless-steel vault built to resemble a high-end refrigerator . A cute little chimney vents smoke from the middle . The " gravity feed , " Love pointed out , is nothing more than a long chute . It works much like a cat-food dispenser ; you fill it with charcoal and smoke woods , which drop down as the lower stuff burns out , so you can set your temperature at a nice 250F ( about 120C ) and walk away for 12 hours . Hillbilly-type smokers require a lot more tending . As if the cooker was n't cool enough , Love handed me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said of the DigiQ II ( $260 from thebbqguru.com ) . With a tiny fan and two temperature probes -- one for inside the pit and one for inside your food -- the DigiQ ensures stable heat by using the fan to stoke the embers . It also sounds an alarm when your meat 's cooked . Stock was a dead man . And he did n't even know it yet . Over the next 10 days , I smoked chickens , ducks , brisket , pheasant and , most delectable of all , ribs . I had lungs like a coal miner 's but continued to smoke anything I could find . I almost threw my wife 's little dog in there . On the day of the competition , my neighbors arrived with their chickens . Stock brought something he called " Chicken Salad in the Style of Zuni Caf . " I took him out back and , with a flourish , unlatched the smoker door . Stock looked stricken . Then he brightened as I pulled out my entre . " Ribs ? " he snorted . They would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , for these were the best ribs ever . Stock has n't mentioned his salmon since .
