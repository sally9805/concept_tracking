Chapter One Chapter the First . In which a damsel is discovered in a most compromising position . August 25th , 1882 , 9:00 pm It had been a particularly sweltering summer in New York City , the hottest summer on record ( and , not coincidentally , the first summer on record ) . By all accounts this evening promised to be yet another in the long progression of dog days that oozed like a piece of soft , runny brie served with a hunk of moldy French bread and washed down with a mug of room-temperature Clamato . Each day melting into the next with an excruciatingly , sluggishly slow excruciating monotony . The Santa Ana wind hissed as it blew through the narrow , rough-hewn , cobblestone , gaslit , historically accurate streets , and then it giggled down Fifth Avenue , baking the leaves on the mango and banana trees lining the fashionable boulevard into crisp , brittle parchment . Indeed , the summer of 1882 was nearly as tedious as my first paragraph has been , and I thank you for your patience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newly built concrete-and-steel Flatiron Building , named for its innovative shape ( and coincidentally after its insane architect , Jos Emmanuel Flitarron ) . It was the tallest building in Manhattan in 1882 , though within a year it would be dwarfed by the Pan Am Building , which was already well under way . The street was strewn with paper streamers , confetti , shredded balloons , and discarded wooden legs . Sanitation workers ran around like madmen , heads upturned , arms flailing , chasing the last of the floating feathers that hovered like small ghosts , refusing to drift within arm 's reach . The feathers were castoffs from the annual Mummer 's Day parade , which had ended only an hour before . Occasionally two sanitation workers would run into each other and a vicious slap fight would ensue . A block east , in a nondescript brownstone , the killer put the final touches on a letter addressed to the Evening Post . He licked a stamp commemorating Thomas Edison 's triumphant electrocution of Jumbo the Giant Elephant , sealed the envelope with a wax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and placed the correspondence on top of his stack of outgoing taunting mail . He donned his black overcoat and top hat , grabbed the carpetbag in which he carried his instruments of death-as well as his workout clothes for later-and snuffed out the candle . ( Whale oil prices had skyrocketed ever since the sinking of the Pequod , and he had n't paid his bill in months . ) Then , with a spring in his step and a song in his heart , he headed out into the dark and steamy night . Across town , in the " unfortunates ' district , " there was a ramshackle hovel with nothing more than a bed , a woodstove , and a framed tintype depicting a cat hanging by its paws from an iron rod . The caption read , " I Most Humbly Request That You Hang in There , Baby , " a bit of inspiration for the occupant , who sorely needed it . She was a broken-down prostitute by the name of Sally " Old Toothless Sally " Jenkins , and she readied herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn-out boots , shifting her heavy skirt so that it faced the right direction , and dousing her underarms with turpentine . She caught her reflection in the mirror and cackled , " Well now , ai n't you a pretty one ! " Her cackle was quickly overtaken by a wet coughing fit . The gross hacking seemed to last forever . Neighbors pounded on the walls . Finally , Sally expelled a huge wad of phlegm that shot from her lungs and blew across the room like a cannonball , landing with a plop in a pan of simmering porridge atop her stove . " Oh bother , " she said , lighting the end of a half-smoked cigar , " I got phlegm in me porridge . " And with that she collapsed back onto her bed . * * * At around nine o'clock , Broadway filled with theater patrons stepping out at intermission for a breath of stale air . In the poverty-stricken neighborhoods , indigent children opened fire hydrants and splashed about in the filthy gutters , contracting cholera , while uptown the more posh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trumps sipped their mint juleps , made fun of poor people , and frolicked on their private beaches along the East River , also contracting cholera . On this night Mark Twain twirled his rope at Lincoln Center , Houdini performed his straitjacket trick at Avery Fisher Hall , and John Merrick , the Elephant Man , did his song and dance routine for a handful of potheads at the band shell in Central Park . All the rummeries and brothels were overflowing , and the restaurants were filled to the brim . At Delmonico 's , Mayor Teddy Roosevelt sat finishing his boiled cabbage and hind-quarters pie . His guest for the evening was Caleb Spencer , chief of police for the NCNYPD . The two were celebrating the arrest , earlier in the day , of Dandy Dan , the Water Man . For months now , he had terrified young couples in Central Park . Whilst a romantic tryst was under way , the culprit would hide in the bushes , growling and gnashing his teeth . When the moment was right , he would spring out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great force on the young lady 's fine evening frock . Spencer had apprehended the felon his way . Not trusting the officious Detective Thomas Byrnes and his roundsmen with such a high-profile case , he had gone undercover , alone . He disguised himself as both a man and a woman . It was an elaborate costume , but it worked : a man in a tuxedo on one side , a woman in a ball gown on the other . When he twirled rapidly about , you 'd swear he was a pair of young lovers doing a steamy , down-and-dirty tango . ( Well , maybe you would n't swear , but it was enough to fool a man who spent the better part of the day hiding in the bushes . ) It also displayed a bit of creative thinking on Caleb 's part-something of which Detective Byrnes was incapable . Byrnes and Spencer had endured the police academy 's rigorous training together , but their strained and often competitive relationship had only further deteriorated after Caleb 's quick rise within the department . He was now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roosevelt tapped a glass with a spoon . " I say , my good man , tell me exactly how you managed to corner the dastardly malefactor ! I always love a good story . " " Well , " Caleb began , " I had just drawn my ' lovely partner ' toward me , when I saw this gentleman on his hands and knees , barking . I thought to myself , ' Now , that is highly unusu- ' " " Bully ! " interrupted Roosevelt . Caleb sighed . The mayor loved a good story , but only if it was his own . " My dear Mr. Spencer , have I ever told you about the time I slept in a hollowed-out four-day-old water buffalo carcass ? " " Yes , I believe that you have , Mayor , several times in fact , but as I have never paid any attention , you may proceed as if you have not . " " Jolly good then ! " And with that , the jovial mayor launched into another boring story of his exploits . Caleb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's perfectly round head . Insulting Roosevelt without the mayor 's realizing it had become a game for Spencer 's own private amusement . ( Spencer had always been a bit of a loner , and he enjoyed nothing more than playing with himself . ) At thirty-three , he was already a seasoned veteran of the force . Having joined when he was a mere five years of age-to work the badge-polishing machine-he rose quickly within the ranks , making lieutenant by the time he was six . His hard-nosed , no-nonsense , **69;515;TOOLONG approach had impressed the older , fatter , and even more incontinent coppers . Upon his appointment as chief , the young crime-fighter garnered a reputation not only for being a good cop , but also , according to an editorial in the Evening Post : ... for having looks and appeal so devastatingly dashing as to make any proper woman of childbearing age swoon with delight at visions of the strapping young police chief , buck naked except for a cowboy hat , dancing in her head . However , much had changed since those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dating the Evening Post 's star reporter , but the times had also been hard on him . Three short years presiding over the most corrupt , crime-ridden city in the world had aged him . His hairline had begun to recede , and what remained was going quickly gray . To make matters worse , Roosevelt had ambushed him at the scene of Dandy Dan 's arrest and insisted that he come to dinner , and Spencer had had no time to change out of his disguise . So there he sat , wearied by the night 's ordeals and the mayor 's long-winded diatribes , with half a blond wig hanging precariously askew , still bedecked in the now filthy tuxedo and torn ball gown , and scented , faintly , with the pungent effluvium of wine . He looked less like a dashing police chief and more like Bette Davis in Hush ... Hush , Sweet Charlotte after being flattened by a steamroller . " Oh my , look at the time , " he announced , returning his pocket watch to the shiny sequined purse that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you for a lovely evening . Your self-indulgent anecdotes were both egocentric on the one hand , and long-winded and pointless on the other , but now I must be on my way . " " Let 's us two have a toast ! " the mayor roared , lifting his goblet of Umbria Vittiono ' 54 , a robust merlot aged with a fine mix of red grapes from the Napa Valley and the essence of pure heroin ( which was perfectly legal in the Age of Innocence , and was referred to as " God 's Own Medicine " ) . Caleb was uncomfortable with congratulations of any kind , and he knew that the toast would be in his honor . So , to get the embarrassment over with , he quickly raised his flaming dry martini , laced with uncut cocaine and liquid arsenic ( both also perfectly legal , and known as " God 's Own Snuff " and " God 's Own Rat Poison , " respectively ) . " In all my years as mayor , I 've been privileged to witness several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Okay , here it comes , thought Caleb . " But nothing that could compare with what I faced when leading a handful of ragtag , battle-weary soldiers on that fateful charge up the great San Juan Hill . " " The Spanish-American War does n't even happen until 1898 , " Caleb snapped . " If you are going to force me to endure your stories , at least get your facts straight . " Roosevelt looked hurt . " Are you calling me a liar , Mr. Spencer ? " Caleb sighed . The worst part of his job was dealing with the sensitive emotions of the city 's rich and powerful . Still , he preferred Roosevelt , who was merely pompous , to some of the more nefarious types he had to deal with , like J. P. Morgan , the Rockefellers , or the worst of them all , William " Boss " Tweed . He had dined with Boss Tweed on more than one occasion , and he had always left the meal feeling quite dirty all over . Roosevelt , for all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreaded Tammany Machine . " Not at all , Mayor . Please , continue . " " There I was atop my trusty steed Bully Boy , bugle in one hand and saber outstretched in the other . All around us-in every direction-bloodthirsty Indians as far as the eye could see ... " If this was going to end in a toast to Caleb , it was going to take a while . He sneaked another look at his timepiece . It was now 9:23 . The hands blurred and dissolved as Caleb 's eyes glazed over . The hypnotic , rhythmic pounding of Roosevelt 's garbled voice droned on and on and on . * * * On Tenth Avenue , Old Toothless Sally had finally gotten it together and was out hawking her goods . " Hello , gov'nor . Care for a quick bibble in the old bobble ? " A quick bibble in the old bobble cost an even sixpence , while a " wet waggle " cost a ha'penny or two . " A fish in a dish , with tartar sauce on the side " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " dilly-wonker " or a " triple wraparound digger , " that was extra , and Sally always made it clear up front that she was n't into anything weird . At approximately 9:20 , a morbidly obese albino man coming out of the original Original Ray 's Pizzeria on Eleventh Avenue witnessed Sally waddling up Eighth Street . He later said that she belched , picked something out of her ear , hawked up a loogie " of unbelievable size , " and then turned onto Ninth , heading east . It was the last time she would be seen alive , for at that exact moment , the killer walked through the Five Points district of lower Manhattan . He walked warily ; even for him , this neighborhood was dangerous . It was populated by large street gangs with unusual names like the Flapjacks , the Garlic Knots , the Venti Caffe Lattes , and the Toasted Bialys with a Schmeer . Often these packs would engage in ultraviolent , riotous brawls that could last the whole night long and would inevitably end with at least one gang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the killer was lucky . It was all quiet in the Five Points . He made his way up Broadway , where he paused to buy a cup of mayonnaise from a street vendor . In 1882 a man named Hellmann had just invented this oil-and-egg delight , but he was n't yet sure how to market it . He started with street carts , selling it like ice cream . New Yorkers were so crazy about the new treat that they were more than content , at present , to eat it from a cup with a spoon , or perhaps on a sugar cone with chocolate sprinkles . After finishing his mayo , the killer picked up his pace . The need to murder , maim , and mutilate began to boil up in his veins . He quickly strode the three blocks to Herald Square , where he hoisted up his woolen trousers and waded through the waist-high manure . Back then there were no cars , and the buggy horses left behind copious amounts of waste . Herald Square 's bowl-shaped topography ( it was actually below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city 's excrement , as well as most of the city 's missing persons . He was now just one block away from the history books , and ahead , at about ten yards and closing , Old Toothless Sally Jenkins was just one high-pitched cackle away from becoming the first unfortunate victim of Jack the Jolly Thwacker. * * * " ... and that 's when I decided that the elephant 's foot would make a bully coffee table ! " Roosevelt exploded with a boisterous laugh that shook Caleb back to reality . " So here 's to me , " bellowed Teddy . " Long may I live . Chin chin , my good friend ! " Caleb and the mayor clinked glasses . " I 'll second that , gentlemen , " said a woman 's voice . " Well , by golly almighty ! Look what the cat dragged in ! " Roosevelt bellowed . He stood up , and the tablecloth , tucked into his trousers , pulled up with him , emptying the contents of their glasses into Caleb 's lap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bother to sigh , but merely dabbed at his wet crotch with a handkerchief . " Why , if it is n't the charming Elisabeth Smith , columnist par excellence for the Evening Post , " Roosevelt schmoozed while taking her hand . She was the last person Caleb wanted to see , especially in his current condition . " Oh , Mr. Mayor , you 're much too kind . " " On the contrary , miss , I am not kind at all . But I am as strong as a bull moose and you may use me to the limit ! " With that the mayor clicked his heels and kissed Elisabeth 's hand . " I have no idea what that means , " she said , still smiling . " But I thought you were on assignment somewhere in Japan , " said Roosevelt . " Close ; Egypt , to be precise . I was following the exploits of Mr. Howard Carter and Lord Carnarvon . They were excavating old houses belonging to the slaves who built Ramses the Sixth 's tomb . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they could n't seem to budge . They claimed that something wonderful was on the other side , but by then I was simply fed up with all the sand and all the dirt and grit . It was finding its way into- " She paused , as if looking for the right words . " Every orifice that I have . " She paused again , frowning , as if those were n't the right words at all . " I mean , I just had to get back home , and so here I am . " " And we 're all the better for it , " cooed the mayor . " Tell me , did Mr. Carter and Lord Carnarvon ever get the door open ? " " Beats me . Who 's the trannie ? " Elisabeth asked , referring to Caleb . " My apologies . Police Chief Spencer , may I introduce Miss Elisabeth Smith . " Caleb reluctantly stood , staring forlornly at his crotch . " Hello , Liz , " he muttered . ( Continues ... )    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
