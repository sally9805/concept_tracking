Say you 're a college sophomore and you 've been assigned to write a thesis on the art of comedy . Like many an industrious student in the information age , you go to the Internet and purchase one . On a website that sells dissertations and theses , you comb through papers on Moliere , Chaucer and Shakespeare until you find one you like : " Adam Sandler 's Big Daddy : Utopian Qualities and Social Propaganda , " a bargain at just under $200 . <P> It begins , " The impracticality of Utopian qualities as they exist in the movie Big Daddy is a decidedly obvious deduction ... Big Daddy speaks to the grave deficit in man 's quest to define human happiness . " It goes on for 12 more pages , using some mighty fancy words to describe the cultural resonance of Sandler 's 1999 hit , in which he befriends a little boy and shows the kid how to urinate against a wall . <P> Critics might want to start downloading because with Punch-Drunk Love ( see review ) , the cultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In his new movie , Sandler plays a plunger salesman who dreams of escaping his banal existence via frequent-flyer miles . As far as romantic comedies go , it 's very strange , which is what you would expect from director Paul Thomas Anderson of Magnolia and Boogie Nights . What you do n't expect is an art film starring Sandler , whose lowbrow comedies have earned nearly $400 million since 1998 and have made him an idol of teenage boys , a cult figure on college campuses and a punch line for dismissive film critics . Punch-Drunk Love  --  for which Anderson received a best-director award at Cannes  --  is making the dumb-and-dumber Sandler persona seem smart and smarter . <P> The story of comic actors doing serious turns is as old as Buster Keaton and as contemporary as Jim Carrey . But , in fact , Sandler , like the greatest of Hollywood stars , has n't really changed at all . Rather , Hollywood has adapted to him . Sandler , 36 , is not the kind of actor who " stretches . " Like Humphrey Bogart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what his fans pay money to see . Sandler 's shrewd move is to keep playing Adam Sandler and get a thoughtful movie made around him . <P> Like the Cajun numskull in 1998 's The Waterboy , Sandler 's character in Punch-Drunk Love , Barry Egan , is prone to violence but hates himself for it . Like the rich slacker who returns to elementary school as an adult in 1995 's Billy Madison , Egan is ultimately redeemed by the unwarranted love of a woman ( Emily Watson ) . Some will say Sandler has developed an edge  --  indeed , the R-rated Punch-Drunk Love is much darker than , say , The Wedding Singer  --  but Sandler has always had a dark side . It has been relegated to his successful , warning-labeled comedy albums . Now , as his fans get older , he 's bringing his own more mature side to the screen . <P> Sandler 's comic gift is that he can make a weirdo like Egan sympathetic without being sentimental . He never resorts to the emotional tics so beloved by comedians in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his characters , Sandler himself seems to lack the underlying rage that fuels other comics ' work . Says Lorne Michaels , who was Sandler 's boss on Saturday Night Live : " There 's something that 's essentially optimistic about him . He 's one of the few people I know who 's not embarrassed about doing comedy . He think it 's a high goal . "
