MONDAY , AUGUST 31-7:02 P.M. EST-CIA HEADQUARTERS , LANGLEY , VIRGINIA <p> It was going to be bloody , but it could be done , if they moved fast . <p> All eyes in the CIA 's Global Operations Center turned to Danny Tracker . Once the deputy director of operations , Tracker , forty-six , was the newly installed director of the Central Intelligence Agency . Only he could authorize the Delta Force commander on the ground to carry out this strike , and it was he alone who would have to answer for his decision to the president , to a myriad of congressional oversight committees , and to his colleagues throughout the Byzantine world of U.S. intelligence . <p> The Agency had been hunting this " high-priority target " for months . Tracker watched as live video images of their prey streamed in from a Predator drone hovering-unheard , unseen-a mile above an abandoned warehouse outside of Sanaa , the capital of Yemen , where their target now entered , surrounded by scores of heavily armed bodyguards . <p> " How far away are they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he surveyed the feeds coming in on five enormous plasma TV screens on the wall before him . <p> " Both Delta teams are at least twenty minutes out , sir . " <p> Tracker winced . Twenty minutes was an eternity in his business . They had to take this guy down fast . Umberto Milano , after all , was the head of operations for the Legion , one of the most feared terrorist organizations on the planet . <p> Tracker flipped through the file in his hands , the one stamped " CLASSIFIED-EYES ONLY " in red . Only forty , Milano , the Sicilianborn son of Marxist radicals , had already served seven years ' hard time for blowing up two banks in Rome and one in Florence . Converted to Islam in prison . Escaped with two fellow inmates in 2000 . Fled to Afghanistan . Trained with bin Laden . Returned to Europe just before 9/11 . Joined the Legion , a loosely affiliated European arm of Al-Qaeda . Planned the Madrid train bombings in 2004 . Responsible for at least eight other bombings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> After the demise of Al-Qaeda , Milano provided financial and logistical assistance to the Al-Nakbah terror network run by Yuri Gogolov and Mohammed Jibril . What 's more , the Agency had some evidence-circumstantial but compelling-that Milano had masterminded the suicide bombing at the Willard InterContinental in D.C. the previous January . <p> Tracker had no doubt the Legion was planning something far deadlier , but at the moment , he had no idea what . Milano had eluded the Agency for years , operating in the shadows and off the grid . They had no idea where he lived . They had very little idea who his contacts and associates were . All they had were occasional bits and pieces of phone and e-mail intercepts ; this was the first time they 'd ever been able to spot and track him in real time . They needed to take him down . They needed to make him talk . They needed to extract every last bit of information they could . And they needed to do it now . <p> " Yesterday 's tip on Milano 's movements-do we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " No , sir , " the watch officer said . <p> " But you 're absolutely certain it 's him in that warehouse ? " <p> " Yes , sir , I am . " <p> Tracker turned to two senior intelligence analysts , each of whom had spent much of his career focused on the Legion . <p> " Do you guys concur ? " <p> " I do , sir , " one said . <p> " No question , " the other said . " That 's Milano , all right . And with all due respect , sir , we need to take him before it 's too late . " <p> Tracker turned back to the senior watch commander and asked , " Do the Delta teams have everything they need to bring this guy in ? " <p> But the commander was no longer listening to the conversation . His eye had suddenly been drawn back to the live feed coming in from the Predator . <p> Now Tracker looked there too . " You 've got to be kidding me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> No one said a word . The Predator feed said it all . A dozen armed men were clearly exiting the warehouse and taking up positions around the third vehicle in a line of five black SUVs . <p> " How much longer until Delta is on scene ? " Tracker asked . <p> " They 're still ten minutes out , sir . " <p> Tracker glanced at his watch . They did n't have ten minutes . <p> President James " Mac " MacPherson was en route to Los Angeles . Tracker knew he 'd love nothing more than to be able to point to a new success in the War on Terror during his prime-time speech that night at the Republican National Convention . Giving the president the ability to announce a major CIA coup to a global audience could n't hurt his Agency 's tattered image , or his own career . <p> The country was deeply divided over the future . The rhetoric of the campaign could not have been hotter . Both major parties were locked in a knock-down , drag-out battle over who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MacPherson had served his eight years and could n't serve again . The latest polls showed his anointed successor in a dead heat with the Democratic challenger . Perhaps an operation like this could help tip the balance , even a little , Tracker thought . Perhaps in a race this close , even a little boost might be all that was needed . <p> " Sir , we need a decision , " the senior watch commander pressed . <p> Tracker felt his pulse racing . He had only two options . He could let Milano leave the warehouse , use the Predator to follow him to his next location , and pray Delta could move against him later that day or the next . Or he could forfeit the possibility-slim though it was-of bringing Milano in alive by ordering the Predator to fire two Hellfire missiles into the warehouse and parking lot , killing everyone and destroying everything inside and out . <p> " We 're out of time , sir . What do you want to do ? " <p> Tracker hesitated . What was more valuable-the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the worldwide headlines Milano 's death could give them now ? He stared at video feed and cursed again . Sometimes technology was n't enough . <p> " Take him out , " Tracker said at last . " Take them all out . " <p> All eyes turned to the center video screen , and as the senior watch commander relayed the orders to the Predator controllers in the field , everyone in the Global Operations Center seemed to hold their collective breath . No one said a word , but Danny Tracker was sure they were all thinking what he was . Was he doing the right thing ? How much actionable intelligence was he about to sacrifice ? What exactly would the president say when he heard the news ? Was there another way ? <p> But it was too late now . <p> Suddenly they could see the contrails of two laser-guided AGM-114 Hellfire missiles streaking toward the earth below . One hit the center of the warehouse . The other hit the center vehicle in the convoy . Two enormous explosions filled the screen with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the wreckage . Then came grisly , full-color images of a blazing building , five burning vehicles , and body parts strewn about as far as the eye could see . <p> The ops center erupted in cheers , but Tracker began pacing . He could n't celebrate . Not yet . Not until they had all that they 'd come for . <p> He stared at the Predator feed and the digital clock on the far wall and felt the acid chewing through the walls of his stomach . He clenched his teeth as two vans pulled onto the scene . Eight Delta operators , all heavily armed and clad in Kevlar and black masks , set up a secure perimeter . Four more headed straight into the inferno . It was their job to find Milano , confirm his remains , and secure any evidence they might find on or around him , evidence that could-if they were lucky-give them some idea of what the Legion was planning next . But they were quickly running out of time . Whatever did n't burn or melt , Tracker knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in less than ten minutes , and their best hope for protecting against the next attack would be lost forever . <p> Chapter Two 2:41 A.M.-A REFUGEE CAMP IN NORTHERN JORDAN <p> Jon Bennett had no idea that U.S. forces were on the move . <p> He had no inkling of the horrifying plot they were about to uncover in the Yemeni capital . Nor did he care . Fourteen hundred miles away , in a crowded , disease-infested refugee camp in northern Jordan , just minutes from the Syrian border , a wave of panic gripped his body as he held his wife in his arms and begged her to hang on until help arrived . <p> " Erin , talk to me . Look at me , sweetheart . Please . " <p> But Erin did not respond . Her breathing was shallow . Her pulse was weak . Bennett yelled for a doctor , but no one came . Again and again he cried out into the scorching August night-thick with the stench of sweat and death-but amid the grotesque cacophony of the masses , no one even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was racing . It was n't possible . He could n't be losing her . They had been married less than eight months . <p> He had no idea what was wrong , but he could n't wait any longer . He had to find a doctor , a nurse , a soldier , someone-anyone-who could help . Still , he did n't dare leave Erin alone . What if he took too long ? What if he came back and it was too late ? He would never forgive himself . He 'd have to take her with him . <p> Bennett scooped up Erin 's limp and nearly lifeless body in his arms and rushed her out of the small tent that had become their home . Dressed only in the shorts and T-shirt he typically slept in-he was n't even wearing shoes or sandals-he began working his way to the medical compound on the other side of the camp . But that proved tougher than expected . <p> Even so late at night , large numbers of people remained up and about , congregating here and there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tent city of nearly five thousand refugees . Some begged for food . Others dealt drugs . Some smoked water pipes , while others drank away their woes . Old men talked politics . Old women gossiped . Young boys chased each other , while teenage girls roamed in packs , whispering and giggling and wishing the boys were chasing them . Anything that passed the interminable hours of isolation and despair was fair game , it seemed , and the cries of unwanted and unexpected babies-more and more each month-filled the night . <p> Bennett elbowed his way through the crowds , finally pushing free and spotting the camp 's primary care clinic , not far from the front gate , heavily armed by U.N . peacekeeping forces in their distinctive blue helmets . His pulse was racing . The muscles in his arms were burning . His legs were ready to give way . But he pressed on for Erin 's sake , racing across an empty helicopter landing pad and bursting in the front door . <p> " Help , quick , I need a doctor . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking him questions in Arabic . <p> " English , " he insisted . " Do you speak English ? " <p> Apparently not . She kept asking him questions he did n't understand , insisting on information he could n't give . <p> Bennett looked to the right and then to the left . He called out for anyone who spoke English . But no one responded . His panic intensified . Erin 's olive skin was rapidly turning gray and clammy , and he had no idea what else to do . <p> Suddenly , a young woman appeared through a side doorway . <p> " What seems to be the trouble , sir ? " she asked with a slight accent that might have been British but could very well have been Australian . <p> " I do n't know , " Bennett conceded , his voice catching . " We were just getting ready for bed when she started vomiting , over and over again . She could n't stop . Eventually she started dry heaving , and then she just collapsed . " <p> " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Nothing-maybe a few crackers , " he replied . " She has n't had much of an appetite for the last week or so . " <p> " She 's burning up , " the nurse said , feeling Erin 's forehead and sticking a digital thermometer in her ear . " One hundred five , " she said a moment later . <p> Jon gasped . It was so high . Too high . And it was spiking so quickly . He did n't remember her having a fever when this had begun . Where was all this coming from ? What was happening ? And why ? <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
