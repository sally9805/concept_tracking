We 're blessed , from time to time , with a spontaneous generation of humor and insight . And nowhere is this more exciting than in the emergence or the reinvention of an art form . Ruth Draper did it onstage . She took a parlor turn , the monologue , and turned it into great American drama . Nichols and May took the traditions of the Jewish wedding jester , the commedia dell'arte and the vaudeville comic , and invented improvisational theater . And now here 's Ira Glass , 42 , who seems to have reinvented radio . <P> Each week his public-radio show This American Life chooses a subject and invites writers to expatiate personal stories on that theme . Glass once did three hours on chickens . The piece de resistance was a memoir of an Israeli chicken kibbutz . The experience not only revealed the storyteller 's true sexual orientation , but showed that even immersion in the hell of the mass poultered wo n't turn one off the bird . " Oh no , " he said . " You 'll still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> A recent Glass money pitch for public radio hijacked the form and , I am sure , brought home the bacon . He found and interviewed a well-to-do gent who had neglected to contribute to his station . " But you listen to the station . You enjoy the programs . The station pays me . Do you think I should work for nothing ? " Glass asked . " Well , no , I ... " the man replied . And then there followed an impossibly long pause , which just got longer and longer , and sadder and funnier . <P> The old Jewish joke goes , " How do you make a Romanian omelet ? First , steal two eggs . " Glass 's programs sound as if their creator began by stealing a microphone . He finds  --  uncovers  --  drama and humor in the most pedestrian of places . O thou woods colt of Lord Buckley , out of Diane Arbus . Go thou and conquer . <P> David Mamet has written numerous films and plays , and won the Pulitzer Prize in 1984 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
