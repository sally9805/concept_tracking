<p> To trace Ana Ivanovic 's meteoric rise in women 's tennis , Montreal is as good a place to start as any . That was where , last August , the Serbian teen slugged her way to her first big title , beating former No. 1 Martina Hingis 6-2 , 6-3 in the final . <p> " I can say that was one of the breakthroughs I had , " says Ivanovic , whose win in Canada catapulted her to the US Open Series title and marked another milestone in her budding career . <p> " Winning the US Open Series was also something special for me , " Ivanovic says in her trademark rapid-fire English . " When you look at the people who won Montreal or the US Open Series , it was big names . It was pretty amazing that I was one of them . " <p> This time around it would n't look so amazing . <p> In just six weeks , Ivanovic transformed herself into a serious Grand Slam tournament contender with big showings in the French Open and Wimbledon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kuznetsova and Maria Sharapova before freezing up in the final against Justine Henin , who won her fourth title at Roland Garros . At Wimbledon she reached the last four , losing to eventual champion Venus Williams , who assessed her opponent as someone with " a lot of talent , a lot of power , a lot of potential . " <p> The results on clay and grass have forced Ivanovic , now at a career high No. 5 , to throw out the idea that cement is her best surface . <p> " I always used to say I like hardcourts the most , " she says , " but now I can say I like them all . " <p> If Montreal represented one breakthrough , Ivanovic 's meeting with 36-year-old Swiss entrepreneur Dan Holzmann in 2002 was another . <p> Like fellow top-five Serbians Jelena Jankovic and Novak Djokovic , Ivanovic and her family endured the hardships of living through the 1999 NATO bombings , six-hour bus rides to the nearest airport and a virtually non-existent tennis infrastructure at home . <p> Indoor tennis in their war-torn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been drained of water , laid with carpet and converted into two courts . <p> " It was impossible to play crosscourt because it was this far from the wall , " Ivanovic said last month while gesturing with two fingers close together . " So we had to keep playing down the lines . " <p> Holzmann , co-owner of a successful vitamin company , had heard about Ivanovic from his tennis instructor , a man of Serbian descent . Soon after , 14-year-old Ivanovic and her parents flew to meet Holzmann in Basel , Switzerland . Intrigued and aware that Ivanovic 's sponsor was facing bankruptcy , he agreed to provide an interest-free loan for coaching , travel and equipment that eventually reached $500,000 . <p> " I asked Ana what she wanted from life , " Holzmann says of the day they met . " She looked me in the eye and replied , ' I want to be No. 1 in the world . ' I was smitten at that moment . I took a quick decision that I would help her with financial assistance . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investments . Ivanovic , who has earned more than $2.5 million in prize money , paid back the loan within two years of turning pro , and Holzmann is now her full-time business manager . <p> " He always believed in me , and that 's been very important because coming from Serbia it was very hard , " Ivanovic says . <p> Fanfare has come quickly for the likable Serbians , whose charm and stellar play have been the talk of the pro tour this season . After Roland Garros , where Ivanovic , Jankovic and Djokovic reached the semifinals , they received a hero 's welcome in Belgrade . From a balcony outside the parliament buildings , 15,000 boisterous fans cheered . <p> " Everything has happened too fast ; it 's still hard to absorb everything , " Ivanovic says . <p> Despite the crush of attention at home and increasingly abroad , Ivanovic has handled the scrutiny with aplomb and graciousness while keeping her feet firmly on the ground . The truth is , she 's not just a player with pinup qualities ( her personal website @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sharapova ) . She 's genuinely nice . <p> Put on the spot about her good looks by tabloid reporters in London , Ivanovic politely replied she was flattered . Her peers seem to like her . For this interview , she thanked a reporter for his time  --  twice . <p> " Ana has never involved herself in petty jealousies , never moaned that her poster somewhere was smaller than someone else 's , " Holzmann says . <p> However , Ivanovic 's sweet nature has invariably drawn questions about her killer instinct . That line of thinking was amplified by her performance at Roland Garros and Wimbledon . <p> In the two biggest matches of her life , the 6-1 Serb with the killer forehand played tentatively and scared , managing a total of nine games in the two lopsided losses . <p> " I have to learn how to deal with it better , " says Ivanovic , who lost 6-2 , 6-4 to Williams at Wimbledon . <p> Holzmann , for one , is n't concerned . <p> " When on the court , she does have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do believe that you can be No. 1 and still be nice . " <p> Ivanovic says she is looking forward to defending her US Open Series crown , but her trimmed-down schedule will make that more challenging . With so many matches the last few weeks , she plans to enter two events before the Open , in San Diego and Toronto ( the men and women alternate between Montreal and Toronto each year ) , down from three last year . <p> " I feel I need some time off , " she says . " By the time you get to the U.S. Open , you get a little bit tired and exhausted . " <p> Ivanovic also hopes to improve on last year 's performance in New York , where , between shopping runs to Fifth Avenue and SoHo , she lost to eight-time Grand Slam champion Serena Williams in the third round . <p> " I am really excited to go back this year and try to go even further , " Ivanovic says . <p> : <p> The Ivanovic file <p> Age : 19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Birthplace : Belgrade , Serbia <p> Residence : Basel , Switzerland <p> WTA Tour ranking : 5 <p> 2007 record : 36-12 ( 160-54 career ) <p> 2007 titles : 1 , Berlin Open ( 3 career titles ) <p> Season highlights : Besides her title , Ivanovic has made a big impact in the last two Grand Slam events , reaching the French Open final ( lost to Justine Henin ) and the Wimbledon semifinals ( lost to eventual champion Venus Williams ) . ...
