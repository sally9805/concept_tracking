Deserted by her boyfriend in a Wal-Mart parking lot , the pregnant Novalee Nation ( Natalie Portman ) takes up residence in the store , where she has her baby . In short order she makes friends ( Stockard Channing , Ashley Judd ) , gets a life ( as a photographer ) and meets a decent chap ( James Frain ) she slowly learns to love . To say that Heart is a fable of feminist empowerment is to understate a very sentimental case . But the film is well played , particularly by Portman and Judd ( who ca n't stop having babies ) , and you may find yourself , against all common sense , surrendering to its good , manipulative nature . <P>  --  By Richard Schickel
