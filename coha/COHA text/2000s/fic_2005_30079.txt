Chapter One Travel broadens , they say . My personal experience has been that , in the short term at any rate , it merely flattens , aiming its steam-roller of deadlines and details straight at one 's daily life , leaving a person flat and gasping at its passage . On the first of January , 1924 , I was enjoying a peaceful New Year 's evening with my partner and husband , Sherlock Holmes , in our snug stone house on the Sussex Downs , blissfully unaware that scarcely forty hours later I would be sprinting desperately for a train across a snow-covered railway siding . But on the first day of the new year , I was at peace and I was at home , with a full stomach , a tipsy head , and-most pleasant of all-warm feet . No fewer than three bottles of wine stood on the sideboard , in various stages of depletion . Holmes had just taken a connoisseur 's sip of the last to appear in our glasses , a dusty port twice as old as I. He sighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It is good to find that the French vineyards are recovering from the War , " he noted , although of the three wines , only the champagne had gone into its bottle since 1918 . I agreed , rather absently I will admit . As I took a swallow of the glorious liquid , it occurred to me that some part of the back of my mind was braced for a ring of the telephone or a furious pounding on the door . The visceral mistrust of leisure was perhaps understandable : Twice in the past six months the outside world had crashed in on us ; indeed , we had been similarly seated before the fire one evening a scant two months earlier when an investigation literally fell into our arms , in the form of an old friend with a bloodied head . It was not yet midnight , and I had no faith in our stout oaken door to keep out surprises of the kind Holmes tended to attract . However , pleasantly enough , no pounding fist came to trouble our companionship or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next morning , fortified ourselves with one of Mrs. Hudson 's hearty breakfasts ( this one even more elaborate than usual , to make up for her being cheated of preparing the dinner for this , my twenty-fourth birthday ) , and bundled into our warmest clothes for the sleet-drenched trip to London . We rode the train in silence , taken up with our thoughts and with the newspapers , both as cheerless as the landscape outside the windows . Foot-and-mouth disease , the rising Seine , and doomsayers with apocalyptic predictions on both sides of the Atlantic , set off by the recent Labour victory . Grimmer yet was the real reason for our visit to the great city . We had no end of business there , of course , from a long-delayed appointment with the bank manager to calling on a noble family in order to follow up on our most recently concluded investigation , but in truth , we were there to see Holmes ' brother Mycroft , whose health was giving , as the euphemism goes , cause for concern . He was home from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and embarked on his own programme of therapy . I personally would n't have thought a near-starvation diet of meat and red wine combined with long hours of vigorous calisthenics would be the best thing for a shaky heart , but not even Holmes ' arguments made much of an inroad on Mycroft 's determination . We had maintained a closer contact with him than usual over the past week and a half , none of us voicing the thought that each visit could well be our last . We hurried through the day 's business , I listening with half an ear to the urgent recitation of calamity that trembled over the head of my American possessions , thinking only that , affection for my father or not , the time had come to rid myself of his once-cherished properties across the sea . I kept glancing at my wrist-watch , until finally with a sigh my solicitor threw up metaphorical hands , gave me the papers that required my signature , and allowed me to escape . When we arrived at Mycroft 's door , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not seem to be doing him any harm . He was up and around , and if he opened the door in his slippers and dressing-gown , he moved without hesitation and had colour in his face . There was also nearly a stone less of him than there had been on Christmas Day , which made his jowls flaccid and his eyes more hooded than usual . " Many happy returns of the day , Mary , " he said , and to Holmes , " I believe you 'll find a corkscrew on the tray , if you 'd be so kind . " After toasts came the inevitable discussion of the impending disaster that the new Labour government was certain to bring in . Predictions were rife , that the institution of marriage was sure to be done away with , that rubles would replace the pound sterling , the Boy Scouts and the monarchy would be abolished , the House of Lords sold for housing flats-everything short of plagues and rains of frogs . There were strong rumours that the Prime Minister would refuse to step down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis if not outright revolution ; the newspapers that morning had mentioned the concern of America , politeness thinly concealing Washington 's growing alarm . When I said something of the sort , Mycroft nodded . " Yes , the Americans are becoming increasingly nervous about the Reds . They seem to envision a Socialist state that stretches from London to Peking , and do n't know whether to be more worried about the Bolsheviks succeeding , or about the chaos that will follow if they fail . " When we had exhausted the various topics , we sat down to a meal only marginally less sumptuous than one of Mycroft 's usual , accompanied by what passed for small talk and polite conversation in the Holmes household , in this case an interesting development in forensic science from America and a nice murder that was baffling the authorities . Dessert was a small decorated cake , which none of us ate . The pouring of coffee , offer of brandy , and fingering of cigars indicated that the meal was finished , business could be resumed . The talk circled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minority government , before Mycroft took a last , ritual mouthful from his cup , put it onto the table , and asked , " Have you been following the news from Russia ? " My head snapped up as if he 'd hauled back on my reins-which in a way , he had : I knew him far too well to think his question innocent . " No ! " I said sharply , before things could edge one syllable further down that slippery slope . " I absolutely refuse to go to Moscow in January . " He made a show of shifting feebly in his chair , letting out a quiet sigh of infirmity before he looked up . " I said nothing about Moscow . " " Siberia , then . Some place either deadly or freezing , or both . " He abandoned the attempt at innocence . " I would go myself , " he tried , but at my disbelieving snort and Holmes ' raised eyebrow , he dropped that as well . All the world knew that Mycroft Holmes went nowhere outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Dr Watson had once referred to Mycroft 's unexpected appearance in their Baker Street flat as akin to finding a tram-car running down a country lane . It did , however , answer a question that had been in the back of my mind ever since the general election , namely , how would the radical change in government affect Mycroft ? Mycroft 's role in the outgoing Tory government was as undefined as it was enormous ; it seemed he intended to simply ignore the shuffling of office-holders all around him . " What has happened , Mycroft ? " Holmes asked , drawing my attention back to the until-now overlooked fact that , if Mycroft , in his condition , had been consulted on a matter by whichever government , it had to have struck someone as serious indeed . By way of answer , the big man reached inside the folds of his voluminous silken dressing-gown and pulled out a flat , oilskin-wrapped packet about three inches square . He put it onto the linen cloth and pushed it across the table in our direction . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holmes retrieved the grimy object , turned it over , and began to pick apart the careful tucks . The oilskin had clearly been folded in on itself for some time , but parted easily , revealing a smaller object , a leather packet long permeated by sweat , age , and what appeared to be blood . This seemed to have been sewn shut at least two or three times in its life . The most recent black threads had been cut fairly recently , to judge by their looseness ; no doubt that explained the easy parting of the oilskin cover . Holmes continued unfolding the leather . Inside lay three much-folded documents , so old the edges were worn soft , their outside segments stained dark by long contact with the leather . I screwed up my face in anticipation of catastrophe as Holmes began to unfold the first one , but the seams did not actually part , not completely at any rate . He eased the page open , placing a clean tea-spoon at its head and an unused knife at its foot to keep it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he set to work on the second . The stained document before me seemed to be a soldier 's clearance certificate , and although the name , along with most of the words , was almost completely obscured by time and salt , it looked to belong to a K-something O'Meara , or O'Mara . The date was unreadable , and could as easily have been the 1700s as the past century-assuming they issued clearance certificates in the 1700s . I turned without much hope to the second document . This was on parchment , and although it appeared even older than the first and had been refolded no less than four times into different shapes , it had been in the center position inside the leather pouch , and was not as badly stained . It concerned the same soldier , whose last name now appeared to be O'Hara , and represented his original enlistment . I could feel Mycroft 's eyes on me , but I was no more enlightened than I had been by the certificate representing this unknown Irishman 's departure from Her Majesty 's service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care he might have given a first-century papyrus . He made no attempt to weigh down the edges of this one , merely let the soft , crude paper rest where it would lest it dissolve into a heap of jigsaw squares along the scored folds . I craned my head to see the words ; Holmes , however , just glanced at the pages , seeming to lose interest as soon as he had freed them . He sat aside and let me look to my heart 's content . This was a birth certificate , for a child born in some place called Ferozepore in the year 1875 . His father 's name clarified the difficulties of the K-something from the other forms : Kimball . I looked up , hoping for an explanation , only to find both sets of grey Holmes eyes locked expectantly onto me . How long , I wondered , before I stopped feeling like some slow student facing her disappointed headmistress ? " I 'm sorry , " I began , and then I paused , my mind catching at last on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Add to that a town that could only be in India .... No ; oh , no-the book was just a children 's adventure tale . " I 'm sorry , " I repeated , only where before it had connoted apology , this time it was tinged with outrage . " This does n't have anything to do with Kim , does it ? The Kipling book ? " " You 've read it ? " Mycroft asked . " Of course I 've read it . " " Good , that saves some explaining . I believe this to be his amulet case . " " He 's real , then ? Kipling 's boy ? " " As real as I am , " said Sherlock Holmes . " And yes , this is his amulet . I recognize it . " " You know him ? " I do n't know why this revelation startled me as if he 'd claimed to have met a hippogryph ; heavens , half the world considered Holmes fictional . But startle me it did . " I knew him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year in each other 's company . " " When ? " He smiled to himself . " While I was dead . " I knew my husband and partner was not referring to some spiritualist experience of a previous lifetime . " When I was dead " was his whimsical term for the period beginning in the spring of 1891 , when he disappeared at Switzerland 's Reichenbach Falls , and for three years wandered the globe , returning to London only when a mysterious murder called him back to the land of the living . Knowing that Mycroft had preserved his Baker Street rooms for him during those three years , and knowing what Mycroft was , I had no doubt that at least a portion of that time , Holmes had been about the Queen 's business . Still , I had never heard the details . I was not to hear them now , either . Holmes had already turned to his brother , and was asking , " How did these come to you ? " " Through the hands of a certain captain who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " The man who currently holds the same position that Creighton did then , fellow by the name of Nesbit . " " And the story that accompanied them ? " " So tenuous as to be nonexistent . An Afghan trader brings a rumour that a light-skinned native man is being held by a hill raja . Six months later , a camel caravan modifies the story , that the man was being held but took ill and died , asking that these , his last effects , be returned to his people . We did trace the amulet 's arrival to such a caravan , but no man could say who had carried it south , or whence it came . " Holmes nodded , but said only , " I find it difficult to imagine that particular individual being held against his will . " I broke in , with a request I did not think unreasonable , particularly as we seemed to be on the edge of being dragged into a case involving Kimball O'Hara . " I 'd appreciate a little background information , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you knew the boy . " Holmes glanced sideways at his brother , assessing his condition , then suggested , " Perhaps it would be best if we saved the tale for a later time . " I started to protest , then decided that Mycroft 's colour was indeed not peak , and brought my curiosity under control , allowing them to continue . Mycroft answered , " As you say , it takes some doing to imagine O'Hara in custody for more than a few days . He was-how did you put it to me ? ' Wily as a mongoose , slippery as a cobra , more deadly than either . ' " " If not in custody , then what ? " " The Bear is awakening . " " ' The Bear , ' " I said . " You mean Russia ? But I thought our relations with them had settled down-do n't we even have a trade agreement now with the Bolsheviks ? " ( Continues ... )                 @ @ @ @
