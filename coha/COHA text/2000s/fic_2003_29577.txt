Chapter One When the thunder bolt hits , duck , baby , duck " Happy birthday to you ... " Remy LeDeux 's head shot up from the mug of " burnt roast , " the thick Cajun coffee he 'd been nursing at his galley table . Who came out to Bayou Black to visit him on his houseboat ? " Happy birthday to you ... " Oh , no ! Oh , no , no , no ! Please , God , not today ! Steps were approaching his door . It better not be Luc and Ren . I am not in the mood for their games . Unbidden , a memory flashed through his mind of a birthday twelve years ago when his brothers Lucien and Ren had shown up at the VA burn hospital following one of his numerous operations . They had brought with them Ronald McDonald , but what a Ronald McDonald ! Underneath the clown outfit had been a half-naked , six-foot- tall , Bourbon Street female impersonator with a body that could rival Marilyn Monroe 's , appropriately singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There had been a lot of military vet patients cheered up that day when she ... he ... whatever ... had passed out Happy Meal cartons as favors , all containing talking condoms , red vibrator lips and edible thongs . " Happy birthday , dear Remy ... " Remy peered through the dust-moted dimness toward his open door . It was definitely not Ronald McDonald , or a sexy stripper , not even his teasing brothers . Much worse . It was his seventy-nine-year-old great-aunt Lulu , who was all of five feet tall , and she was carrying a cake the size of a bayou barge with a pigload of candles on top . " Happy birthday to you , " she concluded and used her non-existent butt to ease the wooden screen door open and sidle inside . Today his aunt wore a Madonna T-shirt with cone cups painted in the vicinity of her non-existent breasts , and a flame red spandex miniskirt . Who knew they made them in midget sizes ? On her feet were what could only be described as white hooker boots . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the efforts of his half-sister Charmaine who ran a hoity-toity beauty spa over in Houma , Looks to Kill , as well as a regular hair salon , Kuts &; Kurls , in Lafayette . Uncertain whether the pink color was in honor of his birthday or an accident , he decided not to ask . Despite her age and always outrageous appearance , his aunt 's services as a noted traiteur or healer were still needed up and down the swamp lands . Unfortunately , of late she believed that he was the one most in need of her care . If he could have , he would have fled , but where could a six-foot-two ex-Air Force officer hide in a houseboat ? Besides , he could n't ever be rude to his aunt , who was dear to him . " Tante Lulu ! Welcome , chre , welcome . " He stood and emptied his mug into the sink , then took the cake from her , placing it on the table . On its white iced top , mixed in with the thirty-three candles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in bright blue letters . Typical sentiment . But in the corners stood four tiny plastic statues of St. Jude , the patron saint of hopeless cases . St. Jude was a favorite of Tante Lulu . He almost asked her what his birthday and hopeless cases had in common , but he caught himself just in time . She kissed him on the cheek then , which involved her standing on tiptoes and his leaning down . And was n't it just like his aunt to kiss his bad cheek , the one so disfigured by that ' copter crash in Desert Storm twelve years ago ? Most people would at least flinch . She did n't even blink . " Didja think I 'd let you stay here alone like a hermit on your special day ? Bad bizness , that-being alone so much . Lost your joie de vivre , you have . Never fear , I have a feelin ' this is gon na be your year for love . Whass that smell ? Poo-ey ! Stinks like burnt okra . " He plopped back down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee in his pot , wrinkle her nose , then dump the contents down his sink . Within seconds , a fresh pot perked on the stove . " Tante Lulu , this is not my year for love . Do n't you be starting on me . I am not interested in love . " " Hanky-panky , thass all you menfolks are interested in . I may be seventy , but I ai n't blind . " " More like eighty , sweet pea , " he reminded her . " And do n't for one minute think I 'm gon na discuss hanky-panky with you . " " Not to worry , though , sweetie , " his aunt rambled on . " I got time to concentrate on you now . I 'm gon na find you a wife . Guar-an-teed ! Love doan ask you if you 're ready ; it jist comes like a thunder bolt . " Over my dead body , he vowed silently . " That 's nice . " He decided to change the subject . " How did you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pick-up truck . " His aunt was bent over now-and , yes , he 'd been right about her having no behind anymore . She was trying to shove off to the side the saddle he 'd left in the middle of the room- a reminder of his ranching days . But then his aunt 's words hit him belatedly , like a sledgehammer . " Tee-John ? Mon Dieu , Tante Lulu ! He 's only fourteen years old . He does n't have a license . " Tee-John was his half-brother , the youngest of many children , legitimate and otherwise , born to Valcour LeDeux , their common father . His aunt shrugged . " My T-bird 's in the shop . This place , she needs some light . Mebbe you ought a install a skylight . It 's so dark and dreary . No wonder you 're always so grumpy . " A skylight in a houseboat that 's as old as I am ? " About your car ? " he asked grumpily . Now she was checking out the mail on his desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine that ? " Yeah , he could imagine that . It was probably one of his brothers , trying to keep their aunt off the highways . " Where is the brat ? " " Outside playin ' with that pet alligator of yours , I reckon . You ought a get yerself a wife . A man your age should be pettin ' his woman , not some slimy bayou animal . If I dint know you better , I 'd think you were into those pee-verse- uns I read about in one of Charmaine 's Cosmo magazines . You got any heavy cream for caf au lait ? " He decided to ignore the wife remark , and the perversion remark , and , no , he did n't keep heavy cream in the house . " Useless ? I do not pet Useless . " He 'd named the old alligator who lived in his bayou neighborhood Useless because he was , well , useless . " I toss him scraps occasionally . Tee-John better not be feedin ' him Moon Pies and RC Cola again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up he practically swam a marathon up and down the bayou . A sugar high , no doubt . " Tante Lulu was nosing around in his cupboards now . Most likely , searching for evidence of perversions . " Dad 's gon na be furious at Tee-John for driving without a license-and taking his vehicle . " " It doan take much to make that Valcour red in the face ... which he use'ly is from booze anyways , " Tante Lulu said icily . His great-aunt hated their father with a passion , with good reason . " He 's already spittin ' mad at Tee-John . The boy is grounded for two weeks . " Remy was about to point out that driving her to his remote bayou home did n't count as grounded , but figured logic was not a part of any conversation with his aunt . " Why is he grounded ? " " Went to a underwear option party up in Natchitoches . That boy , he is some kind of wild . " She shook her pink spirals from side to side and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " A lingerie party ? A teenage boy at a lingerie party ? That does n't sound right . Then , understanding dawned . " Oh . Do you mean underwear optional ? " " Thass what I said , dint I ? There was a hundred boys and girls running around with bare butts wavin ' in the wind when the police got there . Lordy , Lordy ! " He started to grin . But not for long . She was standing before his open freezer , empty except for two ice-cube trays . The way she was gawking you would have thought he had a dead body in there-a very small dead body , considering the minuscule size of the compartment . " You ai n't got nothin ' in your freeze box , " she announced , as if he did n't already know that . " Where 's the ice cream ? We sure-God got ta have ice cream with a birthday cake . " " Tante Lulu , I do n't need ice cream . " Really , the old lady only meant good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The youngens do . " His neck prickled with apprehension . " What youngens ? " " Luc and Sylvie 's chillen , thass who . You dint think we 'd have a party for you without the rest of the fam'ly , didja ? " Of course not . What was I thinking ? He would have put his head on the table if the cake did n't take up all the space . " Ren could n't come ' cause he 's in Washington on that fish lobby bizness , but he said to wish you ' Happy , Happy Birthday ' and to expect a Happy Meal in the mail . Do you know what he 's talkin ' ' bout ? " " Do n't have a clue , " he lied . In walked Tee-John . What a misnomer ! Tee-John was definitely no Little-John . At almost fifteen , he was not done growing , not by a Louisiana long shot , but already he was close to six feet tall . And full of himself , as only a born-to-be- bad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the neckline of his black " Ragin ' Cajun " T-shirt to the bottoms of his baggy cargo shorts . He grinned from ear to ear . " Hey , Remy . " " Hey , Tee-John . " " Happy birthday , bro . " " Thanks , bro . " " Can I go check out your ' copter up there on the hill ? " Nice try , kiddo . " NO ! " The boy would probably decide to take the half-million-dollar piece of equipment for a spin . Never mind that it was the backbone of Remy 's employment or that he was in hock to the bank up to his eye-balls . Never mind that Tee-John did n't know a propeller from a weed whacker . Tee-John waggled his eyebrows at him , as if to say he had just been razzing and Remy had risen to the bait . " You jump in that pick-up , boy , and go buy us some ice cream at Boudreaux 's General Store , " Tante Lulu ordered Tee-John . " How come you wearin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his money and ca n't afford to buy you new pants ? " " That 's the style , auntie . " He chucked her playfully under the chin . " What style ? Thass no style , a'tall . " She swatted his teasing fingers away . " And do n't you be flirtin ' with that Boudreaux girl , neither . Her Daddy said he 's gon na shoot yer backside with buckshot next time you come sniffin ' around . " " Me ? " Tee-John said , putting a hand over his heart with wounded innocence . Outside , a car door slammed , followed by the pounding of little feet on the wooden wharf . The shrieking of three little girls could only be three-year-old Blanche Marie , two-year- old Camille , and one-year-old Jeanette . The admonition of Luc and Sylvie echoed : " Do not dare to touch that alligator . " Remy heard a loud roar of animal outrage , which pretty much translated to , " Enough is enough ! " Then a loud splashing noise . Useless was no fool ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door to buy ice cream , or to escape the inevitable chaos that accompanied Luc 's family . " Guess what Luc is considerin ' ? " He threw over his shoulder . " Putting you in a dimwit protection program till you 're , oh , let 's say twenty-one ? " he offered . Luc was a lawyer , and a good one , too . If anyone could tame Tee-John down , it was Luc . Look what he 'd accomplished with him and Ren . Tee-John ignored Remy 's sarcasm . " Luc is thinkin ' about gettin ' neutered . " " The hell you say ! " was Remy 's immediate reaction . " Well , kiss my grits and call me brunch , " Tante Lulu said . " Where did you hear such a thing ? " " Sylvie told her friend Blanche who told Charmaine who told everyone in Houma that Luc went to see a doctor about one of those vas-ec-to-mies . Luc and Sylvie got a scare last month when Sylvie thought she might be knocked up again . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Guess those little squigglies of his are too potent . " He grinned as he relayed the gossip . Really , keeping a secret in the bayou was like trying to hold " no-see-ems " in a fish net . The little gnats were impossible to contain . On second thought , Remy could see Luc taking such drastic action . After having " Irish triplets " -a baby born every nine months-he and Sylvie were both ready to shut down the baby assembly line . But a vasectomy ? He cringed at the thought . And was n't it ironic that Luc was determined to stop having kids when Remy would never have any of his own ? Just before Tee-John went out the door , his aunt added , " Tee-John , when you come back , remember to bring in Remy 's birthday present from the truck . " She smiled broadly at Remy . " Your very own hope chest . " " A hope chest ? A hope chest for a man ? " Remy winced . " No friggin ' way ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't speak that way in front of women , especially Tante Lulu . " Sorry , ma'am . " " You 'll be feeling lots better , once I get your hope chest filled , and we find you a good Cajun wife . I made a list . " She waved a piece of paper that had at least twenty names on it . Remy groaned . " Plus , I 'm gon na say a novena to St. Jude to jump start the bride search . " Remy groaned again . " I 'm thinkin ' we should launch this all off with a big fais do do , a party down on the bayou . " " Launch what ? " Remy choked out . " Your bride search . Ai n't you listenin ' , boy ? With all the women there , you would have a chance to cull down the list . " " Bad idea , auntie . " " Mebbe we could have it at Luc and Sylvie 's place . They have a big yard where we can set up tents for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ren might even come play with his old band . " She talked over him as if he was n't even there . He should n't be surprised . It was se fini pas , a thing without end , the way his family interfered in each other 's lives . Forget about the government contract he was about to undertake . If he had any sense , Remy would run off to some faraway country , like California , where no one could find him , especially his interfering family . But first , he 'd set fire to everything here : the houseboat , the ' copter , all his belongings , the hope chest . He was only half kidding while playing out this tempting fantasy in his head . It would be the biggest bonfire in bayou history , though . Then , he would be free . Yeah , right , some inner voice said . It was probably St. Jude . ( Continues ... )                    @
