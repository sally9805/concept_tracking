Learning in the Company of Adults // One afternoon I find myself approaching a group of young teenagers hanging // out in our hallways . They aren " t hanging out surreptitiously . They are not // always within earshot , but they frequently make it known that they are // nearby , where we adults are also hanging out  --  fixing our rooms , meeting // together informally , arguing about some important matter or other . They give // me the distinct impression that they want both to have their own world and to // be sure it is connected to ours . // Still I am obliged to remind them ( and myself ) , " School was over an hour ago . // You can " t hang out in the school like this ; it " s not safe . " I mean safe for me , // of course . I am worried about liability issues . Some years earlier an amused // but genuinely curious adolescent boy had even put the irony into words for // me : " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the street ? " So as // usual I let it go with a warning that neither they nor I take seriously . // Two things move me about the memory of these events , and countless // others like them : the genuine , heartfelt desire of young people to be in the // company of adults who are doing adult work , and the way our institutions and // adult lives are structured more and more to keep us at a distance . As I think // back on more than thirty years in schools , I believe that the contradiction // between these two facts is the central educational dilemma of our times . In // those boys " desire to hang out with and around adults lies the secret , the key // to transforming our schools  --  and the key to the best avenues to learning . // A television interviewer talking to a group of high school dropouts some years // ago asked them whether they knew any grown-ups who were college // graduates . They all said no . Not true , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known a dozen or more teachers over the years , all of whom had attended // college . But I was wrong . As I began to pay closer attention I realized that of // course they had not known any of their teachers . We adults were invisible to // them . In commenting to a friend about how disrespected I felt when some // teenagers poured in the subway car playing loud music , using what appeared // to me inappropriate public language , and dressed to shock , I was reminded // that , alas , my assumption that they were doing this " to annoy " might be // wishful thinking  --  maybe they didn " t really register our presence at all . // It " s a striking fact that kids don " t keep a lot of company these days with the // kind of adults  --  in or out of school  --  whom they might grow up to be ( or whom // we might wish them to grow up to be ) ; in fact , they don " t keep genuine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family . Our children // don " t work alongside adults in ways that , for good or bad , were once the // norm for most young people in training to become adults . Even when they // take jobs , it " s usually in the company of teenagers  --  at a Gap or McDonald " s. // Is this phenomenon truly new ? Yes . And does it have an impact on the trust // necessary for good schooling ? Yes again . // A century ago , even less , children made the transition to adulthood early , // steeped in the company of adults . Surely by fifteen or sixteen , when a // majority of youngsters today are still a half dozen years or more away from // entering the adult world , most were already in the thick of adult lives : having // children , earning a living . They spent their time in the midst of multiage // settings from birth on  --  small communities , farms , workplaces where they // knew grown-ups intimately and knew a lot about how they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . Being young in the olden days wasn " t // idyllic , not by a long shot . It " s useful to say this to oneself over and over . The // early immersion in adulthood that characterized life a century ago was for // many a source of enormous pain and hardship . Good people worked hard to // help create a longer and more protected childhood . But for good or ill , until // quite recently , most of the learning of how to be an adult took place formally // or informally in the company of grown-ups  --  by working alongside them , // picking up the language and customs of grown-upness through both // instruction and immersion , much as they had learned to talk and walk . // Children once learned the arts and crafts of being a grown-up by belonging to // a community whose habits and rituals they naturally absorbed . When I was // born , the majority of young people even in the United States never attended // high school , and what they learned from formal schooling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting on in the world . Usually the trades they went // into were ones they were very familiar with and had observed for many years , // and thus taking on adult burdens came about gradually , step by step . The // passage from being a novice to becoming an expert was often very gradual // and had little to do with formal schooling . Children gradually absorbed  --  // sometimes uncomfortably  --  the skills , aptitudes , and attitudes that went // along with membership in the " club " of adulthood , in psycholinguist Frank // Smith " s apt metaphor . They found the present and future predictable and , at // least in that sense , trustworthy . However conservative a vision such a style of // learning suggested  --  generation following generation in orderly progression learning communities of yesterday , we // invented schools and then systematically began to downgrade anything // learned in nonschool ways . Schools bore the burden of replacing many if not // most of the functions of those former multiage communities  --  and at // increasingly earlier ages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate , the schools that replaced those natural learning communities // simultaneously underwent a transformation too  --  toward greater // depersonalization. // Formal learning in particular deliberately ignored what might have been the // strengths of the traditional routes from childhood to adulthood . Most children // today are disconnected from any community of adults  --  including , absurdly , // the adults they encounter in schools . Many young people literally finish four // years of high school without knowing or being known by a single adult in the // school building . Dry textbooks and standardized curricula unconnected with // any passions or interests of children , delivered by adults in seven , eight , or // sometimes nine 45-minute time slots , dominate schooling . // We " ve invented schools that present at best a caricature of what the kids // need in order to grow up to be effective citizens , skillful team members , // tenacious and ingenious thinkers , or truth seekers . They sit , largely // passively , through one after another different subject matter in no special // order of relevance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , much // less would like to become . The older they get , the less like " real life " their // schooling experience is  --  and the more disconnected and fractionated . As // my granddaughter Sarah tells me with delight at her new eight-period // schedule ( which she knows I disapprove of ) : " But Grandma , it " s more fun ; // there " s no time to get bored  --  you " re in and out so fast , and you get a chance // to chat with friends between classes . " Children are expected to learn to do // hard things in the absence of ever seeing experts at work doing such things  --  // to become shoemakers when they " ve never seen shoes or a shoemaker // making them . // We " ve cut kids adrift , without the support or nurturance of grown-ups , without // the surrounding of a community in which they might feel it safe to try out // various roles , listen into the world of adults whom they might someday want // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ages they must negotiate with a // variety of barely familiar adults , increasingly barren classrooms , and // increasingly complex institutional settings ; for many it starts as early as // three or four years of age . My grandson , in a big New York City elementary // school , spent his seven-year-old energies finding ways to avoid the halls , // bathrooms , lunchroom , and recess , where everyone he encountered was // likely to be a stranger  --  and a risk to his sense of safety . In some // communities kids go from one huge school to another every three years  --  by // design . Large schools designed exclusively for kindergarten through second // grade , grades three through five , grades six through eight , and grades ten // through twelve are not weird aberrations but are increasingly common . There // are nowadays fewer children in schools where there are likely to be teachers // they or their families have known over the years . We are  --  in short  --  perhaps // the only civilization in history that organizes its youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the less and less likely they are to know any adults . // I believe this needn " t be ; schools can turn around the distrustful distance that // the young experience toward the adult world . They can return children to the // company of adults in ways that meet the needs of a rapidly changing and // more globalized world . It " s not true that the best way to learn to deal with // adult change and trauma is to know nothing but change and trauma . In fact , // quite the opposite . Greater , not less , intimacy between generations is at the // heart of all the best school reform efforts around today and is the surest path // to restoring public trust in public education  --  while also enhancing the // capacity for creativity and novelty , which earlier forms of apprenticeship // learning often downgraded . // The kind of company I want children to keep with adults is essential to // learning . And the key building block of this relationship between student and // teacher is trust . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // genuine adult company , and the more trusted the adults must be . // Polly Wagner , our school " s math consultant , noted that seventh grader Jerry // was busily doing his geometry assignment but seemed to have no idea what // an angle was . But what " s so puzzling about an angle ? So we explored it with // Jerry . For one thing , it " s the first time he " s ever run into a measurement that // stays the same even when what " s being measured appears to get bigger . It // took a while for his teacher , Emily Chang , to figure out how to explain this to // herself , then to us , and along the way to a puzzled Jerry . As Emily pointed // out , in some self-astonishment , it isn " t a measurement " in that sense . " Aha , I // said . We tried to define different meanings of " measurement . " There we were , // three adults and one kid , puzzling over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we looked at it through Jerry " s eyes . // What is the setting that allowed Jerry to explore the obvious more fully with // us , and to have his confusion taken so seriously ? Furthermore , what was // required for the adults as well to find each other " s company so trustworthy // that we stopped for a moment to consider our own confusion ? What allowed // us to reconnect to the sense of surprise and wonder that is at the heart of // human learning ? // The key was that we risked showing ourselves to be learners alongside the // student . We teachers made it acceptable for Jerry to ask questions , because // we so clearly were asking questions we didn " t already know the answers to // ourselves . There is no way to get around it : the willingness to take risks , ask // questions , and make mistakes is a requirement for the development of // expertise . We can learn secretly , but at a price . If we act as if we take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely ) a " dumb " question , just occasions // when it is hard for us to understand where we " re each coming from , then we // can more readily go public with our confusions . And confusion is essential  --  if // uncomfortable . It " s the frequent outcome of allowing ourselves to pursue our // curiosity more deeply , to pay attention to the unexpected . Whatever do I // mean by " up " and " down " ? Why is it that I can forever go east but not forever // north ? Am I wrong that the sun used to rise over that building and now it // doesn " t ? However can it be that a big heavy metal boat doesn " t sink ? // Living without answers is unsettling , of course , but when we " re not required to // immediately pretend to master uncertainty , and probably only then , we can // make the slow intellectual leaps required of all children today . It " s not a // luxury that only a favored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The trustful // relationship with the world that this acceptance of uncertainty allows  --  with // respect to people , ideas , and things  --  is at the heart of learning . // Lots of successful students probably never really trusted teachers or school // systems when they were kids ; still they got by and even did well . How // come ? In part because kids were once school successes even if they never // took more than a year or so of math beyond arithmetic , at most a year of // science , and one or two courses in history . Most of what life required us to // learn happened over time in authentic , natural settings . Furthermore , what // the most successful students had going for them was that even in // kindergarten , with their hands eagerly raised , they were ready to show off // their school smarts . Starting on day one , certain forms of knowledge and // skill  --  the stuff they " ve eagerly brought with them from home  --  was confirmed // and honored , thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What they were good at grew out of trust  --  it " s just that the trust came from // something or someone outside of the schoolhouse. // But many other students never found a replacement for a school and teacher // who didn " t recognize their genius , who responded with a shrug or a look of // incomprehension as they offered their equally eager home truths . They too // soon learned that in school all they could show off was their ignorance . // Better to be bad , or uninterested , or to just silently withdraw . // Today schools are expected to impart , even to five-year-olds , more complex , // bookish , abstract knowledge than ever before , including much that is // counterintuitive. //
