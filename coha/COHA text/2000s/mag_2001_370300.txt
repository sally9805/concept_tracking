The Ghosts of Vietnam <P> " Undoubtedly , hundreds of women and children were killed in Vietnam . That 's the way war is , and it 's not going to change . " THOMAS C. DELAHUNTY Fayetteville , N.C. <P> I am amazed at the confusion in the accounts of what happened that fateful night when civilians were killed in Thanh Phong NATION , May 7 . The stories told by former Senator Bob Kerrey and his squad mate Gerhard Klann are completely different . Klann would have us believe it was a meticulous slaughter of unarmed women and children . Kerrey recalls that the killings were an accident that occurred during a confusing night of war . Since the stories are so contradictory , and we ca n't distinguish the truth , we should put this behind us and move forward . Judgment of these men will not be in our hands . PAUL DALE ROBERTS Elk Grove , Calif . <P> Kerrey is a genuine hero . The fact is that the Vietnam War is still being fought by former government officials , by refugees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own agenda . Should we discredit all our military personnel who spent time in that hell ? As someone who was against the war in the ' 60s and ' 70s , I say it 's time to let it rest . ALEX HOWARD North Bergen , N.J. <P> How many Japanese men , women and children were condemned to death when the U.S. bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki ? I am 86 years old and have lived through " the war to end all wars . " Do n't blame Kerrey for the slaughter at Thanh Phong . Blame the powers that be for sending men and women into battle . ESTHER MORRISON Santa Fe , N.M . <P> It disturbs me that there is no movement to put Kerrey on trial for the war crimes he is alleged to have committed . That is , after all , the usual process for ascertaining guilt and meting out punishment . I can not avoid the ugly thought that Americans ' concept of justice may be dependent on the citizenship of the accused and the color of the victims . DAVID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of us who actually fought in Vietnam have confessions lingering in some dark corner of our minds but have come to terms with the memories . Civilian casualties are an inevitable consequence of any war , and that will never change . Until mankind realizes the futility of war , civilian casualties , however regrettable , will remain an acceptable fact of life . BARRY W. LUNDGREN Woodstock , Ill . <P>  --  Many of you felt that Bob Kerrey 's treatment at the hands of the news media was the ugliest aspect of the controversy surrounding his confession . " American journalism has hit an all-time low , " wrote a Florida woman . " Reporters who hoped to ' hit it big ' with this story only exhibited their ignorance of history and war . " A New Jerseyan shared her disgust and was " taken aback by the arrogance and superior attitude of the press . Your need to know everything gives you no right to eviscerate Kerrey . How dare you ? " A Louisiana man who served in the military believes that Kerrey has nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media would stop hounding the men and women who served in Vietnam . They did what they had to do to stay alive . " <P> For the Love of Dope
