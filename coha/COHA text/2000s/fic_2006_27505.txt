Hitching to Cincinnati with a Guy Named Verne After the gloom of Dripping Fang Forest , the blue white light from the full moon was almost blinding . Cheyenne and Wally emerged from the trees and found themselves out on the highway . The sky in the east was only just beginning to lighten up at the edges . There was no traffic , but they could see a lone car approaching in the distance . " You think it 's safe to hitchhike ? " Wally asked . " Sure , " said Cheyenne . " What could possibly happen to us hitchhiking ? " " I do n't know , " said Wally , " but in the past twenty-four hours , we were adopted by two ladies who turned out to be giant ants , we were attacked by a glowing ten-foot-long slug , we nearly had our throats torn out by man-eating wolves , and a really nice professor who invited us to tea turned out to have a wife who 's an enormous eight-legged spider . And you 're asking what could happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were twins , their outlooks on life were quite different . Cheyenne saw only the good side of life , Wally only the bad . Cheyenne saw a beach and thought hot sand and thundering surf . Wally saw a beach and thought sunstroke , riptides , and choking on salt water . As the car approached , the twins stuck out their thumbs . They heard the high hum of the car 's tires go down the scale as it slowed up , then heard the car yerp to a stop . " Hi there ! " called the driver , a man with a gray crew cut . " You kids like a lift ? " " Yes , if you 're going toward Cincinnati , " asked Wally . " Sure am , " said the driver . " Hop in . " Wally climbed inside . Cheyenne got in after him and slammed the door . The car took off again . " Name 's Verne , " said the driver . " What they call you ? " " I 'm Cheyenne , he 's Wally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young to be out so late , all alone on a deserted highway , " said Verne . " Your mommy and daddy know you 're out so late ? " " Our mommy and daddy are dead , " said Wally . " Oh , sorry to hear that , " said Verne . " Who 's been takin ' care of you ? " " Hortense Jolly and two giant ants , " said Wally . " That 's okay , you do n't have to tell me if you do n't want to , " said Verne . " I was just makin ' conversation . Me , I used to work at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base . I was a janitor in Hangar 18 , where they did autopsies on the aliens they found in them UFO crashes . " " Really ? " said Cheyenne . She stifled a sneeze . " Yep . I swiped me a alien brain once as a souvenir . Put ' er in a jar of alcohol , figured she might be worth somethin ' someday . Keep ' er @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peek . " He winked at them . " Whattaya say , wan na take a peek at ' er ? " " No thanks , " said Wally . " We would n't want to slow you down . " " It would n't slow me down none , " said Verne . " It would n't take no time at all . I could just pull over to the shoulder and pop the trunk . " " Maybe some other time , " said Wally . " We 're in kind of a hurry to get back to Cincinnati . " " Fair enough , " said Verne , " fair enough . We 'll do it some other time , then . You just tell me when . " Wally leaned close to Cheyenne and whispered in her ear : " This guy 's a weirdo . First time he stops , we 're making a run for it . " Cheyenne nodded . Approaching them , way in the distance , were the headlights of a very large truck . She dreamily watched them getting larger and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to listen to while we drive ? " Verne asked . " Oh , happy songs , " said Cheyenne , blotting her runny nose . " Happy songs , eh ? Okay , let 's see what we got here , " said Verne . He leaned across the twins , opened the glove compartment , and started to rummage through it . " Maybe you should keep your eyes on the road , Verne , " said Wally . " Good advice , buddy , " said Verne , still rummaging . " Darned good advice . " The truck , an eighteen-wheeler , hurtled toward them in the opposite lane . As Verne 's car drifted over the double yellow line into its path , the truck driver flashed his brights and sounded his air horn . Verne kept on rummaging . Just before the vehicles collided in an ugly mangle of metal , Wally grabbed the steering wheel and yanked it hard to the right . The truck swerved . The car rocked violently in the whoosh of air from the passing truck . Wally yanked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Whoo-hoo ! " yelled Verne . " Close one ! The way these truckers drive , it 's a wonder they give ' em licenses at all , eh , Wally ? " " Yeah , " Wally gasped . " Well , little lady , " said Verne to Cheyenne , " all I could find is this here CD of Greatest Funeral Favorites , if that 's okay with you . " " That 's fine . " Cheyenne gulped . So they listened in silence to an hour of suffocatingly grim organ music from Greatest Funeral Favorites as they drove to Cincinnati while the sky turned pink in the east . The first stoplight they hit was a five-way intersection that bordered the swamps at the city limits . Cheyenne and Wally leaped out of the car and ran for their lives .
