<p> When Hiro Sone and his wife , Lissa Doumani , opened Terra in St. Helena in 1988 , nobody knew how to categorize the food . The restaurant is in a 100-year-old stone building that looks as if it could have been pulled from the Tuscan countryside , and Sone orchestrated an eclectic menu that incorporated what he learned in his native Japan and as chef of Spago in both Tokyo and Beverly Hills . <p> The menu has evolved slowly to include an increasing number of Asian touches , but it 's still strongly grounded in the West . <p> It took Ame , the couple 's new restaurant in San Francisco 's St. Regis Hotel , to give Sone a platform to freely mix cultures , often with glorious results . Some might categorize his handiwork as fusion , which has about as much cachet in the culinary world as a Nehru jacket does in fashion . <p> While there 's no arguing that Ame , which opened in November , has a Western sensibility , Sone and executive chef Greg Dunmore have crafted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the restaurant 's handsome interior . <p> The couple decided to join the San Francisco dining scene a little late in the game , after the restaurant was already under construction . They immediately stepped in and tried to restructure the interior to fit their style . Along with several designers , they 've created a serene space with a touch of mystery . <p> Diners walk down a long corridor that includes a glass-enclosed wine rack and dark travertine bricks that resemble highly polished wood . Myriad textures play off one another in the dining room , which is separated from the entrance by a screen of undulating dark wood strips . <p> The fusion of cultures is signaled by the sashimi bar and the open kitchen patrons pass on their way to one of the 92 seats in the L-shaped dining room , fitted with dark wood floors and walls that look like coarse-grained timber . Gauzy striped silk curtains on the floor-to-ceiling windows add mystique to the Mission Street scene outside . <p> The wall that surrounds the open kitchen and sashimi bar looks like the well-worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tops the 5-foot square table positioned on one end of the dining room . Two silk chandeliers gathered in the center look like an exotic underwater species , a cross between a sea urchin and a sea anemone , hovering above a sea of white tablecloths and ecru puckered Belgian linen . <p> Sone and Doumani also preside over a separate 65-seat bar that spills out into the lobby and includes an open 12-foot fireplace . Diners can look through it and see the hotel entrance and cascading fountains beyond , creating a symbolic vision of fire and water . <p> It 's an inspired and innovative design that echoes the demeanor of the food . Nothing is forced , although the menu flows freely between cultures . One course may call for sake and another for wine , but the interface is seamless and the wine list is diverse enough to cover the entire spectrum . <p> Seven offerings from the sashimi bar solidify the theme . The combinations may have a Latin twist in items such as ceviche with bird's-eye chile and watermelon radishes ( $14 ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ponzu ( $16 ) . <p> Sone shows a creative California flair with " Lissa 's Staff Meal " ( $18 ) , clearly demonstrating there 's much more to sashimi than knowing how to slice raw fish . The chef makes " noodles " out of long chewy strips of cuttlefish and mounds them in the center of a burnished origami-like bowl with a julienne of daikon , burdock root stained orange to look like carrots , precise rounds of sliced okra , orange salmon eggs and sea urchin . A quail egg , held upright by a dab of wasabi , is meant to be blended with the fiery condiment , poured over ingredients and tossed . The seductively slick okra , the silky slip of egg and the velvety but chewy texture of the fish play beautifully against the crunch of vegetables . Although there 's a lot going on , each flavor is distinctive , revealing a true artistry . <p> Other raw offerings include poke ( $15 ) with ogo seaweed , and Italian crudo ( $16.50 ) made with fluke on our visit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lemon , sea salt and a splash of extra virgin Leccino olive oil . <p> The appetizer menu has similar cross-cultural guideposts , including creamy burrata ( $14 ) , a soft mozzarella-like cheese showcased with olive oil-braised artichokes and a frilly corsage of variegated radicchio that adds pleasant bitterness . The dish is pulled together with garum , an Italian fish sauce that adds a magical dash of the complex savoriness called umami . <p> Sone 's Japanese heritage comes to the forefront with chawan mushi ( $17 ) , a traditional Japanese egg custard that he dresses up with Maine lobster , sea urchin and mitsuba sauce made from the Japanese herb . <p> Appetizers are rounded out with a warming soup of white beans ( $12.50 )  --  <p> half pureed and half left whole  --  garnished with rings of chewy calamari and a pool of tapenade ; octopus carpaccio ( $15 ) , with thin rounds fanned around fingerling potato salad , caper berries and lemon aioli ; and a creamy fricassee of oysters ( $16 ) in a beurre blanc sauce with leeks and mushrooms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book as one of the top tastes of the year . <p> In a gentle twist on tradition , Dunmore and Sone stuff confit of duck into ravioli ( $15.50 ) served with a silken giblet sauce punctuated with chunks of chanterelles and dark gauzy bits of water spinach , akin to incorporating the haunting sounds of a Japanese stringed instrument in a traditional Western symphony . <p> For main courses , the sake-marinated Alaskan black cod on shrimp dumplings in a shiso broth ( $29.50 ) has become so entrenched at Terra that Sone was obligated to put it on the menu at Ame . It 's no concession because it 's stunning in taste and appearance , looking like a fanciful lily pond with the fish poised in the middle surrounded by flower-shaped carrots , shiitake mushrooms and shisho leaves . <p> A grilled pork chop ( $32 ) , as tender and rich as Kobe beef , is poised atop halves of baby turnips , beets and other root vegetables , and generously dotted with the mustard seeds from the verjus sauce . I also adored the lightness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( $28.50 ) modestly presented on a bed of braised cabbage with coins of potatoes , dices of bacon and earthy trumpet mushrooms . <p> On the other extreme , the chefs pair eel and foie gras in a velvety sauce ( $34 ) , creating a voluptuous combination served on already rich matsutake mushroom risotto . <p> Desserts have a whimsical bent , and also hopscotch the globe . A thick , almost pudding-like cup of pleasantly bitter hot chocolate is served with three warm sugar-dusted churros ( $9.50 ) ; a homey pear crisp comes with a buttery pecan streusel crowned with a scoop of gingersnap ice cream ; and warm chocolate cake is topped with a lush hot fudge sauce . The cake may be ubiquitous , but the unexpected addition of chiles , and a side of red beet ice cream , makes it distinctive . <p> The sophisticated sensibilities of the food present some challenges in service . Should the staff be formal or casual ? How much explanation should each dish get ? These are questions the staff is still trying to answer . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convivial spirit permeates the place , but at times the servers can be annoying . One time we got a running commentary on the dishes our server would order , how quickly we ate our crudo , and the fact that we switched plates and shared tastes . Another time the server continually barged into our conversations rather than alerting us of his presence before he spoke . <p> At other , less-ambitious places these idiosyncrasies would be easily overlooked , but at Ame the setting is so refined and the food so pristine that the service needs to be like a ballet . Not pretentious or formal , but coolly accessible . <p> After dining at Ame , I feel both energized and calm . It 's like a walk in a Japanese garden  --  you appreciate the vast effort that has gone into shaping the environment , but it feels completely natural and restorative . <p> Good finds , bargains on Ame 's global wine list <p> Lissa Doumani and Anani Lawson have compiled a wine list at Ame that 's every bit as sophisticated as the menu . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glass or bottle , are all well balanced , obviously chosen to go with the food . <p> The well-priced offerings span the globe . Budget-conscious diners can find some interesting selections under $30 , such as the 2003 Dutton Goldfield Gewurztraminer ( $26 ) and the 2001 Nerleux " Clos des Chatains " ( $25 ) , a red wine from Saumur in the Loire Valley . For those wanting to splurge , there 's the practically impossible-to-find 2003 Grace Family Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon ( $522 ) . <p> In just about every category you 'll find wines that other restaurants ca n't get , such as seven vintages of Dunn Cabernet Sauvignon in the " Older California Red " category . <p> Still , I love the " Other European Reds " and the " Other European Whites , " which feature selections such as the 2004 Andrea Oberto Barbera d'Alba ( $27 ) . <p> In addition , there 's a carefully chosen half-bottle list  --  check out the 2001 Lail " J. Daniel Cuvee " Cabernet Sauvignon ( $80 )  --  and 21 wines by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ margarita with Herradura Silver Tequila is $12 and a blood orange cocktail with Grey Goose vodka is $14 . <p> If you bring your own wine , corkage is $20 . <p>  --  M.B. <p> CHART : <p> Ame 689 Mission St. ( at Third Street , in the St. Regis Hotel ) , San Francisco ; ( 415 ) 284-4040 .
