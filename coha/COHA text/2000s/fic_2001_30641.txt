Through the darkness the man moved from tree to tree , working his way toward the large house . The nineteenth-century estate , forty miles south of Hamburg , Germany , spanned one hundred and twelve acres of beautiful rolling forest and farmland and was designed after the Grand Trianon at Versailles in France . It had been commissioned by Heinrich Hagenmiller in 1872 to win further favor with William I of Prussia , the newly crowned German emperor . Portions of it had been sold off over the years as it became too expensive to maintain so much land . The man walking silently through the woods had already studied hundreds of photographs of the property and its owner . Some of the photos were snapped from satellites orbiting the earth thousands of miles up , but most were taken by the surveillance team that had been in place for the last week . The assassin had arrived from America only this afternoon and wanted to see with his own eyes what he was up against . Photographs were a good start , but they were no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his black leather jacket was flipped up around his neck to ward off the bite of the cold fall evening . The temperature had dropped twenty degrees since sunset . For the second time since leaving the cottage , he stopped dead in his tracks and listened . He thought he had heard something behind him . The narrow path he trod was covered with a fresh bed of golden pine needles . It was a cloudy night , and with the thick canopy above , very little light reached the place where he stood . He moved to the path 's edge and slowly looked back . Without his night-vision scope , he could see no more than ten feet . Mitch Rapp had been trying not to use the scope . He wanted to make sure he could find his way down the path without it , but something was telling him he was n't alone . Rapp extracted a 9-mm Glock automatic from his pocket and quietly screwed a suppresser onto the end of it . Then he grabbed a four-inch tubular pocket scope , flipped the operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye . The path before him was instantly illuminated with a strange green light . Rapp scanned the area , checking not only the path but his flanks . The pocket scope penetrated the dark shadows that his eyes could not . He paid particular attention to the base of the trees that bordered the path . He was looking for the telltale shoe of someone who was seeking to conceal himself . After five minutes of patiently waiting , Rapp began to wonder if it was n't a deer or some other creature that had made the noise . After five more minutes , he reluctantly gave in to the conclusion that he had heard an animal of the four-legged variety rather than two- . Rapp put the pocket scope away but decided to keep his gun out . He had not made it to the ripe old age of thirty-two by being careless and sloppy . Like any true professional , he knew when the time was right to take chances and when to cut and run . Rapp continued down the path for another quarter of a mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead and decided to go the rest of the way through the underbrush . Silently , he maneuvered through the thickets , bending branches out of his way and ducking under others . As he approached the edge of the forest , he heard the snap of a twig under his foot and quickly moved to his left , placing a tree directly between himself and the house . A kennel of hunting dogs , not more than a hundred yards away , erupted in alarm . Rapp silently swore at himself and remained perfectly still . This was why he needed to check things out on his own . Amazingly , no one had told him that there were dogs . The canines grew louder , their barks turning to howls , and then a door opened . A deep voice yelled in German for the beasts to be quiet . The man repeated himself two more times , and finally the dogs settled . Rapp slid an eye out from behind the tree and looked at the kennel . The hunting dogs were wired , pacing back and forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as trained guard dogs , but their senses were still naturally keen . He stood at the edge of the forest listening and watching , taking everything in . He did n't like what he saw . There was a lot of open space between the forest and the house . There were some gardens that he could weave his way through , but it would be hard to stay silent on the paths of crushed rock . The dogs would make approaching from the south very difficult . Surveillance cameras covered the other avenues , and there was twice the open space to traverse . The only good news was that there were no pressure pads , microwave beams , or motion sensors to deal with . Officially , Mitch Rapp had nothing to do with the U.S. government . Unofficially , he had been working for the CIA since graduating from Syracuse University more than a decade ago . Rapp had been selected to join a highly secretive counterterrorism group known as the Orion Team . The CIA had honed Rapp 's raw athleticism and intelligence into a lethal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him knew him as a successful entrepreneur who had started a small computer consulting business that required frequent travel . To keep things legitimate , Rapp often did conduct business while abroad , but not on this trip . He had been sent to kill a man . A man who had already been warned twice . Rapp studied the area for almost thirty minutes . When he had seen enough , he started back , but not down the path . If someone was in the woods , there was no sense in walking right into a trap . Rapp quietly picked his way through the underbrush for several hundred yards to the south . He stopped three times and checked his compass to make sure he was headed in the right direction . From the intelligence summary , he knew there was another footpath due south of the one he had come in on . Both paths entered the estate from a narrow dirt road and ran roughly parallel to each other . Rapp almost missed the second footpath . It appeared less frequented than the first one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the curving dirt road . When he reached it , he knelt down and extracted his pocket scope . For several minutes he scanned the road and listened . When he was sure no one else was about , he began walking south . Rapp had been doing this for almost ten years , and he was ready to get out . In fact , this probably would be his last job . He had met the right woman the previous spring , and it was time to settle down . The CIA did not want to let him go , but that was tough . He had already given enough . Ten years of doing what he did for a living was a lifetime . He was lucky to be getting out in one piece and with a marginally sound mind . A little more than a mile down the road , Rapp came upon a small cottage . The shades were drawn , and smoke drifted from the chimney . He approached the door , knocked twice , paused for a second , and then knocked three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye appeared . When the man saw that it was Rapp , he opened the door all the way . Mitch stepped into the sparsely furnished room and began to unbutton his leather jacket . The man who had let him in locked the door behind him . The cottage had knotty pine walls that had been painted white and three-inch plank floorboards that were covered with shiny green paint . Brightly colored oval throw rugs were scattered about the floor , and the furniture was old and solid . The walls were adorned with local folk art and some old black-and-white photographs . Under normal circumstances it would be a great place to spend a cozy fall weekend reading a good book by the fire and taking long walks through the forest . At the kitchen table a woman sat wearing headphones . On the table in front of her was about a quarter of a million dollars in high-tech surveillance equipment . All of the gear was contained in two beat-up black Samsonite suitcases . If anyone were to stop by the cottage , the cases could be closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never met the man and woman before . He knew them only as Tom and Jane Hoffman . They were in their mid-forties , and as far as Rapp could tell , they were married . The Hoffmans had stopped in two countries before arriving in Frankfurt . Their tickets had been purchased under assumed names with matching credit cards and passports provided by their contact . They were also given their standard fee of ten thousand dollars for a week 's work , paid up-front in cash . They were told someone would be joining them and , as always , not to ask any questions . All of their equipment was waiting for them when they arrived at the cottage , and they started right in on the surveillance of the estate and its owner . Several days after arriving at the cottage , they were paid a visit by a man known to them only as the professor . They were given an additional twenty-five thousand dollars and were told they would receive another twenty-five thousand dollars when they completed the mission . He had given them a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did not tell them the man 's real name , only that he was extremely competent . Tom Hoffman poured Rapp a cup of coffee and brought it to him by the roaring fieldstone fireplace . " So , what 'd ya think ? " Rapp shrugged his shoulders and looked at Hoffman 's face . His complexion was neutral , not flushed like Rapp 's from being out in the cold night air . In response to the question , he said , " It 's not going to be easy . " Rapp had already checked the woman 's face and shoes . Neither of these people had been outside . It must have been a deer that he had heard in the woods . " It rarely is , " noted the stocky Hoffman , who took a drink from his own mug once again while trying to get a read on the stranger before him . The six-foot-one muscular man whom he knew only as Carl moved like a big catsoft on his feet . There was nothing clumsy about him . His face was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jet-black hair was thick and just starting to gray around the temples , and there was a thin scar on his cheek that ran from his ear down to his jaw . Rapp looked away from Hoffman and into the fire . He knew he was being sized up . Mitch had already done the same with both of them and would continue to do so up until the moment they parted . He looked back into the fire and focused on the plan . He knew the tendency in these situations was to try to come up with something that was truly ingenious  --  a plan that would bypass all of the security and get him in and out without being noticed . This was not necessarily a bad path to take if you had enough time to prepare , but as of right now they had about twenty-three hours to draw the whole thing up and pull it off . With that in mind , Rapp had already begun thinking of a strategy . Turning away from the fire , he asked the woman , " Jane , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " About fifty . " Rapp ran a hand through his black hair , grabbed the back of his neck , and squeezed . After staring into the fire for a long moment , he announced , " I have an idea . " The first signs of morning were showing in the east . The black sky was turning gray , and patches of fog wafted from ponds as the cool fall air mixed with summer 's leftover warmth . The pristine Maryland morning was interrupted by a dull thumping noise in the distance . Two Marines walking patrol on the Jeep road by the west fence instinctively searched for the source of the sound . With M-16s slung over their shoulders , they craned their necks skyward , both knowing what was approaching without having to see it . Within seconds they also knew it was n't a military bird . The telltale thumping was far too quiet . The white helicopter buzzed in over the trees and headed for the interior of the camp . The Marines followed it for a second and then continued with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the president 's golf partners . The Bell JetRanger continued on an easterly heading toward the camp 's water tower . Just in front of the tower was a clearing with a cement landing pad . The bird slowed and floated smoothly toward the ground , its struts coming to rest right on the mark . The pilot shut the turbine engine down , and the rotors began to lose momentum . A black Suburban was parked on the nearby road , and several men in dark suits and ties stood by watching as the visitor stepped out of the helicopter . Dr. Irene Kennedy grabbed her briefcase and headed for the truck . Her shoulder-length brown hair was pulled back in a ponytail , and she was wearing a crisp blue shirt . Kennedy clutched the lapels of her tan suit against the cool air . When she reached the Suburban , an army officer extended his hand . " Welcome to Camp David , Dr. Kennedy . " The forty-year-old employee of the Central Intelligence Agency took the officer 's hand and said , " Thank you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the CIA 's Counterterrorism Center . Unofficially , she headed up the Orion Team , an organization born in secrecy out of a need to go on the offensive against terrorism . In the early eighties the United States was stung hard by a slew of terrorist attacks , most notably the bombing of the U.S. embassy and Marine barracks in Beirut . Despite the millions of dollars and assets allocated to fight terrorism , after the attacks , things only got worse . The decade ended with the downing of Pan Am Flight 103 and the deaths of hundreds of innocent civilians . The Lockerbie disaster moved some of the most powerful individuals in Washington to take drastic measures . They agreed it was time to take the war to the terrorists . The first option of diplomacy was n't doing the job , and the second option of military force was ill suited to fight an enemy that lived and worked among innocent civilians , so America 's leaders were left with only one choice : the third option . Covert action would be taken . Money would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light of day , much less congressional oversight or the scrutiny of the press . A clandestine war would be mounted , and the hunters would become the hunted . The ride took just a few minutes , and no one spoke . When they arrived at Aspen Lodge , Kennedy got out and walked up the porch steps , past two Secret Service agents , and into the president 's quarters . The colonel escorted Kennedy down the hall to the president 's study and knocked on the open door frame . " Mr. President , Dr. Kennedy is here . " President Robert Xavier Hayes sat behind his desk sipping a cup of coffee and reading Friday morning 's edition of the Washington Post . A pair of black-rimmed reading spectacles sat perched on the end of his nose , and when Kennedy entered he looked up from the print and over the top of his cheaters . Hayes immediately closed the paper and said , " Thank you , Colonel . " He then rose from his chair and walked over to a small circular table where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his morning golf match , wearing a pair of khaki pants , a plain blue golf shirt , and a pullover vest . He set his mug down on the table and poured a second cup for Kennedy . After placing it in front of her , he sat and asked , " How is Director Stansfield ? " " He 's ... " Kennedy grasped to come up with the appropriate word to describe her boss 's failing health , " as well as could be expected . " Hayes nodded . Thomas Stansfield was a very private man . He had been with the CIA from its very inception , and it appeared he would be with it to the very end of his own life . The seventy-nine-year-old spymaster had just been diagnosed with cancer , and the doctors were giving him less than six months . The president turned his attention to the more immediate matter . " How are things proceeding in Germany ? " " On track . Mitch arrived last night and gave me a full report before I left this morning . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the week , the one thing Hayes had made crystal-clear was that there would be no green light unless Rapp was involved . The closed meeting between the president and Kennedy was one of many they had had in the last five months , all in an effort to harass , frustrate , destabilize , and , if possible , kill one person . That fortunate individual was Saddam Hussein . Long before President Hayes had taken office , Saddam was a source of irritation to the West , but more recently he had done something that directly affected the fifty-eight-year-old president of the United States . The previous spring , a group of terrorists had attacked the White House and killed dozens of Secret Service agents and several civilians . In the midst of the attack , President Hayes was evacuated to his underground bunker , where he sat for the next three days , cut off from the rest of his government . The siege was ended , thanks to the bold actions of Mitch Rapp and a few select members of the intelligence , law enforcement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States was left with two pieces of information that pointed to the Iraqi leader . There was a problem , however , with bringing this information to the United Nations or the international courts . The first piece of evidence was obtained from a foreign intelligence service that was none too eager to have its methods exposed to international scrutiny , and the second was gathered through the use of covert action  --  the third option . How that information was extracted would be deemed reprehensible by all but a few . In short , they had some very reliable information that Saddam had funded the terrorists , but they could never make the facts public because that would expose their own methods . And as President Hayes had already noted to an inner circle of advisors , there was no guarantee the UN would do anything once it was confronted with the facts . After intense debate by President Hayes , Director Stansfield of the CIA , and General Flood , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs , the three had decided they had little choice but to go after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's what this meeting was all about . President Hayes leaned forward and placed his coffee mug on the table . He was eager to hear Rapp 's take on the situation in Germany . Hayes had discovered that where others failed , Rapp had a way of making things happen . " What does Mitch think ? " " He thinks that given the short notice and the security around the target , we would be better off opting for a more direct approach . " Kennedy went on to give the president a brief overview of the plan . When she was finished Hayes sat back and folded his arms across his chest , his expression thoughtful . Kennedy watched him and kept her own expression neutral , just as her boss would do . Hayes mulled things over for another ten seconds and then said , " What if they did it ... " The president stopped because Kennedy was already shaking her head . " Mitch does n't respond well to advice given from three thousand miles away . " The president nodded . After the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on Rapp . It was almost always his way or the highway , and while this could be a concern , one could hardly argue with the man 's record of success . He had a history of getting the job done , often when no one else even dared to take it . Hayes suppressed his urge to be an armchair quarterback and instead decided to remind Kennedy of what was at stake . " Do Mitch and the others know they are on their own ? " Kennedy nodded . " I mean really on their own . If anything goes wrong , we will deny any knowledge of the situation and of who they are . We have to . Our relationship with Germany could not withstand something like this , nor , for that matter , could my presidency . " Kennedy nodded understandingly . " Sir , Mitch is good . He 'll have all of his backups in place by this evening , and if things get too tight , he knows not to force it . " The president stared at her for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have my authority to go ahead with this , but you know where we stand , Irene . If it blows up , we never had this meeting , and we did n't have the five or six meetings before , either . You had no knowledge of these events , and neither did anyone else at the Agency . " Hayes shook his head . " I hate to do this to Mitch , but there 's no choice . He is way out there working without a net , and if he falls , we ca n't do a thing to help him . "
