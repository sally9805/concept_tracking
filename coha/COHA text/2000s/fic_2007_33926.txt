Blaze by Richard Bachman Foreword by Stephen King Full Disclosure Dear Constant Reader , This is a trunk novel , okay ? I want you to know that while you 've still got your sales slip and before you drip something like gravy or ice cream on it , and thus make it difficult or impossible to return . It 's a revised and updated trunk novel , but that does n't change the basic fact . The Bachman name is on it because it 's the last novel from 1966-1973 , which was that gentleman 's period of greatest productivity . During those years I was actually two men . It was Stephen King who wrote ( and sold ) horror stories to raunchy skin-mags like Cavalier and Adam , but it was Bachman who wrote a series of novels that did n't sell to anybody . These included Rage , The Long Walk , Roadwork , and The Running Man . All four were published as paperback originals . Blaze was the last of those early novels ... the fifth quarter , if you like . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you insist . It was written in late 1972 and early 1973 . I thought it was great while I was writing it , and crap when I read it over . My recollection is that I never showed it to a single publisher  --  not even Doubleday , where I had made a friend named William G.Thompson . Bill was the guy who would later discover John Grisham , and it was Bill who contracted for the book following Blaze , a twisted but fairly entertaining tale of prom-night in central Maine . I forgot about Blaze for a few years . Then , after the other early Bachmans had been published , I took it out and looked it over . After reading the first twenty pages or so , I decided my first judgment had been correct , and returned it to purdah . I thought the writing was okay , but the story reminded me of something Oscar Wilde once said . He claimed it was impossible to read " The Little Match Girl " without weeping copious tears of laughter . So Blaze was forgotten , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some corner of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine with the rest of their Stephen King/Richard Bachman stuff . Blaze ended up spending the next thirty years in the dark . And then I published a slim paperback original called The Colorado Kid with an imprint called Hard Case Crime . This line of books , the brainchild of a very smart and very cool fellow named Charles Ardai , was dedicated to reviving old " noir " and hardboiled paperback crime novels , and publishing new ones . The Kid was decidedly softboiled , but Charles decided to publish it anyway , with one of those great old paperback covers . The whole project was a blast ... except for the slow royalty payments . About a year later , I thought maybe I 'd like to go the Hard Case route again , possibly with something that had a harder edge . My thoughts turned to Blaze for the first time in years , but trailing along behind came that damned Oscar Wilde quote about " The Little Match Girl . " The Blaze I remembered was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I decided it would n't hurt to look . If , that was , the book could even be found . I remembered the carton , and I remembered the squarish type-face ( my wife Tabitha 's old college typewriter , an impossible-to-kill Olivetti portable ) , but I had no idea what had become of the manuscript that was supposedly inside the carton . For all I knew , it was gone , baby , gone . It was n't . Marsha , one of my two valuable assistants , found it in the Fogler Library . She would not trust me with the original manuscript ( I , uh , lose things ) , but she made a Xerox . I must have been using a next-door-to-dead typewriter ribbon when I composed Blaze , because the copy was barely legible , and the notes in the margins were little more than blurs . Still , I sat down with it and began to read , ready to suffer the pangs of embarrassment only one 's younger , smart-assier self can provide . But I thought it was pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the time , considered mainstream American fiction . It just was n't a noir novel . It was , rather , a stab at the sort of naturalism-with-crime that James M. Cain and Horace McCoy practiced in the thirties . I thought the flashbacks were actually better than the front-story . They reminded me of James T. Farrell 's Young Lonigan trilogy and the forgotten ( but tasty ) Gas-House McGinty . Sure , it was the three Ps in places , but it had been written by a young man ( I was twenty-five ) who was convinced he was WRITING FOR THE AGES . I thought Blaze could be re-written and published without too much embarrassment , but it was probably wrong for Hard Case Crime . It was , in a sense , not a crime novel at all . I thought it could be a minor tragedy of the underclass , if the re-writing was ruthless . To that end , I adopted the flat , dry tones which the best noir fiction seems to have , even using a type-font called American Typewriter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked fast , never looking ahead or back , wanting also to capture the headlong drive of those books ( I 'm thinking more of Jim Thompson and Richard Stark here than I am of Cain , McCoy , or Farrell ) . I thought I would do my revisions at the end , with a pencil , rather than editing in the computer , as is now fashionable . If the book was going to be a throwback , I wanted to play into that rather than shying away from it . I also determined to strip all the sentiment I could from the writing itself , wanted the finished book to be as stark as an empty house without even a rug on the floor . My mother would have said " I wanted its bare face hanging out . " Only the reader will be able to judge if I succeeded . If it matters to you ( it should n't  --  hopefully you came for a good story , and hopefully you will get one ) , any royalties or subsidiary income generated by Blaze will go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freelance artists who are down on their luck . One other thing , I guess , while I 've got you by the lapel . I tried to keep the Blaze time-frame as vague as possible , so it would n't seem too dated . It was impossible to take out all the dated material , however ; keeping some of it was important to the plot . If you think of this story 's time-frame as " America , Not All That Long Ago , " I think you 'll be okay . May I close by circling back to where I started ? This is an old novel , but I believe I was wrong in my initial assessment that it was a bad novel . You may disagree ... but " The Little Match Girl " it ai n't . As always , Constant Reader , I wish you well , I thank you for reading this story , and I hope you enjoy it . I wo n't say I hope you mist up a little , but  - -  Yeah . Yeah , I will say that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stephen King ( for Richard Bachman ) Sarasota , Florida January 30th , 2007
