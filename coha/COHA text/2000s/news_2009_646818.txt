Though the long-running NBC drama finally checks out Thursday ( 9 ET/PT ) , it leaves a lasting , indelible impression not only on its viewers over the 15 seasons , but also on its cast and crew . A selection of special memories and observations : <p> Opening the floodgates <p> " Hell and High Water " was a multiple ER highlight . <p> The second-season story , which featured a heroic effort by Dr. Doug Ross ( George Clooney ) to save a boy caught in a flooded culvert , " was the first time we really went outside of the ER in a really physical , muscular show , " director Christopher Chulack says . " It was an undertaking we were n't used to . A lot of it was George running around with the kid in the rain . That was a little risky , but it worked , and it got everybody a lot of attention . " <p> It certainly did , to the tune of a series-record 48 million viewers . " It was one of the most memorable episodes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always talking about it . " <p> Movie executives at Warner Bros. , home to ER 's Stage 11 set , must have been talking , too , from what Clooney told Chulack . " The next day , ( they ) came to George 's trailer and asked him to be Batman . " <p> All in the ( saline ) bag <p> Illness was n't always just fictional on the ER set . During the " Love 's Labor Lost " episode , Noah Wyle was reeling from mononucleosis and a high fever . So he saw a doctor : Joe Sachs , the medical technical adviser who became an executive producer . <p> " I said , ' Joe , I do n't think I 'm going to make it . You 've got to give me something , " Wyle says . " He looked around the set and said , ' I guess I could hook you up to an IV . I said , ' Do it , and he put the needle in my arm and the saline bag in my lab coat pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say ' cut , and I 'd hang the bag on a hook and hydrate . " <p> It worked  --  to unexpected dramatic effect . " It pulled my fever down to a place where I could focus , " Wyle says . " I look feverish , when you look at it ( now ) . I look very dramatic , my response to the whole thing . Ca n't say that it 's all acting . " <p> A medical education <p> With medical personnel on staff , the entertainment had nutritional value . " They would purposely give story lines to things that were current in the world of medicine . They were dramatic but also almost an educational format for people , to get a certain test or be tested for HIV or if there was a new drug on the market , " Innes says . <p> Character relationships were clearly central , but the medicine played a larger role than it had on many medical shows , Visnjic says . " I definitely think it was a breakthrough . " <p> In Season 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greene ( Anthony Edwards ) saves a baby but loses the mother to a condition unfamiliar to many viewers . " The day after , every OB-GYN in the country got a call from clients ( asking ) , ' What the hell is pre-eclampsia ? " Wyle says . <p> The Africa stories stood out for Dr. Kovac character <p> Wyle , executive producer Christopher Chulack and Goran Visnjic ( Dr. Luka Kovac ) each cite " Kisangani " as a favorite episode . <p> The Season 9 finale , with Season 10 follow-up " The Lost , " used Hawaii as a stand-in for Africa , where Carter joined Kovac at a medical clinic . <p> " We were off the continent on an island in the South Pacific doing an episode of ER . It was exciting , " says Chulack , who directed both episodes . It also opened the door to later foreign forays to South Africa , playing the role of Darfur , and Paris . <p> " The Africa stories for the Kovac character were kind of the culmination of his fight with faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wife during the war back in Croatia , " Visnjic says . <p> The setting " was pretty much jungle . It looked very much different from Stage 11 , where we normally shoot . ( The characters ) had no technical apparatus . <p> Surgery was done with a regular saw and a little betadine , no anesthesia . Everything was kind of different , but it was still ER . " <p> In between the two episodes , Kovac was presumed dead . " I had this thing about being at my own funeral . It was kind of cool , " Visnjic says . " ( Executive producers ) David Zabel and John Wells wrote those two episodes and , in my opinion , that was the best work they 've done for TV . " <p> With so many episodes to choose from , Wells put others on his favorites list when ER hit 300 episodes : " Love 's Labor Lost , " " On the Beach , " " Time of Death , " Season 1 's " Blizzard , " which gave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Season 7 's " Rescue Me , " which had " wonderful scenes " between Abby and her bipolar mom ( Sally Field ) . <p> Using a crutch in real life <p> The role of Dr. Kerry Weaver ( Laura Innes ) came with a cuff crutch when producers decided to give the character a disability . They did n't specify Weaver 's condition ( years later identified as degenerative hip dysplasia ) , so Innes worked with a physical therapist and a doctor who has polio , observing the latter 's gait . <p> Innes , who at the time lived near the canals in Venice , Calif. , would put her son to bed at night , then go out and practice walking with the crutch . Maura Tierney , who had yet to take the role of Abby Lockhart , lived nearby and would see her walking . <p> " Years later , when Maura and I became friends , she said , ' Oh , my God , I used to see you out there in the dark walking around , and I used to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actress from ER is just walking around , lonely , in the canals , " says Innes , who ranks second to Wyle in episodes . <p> Dr. Romano reveals his soft side <p> Dr. Robert " Rocket " Romano , the obnoxious , brilliant surgeon , had a rare human moment viewers may have missed when he signed a message to the hearing-impaired young son of Dr. Peter Benton ( Eriq La Salle ) , says Paul McCrane , who flew Rocket from guest star to recurring role to series regular . <p> " It was never explained , never subtitled . I just loved that , " McCrane says . " I do n't think I 've ever told anybody this . What he signed to him was , ' Take care of your father . That 's a great little moment that you never see from Romano . " <p> Romano 's demise hardly had that degree of subtlety . A helicopter blade severed his arm , leaving him unable to operate . Another chopper took his life , crashing on him in County General 's ambulance bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems , " says McCrane , who , like acting colleague Innes , also has directed a number of ER episodes . <p> " I ca n't say I was thrilled , " he says , " because the idea of a one-armed surgeon seemed like it could n't go all that far . " <p> Innes , McCrane behind the camera <p> Apparently , producers did n't have it in for McCrane , since he continued to direct ER episodes after poor Romano was pulverized . <p> " It was hands-down my favorite place to direct , probably in part because it 's where I started , but also because it was such a well-oiled machine , " says McCrane , who directed two episodes in the last season . " Right through to the end  --  people were feeling nervous and sad about going out of business , so to speak  --  everybody still brought it . Everybody still came with their game . " <p> Directing ER is both " very fun and very hard , " Innes says . A director must get through 10 or 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six or seven of some other shows , because of the fast pace and so much overlapping and connecting dialogue between the many characters , she says . <p> The complexity increases with the technical details of the medicine , vetted by the show 's doctors , and the special effects , which might include a rig for a heart spurting blood , Innes says . <p> " I think it would be very interesting for the audience to see everything that goes into it , " she says . <p> Find Documents with Similar Topics Help Below are concepts discussed in this document .
