Eight-year-old Hannah McGoey lives in an upstairs apartment on a busy thoroughfare in London . She has no yard to play in , and her school holds physical-education classes just two days a week . Her busy parents tried to be careful about nutrition , giving up their Friday fish and chips , for example . But over the years , Hannah only became plumper . By the time she turned 6 , children 's sizes no longer fit her . " I would have to buy jeans for 12- and 14-year-olds , " her mother Julia remembers , " and then cut a foot and a half off the leg . " <P> But things began to change when a school nurse told the McGoeys about a program called MEND ( mind , exercise , nutrition , diet ) , started by Paul Sacher , a dietitian at London 's Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children . Hannah enrolled last September , and by the time the program ended 10 weeks later , she had shed nearly 5 lbs . and grown more than an inch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , Hannah , who is now 4 ft. 11 in. tall and weighs 84 lbs. , brims with confidence and loves physical activity . " I did n't swim much before , " she says . " Now I go swimming once a week . " <P> Hannah McGoey , unfortunately , is a rare exception to what is rapidly becoming a global epidemic of childhood obesity . More and more countries around the world  --  even some that have been struggling to prevent starvation  --  are now wrestling with the dangers of excessive nutrition . The U.S. continues to lead the way , with as many as 37% of its children and adolescents carrying around too much fat . But other countries are rapidly catching up . According to statistics presented recently at the European Congress on Obesity in Helsinki , Finland , more than 20% of European youngsters between the ages of 5 and 17 are either overweight or obese . Children in North Africa and the Middle East are n't far behind . Across Asia too , childhood obesity is on the rise , and the trend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> " These figures should set alarm bells ringing in ministries of health across the developed and developing world , " says Tim Lobstein , co-editor of a forthcoming report to the World Health Organization on childhood obesity . And with good reason : people who are obese as children have a high risk of becoming obese adults  --  meaning they will have a much higher risk than their slender counterparts of contracting a broad range of debilitating diseases , including heart disease , hypertension , diabetes and cancer . The surge of obesity among children , in short , presages a global explosion of illnesses that will drain economies , create enormous suffering and cause millions of premature deaths . " This is a true health-care crisis , " says Robert Lustig , a pediatric endocrinologist at the University of California , San Francisco , far bigger than severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) and ultimately , he thinks , even bigger than AIDS.
