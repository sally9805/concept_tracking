After a late night , New York City college student Dave Hearns and his friends do n't count on coffee for a quick perk-up the next morning . Instead they slurp cans of energy drinks like New York Minute , a caffeine-infused beverage that smacks of sweet cherries . " I do n't like the taste of coffee , " says Hearns . " This wakes me up more . " He says this even though New York Minute , like most energy drinks , contains up to a third less caffeine than a cup of coffee . <P> Hearns and his friends are not alone : a 2001 survey found that 22% of college students were buying energy drinks . The drinks are the fastest growing sector in the beverage business . After earning a mere $12 million in 1997 , they now account for $1 billion of the $60 billion U.S. soft-drink market . Red Bull was the energy-drink pioneer , and still commands a share of more than 60% , but there are more than 200 challengers to the throne , many of which have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drinks , in both their sweet taste and their ingredients ( caffeine , fructose and taurine , a nonessential amino acid , are among the most common ) . They also share a penchant for aggressive , alpha-male names like Rockstar ( which tastes like fizzy bubble gum ) , Venom ( with a citrus bite ) , Blue Ox , Monster , Hype , " bone-crushing citrus " Piranha , Stinger and Whoop Ass . <P> The drinks are n't exactly health food , but if you 're looking for a quick buzz , they will do little harm  --  as long as you chase them with enough water . All that caffeine can be dehydrating.
