Judith Moffett 's first stories of the Hefn invasion were assembled into the novel The Ragged World , which was followed by another novel , Time , Like an Ever-Rolling Stream . Her most recent story in the series was " The Bear 's Baby " in our Oct/Nov 2003 issue . These days , Ms. Moffett divides hei time between Swarthmore , PA , and a hill farm in Kentucky . She says she has finished up work on a third Hefn novel ( of which this story forms a part ) and she is now writing and publishing more poetry again . For this stoiy , Ms. Moffett is grateful to Polly Schaafsma , and to Solveig A. Tuipin and Jim Zintgiaff , whose written and photographic work on Pecos Rivei iock ait weie of great help . 1 EVEN AT THE END OF MAY you could find snow in the Wasatch Range of Utah if you went high enough - snow on the ground , snow occasionally falling from the sky . Pam Pruitt stood behind one of the cameramen and watched a group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wooden wheels screeched on wooden axles . Neil Reeder , a handsome teen in a tattered coat and britches , with a rag tied over his head and ears , was pushing a cart from behind while a man and woman strained backwards as they pulled on the handle . Snow swirled around them . As he passed the camera Neil looked directly into the lens , face contorted with effort and determination , heavy shoes slipping on the icy stones . The next instant a wheel came off the cart and Neil , with a startled yelp , went sprawling . " Cut ! " the director yelled . " We 'll do one more take , folks . Dave , move that mark two feet downhill , I want Neil to release the wheel a little sooner . " The actors trooped back down the slope while props people reattached the wheel and rolled the carts down . Neil saw Pam standing with Lexi Allred , his costar in the series they were filming , and waved . Pam and Lexi waved back . " Places , everybody . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Neil nodded . The director called " Ready ? Roll " em . And - action ! " And the Ephremite pioneers began again to toil up the mountainside , pulling and pushing their handcarts toward the New Jerusalem and the cameras . Pam glanced sideways at Lexi , eleven years old and in a peck of trouble . Lexi , radiantly beautiful even in that getup , stood clutching a silvery emergency blanket over her long dress and shawls . Feeling Pam 's regard upon her , she looked up and smiled , and Pam smiled back . This time the director was satisfied with the broken wheel and the actors regrouped to begin a different scene . " I 'm in this one , " Lexi said . She gave the emergency blanket to Pam . Walking to join the others , she lifted her shawls and redraped them so they covered her head as well as her shoulders . Pam shook out and folded up the blanket , and handed it to RoLayne Allred , who had come to stand beside her . " Can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before they finish the scene . " " Fine , " said Lexi 's mother . She half-looked at Pam as she tucked the blanket under her arm , a look of mingled resentment and shame . Years of being Liaison Officer for Child Oversight in Utah had conditioned Pam to ignore such looks . Lowering her voice , keeping it friendly , she said " How do you feel she 's doing ? " " She seems to be doing all right . " " Have you talked about it with her much ? " " That counselor you 're making her see is the one she talks to , " Lexi 's mother said , and this time the resentment was unmistakable . Pam counted to ten before replying , with a kindness that was at least partly genuine , " She feels bad about getting her granddad in trouble , you know - she feels like the abuse was her fault somehow , that 's very common . You could help with that , RoLayne . I know it would be a huge relief to her if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did the right thing to turn him in . " The director called for action and they watched Lexi struggle up a different slope ( with less trampled snow ) at the front of a group of shawled women , heads bowed against the wind and swirling flakes . The ablebodied women were helping haul the carts ; these , as Pam and RoLayne could see , in front of them and on the monitor screen , were all too old , young , pregnant , or enfeebled to do more than totter along behind . Where the ascent was less steep , some would ride . It was n't a scene where the onlookers had to keep completely quiet , and Lexi 's mother murmured , " Well , I ca n't very well say what I do n't believe . " Pam murmured back , " That she was right to tell ? But surely - " " Tell you Gaians . I do n't think that was right myself , so you need n't expect me to say it was . " Pam gritted her teeth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us she was being molested , or told her Canon , or her parents , than that she told somebody . " When Mrs. Allred did n't reply , Pam gestured up the slope and led her companion farther from the microphones . In a normal voice she said , " Kids often feel guilty at the commotion it causes when they report abuse . That 's why it 's so vital that they be reassured by the people they love and trust the most . Lexi really needs to hear that it 's not her fault people are so upset , and she needs to hear it from you . " " Tell her yourself , " RoLayne said shortly . " I 've already given her my opinion , which is that she should 've come to the Canon and let him talk to her grandfather . In the Ephremite Church even children have a responsibility to put the good of the Church ahead of their own good . " She flashed Pam a look of pure hostility . " I do n't expect you to understand that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - her grandfather and the Canon are old friends , " Pam said , still hanging on to her reasonable tone , which was getting harder to do , " so you could n't really expect her to go to him about this . " " What I expect her to do , " said RoLayne , " is her moral duty . I 'll tell you one thing I do know . I know whose fault it is that she 'll have nothing to do with the Church anymore , since you Gaians got ahold of her . " " That 's a wrap ! " the director called . " Good job , everybody . Take ten . Neil , I need you for a sec . " The group of toiling women broke formation and headed for the hotdrinks trailer , and Lexi , seeing her mother and Pam standing together , ran over to them . RoLayne shook out the silver blanket . As she wrapped it around her daughter , Lexi said , " Mom , could you fix this ? I stepped on it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her tattered dress with both hands . RoLayne examined the hem . " Oh , I think so . Let 's go see if we ca n't find a needle and thread . " She slipped an arm around Lexi 's shoulders and propelled her toward the props trailer . Pam she ignored . Lexi , however , turned inside her mother 's half-hug to look back at Pam . " We 'll be done pretty soon . I 'm still coming home with you , right ? " " Right . I can wait , there 's no hurry . " " Is Humphrey still hibernating ? " " Yep . It 'll just be us tonight for dinner , but I got out another cobbler anyway . " Lexi beamed - she knew blackberry cobbler was the Hefn Humphrey 's favorite food on earth - and turned away . RoLayne 's stiff back spoke volumes , but there was nothing she could do . Pam felt a twinge of sympathy . Only a twinge , though . If there was one thing she could not abide , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the expense of her child 's well-being . Apart from RoLayne , Pam enjoyed these visits to Lexi on location . Ephremite history fascinated her . Founded by a visionary and led for decades by a genius-level businessman , the Church of Ephrem the Prophet was a purely American product . Early persecution , climaxing in martyrdom , had united and empowered the Ephremites as a people set apart . They established a kingdom in a desert , and the kingdom thrived . Deprivations ? Plagues of locusts ? Military occupation ? Mass arrests and jailings ? They rose above it all ; their indomitability kept pace with their suffering . A mulish determination to triumph over adversity seemed hardwired into the collective Ephremite psyche . As a people they were tough as nails , and the toughness had survived into modern times . The more Pam learned about them , the more she admired them for it . But child sexual abuse had long been a special problem among the Ephremites ; and - as with the Catholic Church - a powerful , patriarchal , t self-protective governing authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ephremite community was deeply family-centered , with many children and lots of activities organized for them . All those Scout troops needed leaders . If you were a good God-fearing Ephremite pedophile , you had no trouble finding victims , in or out of your own family , and nothing much to prevent you , or help you if you wanted to stop . Every Ephremite male was inducted into the Meshak Priesthood when he turned eighteen . For children raised to believe that members of a Priesthood held a God-given authority over them , disobedience was not an easy option . What Lexi had done by exposing her grandfather had taken more nerve than anyone unaware of all this could possibly appreciate . The Ephremite Church 's way of dealing with the problem was to encourage repentance and forgiveness , to counsel wives that the main thing was to keep the family together and that kids needed their father at home . A perpetrator 's local Church authority , his Canon , would explain - and honestly believe - that pedophilia was basically a moral problem , that could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assigning all child-abuse cases to the Gaians worked a lot better than prayer and repentance did . But the Ephremite leadership hierarchy , stripped of authority where certain of their members were concerned , could perhaps not be expected to feel very grateful . 2 WHEN THE MYSTERIOUS and powerful Hefn had arrived on Earth , they 'd been horrified to discover a sentient species there , busily destroying its own biosphere . Taking charge , they 'd set out at once to reverse the damage . They imposed sweeping reforms on agriculture , transportation , and manufacturing ; they established the Baby Ban , mass infertility brought about by mass hypnotic suggestion . Also , one Hefn - Humphrey - set up the Bureau of Temporal Physics , where young math intuitives , known as Apprentices , were trained to operate alien devices that could be used to locate the placetimes in human prehistory where people had once lived in harmony with their world . The Bureau 's findings had launched the Gaian Movement , with its mission of converting humanity to values that could help heal the Earth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved choosing a piece of land as a personal Ground , and developing an intimate relationship with that Ground over time , a process called " living into " the land . That part of Gaian teachings had appealed to Lexi enormously ; it was largely because of it that she 'd fled to the Salt Lake Gaian Mission a little more than three months before . But now Lexi and Pam were sitting on Pam 's back porch steps before dinner , feeding lumps of dry dog food soaked in water to the juvenile robins Pam had been rehabbing for the Salt Lake Aviary . And Pam was explaining that the Gaians had decided to change their focus . " You 're supposed to think about your family2 . " Lexi asked dubiously . " Mm-hm . Where they came from , where they live now . Like , all the Ephremite families that settled the Great Basin and made the desert blossom as the rose . " She pulled a wad of dog food in half and fed the halves to a badly banged-up robin she called Gimpy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Your family was part of that , right ? Here , Greedy Guts . " Pam poked a piece of food into Wingy , who gulped it down . Behind the garden , seven mallard ducklings splashed and squeaked in their plastic wading pool . " On my dad 's side . Mom 's relatives came from Denmark later on . My dad 's **53;3551;TOOLONG came with a wagon train . They 've got it all written down in a book at home . " They would ; Ephremite genealogical resources were the best in the world . " But they 've lived in Utah a long time . " " Yeah . Mostly . When did you say you were getting back from your trip ? " Pam suppressed a sigh . " It 's only just over this weekend , sweetie . I 'll be back on Monday . " Lexi had been told this several times , but anxiety made her keep asking ; she did n't want Pam to leave Salt Lake . " I really do have to go , Humphrey 's orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's the new term we 're using , but I 'll be back before you know it . " Lexi kept her eyes on the wet lump of kibble she was squeezing . Pam said brightly , " I was thinking today , up on location , that acting in A Thousand Miles is a terrific way to focus on the country that means the most to you and your family - I mean your whole family , Lexi , I 'm not counting your granddad . You and Neil really know what a high price the first settlers paid to get here , and how important that makes this land to their descendants - it 's theii Homeland , see ? " The soggy lumps were disappearing fast . Pesky hopped onto Lexi 's knee , and Lexi , delighted , fed him a lump herself . She did n't push it far enough down his throat , but he threw his head back and managed to swallow it anyway . " Good ! " said Pam . " Try to stick it a little farther in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change it . I know Humphrey said the old way did n't get enough converts . But I liked it better . " Stuffed , the robins withdrew . Pam snapped the lid back on the kibble soaker , a margarine tub from Landfill Plastics , and smiled at Lexi . " Tell you the truth , I did too , but Humphrey and the missionaries think more people can relate to what the Gaians are saying if we do it like this , through family ties to land that 's been lived into for a long time , so the land and the people really belong to each other . Like , you know ... getting together at Christmas with all your relatives at the old home place , the special feeling you get from that . " Seeing the child frown , Pam wondered what feelings she had just conjured up , and added hastily , " But anybody who wants to can still go the old way and choose a personal Ground . We 're trying to bring more people in , not push anybody out . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , keep on with your Ground in Kentucky ? " " Actually , in my case Homeland wo n't make that much difference , " Pam said . " I was a grounded Gaian steward long before we decided to change our approach . But it can be good to go at things from more than one direction . " She grabbed the tub of kibble , stood , and smiled down at Lexi , sitting on the step still looking worried . " So what about your dinner , are you hungry yet ? " Lexi got up slowly . " It wo n't make any difference in my case either , the Homeland thing wo n't . I 'm sticking with The Secret Garden . Like when Mary Lennox says " Might I have a bit of earth ? " - like that . " She spoke the line , in Mary 's British accent , with a wistful hopefulness so utterly convincing that Pam shivered . She put her hand on Lexi 's shoulder and squeezed . " You be Gaia 's actor , kiddo . Anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When they broke for lunch on the first day of the conference , Pam went back to her room and checked her messages : a brief one from her deputy , Jaime Rivera , that boiled down to " Everything 's under control " ; an even briefer one from Lexi in a tattered sun bonnet , evidently sent on a break between scenes : " Hi , sorry to bother you on your trip but could you please call me right away ? " Oh , Lexi . Yawning hugely - none of the conferees had gotten much sleep - Pam pushed the recall button . The face that flickered onto the screen was that of Marcee Morgenstern , producer of A Thousand Miles . " Hi , " said Pam . " I 'm returning a call from Lexi . " " From Lexi ? Lexi 's gone AWOL ! " Marcee looked angry and flustered . " You say you 're returning a call ? When was this ? What did she say ? " Wide awake now , Pam checked the readout . " Looks like . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm in California at a conference , I left my phone in my room this morning , only found out she 'd tried to reach me a few minutes ago . She just said to call her . What do you mean by AWOL ? " " She finished her last scene and I sent her to get out of makeup . About twenty minutes later here 's RoLayne having hysterics , where 's Lexi , has anybody seen Lexi . Which nobody had - including makeup , she never showed up over there . We all dropped everything to look for her , but so far no luck . I 'm going to tan her bottom when we get ahold of her , this has played holy heck with the schedule and we were already a day behind - " She was going to do no such thing , but Pam understood how she felt . " How long have you been looking ? " " I do n't know , an hour maybe , or a little less . " " An hour ? " Pam relaxed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went for a walk . " Marcee glared . " She 's under strict orders not to wander off , remember2 " Pam herself had given those strict orders when the abuse had been reported . " Yes , of course she is , I 'm sorry . " " Nobody 's got a clue where she could have gone . " Marcee 's voice slid up dangerously . " And J have n't got a clue how she managed to slip off , there are people everywhere up here keeping an eye on her ! " A pang of real alarm shot through Pam . " Okay , I 'll notify my office . If she does n't turn up soon we 'll bring in the police . " " If she calls you again - " " I 'll handle it . Let me know the minute you find her , okay ? " The instant she hung up , something very peculiar happened ; Pam could feel her consciousness expand and zoom in , like a powerful microscope , on the details of Lexi 's situation . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one of two things had certainly happened : either Church authorities had snatched Lexi , or she 'd run away to escape being snatched by Church authorities . Her mind was astounded at its own failure to see this coming . The Ephremite leadership had agents everywhere , they knew the Hem had summoned the Apprentices and the Gaian leadership to a conference ; obviously they would not have been slow to seize their moment . When things abruptly shifted back to normal , Pam managed to stay focused , disoriented and freaked out though she was . Were people holding Lexi , or was she all by herself somewhere up Emigration Canyon , scared to death ? A kidnapping , if that 's what it was , had the earmarks of an inside job . She thought a minute , then punched her phone . When Humphrey answered she said simply , " I have to go home . Lexi 's disappeared and I 'm as sure as I can be that the Ephremites are behind it . They 've been raising Cain about Gaians having jurisdiction in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should make the 13:58 express . " " They do this always , raise the Cain ? " He meant , whenever Child Welfare Oversight took custody of an Ephremite child , which happened several times a year . " They do , but this kid 's famous , it 's giving them a big public black eye . And there 's something else - something happened , I had this very weird mental experience ... I 'll tell you later , but now I really need to go . " The Hefn 's tiny likeness stared at her from the phone : great opaque eyes , face covered with short , gray hair , full gray beard . Pam said , " Humphrey , this is extremely important . I ca n't explain how I know that , but it is . " Surprisingly , he did n't argue , only said soberly , " When we have finished here , I will come to Salt Lake if you have not found Lexi . I would like very much to hear more about the weird experience . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it if you could interview her mother . " Probe her twisted little mind , she meant . " But do please come either way . " He made his neckless imitation of a nod . " I have said so . " " Good luck then . I would n't leave for any other reason , " Pam said , and cut the connection . Then she called Jaime . 3 THE SLEDCAR had been fitted with hard rubber tires for summer , which made for a bumpy ride . Barefoot , in her raggedy dress , Lexi sat shoved up against the car 's passenger door , as far away from her grandfather as the seat belt would let her get . She was trying not to make a sound as they jounced along , but her makeup was streaked with tears . Her grandfather , Edgar Carstairs , was making the sledcar labor up the mountain at its top speed - not that fast but still way too fast for the condition of the road . Both of them kept being thrown around , but Lexi had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind her with a leather boot lace . Granpa 's face wore a funny look of grim satisfaction . Once he and RoLayne had got Lexi bundled into the car , he 'd paid no attention to her , except that when she had asked - careful not to sound panicky - " What 's happening ? Where are we going ? " he stopped the car just long enough to pull her arms behind her and whip the thong around her wrists . " That 's in case you should take a notion to jump out , " he said . " We 're going someplace no Hefn and no Hefn-lovers would ever think to look . And by the way , " he added in a mean voice , " do n't you worry about me lovin " on you anymore . The very idea of lovin " on a little brat that would go and tattle to the Gaians makes me sick . " He whirled on her suddenly . " You ought to be ashamed ! Embarrassing me , that 's bad enough - do you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But slinging mud at the Church , now , that 's beyond anything . " Granpa looked a little crazy while making this speech , glaring at Lexi , spit spraying , face working . The car lurched wildly . She shrank away from him in fear . Also in guilt . Despite what the counselor kept telling her , and what Pam and her dad had told her , Ephremite conditioning went bonedeep with Lexi . They ground along in silence for a while . Finally she asked timidly , " Do Mom and Dad know where you 're taking me ? " Granpa smirked . " Your mom knows where I told her I was taking you , but that 's not where we 're going . And your dad , he 's a know-nothin " from the word go . Now I want you to sit still and shut your mouth . " This was a side of Granpa Lexi had never seen , or even consciously suspected . All her life he had treated her like a princess , in a kind of artificial , saccharine way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark . She had dreaded spending time with him alone , but she had n't exactly been terrified , like afraid for her life . But this crazy-seeming stranger frightened her so much it was hard to think . The one hopeful thing was . that she 'd left the message for Pam after catching a glimpse of her Granpa , who was n't allowed to be anywhere around her right now , through the window in the wardrobe trailer bathroom . She 'd come out , gone straight to the phone , and made the call , reluctant somehow to say in her message what she was calling about . Then it was time to do a scene , and then another scene that had required multiple takes , and after that Marcee said she was done for the day . Lexi 'd been on her way to get out of makeup when her mother , sounding happy and excited , had called to her to come and look at something out behind the trailer . By that time she 'd forgotten about Granpa , and that was when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her into the car . " Mom ! " she pleaded when she 'd been strapped in and the blanket came off . RoLayne looked over her shoulder furtively . " Honey , everything 's fine , do n't worry . Just mind Granpa , do what he tells you . I 'll see you real soon . " She squeezed Lexi 's arm through the car window , and they started moving . Remembering all this gave Lexi an idea , something to grab onto mentally in the dizzying terror . " I have to go to the bathroom , " she said in a whiny voice . He 'd called her a brat , okay , she 'd play a brat . " Then I guess you 'll just have to hold it . " He sounded calmer now . He did n't take his eyes off the road . " No , I really have to go bad , " she said in a shrill , complaining voice . A little more nasal quality ? Maybe just a little . " I already had to go when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gon na wet my pantsl " " I told you to shut up , " he snapped , but he looked uneasy all the same . He must have borrowed the sledcar , and what sledcar owner was going to be thrilled to find the seat had been peed on ? Things seemed to be taking a promising turn , but just then Lexi realized that even if she prevailed , Granpa was n't going to untie her hands and let her go off into the bushes on her own . He would keep hold of her , and pull her dress up and her pants down himself . He 'd claimed that the thought of " loving on her " made him sick , but what if getting into that kind of situation made him change his mind ? Lexi felt a thrill of a sicker sort of fear . " I guess I can wait a little while , " she said in a sulky voice . " You do that , " said her grandfather , though he looked over at her in a way that made Lexi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that much fu'ther anyways . " " But this leather thing 's really hurting my hands , they 're getting numb . " " Like I said , it 's not much fu'ther . " At that moment the sound of a helicopter made Lexi 's heart leap with hope . Pam might have returned her call by now ; by now , everyone would realize she was missing . Maybe that Jaime at Gaian headquarters had called the Salt Lake Police . The only choppers allowed in the air were official ones . The police were probably hunting for her right this minute . She strained around , trying to see , just as the racket got much louder and the chopper suddenly appeared from behind the slope of a mountain . It was n't a police helicopter after all . The lettering on the side said the church of EPHREM THE PROPHET . As she was realizing this , Lexi also realized that Granpa was looking up with interest , not concern . In fact the chopper was landing behind some trees above the road , and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abandoned picnic sites that used to be popular back when people could take private cars up into the canyons east of Salt Lake . Lexi 's heart plummeted . This was n't rescue , this was rendezvous . Granpa was handing her over to the Church . He had n't kidnapped her for some reason of her mother 's and his own , he 'd done it with the cooperation , maybe even on the orders , of the Church leadership . Her grandfather quieted the car and came around to pull Lexi out . " Up there , " he said tersely , and started pushing her ahead of him , up a trail that wound among derelict picnic tables set on terraces . The trail went pretty much straight up the side of the steep canyon . Granpa had to stop partway to catch his breath , holding onto Lexi 's arm and bending over to pant . She could probably have wrenched herself loose while he was preoccupied with panting , but there was n't much point , the terrain was way too rough and her bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over rough ground while the cameras rolled , would slow her down , even if she could keep her balance with her buzzing hands tied behind her . She would never get away . " If you untied me I could walk by myself , " she said anyway . " Do n't make me laugh , " he growled . They started up again . Lexi expected to see Sire Cooper , but the person standing by the chopper was the Canon of her own Parcel , the one who was Granpa 's friend , the one who always used to say how wonderful it was that their Parcel had a real family with a real testimony . Canon Erickson gave Lexi a big smile , then frowned when he saw that her hands were tied . " Was it necessary to truss her up like that , Ed ? " " Trust me , " Granpa puffed , very red in the face . " It was necessary . The kid can run like a rabbit . " Canon Erickson leaned over Lexi 's bonds . He tsked sympathetically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right cheek , already streaked with actual tears . " Oh dear , it 's digging into her skin , look . Jared , " he said , turning to a person inside the chopper , " will you take a knife and cut this child 's hands free ? " " At least put her in there first and lock the doors , " Granpa said . " You do n't know her like I do , Carl . " The Canon nodded . " All right , Lexi , up you go . " The man called Jared swung to the ground , picked her up like a sack of flour , and boosted her onto the helicopter behind the pilot . He climbed in after her and opened a clasp knife , and Lexi 's hands were free . Numb as they were , if she 'd still been on the ground she 'd have been off like a streak of lightning , Granpa was right . Vividly she saw herself squirm into a hidey-hole in the rocks and crouch low while they lumbered past , kicking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would tear strips from the dress to wrap and tie around her feet , make a little shelter , stay cleverly hidden until Jaime or Pam could spring into action . There were serviceberries in the mountains this time of year , and plenty of water . She had perfect faith that eventually Pam would save her . All she would have to do would be not get caught until that happened . But it was all useless , she was sealed inside the helicopter and the pilot was making the rotors roar . Aboard the bullet train from L.A. to Las Vegas and Salt Lake , Pam sat at a table in the concessions car , sipping cider and alternately fretting and scheming . The Nevada desert slipped drearily past her window . If Lexi was alone in the mountains , she had to be found at once . If the Ephremites were holding her - and this seemed likelier - there was no need to be concerned about her physical safety ; but the Church would work on her to renounce the Gaians , and otherwise try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider a great PR coup if they could bring it off . Fiercely Pam determined not to let Lexi be put through deprogramming . She intended to find her fast , with Humphrey 's help if necessary . And from now on , however often she would have to encounter the odious RoLayne , Pam intended to play a more active role in Lexi 's life . The world as they knew it might be on the verge of changing for everybody , but this one child was not going to be forced to live in constant fear of having her private world turned inside out like a sock if Pam could help it . As if activated by these thoughts , the TV screen above the forward door of the car crackle-flickered to life - and Pam gasped and half-rose , for there stood Lexi herself , in her Kate dress and sun bonnet and bare feet , arms folded across her chest , looking proud and defiant despite her streaky makeup . As Pam sank back in her seat , a news announcer began reading a report : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the popular television series A Thousand Miles , was kidnapped earlier today by agents of the Church of Ephrem the Prophet , commonly known as the Ephremite Church . " The network received this recording an hour ago from a spokesperson for the Church , which is claiming credit for liberating Alexis from what they term " the corrupting influence of the Gaian Movement . " Church agents are holding the girl in an undisclosed location and demanding that the Hefn agree to release her officially into Ephremite custody . Here is the actual recording received by this station . " The still image of Lexi on the screen now began to move . Someone said , in a voice Pam did n't recognize , " Lexi , go ahead now , honey , tell the folks you 're all right . " The girl glared at the camera and lifted her chin , and Pam 's insides weakened at this show of courage . Lexi might be intimidated , even scared to death , but - professional to the core - she was n't going to let it show . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you herself , but as you can see she 's absolutely fine , if a little mad at us right now . We 're going to take wonderful care of her . But we 're going to keep her tucked away till the Hefn agree to restore her to us for safekeeping , away from the corrupting influence of the Gaian Movement . This child was a wonderful Ephremite girl until just a few months ago , when the Gaians got hold of her and brainwashed her into believing their lies . " So now , while we 're waiting to hear what the Hefn have to say , we 'll also be trying our best to undo the evil visited upon this innocent child . Every single child is precious to us , all the more precious now that the aliens have stolen away a whole generation of our children . " All the time the unseen speaker was holding forth , Lexi stood very still but her mobile face expertly conveyed her disdain . ( " Precious my foot ... what a load of crapola. . . you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " ) Pam was so proud of her that her eyes prickled . " We ask for your prayers and support as we endeavor to force these evil creatures to renounce the crime they committed against humanity a generation ago . We demand that they restore our ability to obey the commandment God first gave to Adam and Eve : that they be fruitful , and multiply , and replenish the Earth . " The newscaster 's face replaced Lexi 's on the screen . " CBC has learned that six months ago , the Gaian Mission in Salt Lake City filed a complaint against Alexis Allred 's grandfather , on a charge of sexual abuse of a minor . The grandfather , Edgar Carstairs , is a member of the Ephremite Church and a direct descendent of the Prophet Ephrem Carstairs . Since allegations were filed against Mr. Carstairs , Alexis has been under Gaian oversight . A Thousand Miles , which is financed and produced by the Ephremite Church , was filming on location in the Wasatch Mountains east of Salt Lake when the child was abducted. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into New Jerusalem Square . The light-rail system , TRAX , had stopped running at 11:00 , but a few horse cars were still parked at the curb . Pam shouldered her pack , climbed the stairs to the street . Office or home ? Home first , then office ? Or vice versa ? She dithered , staring up at the Ephremite angel , Fortibus , guyed atop the tallest spire of the Cathedral opposite the station . The Gaians would need to put a public face on their efforts to find Lexi . It would be best to get a statement out tonight . Office then . Pam hailed a horse cab and climbed in . The night air was delightful ; the driver had folded down the top of his cab . As the horse began to clomp forward on its rubber shoes , Pam sat back and studied the angel , bathed in fight high above the darker streets . Despite his winglessness he did appear to be in flight , as the figurehead of a ship appears to fly above the waves . From the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to see where Lexi was being hidden . The great slab of the Ephremite Office Building dwarfed the Cathedral , spire and all ; if they were holding her there - a good possibility - then Lexi might be able to look down on the angel from above . Supposing they ever let her near a window . " Where to , lady ? " said the driver , who sounded Latino . " The Gaian Mission on Fourth South . " He whistled . " Would n't go nowheres near that place if I was you . " " Just take me there , okay ? " Inside the Mission , lamps were lit . Good , dear , faithful , dependable Jaime . Pam climbed out and paid the driver , who got his first good look at her under the street light . " Oh , hokay , you that lady that works for them Hefn . Workin " late tonight , tryin " to fin " that little girl on the telly , now Iget it . " Pam hurried up the walk . Jaime jerked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thank God you 're back . " " I 'm mighty glad to see you too . " She shrugged off her pack and collapsed on the couch beside it . " I saw the recording on the train . What have you found out ? " " Not a freakin " thing ! I called the cops right after I talked with you , and they started out looking , but the minute they found out who it was that had her , that was the end of that . The Church is zipped up tight on this one , I worked through the whole fist of contacts and nothing , not a peep , nobody 's talking . " Jaime blew through his lips in frustration . " Want some tea ? Cider ? " " Thanks , but I rode all the way back in the caf car . " Pam rubbed her ey es . " There may only bea handful of people who actually know anything . You have to give them credit , the ones involved are putting their lives on the line . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does n't go their way . Ephremites have never been cowards about their convictions . " " Yeah , well , I think it 's pretty cowardly to kidnap a little girl and use her as a hostage , " Jaime muttered . " How are the Hefn gon na respond ? " " I doubt they 'll respond at all , actually , they 're more likely to just act like nothing happened . Or no , " she said , " Humphrey 's fond of Lexi , he wo n't leave her in the clutches of the Church . He 's coming out in a couple of days . If we have n't found her by then , he 'll get out of " em where she is , and not by negotiating either . " " Well , I 'd a hell of a lot rather not wait that long . " Pam nodded . " They 'll take care of her , and she wo n't crack , at least not right away , but she 'll be counting on me to get her out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - I 'm with you , I do n't want to wait for Humphrey , let 's find her now . " Despite these words Pam yawned and stretched , pulling herself almost horizontal on the couch . " So , do we issue a statement ? " " We do . That 's why I came here straight from the station . " Pam heaved herself up and trudged into her office . " Computer on . " She plunked into her desk chair . " I like what you said before . How 's this : " Abducting a child to use as a bargaining chip is a cowardly deed . The Ephremite Church , whose history is filled with acts of sacrifice and courage , has betrayed herself today . ' " Jaime dispatched this to the Salt Lake Tribune and CBC , then left to bicycle the half mile home . Pam had intended to go home as well , but the couch in her office suddenly seemed to sing a siren song . She scrounged her toothbrush out of her luggage , washed the sunblock off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She slept heavily , done in by the past couple of days . Dream fragments came , went , came again . At dawn , weightless in the pure light , she stood transfixed upon the tallest spire of the New Jerusalem Cathedral and beheld the burning sliver of the sun poised to lift above the Wasatch Range . Birds came to her : finches , sparrows , robins and mallards she had raised or nursed and released , all shining , whirling about her head . Gimpy swooped in and hovered at arm 's length before her face , wings beating , strong and whole ; and as she stretched forth a finger to touch the russet feathers of her breast the realization struck home : I 'm dreaming ! I 'm having a lucid dream ! She had read about this but never experienced it . In a lucid dream you 're aware that you 're dreaming , you can take the dream wherever you like . I 'll find out where they 're keeping Lexi ! she thought at once , and , spreading her wings wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up by the spirafing flock of ducks and songbirds , Pam circled high over the city . Show me where Lexi is ! she commanded , and was immediately soaring south , the Great Salt Lake to her right and rear , the Wasatch Range and the sunrise to her left . The birds flew with her - silent , even the mallards , except for the stroking of their wings . All together they swept past Point of the Mountain and flew over Orem and then Provo , the silver tracks of TRAX flashing far below . They went like the wind . The birds stopped weaving in the air and settled into a mixed flock with Pam at the center , holding a flat smooth trajectory , higher and far faster than natural birds can fly . / hope I do n't wake up before we get there , she thought ; but the landscape streamed beneath her and the dream went on . Pinned to the wall of the office where Pam 's body lay asleep was a huge relief map of Utah . Now this map lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she was being guided . Above Spanish Fork , with the tip of Utah Lake in view , the flock turned east of south , leaving the shiny rail tracks and the Salt Lake Valley behind . The terrain abruptly changed ; they broke out of the peaks , and now beneath them deep meandering canyons cut through scrubbly mountains , where dark green vegetation grew thickly scattered against a ground of red and yellow-tan . A road wound through and they followed that , flying high and fast . Clustered buildings - Price ? - flashed by . They were moving even faster now , veering south again , and now the land-map lost definition in a long broad valley vaguely and distantly flanked by ranges , and Pam was aware of little but dizzying speed and the energy of the birds , bearing her up , sweeping her along . Till suddenly there was the tiny twist of a river dead ahead , dirty green within the wrinkled flatness of the valley , and they were speeding down , down , down , circling , swooping low above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water to a wider road , a long low building , a child looking up , holding her left hand high in the Gaian salute . Pam gasped awake . Her legs swung off the couch by themselves , rushed her to the wall and the relief map . " Lights ! " Her head was clear as a bell , but she had to prop herself with both hands on the wall while she made sure . Then she pushed off and spoke to the phone . " How fast can you get over here ? " Pam said , when Jaime 's puffy , stubbly face appeared onscreen . " I know where she is ! " " Green River ? " He peered at the map doubtfully . " How would they get her there from Emigration Canyon ? We 'd know if they 'd taken out their chopper after the news release . They have n't . They probably ca n't . " " No , they 'll lose their chopper now . TRAX to Salina , then overland ? " " Overland how ? By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they snatched her . " Jaime rubbed bis face , making a raspy sound . " They could put a Church car on the train without attracting attention , I guess , they do that all the time , but - look , Boss , tell me again about this dream ? " Pam said , " No matter how many times I tell it , it 's not going to sound any more reasonable . I ca n't even be sure it was a dream . I was sound asleep , but . . . listen , we can talk about it later but right now we have to get down to Green River . Humor me , Jaime . I know that 's where she is , even if I ca n't explain how I know . " Unhappy but resigned , he grumbled , " I 'll go along , but I got ta say , it 's not like you to do things that do n't make sense . " " I know it 's not . I agree with every word you 've said so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Okay . Here 's what we do . We call down to Moab and have Harley send some people up there . " After Salt Lake , the principal Gaian Mission in Utah was in Moab , not far beyond Green River but farther than Pam had flown in her dream . " That 's brilliant ! Thank God one of us still has their wits about them . Better not mention the dream thing , say we 've had a tip , and to check out all the motels that have rows of rooms on one level . Probably an older motel , maybe abandoned . " " Phone on , " yelled Jaime , striding toward his own office . " And tell him to be careful ! The Church has staked an awful lot on this . " Jaime sat at his desk and punched a key . " People go back and forth all the time between Green River and Moab on the old rail fine through Crescent Junction , " he called to Pam . " We can have a posse up there by lunchtime - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The problem was an incoming call from Santa Barbara . " If that 's Humphrey , put it through to my office . " She went in and shut the door , and there on the screen was her favorite Hefn 's familiar face , all beard and fuzz . Seeing it , Pam realized she had totally forgotten about the conf er : enee and its urgent business ; but this had priority now . " Okay if I call you back in five minutes ? We 're sending out some people to pick up Lexi and we need to get hold of them . " " Lexi has been found ? " " Not yet , but we think we know where she is . I 'll explain when I call you back . " " Explain when you see me , " said Humphrey , " this evening . I am coming to Salt Lake , as we agreed . " Pam said , " Look , that 's great , but I may be tied up with this rescue . You might want to wait a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not want to wait a day or two . If you are not at home I will let myself in and wait for you , or I will come and find you . " He was telling , not asking ; Pam had to acquiesce . While Jaime called Moab , she stared soberly at the blank screen . But then she heard Harley Kroupa 's voice describing how he would organize and move his troops , and rushed into Jaime 's office to urge , " Be careful ! Do n't you guys get captured or we 'll have to bust you out of there too . " " You sure they 've got her in Green River ? Seems like a funny place to pick . " Jaime started to answer but Pam said firmly , " That 's what we hear . No guarantees , but it 's our best lead , and if there 's any chance at all - " " Gotcha . We 'll do our damnedest . An old motel , they said , just a strip of rooms like a train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . Kind of big . " " Might be any of a bunch of " em . Well , those ones are all on East Main , we 'll stake " em all out . " " Great . If you can bring her back as far as Salina , we 'll meet you there . There 's a train in an hour and a half . " Jaime cut the connection and swiveled in his chair to look up at Pam . " We 'll meet you ? " " I will , then . You do n't need to come , O thou of little faith ; I know you think it 's a wild goose chase . You stay and mind the store . " Her own words made her shiver . A wild goose chase indeed . 5 LEXI CAME OUT OF the little bathroom of the swaying bus and made her way back to her place behind the driver , holding onto the other seats to keep her balance . She was no longer in her Thousand Miles getup . Back in the huge bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd shot that viddy , she had scrubbed off her makeup and changed into her own jeans , T-shirt , socks , and sneakers . Her mother had put these items in a bag for Granpa , and Granpa had given the bag to the Canon after they 'd hauled her into the helicopter . There was a sweatshirt too , but she 'd taken that off . Even with all the windows open it was warm on the bus . She 'd been sleeping with the seat tilted back as far as it would go , and felt dopey and strange , and now she was hungry . She glanced across the aisle at the young man - Jared - who 'd been in the chopper with Canon Erickson , and who 'd bundled her onto the train at Midvale while everybody looked the other way . He was reading , a book that looked like The Sayings of Ephrem . It went against the grain to ask a kidnapper for any favors , but the more she thought about food the harder it got not to . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring any food on this getaway bus , " in haughty , disdainful tones , when Jared closed his book , stretched , looked over at Lexi , and said , " How about something to eat ? " " You do n't mean to say you actually brought any food on this getaway bus , " Lexi said in her best withering voice , hoping her relief did n't show . He grinned . " Sure did . Let 's see here . " He got up and opened the lid of a cooler on the seat behind him . " Ham and Swiss with lettuce and mayo ? Coke ? " When she nodded he handed her a sandwich wrapped in wax paper , and a green bottle , then took another sandwich and bottle for himself and slid back into his seat . Except for the driver , they had the whole big bus to themselves , a shockingly unGaian waste of resources . Lexi could n't remember getting off TRAX and boarding the bus ; she 'd slept right through the whole thing and had been sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roared along through the dark . I bet they drugged me , she thought darkly . She 'd had tomato soup and a grilled cheese sandwich for dinner on the train . I bet they put ground-up sleeping pills in that soup . So I wouldn " t yell and give them away when we switched to the bus . I would have , too , I would 've yelled my head off ! Now it was morning . They were deep in mountains Lexi did n't recognize , heading toward the sun . She unwrapped the sandwich avidly , wondering who had made it , and twisted the cap off the Coke bottle with caffeine free stamped in raised letters right in the glass . The sandwich was heavenly ; Lexi tried not to wolf it but she pretty much did . The Coke was cold and delicious . " Want a cookie ? " Jared held a round tin box across the aisle . " Oatmeal raisin ? " The cookie was extremely good . Lexi ate several more cookies and started to feel a lot better . Cookie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . She stared out the window , wondering where the heck they were taking her . It could n't hurt to ask . " Where are we going ? " she asked above the roaring of the motor . " Sorry . Ca n't tell you that . " Jared smiled when he said this , but Lexi could tell he was n't going to budge . Would he maybe relent and tell if she sobbed and begged him and acted distraught ? After watching her gobble a sandwich and seven cookies ? Not likely . Time dragged by , and they were still on the mountain road , not going very fast . She could n't deduce anything from looking out the windows except that the road was in good shape , so this was a regular bus route , not an unmaintained highway that carried no traffic . Once in a while a vehicle - an ambulance , a recycling lorry , another bus - would pass them going the opposite direction , but all were unrevealing except for the bus , which said salt lake express on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road signs had long since rusted over or disappeared from their posts . Nobody had replaced them . In a world where private cars were forbidden , what was the point of signs ? Lexi leaned her head against the window and thought about Pam . If Pam had been in Salt Lake , instead of Santa Barbara , her mom would never have dared get involved in the kidnapping , not in a million years . Thinking about how her mom had helped Granpa shove her into the sledcar , Lexi 's eyes filled up ; but she blinked hard and swallowed , and decided to be mad at Pam instead . Pam had no business going to California ! Pam was supposed to stay here , making sure stuff like this did n't happen , that was her job ! Righteous indignation swelled Lexi 's chest . She thought about the scathing things she would say to Pam after Pam had rescued her from the kidnappers - I 'm not speaking to you ! - and how sorry Pam would be , how she would apologize over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of thought was deeply satisfying , for a while ; but then Lexi remembered sitting at Pam 's kitchen table with Pam and Humphrey , all three with big plates of spaghetti in front of them and big red circles around their mouths , and how Humphrey had talked about what Pam used to be like when she first went to the Bureau of Temporal Physics as a kid not much older than Lexi herself , the be , the first Apprentice to learn how to place the numbers in the time transceiver fields , how she used her mind to do this with such beautiful precision . Lexi had seen Pam watching Humphrey while he was explaining all this , she knew what that look meant . Pam loved that weird-looking , hairy old Hefn . When Humphrey ordered her to go somewhere , she had to go . That was her job too , doing what Humphrey said . The swaying of the bus was making Lexi drowsy . In spite of herself she dozed off again . Then it was later , and the bus had slowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drab-colored flat-topped mountains under puffy , flat-bottomed white clouds . They were coming into a town . Jared had moved over next to her , and one of his big hands had a grip on the back of her neck , - that was what had woken her . " Stay right like you are , Alexis . I do n't want to hurt you but I will if you try to yell or signal out the window . " Saying this , he pushed her head down nearly to her knees and ducked down beside her . Grinding its gears , the bus moved slowly through the town . From her bent-over position Lexi could n't see out at all . Being pressed down made her panicky ; her heart thumped while she desperately willed herself not to struggle . If she gave in to the panic and started to fight Jared , whose hard breathing was a rasp in her right ear , he would hurt her . He had said he would , and she believed him . After a few minutes the bus turned right , into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , then stopped . Jared sat up cautiously and looked out , then took his hand off Lexi 's neck . " Okay , Alexis , we 're getting off now . Now , what I 'm gon na do is , is I 'm gon na hold your hands behind your back . Now , do n't you make one sound , okay ? Not one single sound . Just do like I tell you and you 'll be fine . Okay , come on . " He pulled her up and clamped her again , gripping both her wrists together in the same hand that had held her face to her knees . " Ow ! " she said - though it was more uncomfortable than painful to be held that way - but all he did was clamp her tighter and hiss : " What did I tell youl Not one sound , not a one ! Now get going . " He thrust her ahead of him to the front of the bus and down the steep steps . Through the windows she could see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings . As Lexi stepped the last high step down to the ground , she caught a glimpse of deep blue sky and tall pink cliffs that did look a little bit familiar , and thought , I bet we 're somewhere near the parks . The driver had maneuvered the bus so that the door was only a stride away from a door in one of the long buildings , which Jared now opened with his free hand . He started to push her inside - - and let out a startled yelp , and Lexi was jerked backwards . She hit the ground on her left side , hard , hard enough to knock the wind out . While she fought to breathe there was a commotion overhead - scuffling - the thwacking sounds of a f istf ight , also the sound of the bus roaring and screeching away . She got her breath back finally and tried to roll onto her hands and knees , but something was wrong with her left hand . She heard herself yell . Then a woman was helping her up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Something 's wrong with my arm , " said Lexi . A few feet away , a group of people she 'd never seen before were holding onto Jared . One of them had Jared 's arm bent behind him in a way that looked to Lexi like it must hurt . Abruptly , humifiatingly , she threw up . The woman examining her arm was unperturbed . " Looks like you broke your wrist when you fell on it . Ever had a broken bone before ? " Lexi shook her head , feeling extremely strange . A moment later she was lying on the ground again . " Keep still , honey . You fainted . We need to get you to a doctor . " Somebody brought her some water . In a little bit somebody else helped her stand up again , and held her up while the woman arranged her arm in a makeshift sling . " We 'd better get you down to Moab , the medical facilities are a lot better down there . " The sling helped . " Where 's Pam ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt who had brought about her rescue . The man who had helped her stand the second time said , " Pam 's on her way to Salina . The plan was for us to meet up at Salina , and she 'd take you back up to Salt Lake . I 'm Harley Kroupa , by the way - I 'm sachem of the Moab Mission . " " The Gaian Mission ? " " That 's the one . " His grin made his mustache wiggle . Lexi managed to smile back . " Where are we ? What 's this place ? " " This is Green River , " said Harley Kroupa . " Oh . I was here one time . We went rafting . Oh , so that 's the Book Cliffs then . " She glared at Jared , wilted and sullen in the custody of the victorious Gaians , and back at Harley . " Is Pam coming to Moab too ? " " We 'll have to see . Let 's us get over there and get Jaime on the phone ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you might as well let this fellow go , " he told the man who was holding Jared in a half - nelson . " Let him get on back to Salt Lake whatever way he can . I expect he 'll be wanting to speak to the First Minister of the Church . " The Gaians all laughed , and the man holding Jared turned him loose . Jared worked his shoulders and looked down at Lexi . " Listen , I 'm sorry you got hurt , Alexis . If these goons had n't of interfered , not a thing would 've happened , you'da been fine . " " When you were holding my head down , " Lexi said , " I was n't fine . I was n't fine at all . I bet the Hefn are going to mindwipe you and I hope they do . " 6 THERE WAS NO FASTER WAY to get from Salina to Green River than the way Lexi and Jared had come , but at least the twice-weekly public bus continued on to Moab . Harley Kroupa met Pam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great to see you , " he said , shaking hands vigorously . " They pinned her wrist this morning . She 's sleeping off the sedative . She would n't settle down last night till we told her you were on your way . " He shouldered Pam 's backpack . " The Mission 's just a couple blocks along here . " They started walking , past a cluster of small gift and snack shops with CLOSED TILL SEPTEMBER 15 signs in their windows . Hot as it was in Salt Lake , here it was hotter ; dry as it was , Pam could feel the sweat pop out on her back . The wide sunwashed street was all but deserted . In the rush to leave Pam had forgotten her hat , and the ferocious light stabbed her eyes . Shading them with her hand , she asked , " How bad is the wrist ? " " Not very , just a hairline fracture . She 'll be fine , but I reckon they might have to write her out of the series for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the series any harm . Nothing 's better for telly ratings than a little notoriety . So Jaime tells me . " Harley laughed . " That Jaime is a character . " Pam smiled at him , a lean , weathered man with a drooping mustache , in jeans and boots and a ten-gallon hat . They had conferred often by phone , - this did n't feel like a first meeting . " Well now , " he said , " we 've been wantin " to get you down here for a good while . Not quite what we had in mind . You 've never been to Moab at all before , have you . " " No , " said Pam , " and I 've always wanted to , especially after I read that Edward Abbey memoir , Desert Solitaire . " Harley grinned , nodding enthusiastically . " I 'd love to see Delicate Arch , the bus went right past the entrance to the park , but I do n't suppose there 'll be time for that on this trip . " Harley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and squinted at the scenery . " Reckon not , but I hope you 'll make it down again soon , now that you 've had a glimpse of the country hereabouts . " " I hope so too , " Pam said , meaning it . " So the rescue went off without a hitch , apart from Lexi 's wrist ? " Harley ducked his head and looked sober . " We all feel mighty bad about that , Pam . I keep going over and over it , wondering if there was n't some way we could have grabbed him without her gettin " knocked down . " " Well , " said Pam - speaking in her role as Gaian Child Welfare Oversight Officer , as well as her other role as Bureau Emissary to the Church of Ephrem the Prophet - " I wo n't deny it would have been better to pull it off without anybody getting hurt , and especially without the hurt person being Lexi . Besides the effect on her , it gives the Church a stick to beat us with . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt you did the best you could in the circumstances , and neither will Humphrey , I 'm sure . So , apart from the wrist , things went smoothly ? " Harley looked relieved . " Slick as a zipper - see , Green River 's a pretty dead town most of the year . The town center 's basically moved down around the newer motels , there 's several of " em down there on the Green , right where they launch the rafts , right across from the river museum . Plus the bus stop , the bank , the farmer 's market , and so forth . . . but the train station 's in the old downtown . Well , and the Ephremite church , that 's the only church in town of course . Well this time of year there 's nobody around as a rule if it 's not Sunday , but if somebody happens to see a group of people gettin " off the train it looks suspicious . So we 're keepin " our heads down and checkin " up and down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Main . Well , so , we 're checkin " out the ones like Jaime described and talking about what to do , and while we 're doin " that we see this bus pull in at the old Book Cliff Lodge - that one 's got two parallel rows of rooms , two buildings you know , one directly behind the other , and of course that means there 's space between " em to park a bus out of sight of the street . " Pam , who had been nodding encouragement throughout Harley 's narrative , thought : That 's it . That 's what I missed . " So soon as they drive behind the streetside building , all eight of us just hightail it across the street , and the minute they get off we jump the guy that 's holding Lexi . " He shook his head ruefully . " And down he goes , and down she goes too . " " You could n't have known she 'd be on the bus , " Pam said reasonably . " Actually , I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - or taking the bus out again , for that matter , once they 'd made it here without getting caught . " Harley shot her a surprised look ; but they had arrived . " Well , here we are , this is the Mission . " Harley held a door open and Pam stepped ahead of him into the dim relief of a swamp cooler 's breeze . Two women stood up from desks as they entered . " Pam Pruitt , this is Mercedes Landrum , my assistant - my gal Jaime , so to speak . She was in the very first class of missionaries to be recruited in Utah . " He waited for them to shake hands . " And this young lady is Sophie Rodriguez , she 's a volunteer at the mission , she was along on the raid . She 's the one who took care of Lexi . " Sophie shook hands with Pam too . " I 've had some medical training so I volunteered . They were mighty glad they let me come ! " " It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sophie did the X-rays herself . " " We all feel bad about it though . We know the Church will make hay out of it . " Again Pam went through her **26;3606;TOOLONG routine : Yes , it 's a pity , - no , nobody blames you ; do n't worry , we 'll deal with it . " I 'd like to see her as soon as possible . Right away , if the doctors do n't object . " " I can take you to the clinic now , " Harley offered . " You can leave your stuff in the guest room and freshen up if you like , and you can use Mercedes 's bike . The clinic 's about a mile from here , you passed it on the bus coming in . Several of our guys are standing guard . They wanted to do something to make up for letting her get hurt . " Pam nodded ; it was a good idea . Her eyes had adjusted to the low light in the room , and she saw now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primitive , very striking , rather disturbing in fact . The figures had the massive stillness of Easter Island heads . " Would this be the local rock art ? " " Some of it , and fairly local , " said Harley . " These come from the Great Gallery in Horseshoe Canyon . They 're thousands of years old . Mercedes is a pictograph expert , among her other virtues , - she put these posters up . " " It 's awesome art , " Mercedes said . " We 're not the first ones by a long shot to have lived into this land . The people who made these paintings were proto-Gaians for sure . " More posters plastered the clinic walls , some of rock art in different styles , some of stunningly gorgeous scenery from inside the National Parks . All the rock seemed to be dark red , or red and white , or red-gold and glowing in hard sunlight . The painted figures were dark red . Pam noticed a big picture of Delicate Arch in winter , red rock against white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge said she should be waking up any time now , and it was perfectly okay for Pam to wait in the room . " I 'd like to be alone with her when she wakes up , " Pam told Harley . " Thanks for the escort . " " Sure thing , " said Harley . " See you back at the Mission for dinner , then ? " " I 'll let you know . Probably . " She turned to enter Lexi 's room . " Oh , and by the way , " he added , " you were saying about how we could n't have known Lexi would be on that bus ? I did n't get a chance to explain - they were only just pulling in from Salina when we got there . We only beat them to Green River by a couple of minutes . " Pam turned back . " I thought they got there the night before , the night of the day they kidnapped her . " He shook his head . " Nope , not till yesterday afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be there already too , but they were only just hittin " town , and if you think about it , they really could n't have gotten there very much faster . If they holed up somewhere close to Salt Lake to make that viddy , and then had to wait for a train , get a car put on , locate a bus to charter from Salina - you just got off one so you know yourself how long it takes an electric bus to get up and down those mountain roads , they only average about twenty-five or thirty . And there 's not that many trains that come this far south either nowadays . We can check the schedule , but I 'm pretty sure they got there about as fast as humanly possible . " He was obviously correct . " Of course you 're right . I must 've put in an extra day somehow . " " Not much wonder , with everything that 's been going on . See you later , then . Hope the little girl 's doin " okay . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which were made up flat . Pam went in quietly and shut the door behind her . Lexi lay in the bed closest to the door . Its head had been elevated , and Lexi 's long blond hair lay loosely mussed over the pillow . Her left arm was swathed in a white sling with an ice pack tucked inside it , and there was an IV line taped to the back of her right hand . The line led from a beeping bottle of fluid hooked to a pole . Lexi looked little and pale in all that whiteness . The sight of her struck a blow to Pam 's solar plexus that felt physical . Carefully she drew up a chair and sat in it . She watched the child 's sleeping profile while trying to grapple with the implications of what Harley had just said : that if Lexi had arrived in Green River at the same time the posse did - then the lucid dream had showed Pam , not where Lexi was , but where she was going to be some eight hours afterwards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and slid her hand , very carefully , beneath Lexi 's left hand where it was sticking out of the cast . She closed her fingers lightly around it and sat back . Considered from the perspective of an ordinary person , remote viewing combined with precognition might seem not much more remarkable than setting time transceiver coordinates mentally while in a selfinduced state of trance . But several dozen Bureau of Temporal Physics Apprentices from successive classes had been operating transceivers that way since they were children . For those with native talent , it was a teachable and learnable skill . Pam did n't understand how her mind interlaced with the transceiver field , any more than she understood how her computer did what it did . But both were familiar , part of her frame of reference . Whatever had happened in the dream was neither . State your request ; be instantly swept up and carried like a cork on a mighty swell of energy . No devices , no crystal balls or mirrors , yarrow stalks or Ouija boards , nothing like that . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream . She conjured up the moment of descent toward the long , low , double building where Lexi stood holding up her hand - this hand , the broken one - and shivered . Had Lexi known where they were taking her , had Pam read her mind somehow ? Some kind of psychic thing ? Psychics who could do remote viewing sometimes helped with police work . Even that , wild though it seemed , would have been easier for Pam to accept than that she had somehow seen into the future . Though if Time were truly One , as the Hefn were always insisting , did n't it follow that the future is just as " there " as the past and just as available to be looked at , if you knew how to look ? Pam was seized by a craving for information . Studies had been done on precognition , she 'd seen them referred to , somewhere , sometime . But having been involved so intensely for so long with the past , Pam 's imagination had never before been quickened by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gaians were fighting to head off . Then the hand lying weightless in hers moved , and Lexi stirred , gasped a little , opened her eyes and saw Pam . As her lids fluttered shut again , she smiled and murmured , " I knew you 'd come . " " She 's fine physically , " Pam told Harley Kroupa on the nurse 's phone , " but she 's pretty upset about everything that 's happened to her . She does n't want me to leave , so I guess I 'll stay here with her tonight , and then we 'll start back in the morning on the early bus . " Harley barely heard her out . " Understood . Listen , Jaime called ; I was just about to call you . He wants you to get back to him asap . " Harley paused dramatically . " The Hefn Humphrey is on his way to Moab ! He wants you to wait for him . He came to Salt Lake - well , maybe I should let Jaime tell you himself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Did Jaime say why ? " " No , just that he seemed really determined about it . He 'll be here - well - any time now I guess , he 's taking a helicopter from Salt Lake . Will he come to the Mission , do you think ? " Harley 's droopy face was flushed and transformed with excitement ; the Gaian rank-and-file almost never got to see the founder of their movement in the flesh . " He 'll probably land in the middle of Main Street and wait for the Mission to come to him , " Pam said drily . " Oh God . Okay , I 'll call my office . When he shows up , please tell him I have to stay here with Lexi , but that he 's very welcome to join us . And maybe you could send us in some dinner ? I 'm sorry , there seems to be a lot going on at once . " " Sure , we 'll rustle you up some dinner , I 'll bring it over myself , bring your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything in particular ? " " Cobbler , " Pam said . " Blackberry cobbler . I do n't expect you can produce one of those just like that . Lexi and I are n't finicky , but we 're both pretty hungry . " " I 'll see what I can do . " He rang off , and Pam put through the call to Jaime , who flashed onto the screen with both eyebrows raised . " I take it all back , boss , " he said . " You 're a magician and I 'll never second-guess you again . " " Good God , do n't say that ! I 'll have to fire you and find somebody else to keep me in line ! " He grinned . " So , Harley says she 'll be okay ? " " Completely okay medically , it 's just a hairline fracture , but she 's got some PTSD . Anxious , does n't want me out of her sight , refuses to see her mother - RoLayne and Ed Carstairs and the Canon of Lexi 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief you on the details , but anyhow something 's got to be decided about custody right away , she ca n't go home . What 's all this about Humphrey , though ? " " He turned up here around one-thirty . He 'd flown in from Santa Barbara and did n't bother to call first . I did n't say anything about your dream , I just explained the situation - said you 'd probably bring Lexi back up here tomorrow , and did he want to make himself at home at your place till then , and he said , honest to God , he said ? will not wait at Pam Pruitt 's house if Pam Pruitt is in Moab . I will go to directly to Moab . I will not pass Go . I will not collect two hundred dollars . " Where did Humphrey learn to play Monopoly ? " " Oh , we used to play board games a lot at the BTP . He loved all those corny old ones like Monopoly and Clue . " " After that I heard a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I assumed it was him , coming straight there . " " It was , " said Pam , " I hear the chopper now . Did he say what was so urgent it could n't wait ? " " Nope . Maybe he 's always wanted to see Delicate Arch . " Pam groaned . " Okay , let 's focus on the custody question . Lexi 's got aunts and uncles in Salt Lake and Ogden , but they 're all Ephremites and she does n't want anything to do with Ephremites right now . She has n't come right out and said so , but I know what she really wants is to stay with me . And that 's fine , for a while , but if she 's going to keep acting in A Thousand Miles when she 's better , she 's going to need two things : a different responsible adult on location , and a full-time non-Ephremite bodyguard . Can you get rolling on all that ? " Jaime 's mouth twisted sideways . " Hmm . Custody and bodyguard I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What about her dad , could he take over for RoLayne ? " Pam realized she knew nothing whatever about Lexi 's father , not even his first name . " It 's a thought , but I 'd better ask Lexi how she likes that idea . He 's her dad , but he 's an Ephremite too ; Ed Carstairs is his stepfather . Hold off on that one , I guess . Have you called Marcee ? " " Yesterday afternoon , soon 's I knew something to tell her . The writers are already beavering away on a script about Kate 's broken arm . Bit ghoulish , do n't you think ? " Pam grinned . " I guess that 's show biz . See you tomorrow then . " She cut the connection , apologized to the nurse , whose name tag read MRS JACKSON , for keeping the phone tied up so long , and went back into Lexi 's room . The patient was sitting up in bed ; she 'd taken her arm out of the sling and was examining her cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " and guess what else is on the way ? Humphrey ! Did you hear the helicopter ? " Lexi nodded , beginning to smile . " Was that him ? Cool ! Why is he here though ? " " Jaime was n't sure . Maybe he 'll tell us himself . How do you feel ? Want to get dressed before he gets here ? " " Cani ? " " I do n't see why not , if we can get the nurse to take your IV out . " Mrs. Jackson called the doctor , then came in and disconnected Lexi from her drip . The bandage she plastered over the insertion point had yellow ducklings on it , and Lexi slid her eyes sideways at Pam , saying more plainly than words , What does she think I am , a baby2 Pam grinned behind the nurse 's departing back . " Where 's your stuff ? " She did n't know , but Pam opened the locker door and there were Lexi 's jeans and T-shirt on hooks , and her socks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt too but I guess it 's still on that bus . " " Hmm . " Pam took the T-shirt down and considered it . " Let 's see if this 'll go on over your cast . Did I ever tell you I broke my arm when I was about your age ? I remember what a hassle it was , trying to get stuff on over my head by myself . " " How 'd you break yours ? " " Falling out of a tree . " She sat down on the bed and untied Lexi 's hospital gown . The shirt went over the cast without difficulty , then over the other arm and head . Lexi tugged her hair free and pulled on her own jeans one-handedly , sitting on a chair to do it , but Pam had to button the waistband . Lexi did the socks and shoes herself and Pam tied the laces . " Teamwork is the answer . You 'll get better at doing things for yourself , though . Since you 're right-handed it 's good it was your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown envelope tucked under her arm , knocked and came in as Pam was brushing the tangles out of Lexi 's hair . When Lexi introduced her to Pam she added proudly , " Dr. Boniface is a Galani " " I am indeed , and it 's a great pleasure to meet you , Ms. Pruitt . " " It 's a great pleasure for me , " said Pam , " to meet the person who fixed up my girl here . " She shook the doctor 's hand . " Would you care to stick around and meet the Hefn Humphrey ? He 's rumored to be headed this way . " " It 's more than a rumor . Harley called me a couple of minutes ago . They were leaving as soon as Sophie 'd finished hitching up the team . Sounds like they 're bringing enough food to feed a regiment . " " Dollars to doughnuts Humphrey will be driving by the time they get here , " said Pam . " Anything I should know about Lexi 's wrist ? We 're leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bed . " These are her X-rays . The Salt Lake orthopedist will want to see them . Lexi , your cast comes off in five or six weeks , then they 'll give you a splint , that 'll make things easier . Keep the sling on till then , okay ? " Lexi nodded . A small commotion outside had been growing louder as the doctor spoke . " Here comes dinner , " Pam said . Dr. Boniface peered out the window . " And every Gaian in Moab . " The door of the clinic burst open . Lexi bounced on her bed with excitement , then bounced out of it as Pam hurried into the reception area . One of the truly endearing things about Humphrey was the way he gave himself up completely to simple pleasures . " Hello , my dear ! Look , I am a driver of horses ! Harley Kroupa gave me a lesson and put the reins into my hands ! We tzottedl It is very , very - it is very - delightful - to drive a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delight . " And hello to you also , dear little Lexi ! Like you , I am now a driver of horses ! Do you also find it very wonderful ? " Lexi , who 'd been hovering in the doorway of her room , now came out and leaned against Pam . " Hi , Humphrey . I do find it lots of fun , I wish I got to do it more . " " On A Thousand Miles , " Humphrey explained to the gathered Gaians , who doubtless already knew this as well as he did , " Kate McPherson had once to drive horses and a supply wagon through the North Platte River . I had no idea how delightful this could be . " He made a visible effort to calm himself down . " How are you feeling this evening , little dear ? I am very sorry about your broken bone . " " It 's only a hairline fracture , " Lexi told him , - she 'd been hearing people say that since yesterday . " It kind of hurts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sling out of the way . " It 's swollen . Better get that ice pack back on it . Can she have something for pain ? " she asked Mrs. Jackson , who was standing at her station taking in the show . Susan Boniface , who had come out to see it as well , said , " I 'll take care of it . Come along , Lexi , " and they ducked back into the room . Harley and the other Gaians had by now crowded into the reception behind Humphrey , carrying covered dishes , picnic baskets , and coolers . The space filled up with good smells . " Here 's what we 'll do , " said Pam . " Lexi and I will entertain Humphrey in Lexi 's room , but there 's enough food here for an Irish wake . Why do n't you folks put those dishes on the nurse 's station and have a potluck out here - if that 's okay with you ? " she asked the nurse , who nodded happily , - things were obviously not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanks . We 'll all help clean up . " " Here 's Humphrey 's cobbler , " said Mercedes , the " gal Jaime " from the Mission . " You can just take that in with you . He had the most wonderful time driving over here . " It really was a blackberry cobbler , still warm . Pam looked up from its purple surface with amazed gratitude . " How - " " I had one left in the freezer , from last summer . Humphrey is more than welcome to it . They 're almost ripe again anyway . " " THE GREAT THING aboutsomany Utah Gaians being ex-Ephremites , " Pam told him later , after everyone had gone home and Lexi had dropped off to sleep , " is that they can put on a first-rate potluck at the drop of a hat . Having to eat hunkered on the floor , out of sick-up basins with tongue depressors , just made it that much more of an adventure for them . The morale of the Moab Mission will probably never be higher than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bedside straight chair , Humphrey folded up on the bed next to Lexi 's - straight chairs were just about impossible for him - clutching the round glass cobbler dish to his rough , hairy torso and a serving spoon in one of his forked hands . He had shared this treat with Lexi and Pam , but had eaten two-thirds of it himself , and now from time to time he scraped the spoon around the sides and scooped off the scrapings with his lower lip . " The Gaians of Moab have cause to celebrate without ceasing , " he said mildly . " This land they have lived into , this is a place where Gaia shows herself without equivocation . This is the true Jerusalem and well they know it . " Humphrey gave the bowl a final scrape-scoop and set it on the bed beside him . " How were you able to find Lexi Allred ? " Pam took her time describing the lucid dream . " Lexi did n't know where they were taking her , " she finished . " She asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very question but he would n't say . He knew , the Canon knew , RoLayne thought she knew . Lexi did n't know . So either I read one of their minds in my sleep , or I somehow saw a little way into the future , or - what ? " She 'd been watching Lexi snooze while telling the story of the rescue , but now at a sudden movement she glanced up . Humphrey was standing on the bed . All his body hair bristled straight out . His large flat eyes were trained on Pam . " What is it ? " she said again , and stood herself . Humphrey made a noise she had never heard any Hefn make in all her years among them , a high gargling sound , shockingly alien . His arms whirled in circles . In her own bed Lexi started awake . " What 's the matter ? What happened ? " she asked in a frightened voice . Pam shot Humphrey a warning look . " Nothing 's the matter , honey . Humphrey just got carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fine , go back to sleep . " " Nothing is wrong , little Lexi , " Humphrey said in a high , strangled voice . " Everything is right . Everything is wonderful ! " As an afterthought he sat down . Of course Lexi did n't go back to sleep . Her arm hurt , she needed more ice , she needed more pills and a drink ; what she needed more than anything was for Pam to pull her sheets straight , tuck her in , and generally reassure her . When her eyelids finally fluttered shut and her breathing was even , Pam turned back to Humphrey , ready to remind him to keep his voice down ; but the Hefn had become calm . His hair was flatter , and he held both hands up in front of him , a gesture of placation . He spoke in a rusty whisper . " I will be quiet , my dear , I will not forget again . Yet what you tell me fills me with joy . For out of crisis has come this transformation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her across sleeping Lexi . The extremeness of his behavior made Pam uneasy . " Are n't you overreacting ? I would n't call one precognitive dream a transformation . " Though come to that , the certainty back in Santa Barbara about who Lexi 's kidnappers were , the way her consciousness had expanded , become a lens of power - if that and the dream were linked somehow - " You would not call it one , because you do not know . " Humphrey 's pelt had begun to erect again . " Behold , I show you a mystery ! That is from First Corinthians . Come . " Spinning round , he walked briskly through the doorway and directly up to one of the posters on the wall . Pam followed and stood beside him . The poster displayed two long , static red figures , different from , but also similar to , those she had seen in the Moab Mission . The figure on the left had a flattened head with huge goggle eyes and skinny arms held akimbo , - it looked much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Humphrey did . The one on the right also had skinny arms , but its head was small and surmounted with what appeared to be a pair of rabbit ears or two upright , feathery antennae ; and around these structures a group of insects or tiny birds formed a kind of vertical halo . " Look , my dear . Do you see the little birds ? This is a shaman figure . Do you know what a shaman is ? " " Um - a kind of sorcerer , a medicine man ? " " In traditional human cultures , a shaman is a person who travels on behalf of his people into the spirit world . He enters the spirit world in a variety of ways . Some of the ways , such as fasting , purging , going without sleep , and eating vile- tasting substances , are quite disagreeable , but many shamans have no other means of getting out of their physical bodies . They must do this if they are to seek a cure for an illness or an advantage in warfare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Pam looked at Humphrey in amazement . " How the dickens do you come to know all that ? I would n't have thought it was in your line , so to speak . " " A very common reason for entering the spirit world is to find what has been lost . Valuable objects . Missing persons ! Shamans also achieve entry in ways that are less unpleasant than purging or ingesting peyote buttons . Drumming , for instance , can effect the separation . Also , some of the most powerful shamans are known to be strong dreamers . " Pam stared at him , then back at the poster . Her heart began to thump in her chest . " These pictures are thousands of years old , " she protested . " This painted shaman does not portray your experience specifically , my dear . " He trotted to the nurse 's station and did some things to the computer , while Pam continued to stare at the unnerving rabbit-eared figure with its bird halo . " But these shamans of a different ancient culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He turned the screen so Pam could see . It was another pictograph , done in a different style . Against a whitish , uneven surface Pam made out a pair of shapes like identical red sausages , each with four stick limbs , placed horizontally at the center of the screen . Each arm and leg terminated in a three-toed bird 's foot . Sausages or not , stick limbs or not , there was nothing Easter Islandlike about these figures . That they were in flight was unmistakable , partly owing to the fact that above and below them , and oriented in the same direction , a flock of birds was flying . These were no tiny creatures swarming like gnats around an immobile spaceman 's antennae . Relative to the sausage figures these birds were large , and there were a lot of them - ten - and though they had been painted crudely , the arrangement was extremely dynamic . The shamans flew across the rock wall and the birds flew with them , supporting them , guiding them - Pam stepped to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ring . There was writing on the screen , a caption : " Escort Birds of Fate Bell . " Below the label Pam read : " In this rare scene from Fate Bell Shelter , ten birds flank two flying shaman figures , illustrating their role as psychopomps or guardian spirits during the shamanic voyage of the soul . " What the Sam Hill was a psychopomp ? Wordlessly she looked at Humphrey , who said , " The people who made these pictures , called the Pecos River culture , lived in western Texas perhaps three thousand years ago , at approximately the same time the people in these reproductions on the walls were living here in Utah . " Despite the distances involved , the rock paintings of the two cultures are amazingly alike in many respects . Not in how they are painted , but in what they depict . No one is able to explain this likeness satisfactorily , or explain why it should be shared by one other culture in Baja California , and by no others in between or elsewhere . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pecos River people were unique . " He punched some keys , and a different picture flashed on the screen : a weathered oval figure outlined in red . The interior of its torso had been painted black , with red and yellow markings . Strikingly , the torso and outspread limbs were heavily fringed in red , giving it somewhat the aspect of a Paramecium with arms . Even more strikingly , the figure was headless . Two straight red lines jutted up from the neck region and two other lines crossed them at the tips ; to Pam it looked rather like a child 's drawing of a trolley car . The caption said : " FANTASTIC CREATURES , THE DART-HEADED FIGURES . Invariably , these creatures can be identified by the parallel lines crossed by one or two bars that substitute for its head . The cross bars often bear an oval motif that designates them as a sign for dart or lance . Some part of the body is hairy , whether just the appendages or the entire torso . . . this mythical creature is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Pecos River cosmological cast whose role in some way informed the audience , but the intent of this morality play is no longer evident . " Now Humphrey was making different versions of the monstrous creature flick on the computer screen . There seemed to be quite a few of them . " Dart-headed figure , Devils River . " " Dart-headed figure , Pecos River . " " Dart-headed figures , Panther Cave . " The figures had plainly been rendered by many different hands , but virtually all were fringed in dark red , as if tricked out in Daniel Boone buckskins . Pam wanted to get back to the escort birds , but Humphrey kept methodically displaying pictographs of the hairy headless beings . Quelling her impatience , she said , " These look powerful , but creepy . What 's the fringe , is it static electricity ? " " No , " said Humphrey , and waited . After a bit Pam looked up from the screen . All his body hair was erected . As she stared , he raised his stumpy arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to say . He said it . " They dreamed us . " " They- " " Dreamed us . Three thousand years ago , the Pecos River people dreamed the Hefn . " Pam stared at him , then at the screen . " The heads - the heads are weapons . Thought control - hypnotic suggestion . Memory excision ? " " Yes . " " That 's - no , wait , wait a minute . " She backed off , waving her arms as if to drive the thought away . " How can you know that ? These could be anything , you ca n't be sure they 're Hefn ! Unless there was a contact you never happened to mention , three thousand years ago ! " Humphrey bent his body and perched on the nurse 's desk chair . " I came across the pictures by sheerest chance , in California , in a book . When I saw them , I knew . No : when I saw them in the book , I believed . Then I saw these ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then I did know . As you knew the Ephremites had stolen Lexi , I knew this . " " That they dreamed the Hefn . Three thousand years ago . " Pam reached for a chair and sat in it . " Last February , when I was coming to see you in Salt Lake , " he said , " I made a detour . I went to Texas . Del Rio , Texas . There is no airfield . I was driven to Del Rio from Austin , Texas , in an ambulance , by a rock art expert who does not remember what he did that day . " As always , Pam winced at this allusion to casual mindwipe - of Humphrey erasing a day out of somebody 's life to satisfy his curiosity . She pushed the reaction away . " Did you take a transceiver ? " He twisted , a Hefn shrug . " What would be the point ? We open a window , we observe a shaman painting a " dart-headed figure " on a cave wall . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about these figures , we would not understand what he was saying . As you observe , the figures could be anything . But they are not , " said Humphrey fiercely , " ' anything ' ! " " Before I say one more word , " Pam said , " I want to know if I 'm going to remember this conversation . " The Hefn conveyed shock . " How can you ask me this ? " Pam thought of the hapless rock-art expert from Austin . " How can I not ? Look what you 're showing me ! " Humphrey 's flat eyes turned on Pam . " Have you understood nothing then , my dear ? That everything is different now ? " Pam stared back . " Why is everything different ? " " Because , " said Humphrey , " the Hefn do not dream the future . The Hefn do not dream at all ! Using a piece of finely calibrated equipment , and our mental abilities , we look into the past . But you , Pam Pruitt , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort , have dreamed an event before it occurred . Like the shamans of old , you have looked into the future . " " Not very far into the future , " Pam protested lamely . " A few hours , maybe half a day . " Humphrey hit another key and the image of a dart-headed figure flipped back onscreen . " These humans saw three millennia into the future . You are a Temporal Physics Apprentice , a mathematician , you understand the behavior of irrational numbers and nonlinear equations . You understand how chaos overwhelms every attempt to predict the future mathematically . But Time is One ! Like the shamans of old , you have overleapt the predictive models , you have seen what will be ! " As he spoke Humphrey had been tapping more keys ; and now four figures shaped like bullets with arms and legs soared up the face of a cliff , trailed by a horizontal line of five large ducklike birds with outspread wings . The caption read , " Birds and anthropomorphic figures rising from a sawtooth horizon at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the construction of Armistad Reservoir . " More escort birds , drowned ones . Pam shivered ; way beyond freaky though it was , she was frankly mesmerized . Another tap , and still another image : " Rotund shaman rising in a cloud of birds . Halo Shelter on Devils River . " Tingling excitement surged through Pam , a thrill of focussed energy , - she was frankly dying to know more . " These are all in Texas ? " " Yes . But many , many rock paintings and petroglyphs from many , many ancient cultures depict birds and shamans , " Humphrey informed her . " Everywhere , birds are seen as symbolic of the flight of the human soul from the body , into the spirit world . I have delved deep into the subject of shamanism since my visit to Texas . " " Whoa , " said Pam . " We 're getting pretty far into a belief system I have n't got anymore , when we start talking about the human soul and the spirit world . " Humphrey twinkled for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cobbler . " It would appear to be unnecessary for the individual to embrace the belief system , if the belief system has decided to embrace the individual . " But then he spoke in dead earnest . " You also , Pam Pruitt , must now delve deep into the subject of shamanism . Also into the subject of precognitive dreaming , which is the same subject au fond . At bottom . These matters were studied intensively by anthropologists and neurologists , before the coming of the Hefn . There is a very great deal for you to learn , whole libraries of information ! " " Look , " said Pam , " I 'll do it , I guess I want to anyway , but I would n't get my hopes up , I mean I would n't count on this being any help with the Homestead problem . It might be just something personal to me . " " Nevertheless I shall hope , " he said fervently . " It may be our best hope . It may be all the hope we have ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I just " - she realized as she said it how good this sounded - " drop out for a while ? Just go away and start learning ? Jaime can take over in Salt Lake , he 's ready for that . " Humphrey never skipped a beat . " Will you go to Kentucky ? " " Texas first . Then Kentucky . " Her personal Ground : perfect . " I 'd rather nobody knew for now . We can say I 'm making a retreat , brainstorming about Homeland . Not that far from the truth . " He " nodded . " " A good provisional plan . I think you are right to tell no one . Telling could dilute the force at work in you . " Pam nodded with him . The mystery of what her mind was developing into now begged to be solved ; solve that , and the answer might bear upon the conundrum of what lay in the future for humanity and their alien overseers . That was what Humphrey obviously believed , and really he had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolved the conflict , if it were possible , why not seek a solution in the future , where ancient Pecos River shamans had encountered the Hefn three thousand years ago ? Then with a jolt she remembered . " Uh-oh - what about Lexi ? I told Jaime to get custody papers ready for me to sign as soon as I got back to Salt Lake ! Damn ! It could take a while to find her another situation , if we even can . " The need to rescue Lexi , to get information about her not available by ordinary means , had evidently rammed the " transformation " through ; but Lexi was safe now . Pam paced the reception , passing back and forth beneath monumental or attenuated red anthropomorphe sublimely indifferent to her dilemma . " It wo n't be easy , she needs a lot of sensitive support . I hate to put anything extra on Jaime and Claudia right now . Maybe ode of the other Gaians , or like a younger couple - " " Could n't I just come with you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , was Lexi standing in the doorway , barefoot in underpants and T-shirt and her white sling . " They can kill me off . Or maybe leave me with the Pawnees till my arm gets better . I would n't be any trouble , honest , " she pleaded , " I could help out ! " Shit ! Before Pam could stop herself she had blurted sharply , " How long have you been standing there eavesdropping ? " " I did n't mean to eavesdrop ! I just woke up and heard you talking , and my arm was hurting , and then you said , " her voice squeaked up , she was trying not to cry , " that it was a picture of the Hefn , so I got up , I was going to come out , but then I was n't sure if I should , and then you said - " Two tears spilled down her face . Stricken , Pam rushed to put her arms around Lexi , taking care not to bump the wrist . " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all , I should n't have used that word , it 's our fault for talking where you might wake up and hear us . " The girl sagged against her , crying openly now , not trying to hold it in . Inwardly Pam sagged too . Her bubble of excitement had been popped , but that was n't the worst . Given a good enough reason , she had proved as ready to betray Lexi as any of them . " Little Lexi , do not cry , " Humphrey said , and quietly to Pam , " Shall I take this memory away ? " Pam shook her head ; but Lexi , her face muffled in Pam 's teal-green uniform shirt , said , " Could I come to Texas if I did ? " " You can come anyway , " Pam said .
