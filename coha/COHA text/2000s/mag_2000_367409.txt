I called my parents recently to say I was thinking about putting them in a nursing home . " But I 'm only 58 , " my mother said . " We 're healthy . " Not to be critical , but my parents are the sort of optimists who bought a retirement home with a second floor . And a spiral staircase . And low-wattage lighting on the landing . " It 's a death trap , " I said . " We like our house , " my mother said . That 's just like them . And , it turns out , just like the rest of America . <P> An AARP survey released this month found that most people ages 45 and older want to stay in their homes as long as possible . This wish belies the fact that nearly 1 in 4 of the 2,000 surveyed predicted that within five years , someone in their household would have trouble getting around . <P> With the number of elderly Americans expected to double by 2030 , when 70 million people will be 65 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the reality of the most ubiquitous aging issues : housing , health care and finances . But according to AARP researcher Linda Barrett , most parents and their adult children still avoid the topics . <P> Not me . I called Dr. Donna Benton , a gerontologist at the University of Southern California ( no , Mom , I did not say anything about your slippery new bathroom tile , which , if it did come up , was mentioned only in the context of nonskid tub strips ) , and described how I had broached the subject . <P> Dr. Benton laughed . " That was not a good way , " she said in a tone that indicated I might benefit from a class she teaches to interested adults at U.S.C. called " Your Aging Parents . " For one thing , " nursing home " is an antiquated term ; her students learn that options range from long-term assisted-living facilities to short-term rehab to building a wheelchair ramp from driveway to door . <P> It turned out that I was in denial . And I was typical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our parents as being the strong role models , " she said . As she spoke , a big heavy wad of something started to fill the part of my chest I prefer to reserve for breathing . I described this sensation to Dr. Benton in clinical terms : " You 're making me feel creepy . " <P> Luckily , not all adult children need a direct approach . Parents send signals . " If your parent talks about a friend who went to the hospital , and nobody knew what their feeling about life support was , you can say , ' So , Mom , have you guys already put all that stuff together ? ' " Dr. Benton said . <P> Start now . When it comes to a living will or who should have power of attorney , " You are not going to sit down and get it done in two hours , " Dr. Benton said . " Give yourself time . " ( If someone already needs help , call your local , federally mandated area Agency on Aging ; a list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
