The big cat 's eyes narrowed to slits , its tail snapping back and forth like a banner mounted upon a windy parapet . It bared its teeth , almost certainly hissing at me , only to have the sound swept away by the storm . I stood and yelledall that was normally needed to frighten away one of these lethal , if cowardly animals . This cat did n't back off , however . The cougar was gaunt , plainly starving , so much so that its ribs were outlined beneath its skin . No wonder it had attacked the girl and now refused to give ground , even in this howling storm . I needed my musket . I was a fine shot ; all I required was one opportunity . But the animal hurled itself at me afore I could act . I barely had time to fling up my arm to block its charge afore we tumbled backward . I slammed onto my back , skidding over crumbling rock . The panther landed on my chest , its breath rank as it snarled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underbelly , but not afore it savaged my thigh . We separated for a moment , but the enraged animal charged again . I scrabbled backward as we fought . There was no time to think as I fended off the cat 's huge , powerful paws , blow after blow . At last its claws caught me across the face and my skin sang with pain . Furious , I struck out blindingly with my fist , felt the satisfying " crunch " of a solid blow landing on the animal 's sensitive snout . The cat yowled as it slunk back but did n't leave . Injured , I sank to one knee , the wind continuing to howl all the while . Grit continuously scored my face and my watering eyes burned even more fiercely . The ground shuddered as a nearby tree crashed to the earth . A second followed moments later , and I glanced over as it bounced offthe ground . Hot blood ran into my eyes whence the cougar had clawed me . Instinct warned me to glance up in time to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I threw myself to the ground , and the beast passed inches above me . I scrambled upright , mopping blood and sweat from my eyes . The air was a whirlwind of dust and dirt as I searched desperately for wherever the cat had landed . That was when I saw it . Not the cat . The cat was gone . Where it should have landed was a thing a monster , a devil out of the bowels of hell . Or at least that was what I thought I saw . My eyes were so blurry that it was hard be certain exactly what it I beheld . I had a vague impression of something huge . Seven , eight , maybe nine feet tall it stood . It was two-legged , but had an enormous head that was a ghastly shade of black . Its mouth lacked lips and was filled with terrible , jagged teeth . Even from where I stood it reeked , as if left dead for days beneath a blazing sun . I briefly wondered what had become of the cat ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then I had another , more unsettling thought . What if cat and monster were one and the same ? Perhaps I had come face-to-face with a shape-shifter . I had heard talk of such creatures , but had ascribed the stories to timid minds fearful of the night . Perhaps I had been wrong to be so dismissive . Then , as if things were n't bizarre enough already , I thought I heard a voice rise above the wind . " Cole , " the voice called . " Cole Seavey.
