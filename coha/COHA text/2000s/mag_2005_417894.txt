The future will see not just more mouths to feed , but a growing demand for higher-quality , more resource-intensive food . The world 's farmers may not be up to the many challenges of meeting those demands . // During the last half of the twentieth century , the world economy expanded sevenfold . In 2000 alone , its growth exceeded that of the entire nineteenth century . Economic growth , now the goal of governments everywhere , has become the status quo . Stability is considered a departure from the norm . As the economy grows , its demands are outgrowing the earth , exceeding many of the planet 's natural capacities . While the world economy multiplied sevenfold in just 50 years , the earth 's natural life-support systems remained essentially the same . Water use tripled , but the capacity of the hydrological system to produce fresh water through evaporation changed little . The demand for seafood increased fivefold , but the sustainable yield of oceanic fisheries was unchanged . Fossil-fuel burning raised carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) emissions fourfold , but the capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a buildup of CO2 in the atmosphere and a rise in the earth 's temperature . As human demands surpass the earth 's natural capacities , expanding food production becomes more difficult . Losing Agricultural Momentum Environmentalists have been saying for years that , if the environmental trends of recent decades continued , the world would one day be in trouble . What was not clear was what form the trouble would take and when it would occur . Now it has become increasingly clear that tightening food supplies will be our greatest trouble and that it will emerge within the next few years . In early 2004 , China 's forays into the world market to buy 8 million tons of wheat marked what could be the beginning of the global shift from an era of grain surpluses to one of grain scarcity . World grain production is a basic indicator of dietary adequacy at the individual level and of overall food security at the global level . After nearly tripling from 1950 to 1996 , the grain harvest stayed flat for seven years in a row , through 2003 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short of consumption in each of the last four of those years . The shortfalls of nearly 100 million tons in 2002 and again in 2003 were the largest on record . Consumption exceeded production for four years , leading world grain stocks to drop to the lowest level in 30 years . The last time stocks were this low , in 1972-1974 , wheat and rice prices doubled . Importing countries competed vigorously for inadequate supplies . A politics of scarcity emerged , and some countries , such as the United States , restricted exports . In 2004 , a combination of stronger grain prices at planting time and the best weather in a decade yielded a substantially larger harvest for the first time in eight years . Yet even with a harvest that was up 124 million tons from that in 2003 , the world still consumed all the grain it produced , leaving none to rebuild stocks . If stocks can not be rebuilt in a year of exceptional weather , when can they ? Photograph // From 1950 to 1984 , world grain production expanded faster than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 250 kilograms to the historic peak of 339 kilograms-an increase of 34% . This positive development initially reflected recovery from the disruption of World War II , and then later solid technological advances . The rising tide of food production lifted all ships , largely eradicating hunger in some countries and substantially reducing it in many others . But since 1984 , growth in grain harvests has fallen behind growth in population . The amount of grain produced per person fell to 308 kilograms in 2004 . Africa is suffering the most , with a decline in grain produced per person that is unusually steep and taking a heavy human toll . Soils are depleted of nutrients , and the amount of grainland per person has been shrinking steadily due to population growth in recent decades . But in addition , Africa must now contend with the loss of adults to AIDS , which is depleting the rural workforce and undermining agriculture . In two of the last three years , grain production per person in subSaharan Africa has been below 120 kilograms-dropping to a level that leaves millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trends are contributing to the global loss of agricultural momentum . Among these are the cumulative effects of soil erosion on land productivity , the loss of cropland to desertification , and the accelerating conversion of cropland to nonfarm uses . All are taking a toll , although their relative roles vary among countries . In addition , farmers are seeing fewer new technologies to dramatically boost production . The highyielding varieties of wheat , rice , and corn that were developed a generation or so ago doubled and tripled yields , but there have not been any dramatic advances in the genetic yield potential of grains since then . Similarly , the use of fertilizer has now plateaued or even declined slightly in key food-producing countries . The rapid growth in irrig ation that characterized much of the last half century has also slowed . In leed , in some countries the irrigated area is shrinking . And now , two newer environ mental trends are slowing the grov th in world food production : falling ' vater tables and rising temperatures , The bottom line is that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ h the growing demand for grain . The rise in world grainland product vity , which averaged over 2% a year from 1950 to 1990 , fell to scarcely 1% a year in the last decade of the twentieth century . This will likely drop further in the years immediately ahead . If the rise in land productivity continues to slow and if population continues to grow by 70 million or more per year , governments may begin to define national security in terms of food shortages , rising food prices , and the emerging politics of scarcity . Food insecurity may soon eclipse terrorism as the overriding concern of national governments . Food Challenges Go from Local to Global The world economy is making excessive demands on the earth . Evidence of this can be seen in collapsing fisheries , shrinking forests , expanding deserts , rising CO2 levels , eroding soils , rising temperatures , falling water tables , melting glaciers , deteriorating grasslands , rising seas , rivers that are running dry , and disappearing species . Nearly all of these environmentally destructive trends contribute to global food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1F in temperature in mountainous regions can substantially increase rainfall and decrease snowfall . The result is more flooding during the rainy season and less snowmelt to feed rivers during the dry season , when farmers need irrigation water . Or consider the collapse of fisheries and the associated leveling off of the oceanic fish catch . During the last half century , the fivefold growth in the world fish catch that satisfied much of the growing demand for animal protein pushed oceanic fisheries to their limits and beyond . Now , in this new century , we can not expect any growth at all in the catch . The Food and Agriculture Organization warns that all future growth in animal protein supplies can only come from that produced on land , not the sea , putting even more pressure on the earth 's land and water resources . Until recently , the economic effects of environmental trends , such as overfishing , overpumping , and overplowing , were largely local . Among the many examples are the collapse of the cod fishery off Newfoundland from overfishing that cost Canada 40,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a result of aquifer depletion , and the shrinking grain harvest of Kazakhstan as wind erosion claimed half of its cropland . Now , if world food supplies tighten , we may see the first global economic effect of environmentally destructive trends . Rising food prices could be the first economic indicator to signal serious trouble in the deteriorating relationship between the global economy and the earth 's ecosystem . The short-lived 20% rise in world grain prices in early 2004 may turn out to be a warning tremor before the quake . Two New Challenges As world demand for food has tripled , so too has the use of water for irrigation . As a result , the world is incurring a vast water deficit . But the trend is largely invisible because the deficit takes the form of aquifer overpumping and falling water tables . Falling water levels are often not discovered until wells go dry . The world water deficit is a relatively recent phenomenon . Only within the last half century have powerful diesel and electrically driven pumps given us the pumping capacity to deplete aquifers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1960s and the drilling of millions of wells have in many cases pushed water withdrawal beyond the aquifers ' recharge from rainfall . As a result , water tables are now falling in countries that are home to more than half of the world 's people , including China , India , and the United States - the three largest grain producers . Photograph Farmer in China 's Henan province inspects his dried-up wheat during 2000 drought . Already experiencing declining productivity , China 's farmlands face the new challenges of global climate change . // Groundwater levels are falling throughout the northern half of China . Under the North China Plain , they are dropping 1-3 meters ( 3-10 feet ) a year . In India , they are falling in most states , including the Punjab , the country 's breadbasket . And in the United States , water levels are falling throughout the southern Great Plains and the Southwest . Overpumping creates a false sense of food security : It enables us to satisfy growing food needs today , but it almost guarantees a decline in food production tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tons of water to produce a single ton of grain , so food security is closely tied to water security . Seventy percent of world water use is for irrigation , 20% is used by industry , and 10% is for residential purposes . As urban water use rises while aquifers are being depleted , farmers are faced with a shrinking share of a shrinking water supply . Photograph Street cafe in Shanghai offers wealth of dining choices . A booming economy in China has led to demand for not only more food , but more resource-intensive foods such as burgers . // Meanwhile , temperatures are rising and concern about climate change is intensifying . Scientists have begun to focus on the precise relationship between temperature and crop yields . Crop ecologists at the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines and at the U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) have jointly concluded that each 1C rise in temperature during the growing season cuts 10% off the yields of wheat , rice , and corn . Over the last three decades , the earth 's average temperature has climbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came during the last six years . In 2002 , recordhigh temperatures and drought shrank grain harvests in both India and the United States . In 2003 , Europe bore the brunt of the intense heat . The record-breaking August heat wave claimed 35,000 lives in eight nations and withered grain harvests in virtually every country from France to Ukraine . In a business-as-usual scenario , the earth 's average temperature will rise by 1.4-5.8C ( 20 - 10F ) during this century , according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change . These projections are for the earth 's average temperature , but the rise is expected to be much greater over land than over the oceans , in the higher latitudes than in the equatorial regions , and in the interior of continents than in the coastal regions . This suggests that increases far in excess of the projected average are likely for regions such as the North American breadbasket-the region defined by the Great Plains of the United States and Canada and the U.S. corn belt . Today 's farmers face the prospect of temperatures higher than any generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studying the USDA world grain database more than a dscade ago , I noted that , if countries fire already densely populated when they begin to industrialize rapidly , three things happen in quick succession to make them heavily dependent on grain imports : Grain consumption climbs as incomes rise , grainland area shrinks , and grain prodi ction falls . The rapid industrialization that drives up demand simultaneously shrinks the cropland area . The inevitable result is that grain imports soar . Within a few decades , countries can go from being essentially selfsufficient to importing 70% or more of their grain . I call this the " apan syndrome " because I first recognized this sequence of events in Japan , a country that today imports 70% of its grain . In a fast-industrializing country , grain consumption rises rapidl/ . Initially , rising incomes permit mere direct consumption of grain , but before long the growth shifts to the greater indirect consumption of grain in the form of grain-intensive livestock products , such as pork , poultry , and eggs . Once rapid industrialization s under way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a country industrializes and modernizes , cropland gets taken over by industrial and residential dev2lopments and by roads , highways , and parking lots to accommodate more cars and drivers . When farmers are left with fragments of land that are too small to be cultivated economically , they often simply abandon their plots , seeking employment elsewhere . As rapid industrialization pulls labor out of the countryside , it often leads to less double cropping , a practice that depends on quickly ha rvesting one grain crop once it is rip ; and immediately preparing the seedbed for the next crop . With the less of workers as young people migrate to cities , the capacity to do this diminishes . As incomes rise , diets diversify , generating demand for more fruits and vegetables . This in turn eads farmers to shift land from grain to these more profitable , high-value crops . Japan was essentially self-sufficient in grain when its grain harvested area peaked in 1955 . Since then the grainland area has shrunk by more than half . The multiple-cropping index has dropped from nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one crop today . Some six years after Japan 's grain area began to shrink , the shrinkage overrode the rise in land productivity and overall production began to decline . With grain consumption climbing and production falling , grain imports soared . By 1983 , imports accounted for 70% of Japan 's grain consumption , a level they remain at today . South Korea and Taiwan are tracing Japan 's pattern . In both cases , the decline in grain area was followed roughly a decade later by a decline in production . Perhaps this should not be surprising , since the forces at work in the two countries are exactly the same as in Japan . And , like Japan , both South Korea and Taiwan now import some 70% of their total grain supply . Based on the sequence of events in these three countries that affected grain production , consumption , and imports-the Japan syndrome-it was easy to anticipate the precipitous decline in China 's grain production that began in 1998 . The obvious question now is which other countries will enter a period of declining grain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those that come to mind are India , Indonesia , Bangladesh , Pakistan , Egypt , and Mexico . Of particular concern is India , with a population of nearly 1.1 billion now and growing by 18 million a year . In recent years , India 's economic growth has accelerated , averaging 6%-7% a year . This growth , only slightly slower than that of China , is also beginning to consume cropland . In addition to the grainland shrinkage associated with the Japan syndrome , the extensive overpumping of aquifers in India-which will one day deprive farmers of irrigation water-will also reduce grain production . // The Japan Syndrome // Exactly when rapid industrialization in a country that is densely populated will translate into a decline in grain production is difficult to anticipate . Once crop production begins to decline , countries often try to reverse the trend . But the difficulty of achieving this can be seen in Japan , where a rice support price that is four times the world market price has failed to expand production . The China Factor China-the most-populous country in the world-is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall in China 's grain production since 1998 is perhaps the most alarming recent world agricultural event . After an impressive climb from 90 million tons in 1950 to a peak of 392 million tons in 1998 , China 's grain harvest fell in four of the next five years , dropping to 322 million tons in 2003 . For perspective , this decline of 70 million tons exceeds the entire grain harvest of Canada . The decline resulted when China 's farmers began converting cropland to nonfarm uses and shifting grainland to higher-value fruits and vegetables . And , as happened in Japan , better jobs in some of the more prosperous regions lured away the rural labor needed for multiple cropping , thus reducing productivity . China is also losing grainland to the expansion of deserts and the loss of irrigation water , due to both aquifer depletion and diversion of water to cities . Unfortunately for China , none of the forces that are shrinking the grainland area are easily countered . Between 1998 and 2003 , five consecutive harvest shortfalls dropped China 's once massive stocks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocks now largely depleted , China 's leaders-all of them survivors of the great famine of 1959-1961 , when 30 million people starved to death-are worried . For them , food security is not a trivial issue . China desperately wants to reverse the recent fall in grain production and has tried to encourage farmers to grow more grain . In March 2004 , Beijing expanded the agricultural budget by one-fifth ( $3.6 billion ) and raised the support price for the early rice crop by 21% . These two emergency measures did reverse the grain harvest decline temporarily , but whether they can reverse the trend over the longer term is doubtful . When China turns to the outside world for commodities , it can overwhelm world markets . When wheat prices within China started climbing in the fall of 2003 , the government dispatched wheat-buying delegations to Australia , Canada , and the United States . They purchased 8 million tons , and overnight China became the world 's largest wheat importer . China has been the world 's fastest-growing economy since 1980 , and the economic effects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . But China is also putting enormous pressure on its own natural resource base . The northern half of the country is literally drying out . Water tables are falling , rivers are going dry , and lakes are disappearing . The World Bank warns of " catastrophic consequences for future generations " if China 's water use and supply can not quickly be brought back into balance . More immediately , if China can not quickly restore a balance between the consumption of water and the sustainable yield of its aquifers and rivers , its grain imports will likely soar in the years ahead . Photograph As a bus rushes by , an Indian farmer displays her maize crop while waiting for customers on the road to Calcutta . There are signs that India may be following the economic development patterns that have made China an increasingly demanding customer in the world 's food market . // For people not living in China , it is difficult to visualize how quickly deserts are expanding . Like invading armies , expanding deserts are claiming ever more territory . Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guerrilla forces striking unexpectedly , forcing Beijing to fight on several fronts . Throughout northern and western China , some 24,000 villages have either been abandoned or partly depopulated as drifting sand has made farming untenable . China 's food problems now are not hunger and starvation , as the nation now has a substantial cushion between consumption levels and minimal nutrition needs . Rather , the concern is rising food prices and the effect that this could have on political stability . China 's leaders are striving for a delicate balance between food prices that will encourage proauction in the countryside but maintain stability in the cities . If smaller countries like Japan , South Korea , and Taiwan import 70% or more of their grain , the impacts on the global economy are not so dramatic . But if China turns to the outside world to meet even 20% of its grain needs-which would be close to 80 million tons-it will create a huge challenge for grain exporters . The resulting rise in world grain prices could destabilize governments in low-income , grainimporting countries . The entire world thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agricultural resource base . The Challenge Ahead We must not underestimate the challenges that the world faces over the next half century . There will be a projected 3 billion more people to feed , and 5 billion who will want to improve their diets by eating more meat , which requires more grain ( as livestock feed ) to produce . Meanwhile , the world 's farmers will still be fighting soil erosion and the loss of cropland to nonfarm uses , as well as newer challenges , such as falling water tables , the diversion of irrigation water to cities , and rising temperatures . The World Food Summit of 1996 in Rome set a goal of halving the number of hungry people by 2015 . That would require reducing the ranks of the hungry by 20 million a year . While some progress was made in the 1990s , it has not been enough . And things have gotten even worse : By the end of the century , the number of hungry people in the world began to increase , rising to 798 million in 2001 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lack of growth in the world grain harvest during this period . Looming over this darkening horizon is the prospect that other countries will soon fall victim to the Japan syndrome of accelerating economic growth and shrinking grain harvests . Will India 's grain production peak and start declining in the next few years , much as China 's did after 1998 ? Or will India be able to hold off the loss of cropland to non-farm uses and the depletion of aquifers long enough to eradicate most of its hunger ? There are signs that the shrinkage in India 's grain area-a precursor to the shrinkage of overall production-may have begun . Because aquifer depletion is recent , it is taking agricultural analysts into uncharted territory . Water tables are falling simultaneously in many countries and at an accelerating rate , but we can not be certain exactly when aquifers will be depleted and precisely how much this will reduce food production . And in a world of rising temperatures , there is added reason to be concerned about world food security . On another front , in Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire continent as the loss of able-bodied field workers shrinks harvests . In subSaharan Africa , disease begets hunger and hunger begets disease . In some villages , high HIV-infection rates have claimed an entire generation of young adults , leaving only the elderly and children . Without a major intervention from the outside world , the continuing spread of the virus-combined with the hunger that is cutting life expectancy in half in some countries-could take Africa back to the Dark Ages . In a world where the food economy has been shaped by an abundance of cheap oil , tightening world oil supplies will further complicate efforts to eradicate hunger . Modern mechanized agriculture requires large amounts of fuel for tractors , irrigation pumps , and grain drying . Rising oil prices may soon translate into rising food prices . Feeding the World If grain imports continue to grow in Asia , where half the world 's people live , and if harvests continue to shrink in Africa , the second-most-populous continent , we have to ask where tomorrow 's grain will come from . The countries that dominated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Canada , Australia , and Argentina-may not be able to export much beyond current levels . The United States has produced as much as 350 million tons of grain a year several times over the last two decades , though never much more than this . The country exported about 100 million tons of grain a year two decades ago , but only an average of 80 million tons in recent years , as demand has increased domestically . The potential for expanding grain production and export in both Canada and Australia is constrained by relatively low rainfall in their grain-growing regions . Argentina 's grain production has actually declined over the last several years as land has shifted to soybeans , principally used for feeding livestock rather than people . By contrast , Russia and Ukraine should be able to expand their grain exports , at least modestly , as population has stabilized or is declining . There is also some unrealized agricultural production potential in these countries . But northern countries heavily dependent on spring wheat typically have lower yields , so Russia is unlikely to become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential if it can provide farmers with the economic incentives they need to expand production . So , too , do Poland and Romania . Yet , the likely increases in exports from these countries are small compared with the prospective import needs of China and , potentially , India . It is worth noting that the drop in China 's grain harvest of 70 million tons over five years is equal to the grain exports of Canada , Australia , and Argentina combined . Argentina can expand its already large volume of soybean exports , but its growth potential for grain exports is limited by the availability of arable land . The only country that has the potential to substantially expand the world 's grainland area is Brazil , with its vast cerrado-a savannah-like region on the southern edge of the Amazon basin . Because its soils require the heavy use of fertilizer and because transporting grain from Brazil 's remote interior to distant world markets is costly , it would likely take substantially higher world grain prices for Brazil to emerge as a major exporter . Beyond this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sustainable ? Or is its vulnerability to soil erosion likely to prevent it from making a long-term contribution ? And what will be the price paid in the irretrievable loss of ecosystems and plant and animal species ? In sum , ensuring future food security is a formidable , multifaceted problem . To solve it , the world will need to : * Check the HIV epidemic before it so depletes Africa 's adult population that starvation stalks the land . * Arrest the steady shrinkage in grainland area per person . * Eliminate the overgrazing that is converting grasslands to desert . * Reduce soil erosion losses to below the natural rate of new soil formation . * Halt the advancing deserts that are engulfing cropland. * Check the rising temperature that threatens to shrink harvests . * Arrest the fall in water tables . * Protect cropland from careless conversion to nonfarm uses .
