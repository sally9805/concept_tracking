Time was , a fashion-conscious body would dare don a sweat suit only while curled up in first class . No longer . Sweats are in for the fashion cognoscenti , from smart , casual moms to partying celebrities . And for boldface types , they 're not just to own . There 's hardly a hip-hop star without an eponymous line of hoodies and pants . So who 's responsible for breathing new life into the long-reviled ensemble ? The answer depends on how far back you want to go . <P> Like its cousin the sneaker , the tracksuit came into the fashion mainstream via the street , through hip-hop and rave culture . The sweat suit became a B-boy uniform partly because disco gear did not lend itself to the gymnastics of break dancing . Another influence : music legends like Bob Marley , who adopted sweats as a uniform ( and may have been drawing on the much iconized image of tracksuit-clad John Carlos and Tommie Smith giving black-power salutes at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics ) . <P> But the tipping point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-profile stylish women  --  in the fall of 2001 . Fashion is a game in which alpha-dog celebrities stay ahead of middle-class consumers , often by mimicking inner-city teenagers and other transgressive subcultures . Madonna 's bold use of classic Adidas roused a posse of A-list imitators ranging from Gwyneth Paltrow and Cameron Diaz to Pink . J. Lo made the pastel Juicy Couture velour sweat suit a must-have item , then started producing her own . <P> And apres J. Lo , le deluge : there were sweats-inspired looks on the runway at Ralph Lauren , Prada and Valentino . The wheel has come full circle . At the most recent haute couture shows , the folks from Juicy Couture announced they would soon release a tracksuit for ( gasp ! ) men .  --  By Tony Karon
