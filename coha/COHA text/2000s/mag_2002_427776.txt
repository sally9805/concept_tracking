It gives you confidence , understanding , and  --  sometimessaves you money . // AIthough I slapped cheap bikes together for two summers , I 've never considered myself a pro wrench . Those guys out in the shops , grinding grit into their whorls and banging skin off their hands while performing ordinary miracles every hour-they 're a whole different breed . I 'm closer to who most of you are . I 've become a way-better-than  --  average home mechanic-I 'm the guy a lot of people ask for advice now-but it was n't long apo that , instead of being clamped into a Park Tool stand , my work bikes were strewn around the livingroom floor . My tool inventory : an incomplete set of hex wrenches . And my repair was often worse than the original problem . Some of us are even worse  --  we long to improve our mechanical skills to incompetent . I 'm here to tell you there 's hope for any of us . And a reason to try . A while ago I served as team mechanic when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 24 Hours of Allamuchy . A wheel rebuild at 3 in the morning , with the only focused light source clamped between my teeth . A derailleur hanger that bent a new way every lap-screwing up the shifting of our fastest rider . Broken chainring teeth that had to be reshaped with a portable Dremel before they 'd catch the chain . And the routine maintenance after every lap-31 tune-ups in 24 hours . Around 10 a.m. , like a galley slave crawling to the deck for a glimpse of the ocean , I stumbled away from the workstand and down to the start line . I ran into a reader who I think was named Ron . ( Details , like my head , were fuzzy . ) He 'd been doing the wrench thing , too . You could just tell . We talked a little . I told him I could n't believe I 'd done it . " Me neither , " said Ron . " I 'm really not that good . I do n't like fixing bikes in some abstract sense , like some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I savor knowing I know how my bike works , and that it 's solid and secure because I made it that way . Sometimes I fool myself that my wrenching saves money . ( Factor the cost of tools and supplies , plus my time , as well as when I bung up something that costs more than what I was trying to fix , and it 's at least a wash . ) I also dig the confidence that I can remedy almost any mid-ride breakdown . But , like Ron , I do n't truly love wrenching itself . I do n't enjoy doing it-I enjoy having done it , having done a good thing for other people who ride . It 's a small satisfaction , and in today 's world , a tiny good deed like tightening a headset is n't much . But it 's something . And it 's something any of us can learn to do . I did . You can . Of course it 's not enough . It 's ludicrous to imagine that learning how to figure out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . And yet And yet , it does . Ridiculous , huh ?
