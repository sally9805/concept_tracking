<p> Ronald and Kathleen Busse were flush with pride at the birth of their firstborn on Feb. 17 , 1942 . Jerry Wayne , they named him - in honor of two of his uncles . <p> Their bright-eyed baby made small strides in those first few months . But when he began to lag far behind the usual milestones , the young couple grew concerned . <p> " I knew when he was about a year old , " Kathleen Busse recalls wistfully . By his first birthday , Jerry was still struggling to crawl when he should have been trying to walk . <p> Doctors confirmed their fears - Jerry was severely mentally retarded , with an IQ of just 29 . <p> The Busses , who never learned the cause of Jerry 's retardation , accepted the news as best they could , with the strength of their faith and support from friends and relatives . <p> Between 1944 and 1951 , Jerry was joined by three brothers and a sister , and life on the family 's southeastern Indiana dairy farm settled into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those closest to the couple urged them to place Jerry in a state institution . Do yourselves and your children a favor , they suggested . <p> The Busses rejected the advice . They loved Jerry and wanted him to have as normal a life as possible . When he turned 6 , they enrolled him in the first grade . But after three days , the principal called to say it would n't work , Jerry was disrupting the class . <p> " So we took him home and said , ' We 'll just love him and care for him and do what we can for him - because he 's ours , " ' Kathleen says . <p> Jerry is one of an estimated 1.89 million Americans with developmental disabilities cared for by a parent or other relative , according to a 1998 report by the University of Illinois at Chicago . About 480,000 of these " children " are 60 or older , and their parents are now in their 70s , 80s or older . <p> These parents face growing health woes even as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - a lifetime of work that has saved the government untold millions . <p> Yet when they finally seek help , they learn that there is a nationwide shortage of safe , secure housing with supervised care for the disabled . <p> Although about 80,000 families nationwide are languishing on state-maintained waiting lists for services for the disabled , many others have never sought help from social service agencies . They , like Kathleen Busse , fear for what will become of their children . <p> Despite her energetic , cheerful nature , Kathleen , now 78 , has grown increasingly weary of caring for Jerry since her husband died 10 years ago . High blood pressure and arthritis are slowing her down . <p> At 59 , Jerry has the mind of a child , but is balding , stands 5-foot-9 1/2 and weighs 200 pounds . He has always relied on his mother to prepare his meals , wash his laundry , shave him , help him bathe and get dressed . In return , Jerry has had one daily chore : retrieving the mail from the mailbox . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake , he has spent countless hours in a playroom equipped with a television and a toybox brimming with model cars and stuffed animals . <p> As Kathleen chatted with a visitor earlier this year , Jerry sat quietly in his easy chair , until the theme song to " Gomer Pyle , U.S.M.C. " began playing on his playroom TV . <p> Hearing the song , he bolted from the chair to watch the opening scene , with Jim Nabors saluting with a toothy grin . Before the song faded , Jerry was raiding his toy chest , digging his way past a stuffed tiger , a can of marbles , a plastic Cincinnati Reds mug and dozens of toy cars . <p> Unearthing a stuffed weasel that talks when its belly is squeezed , he returned to the living room and plopped down into his easy chair , which sits next to his mother 's , an end table between them . <p> His face - tight , smiling and lined with wrinkles - slowly relaxed as he rocked contentedly with his toy , oblivious to the cares of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good life , " Kathleen says . " I think he 's happy . " <p> Growing up on his parents ' Decatur County dairy farm , Jerry never lacked for companionship . His three brothers and sister were always around . <p> But it was n't long before his younger siblings passed him up . <p> " It was like he was our older brother and then gradually he became the younger brother . We all looked out for him . That 's just the way it always was , " says Jack Busse , 54 , who shares guardianship of Jerry with his mother . <p> In the Busse household everyone , except Jerry , worked to earn money for a college education . The boys had a summer lawn-mowing service and after Ronald quit dairy farming in the 1950s to start a fishing lure business , the family spent hours together crafting lures . <p> Kathleen added to the income by working in a school cafeteria and a drugstore ; she also started a large garden and canned vegetables to help stretch the family budget . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including autumn treks into the woods to collect hickory nuts for Kathleen 's holiday pies and cookies . One of the family 's favorite excursions was to southeastern Indiana 's shady river valleys , where they went searching for colorful riverstones and geodes - bland , globular stones that when smashed open reveal glittering crystals . <p> " Sometimes we 'd put so many stones in the car we 'd have to drive real slow over railroad tracks , " Kathleen recalls . " I was afraid the bottom of the car might fall out . " <p> By the early 1970s , Jerry 's four younger siblings went off to college . Soon , they were married , leaving Jerry alone with his parents . <p> Once the children left the nest , Ronald and Kathleen were never able to vacation together again ; one of them always had to stay behind to watch Jerry . Ronald went on fishing trips with his buddies to prime fishing spots in Canada . Kathleen would take bus trips , seeing the sights from the window of a Greyhound bus with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the couple still had fun on their solo trips . " You really do n't remember the things you were n't able to do as much as you do the good times , " Kathleen says . <p> Bad times arrived in the 1980s , when Ronald was diagnosed with lung cancer . He fought it off twice with radiation and chemotherapy , but when it returned a third time , there was little doctors could do . Ronald died in 1991 , the year of the couple 's 50th wedding anniversary . <p> Kathleen did n't take Jerry to the funeral ; she knew he could n't understand the concept of death . Even today , a decade later , Jerry will sometimes ask out of the blue : " Mommy , Daddy dead ? " <p> " I 'll say , ' Yes he 's gone , Jerry , and he 's not coming home , " ' Kathleen says . <p> After Ronald died , Kathleen sold their home in Forest Hill , Ind. , and most of its contents . She saved a few of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walnut cabinet , a pine chest with a hidden compartment and a jeweler 's bench with tiny drawers . <p> Kathleen and Jerry moved to nearby North Vernon , settling into the furnished mobile home that had been her husband 's weekend fishing retreat . The sidewalk leading to the house still contains a loving reminder of Ronald - a mosaic of an owl that he crafted from riverstones , with marbles for its eyes . <p> After 10 years alone with Jerry , Kathleen took the first steps last fall toward putting his name on a state waiting list for a group home . It 's time , her children insisted . <p> She was told it would be two to four years before a space might open up in a home with supervised care . <p> It happened far sooner . <p> Early this year , Kathleen learned about an opening at a group home in Trafalgar , Ind. , about 35 miles from her home . Jerry 's Medicaid eligibility and his mother 's immediate needs won him the spot . <p> March 2 was moving day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his truck - among them a life-sized cutout of John Wayne that had once stood watch over Jerry 's bedroom . <p> As mother and two sons rode to the powder blue vinyl-sided home on a quiet street near a Dairy Queen , Kathleen tried to soothe Jerry 's concerns by explaining that they were going to " Jerry 's little blue house . " <p> There , Jerry joined seven other developmentally disabled adults , who are watched over by a 24-hour staff . <p> Managers at the group home asked the Busses not to visit Jerry for the first month to give him time to acclimate to his new surroundings . As days stretched into weeks , though , Jerry apparently thought he had been abandoned . <p> When Kathleen and Jack were finally reunited with him in early April , at a meeting in a nearby city , Jerry 's blue-gray eyes filled with tears and he sobbed . He ran to Kathleen 's car and begged to be taken home . <p> She quickly defused the outburst by asking Jerry if she could go with him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boots the staff had bought for him . <p> " It was like a switch was turned off , " she says . " He got into the van and we followed him back to the home . All he wanted was to have us come and see him and to be with us . " <p> On her next meeting with Jerry , Kathleen brought her son a cowboy hat that had remained behind in his old bedroom . While Jerry sat on the edge of his bed , repeatedly trying on his favorite hat and gleefully hooking it onto his bedpost , she unpacked summer short-sleeved shirts from home . <p> While Jerry knows now that his mother will be visiting him , he has yet to fully accept his new home , or his 71-year-old roommate , who gets around in a wheelchair . But Jerry keeps busy there ; step by step , staff members are encouraging him to do things for himself . <p> On Kathleen 's second visit to the home , Jerry was taciturn .

And she 's planning a trip to Florida to visit a brother she has n't seen since 1997 . " I 've had a very fruitful life , and Jerry has been a big part of it .
