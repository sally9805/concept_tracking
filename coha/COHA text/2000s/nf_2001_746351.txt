Divination is more dialogical than some diviners or anthropologists have made it appear . I analyze the transcript of one Bangladeshi divination event , comparing it with a dozen others performed by one diviner , Delwar , revealing how tenuously he manages to assign a single meaning to troubles , especially when clients openly compare his declarations with their intimate knowledge of those troubles . I explain how divinations could appear to be texts rather than emergent products of interaction . Diviners entextualize their declamations , doing their best to keep context at bay . Anthropologists who concentrate on textual products of divination - like Delwar 's declamations - have made divination appear to enable groups to manage conflicts by transcending personal intentionality . Such representations elide troublesome interactive processes in which declamations emerge , meet potential rejection by clients , and are always vulnerable to recontextualizalion as clients might return to the diviner as events shift their perception of earlier divinations ' accuracy . <p> divination ; dialogism ; entexualization ; conflict ; South Asia <p> This article presents an interpretation of divination as dialogic , interactive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , divination is one of several practices by which troubles are interpreted and the " underlying causes " that are divined become potential social facts . Divination thus is one of a number of practice-genres ( Hanks 1996 ) for managing questions and troubles ; others include astrology , palmistry , exorcism , and traditional medicine . Such practices predate and differ from , but are increasingly being brought into line with , reformist Islam . Troubles talk and troubles management in ritual , medical , and everyday contexts occupied me during my fieldwork in 1992 and 1996 , and were the subject of my first book ( Wilce 1998b ) . <p> In a subheading of that book , I placed divination events " outside the dialogical pattern " that holds in most " problem-solving " encounters , such as those between biomedical practitioners and their patients . That perspective was limiting . In this article I uncover the multiple ways in which the divination encounters which one Delwar Kari has with his clients are quite dialogical ; they are constructed with the substantial participation of those clients . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divined knowledge appears spotty . After presenting an outline distilled from analyzing a dozen divination encounters , I analyze one in detail . First , however , I describe the Bangladeshi context for divinations as encounters that are not only aimed at divining and managing troubles . They are themselves laden with potential troubles - troubles inherent in divining , that is , divining troubles ( if you follow my use of contrastive stress patterns I would use to link and distinguish the two phrases ) . Divination and Rural Bangladesh <p> Divination is a genre of interpretive discourse . Bangladeshis have described several forms for me , and at least one novelistic account of a form of divination is also available in Bangla ( Ishaque 1955 ) , the dominant language of Bangladesh . Bangladeshi divination fits the general description offered by John DuBois : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> DuBois distinguishes " mechanical " from " mental " divination processes . The latter would include trance-possession , in which a spirit reveals the nature of a problem ( the very form of divination described in Ishaque 's 1955 novel ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing lots . Both mechanical and mental forms are evident in Bangladesh . The cause of a mysterious event may be uncovered by a spirit speaking through a trance-medium such as Shefali , whom I describe elsewhere ( Wilce 1998b , 1998a : 236 ) . The difference between the mechanical and mental forms should not be overdrawn . DuBois 's statement that " Divination means that no-one will have to be the personal source of a decision " clearly applies to both . Still , their relation can be fraught with ideological conflict . To at least one man who practices divination in the same Matlab marketplace where the diviner in focus in this article - Delwar Kari - plies his trade , the Bangla word for diviner , ganak , connotes only a mental or " psychological " sort of trick . AH is critical of such tricks , preferring a mechanical process . He blows on a string and wraps it around the wrist of a patient whose symptoms might indicate spirit influence . The string 's later behavior divines the difference between illnesses caused by spirit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Qur'anic verses encased in amulets ( to be worn around the neck , waist or wrist ) for the former , and cosmopolitan pharmaceuticals for the latter . <p> DuBois argues that divination centering on an " aleatory mechanism " - like Delwar Kari 's divinatory calculations based on the letters of a client 's name rendered into Arabic - suspends intentionality but certainly not social functionality . In the suspension of intentionality is its genius , writes DuBois . To me , even inquiring of a spirit is a divination process " dependent on uncertain contingencies " and thus aleatory , and thus the sort of genius DuBois attributes to divination applies to it as well . He continues , PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> DuBois then approvingly cites Victor Turner 's opinion that divination " brings to light and so dispels the quarrels and grudges in the social group " ( Turner 1975 : 245 ) . DuBois concludes that divination " may function , in concert with any ritual it prescribes , to resolve interpersonal conflicts " ( 1992 : 64 ) . <p> I will argue that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of presenting " divination " as " texts . " To the extent that DuBois presents transcripts of divination texts as final products , he prevents readers from seeing their emergence through processes of entextualization . " Text " is a coherent set of signs ( Hanks 1988 ) , " discourse rendered decontextualizable " ( Bauman and Briggs 1990 : 73 ) . Discourse that calls attention to itself , for example , by its poetic qualities , performance that " puts the act of speaking on display " ( as , in truth , all performance does p. 73 ) , is memorable , repeatable , decontextualizable . But to treat discourse as if it were already text , as if performers did not strive to poetically package their words , or to produce a monologue impenetrable with questions or challenges , is to beg the question . This is what DuBois 's article seems to do . <p> Further , I argue that DuBois 's model - as a version of Turner 's particular sort of functionalism - does not fit Bangladeshi divination . But , apart from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divination - especially shamanic divination in the Amazon - problematize Turner 's model . It certainly fails to describe the rancorous dialogue between shaman-diviner Yankush and his none-too-trusting clients in the Amazon in Michael F. Brown 's representation of " shamanism and its discontents " ( 1988 ) . What Yankush " sees " is vigorously questioned , and his clients openly raise the possibility that his " sight " is clouded by his own side-practice as a sorcerer . Brown 's argument is that the symbolic acts of such shamans ( including those of a divinatory-diagnostic sort ) merely reproduce tensions , " shifting the locus of uncertainty from the body to the body politic " ( p. 117 ) . I will argue that the unsettling nature of divination events makes a new , more dialogical , understanding mandatory . <p> " Liakot 's " family - friends of mine in Dhaka - told me how they consulted a woman in their ancestral village an hour outside the city . They saw her as a sort of counter-sorcerer , asking her to cure their relative Liakot . That young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards , had made a friend into an enemy by asking , then demanding , that the friend repay Liakot a very large sum of money . The new enemy then hired a sorcerer , whose curse made Liakot go mad . Liakot 's family hired the woman first to divine the reason for his madness . After I had heard their story , I asked whether , as part of the cure , the debt was repaid . It was not . Neither the debt nor the restoration of Liakot 's relationship with his former friend was an important goal , at least in their narrative of the diviner/healer who cured Liakot 's madness . That cure itself was evidently the sole objective , though the divination was an important part of it ( Wilce 1998b : 157 ) . It could be argued that the cure 's " function " was still to restore harmony . But to do so would certainly be ignoring the pressing concerns expressed by the family - which , as Wikan ( 1990 ) argues , we ought not do - and I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case because of its relevance to the functionalist interpretation of divination and healing . It has another lesson to offer , in relation to gender and the healing arts as commercial practices . There are other women besides Liakot 's curer who practice various forms of healing and divination in Bangladesh . But I know of no cases of women who had their own stalls in marketplaces at the time of his cure ( the early 1980s ) . Unfortunately I have lost touch with Liakot 's family , and I never asked them about the setting in which their female counter-sorcerer practiced . But I have every reason to believe that she , like some elderly women in my adopted Bangladesh village of Baghmar ( in the Chandpur subdistrict of Matlab Wilce 1998b : 4-6 , 156 ) , practiced out of her home in a noncommercial way . Exorcists and possession-mediums ( for example , Shefali ) also practice in their homes . Men practice mechanical sorts of divination in market stalls in the Matlab area ; no women , and no practitioners of " mental " forms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that changed hands in each of the videotaped encounters was about the equivalent of the fee charged by village daktars , and diviners and daktars are both able to live well from their earnings , relative to their neighbors. 1 Delwar Kari 's Form of Divination <p> One local form of divination in Bangladesh renders the names of " patient " and patient 's mother into Arabic and then proceeds to a kind of numerological divination on the letters . In the case of our protagonist , divination is a writing-intensive process . In 1992 and 1996 I observed and/or recorded a dozen divinations on four occasions by Delwar Kari . Delwar 's practice is located close to the town of Matlab , the " seat " of whatever government ( namely , a police station , thana , which gives this level of political administration its generic name ) exists in that subdistrict of Chandpur , Bangladesh . His title , karl , bestows on him an air of Islamic respectability . Etymologically , the Arabic word indicates - how accurately in this case I know not - the ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bangladeshi , sense indicates the knowledge of Islamic lore . The ritual use of the signs of literacy , such as the ink of copied Qur'anic verses and the letters of personal names and the number values to which they conventionally correspond , is common to the divination and exorcism practiced in other Muslim societies . <p> Delwar Kari 's procedure is stereotyped . This reflects , in part , the fact that his divinations are " mechanical . " ( Though there are also ritualized dimensions of " mental " forms of divination such as trance-possession , the form and content of the spirit 's speech at the revelatory highlight of such an event is , in rural Bangladesh , not the predictable part of the event . ) My transcripts of a dozen divination encounters recorded across several occasions ( six each in 1992 and 1996 ) give me a clear vision of their structure , which I have outlined below . The encounters unfold thusly . Delwar 's clients sit in his stall in the bazaar , the marketplace . After some small talk he asks them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient 's mother 's name . These names he transforms into their numerological values. 2 That is , by an esoteric process , he compares a numeric precipitate of the two names with a paradigm of values partly stored in his memory , partly calculated , thereby divining the problem and its underlying cause . Though clients are motivated to visit Delwar by highly contextualized and specific problems - from mood shifts and diarrhea in 1992 to apparent breakdowns just before school exams , or tensions in a new marriage , in 1996 - the cause Delwar discovers beneath them never changes . Whatever sort of problem they present , clients are told that someone has conspired against them ( or against the rogi whose name they have presented to Delwar ) by planting a series of tabiz against them . In Bangla discourse , tabiz ( Arabic ta'wiz ) refers both to protective amulets and to items and acts used in sorcery . What Delwar unearths ( first rhetorically , then literally ) is the presence of aggressive , harmful tabiz . <p> Delwar 's declamations follow the predictable form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the concept of " text " as a coherent and decontextualizable set of signs does not capture the event completely , since the very formula includes at least one opening for response ( Section F , +/- Section B ) . And therein lies the emergent , dialogic potential of this small piece of culture . <p> Figure 1 . Declaiming the Results of Divination Delwar 's Formula ( distilled from a dozen examples ) ( italicized items appear only in transcripts of 1992 encounters ) PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Section C is the heart of the divinatory pronouncement and includes identification of the sorcerers and their aims . Delwar never names names . On the other hand , ever the numerologist , he always specifies how many women and men came together in a plot against the poor soul whose name is presented , whose true state is divined , and whose problems will be revealed . Delwar most commonly mentions two women coming together as sorcerers , joined later by one man . In about half of the cases , another feature of the sorcerers is revealed : their light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desirable trait , sometimes foregrounded as a kind of symbolic capital in marriage ads which appear in South Asian newspapers even in the diaspora , or in face-to-face premarital negotiation between two families . But calling the sorcerers fair-skinned means they are objects and agents of jealousy , hinsa . <p> In section C5 , Delwar makes known their aims . Aims mentioned more than once in my corpus of 12 divinations include " just for the conspiracy of it , " " wrecking marriages " ( whether before or after they are consecrated is not clear ) , and " exercising control over the victim " ( something like voudou ) . Aims mentioned only once include " sheer enmity , " " envy " of the victim 's possessions , and a desire " to destroy the victim 's reputation " or to " light a fire in this family . " The community tensions thematized in discourses surrounding sorcery are , thus , similar to those in other communities experiencing rapid change , new forms of stratification , and new possibilities for the accumulation of wealth ( see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as people seek out expert help in the face of such tensions and are prepared to accept a fundamental link between the social and the personal or even bodily , biomedicine 's hegemony will be incomplete . <p> To put flesh on the bones of the outline in Figure 1 , here is a translation of one encounter involving a husband ( M ) and wife ( W ) presented Delwar ( D ) with a set of problems . The transcript begins at the point in the encounter when he pronounces the divination . He had been speaking in a normal tone of voice but shifts at line 1 , his loudness , intonation , and articulation marking this section off as " not conversational . " Delwar Gives the Results of a Divination4 PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> At this point Delwar makes a transition toward a moment when he expects interaction with his clients . He signals that by speaking in a less deliberate , lower tone of voice . In the lines transcribed below , he framed his speech as conversational ; he was no longer declaiming . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the response he has markedly elicited by lowering his tone and by looking up . Actually , the marked upward turn of his gaze - toward the woman - occurs just before she responds in line 33 . After her brief response , he turns away , though line 34 indicates she has not said all she needs to say . The Troubles Delwar Divined <p> Analyzing videotapes I made of the diviner Delwar Kari in 1996 and comparing them with those I had shot in 1992 uncovered both continuities and contrasts . Both sets of tapes reveal a formulaic declamation of the results of a numerological sort of calculation process , one that he has kept shrouded in mystery . The formulaic declamation , however , is public . Given biomedicine 's rapid ascent to hegemony in Delwar 's area of Bangladesh ( beginning in the 1960s but taking off in the late 80s ) , it is probably no accident that 1996 divinations no longer concerned the sicknesses that dominated Delwar 's 1992 divinations . Instead , those who brought names for divining problems in 1996 were concerned about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing that had not changed since 1992 was that Delwar uncovered sorcery behind all problems . Why should people seek out the services of a man whom they must know finds a sorcerer under every bush ? It is because Delwar is an astute interpreter . But what does divination interpret ? Ostensibly , Delwar does not interpret illnesses or other problems , since he is only given a person 's name and no information about the problem . Instead , Delwar is an astute interpreter of village social life and social organization . " He interprets people 's own world to them in a distanced fashion that will allow them to see things that are so close to them that they can not perceive them under ordinary circumstances . " 6 Diviners of his stripe are , as it were , moonlighting structuralist anthropologists . Delwar 's numerological algorithm must produce outcomes that mirror local models of community , person , and gender . Regarding community , Delwar 's pronouncements indirectly index the same critical evaluation of the national self which I heard people voice on those numerous occasions when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bangladeshis often told me that their communities were endlessly capable of hinsa . Hinsa 's common gloss as " envious hatred " does not capture the sense it carries of superior feeling , stratifying tendencies , class-consciousness , " a tendency to make invidious comparisons and set up divisions in order to have someone to look down on . " <p> If village communities are endlessly capable of hinsa , persons , in the model Delwar draws upon , are endlessly vulnerable , socially entanglable , physically penetrable - " dividual " in the sense given by South Asianists ( Marriott 1976 ) . At the same time , Delwar 's form of divination is in two senses a discourse on agency . First , it shares with other forms of divination an overt attempt to escape from human intentionality ( DuBois 1992 ) . Divination only works by suspending the intentionality of client and diviner . In their differing roles , both assume the stance of recipients of the truth that is revealed . On the other hand , Delwar discovers sorcery - which is at once the opposite and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can recast Marriott 's ( 1976 ) concept as vulnerability . Sorcery asserts hyper-agency , as Briggs points out in relation to shamanism and its discourses ( 1992 ) . In a society that frowns upon strong assertion of individual plans , especially in the absence of " if God wills , " those who reach out and magically control others ' futures through sorcery appear hyper-agentive indeed . <p> The construction of personhood in Delwar 's divination texts hinges in part on a grammar of agency . He does not claim to know the name of the women and men behind the curses . Still , he shows respect for their agency , shifting from an unmarked to an honorific form of third person agreement marking in reference to them . This shift he makes , in particular , when talking about their power to simply blow a charm toward the victim over the wind . These texts frequently alternate between active and passive constructions of the same event - describing sorcerers and grammaticalizing their work in active voice at one moment , then foregrounding the act and dropping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the shift will only be uncovered with further analysis . <p> Delwar typically divines the problems of absent " patients , " if we can call them that , or " troubles owners " ( as opposed to troubles tellers , Wilce 1998b ) . In only one case I taped did a client present her own name for some problem to be divined . Often , the names presented for divination are those of adult children . Elderly parents , acting as Delwar 's clients , present their names . Parents must integrate what Delwar says with their own observations of signs or symptoms and a range of other diagnoses from herbalists , exorcists , homeopaths , and allopaths . This is divination ; I have no evidence that parent-clients described symptoms before the divinatory pronouncement . It is important to keep that in mind as we analyze the symptoms Delwar attributed to the extremely gender-marked male or female names that clients gave him . All the clients gave him was the name , but the name gives away gender . Thus , the symptoms he divines must fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sorcery that Delwar divines do resonate with clients ; after all , Delwar 's occupation requires that he understand his clients better than even local sociologists might . His pronouncements are collective representations , reproducing images not only of community and person but most particularly of gendered persons . It is more often the female sorcerers who , he says , are fair-skinned . That resonates with clients insofar as fair skin might be a desired and thus a resented trait , thus attracting to itself the projection of hostility or , even more paradoxically , hinsa , jealousy ( LeVine 1982 ; Toelken 1987 ) . As for the victims , Delwar may attribute a hot temper to male or female names . However , it is no accident that he ascribed the traits of moodiness and indecisiveness to two different female names , never to males . Given that even Bangladeshi academics unreflectively ascribed to women an excess of emotion ( Wilce 1998b : 271 , n. 17 , n. 18 ) , the cultural model is clear enough . Troubles with Delwar 's Divinations : Dialogical Indeterminacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear to be endpoints in the interpretive process . I can not speak about the secrets of the midpoints of that process , about the esoteric algorithms that allow Delwar to turn a Bangladeshi name derived from Arabic into numerological signs and , finally , a pronouncement . But in fact the pronouncement or declamation is not the endpoint . Delwar 's clients share a sense of the pronouncement as the first member of an adjacency pair ( Sacks , Schegloff , and Jefferson 1974 ) , 8 and a sense of the preferred form of their response . Their response is called for , and the preferred response is agreement . Close inspection of each event , however , shows the contingency of the process by which such divinations might become social facts , especially when the diviner invites the client-parents ' agreement with his pronouncement . These parents must judge how closely the divination matches their children 's problems . Delwar can not constrain their agreement with his pronouncements . <p> When Delwar is done taking the names and using the modality of writing to calculate the cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaks loudly and slowly in a bookish sort of register . The shift in voice quality entails a shift in Bakhtinian voice , from an everyday , engaged voice to the voice of authority . Delwar signals by this shift that this is a monologic moment in the divination process. 9 Formulaicity is a particular framing device , one which typifies the process which Bauman and Briggs call entextualization ( 1990 ) . 10 Delwar certainly makes his divinations memorable , text-like - but also decontextualizable - by forcing them into a structure full of parallelism , repetition , and predictability . As Bauman and Briggs argue , the ability to retain some control over texts as they travel between contexts is power indeed . How firm is Delwar 's grip on the discourse ? Is his " text " beyond interruption or question , safe from being thrown back in his face in the ultimate sort of recontextualization by others ? <p> The monologic moment passes when life in the bazaar , and the demands of sociality , press in upon textuality . Texts are neat , but only exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delwar 's encounter with the couple , still concerned about their children , includes an interruption when the bazaar pressed in on the trio 1 was videotaping in Delwar 's market stall . Just before speaking the words transcribed as line 40 ( to reflect the gap between it and the last line of the segment above , numbered 36 ) , Delwar looked up suddenly to address a man passing by in the bazaar . PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> After the brief interruption represented above , Delwar returned his attention to the papers lying before him on the floor of his stall , and to his clients . PREFORMATTED TABLE Dialogical Features of This Divination <p> As we review the transcript , presented in several episodes above , we find that the lines I present open with a monologically structured episode - lines 1-26 . But the larger encounter of which Delwar 's relatively monologic declamation is a part can be " interrupted " both by interaction with non-participant passersby , and by non-scripted interaction between Delwar and his clients . Delwar takes several steps to entextualize his pronouncement in monologic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his authoritative calculation paper , and following a formula ( Figure 1 ) of internal repetition ( for example , in the listing of charms distributed in various sites ) . These measures , which define entextualization , make the formal organization of his speech as oral text obvious to listeners . Despite these efforts , the divination remains contextualized and dialogical in several ways . <p> First , Delwar invites a limited sort of dialogue ; it is built into the very structure of his declamations ( Figure 1 , part F ) . Lines 27-35 represent that Part F. But they also illustrate the limits of a structuralist analysis of events like this . No such models can capture what happened in those lines , namely , the evolution of the divination from monologic declamation to emergent , unscripted dialogue . Delwar came to a self-conscious pause in line 31 , and looked up , expecting and indeed inviting interaction . Admittedly , the particular sort of interaction he invites is a confirmation of the truth of what he had revealed - seeking , it seems , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1995 : 4 ) . Delwar receives that confirmation , in line 32 , from the mother . <p> In some of the divination events I recorded , such a confirmation was , for all intents and purposes , the endpoint of the encounter . Or so it appeared to me in 1992 ; I do not know what other encounters with the same clients followed the ones I taped . But in the 1996 encounter transcribed here , tension ebbed and flowed in a more complex pattern . In line 32 Delwar stretched as if he were then able to relax after a moment of tension , a moment in which his work could have been rejected . At that moment , the declamation of lines 12-26 would seem to have been interactively declared complete , finalized ( Hanks 1996 : chapter 10 ) . Those lines reflect a rather rapid divination of troubles relating to quite a few loved ones . But , reviewing that portion of the videotape from the vantage point of lines 50-64 , Delwar 's rapid delivery and flat tone take on new significance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automatic . And that did not seem to satisfy the couple before him . The divination that might have been " finished " earlier was instead filled with a new tension seeking a new resolution . This couple was still unhappy enough to insist , in line 53 , that Delwar individuate a divination for each person for whom they had a concern , and to pay him more for it . Lines 51-64 highlight the father insisting on a separate divination for Muezzim , who is - literally , the father implies - losing his mind preparing for his BA exam . <p> Thus there is a second sort of dialogical potential in divinations - the potential for dissatisfaction , leading to revision . In general , it appears that clients who are willing to pay Delwar more can ask for such a revision , or at least an expansion . If he has lumped several of their concerns about loved ones together , they may insist that he disaggregate them , as they did by requesting a special divination for Muezzim alone . Delwar 's revelation that " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( line 58 ) sheds light on the nature of divination as dialogue . Taking line 58 together with the earlier declamation , we see that what Delwar reveals about anyone ( for example , Muezzim ) is not just determined by the process internal to divination per se . Dialogue enters in , too . It was only when dialogically prompted that Delwar went on to reveal something more typically included in all of his 1992 divinations - the role of a " loose " spirit ( see Figure 1 , C6 ) . Thus , the construction of a divination is not necessarily any less interactive than the construction of a sentence in normal conversation ( Goodwin 1979 ) . <p> Delwar not only mentioned something " loose " upon Muezzim as a response to the couple 's concern . He also performed another divination , for which they paid an additional charge . And he uncovered more trouble-causing items . In fact , in a sort of dramatic climax or denouement , Delwar produced a bag containing several charms of the aggressive sort , with dirt still clinging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clients ' courtyard . After reading a text designed to take away the curse attaching to the charm , Delwar took one of the charms , blew on it , and put it back in a container , pushing it down as if it were a cigarette butt . Regarding the soil clinging to it , he declared , " This is the soil of that place . " The vague demonstrative was evidently meant to be interpreted as referring to the soil of the clients ' own courtyard . And with that , at least for that day , the tension ebbed away in a " final " sense . What I do not know , however , is the degree to which this act of revelation - like shamanic revelations in the Amazon described by Brown ( 1988 ) - simply projected tension and uncertainty from the realm of the boy , his body-mind , his madness , and his family to a larger social domain of neighbors , the domain of hinsa . <p> I can point more allusively to further evidence of the dialogism of divination events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , when Delwar pauses in his monologue , as if intentionally , clients sometimes fill in information he is missing . Information thus supplied is often the amount of time the yet-to-be-declared problem has been going on . ( See line A2 in Figure 1 ) . My last piece of evidence indicates another sort of dialogism , namely , intertextuality. 13 There is reason to believe that no divination event stands on its own ; all such events are intertextual . Each has significant precontexts , even if Delwar is not supposed to know those by normal means . And each divination is potentially a text to be cited critically in a " you divined this , but this happened , and now what ? " sort of exchange between Delwar and an unsatisfied client . I have recorded two such " follow-up visits , " one a revisit by a client to Delwar , the other my own visit to one of his clients ' homes . On the day of the divination discussed above , another woman came to Delwar about another adult child . Unlike the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few days before . Their second interchange was not harmonious . They reached some kind of compromise or understanding when Delwar performed another divination to see what other causes he had missed lurking behind this woman 's adult child - why the child had , in fact , run away and had still not been found . <p> The other " revisit " was my own . In 1992 I visited the home of yet another woman who had brought Delwar her son 's name . There in her house I heard the story of the son , Kalam , and met him in the company of his mother ( Delwar 's client ) , who was surrounded by children and male kin . An uncle showed me Kalam 's problem , getting down on the ground and acting out what was obviously a seizure . The family , who had taken Kalam to a number of different kinds of practitioners ( allopaths as well as the diviner ) , felt as though none of them had " caught " the problem and given an effective treatment . True , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the potential was there , and it seems the social atmosphere in 1996 allowed such potential greater expression . Conclusion <p> How could we think that any interpretive practice could be reduced to a text , a monologue ? Somehow the exotica with which we anthropologists concern ourselves - sorcerers and their power , for instance - cloud not only Muezzin 's or Liakot 's minds but our own. 14 Thus , for several years I myself was ensorcelled , having allowed Delwar 's entextualization to bewitch me . I thought of divination as outside the dialogic paradigm of the other " medical " ( or , more accurately , " problem-solving " ) encounters I describe elsewhere ( Wilce 1998b ) . Of course , Delwar does try to keep dialogism at bay , and probably has enough success at that as to be the envy of any biomedical practitioner in Bangladesh or the U.S. who might wish for greater passive " compliance " on the part of patients ( Kuipers 1989 ) . But there is plenty of dialogism in this interpretive process. 15 I see in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style and content . It changes from confident declaration of even the symptoms being experienced by the target of the divination , to slightly quieter tones and a different focus in 1996 . Even that shift testifies to the dialogic nature of his divinatory encounters . Clients simply do not want their diviner involved in acute illness anymore . Delwar , as I now see , is interrupted and even harassed by clients , especially by those who return for a second round of divining troubles. 16 <p> It seems to me - as it did to Brown ( 1988 ) and Briggs ( 1992 ) in their Amazonian context - that such encounters barely keep a lid on a cauldron , and that this is less " their function " than an always contingent achievement within the structure of divination encounters . The anxieties of parents constantly threaten to bubble over . The tensions and hostilities between neighboring families , which Bangladeshis seem to imagine so easily ( and perhaps accurately ) are " managed " by affirmation rather than denial . Delwar does nothing to discourage neighbors from seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the interpretation that emerges therefrom as a candidate social fact , puts some closure on issues at least for the moment . I have never heard of any remedy ( like violence ) being sought against sorcerers other than that which Delwar offers - unearthing the charms and thus undoing their power . In that sense , Malinowski 's understanding of the psychosocial function of encounters such as Delwar 's was correct . Bangladeshis do turn to magical rites precisely in the face of events beyond their control , seeking some degree of at least psychological mastery over them. 18 <p> And if divination indeed produced " social facts , " putting closure on a question of causation without potentiating retaliation , it would seem to function as DuBois ( 1992 ) claims . But is DuBois correct in his claims that divination makes itself authoritative by distancing itself from personal or factional perspectives ? And what of Turner 's claim that divination " brings to light and so dispels the quarrels and grudges in the social group " ( 1975 : 245 ) ? These complementary claims only appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monologic declaration from beyond . The social facts produced by Delwar 's divinations are always candidate facts , moments in an ongoing and dialogical process . DuBois re-presents divination " texts " recorded by Evans-Pritchard , William Bascom , Paul Bohannan ( cited in DuBois 1992 ) , and others - certainly not linguistic anthropologists influenced by Bakhtin ( or by later analysts of that prototype of all dialogue , the everyday conversation ) . Not surprisingly , the only evidence of multivocality preserved in DuBois 's re-presented texts entails their embedding of the quoted speech of ancient diviners or deities . Does divination dispel grudges ? Only to the extent that clients receive divinatory indications as to who has cursed their loved one that are paradoxically clear enough and yet understandable enough to forgive . But , not only is that account atypical at least of the divinations I recorded ; it also presumes that clients accept the divination as authentic and do not come back in a few days complaining vigorously about inaccuracy or lack of improvement . If clients receive a diviner 's " text " as authoritative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - and Delwar never does - how does that " bring to light and so dispel quarrels " ? The potential social functions of either restoring the previously harmonious relationship of Liakot , whose story I mentioned earlier , with his friend , or perhaps exposing the wicked enmity of his friend and his hired-gun sorcerer , were noticeable by their absence from the story as told me by Liakot 's family . <p> The potential for conflict both between Delwar and his clients ( clashing over divinations or the ( non ) results of the protective amulets he gives ) and between his clients and their still anonymous enemies resorting to sorcerers , is constituted in part , rather than alleviated , by Delwar 's divinations . " Conflict management " is perhaps what such systems are about - but only if we define management as , in large part , production and reproduction . <p>
