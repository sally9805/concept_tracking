<p> The driving safety record of Teamsters Local 70 is front-and-center in the 19-day garbage driver lockout that has caused tempers to flare across the East Bay as stinking trash has piled up while replacement drivers miss or ignore entire neighborhoods . <p> Waste Management officials , who return Sunday to the contract bargaining table , say their 481 locked-out East Bay garbage haulers on the whole have the worst safety record of all the company 's 22,500 drivers . They want to rectify that by securing a new contract with stiffer penalties for safety violations . <p> Officials from Teamsters Local 70  --  the union representing the locked-out haulers  --  and the rank-and-file drivers themselves dispute these claims , saying Teamsters drivers are doing hard work in a geographically challenging area and that their safety record on the whole is good . <p> The company 's contract with Local 70 expired June 30 and Waste Management locked out its drivers July 2 in what company officials described as a pre-emptive move against a rumored Teamsters strike . <p> The company wants a new contract with the ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's OK , while the union wants to maintain the past agreement , saying it gives management the tools it needs to get rid of unsafe drivers . The expired agreement made dismissals subject to a grievance procedure , which the company wants to eliminate . <p> By Waste Management 's numbers , Teamsters Local 70 drivers over the past five years were responsible for 724 injuries and 1,760 accidents , including two that resulted in the deaths of two nonemployees . <p> James Devlin , Waste Management 's area vice president , said Teamsters Local 70 's hourly injury rate is 207 percent higher than the average injury rate among all the company 's drivers . <p> Devlin also said Teamsters Local 70 drivers account for 29 percent of the company 's repeat offenders  --  those with two or more accidents or injuries in the first six months of 2007 . Local 70 comprises 2.1 percent of company drivers . <p> " We 're talking about a very unsafe group here , " Devlin said . " Most of these safety rules they 're violating are the law  --  not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not backing up without the truck beeper on . Some of the drivers told us they cut the wire on the back-up beeper because it gave them a headache . " <p> One driver had 18 violations , including hitting two freeway overpasses , and the company could n't get rid of him because of union resistance , Devlin said . The current contract , Devlin says , leaves supervisors " managerially impotent . " " All we can do in most cases is chronically counsel someone , " he said . <p> " This is not just for Waste Management  --  it 's for the community . Two people have been killed , " Devlin said . <p> The company 's pursuit of stiffer penalties for safety violations has created ill will among some rank-and-file drivers . <p> " It 's a lie , " said Jose Rubio , a 29-year-old locked-out garbage truck driver who has worked for Waste Management for seven years and says he 's never had an accident . " A week before they locked us out , they threw a barbecue for us as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They gave out a bunch of safety awards . We all know we 're supposed to wear our seat belts and to slow down in school zones . It 's the law . " <p> Rubio said the company requires drivers to attend weekly safety training meetings . Some receive points for good driving that they can cash in for gifts , including electronics and jewelry . " I do n't know what they 're trying to do other than make us look bad . <p> " Of course , there are going to be occasional accidents , " Rubio said . " We 're driving big trucks . People cut you off . But most of us are very safe . " <p> Union officials say the company is slowly trying to dismantle the contract . They cite the company 's desire to institute a no-strike provision in the new contract that would prevent members from honoring picket lines outside of those that are sanctioned in Alameda County . <p> Rob Dias , chief steward for Local 70 , who has been at the table during contract negotiations , questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defines an accident ? " he said . " I do n't know what their data represents . " <p> Dias said the union does n't discount the tragic nature of fatal accidents . He noted that in the case of Erich Jenkins , a 39-year-old fitness executive from Tracy who was killed in 2002 after being rear-ended by a Waste Management driver in Castro Valley , the union sustained the driver 's termination . Devlin said the company had to fight tooth and nail to get rid of the driver , at the time a veteran of the company . <p> Dias said other areas of the country Waste Management serves do n't have as many hills , nor are they as congested as Oakland and other cities served by the company in the East Bay . Drivers are bound to have more accidents in an urban area than their counterparts in suburban and rural areas , Dias and rank-and-file drivers said . <p> " The position of the company is a take it or leave it attitude , " Dias said . " That 's what 's causing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the expired contract be maintained in its totality could be viewed as showing flexibility , Dias said the company in 2001 agreed to " no take-aways . " The union views the company 's request to have employees cover a portion of health care cost increases , the no-strike rule and the new safety penalties as take-aways . <p> " We had no alternative but to ask for a five-year extension , " Dias said . <p> Contract sought by management <p> Waste Management would pay health-insurance premium increases of up to 9 percent each year of the contract , with employees paying any increases above 9 percent . If premiums increase less than 9 percent in a year , savings would be banked and would be applied toward future increases in excess of 9 percent in subsequent years . <p> The company proposes no strike/no lockout during the contract . Provision would bar sympathy or wildcat strikes , sit-downs , slow-downs , work stoppages , boycotts and restrict honoring picket lines to those pickets initiated by the Local 70 or sanctioned by the Teamsters Joint Council No. 7 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , respectively , in any 12-month period for violation of safety rules . Drivers must abide by " life critical rules , " including never driving in reverse while a co-worker is on the riding step , wearing seat belts , and obeying posted speed limits . <p> Source : Waste Management of Alameda County Waste Management 's temporary workers , who declined to give their names , pick up trash in East Oakland on Friday . / Mike Kepka / The Chronicle
