Charcoal Still the Choice for Pros <p> Are you process- or result-oriented ? Adventuresome or safety-minded ? What 's important to you when you travel : the journey or the destination ? These are some pretty philosophical questions , but the answers will help you choose the right barbecue grill . I 'm referring , of course , to the great debate that has divided grill jockeys for decades : charcoal versus gas . <p> Grilling with Charcoal . Most professional grill jockeys prefer charcoal and with good reason . Charcoal generally burns hotter than gas , so you get a more truly grilled taste . Charcoal grills are more versatile than gas grills : It 's easier to toss wood chips or herbs on the coals and you get a better smoke flavor . Not to mention the fact that they give you something to do during the barbecue ( in other words , they require constant attention ) , which will make you feel like a real pit master , not a cook whose stove happens to be outdoors . Charcoal grills cost a lot less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both charcoal and wood . Visit a barbecue festival , like Memphis in May or the Kansas City Royal , and you wo n't find a gas grill around for miles . <p> So why does n't everyone grill on charcoal ? First of all , it 's messy . It 's also relatively unpredictable ( every fire burns differently ) and it 's harder to control the heat . A charcoal lire invariably has hot spots and cool spots and does n't burn the same way 30 minutes or an hour into the cooking process as it does when you first put the food on the grill . And if you are cooking for longer than an hour . the coals must be replenished . So charcoal grills require more supervision than gas grills . Of course , that 's what makes using them so much fun . <p> In the old days you doused the charcoal with lighter fluid and tossed on a match . Maybe it lit and maybe it did n't . To solve this problem , manufacturers created self-lighting charcoal , which has the lighter fluid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighting charcoal burns easily and evenly . But many people still do n't like the idea of grilling food over charcoal that 's been laced with petroleum products , Today . there are two cleaner , safer , more ecologically sound ways to light charcoal . <p> The electric starter : An electric starter is a looped heating element you place beneath a pile of charcoal . Plug the device in and the coals will be blazing in 15 minutes . The electric starter is clean and easy to work with , but it does n't , light the charcoal quite as evenly as does a chimney starter Another drawback is that you need a power outlet near your grill . I like to use an electric starter to light a deep or small grill , like a ceramic cooker or hibachi . <p> The chimney starter : The more popular method for lighting charcoal is to use a chimney starter , a large , upright , hollow metal cylinder with a wire partition in the center . The charcoal briquettes or lump charcoal go in the top and a crumpled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative to newspaper , you can use paraffin starters . You light the paper and in 15 to 25 minutes you have blazing coals . The beauty of a chimney starter is that its cylindrical shape helps ignite the coals evenly . Also , it allows you to light additional coals to replenish those in a smoker or grill used for indirect grilling in advance of when you 'll need them . <p> Once you master grilling over charcoal , you can pretty much cook on any type of grill , which is another reason to make your first one a charcoal grill . <p> Grilling with Gas . Most gas grills start with the push of a button . You control the heat with the twist of a knob , which makes cooking on a gas grill as predictable as cooking on the stove . ( In theory at least . Like charcoal grills , most gas grills have hot and cool spots , so you have to master their idiosyncrasies . Nonetheless , there 's virtually no special setup involved . ) You get to grill without charcoal dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you start with a full tank of gas , you should be able to grill for 12 to 18 hours straight without refueling . In the old days , gas grills had a hard time reaching the proper charring temperature , but the new gas grills burn as hot as blazing charcoal . <p> In the past , smoking was not something gas grills did well . Many grills did n't get quite hot enough to make the wood chips smolder . Even if they did , it was difficult to place the chips near the fire . Even worse , many grills had to be run at full bore to generate smoke , and that 's too hot for indirect grilling or smoking most food . <p> This problem has been resolved recently by the advent of a slide-out smoker box with a dedicated burner . The box is a long slender drawer you open and fill with wood chips . The dedicated burner makes smoking a snap , because you can run a high heat under the chips to make smoke  --  even while you 're maintaining the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low and slow smoking . From the consumer 's point of view , the best position for the smoker box is on one side of the grill , not in the center . When the smoker box is in the center , the heat it produces can interfere with indirect grilling . <p> Other Options . This brings us to smokers , rotisseries , and what I call the pseudogrills . <p> Smokers , logically , are used for smoking . While most ( but not all ) models are charcoal- or wood-fired , the food does not cook directly over the flames . In fact , in a traditional American smoker ( sometimes referred to as a horizontal barred smoker ) , the food cooks in a chamber separate from the fire . <p> For many people , especially those who live in Texas . Memphis , Kansas City , or North Carolina , grilling is a mere footnote to the glory of true barbecue . The real star of the show is the smoker . <p> Smoking is a uniquely American form of live-fire cooking  --  the only real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereby whole hogs , Boston butts , and beef shoulders and briskets are reduced into morsels of smoky perfection , cooked tender enough to pull apart and eat with your fingers . There are two basic types of backyard smokers : water smokers and barrel smokers . Both are easy to use and produce exquisite down-home barbecue every time . <p> The vertical water smoker looks like a giant upright bullet , with a firebox at the bottom , water pan in the center , and cooking chamber under the domed lid . The genius of this type of smoker lies in the water pan . Smoking tends to dry foods out , so by placing a pan of water ( or beer , wine , cider , or other flavorful liquid ) in the center of the smoker , you keep the food moist and succulent . <p> The traditional water smoker burns charcoal . But more and more people are using electric watersmokers , which maintain an even heat and output of smoke and do n't require hourly refueling . <p> The horizontal barrel smoker is modeled on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The smoker consists of a cylindrical or boxlike smoke chamber set off from the firebox . The smoke chamber can run horizontally or vertically . The offset firebox allows you to burn whole logs or charcoal while maintaining the requisite low temperature in the smoke chamber . Most home models burn charcoal ; you add soaked wood chunks to generate smoke . <p> Electric smokers are also available , and if you 're not embarrassed by the convenience of electricity ( and some purists are ) , electric smokers produce an excellent smoke flavor with a lot less fuss than their charcoal counterparts . <p> Speaking of electricity , electric grills are becoming more and more popular-especially with condo and apartment dwellers whose building associations often prohibit the use of gas or charcoal grills . A good electric grill will produce the same sort of high dry heat you get on a gas grill , and the hot grate leaves convincing grill marks . Purists would deny that these devices are grills at all , but I say they 're better than nothing . The same is true of grill pans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grill marks on burgers , steaks , and chicken breasts . <p> Electric grills are primarily used for direct ( not indirect ) grilling . They are best suited to cooking small or thin pieces of meat , seafood , or vegetables , such as steaks , pork and lamb chops , chicken breasts , fish fillets , fish steaks , shrimp , or sliced vegetables . <p> And then there are rotisseries . These offer a unique rotary grilling process in which the food turns slowly in front of or next to the fire . They can be fueled by charcoal , gas , or an electric burner . The gentle turning of the spit is particularly well suited to cylindrical roasts and poultry . The slow rotation promotes a natural external and internal basting . Foods come out dark and crusty on the outside and plump and moist inside , which makes the rotisserie a winner in my book . <p> Some of the world 's best live-fire-cooked food comes not off the grill but off a rotisserie . Since rotisserie-cooked chickens baste themselves as they turn , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fork into . Rotisserie cooking has another advantage : Because it 's a long , slow cooking method , there 's plenty of time to melt off fat . The melting fat keeps the food from drying out , while conveniently disappearing by the time you 're ready to eat . <p> So what foods should you cook on a rotisserie ? Chicken , duck , and game hens are the most obvious candidates . Cylindrical roasts , like rib roasts and leg of lamb ( both whole or butterflied and rolled ) do well , too . But do n't stop there . Pork ribs are delectable cooked on the rotisserie . <p> The classic French setup for rotisserie cooking is to have the heat source behind the turning food . Visit a poultry shop in Paris and you 'll find multiple spits of golden chickens turning in front of a wall of heat ( rows of gas jets provide the heat ) . This is the setup used by many gas grill manufacturers in the United States , from affordable grills like the Ducane to high-priced supergrills like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire up the burner , spit the food , and turn on the rotisserie motor . <p> To rotisserie grill on a gas grill with three front-to-back burners , light the rear burner and position the spit and food over the unlit center burner . <p> You can also do a sort of rotisserie grilling on a gas grill with three or four side-by-side burners . Light the outside burners and position the food over the unlit center burners . To the purist , this is n't really true rotisserie grilling because the food does n't face the flame . But you 'll still get tasty results , even if the exterior wo n't be quite as crisp and brown . <p> By Steven Raichlen <p> <p> Steven Raichlen is the author of the best selling The Barbecue !
