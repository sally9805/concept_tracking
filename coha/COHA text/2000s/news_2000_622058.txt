<p> On a recent visit to this Persian Gulf state , Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak just had to satisfy his curiosity . <p> It was past midnight when he entered unannounced into the tiny headquarters of the Al Jazeera television station . As he surveyed the surprised staff of 300 , he quickly turned to Safwat Sharif , the head of Egypt 's television broadcasting empire , and told him : " All this trouble from a matchbox like this . " <p> Nothing in recent times has thrilled Arab peoples and exasperated their leaders more than the uncensored news and freest commentary they have ever known , produced by this backwater cubicle in the desert . <p> " It 's not just what may be fact , " said Al Jazeera program editor Ahmad Sheikh . " It is the spectacle of debate in a region starved of it . " <p> Al Jazeera became a reality four years ago after Qatar 's Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani overthrew his father in a 1995 bloodless palace coup , an event that hardly electrified the world . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the tiniest Arab states . Its capital , Doha , is one of the world 's dullest cities . But the 43-year-old sheik quickly enlivened the nation by democratizing the political process . <p> He gave women the right to vote . He abolished the Ministry of Information , which in most Arab countries censors and controls the media . He introduced satellite television so Qatar residents could see programs and news from other nations . These changes eventually led to the creation of Al Jazeera . <p> " We have no army or tanks , only Al Jazeera , " said Abdul Aziz Tamimi , a young Qatari archivist . <p> DOMINO EFFECT <p> The success of Al Jazeera , which is modeled after CNN 's 24-hour news program , has spurred other Arab nations to create satellite Arab-language news programs  --  ranging from Saudia Arabia to Ajman , the tiniest of the United Arab Emirates ' seven city-states . <p> Although the new medium knows no frontiers , the content from most networks in the Arab world has varied little in decades . For the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Most Arab nations have swayed little from the Charter of Arab Honor , a 1965 Arab League ordinance designed at the time to curb an aggressive Lebanese press and discourage mutually hostile regimes from attacking each other . <p> Typically , most Arab newscasts are dominated by fawning accounts of the activities of presidents , monarchs or emirs . Although some have more flexibility to tackle serious political , social or economic issues , they hardly compare to the free press found in democratic societies . <p> Television networks in most Arab nations usually rely on a heavy dose of Egyptian soap operas , dubbed foreign movies , quiz and talk shows , song and dance programming . <p> Al Jazeera , on the other hand , offers little pap . Its programming is exclusively political ; no entertainment , no dumbing down . With this formula , it has buried all rivals . <p> No one has contributed more to this David 's triumph than the Persian Gulf 's big brother nation  --  Saudi Arabia . <p> In 1996 , the BBC 's Arabic Service insisted on showing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irritating members of the ruling family who had financed the network . They abruptly terminated their support , leaving 20 experienced Arab-language media professionals without a job . <p> The 20 went to work for the fledgling new station in Qatar . <p> CRAVING FOR GOOD JOURNALISM <p> Today , Al Jazeera has 32 foreign correspondents and is rapidly acquiring more . It has identified a market craving for serious and independent journalism . A recent poll shows that its closest competitor is Saudi Arabia 's MBC network followed by the London-based ANN , a station that is owned by Rifaat Assad , the estranged brother of the late Syrian President Hafez Assad . <p> English-speaking Arabs who formerly turned to CNN now have the Arabic equivalent , covering their affairs with an Arab touch no foreigner could match  --  and causing a run on satellite dishes in some nations . <p> " It is great to hear real journalism in our language , " said Abdullah Sherif , a Palestinian technician . <p> Most viewers tune in to Al Jazeera 's U.S.-style , call-in talk shows . Unlike other Arab-language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanism for screening out politically embarrassing questions . Not even questions about a regime 's fundamental legitimacy are off-limits . <p> The most popular talk show is " Opposite Direction , " modeled after CNN 's " Crossfire . " Its host , Faisal Qasim , a drama graduate from Britain 's Hull University , acts as a kind of referee between two analysts of opposing opinions . <p> " The dirt in our society has been swept under the carpet for too long , " said Qasim . " This wo n't be the case much longer . Someday , a free Arab press may help create real democracy in the Arab world . " <p> Even Islam , traditionally a sacred cow in Arab media , has not gone unscathed . In a now-famous debate over polygamy , Jordanian feminist Tujan Faisal so enraged Egyptian writer Safinaz Kazem , a Marxist-turned-Islamist , that the latter stormed out during the program . <p> So did former Algerian premier Reda Malek , who had been criticized by an Islamic fundamentalist . <p> And for the first time in his career , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an " apostate " for such views as attributing the 1967 military defeat to Israeli to social conservatism rooted in Islam , found a wide platform for his views . <p> Azm debated one of the Arab world 's most eminent conservative clerics , Yusif Qaradawi , at one point mocking him as the upholder of a " backward " religion . <p> RISE OF A TALK SHOW HOST <p> Show host Qasim , still unknown outside the Arab world , has become as well-known as many regional leaders . Qasim , a Syrian Druze , is mobbed wherever he goes , and some Arab cities are near deserted when his show is on the air . <p> But not everyone is an Al Jazeera fan . <p> The Syrian government has insinuated that Israel is helping fund the network . The Kuwaitis have called it a tool of Iraq . Algeria 's government once ordered a power blackout during a program about its political situation . <p> Both Jordan and Kuwait have shut down Al Jazeera 's news bureaus . Saudi Arabia wo n't even allow its reporters to cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has pressured local businessmen not to place ads with the maverick station . Interior Minister Prince Nayif , who once saluted Al Jazeera as " excellent and accurate , " now says it " serves up poison on a golden platter . " <p> Such pressure has frightened off advertisers , leaving Al Jazeera still in the red and dependent on a $150 million grant from the Qatar government . The network hopes to attract advertisers from the United States and Europe and sell documentaries and other programs to other networks . <p> NO CRITICISM FROM SADDAM <p> Ironically , one of the Arab world 's most reviled rulers , Iraqi President Saddam Hussein , is one of the few to refrain from criticism . Analysts reckon that he believes he has more to gain from Al Jazeera 's sympathetic reporting of his people 's plight from the U.N . economic embargo than from attacks against his repressive government . <p> Al Jazeera and Qasim have been the target of scores of hostile articles in the Arab press . A leading Cairo weekly , Akhbar al-Yaum , campaigned to have Qasim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a singer . A Jordanian columnist once wrote about Qasim : " This man 's tongue should be cut out . " <p> So far , Qatar 's government has stood firm against the onslaught of criticism . The sheik " does n't like being pushed around , " according to a prominent official . <p> Qatar 's foreign ministry refers all complaints to Al Jazeera itself . <p> " We tell them that if you think we have said something wrong , you have always the right to respond , " said Muhammad Jasim , the network 's managing director . <p> Chronicle Foreign Service
