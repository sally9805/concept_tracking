<p> As one of the world 's richest people , Meg Whitman could travel by corporate jet , a preferred perk of many business executives . Most of the time , though , she chooses to take commercial flights . It 's a way to meet her customers . <p> " If I 'm in an airport wearing an eBay hat or eBay T-shirt , people will come up to me and ask me if I work for eBay . When I tell them ' yes , ' they say : ' I want to tell you , my feedback rating is 936 . ' Before they tell me their name , before they tell me what they sell , it 's their feedback rating . It is a really important part of eBay 's chemistry , " she says , explaining that the customer-community approval process - through which eBay users rate one another 's reliability - is what makes her online-auction business tick . EBay , she says , is a company driven by self-worth . <p> America 's most pragmatic chief executive is happily at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child of privilege , she sits in her open cubicle in San Jose , Calif. , surrounded by family photos , Beanie Babies , Mr. Potato Head figures , and dozens of other mementos collected along a more than 20-year course through corporate America . One item stands out : a yellow hard hat with " Whitman " stenciled across the front . <p> The hat lends an anomalous bricks-and-mortar feel to the world 's most audacious Internet company , one whose nine-year trajectory has been far steeper than those of Microsoft , Dell , Amazon , or Wal-Mart . By charging a 35-cent listing fee and a small percentage for transactions , the company has grown sevenfold since she took the helm in 1998 . It facilitated the exchange of nearly $ 24 billion in goods and services last year , nearly doubling its 2002 revenues to $ 2.17 billion in 2003 . This year $ 3 billion is within reach . Its registered customers are expected to surpass 100 million worldwide . In a sign that her board credits Whitman , it more than doubled her salary this week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth has been compared with New York City 's rise from an 18th-century fur trading settlement to a commercial powerhouse connected to the western markets by the Erie Canal . By harnessing the Internet , eBay might be more precisely considered a commercial cyclotron , accelerating and expanding business even into tiny , obscure corners of the world . <p> More than 20 million items are listed on eBay at any given time . A car sells every minute . More than 175 million searches are conducted daily . Some 10 million bids every 24 hours result in about $ 900 worth of goods and services exchanged every second . <p> From her collection-filled cubicle , Ms. Whitman is at the epicenter of this cyclotron . She is also eBay 's one true bit of brick and mortar . Widely viewed as hard-nosed , she is also called humble - a characteristic that contrasts with the arrogance of some contemporary CEOs . This customer-service specialist seems uniquely qualified to run a firm at which the customers really are the company . <p> " EBay 's extraordinary rise and built-to-last staying power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , insight , galvanized experience , and skills , " says Howard Schultz , chief executive officer of Starbucks , the coffee giant he 's run since 1987 . He recently ended five years of service on eBay 's board of directors , a tenure Mr. Schultz calls " the highlight of my business career . " <p> " She represents both the emotional and rational side of the brand , " says venture capitalist Bob Kagle , who helped recruit Whitman for eBay . " She is an active and fair listener and tough-minded and competitive . " Says Mary Meeker , the Goldman Sachs Internet analyst on whose board of directors Whitman sits : " Meg personifies emotional intelligence , emotional IQ . She has worked with significant people in her life . She has been in on a significant number of decisions and situations . She 's processed a lot . It is the multitude of experiences that has shaped her and it can not be underestimated . " <p> Just a few years ago , before Whitman 's face appeared on the cover of every business magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no signature look save the efficient page-boy ; a round , open face hosting a generous smile ; and mirthful eyes that radiated a sense that she welcomes entertainment . You might have thought soccer mom/business exec - and been accurate . <p> Meg Whitman grew up the youngest of three children in an affluent family in Cold Spring Harbor , N.Y. , on the northern coast of Long Island . Her father made a polite living loaning money to businesses that put up their accounts receivables as collateral . Her mother was , she says , a " stay-at-home mom . " Both parents traced their lineage to Boston Brahmins . Whitman attended Cold Spring Harbor 's highly rated public high school . She played field hockey , tennis , and basketball . She swam competitively and earned superb grades . <p> But it was near the end of her senior year that something surprising and seminal occurred . Her mother joined a women 's delegation to China headed by actress Shirley MacLaine . It was one of the first such missions to visit after the nation reopened its doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home after this great adventure , she told me what this experience taught her . She realized she could do anything she wanted and she wanted me to recognize that I could do the same , " Whitman recalls . " It was a formative experience for both of us . " <p> Whitman attended Princeton , intending to become a physician . " But organic chemistry got in the way , " she recalls , smiling . She majored in economics , graduated in 1977 , and enrolled at Harvard Business School that autumn . Her classmates included Elaine Chao , now US secretary of Labor ; Gary Marshall , chairman and CEO of PepsiCo ; Ronald Sargent , CEO of Staples ; and John Thain , CEO of the New York Stock Exchange . <p> At Harvard she also met Griffith Harsh IV , who was finishing medical school . Three years later , after she earned her MBA and had worked on consumer branding at Procter &; Gamble ( with Steve Case , who would later run America Online ) Whitman and Mr. Harsh married . <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the University of California at San Francisco , Whitman joined the San Francisco office of Bain &; Company as a management consultant . She brought with her a P &G; brand sensitivity , but it was her time in the field that forged what became her greatest strength - the ability to listen to customers and process their needs and desires into action . <p> For the next decade , as she was raising two children , Whitman moved upward in marketing positions , always advocating for customers as the driving forces for success . As a senior vice president for marketing consumer products at Disney , she helped open theme stores overseas , where she experienced language , social , and business-culture barriers that would again have to be reckoned with as eBay expanded its reach . <p> She was also served well by her own flexibility . In 1992 , as she was hitting stride with Disney , her husband was offered a key post at the prestigious Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston . He went , and Whitman followed , becoming president of Stride Rite shoes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculated risk . She joined Florists Transworld Delivery ( FTD ) a more than 80-year-old under-the-radar cooperative of florists who were frustrated by their lack of market reach . But even as president and CEO , the process of forming a network among loose confederations of florists who jealously guarded their own turfs and business models was akin to dragging cats to the bathtub . <p> After just over a year , she left to join Hasbro 's preschool division , where she took charge of global marketing and management of the Mr. Potato Head brand and the Playskool brand that had been losing money fast . The task was n't just brand growth ; it meant a total turnaround . She was delighted by the challenge . So were her two sons , ages 13 and 10 . Their mom had the coolest job . She was in charge of toys . <p> Meanwhile , on the opposite coast , a little Internet auction enterprise that began in a San Jose townhouse had morphed into a runaway business for its founder , Pierre Omidyar . A computer programmer , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1995 just to test and develop his own programming skills . <p> Within two years , the firm , renamed eBay , had 300,000 users and 40 employees . It had sidestepped two efforts to purchase it , both by newspaper giants who visualized an avenue for online classified ads . And it had fended off competition and also acquired $ 5 million in venture funding . <p> Then Whitman 's and Omidyar 's paths crossed . EBay needed adult supervision . <p> " We went through the normal exercise , with 50 names on the list of potential candidates . And when we whittled it down to five , it was clear that Meg - mostly because of her brand and customer experience - stood head and shoulders above everybody else , " recalls Omidyar , now worth more than $ 10 billion , according to Forbes magazine . " I remember her listening to our explanations of the business and she said : ' It looks like the experience people have with each other helps define your brand . ' She was intuitive about us . She got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful economics , " adds Mr. Kagle , the venture capitalist . " And even more important , she ' got ' immediately the emotional and community side of the brand ... She also understood that Pierre had created something special and that his wisdom would continue to be a huge asset , " he says . " In my experience , most prospective or newly installed executives are interested in running their own show and creating their own history . Meg got Pierre just as she got the company . That , to me , displayed amazing maturity . " <p> After performing as much due diligence as possible , Whitman and her family moved west and she joined eBay . She brought in experienced managers , added to her board Starbucks 's Mr. Schultz and Scott Cook , an old colleague from Bain , and the eventual cofounder of Intuit . <p> Whitman then struck a strategic partnership with AOL , a move that fended off would-be rivals , including Microsoft , Yahoo , and Amazon . Within six months , she helped take the company public . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his president , reached into the billions , and Whitman 's net worth topped $ 1 billion . <p> A year later , in an incident that would become the reason Whitman includes a hard hat among her decorations , she and eBay hit their nadir . Shortly before 7 p.m. on Thursday , June 10 , 1999 , eBay 's site went down - and stayed down . Millions of eBayers around the globe saw their dealings suspended , including companies in that community for whom eBay handles the bulk of their distribution . The site had crashed before , but each time , the engineering team had been able to resuscitate it . But this had all the signs of a meltdown . <p> Whitman had been monitoring the situation from home before driving to eBay 's headquarters at 4 a.m . " I did the only thing I knew how to do - be there . " Being there , among the bewildered engineers and IT vendors would prove to be a defining moment in her career . Cots were set up in the conference room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaving cream , shampoos , and conditioner . The war room atmosphere at eBay had the look of a long night that nobody knew how to end . <p> " If I was there , then the best people from the vendors would be there , " Whitman says . " I could call Scott McNealy at Sun , which ran our servers , or Ray Lane at Oracle , or Mark Leslie at Veritas and say : ' I really need you . ' " Whitman also saw this as the right moment to leap out of her comfort zone . " I 'd go to meetings and hear about technology-platform architectures , things I did n't understand . Obviously , it was time I learned . " <p> She does n't shy away from holding others to that same level of accountability . " She 's the most down-to-earth executive I 've ever worked for , " says an executive who interacts with Whitman almost daily . " But when she asks , you 'd better have your answers , your numbers , and your recommendations ready . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the weekend . When the site would allow , the eBayers at headquarters could log in and hear from the community of customers , people who might be just one click away from defecting . But the preponderance of feedback was not a howl of indignation , but sympathy and offers of help . Ebay 's center , its community , had held . But for how long ? <p> " On Monday , the site came up but was not working , " Whitman recalls . " Pierre arrived and came into the operations room . One look at us and he could tell what we 'd been through nonstop over the weekend . I went up to him and said : ' What if they ca n't fix this ? ' " Whitman recalls . " Pierre , who is the calmest individual in the world , said : ' Usually , when it gets this bad , they 're just a couple of hours from figuring it out . ' " <p> Whitman was not completely reassured . But she held out hope . " Sure enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came running in and said : ' I 've got it ! I 've got it ! ' " Whitman says , still sounding emotional nearly five years later . " We 've come a long way from 1999 , " she adds quickly . " Technology was our Achilles ' heel , and now it is our core competence . " <p> But the transition was n't as smooth as she makes it sound . In the four months following the site blowup , heads rolled at eBay . New technology protocols were put in place . " I learned more about technology than I could have learned in 10 years , " Whitman says . " It was total immersion . " Her handling of the crisis also honed some of Whitman 's own core competencies . <p> " She quickly found issues with the leadership of the technology team , " Omidyar says . " This likely would have evolved into what our engineering team looks like today , it 's just too bad it had to come to a head so quickly . " <p> Whitman can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Meg lives to make crisp , fast-moving decisions , " says Mr. Cook . " But she also listens , she explores , and obsesses about the community . And it is this community that makes the eBay you see . For instance , they recently opened an empty store on the site an experimental , designated area online that could be " stocked " with a selection of goods . The community filled it . They decided what is for sale . " <p> The community also pushed the firm to buy PayPal for $ 1.5 billion in 2002 , a move that has given eBay an infrastructural barrier against competition , from say , a resurgent Yahoo , Microsoft , and search-engine powerhouse Google , which has been testing Froogle , its own e-commerce platform . A recent downplaying of Froogle has prompted speculation that Google - said to be on the brink of going public - is not ready to do battle with eBay . <p> But Whitman is taking nothing for granted . She arises at 6 a.m. every workday , works out for 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband and two sons , whom she usually drives to school . She 's usually in the office by 8:30 a.m. checking in with her executive staff in cubicles surrounding her own . She then reads e-mail from eBay 's sellers and buyers and monitors the support groups . <p> " You have to have a sense of what issues are hot in the community , " she says firmly . " A cardinal sin is not knowing what the community 's concerns are . Even worse , initiating something here without consulting the community . " She cites the decision to ban gun sales ( something the business would have done regardless of the community reaction ) and something seemingly trivial , such as introducing a star system without consulting the community - a move that caused an uproar . <p> " The beauty of this business ... is that when you ask 10 questions , you get 4,000 answers , " she says . " So we do a lot of synthesizing . We are also trying to stay focused and continue to solidify our brand . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as the competitive landscape is concerned , any online or offline place where you choose to spend money other than eBay is a competitor . " <p> Ebay 's size and efficiency , of course , make it a target for scrutiny . Its aggressive policing of companies it views as misusing information from its auctions , along with its perceived toughness in setting the prices " third-party " firms pay to interact with it , have led critics to charge that it verges toward monopoly control of the auction realm . <p> Supporters counter that the marketplace will provide its own checks on eBay 's expansion . Language barriers , currency issues , even customs will present problems for eBay 's globalization . Security is still an issue ( a California man recently pleaded guilty to money laundering for using fake identities to inflate bidding on $ 450,000 worth of fake paintings he listed on the site ) . Whitman understands these problems and knows they are solvable . Remarkably , humility seems to accompany that knowledge . <p> " We 're a different company every three months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top to bottom , do we have the right people in the right place at the right time ... ? I even ask myself if I 'm the right person for the right time . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 . The Christian Science Monitor
