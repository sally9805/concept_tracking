" DE TALKIN ' GAME " // The Twenties ( and Before ) // First and foremost a storyteller , with profound appreciation for the power of a well-crafted tale , Hurston moved to New York in 1925 and used her storytelling talent to refashion her life along mythic lines , erasing everything that did n't contribute to the new person she had determined to create . That person would have known hardships and hard times , but mostly in a general way . She might have disappointments , but they would never become obstacles . She would be tough and independent and young ( in her early twenties , like her friends ) . Above all , she would be game for everything , full of enthusiasm and ideas . Nothing would be beyond her . She would live up to her proud heritage as a daughter of Eatonville , America 's first incorporated all-black town-even if that meant starting over from scratch . // Accordingly , the only full-scale biography of Zora Neale Hurston starts by describing how " in the first week of January , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hurston begins her life over again in the twenties , establishing herself as a writer , social scientist , and active member of the nation 's first major upsurge of African American arts . // During this period , she developed her own aesthetic : an embroidered realism equally committed to liveliness and accuracy . Her developing style as a writer mirrored her personality : hardheaded and sentimental , constrained and effusive , objective and fanciful , all at the same time . The Harlem Renaissance-for all its own self-conscious mythmaking-afforded Hurston the necessary ground on which to build this new life . It gave her a collective enterprise in which she could play a valued role . Among its many circles she could find the publishers , editors , writers , artists , scientists , intellectuals , producers , directors , and patrons she needed to develop all the venues in which she sought to bring the African American vernacular to the American public . This period opened the door to a number of intimate friendships , an inner circle of confidants among whom Hurston hoped to find soulmates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gender , and upbringing . Characteristically , Hurston seemed unfazed by the dazzle of New York 's Roaring Twenties . Whereas Harlem was a revelation for many African Americans who had never before been in such a teeming community of black people , Hurston had been raised in an all-black town and was well accustomed to urban life by 1925 . She knew that this brief flourishing of America 's interest in black culture was a golden moment-perhaps she even sensed how very fleeting that fascination would be-and she wasted no time in using it to advance her personal and artistic goals . // Fashioning a serious career in this period meant becoming a good correspondent , keeping in touch with colleagues , friends , agents , editors , and publishers . Frequently , Hurston wrote multiple letters on a given day . Occasionally , she wrote more than one letter in a day to the same person . As far as can be determined , only one letter survives from earlier than the mid-twenties , although it is almost certain that she wrote to family and friends when she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a record , however , much of her early life remains a mystery . This may be how she wanted it . // What Hurston has written of her early years is peculiar . In her autobiography , Dust Tracks on a Road , she offers a story of her origins that reads like pure fiction . She even marks it as " hear-say , " a tall tale in the American tradition she called " lying . " // As she tells it , her mother found herself without benefit of midwife , friend , or the strength to " even reach down to where I was . " If an elderly white gentleman had not chanced on her birthing , she would surely have died . Like a " fairy godmother , " he counsels Hurston on her future . Included in his advice is an admonition not to " be a nigger " because " Niggers lie and lie . " Hurston 's only comment on this strange advice is to insist that he was color-blind and harmless . Why did Hurston choose to repeat-or invent-that story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter of two worlds , black and white ? Was she suggesting that white patronage-for good or ill-had always been a feature of her life ? Did she want her life to read like a racial fairy tale ? Or to make a parody of American fairy tales of race ? // Wherever we look for information on Hurston 's early life , we find interesting fictions she has left behind . The birth dates she gave for herself throughout her life-1898 , 1899 , 1900 , 1901 , 1902 , 1903 , and 1910-are all inaccurate , as scholars have recently discovered . Hurston was born on January 15 , 1891 , making her between seven and nineteen years older than she claimed . Neither was she actually born in Eatonville , as she claimed . // Like her parents , Hurston was born in Notasulga , Alabama , a place she describes as " an outlying district of landless Negroes , and whites not too much better off . It was ' over the creek , ' which was just like saying on the wrong side of the railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hurston speculates that " the ordeal of share-cropping on a southern Alabama cotton plantation was crushing to her father 's ambition . " // If Alabama was a desolate place , with conditions one longtime resident described as " outrageous in every way that you can think , " Eatonville , Florida , when the Hurstons arrived in 1892 , represented opportunity . The Hurstons prospered there . Hurston 's father , John , became a Baptist minister and pastor of the Macedonia Baptist Church , then served as Eatonville 's mayor from 1912 to 1916 . John Hurston was known as " a vocal and knowledgeable politician ... instrumental in the development of some of Eatonville 's first municipal laws . " // Eatonville was a fascinating small town founded in 1887 ( Hurston gives the date as 1886 ) , distinguished by being the nation 's first incorporated black town-and perhaps the nation 's oldest continually all-black town as well . Hurston 's Eatonville is more distinguished yet : a utopian , imagined world where blacks lived near whites " without a single instance of enmity , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindnesses , anger , hate , love , and envy , " " you got what your strengths would bring you , " and where the Hurston family enjoyed a nice " piece of ground with two big Chinaberry trees shading the front gate , " many bushes and flowers , " plenty of orange , grapefruit , tangerine , guavas and other fruits in our yard , " and an eight-room house . In Hurston 's Eatonville , " we had all that we wanted . " // Jonah 's Gourd Vine , Hurston 's first novel , is largely autobiographical and one of two novels ( the other never published ) that Hurston set in Eatonville . It provides as much ( maybe more ) information about Hurston 's early life as anything else she wrote , including her own autobiography . John " Buddy " Pearson , modeled on Hurston 's father , John , is a larger-than-life character . He can carry his little brother " under his arm like a shock of corn . " He is a " fine stud " and " splendid specimen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " a living exultation . " John 's sexual energy leads to " meandering " that proves fatal . Like this character , Hurston 's father was so powerful that his children called him " Big Nigger . " Like John Pearson , he was without " steering gear , " a man whose " share " of weaknesses derailed his life and sabotaged his daughter 's . He and Hurston were estranged for years . When he died on August 10 , 1918 , in Memphis , Hurston was living in Baltimore and , according to her autobiography , had already left him behind . It was her mother , not her larger-than-life father , who had always encouraged her to " jump at de sun . " // Little is said about this supportive and encouraging mother , just as Hurston would have little to say in print about any of her marriages . Jonah 's Gourd Vine and Dust Tracks on a Road both describe the scene of her mother 's death , on September 19 , 1904 , when Hurston was thirteen ( not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in Dust Tracks ) in almost identical terms . With her arms pinned behind her , Hurston watched her neighbors perform their local rituals of death : clock and looking glass shrouded in cloth , pillow taken from under the deceased 's head , deathbed turned to the east ( to disable the corpse 's reflection , hasten dying , and protect the household ) , all countermanded by her mother 's own dying instructions to avoid all superstition . Hurston referred often to the " years of agony " she suffered over failing to carry out her mother 's deathbed directions . My mother " depended on me for a voice , " she wrote , but she had let the townswomen triumph . // Of the years immediately following her mother 's death , little is known , except that they were difficult . Hurston 's teen years , from 1905 to 1912 , consequently , are often known as " the missing decade " or the " lost years , " years Hurston hid by changing her age and by revealing nothing from that time period . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tracks , a notoriously unreliable , guardedly written , heavily censored book . That story , also fictionalized , goes like this : Hurston 's father remarried shortly after her mother 's death , and Hurston 's new stepmother was intolerable . Rather than accept being an outsider in her own home , Hurston left : living in a boarding school , with two of her brothers in Jacksonville , with friends of the family , with families for whom she worked as a domestic , with her brother Dick in Sanford , Florida , and with her brother Bob in Memphis . Finally , she moved to Baltimore , Maryland , where her sister Sarah lived and where , after working as a waitress , she enrolled at Morgan Academy to complete her high school education . Between Memphis and Baltimore , Hurston traveled with a Gilbert &amp; Sullivan theater troupe as a maid . // Looking for these " lost " years encoded in Hurston 's writing has occupied much of the scholarship on Hurston . This research is suggested by African American women 's arts which hint at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folk art , preaching and other forms of religious expression . This coded language , Alice Walker writes , is how " our mothers and grandmothers have , more often than not ... handed on the creative spark . . . like a sealed letter they could not plainly read . " In the case of Hurston 's lost years , however , we must ask whether her novels truly address a special reader who knows how to read between her lines or whether Hurston choses-I believe is the case-to keep certain information from the public and to heavily edit her own life story . // In the twenties , Hurston did embrace publicity . At school , her writing quickly caught the attention of her teachers , Dwight O. W. Holmes , William Pickens , Lorenzo Dow Turner , Montgomery Gregory , and finally , Alain Locke at Howard , where Hurston joined the literary society and began to publish in its magazine , Stylus . The rich African American literary community of Washington , D.C. , welcomed Hurston . She fell in with Bruce Nugent , Jean Toomer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grimk ? , May Miller , and Georgia Douglas Johnson , who became a good friend . Being accepted at Howard- " to the Negro what Harvard is to the whites " - was " ecstasy , " Hurston wrote . // Nonetheless , Hurston felt like an outsider . A short story from this period , " John Redding Goes to Sea , " reveals some of the anxieties of these years . This story 's main character is immediately set off from his community and their narrow-minded view that he was " a queer child . " What John Redding wants is a bigger sphere , " the wide world-at last . " His devotion to his family and town , however , pulls him back , and he ultimately drowns in the very river on which he had hoped to escape . This is not one of Hurston 's best stories , but it suggests her ambivalence about the costs of leaving home . How could Hurston not have worried ? She had arrived at Morgan Academy with one dress and no change of underwear . Her classmates had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I had heard all about the swank fraternities and sororities and the clothes and everything , and I knew I could never make it . " // Hurston did , of course , " make it . " Her arrival in New York City in 1925 may have been a " long step for the waif of Eatonville , " but it was also a celebrated event . And she could take pride in having written her way up from Florida . The story " Drenched in Light " appeared in Opportunity in 1924 and brought her Charles S. Johnson 's attention . Johnson , the magazine 's founder , was one of the " midwives " of the Harlem Renaissance , " the root " of the entire movement , Hurston called him . Johnson encouraged Hurston to enter Opportunity 's first literary contest in 1925 and to come to New York to join the " New Negro " Renaissance . She won second place ( first place went to Langston Hughes ) for the short stories " Black Death " and " Spunk " and the play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Harlem literati Hurston could ever need . At the awards dinner , Hurston met Langston Hughes , Countee Cullen , Carl Van Vechten , Annie Nathan Meyer , and Fannie Hurst . // Continue ... //
