August 1774 , Charleston , SC <p> " You look lovely , Madelaine . Now , you mus n't be nervous . Geoffrey is a fine gentleman . " <p> Madelaine Hartwell looked up at her father , wondering at his odd comment . His hand shook as he reached up to knock on the door of the impressive Bay Street town house . He lowered his hand and sighed heavily . " I need a moment . " <p> Madelaine stood patiently by his side , having gotten used to his tremors since his drinking had overtaken his last bit of control . <p> She smoothed her palms over her dress and swallowed hard , his anxiety contagious . " I am a little nervous . After all , we have n't attended a social event since Mother died . " <p> " I know . I just have n't been myself since my Sarah passed . I thought I 'd fixed that damn wheel . I thought the carriage was safe .... " he trailed off , sniffing gruffly . <p> " The accident was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her bodice . <p> It was true he had n't been the same . Neither of them had , but it seemed that for Madelaine , the last seven years had been all about taking care of her crumbling father and trying desperately to keep food on the table as his gambling debts grew well beyond his ability to pay . She had watched in emotional agony as piece by piece their old life had been taken from them . First , her mother 's jewelry , then the silver and china , soon followed by every bit of furniture and finally the lovely home where she 'd grown up . <p> Last month they had been forced to move into a two-room unit above a dressmaker 's shop . Madelaine had been forced to sell every lovely gown in her mother 's wardrobe to keep them going and was now down to one . Though much too casual and a bit out of style , the gown was clean and presentable . The light shade of sky blue had been her mother 's favorite and Madelaine had put the dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was twenty-two , the dress fit , though a little snug in the bust . Madelaine had meant to let the seams out , but this evening 's invitation had come up so suddenly , she had n't had time to make the alterations . <p> " Tell me again how we came about being invited to this dinner , Father ? " she asked , fidgeting with the tight material . <p> " Geoffrey is a business acquaintance , " he replied evasively . He stiffened his shoulders and rapped the knocker three times before dropping his hand by his side . <p> Madelaine 's heart leapt at the loud crack of brass on brass . What is wrong with you tonight ? she chastised herself . She had never been the type to be skittish , but she could n't shake the strange feeling of foreboding that sent a shiver up her neck as the door slowly opened . She was n't used to her father acting so ... fatherly , and it was a bit unnerving . <p> They were taken to a large parlor , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father . As their host approached them , Madelaine began to feel more uneasy . His cold brown eyes roamed over her with much too much familiarity . Then when her father nudged her forward , she had the sudden feeling of being a rabbit stalked by a hungry fox . <p> " Geoffrey Townsend , this is my lovely daughter , Madelaine . " <p> " Yes , she certainly is , " Geoffrey responded , eyeing her up and down . <p> Madelaine felt increasingly self-conscious in the tight dress and when Geoffrey lifted her hand and brushed his tight lips across her knuckles , she had to fight not to pull away . <p> " I 'm pleased to meet you , Mr. Townsend . Thank you for having us here tonight . " <p> " I hope to have you many times in the future , " he whispered for her ears alone . <p> Madelaine jerked her hand away and backed up a step , glancing around to see if anyone had heard . There was no reaction from anyone , except a voluptuous brunette who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Introductions were made , drinks were served and Madelaine tried to relax as she chatted with a lovely older couple . Thank goodness her social skills were n't as dusty as she 'd feared . But as the evening progressed and despite Madelaine 's best efforts , the brunette named Felicia ignored her , returning often to Geoffrey 's side . Madelaine would have thought they were a couple , though Geoffrey seemed irritated at her attentiveness and brushed her arm off his sleeve more than once . <p> A portly butler entered the room , announcing that dinner would be served soon . Madelaine glanced at her father , who seemed terribly ill at ease . Geoffrey approached him , said a few words , and she watched as her father 's face paled considerably . Thinking he might be ill , she set her glass of sherry down and went to him . <p> " Father , are you well ? " she asked , touching his hand . <p> " I 'm fine , " he responded , without looking at her . " Geoffrey requests a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at their host . <p> " It will only take a moment , " Geoffrey said , his tone insistent . <p> Geoffrey offered his arm and Madelaine took it , feeling once again like the hunted rabbit . It was rude of her to assume there was something uncouth about Geoffrey , and she hated the fact that she could be judgmental at times . She attributed that unflattering characteristic to the difficult lessons she 'd learned at a much too young age . Countless times , she 'd had to roam the city 's unsavory side in search of her father , only to have to drag him away from one card game or another . <p> Once inside the study , Geoffrey went to his desk and sat down . He pulled papers from the top drawer and motioned her father forward . Avoiding her gaze , her father put his signature on the bottom of each of three pages . Geoffrey then handed him a small leather pouch , which he accepted in a trembling hand . When he finally turned to look at her , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomach did a sickening flip . She moved toward him but he put up a hand , stopping her . <p> " What is it , Father ? " Her voice was barely above a whisper . <p> " I have to tell you good-bye , Madelaine . " <p> " What ? What do you mean ? Are we leaving now ? " <p> " Forgive me , " her father repeated as he rushed out . <p> " Father ! " Madelaine began to follow him but Geoffrey reacted quickly , coming around to stop her . <p> " Wait , Madelaine . There 's more . Allow me to finish what your father started to tell you . " <p> " No , thank you . I 'll let my father tell me on our way home . Excuse me , " she said , stepping aside . <p> Geoffrey grabbed her arm in a bruising crush , pulling her back to stand in front of him . " You are home . And you should be grateful , you little guttersnipe . But you 'll learn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " <p> " I dare , because I can . Your father just gave you to me to do with as I please . " <p> " What ? " she asked , incredulous . <p> " Not gave ' really , since I paid him quite a sum for you . " <p> " Paid ? Is that what this was all about-the envelope , the papers ? Oh , God , what did he sign ? " she asked , feeling her heart drop to her feet . <p> " Simply put , he signed you over . He had amassed a sizeable debt to me , you see . But I forgave that debt , even gave him a small amount of money in return for you . You should be quite flattered . I 've never paid for a woman in my life . " <p> " Well , you 've made a terrible mistake thinking you have bought one now . I assure you , sir , you have not . " <p> Geoffrey advanced on her until she felt the backs of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down with force , though his tone remained calm . " Your opinion is of no consequence . What 's done is done-and quite beyond your control . I suggest you become a little more amiable and soon , before I lose my patience with you . " <p> " I want to talk to my father . " <p> Geoffrey leaned down over her , bracing his hands on the arms of the chair , trapping her . His low voice was filled with menace when he spoke , his eyes filled with undisguised lust . <p> " Your father just gave you to a relative stranger for money to stay good and drunk for all of six months . I would think you would be grateful that I have intervened in your pitiful situation . " <p> " If you have been of assistance to my father , then I am grateful , Mr. Townsend . But your business is with him , not me . " <p> " I know you have n't been in circulation for some time now , my dear , but surely you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in this city and you are fortunate to become my mistress . Without the deal I made on your behalf , you would likely end up a whore to a much lesser man . " <p> " I refuse to believe that my father would make such a deal with you . I am all he has left in the world . Do you really expect me to believe he would sacrifice me this way because you offered him money ? You disgust me for even suggesting such a thing . " <p> Geoffrey laughed contemptuously . He lowered his head close to her and spoke , his sour breath fanning her face with the putrid truth . " I am not the one who approached your father . He came to me . " When she shook her head in denial , he said , " Oh yes . It was only after I saw you last week leaving the dressmaker 's shop that I agreed . " <p> He ran a finger along her jaw and her skin crawled . She turned her face away and he jerked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will find pleasure in my bed or pain . The choice is up to you . I enjoy both immensely . " <p> He pulled her up from the chair by her elbows , her knees ready to buckle at any moment . Nausea flooded her . <p> Her father had gone to him ? It was n't possible . As low as her father had sunk to get alcohol and gambling money , she just could n't accept that he would ... sell her . How could he ? <p> Madelaine felt desperate with pain . Her heart had shattered in the last few years . She had come to believe that there was nothing left of it . But now ... she swore she could feel her heart breaking inside her chest . <p> She barely noticed as Geoffrey leaned down and placed his thin , hard lips against hers . But when his tongue forced entry into her mouth and his hand squeezed her breast cruelly , her instincts came alive . She shoved him away and wiped her lips with the back of her hand as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untried . It 's a pity the innocence does n't last for long . I really like it when they protest . No , all too soon you 'll be begging for my touch . " <p> " Never ! " she hissed , backing farther away . <p> A knock at the door caught Geoffrey 's attention and he opened it to the butler , who announced that the guests were waiting in the dining room . Madelaine had forgotten anyone else was in the house . Oh , God , what was she to do ? <p> " Come , my lovely . I 'll have to instruct you later , but for now , this is all you need to know . Tomorrow , Felicia and I are to be wed . She believes you are her new maid . Your days will be spent seeing to Felicia 's needs and whims and your nights will be spent in my bed , though I see no reason to upset her with the truth . I will assure you discretion for as long as you please me . Anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a promise . Now , shall we go in to dinner ? I am famished . " <p> He held out his arm as if nothing unusual had just occurred . <p> Madelaine stared at him in disbelief . " You do n't expect me to go back in there ? " she asked , incredulous . <p> " Yes , I do . I have guests out there waiting for me . Unfortunately , your drunk father could n't wait one more night to conclude our business , so I had to invite you tonight . Now I ca n't very well tell everyone who you are , and I refuse to try to explain your absence from the table along with your father 's abrupt exit from my home . So come along . " <p> She could n't speak ; her brain refused to process all that he was telling her . Too numb to resist , she let him lead her out of the room , down the hall and into the large dining room . He seated her next to the elderly couple she had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their words blending with the ringing in her ears . Across the table , Felicia 's eyes shone with disgust and jealousy . She knew exactly why Madelaine had been brought here and it was plain as day she was n't going to stand for another woman in her home . Madelaine shivered at the deadly promise coming from her cool , blue eyes . At the head of the table , Geoffrey watched her as intimately as if they were already lovers . <p> She felt trapped . And utterly alone . <p> As the dinner wore on endlessly , the sense of survival that had gotten her through her worst months , days and hours began to awaken . She had n't called on it for some time , and she suddenly realized she 'd been existing in a semiconscious state . If she had n't been , she would have seen this coming . God , she could have prevented this entire nightmare . <p> In that moment , she knew there was only one way she would survive this ordeal-alone . By her own wits . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would she allow her fate to be in the hands of a man . Every woman she had ever known lived under the control of the men in their lives . <p> And love ? What about love ? Madelaine 's innocent visions of that fairy tale had been destroyed more than once . She would n't be fooled again . <p> No , there was only one person she could rely on for all the things she needed in this world . Only one person she could trust with the freedom of thought and choice she desired more than anything else . <p> That person was her-and she vowed from now on she would never answer to another man as long as she lived . <p> Chapter Two Madelaine jerked awake as the clock in the foyer struck three . She had heard the chimes ring every hour since she 'd been shown to her room at eleven o'clock . Refusing to go near the bed , she chose to spend the hours in a brocade wingback chair by the fireplace . An unseasonable chill filled the room , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to the chair and tucked her feet up under her dress . <p> She had been dreaming about the twins . She often dreamt of her brother and sister when she was troubled . It was as if Robert and Katherine knew she needed them to give her comfort . Madelaine could n't help but think about what her family would have been like if the twins had n't died . Mother would n't have taken to running the roads in that damn carriage , always trying to hide from her sorrow . And Father would n't have started to drink and gamble until he lost everything , including his soul . Right now she 'd be at home with all of them , snug in her comfortable bed , dreaming of a happy future . <p> Instead , she was fighting sleep , trying desperately to think of a way out of this disaster her father had brought on her . So far , the night had brought her no answers . Leaving Geoffrey 's home was imperative , but once she did , that 's when her true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? She could n't go back to her father . Even if she believed he 'd had second thoughts and might help her , she would n't go back . Never . As much as it hurt to admit , he was lost to her now . He had sunk to selling the last of his family-his child-so he could continue to drink and gamble . <p> She could try to find work , but where ? She would have to leave Charleston , but without a recommendation and with only the small amount of money sewn into her petticoat , she would have to find something right away . With all of the Intolerable Acts , it would be difficult at best . People were n't spending money on luxuries like music and dance lessons . Their thoughts and finances were going to various war efforts-building a navy and strengthening the army were uppermost in many people 's minds . <p> Aunt Elsie and her cousins in London seemed to be her only option , but getting to England was going to be a tricky proposition . Blockades were increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel dangerous . Few passengers were still able or willing to find their way across the ocean . People were having to declare their allegiance and then scramble to get to whichever side of the Atlantic their loyalties demanded . But at this point , Madelaine 's situation could n't get much worse . If she died trying to get away , then at least she would n't have surrendered to becoming the mistress of a man like Geoffrey Townsend . <p> Aunt Elsie might not be thrilled to see her , though . An old feud that Madelaine had little knowledge about had kept the families apart since Madelaine was an infant . She was n't even certain of her aunt 's address . <p> A sound at the door startled Madelaine and she sat upright , listening intently . The hairs on the back of her neck bristled as she heard a key turn and the lock give way . The door cracked open and there was Geoffrey 's form in the firelight . His profile was directed toward the bed . Madelaine felt her skin crawl . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do you find some fault with the bed ? " he asked , looking with meaning at the covers , folded neatly back . " In other words , " he said , his ire rising , " why are n't you in it ? " <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
