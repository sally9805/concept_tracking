Section : Money &; Business Prime Time Retirees head back to college , and what 's not to like ? They often do n't need to study for exams-or even pay tuition <p> Al Green worked for nearly 40 years before he was able to retire . But a life of leisure was n't quite what he thought it would be . " I got bored playing golf , " says Green , 80 , of his 20 years of retirement in Florida . " And my wife did n't like the summers . " As Green started to ponder a new retirement plan , many of his fondest memories centered on Pennsylvania State University , from which he graduated in 1947 . So , Green and his wife moved back to State College , to take classes at Penn State . <p> College , of course , has changed since Green left campus . " There were 7,000 kids on campus when I was there , " he recalls . Today , there are more than 40,000 . That 's just one of the changes . Jeoffrey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retirement community in Ann Arbor , Mich. , says : " People have very fond memories of their time in college , and when they come back 40 or 50 years later it 's different . Not only is the college different and the town different , but life is different . " <p> Auditors . And there 's no place where these differences are more apparent than in the classroom . Some 47,000 people over age 65 were enrolled in college in October 2004 , the latest year for which the Census Bureau has data . But this number does n't include people like Green who live in retirement communities affiliated with a campus and who audit classes , a statistic that is not tracked nationally . Some universities , like Princeton , report that the number of auditors has doubled since 2001 while others , like Penn State , say the stream of auditors has remained steady . <p> As retirees attend college classes , an intergenerational dynamic is unfolding . A typical undergraduate student might celebrate when a professor needs to cancel a class , while a senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students have a slightly different agenda than the average undergraduate who may be taking this course because it 's a requirement , " says Theresa Lafer , an instructor at Penn State who has taught several classes that include both retirees and traditional students . It 's also very rare for an older student to miss even an early-morning class . Of course , since seniors often audit classes , they do n't have the pressures of grades , exams , and papers . <p> Senior students may at first cluster together in classes . " When you have a class that 's divided , with many adults versus as many traditional-age students , sometimes they separate into age cohorts , " Lafer says . " But once they start talking to each other , it is quite clear that they learn from each other 's experiences . " <p> Green enjoys interacting with the undergraduate students as much as he likes the classes themselves . " You do n't realize until you sit there how many changes you have seen that these kids have n't seen , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is your age , it 's kind of refreshing to realize there are people out there who still have their life ahead of them . " <p> Voice of experience . The most popular classes among senior citizens are history , literature , and philosophy . " None of the things I 'm studying right now are things I had courses in of any consequence in any of my earlier education , " says Lance Friedsam , 67 , a retiree auditing classes in art history and philosophy at Georgetown University in Washington , D.C. But Friedsam has visited art museums all over the world with his wife , who is an art historian , something few traditional undergraduates can boast . Especially in history courses , professors will sometimes draw on retirees ' knowledge for classroom discussion . " The teacher refers to them a lot more than usual , " says Nadine Rudolph , 19 , a sophomore marketing major at Penn State who has taken several courses with retired classmates . " They 'll talk about something from the ' 60s and look at the other adults . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also comes a propensity for retirees to share a little too much . Jost Lottes , director of the Senior Adult Learning Center at Portland State University , where any Oregon resident over age 65 can take classes free , says the school is careful not to enroll too many retirees in undergraduate classes . While about 500 senior citizens take classes each semester at Portland State , no more than five attend any one class . " We tell our seniors not to try to dominate the class and not to try to talk all the time , " Lottes says . <p> Princeton University caps enrollment in its community auditor program at 10 percent of the total number of students in each class . " We have to make sure community auditors do not ask questions or seek to engage the professor during class , " says Princeton spokesperson Cass Cliatt . Friedsam came right out and asked his professors at Georgetown if it was all right for him to continue to ask a lot of questions . He got the official OK . At Penn State , Green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have something to say I think they 're going to benefit by , " he says , " I keep my mouth shut . " <p> Other colleges seek to avoid the issue entirely by simply not allowing retirees to audit undergraduate classes . The University of Notre Dame in Indiana does not allow residents of the nearby Holy Cross Village at Notre Dame to audit courses ( although another college does ) . " Residents may be involved in a variety of activities at Notre Dame and get a library card , but auditing courses is not one of the options , at least at this point , " says Dennis Brown , the university 's assistant vice president of news and information . Harvard University generally does not let anyone audit undergraduate classes , either . <p> Free tuition . Part of the generational conflict stems from the pocketbook . Older students can often audit classes free or for a small fee , while the younger student next to them is paying upwards of $20,000 for tuition at private schools to receive credit for the same class . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida , Illinois , Maryland , Minnesota , New Jersey , Vermont , and Virginia , have adopted statewide tuition waivers for senior citizens who wish to take classes at public institutions , although sometimes a fee is required . <p> Other colleges offer classes exclusively for people age 50 and older . The Osher Lifelong Learning Institute is a collection of programs at 93 colleges across the country that offer senior citizens non-credit classes that usually last from four to eight weeks . The courses have no papers or exams and usually cost between $25 and $450 , although the rules and fees for every program are different . A quick call to your local college should be able to tell you if there is any type of senior citizen audit program . <p> Marina Stites , who has been taking classes at Portland State University for eight years since retiring from the office of her husband , a chiropractor , says , " I was really amazed that the kids accepted me so beautifully . " In fact , the only time that Stites , 75 , ever found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she took a dance class . " You had to change partners , " Stites says . " And when some of the guys got me they went , ' Oh , my God ! ' " <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Al Green waits for a political science class to start at Penn State . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By Emily Brandon <p> A Permanent Homecoming <p> College is often a respite of study and play for young people before entering the world of work , but college-flavored retirement communities are becoming an increasingly attractive place for their elders to settle when they stop working . <p> Some 50 colleges now have retirement communities on campus or nearby . " These are about the nicest form of socioeconomic activity that a college community can attract , " says John Diffey , the president of KendalCorp. , a nonprofit organization affiliated with 13 retirement communities near campuses such as Oberlin College , Denison University , and Ithaca College . " They do n't add children to the school system " or increase demand for additional municipal services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential donors in close proximity to colleges . In addition to alumni , many residents are retired faculty and staff , the parents of current faculty and staff , or people who simply love the college way of life . " The baby boomers are the most educated group of seniors to come along , " says William Frey , a Brookings Institution demographer . " Among well-educated boomers , now entering their late 50s and early 60s , these college towns seem to be a coming attraction . " <p> Game tickets . The draw of college communities is the combination of a small-town feel with extensive amenities . " It 's a little more luxurious than the dorms , " says Jeoffrey Stross , president of the board at University Commons , a retirement home affiliated with the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor . University Commons was built on land sold to the condominium association by the university , but the college still owns the 12 acres of land surrounding the building , which remains wooded . Students of traditional college age are often incorporated into life at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University Commons residents two nights a week , nursing students are developing exercise programs with residents , and music students and faculty often perform . Many communities also feature access to the university library , tickets to sporting events , and on-site health- and long-term care . <p> But living in a college-affiliated retirement community does n't come cheap . Entry fees for Holy Cross Village at Notre Dame range from $101,900 to $275,900 , in addition to monthly service fees that are $1,595 and up for the first person and $795 for the second person . The entry fee is 90 percent refundable to heirs when the resident dies , or to the resident if he or she leaves the community and the apartment is resold . The apartments at Holy Cross Village are over 90 percent reserved . <p> It may be a small price to pay for another shot at campus fun . Residents of the Village at Penn State , for instance , join the homecoming parade every year . This year , as their bus blared " YMCA , " they dressed up as-natch-the Village People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
