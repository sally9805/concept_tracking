They 're coming of age : new generations of Europe 's reigning clans . T &C; takes a look at some who were born to wear the crown in the family-and some who weren't. // Like Sleeping Beauty 's castle after its mistress 's century-long slumber party , many of Europe 's monarchies seem overdue for refurbishment . Though established sovereigns such as Britain 's Queen Elizabeth II still command great respect , they are often felt to be out of touch with modern life and , at the same time , diminished by it . Marital scandals have tainted their families ' images , as have public gripes about their finances . Meanwhile , some of the older heirs to European thrones , who once seemed glamorous and full of hope for the future , have begun to appear frustrated and sidelined in middle age . Luckily , new generations of young royalty are coming to the fore . These are not simply fresh faces : they are standard-bearers for the new millennium who , having grown up in an increasingly informal and media-driven age and seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family members , are in a far better position to cope with it . The real question is whether they will : whether they have the character and strength to do their duty-and live their lives-in ways that suit their countries , their times and themselves . " Being a young royal in 2003 is not a hazard-free occupation , " says John Kennedy , publisher and editor of the Almanack de Gotha , the definitive directory of European nobility . " On one side there 's unbridled sycophancy , and on the other there 's unrestrained and often unfair criticism . It 's a miracle that they do n't all go off the rails . " Plenty of them , though , have given their families a fright : Crown Princes Felipe of Spain and Frederik of Denmark in particular have caused consternation by dating lingerie models . As in Sleeping Beauty 's day , a successful match is still seen as vital to the popularity of a monarch and to the security of his or her family-but this is just one factor that makes the following eight young royals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Eldest of King Carl Gustaf and Queen Silvia 's three children , and heir to the throne . Her younger brother , Carl Philip , who traditionally would have inherited under the rules of primogeniture , lost out when the law of succession was changed just after his birth to allow age to take precedence over sex . Descended from : Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte , one of Napoleon 's marshals , who was invited to succeed the childless King Charles XIII in 1810 and whose surname the royal family still bears . The present king and queen met in 1972 at the Munich Olympic Games , where she was working as chief hostess for the organizing committee . Principal residence : Drottningholm , her parents ' magnificent Baroque palace outside Stockholm-though she also has her own flat in the old part of the city .

" There were some people who really tried to use her friendship , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think she saw through that and was really disappointed in them . " Much respected for her openness-she recently admitted to being dyslexic-and her newfound ability to laugh things off . Has said she finds her life fascinating , but added , " There are times when you wish you were somewhere else-and someone else . " Life so far : Educated in Sweden and in France , then took courses at Yale ( history and political science ) .

Looks : Blonde , blue-eyed and dazzlingly beautiful . Character : Though known as the " Party Princess , " she claims that reports of her nightclubbing till five in the morning are exaggerated-and who are we to disbelieve her ? " The family 's advisers are trying to get her to calm down a bit , " says Magnus Alselind of the Swedish newspaper Expressen , " but she 's obviously not that worried about it . She turned up at the Nobel Prize dinner , for example , in a very low-cut outfit . " Life so far : Educated in Stockholm .

" Where to see this summer : Out on the town with her friends in Stureplan ( Stockholm 's answer to New York 's SoHo ) . PRINCE WILLIAM OF GREAT BRITAIN Succession status : As elder son of the Prince of Wales and the late Princess Diana , he 's second in line to the British throne , but since the queen 's reign could last a long time yet , there has been speculation that he might succeed her instead of Prince Charles ( something his mother advocated ) .

Although he has a boisterous side , in public he remains guarded ; his mother once described him as " a deep thinker , " and time has borne this out . " He 's level-headed , " says John Kennedy . " My belief is that the adulation probably horrifies him , because he 's seen what it can turn into , so he does n't appear as outgoing as he would like to be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's death when he was fifteen , William achieved unexpectedly good academic results while at Eton College ; also excelled at swimming , polo and water polo . Has undertaken community work in Chile and tramped through Central American jungles with the British Army .

According to Christopher Andersen , author of Diana 's Boys , he and his brother , Harry , have a good relationship with their father 's companion , Camilla Parker-Bowles : " A friend said the reason they like her is she 's nothing like their mother . She 's not a threat at all . She has promised that she will not marry their father without their approval .

You know not to disturb him . " Life so far : Said to have been even harder hit than William by their mother 's death .

" Known at Eton College , which he leaves this year , as an accomplished sportsman and a hard worker . Likes to wear : T-shirts , baseball caps , cargo pants . Likes to date : No preferences have yet emerged , but Tatler magazine recently named him the most datable man in Britain ( William , at school in Scotland , did n't meet the magazine 's criterion of a London base ) .
