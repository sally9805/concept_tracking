Caught between a tyke and a teen , weatherman AI Roker braves parenting 's storms Photograph " Courtney 's been the princess , " says Roker ( cuddling Leila as big sis watches ) . " She shares the throne now , but she embraces that : ' // To those who see his cheery weather reports on NBC 's Today show , Al Roker seems as sunny as a cloudless July day at the beach . But Roker , 45 , needs all his good nature to deal with the high-pressure systems of parenting . " It 's the toughest job going , and there 's no manual , " says Roker . " But there 's a lot of on-the-job training . " The oldest of six children raised in Queens by Al Sr. , 68 , a bus driver , and his wife , Isabel , 66 , a homemaker , Roker says he always understood that families are not democracies . " My dad was n't my friend , he was my father , " Roker says . " But he always made sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to extend the same tough love to his own daughters from two marriages , Courtney , 13 , and Leila , 18 months . But is he capable of drill sergeant discipline ? Not according to his wife , Deborah Roberts , a correspondent for ABC 's 20/20 and cohost of the Lifetime network 's Lifetime Live . " He thinks he 's the ambassador to kids all over the world , " she says . " When Courtney says he 's doing something embarrassing , I tell her , Look , he 's just a kid ! What can you do ? " ' In the following exclusive excerpt from his first book , Do n't Make Me Stop This Car ! Adventures in Fatherhood , out this month , Roker the kid battles Roker the grown-up . In a futile attempt to thwart the inevitable , we all swear we will not become our parents . But we have genetic code built into us that guarantees we will . You ca n't avoid it . Save the money you 'd spend on therapy and get a good home theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't necessarily a bad thing . My dad is a really good guy . I think the world of him . If anything , I think some of my flaws may come from my feelings that I will never be as good a father as my dad is . For openers , he and my mom have been together for 47 years . He gave me and my five siblings something money ca n't buy : a loving home with two parents . It 's something I ca n't give my daughter Courtney because of my divorce . And do n't think it is n't something that weighs on me whenever I go to one of her recitals or plays or every time I say good night to her over the phone when she 's in her house and I 'm in mine . I had always sworn to myself that when I became a father , I would be a cool dad . I would n't use those tired old sayings that have been passed on from generation to generation . You know the ones : " When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar . " ( " They had folding money back then , Dad ? " ) Or how about when you apologized for a screw-up and your old man came back with : " Well , sorry did n't put out the garbage , did it ? Sorry does n't walk the dog . Sorry wo n't do your homework . " Okay , Dad , I GET IT ! ! ! Photograph For Roker ( in ' ' 72 ) , life at home was crowded but full of love . Photograph Roker calls his dad , Al Sr. ( with Isabel in ' ' 95 ) , strict but also " the original sensitive guy . We all felt we were his favorite . " // Until recently I had avoided using those dad-isms . But not long ago I realized I had taken the first step in becoming my father . I was driving Courtney and two of her cousins down to Six Flags Great Adventure , the amusement park in central New Jersey . Traffic was bad , and the kids were worse . We were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took , the worse these kids became . I begged , pleaded and cajoled , trying to get them calmed down . Finally those six little words-the ones I heard my father say to us some 30 years ago-just popped out of my mouth : DO N'T MAKE ME STOP THIS CAR ! ! ! When my father said it , the phrase struck fear into our entire brood . We knew my father would stop the car . We did n't want to find out what would happen if he did . Our minds boggled at the possibilities . As I 'm driving my family in our spiffy minivan/sport utility/station wagon/assault vehicle , I realize that as a father I fall between diapers and hormones , between Barney and Britney Spears . Kids 10 and under are dependent on you for the basic necessities of life , and they know it . Sustenance , clothing , shelter and video games . Chances are you 're still bigger than they are . Control is still within your grasp . Enjoy it . I know from whence I speak . You see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a toddler and in the very back seat of the truck a ( gulp ) freshly minted teenager . Raging hormones and excessive exposure to MTV have rendered my once precious baby into a sullen know-itall who barely tolerates me . Photograph It 's hard to admit Courtney ( in ' ' 96 ) is growing up , Roker says . // I was 32 when Courtney arrived . She 's 13 now . Hey , that 's not so bad . I 've got plenty of guy friends in their mid-40s with teenagers . The problem is , I 've got plenty of guy friends in their mid-40s who have spankin ' ' , brand-new babies . You do the math . Leila 's almost 2 . When she 's 10 , I 'm 54 . When she 's 20 , I 'm 64 . When she 's 30 . . . well , you get the idea . It 's a little depressing . You think I 'm kidding ? When I get down on the floor to play with Leila , it 's taking me a little longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get up . In fact , I just lie on the floor and let her find the little bags of Cheerios I have stashed in various pockets . Sort of Daddy as Treasure Island . Playing " horsie " makes Daddy wish that they would take Ol ' Paint to the glue factory and call it a day . I look forward to playing hide " n ' seek so I can find a reeeallly good hiding spot and take a nap . With Courtney I have a whole different set of issues than I do with Leila Ruth . Music , schoolwork , getting her into a convent until she 's 30 . Things like that . I find that all the things I wreaked upon my parents as a teenager are being revisited upon me as an adult . The car seems to be a focal point for our differences . Like any healthy , red-blooded American teen , Courtney enjoys listening to the radio . In our area that would be a station that plays a mix of rock , rap , R &B; and pop . Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hear a song on that station that has n't been played within the last , say , 10 minutes , she 's got the radio programmed to a variety of stations that will play her music . Photograph " I knew he 'd be a good dad , " Roberts says of Roker ( ca. ' ' 75 ) . // When I was a teenager , my dad had a simple rule : " He who steers the car controls the radio . " Guess who always steered the car when he was in the car ? You got it . Plus , technology was working against me . In my day , you actually had to tune the radio-fiddle with the dial and land that red line on your station . Today all kids have to do is hit a button and bang , they 've got their station . Of course , there 's always a fight in the car . Is it Barney , Lauryn Hill or the traffic report ? While Leila is much too young to reach the radio button , she can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today show fans in New York City ) says , " We all want our kids to be good citizens . " // I look in my rearview mirror and see both my girls . It was n't that long ago that Courtney was in the car seat . So no matter how nutty the ride gets , as long as they are in the car , I feel lucky and blessed . On November 17 , 1999 , Leila celebrated her first birthday . It was a quiet affair , just us and a couple of friends to sing " Happy Birthday " and cut a small cake to mark the day . If I 've learned anything from experience , it 's that a big birthday party for a 1-year-old is a BIG mistake . First of all , a 1-year-old has NO idea what 's going on . All she knows is that there are a whole lot of people around , making a whole lot of noise . After a while , baby gets overstimulated , eats too much cake or ice cream , throws up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this with Courtney , I vowed not to make the same mistake twice . Hence , the very understated birthday party at which we almost outnumbered the guests . An hour later everyone was gone and Leila was asleep . Deborah sat next to me on the couch in our family room and said , " You seem a little down this evening . What 's bothering you ? " It was a feeling that had crept up on me , sort of like my underwear . One minute you 're feeling good , and the next minute cotton and elastic have found their way into your nether regions . While Deborah got ready for bed , I sat and pondered . At first , I denied it . What could possibly be wrong ? After all , my little girl had just turned one , and she was intelligent , beautiful , spunky and full of personality . Leila was a healthy , normal , fun-loving 1-yearold . So why did I feel melancholy ? Then it hit me : I did n't want her to grow up . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would somehow miraculously skirt Leila , allowing her to remain in this pretoddler stage a little longer . I love our nonverbal conversations when it 's time for bed . Her tiny arms wrap themselves around my shoulders as best they can and she holds on for all she 's worth . It all changes as she gets older . They are all good changes , but they are different ones . The hug I get from Courtney when I leave her on a Sunday night is as good as it gets . There are times I never want to let go of her . Maybe when I do , she 'll be my little girl again , wanting nothing more than to go see The Little Mermaid or Aladdin instead of Scream 7 : The Retirement Years ! Photograph Roberts ( with Al in ' ' 99 ) feared he revealed too much . " But it meant a lot for AI to express his feelings " // I got out of bed and went into Leila 's room to look at her . There she was , stretched out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her Winnie the Pooh stuffed cube , breathing to a rhythm set by angels . As I looked down into that crib I almost got dizzy thinking about everything there is to come : school , friends , heartache , dating , college , marriage , babies and her crazy old father to deal with . All that lay ahead of this sleeping cherub . At the same time , north of Manhattan , an intelligent , beautiful teenager is wrestling with coming of age , boys , friends and impending high school . This truly is an adventure I would n't trade for anything . And with any luck , while Deborah 's guard is down , maybe we can start another adventure . Got ta go ! <p>
