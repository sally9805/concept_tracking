Section : FITNESS THE MARINES HAVE A NEW $12 MILLION TRAINING PROGRAM . FOLLOW ORDERS AND YOU , TOO , WILL BECOME A HARD-BODY <p> IT WAS 0600 AT THE MARINE Instructor-Trainer School in Quantico , Virginia , and someone had parked in Lieutenant Colonel George Bristol 's spot . A small squad of marines , dressed in fatigues , had surrounded the offending vehicle and were plotting a predawn strike . Finally , one of them popped the lock and pulled the trigger on the parking brake , and together they heaved it out of the way .... <p> Bristol is a big gun of a man with a personality like cold steel , but he tells this story as sweetly as if he were reminiscing about a childhood Christmas . As he lounges in his foxhole of an office at Quantico , his bayonet-blue eyes suddenly lose some of their usual glint and he swipes a callused knuckle across a nose that 's been broken multiple times . " I have a very strong bond with all my marines , " the 44-year-old 26-year veteran tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot , but they 're like my sons . Sometimes you have to kick ' em , and sometimes you have to lick ' em . For a marine , the team is everything . " <p> Recently , the Corps rolled out a $12 million training program designed to remake its team into the most fearsome fighting force ever created and its soldiers the ultimate warrior/athletes . It 's called the Marine Corps Martial Arts Program , and it 's designed to not only attract new recruits but also toughen and remotivate the veterans . <p> But do n't let the name fool you . " There is no Eastern mysticism involved , " says Bristol . " We do n't contemplate our navels . " <p> To the marines , " martial " means " military . " These are the " military arts " they 're teaching , adapted from such diverse fighting cultures as the samurai , Apaches , Zulus , and Spartans . The only element of mainstream martial arts that 's been retained is a belt system through which all marines will progress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make every enlisted man not only an accredited black belt but also a gentleman . <p> At first , this may sound like a contradictory set of orders , especially after meeting some of the program 's leatherneck creators . Bristol , whose specialty is bayonet fighting , often snarls when he speaks . Master Gunnery Sergeant Cardo Urso , 42 , whose knuckles are so thickly callused they resemble little noses , is an expert in chokeholds , face rips , nerve strikes , and a death point called " stomach 9 . " Lieutenant Jesse Lee Sjoberg , 28 , whose everyday expression is as intense as a butane flame , keeps a set of large knives , a copy of The Dark Side of Man , and a jug of Fierce Lime Gatorade on his desk . And their half-dozen drill instructors all wear black sweatshirts with blood-red lettering that reads , " One Mind , Any Weapon . " <p> No doubt about it , these are intense men in the business of training others to be proficient killers . Depending on your opinion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But what you ca n't help wanting to emulate is their level of physical conditioning . While few have Adonis physiques , they all possess a lean , do-anything hardness more impressive than that of most athletes . And even more remarkable is that this fitness has been built in the simplest of ways , using body weight , partner resistance , and gritted teeth . <p> At the heart of the new training program is a concept called " conversion conditioning . " The goal of Bristol and his officers is to convert the basic strength , endurance , and callusing that marines acquire at boot camp into power , toughness , and integrity . With their help , we 're going to show you how to do the same . But be forewarned : This is not a get-back-in-shape , beginner 's program . It assumes a respectable level of fitness and a desire to go beyond it . And if you do , the benefits that accrue will be more than physical . You 'll start to get a sense of the core marine values of honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with greater confidence . As Bristol puts it , " We 're out to create a person who is so highly skilled that he can function in the cauldron of combat , yet has ethics , compassion , and discipline . This is the warrior gentleman . " <p> All of us do battle every day in some small way . Our cauldron of combat may be the commuter lane , the workplace , or the dinner table across which we face our teenagers . Here 's how the marines get ready for it . Here 's how they build combat fitness . Here , sir , are the seven rules of engagement . RULE #1 : YOU 'LL PUSH YOURSELF HARDER IF YOU TRAIN WITH A PARTNER <p> I am so wet , cold , and exhausted that I feel like one of Private Ryan 's dead brothers . My fatigues are soaked , my helmet is askew , and with 30 pounds of gear on my back , I can hardly move . <p> My platoon is in the midst of an outdoor " thrash session "  --  12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and interspersed with fighting drills . A big lieutenant and I alternate throwing one another to the ground . After hitting the deck a half-dozen times , I honestly can not tell if it 's the sod squishing or my intestines . <p> Each time I get up , I remind myself that I do n't have to do this , that I 'm not enlisted . But the sergeants have split our class into two competing groups of a dozen marines apiece . If I go AWOL , my team suffers . And therein lies the first lesson . <p> A common reason exercise programs fail and fat wars are lost is that it 's only you against the enemy . A training partner supplies motivation , exerts subtle peer pressure , and threatens your fragile ego . Whether you 're grunting out final repetitions of a bench press or running one last interval , you 'll respond better and push yourself farther if there 's someone to encourage and challenge you . <p> " C'm on ! You can make it ! " yells that big lieutenant . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : NEVER LET YOURSELF GET INTO A RHYTHM <p> Not far from the aforementioned field of screams is a 3-mile stamina course that winds across broken terrain . There 's one particularly steep hill , crowned by scrub brush , where Lieutenant Colonel Bristol likes to hide out . With a banshee yell and a bayonet thrust , he springs out at every marine who approaches . " I push ' em back down that hill six or seven times before I let ' em move on , " he says . And this is n't the only interruption . As the marines run the course with rifles and packs , they 're stopped every quarter mile or so by their drill instructors and made to fight back . Punches , kicks , falls .... It 's impossible to find a rhythm . <p> But that 's the point . When you get into a rhythm , you get into a comfort zone . After you become proficient in an activity , conversion conditioning requires that you modify that activity in order to keep it challenging . For example , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a steady pace , try running on trails , where you 're constantly refining balance and speed . Or instead of cycling steadily at 15 mph , do a series of surges in which you raise your speed to 18 mph for 30 seconds . The idea is to disturb the body 's equilibrium and , by doing so , raise fitness . <p> This theory holds true for training programs , as well . Too many guys exercise the same way every workout . Other than weaponry , the marines do n't specialize in anything . They 're cross-trainers . Try changing your primary fitness activity every 3 months and see how much fitter you become . RULE #3 : HIT AND BE HIT <p> In the early morning , a line of already-sweaty marines kneels on mats in the base gymnasium . Their hands are raised in front of their chests , and on each whistle blast they fall forward onto their forearms . It makes for strange music : Tweet ! BLAM ! Tweet ! BLAM ! Tweet ! BLAM ! This is a body-hardening drill designed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , to the front , the sides , and the rear , until the sting of the vinyl subsides and they wear a natural armor veneer . <p> Body hardening is a big part of conversion conditioning . It 's akin to making jerky from fresh meat . Besides these impact drills , the marines also toughen themselves by boxing  --  2 minutes in a quartered-off ring , wearing huge gloves that feel as if you 're swinging sledgehammers by round 's end . " The Corps had gotten away from boxing for fear somebody would get hurt , " says Bristol . " Well , guess what ? This is n't the Girl Scouts . Close interpersonal violence brings you to a new level of physical and mental awareness . " <p> We 're not advocating going out to the nearest bar and slugging someone . But it 's beneficial to rough yourself up a little . Practice tumbling on mats , wrestle with someone other than your girlfriend , take boxing lessons , or order some 18-ounce gloves and headgear from www.ringside.com and start your own Fight Club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it 'll accustom you to getting hit and expose another dimension of fitness . It 'll make you resilient . RULE #4 : IF YOU DO N'T HAVE A GOAL , YOU DO N'T HAVE A SOUL <p> A year-2000 survey of the U.S. armed forces found that 7 percent of marines had not exercised in the last week . That was better than the air force ( 23 percent ) , navy ( 16 percent ) , and army ( 9 percent ) , but far from the steely ideal . The new marine training program is designed to stomp out sloth by keeping troops marching toward a higher goal . This is done by way of a martial-arts belt system . A tan belt is awarded upon graduation from boot camp , and advancement through gray , green , brown , and six degrees of black belts follows . ( Instead of wearing them decoratively like karate sashes , marines use them functionally , to hold up trousers . ) <p> Such a system is important because , in Bristol 's world , there are two states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where most men get stuck , defining themselves either by what they are now or by what they used to be . It 's an end state . The latter , however , is where most men should be , defining themselves either by where they 're heading or by what they 'll one day achieve . It 's a beginning . <p> This is the secret to reaching increasingly higher levels of fitness . An exercise program without a goal is doomed to failure . The mistake most men make is thinking that " losing weight " and " getting back in shape " are adequate goals . They 're not . Just like the qualifications for earning green , brown , and black belts , they must be specific . Better that your goal be " to lose 10 pounds by December 1 " or " to get in good enough shape to take this month 's Men 's Health Challenge . " Specific goals are like crosshairs in a rifle sight . You need them to hit your target . RULE #5 : IT 'S NOT THE GEAR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IT <p> You wo n't see any Capilene or Synchilla labels on clothes the marines are issued . Rather , it 's mostly cotton and wool , with only a grudging nod to Gore-Tex . Nor is the base gym filled with rows of high-tech fitness machines . It 's striking how the Corps can train the ultimate warrior/athlete with so little help from exercise science . <p> But there 's a reason the brass prefers canteens to CamelBaks . As part of their training , marines study martial cultures such as those of the Spartans , Zulus , and Apaches . These were some of the fiercest fighters in history , yet they succeeded with little more than a spear backed by spirit . <p> " Lots of guys today are gear freaks , " says Bristol . " They think they need all this fancy stuff to get fit . But that 's bullshit . If you want aerobic fitness , hike with a pack . If you want to strengthen every muscle in your body , do bench presses , squats , and power cleans . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do the workout Bristol 's officers designed , starting on page 127 . It calls for only a folding chair and an inner tube . RULE #6 : TO BUILD POWER AND SPEED , EXERCISE EXPLOSIVELY <p> Marines are like coiled springs . On the surface they may appear relaxed and well polished , but deeper down , at a muscular level , they are tightly wound . Should the situation warrant , they 're capable of striking with deadly force in a moment . Warriors are intimidating because you can sense this ability , this tethered power . It 's a daunting something you 'd love to have . And you can . Because it 's not natural ; it 's cultivated . <p> The marines develop it in two ways . First , they exercise explosively . Once they 've acquired basic strength and endurance , they do their drills faster and more forcefully . For example , instead of traditional leg squats , they substitute " star jumpers " ( see page 128 ) . Instructors make even traditional weight exercises more explosive by requiring troops to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets . Standing in waist-deep water and kicking as hard as possible is another drill that builds explosive power . " We 're not as interested in forklift strength as we are in strength times speed , " explains Bristol . <p> The second way it 's developed is through weighted aerobic training . Marines are legendary for marching great distances with 50-pound packs . And this has not changed . But when they take those packs off , they suddenly feel like a warmup bat minus the weighted doughnut . <p> You can achieve the same training effect by walking or running with a backpack . But if you 're confined to urban wilderness , a less-conspicuous alternative may be a weighted vest . Called " extra-load conditioning , " the process is akin to exercising in hypergravity . Studies have found significant improvements in explosive power ( jumping ) and cardiovascular stamina ( running to exhaustion ) after 3 to 6 weeks of wearing approximately 10 percent of body weight . The $135 to $180 SmartVest by Training Zone Concepts ( www.smartvest.net , 888-797-8378 ) is a well-made , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RULE #7 : HEROISM IS ENDURANCE FOR ONE MOMENT MORE <p> By the end of day one in the Martial Arts Program , there is blood , snot , skinned knuckles , and hound-dog exhaustion among us . I 'm about to lay down arms in a hot tub , but somehow my comrades must endure 6 full weeks of this . Still , what 's most important is that we 've survived , and in a battle of any kind , that 's sweet victory . The state we 're in now is where we 're most malleable . It 's at this moment that the warrior/athlete begins to take shape . <p> " Most men do n't exercise , " says Bristol with a scowl , " but hard physical exercise is the basis for character development . If you 're able to do these things , break through these barriers , you 'll develop mental toughness . This is how integrity is built . " <p> It 's important for marines to possess these qualities because combat is , above all else , confusing . The first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says he forgot about " all that John Wayne crap and wanted another flak jacket and two more helmets . " But what got him through was knowing that his mind could overrule his body when it demanded surrender and , conversely , that his body would instinctively do the right thing when his mind hesitated . <p> Bristol learned this through training , by continually pushing past his " uncle point " and resisting the temptation to quit . The marines use physical demands , sleep deprivation , and even verbal abuse to teach this . Eventually , they hone not only mental toughness but also basic motor skills . These are the mechanics that keep a man marching or fighting long after his energy deserts . They form the bedrock that makes a fearful situation more stable . <p> Instilling this in yourself is as simple as gutting out a few extra repetitions on every lift , or sprinting for 10 , 20 , or 30 seconds at the end of each run . You 'll soon find that there 's always a little more left , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a century , or a long-distance hike next . You will reach a point during it when your body insists on stopping , but you wo n't let it . Then , farther along , will come another point when your mind no longer cares but your body automatically continues . When this happens , you 'll have met your warrior/athlete . And Bristol , by god , will salute you . ARE YOU MARINE TOUGH ? <p> The Marine Corps uses the following test to gauge the physical fitness of its troops . See if you have the strength and stamina to pass muster . YOUR ORDERS <p> Chinups : Grasp the bar using whatever hand position feels comfortable . With feet off the floor , pull up until your chin is above the bar , then lower yourself until your arms are fully extended again . Repeat to exhaustion . <p> Modified situps : Lie on your back with knees flexed , feet flat on the floor , and arms folded across your chest . ( Arms must remain against the chest throughout the exercise ; a buddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added leverage . ) Raise your upper body until your elbows or forearms touch your thighs , then return to the starting position . Do as many as you can in 2 minutes . <p> 3-mile run : Done as fast as possible over reasonably level terrain . YOUR SCORE <p> Chinups :  --  ( number done x 5 ) <p> Situps :  --  ( number done ) <p> Run :  --  ( points , based on the following scale : time of 18:00 = 100 points , 18:10 = 99 points , 18:20 = 98 points , 18:30 = 97 points , and so on ; round time to the next highest tenth ) <p> Total score :  --  ( add the three numbers ) TABLE THE MEN 'S HEALTH MARINE CORPS WORKOUT <p> The following program , designed exclusively for Men 's Health by marine martial-arts instructors at Quantico , Virginia , includes 14 exercises that can be done in 30 to 40 minutes with nothing more than a folding chair and an inner tube . It 's a total-body workout designed to build not only strength and endurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new marine . Do it daily if you want , flowing from one exercise to the next for extra aerobic benefit . <p> GRIPPERS : Extend both arms straight overhead , then quickly open and close your hands for 30 seconds . Repeat with arms extended in front , and then to either side . <p> SHADOWBOXING : 10 lead-hand jabs , 10 rear-hand jabs , 10 left hooks , 10 right hooks , 10 left uppercuts , 10 right uppercuts . Repeat this series two or three times while moving on your feet like a boxer ; as fitness builds , increase the repetitions or hold light dumbbells . <p> RESISTED PUNCHING : Tie a bicycle inner tube to a doorknob . Close the door , then practice punching : 10 to 20 with the lead hand , 10 to 20 with the rear hand . For extra power , twist your hips before delivering the punch . <p> WALL CHAIR : With your back against a smooth wall , slowly squat and walk your feet out until your thighs are parallel to the floor . It should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hold for 60 seconds . <p> SIDE KICKS : 10 left-leg kicks , 10 right-leg kicks . Repeat this series two or three times , holding the back of a folding chair for support if necessary ; as fitness and flexibility increase , kick above the chair seat and then , eventually , above the chair back . <p> CHINESE PUSHUPS : Bend over and put your hands on the floor . Walk them forward until your torso and legs form an inverted V , as shown . Make a triangle with your hands by bringing the tips of your index fingers and thumbs together . Then use your arms to lower yourself until your nose touches the triangle . Repeat five to 10 times . <p> BOOT SLAPPERS : Stand with legs slightly more than shoulder-width apart , squat down , slap the sides of your ankles , then stand back up . Repeat 10 to 20 times . <p> DIVE-BOMBERS : Put your hands and feet on the floor so your body forms an inverted V. In one fluid motion , bend your arms , sweep your upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then push your torso up until your head is up , your back is arched , and your arms are straight , with your elbows locked . Hold this for a few seconds , then push back to the start . ( Only your hands and toes ever touch the floor . ) Repeat five to 10 times . <p> KOREAN JUMPING JACKS : Stand with your hands behind your head , then drop down onto one knee . Stand back up , then do the same with the other leg . Alternate for a 20 count . <p> BICYCLE : Lie on your back with your hands behind your head , legs extended , and feet a few inches off the floor . Touch your right elbow to your left knee as shown , then your left elbow to your right knee . Continue alternating for a total count of 20 . ( Keep your feet off the floor and your lower back against the floor at all times . ) <p> STAR JUMPERS : Just like boot slappers , only after squatting , explode upward while extending your arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your back with legs and arms extended . Keeping your knees and elbows locked , simultaneously raise your legs and upper body while trying to touch your fingers to your toes . Repeat five to 10 times . <p> PUSH-AWAYS : Lie on your back with your hands on your chest , legs extended , feet a few inches off the ground , and head curled forward . Alternately bring each knee toward your head , then forcefully kick forward . ( Do n't let your feet touch the floor . ) Do 10 with each leg . <p> HIP RAISES : Lie on your back with your palms on the ground and your legs extended overhead . Raise your hips a few inches off the floor , using as little arm leverage as possible . Repeat 10 to 15 times . GIVE YOURSELF THE BOOT <p> Although Danner boots are not standard Marine Corps issue , they 're the ones marines upgrade to during grave footwear crises . The $235 uninsulated Fort Lewis model shown here is handmade in Portland , Oregon . With a full-grain leather upper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an entire tour of duty and then some . It also comes in insulated ( $250 ) and steel-toed ( $290 ) versions . www.danner.com <p> By Joe Kita <p>
