A crackle in the brush . That 's the sound the Afghan herder recalls hearing as he walked alone through a pine forest last month . When he looked up , he saw an American commando , his legs and shoulder bloodied . The commando pointed his gun at the Afghan . " Maybe he thought I was a Taliban , " says the shepherd , Gulab . " I remembered hearing that if an American sticks up his thumb , it is a friendly gesture . So that 's what I did . " To make sure the message was clear , Gulab lifted his tunic to show the American he was n't hiding a weapon . He then propped up the wounded commando , and together the pair hobbled down the steep mountain trail to Sabari-Minah , a cluster of adobe-and-wood homes  --  crossing , for the time being , to safety . <P> What Gulab did not know is that the commando he encountered was part of a team of Navy SEALs that had been missing for four days after being ambushed by Taliban insurgents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search mission to find the missing SEALs ended in disaster on June 28 , when a Chinook helicopter carrying 16 service members was shot down over Kunar province , killing everyone aboard , in one of the deadliest attacks so far on U.S. forces in Afghanistan . Since then , the bodies of two of the missing SEALs have been recovered ; another is still classified as missing , though the Taliban claims he was captured and beheaded . <P> One member of the team did survive . Though the military has not released the name of the SEAL ( the U.S. military seldom gives out the names of its special-operations personnel ) , TIME pieced together his story on the basis of briefings with U.S. military officials in Afghanistan plus an exclusive account of how Gulab , an Afghan herdsman , rescued the wounded commando . What emerges is the tale of a courageous U.S. fighter facing impossible odds in unfamiliar terrain , stalked by the enemy and stripped of everything but his gun and his will to survive . But it is also a story of mercy and fraternity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Afghan mountains , little shoots of humanity sometimes have a chance to grow . <P> The clashes in Kunar province have highlighted a worrying surge in violence in Afghanistan , where 15,000 U.S. troops are based . Several months ago , U.S. and Afghan officials claimed the Taliban was a spent force . But the Islamist fighters and their al-Qaeda allies have sprung back with fresh recruits , new weaponry and advanced bombmaking skills passed on to them by terrorists in Iraq , officials in Kabul say . <P> It was in response to signs of a mounting threat from Taliban fighters that the four-man commando team found itself in the Afghan forests of Kunar province on June 28 , maneuvering under low clouds and a drenching rain . The mission , code-named Operation Redwing , was to find and engage the enemy . But in late afternoon , the commandos sent back a one-line message to the " Ark , " a coalition-forces operations room in Kabul . Accompanied by a warning chime , it read , " Troops in contact . " Translation : a fire fight was under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
