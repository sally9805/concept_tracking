Early in his tour around the bleak world of low-paying jobs , David Shipler describes a kind of domino model of a downward economic spiral . " A rundown apartment can exacerbate a child 's asthma , which leads to a call for an ambulance , which generates a medical bill that can not be paid , which ruins a credit record , which hikes the interest rate on an auto loan , which forces the purchase of an unreliable used car , which jeopardizes a mother 's punctuality at work , which limits her promotions and earning capacity , which confines her to poor housing . " Which exacerbates the asthma , and so on . <P> What Shipler aims to do in The Working Poor : Invisible in America ( Knopf ; 319 pages ) is to produce a picture of all of those dominoes at once , the multitude of obstacles that keep the working poor on the edge  --  and sometimes beyond the edge  --  of household-finance disaster . As the gap between the highest-and lowest-paid workers steadily worsens , he writes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard work cures poverty . " <P> A Pulitzer-prizewinning former reporter for the New York Times , Shipler interviewed scores of people for this book  --  waitresses , shelf stockers , farm laborers , plus the social workers , union organizers and job trainers around them and the employers who take them on , not all of whom are crocodiles . His book lacks the first-person focus and angry wit of Nickel and Dimed , TIME contributor Barbara Ehrenreich 's account of her attempts to get by on $6 or $7 an hour . But poverty is in the details , and he lays those out in abundance . <P> Just consider his dissection of the extortionate loan fees that are a staple of life for anybody who does n't quite make it from paycheck to paycheck . Convenience stores in poor neighborhoods routinely advance cash to their customers at interest rates of about 20% for a two-week loan . If the debt ca n't be repaid , it 's gladly rolled over  --  for another 20% . One study in Illinois found that the average customer had 10 renewals of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few months , he or she owed twice as much in interest as the amount that had been borrowed . <P> The essence of Shipler 's message is that working poverty is a seamless web of challenges , some personal , some erected by a society content to let the federal minimum wage languish at $5.15 an hour . And that 's for those who can avoid the unscrupulous bosses who make workers falsify their time sheets so they work longer hours for the same pay . Then there are the fruit pickers who have exorbitant housing costs deducted by labor contractors who warehouse the workers in filthy barracks . As for garment workers , they can be paid at piece rates  --  try three-fourths of a cent per piece to sew in a zipper on jeans  --  that make it nearly impossible to earn the minimum .
