The Mailbox By Audrey Shafer Random House Audrey Shafer Vernon Culligan was as good as dead to the town of Drayford , Virginia , for so long that when he actually died , not many folks noticed . For decades , his bloodshot eyes , permanent three-day stubble , rifle held over his head , and snarl meaner than a coon dog 's had naturally taught everyone to keep a good distance from his property line . The postal delivery truck did venture all the way to the teetering mailbox , and mail was regularly delivered through its yawning trap into the dark , corrugated steel tunnel . Outgoing letters , mostly bill payments , were collected , the addresses written in shaky black ink , as if little spider legs had grouped themselves into crooked letters . Such was the old man 's communication with the world . Twelve-year-old Gable Culligan Pace lived with his uncle in Vernon 's simple home cradled within a valley west of Virginia 's Blue Ridge , north of Roanoke County . Gabe had arrived in early spring , two and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads against spikes of sage green as Gabe whizzed by in the backseat of a social worker 's Ford Escort . Over the space of time and in the shadow of the mountains , Gabe came to appreciate , if not understand , many of Uncle Vernon 's habits . For instance , Vernon always kept a fan blowing , no matter the season . He preferred the fan to the cabinet full of smoker 's lung medicines . So when Gabe arrivedhome from school and saw his uncle 's electric fan lying on the wooden floor in the study , like a turtle that could n't right itself , Gabe dropped his backpack at the door . He held his breath and crossed the narrow hall . Vernon 's chair lay toppled to one side and Vernon himself lay motionless on the floor , flat on his back . Gabe had never really touched his uncle , though sometimes he had accidentally brushed Vernon 's rough hand while passing the margarine tub or clearing the table . Gabe stood by his uncle 's work boots and softly called his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leg amputated below the knee during his final tour in Vietnam , thirty-five years before . But with the latest prosthesis , Vernon walked with barely a limp . " The thing 's a chore to get on . Ca n't mau len , ca n't hurry it up no more , but ca n't stub my toe , neither ! " Gabe saw that the fake foot was n't angled quite right to the rest of his uncle 's body . That twist gave Gabe a little courage . He knelt and touched the plasticized ankle , then moved up , methodically pushing one finger against his uncle 's pant leg . He stopped at the thigh , rolled back on his heels , and looked at his uncle 's face . Gently he placed a finger on his uncle 's cheek . The skin was cold . Gabe fetched a thick plaid blanket and lay down with his uncle , covering them both . Gabe closed his eyes . Hours later , after dusk had swept the last particles of light from the room , Gabe awoke . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees on the floor , and cried . Messy crying , the kind of crying that leaves you swollen , red , and leaky . After a while , he snuffled his nose along his arm and sleeve and stared in the direction of the fan . He crawled toward it , fumbled for the switch , and turned it off . The absence of the low rumble startled him . And then he smiled . Gabe walked into the kitchen , flipped on the light , and fixed himself a peanut butter and honey sandwich . The first bite brought back the first words his uncle ever spoke to him . " You as skinny as a starved rat . Do n't you eat ? Come on , let 's eat somepin . What 'll it be ? " Vernon had scowled at Gabe 's silence . " Do n't tell me they 's foisting a dumb one on old Vernon . " When Ms. Rodriguez , the social worker , had nudged Gabe , he 'd whispered , " No , sir . " " No , no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight . I 'm no ' sir . ' They can save all they 's fancy sirs and salutin ' for the dress parade . No , life 's a jungle , there 's no use for sirs in the jungle . " Vernon motioned for Gabe to follow him to the kitchen . He laid out different foods on the counter and told Gabe to point to what he liked . Thus the first peanut butter and honey sandwich had been made and eaten under Vernon 's roof . Gabe now carefully cleaned the top of the bear-shaped honey bottle , the way his uncle had taught him . " Clean him right . He do n't want no scabby sores atop his head no more'n you do . " Then Gabe sat back down at the table and held on to the bear 's smooth , golden tummy . With night pressing its shadows against the windows , and the trees talking night talk , Gabe was not brave enough to go back into his uncle 's study . Every evening since he had left the bumpy , eastbound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , Gabe would always tell Vernon that he was going to bed . " G'night , Uncle Vernon . " " Good night , Gabe , " his uncle would always reply . Then Vernon would spoon out a ladleful of philosophy like , " Scum-lickin ' pus-suckin ' buckets of trouble ken happen whether you 're good or bad . But why git spit by skunk muck ? Stay low and steer clear of screw-ups , Gabe . " Tonight Gabe could n't bear not hearing his uncle 's voice . So he did n't go to bed . Instead , he dozed , on and off , his head on his arms at the kitchen table . In the morning , he changed his shirt and underpants , brushed his teeth , then stood a long time at his uncle 's study doorway . A fly settled on his uncle 's cheek and Gabe 's eyes widened in terror as the fly walked into his uncle 's nostril . Gabe wanted to scream and stamp and change everything there ever was . Maybe he should turn the fan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time and that 's why he kept the fan on-to make flies buzz off and hide that he 'd been dead for years . No , Gabe , that 's crazy thinking-he was n't dead till yesterday , just turn the fan on . Do it , do it ! Instead , Gabe shocked himself and did something that would later fill him with a shame as thick and fevered as blood . Something he could never undo . Gabe wrenched the fan 's cord from the socket , picked up the fan , and threw it down . Again and again . He almost tingled to see the wire frame crumple more and more with each crash . The plastic housing cracked , and pieces scattered across the room . He screamed at the fan and its bits running for cover under the desk and bookcase . " I hate you ! You 're not allowed to live no more ! I 'm killing you , you hear ? You 're dead . Dead ! Go away ! Go away ! " In his rage , Gabe did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied insect had made several loops in the air and sat preening its forelegs on the windowsill . Gabe dashed to the window , which normally sat open two inches all through the warm months and could n't be closed again till winter shrank its wood . The fly escaped just as Gabe , with a mighty , grunting heave , slammed shut the window . He stepped back , surprised at his strength , and looked at his shaking hands . Then he knelt at his uncle 's side , carefully tucking the blanket around the body and finally covering his uncle 's face and head . He closed the door to his uncle 's study , then grabbed his backpack and ran into the morning , off to his second day of sixth grade . by Audrey Shafer Excerpted by permission .
