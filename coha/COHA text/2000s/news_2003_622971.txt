<p> I have n't wasted anything in my kitchen since , say , 1986 , although there is some controversy in our household as to whether or not thrown away bones from someone else 's meat in a restaurant counts as wasting . <p> I do n't need any encouragement in this pursuit , even though a friend recently gave me a little out-of-print Indian cookbook called " Tasty Dishes From Waste Items , " by Aroona Reejhsinghani ( Jaico , 1973 ) . <p> Being a keeper of all things culinary , the little book about " tasty " food from waste items did , of course , catch my interest . Onion skins , citrus rinds , carrot tops , they 're all there , along with the bones and skin of poultry , the scraps from meat , the parings of vegetables . As I flicked through the pages I noticed shrimp shell curry , crispy pea shells , pumpkin peel raita , lime zest chutney , mixed peel fritters . I knew I was going to have fun with this . <p> And my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of vitamins many of the things we usually throw out are : the nourishment contained in peels , or of various leaves is high . Carrot tops for instance , spicy turnip or radish leaves , or especially one of my favorites - beet tops . <p> Here was a woman after my own heart . I might add that there are other ways I save ingredients , too : I stockpile , using my freezer . Duck legs are stashed into the freezer whenever I find them discounted ; I make confit when there are enough of them . Each time I roast a chicken I stash the raw neck , liver and giblets in separate bags in the freezer . The necks make a superb French and Jewish dish called , well , stuffed chicken neck . The livers make pate or chopped liver ; the giblets go into gravies and stocks or every so often , Cajun " dirty rice . " Even the fat from chickens and ducks gets saved in the freezer for duck fat , for schmaltz , that delicacy we 're not supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the way . In fact , my extravagance gets me into continual trouble , especially when I find myself in a tantalizing situation , say Harrods Food Halls , or Whole Foods or Berkeley Bowl , with a credit card burning a hole in my pocket . No , but there is a certain joy of frugality , making a whole pot of something delicious from a handful of things that would otherwise get thrown away , the creative challenge of rescuing a forgotten morsel and using it for kitchen inspiration . <p> I have been known to fling open friends ' refrigerators , and am not above going through my friends compost pails . " You 're not throwing this away , are you ? " <p> Several years ago when The Chronicle Food department published " The San Francisco Chronicle Cookbook , " edited by Michael Bauer and Fran Irwin ( Chronicle Books , 1997 ) , we all pitched in to cook our favorite dishes for the party . After it was over , I was aghast to see a huge pile of feathery fennel fronds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could n't bear the idea that they would be thrown away , all those lovely anise-y flavored fennel fronds . But what to do ? <p> The next day I was flying back to Britain . I did what I had to  --  piled the massive pile of leafy fennel into huge plastic bags and squeezed them into a suitcase . By the time I arrived at Heathrow , they were a little tired ( so was I ) , but those greens were ready to be made into soup , although the customs officer did murmur something about strange American traveling habits . <p> Broccoli stems , asparagus stems , fish heads , Parmesan rinds , a few slices of salami , two spoonfuls of yogurt , some cooked barley  --  these tiny dabs of this and that are , in fact , fun to experiment with . Instead of following the same old path of a traditional recipe with its tried and true ingredient list , I find myself thinking in an almost jazzlike way : following the flavors of what I have , in a fusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like splashing bright paints onto canvas , hoping for the utterly delicious . When ( and if ) it comes together , its provocative flavors stimulate diners to think as well as taste . <p> I once considered doing a TV show based on my showing up on the doorstep of various people 's houses  --  unannounced , of course  --  and going through their refrigerator , cupboards and , yes , their compost bin , and making a meal . However , this nifty little idea got no takers , I 'm sad to say . <p> Meanwhile , I realize that I 'm not the only one out there with these tendencies . When I was having Sunday lunch recently at some friends ' home in the comfortable Hampstead section of London , there was a knock at the door ; it was the neighbor couple with their container of compost . <p> " Our neighbors bring it to us before they consign it to their garden , " our friends explained as they opened the door . " They 've been doing it ever since they found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked through the pile of vegetable discards , they pulled out a few choice specimens , and exclaimed with a smile of delight , " You 'd be amazed at the things they throw away . " I could n't have said it better myself . <p> HOW TO MAKE MAGIC WITH DIBS AND DABS <p> Before you clean out the fridge and toss those faded vegetables , scraps of cheese , dabs of marmalade and ghosts of meals past , think about how you could use them to brighten or enrich today 's fare . Following are a few ideas . One word of caution : Use only those foods that are still edible ; toss anything that 's beyond recall . <p>  --  Wilted arugula . If you have a big bunch of arugula that is too wilted for salad , think pasta . Chop the arugula into bite-size pieces and toss at the last minute into a garlicky tomato sauce . Eat on al dente pasta , sprinkled with a little freshly grated Parmesan , pecorino , Asiago or Dry Jack . <p>  --  Asparagus stems . Chop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the liquid and use it to make asparagus risotto ( add a few asparagus tips to the risotto right at the end ) or puree the stems and make soup . If the puree is too coarse , put it through a sieve for a smoother texture . <p>  --  Beet greens . Cook as you would chard , then drain and eat as a salad , dressed with lashings of extra virgin olive oil , a squirt of tangy lemon and a few olives on the side . <p>  --  Stale bread . This is a real treasure ! When bread is only a little stale , decide on what you 'd like  --  croutons , crostini , chunks for salad  --  then slice accordingly . If you 've not cut it ahead of time , and it has reached a cement-like hardness , simply break it into a couple of pieces ( if you can ) , soak it in water , and when it has softened , squeeze dry and dress for a summery bread salad Italian-style . <p> You ca n't make good bread pudding without stale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raisin bread . And shortly before Thanksgiving I start saving bits of different types of bread as it goes stale so that my holiday stuffing will be rich and varied . <p>  --  Fennel fronds . Those lacy leaves from the top of fennel bulbs have a marvelous licorice-y flavor . Add to fish stock , spaghetti sauce , meatballs , Mediterranean salads , tomato-y Provencal-type vegetable soups . And you ca n't make Sicilian pasta and sardines without them . <p>  --  Green onion tops . Some people actually throw these away ! It does n't bear thinking about . Chop and use to flavor salads , soups , grilled cheese sandwiches , scrambled eggs , almost anything . <p>  --  The last dab of mustard or jam . Pour a little vinegar into the jar and swish around , then incorporate it into a vinaigrette . A little cranberry sauce , blackberry preserve , or tarragon mustard can give a delicious lift to a simple vinaigrette . <p>  --  Parmesan cheese rinds . Add a big rind or two to a simmering risotto when you first start adding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flavor , and if it 's softened enough by the time the risotto is ready , you can nibble on it in the kitchen before you serve dinner . Add a rind or two to a pot of simmering minestrone for extra depth of flavor and richness . <p>  --  Potato peels . These ordinarily tossed-out treasures can be made into an addictive snack : garlic-roasted potato peels . Wash potatoes and scrub the skins well . Peel them with a paring knife , leaving a bit of potato on the skin ; you 're going to be eating them , after all . Dry the skins in a towel , then toss in extra virgin olive oil and arrange in a single layer on a baking sheet . Scatter a few whole unpeeled garlic cloves around the pan if you like . Roast the potato skins at 350 degrees-400 degrees for about 30 minutes , longer if necessary , until the skins are crisply brown and crunchy . <p> Meanwhile , chop a couple of raw garlic cloves and a little fresh rosemary . If you have no rosemary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the oven , toss them with the chopped garlic mixture and sprinkle with coarse salt or flaked sea salt . Eat hot and crispy . <p>  --  Leftover rice from Chinese take-out the night before . Make rice pudding , stir-fried rice , add to egg-lemon soup to make it thick and creamy , add to ground meat for filling cabbage leaves or vine leaves , or incorporate it into a meat loaf . <p>  --  Stale corn tortillas . Make into chilaquiles , the most delicious , comforting Mexican dish I can think of ( and a fabulous breakfast served with a poached or fried egg alongside ) . Cut the stale tortillas into strips and fry until crisp . Transfer to paper towels to drain . Combine with simmering chicken broth seasoned with tomatillo salsa or a mild red chile sauce . Top with lots of shredded mild white cheese such as Jack , and bake until the cheese melts and sizzles . Sauteed chorizo may be added too , and/or a little chopped garlic . Serve with chopped raw onion . <p>  --  Leftover raw vegetables . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd like to use but ca n't figure out what to combine them in , make a light batter and fry up a fritto misto di giardino , or a platter of mixed fried vegetables , Italian style . Herbs such as sage leaves , or cheese cubes are delicious added to the mix ( feta is particularly wonderful ) . <p>  --  Leftover cooked vegetables . Puree leftover winter vegetables such as carrots , potatoes , turnips ; add a little chopped sauteed shallot or onion , then warm it all through with several cups of broth . Season to taste , stir in a little cream and eat hot on a cold night , sprinkled with chopped chives or green onion tops . <p>  --  Leftover barbecued or roasted Mediterranean vegetables . Coarsely chop the vegetables  --  peppers , eggplant , zucchini  --  and toss with al dente pasta , or turn them into a spicy next-day salsa . <p>  --  Leftover wine . The remains of last night 's red can be simmered up into a rich red wine sauce or added to a simmering stew of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red can be the basis of sauces , splashed into a skillet to deglaze , used as the basis for a barbecue marinade , or to poach fruit such as pears or peaches . Tightly-corked wine lasts well for about a week in the refrigerator , and gives that je ne sais quoi to your cooking . <p> Marlena Spieler 's latest books are " Jewish Heritage Cookbook " and the vegetable book in the Williams-Sonoma series .
