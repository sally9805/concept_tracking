EVELYN ANN THOMPSON what if i 'm your first ? non-stepper , i mean . then what ?

ADAM SORENSON nah. that 's too you know . that 's a total hassle , you end up rolling around on the ground , you 'd probably sue the place , or me , and then i 'd get fired for doing my job . screw that ( beat ) could you do that for me , though ? p. 4 EVELYN ANN THOMPSON which , roll around on the ground or sue you ? ADAM SORENSON no , step back behind the line there i 'd appreciate it . EVELYN ANN THOMPSON not really . ADAM SORENSON no , seriously , i would . i 'd definitely appreciate it EVELYN ANN THOMPSON i mean , not really i 'm not going to ADAM SORENSON i thought you just said you probably will EVELYN ANN THOMPSON yeah , probably. i decided not to . ADAM SORENSON hey , you 're not gon na mess up my weekend with this , are you ? EVELYN ANN THOMPSON i was n't planning on it , but i 'm not completely against it , either . ADAM SORENSON see , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a report and stuff , i 'm here till six , six-thirty easy , and i have a second job to get to . EVELYN ANN THOMPSON tonight ? friday night ? ADAM SORENSON yep . right after this , at the video store EVELYN ANN THOMPSON why would anyone work two jobs on friday night ? p. 5 ADAM SORENSON for money . EVELYN ANN THOMPSON of course sorry .

ADAM SORENSON yeah . EVELYN ANN THOMPSON no , sorry , i can't. p. 6 ADAM SORENSON why is that ? ( pointing ) it 's a pretty good-sized sculpture . you can see it just fine from there EVELYN ANN THOMPSON truthfully ? i 'm building up my nerve , and if i go back over , i 'll probably be a big wuss about it and take off ADAM SORENSON about what ? the wuss part , i mean EVELYN ANN THOMPSON i was going to deface the statue . ADAM SORENSON oh . oh ( pointing ) is that paint ? EVELYN ANN THOMPSON yes . ADAM SORENSON great from across the room , i thought you were maybe one of the cleaning people , i was hoping that was lemon pledge or something they share a smile.paint 's not really a great thing to have in a museum . people 'll definitely take that the wrong way EVELYN ANN THOMPSON how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SORENSON i 'm thinking outside would be the general direction they 'd steer you with spray paint why do you have that ? EVELYN ANN THOMPSON i was going to do something to the nude . mess it up or p. 7 ADAM SORENSON what , you mean , like , colour it or something ? EVELYN ANN THOMPSON i was thinking more of painting a big dick on it , but whatever ADAM SORENSON well , you could still colour it in the dick . evelyn smiles at this . EVELYN ANN THOMPSON true . it might look kinda weird ADAM SORENSON oh , i think a graffiti penis is gon na be plenty odd already ( beat ) so , right over the leaves there , or just a free-floating number ? EVELYN ANN THOMPSON probably anatomically correct . i mean , if you 're gon na do it , why not ADAM SORENSON do it right ? absolutely . and , would why be completely out of the question here ? EVELYN ANN THOMPSON why the dick ? ADAM SORENSON uh-huh . i mean , since i basically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , it 'd help with my report EVELYN ANN THOMPSON because i do n't like art that is n't true . ADAM SORENSON true. what do you mean ? p. 8 EVELYN ANN THOMPSON false art . i hate it other patrons drift past . they watch them go . ADAM SORENSON no , i understand the words you 've used there , although they 're both pretty subjective : art. truth. EVELYN ANN THOMPSON exactly ! that 's the beauty of art it 's subjective . ADAM SORENSON right , but see , i do n't know what you 're referring to then . i mean , specifically ( beat ) did n't oscar wilde say something like , in art there is no such thing as a universal truth or whatever ? EVELYN ANN THOMPSON yes very good . a truth in art is that whose contradictory is also true. right , but that 's an aesthetic . i 'm talking about practicalities . censorship . ( she points. ) this sculpture . it 's fake , it 's not real . therefore , false art ADAM SORENSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i read the little thingie there one time EVELYN ANN THOMPSON yes , but the leaf cluster is n't . ADAM SORENSON it 's not ? / what is it , a pastie or something , like strippers have ? p. 9 EVELYN ANN THOMPSON no. / it 's plaster it was added by a committee who had complaints from local townspeople . / uh-huh . / they made a petition and got that put on , thereby removing its subjectivity as art . ADAM SORENSON really ? / i did n't know that / when did they do this ? EVELYN ANN THOMPSON seven or eight years ago now , i think . before i got here , anyway . / see , they objected to his thing. the shape of it . said it was too life-like. ( beat ) it 's supposed to be god , you know that 's what pisses ' em off . ADAM SORENSON huh . / yeah he 's not really supposed to have one of those , is he ? EVELYN ANN THOMPSON no , and i do n't know why we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it , you can see the see right behind the grapes there , you can just see his ADAM SORENSON grapes . yes . you 're absolutely , huh . did n't even cover him properly . shoddy craftsmanship ! EVELYN ANN THOMPSON i mean , if you 're gon na do it , at least ADAM SORENSON exactly . do it right . ( beat ) but why deface the thing ? i mean , just out of curiosity . why not , say , knock the plaster off and expose his you know cluster if you 're trying to p. 10 EVELYN ANN THOMPSON because . that 's so expected . ADAM SORENSON ahh so , you 're a student , then , or is this just basic anarchy ? EVELYN ANN THOMPSON yep . student . ADAM SORENSON me too . EVELYN ANN THOMPSON yeah ? what 's your emphasis ?

EVELYN ANN THOMPSON it 's totally the point how about you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it get you hot ? PHILLIP this is , like , uncalled for , okay ? all she said was EVELYN ANN THOMPSON i know what she said , why do n't you let her speak ? ( to jenny ) did you wan na say anything else ? huh ? okay , then all i 'm saying is that , in my opinion , it was n't pornography , it was a statement . of course , that 's the beauty of statements , like art , they 're subjective . you and i can think completely different things and we can both be right unless , and this seems quite probable , you just ca n't stand to lose an argument . quiet for a moment from the group . p. 29 PHILLIP wow . the postgraduate mind at work ADAM SORENSON i 'll help you get dessert , jenny , if you want to JENNY i still do n't think that makes it a statement . it 's graffiti EVELYN ANN THOMPSON what do you mean , it would be a huge statement especially for a town like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a town like this , so maybe you should watch it .

ADAM SORENSON no , i would n't exactly use his name and sweet in the same short story JENNY and that 's what 's bugging me . ADAM SORENSON why , though ? maybe he 's just JENNY i 've only seen him like this once before , maybe twice . definitely once , when we were first going out and he was seeing somebody else , too . it was over , mostly , but he was still seeing her . remember that ? p. 42 ADAM SORENSON yeah . i do . the other one . JENNY the other jenny , exactly . i 'd call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment if he answered and i said , hey , it 's jenny. he did n't know what to do , so he 'd get all sort of sweet and fish around slowly until he figured out if it was her or me god , i used to hate that ! ADAM SORENSON so , do you know anyone else named jenny right now ? JENNY no , i do n't mean that , not the name so much as the feeling that sense that there 's someone else .

JENNY really ? ADAM SORENSON i think so i mean , that 's a lousy thing to pass on to a person , and if i did , you know , know something and then told you , you 'd more likely hate me for ever than be grateful JENNY yeah , that 's probably true ADAM SORENSON ummm , you could lie , you know , feel free . JENNY no , you 're probably right ADAM SORENSON so , that does n't exactly make me want to come clean here - which i do n't have anything to come clean about , okay , honestly , i just mean , whatever - but i feel i would . i do , because i think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you 're almost married so why should n't it be ? the truth , i mean .
