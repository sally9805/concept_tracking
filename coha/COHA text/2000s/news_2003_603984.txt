<p> Remember your first Valentine ? The girl who sat next to you in first grade with the most beautiful smile ? The boy in fifth grade who stole a kiss from you , but the truth is you happily gave it away ? <p> We all had first loves , whether they were in grade school or junior high or later . They 're the ones we never forget , even though our lives went on without them . <p> To mark the day of hearts and flowers , USA TODAY staff members recall their first valentines , then try to track them down to see whether the feeling was , well , mutual . Our stories continue on 2D and 3D . <p> Seat chart spells love <p> She was a Y. I was a W. <p> How much closer can you get ? <p> Year after year , Patty Yaxley sat directly behind me in grade school . Last row over , last two desks . I spent most of my time turning around to stare at her , something Mrs. Bane , our second-grade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I not ? She had perfect bangs and perfect braids , and a throaty laugh that could , and did , make my heart sing . I spent hours on end doing foolish things to amuse her , just so I could hear it . <p> But when she invited me to her birthday party and gave out coloring books and crayons to her guests , I knew then I would marry her . What a catch ! No other girl I had met had such class . <p> Patty is now a nurse 's aide in western New York , married for 36 years , mother of five , grandmother of two . When I saw her in September for the first time in 40 years , we agreed we had something special going . <p> " I remember ( fellow classmate ) Rick Zapf saying I was ruining you " with all the attention , she said . " He was quite perturbed with me . " <p>  --  Craig Wilson <p> Hyattsville 's Kissing Bandit <p> When I was in second grade at Ridgecrest Elementary in Hyattsville , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls in Mrs. Johnson 's class outnumbered the boys , of course , but I was determined that he would be mine . <p> He had curly hair and the cutest little dimples , and if memory serves me correctly , a cute mole on his face . I could n't wait to go to school every day so I could see him and write love notes to him and doodle his name intertwined with mine . <p> One day , I walked right over and planted a kiss on his cheek ! Did he like it ? I do n't know . He smiled , so maybe he did . <p> Mrs. Johnson did not like it , however . " Charlene ! " she said . " Return to your seat immediately ! " <p> She called my parents and sent a note home saying I was a very good student but easily distracted . <p> It was worth the spanking , and I would kiss him again  --  except that I 'm now married to my true love . I have no doubt Talmadge found his true love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find , and not one replied . I 'm sure he 's out there , smiling just as he did when I kissed him . <p>  --  Charlene Daniels Washington <p> Dear Diary : Met a guy today <p> I was a sweet-16 tomboy who had never been seriously kissed and so had little to confess to the little blue diary I scrawled in daily . <p> " I got up early to set my hair . It turned out OK . " <p> Entries changed after I met Jack Lauroesch , a sunny 17-year-old jock . We had never talked until that fateful school fire drill in 1966 . <p> Our eyes met in a way I had only read about in romance novels . <p> Even though it was the swinging ' 60s , our courtship was ' 50s cute . Tennis . Teasing . Flirting , then furtive smooching . Curfews . <p> My diary entries grew longer . " He ( jokingly ) asked me to marry him . Then he seriously asked me to the Senior Prom ( twice ) . I said we 'd probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . " <p> He was right . We went to the prom , dated in college , then broke up . He went to Vietnam . We reunited only to split again . <p> I called Jack , now an investment counselor , breaking that old high school rule : Never phone a boy first . " Do you remember how we met ? " <p> A nervous laugh . " Precisely ? Probably no . But I do remember when you were at my house and my father said I could take you home in the Corvair . You were on my first drive in the Corvair . " <p> First drive , first love . Both are sometimes bumpy , but ours was a great ride . <p>  --  Kitty Bean Yancey <p> Catching up with Scott <p> His hair was as yellow as a chick , his eyes as blue as Crest gel toothpaste . He was just about the fastest kid at Bradley Hills Elementary in suburban Bethesda , Md . No wonder , then , that I never could catch Scott Hutchinson , my first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth , fifth and sixth grades simply staring at Scott . I swooned when he returned from a spring break ski trip out West with a deeply tanned face . I secretly looked forward to square-dancing class in hopes of having him promenade me at least once . I teasingly called him " Douglas " ( Scott is his middle name ) , a flirting method akin to little boys pinching girls . <p> In high school , we actually became pretty good friends . So it took just one call to a mutual friend to track down his cellphone number . <p> As I explained the reason for stalking him yet again , he sounded sort of giddy . Scott remembered my grade-school crush , but only because I confessed in high school . I reminded him about the " Douglas " thing : " That drove me nuts . " <p> Scott now lives in Denver and told me he 's transitioning from a life of bartending , golfing and skiing to one of studying ; he 's applying to doctoral programs in psychology . He 's single . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Just a little bit , " he said , laughing . " But in a good way . " <p>  --  Olivia Barker <p> Forget me not ? Nope <p> At first I did n't think I had a first crush . Yeah , yeah , yeah , there was Paul McCartney and that cold night in February with just me , him and Ed Sullivan , but that does n't really count . <p> But through some hazy mental fog induced by too many childhood rounds of Strawberry Quik and games of Candyland , his first name came to me . Kevin . Freckles , curly hair . The essence of cute boyness . At least to someone whose whole universe was a new Tonawanda , N.Y. , subdivision . <p> My infatuation did n't last much longer than kindergarten . Probably because of our communication problems . We never talked . <p> I could n't summon his last name until a couple of days ago . Lowes . Perhaps he later launched a chain of hardware stores . <p> Nope . Almost as impressive , he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Internet and a few awkward calls to his very nice wife , Barbara , I tracked him down . <p> I was relieved to hear his genial laughter . He recalled no untoward amorous behavior on my part . Actually , he could n't recall me at all , though we lived on the same street through high school . However , he did remember that the lone bathroom in our little schoolhouse had a red and green light on the door to control traffic . <p> Darn . I knew I should have worn my red-and-green outfit more that year . <p>  --  Susan Wloszczyna <p> Daredevil fell ( 8 feet ) in love <p> I was 6 years old when I literally gave my left arm for love . <p> Susan was a cute , blue-eyed blonde who lived next door in Manassas Park , Va . I never knew her last name ; such things are irrelevant to a lovesick boy . <p> She was a tomboy and relished in games of cowboys and Indians . I returned the favor by playing " house . " We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chain-link fence that separated our yards . But there was one thing missing  --  our first kiss . <p> On a hot day in 1977 , I came up with a foolhardy plan to win Susan 's heart : I would become a daredevil like Evel Knievel . <p> So I climbed to the top of our backyard swing set and stood on the handrails at the top of the slide , 8 feet above the ground . My plan was to dive off , land on my hands and finish with a back handspring . Next door , Susan and her sister , Frieda , cheered me on from their plastic wading pool . <p> In flight , I heard what sounded like the crack of a baseball bat . Perplexed , I stared in disbelief  --  my left arm was shaped like a " Z. " <p> Susan was the first person to sign my cast . A few months later , Susan kissed me , and my mom caught the moment on Polaroid . <p> But after I went off to Catholic school , I spent less time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch altogether . <p> To this day , my left arm is slightly crooked , a permanent reminder of my first love . <p>  --  Cesar G. Soriano <p> Girl meets girl , and likes it <p> My first romance happened in kindergarten when Andrew Rothstein planted three kisses on my cheek . What can I say ? I was fast . But it was n't until many years later that I fell in love . <p> On a sunny day at Berkeley , Jon walks up and puts his hand on my arm . " That woman you were with at the market , " he smiles  --  he had seen me with Cynthia . He must have seen how our hands , our arms , our faces moved together as we picked out hot peppers and Asian eggplant . " Is she your lover ? " <p> " Not yet , " I whisper , shocking myself . I feel flushed and this little wave of ecstasy passes through me . It is the first time I 've acknowledged to anyone , including myself , how I feel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this will happen . <p> When we finally spoke again , her voice had grown richer , but she had the same rolling laugh . My biggest fear was that she 'd say " Janet who ? " She did n't . <p> Today , Cynthia is an attorney in Southern California , with a husband , three children and dogs . It turns out we share fond memories of our relationship . <p> " That 's not the direction my life took , but I 'm not ashamed of it , " she told me . <p>  --  Janet Kornblum <p> I remember Bonnie , but not her last name <p> The sad part about my " first crush " is that I do n't remember Bonnie 's last name . After all , we were just 7 at the time . She was one of my classmates in second grade at Lincoln Elementary in Toledo . That was back in 1943 . <p> Bonnie was a cute blonde ( are n't they all ? ) who sat across the aisle from me . She was a bright , alert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bonnie always kept an assortment of the very best pens , pencils , erasers and crayons in her desk . I was the only person in the class who could use them . I remember that on one of the larger erasers she wrote " only Larry . " <p> World War II was going on , and we co-chaired the " Buy Savings Bonds " campaign in our class . <p> I knew Bonnie for less than two years , because in 1944 our family moved to Florida . I never saw or heard from her again . <p> If dear Bonnie is still with us , she would be in her mid-60s  --  and probably still a blonde . <p>  --  Larry Webb <p> A long way to go , but feelings were worth the trip <p> My seventh-grade love was a long-distance affair . <p> Roxy Moeller lived in a neighboring town , Bryant , S.D. , 12 miles from Lake Norden . She had short blond hair , blue eyes , glasses and a soft voice that made me quiver . <p> We wrote letters , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would read it several times on my way to school . <p> Roxy and I saw each other at basketball games . I played and she was a cheerleader wearing black and white . One time , I took the ball out of bounds near her cheering section , and I heard her friends say , " Roxy , there he is , " amid giggles and my red face . <p> My heart used to pound when she walked toward me . I was so nervous , I could barely say hello . Funny , but when I contacted her in Madison , S.D. , she thought she was the shy one . <p> Roxy has been married for 22 years and finishes houses for a construction company . <p> I did n't remember how we started , but Roxy did : " You came up to me and said , ' Write me sometime . ' But it was difficult to keep it going long distance , given neither of us were old enough to drive . " <p> And basketball season ending did n't help , either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> My first real crush happened one summer when I was in junior high . My family used to vacation with friends on Lake Lyndon B. Johnson in Marble Falls , Texas . The adults would all hang out together while the kids ran around in packs , swimming , water-skiing , boating . <p> My girlfriends and I discovered a neat way to meet boys . We would sail our Sunfish out to the middle of the lake , purposely tip the boat over and wait to be rescued when they drove by in their motorboats . It worked every time . <p> For the life of me , I ca n't remember his name . But I do remember the wind dying down and paddling home after he left in his boat . I was madly in love . At the end of vacation , we said goodbye standing in the gravel driveway of the lake house . <p> Afterward , I cried on my father 's shoulder and asked him why we could n't take my boyfriend home with us . My father never tired of telling that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pesce <p> Butch made her forget preppies <p> By the time I was 16 in 1970 , I 'd gone through a whole pet shop full of puppy loves . The boys I knew in Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , were preppies , or surfers who looked like the cutest brother from the Beach Boys . Even my steadies ' names sounded cuddly : Randy . Terry . Artie . Tommy . <p> And then I met Butch . He had long blond hair and a motorcycle . My mother hated him . Naturally , I was crazy about him . <p> I was a good girl , serious about school and grades . He was a bad boy , a high school dropout . It was Gidget meets The Wild One . <p> The ride was fast and fun while it lasted , which was n't long . I think he cheated with my best friend . <p> I would have asked him if he remembered it the same way if I could have found him . Someone I knew had a 15-year-old phone number someplace in South Carolina . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the area with Butch 's last name . No luck . <p> I would have been disappointed if he had settled down and become a CPA . It would have been even worse if he had wound up like another of my flings , who panhandled me for beer money in front of the 7-Eleven years later . <p> I met a few more bad boys along the way , none as memorable as the dangerous Butch . Even so , when it came time to marry , I chose a suitor with a sweet-sounding name . Kerry has short dark hair and a sensible car . My mother adores him . Naturally , I 'm crazy about him , too . <p>  --  Deborah Sharp <p> Best friends were rivals for her young heart <p> Paul Bernardoni and Ralph Santoro were my first loves . They were close friends ; we were all in the same fifth-grade class . <p> Paul was cute and blond , and his father was principal of the fancy new grammar school in Hamden , Conn . On Sunday nights , when his dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we could play basketball and walk the halls . . . alone . At home , I was secretly still playing with Barbies , but on Sunday nights , I had what I thought to be romance . <p> Paul reminds me that I broke up with him because I said I wanted to be unattached once I got to junior high . <p> But first there was Ralph . When I think of him , I think of the ring . It was a huge men 's initial ring with a black stone . I proudly wore it around my neck to school until my mother saw it and made me give it back . <p> I remember my disappointment when my brother zeroed in on Ralph in a class picture . " That 's your boyfriend ? His clothes do n't even match ! " I 'd have to move on . <p> Ralph does n't recall the ring , but " I remember my first kiss with you . " He says it was around Valentine 's Day . <p> Shortly before our first conversation in 25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University and a guitarist in a rock ' n ' roll band  --  looked up our high school class on Classmates.com . " My eyes just went to your name , " he says . <p> These days , Paul is sales manager at a Toyota dealership in Westerly , R.I. A week before I called , he was telling his boss how he lost his grammar-school girlfriend to a buddy who actually got to kiss her . <p>  --  Jayne O'Donnell <p> Moving dashed a boy 's hopes <p> I called somebody 's grandmother the other day and told her I was deeply in love with her . Thirty-three years ago , when she was 12 . <p> Lilon Quist was one year behind me in our tiny middle school in the rural western Connecticut town of Washington Depot . She was a cute blond cheerleader and a new pal 's cousin . I was the new kid  --  and , our yearbook reminds me , chess club member , soccer scrub and a " class clown . " Quite a lure . Other than my squeaky " hello " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke . " Next year , " I told myself . <p> But there would be no next year ; that summer my family packed up and returned to Philadelphia . I never saw Lilon or that town again . She , apparently , was unmoved by my departure . With the aid of the Internet I found her , and she gently admitted that she does n't remember me . Still in western Connecticut , she 's the happily married mother of five , grandmother of one . Still athletic , she 's training to become an Outward Bound-type youth counselor . And back then , she had a crush on Mr. Werkhoven , our science teacher , who still teaches at our old school . <p> But , hey , I have a wonderful wife and two great kids . Maybe I played my first " relationship " just right . <p>  --  John Bacon
