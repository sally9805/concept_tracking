David Dunn , the agent for unlikely starting quarterback Kyle Orton of the Bears , knew he had a different kind of kid on his hands when , on their first flight together , the rookie quarterback pulled out a book : The Greatest Generation by Tom Brokaw . " I read every chance I get , though I have n't had many chances lately , " Orton said Sunday in a happy Chicago locker room . " I like Brokaw . I like his perspective on things . He 's a Midwestern guy , like me. " // The fact that Orton is a corn-fed Iowan who started 35 games at Purdue makes him a good fit for the Bears . A Midwestern kid quarterbacking the Midwest 's team . It helps that Orton just might be able to play . Forced into a starting role when incumbent Rex Grossman broke his left ankle on Aug. 12 and backup Chad Hutchinson proved ineffective in the preseason , Orton has taken the reins with the unflappability of Tom Brady . // The seventh quarterback picked in April , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the first rookie QB to start opening day for the Bears since Zeke Bratkowski in 1954 ) . Despite an above-average NFL arm , he fell to the fourth round thanks to a plodding 5.14-second time in the 40 at the scouting combine . But the Bears are n't relying on his feet . With a formidable defense that has allowed but 15 points in eight quarters , the Bears need Orton , more than anything , to be efficient . And in their 38-6 rout of the Lions at Soldier Field last Sunday , that 's precisely what he was : 14 of 21 , 150 yards , one touchdown , no interceptions , a 103.3 rating and a couple of smart audibles. // Orton arrived at training camp fourth in the quarterback pecking order , behind veterans Grossman , Hutchinson and Kurt Kittner , meaning he spent no time throwing to the first-stringers . He did n't get the starting job until the final preseason game , which left him playing catch-up in many ways -- some as simple as finding out how star wideout Muhsin Muhammad likes to catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the proper attitude to take in a huddle full of veterans . " He was smart and respectful , the right presence , " says guard Ruben Brown . " However he was taught in college was obviously right , because he did n't come in with too much ego . " // But perhaps the most important lesson Orton has learned in two weeks of on-the-job training is to avoid mistakes . " There 's a fine line between a play working and not working , " he says . In Week 1 at Washington the Bears were trailing 9-7 late in the third quarter , at the Redskins ' 22 , when Orton tried to fire a laser to Muhammad in the end zone . The ball was intercepted , and the Bears never had as good a scoring opportunity again , losing 9-7 . " Getting three points is real important down there , " quarterbacks coach Wade Wilson told Orton when he came off the field , and the rookie resolved not to take a chance like that , in such a tight spot , again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led 17-6 with 1:20 left in the second quarter and were looking to break the game open before the half . On first down from the Detroit 28 , the call was for Muhammad to run a post pattern from his split-right spot as Orton 's first option . At the line the rookie saw Lions safeties Kenoy Kennedy and Terrence Holt on either side of the field in a two-deep zone . Orton 's job , at the snap , was to stare down the left side to try to draw Holt over to that side of the field . Holt bit , and Orton saw Muhammad get his shoulder inside cornerback Fernando Bryant and take him upfield toward the post . Standing at the 34 , the rookie fired a spiral with a little air under it toward the goal line . Perfect throw , right in stride to Muhammad , who was shielding Bryant from the ball . Touchdown , Bears --  Orton 's first . // Four afternoons a week , a half hour before practice begins , Muhammad , a 10-year veteran , and Orton cut short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys just go out and play , " Muhammad said on Sunday . " Some guys know the game . Kyle 's one of those guys who knows the game . " // It 's far too early to predict Orton 's future , given the Bears ' strange history at quarterback . From 2002 through ' 04 eight QBs started at least a game for Chicago : Jim Miller , Chris Chandler , Henry Burris , Kordell Stewart , Grossman , Jonathan Quinn , Craig Krenzel and Hutchinson . None of those eight are on the team 's 53-man roster today . No wonder : Their combined three-year record was 16-32 . Orton has a better arm than anyone in that bunch and is bright enough to master the offense . But this is Chicago : NFL Quarterback Wasteland . We just have n't seen enough of Orton to know if Sunday 's game is a real beginning or fool 's gold . // " You can feel this city is hungry for a winning quarterback , a winning team , " says Orton . " I hope I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of work to do . I have n't done anything yet . " // SI.com/football
