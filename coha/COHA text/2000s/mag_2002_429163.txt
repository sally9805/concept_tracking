Ask and you shall receive IT SHOULD N'T SURPRISE ANYONE THAT THERE IS A PRIEST shortage now that we are in an era where approximately 60 percent of American Catholics do not believe in the Real Presence in the Eucharist ( December Sounding Board , " Do n't give the priest shortage the silent treatment , " by Father James E. Sullivan ) . It should n't surprise anyone that most of these same Catholics would believe the best remedy for the shortage is opening the priesthood to women and/or those who are married . I doubt a lot of Catholics in this country understand the biblical teaching on the issue ( it certainly was n't in the article ) , let alone articulate the church 's teachings why we have a male , celibate priesthood . The first remedy for the shortage of priests should be turning to prayer , especially in front of the Blessed Sacrament . Dioceses that are experiencing a need for priests should start an organized prayer effort for the provision of priests and religious . Before we start telling Jesus and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholics should be mindful that we are trying to understand and conform to the teachings of Jesus in our lives . Jennifer Quesinberry Everett , Wash . Congratulations for having the courage to speak out in print about the conspiracy of silence regarding the priest shortage . Yes , we badly need some bishops with , among other things , the courage to speak out and do something about it , but we laypeople too have not only the right to speak out about what we need from the hierarchy , but also the obligation to do so . We the laity are as much , or even more , guilty of the crippling silence ( sitting in the pews expecting someone else , the hierarchy , to solve the problem for us ) . We are church , and we need to do something to fix our church . John Chuchman Scottsdale , Ariz . I disagree with Sullivan 's article . A married clergy will not solve the vocation crisis . As near as I can tell , the fuss and todo over married clergy and women clergy have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but since then . A married clergy would require Catholics to do some heavy rethinking-like , who is going to decide the salary of married priests ? Catholics are considered poor contributors to their church . Would Catholics be willing to give 10 percent of their salary up front , as do the Mormons ? Suppose the bishops did authorize a married clergy and then published a letter telling how much each Catholic should give to support and maintain the priest and his family . What do you think the reaction of the faithful would be ? Paul R. Bedard Stony Point , N.Y . While I applaud Sullivan 's questioning of priestly celibacy , I wondered , as I read his article , why there was no mention of ordaining women . If the church ordained women , there would be no shortage of priests . Name withheld Chicago , Ill . Flying the flag I read Meinrad Scherer-Emunds ' December Editors ' Note ( " Does peace have a prayer ? " ) . For him to pull down the flag outside his home because he disagrees with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very least , hypocritical . To take his flag down is not just a sign of disagreement with the government , it is also a withdrawal of his support for the women and men who have the courage to serve their country and who willingly face death to defend all of our freedoms , including his . // Why not proudly fly the flag to support the good things the American government does ? Why not fly it to show support for the humanitarian relief for which our government spends billions of dollars ? Why not fly it in support of his freedom of speech and his freedom of religion ? No . When the going gets tough , instead of advocating for change through the free press while also supporting those in the trenches by flying the symbol of their homeland , Scherer-Emunds pulls that symbol down . The soldiers fighting in Afghanistan need our prayers , but they also need our simple moral support . David B. Noller Traverse City , Mich . I am horrified at Scherer-Emunds ' antiAmerican editorial-and ashamed . More people died in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unconscionable ? Does he think no response or saying , " be peaceful " will do the trick and save our people from terrorists ? Death of innocents occurs in war , but more people die when you have no protection . Go ahead , sit on your golden better-than-thou pillar while our good soldiers make sure you do n't lose your freedom to print trash . You make me ashamed to admit I am a Catholic . Our flag will fly always . K. Himmel Port Huron , Mich . I found Scherer-Emunds ' denunciation of the action against terrorism in Afghanistan by the American and British  --  led coalition to be extremely disappointing . Evil exists and must be confronted . As someone who spent years opposing American military action in Vietnam , I find his point of view naive and counterproductive , even self-righteous . Does Scherer-Emunds really believe that love could have worked against Adolf Hitler ? Fat chance . What would he have done about Auschwitz ? Held a love-in ? We were attacked . President Bush 's response was measured , not hasty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Osama bin Laden is a mass murderer being harbored by the Taliban . Unfortunately , it is not enough to hate evil ; one has to destroy it . Or else it will destroy you . Richard Cummings Bridgehampton , N. Y. Welcome reminder I was moved and inspired by Pattiann Rogers ' essay " Sympathy for the Creator " ( December ) . In my college philosophy class I struggled with the " argument from evil " against the existence of God : How can a good , omniscient , omnipotent God allow evil ? I decided the only way God could exist is if God is responsible for good , and if humankind , through free will , is responsible for evil . The profound corollary to that is that God is a victim of our free will . The evil that we do to one another must cause as much anguish to God as my children cause me when they bully or hurt each other . This realization profoundly changed my relationship to God many years ago-a moment that I relived as I read Rogers ' article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colo . Risky business I read December 's The Examined Life ( " Go global " by Tom McGrath ) , and it 's a risky stance to take these days to even question unadulterated patriotism , but I really liked the way McGrath put it . My husband and I have found ourselves mildly uncomfortable with all the flag waving . It 's not that we do n't feel there has been a grievous offense to the U.S. , but it 's not just against the U.S. To my mind all civilization was attacked on September 11 . We considered putting out our U.S. flag but it did n't quite feel like enough . We talked about putting out our Earth flag , but wondered whether it would be misinterpreted as being not patriotic enough . Then we realized our son had the flag at his dorm , so we could n't do it anyway . I 've got a few of those Earth stickers , and they remind me that although I love my country and all its accomplishments , I 'm still concerned with the lives of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who live within the boundaries of the U.S. Susan Vogt Covington , Ky .
