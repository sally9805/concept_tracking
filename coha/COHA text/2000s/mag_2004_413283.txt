In a traditional seaside retreat on the eastern end of New York 's Long Island , one family has relished the slow , simple pleasures of summertime for three generations in the five decades since Larry Zarchin 's parents bought the family 's Long Island vacation cottage , little seems to have changed in the sleepy , close-knit seaside town in which it is located . Screens let in cooling sea breezes and doors are left open and unlocked , says Larry 's wife , Kathy , so that neighbors always feel welcome to come inside . Like father , like daughters-here , where Larry spent the summers of his youth , the couple 's three children , Ellen , Laura , and Kara , passed their own childhood summers sailing , playing board games , or just enjoying the sun and salt air . Even the annual task of repainting the house takes on a certain idyllic quality , says Kathy . Cottage style is in the details-moldings painted white , collections displayed , bouquets of flowers . Personal STYLe What gives a house its cozy appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , collections , and details . * Painting outside and interior walls , furniture , even floors with cool country colors-whites , yellows , pale blues , soft grays-is a quick way to achieve a cottage look . Try painted wicker furniture , indoors or on the porch , or painted paneling and beadboard wainscoting. * Choose distinctive woodwork . Gingerbread trim , floor-to-ceiling molding , and Gothic-style doors and windows make for a handcrafted effect . The hues of rich woods , such as mahogany , speak for themselves . But even the unadorned has its place . The custom cabinets in Kathy and Larry 's recent kitchen addition ( RIGHT ) , made of unpainted pine with marble counters , seem natural to the house and help foster a true country look and feel . * Collections that take advantage of practical objects , including containers like ironstone bowls to display fruit and flowers or a fisherman 's wire basket to hold garden herbs ( ABOVE , RIGHT ) , serve a dual purpose and make the most of a cottage 's often-tight quarters . RIGHT : CABINETRY , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOME . The architecture of the 125-year-old house makes itself felt in ways both large and small . <p>
