SOVIET UNION UKRAINE VILLAGE OF CHERVOY 25 JANUARY 1933 <p> Since maria had decided to die her cat would have to fend for itself . She 'd already cared for it far beyond the point where keeping a pet made any sense . Rats and mice had long since been trapped and eaten by the villagers . Domestic animals had disappeared shortly after that . All except for one , this cat , her companion which she 'd kept hidden . Why had n't she killed it ? She needed something to live for ; something to protect and love-something to survive for . She 'd made a promise to continue feeding it up until the day she could no longer feed herself . That day was today . She 'd already cut her leather boots into thin strips , boiled them with nettles and beetroot seeds . She 'd already dug for earthworms , sucked on bark . This morning in a feverish delirium she 'd gnawed the leg of her kitchen stool , chewed and chewed until there were splinters jutting out of her gums . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the bed , refusing to show itself even as she 'd knelt down , calling its name , trying to coax it out . That had been the moment Maria decided to die , with nothing to eat and nothing to love . <p> Maria waited until nightfall before opening her front door . She reckoned that by the cover of darkness her cat stood a better chance of reaching the woods unseen . If anyone in the village caught sight of it they 'd hunt it . Even this close to her own death , the thought of her cat being killed upset her . She comforted herself with the knowledge that surprise was on its side . In a community where grown men chewed clods of earth in the hope of finding ants or insect eggs , where children picked through horse shit in the hope of finding undigested husks of grain and women fought over the ownership of bones , Maria was sure no one believed that a cat could still be alive . <p> * * * <p> Pavel could n't believe his eyes . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fur . It was unmistakably a cat . He 'd been collecting firewood when he saw the animal dart from Maria Antonovna 's house , cross the snow-covered road , and head toward the woods . Holding his breath , he glanced around . No one else had spotted it . There was no one else about ; no lights at the windows . Wisps of smoke , the only sign of life , rose from less than half the chimney stacks . It was as though his village had been snuffed out by the heavy snowfall ; all signs of life extinguished . Much of the snow lay undisturbed : there were hardly any footprints and not a single path had been dug . Days were as quiet as the nights . No one got up to work . None of his friends played , staying in their houses where they lay with their families huddled in beds , rows of enormous sunken eyes staring up at the ceiling . Adults had begun to look like children , children like adults . Most had given up scavenging for food . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short of miraculous-the reemergence of a creature long since considered extinct . <p> Pavel closed his eyes and tried to remember the last time he 'd eaten meat . When he opened his eyes he was salivating . Spit ran down the side of his face in thick streams . He wiped it away with the back of his hand . Excited , he dropped his pile of sticks and ran home . He had to tell his mother , Oksana , the remarkable news . <p> * * * <p> Oksana sat wrapped in a wool blanket staring at the floor . She remained perfectly still , conserving energy as she devised ways of keeping her family alive , thoughts which occupied her every waking hour and every fretful dream . She was one of the few who 'd not given up . She would never give up . Not as long as she had her sons . But determination itself was n't enough , she had to be careful : a misjudged endeavor could mean exhaustion , and exhaustion invariably meant death . Some months ago Nikolai Ivanovich , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raid upon a State granary . He had not returned . The next morning Nikolai 's wife and Oksana had gone looking for him . They 'd found his body by the roadside , lying on his back-a skeletal body with an arched , stretched stomach , his belly pregnant with the uncooked grain he 'd swallowed in his dying moments . The wife had wept while Oksana removed the remaining grain from his pockets , dividing it between them . On their return to the village Nikolai 's wife had told everyone the news . Instead of being pitied she 'd been envied , all anyone could think about were the handfuls of grain she possessed . Oksana had thought her an honest fool-she 'd put them both in danger . <p> Her recollections were interrupted by the sound of someone running . No one ran unless there was important news . She stood up , fearful . Pavel burst into the room and breathlessly announced : <p> - Mother , I saw a cat . <p> She stepped forward and gripped her son 's hands . She had to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tricks . But his face showed no sign of delirium . His eyes were sharp , his expression serious . He was only ten years old and already he was a man . Circumstances demanded that he forgo his childhood . His father was almost certainly dead : if not dead then dead to them . He 'd set off toward the city of Kiev in the hope of bringing back food . He 'd never returned and Pavel understood , without needing to be told or consoled , that his father would never return . Now Oksana depended upon her son as much as he depended upon her . They were partners and Pavel had sworn aloud that he 'd succeed where his father had failed : he 'd make sure his family stayed alive . <p> Oksana touched her son 's cheek . <p> - Can you catch it ? <p> He smiled , proud : <p> - If I had a bone . <p> The pond was frozen . Oksana rooted through the snow to find a rock . Concerned that the sound would attract attention , she wrapped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punctured a small hole in the ice . She put the rock down . Bracing herself for the black , freezing water , she reached in , gasping at the cold . With only seconds before her arm would become numb she moved quickly . Her hand touched the bottom and clutched nothing but silt . Where was it ? Panicking , she leaned down , submerging all of her arm , searching left and right , losing all feeling in her hand . Her fingers brushed glass . Relieved , she took hold of the bottle and pulled it out . Her skin had turned shades of blue , as though she 'd been punched . That did n't concern her-she 'd found what she was looking for , a bottle sealed shut with tar . She wiped away the layer of silt on the side and peered at the contents . Inside was a collection of small bones . <p> Returning to the house , she found that Pavel had stoked the fire . She warmed the seal over the flames , tar dripping onto the embers in sticky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rubbed her arm , restoring the circulation , ever attentive to her needs . With the tar melted , she tipped the bottle upside down and shook . Several bones snagged on the rim . She pulled them free , offering them to her son . Pavel studied them carefully , scratching the surface , smelling each one . Having made his selection he was ready to leave . She stopped him : <p> - Take your brother . <p> Pavel thought this a mistake . His younger brother was clumsy and slow . And anyway the cat belonged to him . He 'd seen it , he 'd catch it . It would be his victory . His mother pressed a second bone into his hand : <p> - Take Andrei . <p> * * * <p> Andrei was nearly eight years old and he loved his older brother very much . Rarely going outside , he spent most of his time in the back room where the three of them slept , playing with a pack of cards . The cards had been made by his father from sheets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift before he 'd set off for Kiev . Andrei was still waiting for him to come home . No one had told Andrei to expect anything different . Whenever he missed his father , which was often , he 'd deal the cards on the floor , playing patience . He was sure if he could just finish the pack then his father would come back . Was n't that why he 'd given him the cards before he left ? Of course , Andrei preferred playing with his brother , but Pavel no longer had time for games . He was always busy helping their mother and only ever played at night just before they got into bed . <p> Pavel entered the room . Andrei smiled , hoping he was ready to play a hand , but his brother crouched down and swept the cards together : <p> - Put these away . We 're going out . Where are your laptys ? <p> Understanding the question as an order , Andrei crawled under the bed to retrieve his laptys , two strips cut from a tractor tire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with string , served as a pair of makeshift boots . Pavel helped tie them tightly , explaining that tonight they had a chance of eating meat as long as Andrei did exactly as he was told . <p> - Is Father coming back ? <p> - He is n't coming back . <p> - Is he lost ? <p> - Yes , he 's lost . <p> - Who 's bringing us meat ? <p> - We 're going to catch it ourselves . <p> Andrei knew his brother was a skillful hunter . He 'd trapped more rats than any other boy in the village . This was the first time Andrei had been invited to accompany him on such an important mission . <p> Outside in the snow Andrei paid special care not to fall over . He often stumbled and tripped , for the world appeared blurred to him . The only things he could see clearly were objects he held very close to his face . If someone was able to make out a person in the distance-while all Andrei could see was a blur-he put it down to intelligence or experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would n't fall over and make a fool of himself . He 'd make his brother proud . This was more important to him than the prospect of eating meat . <p> Pavel paused by the edge of the woods , bending down to examine the cat 's tracks in the snow . Andrei considered his skill in finding them remarkable . In awe , he crouched down , watching as his brother touched one of the paw prints . Andrei knew nothing about tracking or hunting : <p> - Is this where the cat walked ? <p> Pavel nodded and looked into the woods : <p> - The tracks are faint . <p> Copying his brother , Andrei traced his finger around the paw print , asking : <p> - What does that mean ? <p> - The cat is n't heavy , which means there 'll be less food for us . But if it 's hungry then it 's more likely to go for the bait . <p> Andrei tried to absorb this information but his mind drifted : <p> - Brother , if you were a playing card what card would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king , a spade or a heart ? <p> Pavel sighed and Andrei , stung by his disapproval , felt tears beginning to form : <p> - If I answer do you promise not to talk anymore ? <p> -I promise . <p> - We wo n't catch this cat if you talk and scare the cat away . <p> -I 'll be quiet . <p> -I 'd be a knave , a knight , the one with a sword . Now you promised-not a word . <p> Andrei nodded . Pavel stood up . They entered the woods . <p> They 'd walked for a long time-it felt like many hours although Andrei 's sense of time , like his sight , was n't sharp . With the moonlight and the reflective layer of snow his older brother seemed to have little difficulty following the tracks . The two of them continued deep into the woods , farther than Andrei had ever gone before . He frequently ran in order to keep pace . His legs ached , his stomach ached . He was cold and hungry , and although there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt . The string binding the foot rags to the tire strips had come loose and he could feel snow edging under the soles of his feet . He did n't dare ask his brother to stop and retie them . He 'd promised-not a word . Soon the snow would melt , the rags would become sodden , and his feet would become numb . To take his mind off the discomfort he snapped a twig from a sapling and chewed the bark , grinding it down into a coarse paste which felt rough on his teeth and tongue . People had told him bark paste sated feelings of hunger . He believed them ; it was a useful thing to believe . <p> Suddenly Pavel gestured for him to remain still . Andrei stopped midstep , his teeth brown with bits of bark . Pavel crouched down . Andrei copied him , searching the forest for whatever his brother had seen . He squinted , trying to bring the trees into focus . <p> Pavel stared at the cat and the cat seemed to be staring at him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Why was n't it running away ? Hidden in Maria 's house , perhaps it had n't learned to fear humans yet . Pavel drew his knife , cutting the top of his finger and daubing with blood the chicken bone his mother had given him . He did the same with Andrei 's bait-a broken rat skull-using his own blood since he did n't trust his brother not to yelp and startle the cat . Without saying a word the brothers parted , heading in opposite directions . Back at the house Pavel had given Andrei detailed instructions so there was no need to talk . Once they were some distance apart , on either side of the cat , they 'd place the bones in the snow . Pavel glanced at his brother , to check that he was n't mucking up . <p> Doing precisely as he 'd been instructed , Andrei took the length of string from his pocket . Pavel had already tied the end into a noose . All Andrei had to do was position the noose around the rat 's skull . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ string would allow , getting down onto his stomach , crunching and compressing the snow . He lay in wait . Only now , on the ground , did he realize that he could barely see his own bait . It was a blur . Suddenly afraid , he hoped the cat would go toward his brother . Pavel would n't make a mistake , he 'd catch it and they could go home and eat . Nervous and cold , his hands began to shake . He tried to steady them . He could see something : a black shape moving toward him . <p> Andrei 's breath began to melt the snow in front of his face ; cold trickles of water ran toward him and down his clothes . He wanted the cat to go the other way , to his brother 's trap , but as the blur got closer there was no denying that the cat had chosen him . Of course , if he caught this cat then Pavel would love him , play cards with him , and never get cross again . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticipation . Yes , he 'd be the one to catch this cat . He 'd kill it . He 'd prove himself . What had his brother said ? He 'd warned against pulling the snare too early . If the cat was startled all would be lost . For this reason and the fact that he could n't be sure exactly where the cat was standing Andrei decided to wait , just to be sure . He could almost bring the black fur and four legs into focus . He 'd wait a little longer , a little longer ... He heard his brother hiss : <p> - Now ! <p> Andrei panicked . He 'd heard that tone many times before . It meant he 'd done something wrong . He squinted hard and saw that the cat was standing in the middle of his snare . He pulled the string . But too late , the cat had leapt away . The noose missed . Even so , Andrei pulled the lank string toward him , pathetically hoping that somehow there might be a cat on the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he felt his face go red with shame . Overcome with anger , he was ready to stand up and chase that cat and catch it and strangle it and smash its skull . But he did n't move : he saw that his brother remained flat on the ground . And Andrei , who 'd learned to always follow his brother 's lead , did exactly the same . He squinted , straining his eyes to discover that the blurred black outline was now moving toward his brother 's trap . <p> The anger at his little brother 's incompetence had given way to excitement at the cat 's imprudence . The muscles in Pavel 's back went tight . No doubt the cat had tasted blood , and hunger was stronger than caution . He watched as the cat stopped midstep , one paw in the air , staring straight at him . He held his breath : his fingers clenched around the string and waited , silently urging the cat on . <p> Please . Please . Please . <p> The cat sprang forward , opened its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he tugged the string . The noose caught around the cat 's paw , the front leg was snared . Pavel leapt up , yanking the string , tightening the noose . The cat tried to run but the string held fast . He pulled the cat to the ground . Screeching filled the forest , as though a creature far larger was fighting for its life , thrashing in the snow , arching its body , snapping at the string . Pavel was afraid the knot would break . The string was thin , frayed . As he tried to edge closer the cat pulled away , keeping out of reach . He cried out to his brother : <p> - Kill it ! <p> Andrei still had n't moved , not wishing to make another mistake . But now he was being given instructions . He jumped up , ran forward , immediately tripping and falling facedown . Lifting his nose out of the snow , he could see the cat up ahead hissing and spitting and twisting . If the string broke , the cat would be free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his voice hoarse , frantic : <p> - Kill it ! Kill it ! Kill it ! <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
