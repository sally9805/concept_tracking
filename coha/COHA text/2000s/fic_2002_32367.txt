The Night Class By Tom Piccirilli Dorchester Publishing Tom Piccirilli Cal 's ethics class was enough to drive him to murder . Professor Yokver ranted in front of his mahogany desk , leaping around the aisles like a lunatic minister preaching judgment and hellfire , just waiting for the speaking in tongues to take him over . He threw his pipe-cleaner arms up and gestured wildly , fingers waving like tendrils as he chanted , " What is evil , children ? What is good , what is evil ? Do you know ? " He bashed erasers against the blackboard for emphasis , and everyone else in the class actually seemed to be enjoying the show . " Do you know , children ? Do you ? " A freshman in the first row scribbled notes so quickly he looked like a Boy Scout trying to make a campfire by rubbing two sticks together . Intent on recording every word of Yokver 's tirade , the kid 's tongue hung panting from his mouth . What could he possibly be writing ? Cal looked at his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he wondered if he had the answer . On the other side of the room sat Candida Celeste , smiling that say-cheese , sensuous leer that still made his entrails buck when he was n't ready for it , showing off those perfect teeth . They made him squint , and he could n't stare at her lips straight-on without groaning . She kept primping night-sky black hair , her cheerleadersweater opened to the fourth button-the way she 'd done it back in freshman year-and dragged a pink fingernail down the length of her perfectly tanned cleavage . His first thought was that she must 've gone to Florida over the Christmas vacation . And then , with sudden awful clarity , he realized , Oh hell , the Yok 's actually turning her on . Cal felt a painful twinge behind his eyes , this scene so surreal in its own way . He coughed , shook his head , and checked his watch . 8:15 am . Another hour and twenty minutes of doom in the morning . " Are we keeping you from some appointment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wheeling in mid-stride , pacing down the aisle , up the aisle , down the aisle . The Yok knew how to throw in this funky southern drawl when he wanted to , playing into the juice of a Flannery O'Connor character , or maybe a Georgian Peach from Carson McCullers . At last , he stood before Cal 's seat and bent to examine him with a humorless smirk . Glancing to the left , Cal gave the professor the slow once-over as they watched each other , nearly chin to chin . Up close he saw the polka-dotted tie hanging askew , the finely trimmed goatee slightly off center and pointing at an odd slant , long hair tied into a ponytail that trailed to mid-spine . Chalk dust clung to him like mist . His spindly arms flailed so fiercely that he knocked his own glasses off , made a wheeling save , and caught them before they hit the floor . It was a nice move , actually , like the kung fu guys who toss the knives and catch them spinning as they come down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't let us stop you , Mr. Prentiss . Huhhh . Hessssss . " Yokver hissed against the lenses of his glasses and wiped them on his lapels . The swank patterns in the hipster sports jacket entranced Cal for a moment as he tried heading into the swirls . You could ease yourself down into them , diving deeper , and never surface again . " And where were you , hmmm ? What reverie snared you away from us , eh ? " An oncoming migraine set a tightening pair of pincers that took a mean hold . Early morning rush of red sunlight streamed in and caught Cal directly across his face , brighter than Candida Celeste 's smile , the venetian blinds open just wide enough to nail him . He winced and reared his head back out of the glare . Everyone turned in their seats and stared at him . It got like this sometimes . What were they all checking out ? ... as if someone was going to stand and point a finger and shout , " J'accuse ! " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , and he felt himself heading in that direction . The freshman in the first row overtook his burning notes , slowed his incessant writing , and finally stopped . The kid now swiveled in his chair and looked too . Candida Celeste chuckled when the Yok repeated his , " Hmmm ? " and so did the neckless football player sitting diagonally from her trying his damnedest to play footsies from that angle . He was n't going to make it , straining so hard that Cal heard the guy 's ankles pop . A couple of the others picked up on that " Hmmm " as well , echoing the tone and swinging into it . Willy and Rose added even more exaggerated " Hmmmms ? " of their own , Willy swaying in his seat , doing a little Stevie Wonder . They kept it up until they were in tune , key of F flat . Cal almost grinned . The girl seated directly in front of Candida Celeste made eye contact with him and smiled . It took a couple seconds but then she winked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Prentiss ? Where are you ? " " Right here in my seat , " Cal answered . " Not true . " " S'trewth . " " Not so . " " Okay , I 'm not here at all . " Maybe it was true . Sometimes it seemed to be . Anyway , the Yok liked droll answers , so let him chew on that one for a while . All Cal wanted to do now was get up and bolt . The paranoia came on pretty damn strong for this early in the morning , his high blood pressure-160 over 90 at twenty-two-jackhammering in his wrists , other thoughts caterwauling beneath the moment . The bottoms of his feet felt way too slick , as if the tile floor had been freshly waxed , and you 'd take a header if you got up too quickly and tried to run . Yokver liked to frolic in your nerve clusters . Cal said , " I 'm nowhere , " and tried to let it go at that , knowing , a part of him even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hmm , Hhh-mmh-hhhmmm hmmm hhmm ammm , " Willy and Rose went , bonding in laughter , gazing lovingly at each other even though they had no idea what they were really doing . " Eh ? " Candida said , those incisors so white and lovely . Yok gaped , those eyes filled with pride , a sorrow of some kind in there , but also a rich gratitude and appreciation for the focus . Cal knew that Yokver liked picking on him because it drew the rest of the class together . Perhaps they 'd find out what was good , and what was evil , right here and now . Cal swallowed , searching for saliva and finding only grit and moss on the roof of his mouth . " Sorry , " he said , doing his best to sound sincere . Could that really be the end of it ? ... could he shimmy off the hook ? It was an okay effort , but that probably was n't going to cut it . Yokver did n't go away . Like a wooden clack puppet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had real rhythm and athletic grace . " I did n't quite catch that , Mr. Prentiss . Did you say you were sorry ? " He 'd dropped the drawl , and did n't sound half as pleasing without the Dixie lilt . " And what are you sorry for ? " Plenty , Cal thought , concentrating on the middle dots of the Yok 's tie . There was a strain there . Cal sniffed . Garlic . Shrimp Scampi sauce ? He glanced up and saw that Yokver was actually waiting for an answer . What was the point of this kind of a drag-out ? Why keep on pushing even after you 'd shoved somebody up against the wall ? For the theater of it ? To impress the Boy Scout , to bag Candida ? Could be , but probably not . Those reasons were too identifiable , too human . Cal already knew that his one other class of the day , The Art of Romantic Poetry in the Modern Age , had been canceled . He just wanted to get some scrambled eggs with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , get a few more hours of sleep , maybe drink a six-pack later on this afternoon . He could flop for the rest of the day , do laundry , tool around on ebay for a while , and finish reading a novel he 'd borrowed from Willy . He 'd wait for the night before daring to slip into the library basement , and getting some real work done . Clearing his throat , Cal made the effort to grin but could n't get his lips to skid the right way . " Sorry for becoming distracted in the middle of your lecture . I was n't anywhere special at this particular instant , Professor Yokver , sir . " That should have been more than enough , really , Jesus . But sometimes he just could n't stop . The cloying need in him started rising , an urgency to press back some . He could n't tell if he was breathing anymore , and really hoped he had n't begun to pant . " Maybe I was fondly recollecting the pleasures and safety of the womb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , those long pale bony fingers going on and on and on , and said , " Pshaw , young master . Do n't be sorry . " Cal nodded . " I 'm not , really . " " No ? " " No . " He heard Jodi gasp in the seat behind him , one of those peevish , oh please do n't get us into even greater misfortunes ' sighs . She had them down cold . She knew better than anyone how he dreaded this course , but she still expected so much out of him while he was here , and he did n't exactly understand why . Jo was the reason he 'd taken Yokver 's PHILO 138 class in the first place . An 8:00 a.m. meeting usually proved to be more than enough to scare him off , but they spent so little time together lately that he signed up at pre-registration for it anyway . The timing also made it more convenient to sleep over in her room , although that had n't been playing out quite the way he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danced in Yokver 's eyes last week when Cal dropped the withdrawal slip on the professor 's desk showed just how big a kick the Yok got out of him , now that he knew Cal hated being in here . The air had gotten so frosty that Cal thought he had seen his breath . Crumpling the slip silently , Professor Yokver dumped it into his waste basket and went back to crossing out large sections of Nietzsche 's Twilight of the Idols . Ten days ago Yokver had lectured that there was no such thing as motion-using an arrow as an example , saying that at each interval of time the arrow was stationary , solidified within the space it occupied at that precise instant . It was the kind of capricious rationale that could open kids minds so long as they 'd never taken physics . He drove the point home by doing cartwheels across the front of the classroom , shouting , " I am not moving ! " That sounded fun when you told it , but being there threw a different , ugly spin on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had doctorates in Physics and Chemistry as well as Theology , the entire situation . Cal begged him to over-rule the drop-add forms and set him free . But the Dean only gave him a lingering glare that told him he should know better than to involve the man in something like this . Catch the Yok 's good side as he smiled and waggled his eyebrows now , putting on a whole floor show , doing some vaudeville . " You 're not sorry , eh ? No , of course you 're not . Then why ... ? " Hey , everybody had their breaking point . So just quit tearing at- " ... did you say ... " - my scabs- " ... that you were ... " - damn you . " ... Calvin ? " Okay , so there they were . It was the wormy , depreciating accent Yokver put on " Calvin " that did it ; the same way a bully taunted you by singing your full name while holding your lunchbox out of reach . By jabbing you in the chest , just under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Caleb , not Calvin , so the cheap shot failed anyway . But that was n't the point . Were things really this out of control ? Was the Yok waging a serious head-game , or was it just his cholesterol getting to him again ? Cal 's breath came in bites . " I thought it would be a polite way to get you off my back . " He closed his empty notebook . He sort of looked forward to receiving a failing grade now . Anything to get the hell out of here . Removing his glasses with one grand gesticulation , like Clark Kent snatching them off in an hour of need-the river flooding out the train trestle , the school bus without brakes careening on a curving mountain road-just short of yanking wide his shirt to reveal blue spandex , Yokver massaged the bridge of his nose and rubbed the indent of his eyes frantically . His ponytail wagged over his left shoulder , then his right , as he shook his head and loudly tsk tsked . " You apparently think you 've all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the true substance of this course . So , Calvin , why do n't you tell me what 's really on your mind ? " Caleb smiled , and the Yok 's eyebrows dropped a notch . It felt much better to be smiling . Something liquid and boiling inside suddenly became solid . His pulse was no longer thrashing around inside his wrists , but his hands still hurt a bit . He brushed his hair off his forehead and said , " If I wanted to watch a clown I 'd have gone to the circus . " " Is that so ? " " It is . For a lousy ten bucks fifty midgets will come out of a Volkswagen and I can even buy one of those neon baby flashlights to spin in the dark . Even those dancing poodles are more fun than watching you cartwheel . " Jodi snorted a bothered , " Uyh , Cal . " A few of the other kids aahed and hmmed like a choir warming up . Did they think they were in grade school or sitting in church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were they really that bored ? Of course they were , everybody always was . " I think the socially acceptable term currently being used is ' little people . ' " " I 've been in this class for three weeks , and so far you have n't taken a second from your Atlantic City lounge act to address any ethical , moral or social dilemmas , nor such involved issues as the afterlife , racism , censorship , pornography , abortion , or ... " He searched for something relevant , and everything came together in one long flash of images , even though he hardly ever thought of any of it himself . " ... prostitution , jihads , incest , Ruby Ridge , hedonism , war , or those peabrains who want to toss AIDS victims behind a fence in the desert , the new welfare laws , social security , Oklahoma City . " He swallowed , and his spit was thicker than syrup . " Suicide . " " Oh . " Other pictures came but he 'd already run the gamut , seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up her arms as she reached for him . " You squash Nietzsche , insult Camus , belittle Sartre , and ... " The Yok flicked his tongue , giving him a helpful hint . " ... and flick your tongue at Bertrand Russell and Socrates . " Cal knew he had to go for one final twist . C'm on already , the kidneys are soft tissue . " And I 've caught you looking at my girl 's cleavage . " Jodi grunted as if she 'd been knifed , and Yokver glanced at her , focusing on her chest , that smile swinging up way higher than it should , until the corners of his mouth nearly touched his earlobes . Cal wondered when he 'd let it go . Neckless asked Candida , " Who 's Jihad ? " She shrugged and gave Cal a sharp look that had something encouraging , frenzied , and carnal in it . Professor Yokver snickered , mimed panic by pulling his hair , mouth wide , then waved on for more , Bring it on home , Calvin . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a flame somewhere inside his cloudy eyes . Caleb knew the furrow that bisected his own forehead had grown dark and deep . " But more than that you would n't let me withdraw when I wanted to , you son of a bitch , and I 'm not squandering any more of my life in this hell . " " No ? " the Yok asked . " You 've got a better hell waiting , have you ? " " Probably . " Cal pointed . " And there 's chalk on your tie . I 'm bugging out of here . Have a nice day , everybody . " He grabbed his coat and was out the door and down two flights of steps before the crimson tinge left his vision and the full measure of what he 'd done set in . Jodi might have to take the brunt of it now . He might be expelled , so that he could n't complete the final piece of work that needed to be finished . His mouth hurt from the tightness of the snarl he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sweating in the hall , he glanced at the faces of other professors as they lectured with their doors open , echoing voices snapping down the corridors of history , all of them seeming to make sense . The acoustics were good , and their words echoed and resonated in his sternum . He calmed down a little and walked outside , feeling the cold of the morning hitting hard , the February breeze tickling his hackles . He had to force his brow to un-furrow , caught up in a wave of different anger and disappointment because Jo had n't followed him . Caleb listened to the clock tower chime once , indicating the half-hour . 8:30 . He 'd been alive today for only forty-five minutes . Ethics . Jesus , God . Ethics would be the death of him .
