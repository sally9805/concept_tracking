A little world out of nothing // Few intimations of Lucille Ball 's character and career can be found on her family tree . Hers is a classic instance of the comic talent that surfaces without genetic antecedent . There have been , of course , many such " sports " in show business , performers who sprang from generations of laborers or small-time entrepreneurs . But most often these comedians and clowns were first-generation Americans , breaking out from the poverty , illiteracy , and prejudice that still afflicted their parents . Moreover , the great majority of them came from the streets of New York City , where demonic energy was the only r ? sum ? they needed , and where opportunity lay all around them-from larceny and murder to medicine , law , and entertainment . // Lucille had little in common with the generation that was to beget laughter in vaudeville , in the legitimate theater , and on the sound stages of the 1930s . Compared to them she is a bloodline aristocrat .

" Lucille 's father , Henry Durrell Ball , was descended from landed gentry in England ; some of the family came to the New World as early as the seventeenth century . She was delighted to note that there was " some Ball blood in George Washington " since " his mother 's maiden name was Mary Ball . " If there were any deeper investigations of the Ball genealogy , Lucille did not record them . Actually , George Washington 's relationship with his mother was one that grew increasingly unpleasant and embarrassing . Hardly had George left home when Mary began to complain publicly about her son 's neglect . Rather than take pride in his early career , she used it as a lever to pry favors from him . During the French and Indian War , for example , he suffered terrible privations in the service of King George III . Mary displayed little interest in his ordeal ; her letters demanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parent and child remained until her death in 1789. // Evidently a number of Mary 's descendants were working folk and farmers , scattered about the United States , with little in the way of wealth or prospects . For one of them , fate intervened in 1865 , when oil was discovered in the appropriately named town of Pithole , Pennsylvania . Clinton Ball , Lucy 's great-grandfather , had property in the vicinity , accepted the enormous bid of $750,000 , and headed for the progressive , gaslit village of Fredonia , New York . There he built a large house and acquired an additional four hundred acres . Clinton must have found Protestant fundamentalism to his liking ; he donated generous sums to local churches , but made certain that anyone who preached there hewed to his literal interpretation of the Bible . Unsurprisingly , he looked upon city life as licentious and went so far as to forbid any of his six children to dance . // Five of them obeyed ; the sixth was an adventurer who wanted something more than received wisdom . Jasper Ball- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young and became a father soon afterward . He settled the family in Jamestown , New York , and began to invest his savings in the newfangled telephone business . When the hinterlands proved inhospitable to the invention he sought employment out west . The Securities Home Telephone Company of Missoula , Montana , hired him as manager , and for many years he shuttled between work and family , from the towns and villages of Montana to his home in upstate New York . In time Jap 's admiring son Henry Durrell Ball ( " Had " to family and friends ) came to Missoula and signed on as a lineman for the phone company . In 1910 Had returned to Jamestown to visit his mother and sisters , and while he was there someone introduced him to the eighteen-year-old Desir ? e Evelyn Hunt , the daughter of a professional midwife and a man who had worked at a number of trades , including hotel management , mail delivery , and furniture construction . ( She chose the Frenchified spelling ; " Desire " was the name on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractive older man . Several months later , on September 1 , 1910 , the two were married at the two-story gabled home of Frederick and Flora Belle Hunt . Some 140 guests witnessed the ceremony , conducted by the Reverend Charles D. Reed , pastor of the Calgary Baptist Church . It was the biggest social event of the season . Contemporary photographs show a pale , conventionally pretty young woman , and a husband so lean he appears to be two profiles in search of a face . // Laden with gifts of silver , linen , and furniture , the couple boarded a train and headed toward the sunset . They settled in the little town of Anaconda , Montana , about twenty-five miles from Butte . A couple of months later Desir ? e became pregnant . She expressed a desire to have the baby back home in Jamestown , where her mother could act as midwife . Had consented , and the couple went east in the summer of 1911 . On August 6 , Lucille Desir ? e was born . // Once Flora had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Montana-only to turn around and head back east . Securities Home Telephone had recently acquired the Michigan Telephone Company , and the company needed experienced linemen . The little family resettled in Wyandotte , outside Detroit , a town just far enough from the automobile industry to offer quiet tree-lined streets and clean air . Had regarded it as a fine place to raise a family , and pretty soon Desir ? e was pregnant again . Everything went well : Had was making five dollars a week , a good salary in those days , and the doctor said that Desir ? e was the ideal age and weight to bear a second child . As for little Lucille , she was an active , healthy youngster , fond of her mother and crazy about roughhousing with her father-she would scream with delight when he tossed her into the air and caught her inches from the floor . // All this was to change in the awful winter of 1915 . In January , cases of typhoid fever were reported in the Detroit area . Public health officials warned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpasteurized dairy products . Desir ? e scrupulously followed their instructions . Had went along for a while , but in early January he treated himself to a dish of ice cream . A week later he began to suffer from sleeplessness , then intestinal problems , and finally he developed a fever of 104 degrees accompanied by delirium . Physicians made a grim diagnosis and nailed a sign to the Balls ' front door : keep out-health authorities . Neighbors shut their windows and drew the curtains ; there was no vaccine at the time . The family doctor could do little beyond making Had comfortable and preparing Desir ? e for the end . // Distraught and overburdened , she kept Lucille out of the sickroom and in the fresh air for hours at a time . To ease her mind she tied one end of a rope around the child 's waist , the other end to a steel runner on the backyard clothesline . As long as she heard the metal squeal , Desir ? e knew that her little daughter was running like a trolley from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the noise stopped for longer than a few minutes she ran outside to see if Lucille had slipped the knot . The **25;847;TOOLONG never did escape , but on at least one occasion she tried . After an ominous silence Desir ? e found her batting her eyes and negotiating with a milkman : " Mister , help me . I got caught up in this silly clothesline . Can you help me out ? " // Had died on February 28 , 1915 . He was twenty-eight years old . Lucille retained only fleeting memories of that day , all of them traumatic . A picture fell from the wall ; a bird flew in the window and became trapped inside the house . From that time forward she suffered from a bird phobia . Even as an adult , she refused to stay in any hotel room that displayed framed pictures of birds or had wallpaper with an avian theme . // Had 's widow was twenty-two . She was five months pregnant , with a dependent child , little insurance , and no professional skills . Somehow she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Wyandotte , where her late husband was embalmed , and Jamestown , where he was to be interred . In order to get a little peace , Desir ? e enlisted the aid of a sympathetic grocer . Six decades later , Lucille gratefully summoned up images of Mr. Flower : " He let me prance up and down his counter , reciting little pieces my parents had taught me . My favorite was apparently a frog routine where I hopped up and down harrumphing . Then I 'd gleefully accept the pennies or candy Mr. Flower 's customers would give me-my first professional appearance ! " Those gifts came from customers who would rather donate money than pay condolence calls to a quarantined house . // Several days later Desir ? e and Lucille accompanied Had 's body on the long train ride to upstate New York . On the chill , iron-gray morning of March 5 , Had was buried at Lake View Cemetery in Jamestown . Lucille looked on blankly , oblivious to the glances in her direction . At the last moment , as Had 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit home . The little girl was led away screaming to her grandparents ' house on Buffalo Street in Jamestown . Mother and child had no other refuge . // So an autonomous nuclear family backslid to total dependence , as Desir ? e returned to the adolescence she had fled , reliant on her parents for food and shelter . Still , Fred and Flora Belle Hunt were kind and undemanding folks ; they did everything possible to make their daughter and granddaughter feel wanted and comfortable . The Hunts had lost their own son , Harold , at the age of eighteen , and when Desir ? e presented them with a grandson on July 17 , 1915 , they were deeply gratified . When she announced that she would christen him Frederick , after Grandpa Hunt , they were beside themselves . To all appearances , Lucille was once again in an affectionate and secure household . // But she was not satisfied with appearances . " I was largely ignored , " she remembered , " and I became very jealous . " Lucille had been struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a beloved father had abandoned her without so much as a good-bye . Five months later she had been displaced by a wailing rival who absorbed 100 percent of her mother 's love and attention . Confused , anxious about her own mortality , the child became fixated on her grandparents , a pair whose idiosyncrasies she came to cherish . Fred Hunt was an imposing figure , overweight and garrulous , with a wardrobe of three-piece suits that had seen better days . He stoked his omnipresent pipe with Prince Albert tobacco , played popular tunes on the parlor piano , whittled toys for his grandchildren , and palavered incessantly about the sorry condition of the Working Man in America . Hunt 's favorite philosopher was Eugene V. Debs , and he was forever booming the virtues of that fighter against economic injustice-a man " baptised in Socialism . " // As for Flora Belle , she had been a hotel maid in her youth and she retained both a winsome air and a vivid physical presence ; Lucille was to remember her Grandma Flora as " a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn the piano and to take pleasure in the familiar . These included free visits to the local amusement center . A five-cent streetcar ride brought her to Celoron Park , and admission was free . There Lucille Ball became an upstate Dorothy Gale , " dazzled by the brilliance of the Wonderful City , " with Celoron as her Oz . Four-decker picnic boats floated along the twenty miles of Lake Chautauqua ; stands offered pink cotton candy on a stick ; strollers could gawk at a bearded lady , a strong man , a snake charmer , a fortune- teller . As the wide-eyed children shrieked and giggled , the Phoenix Wheel took them a hundred feet in the air before descending to street level . A ramp let them slide deleriously into the shallows of the lake . John Philip Sousa 's men blared away on the bandstand . And a zoological garden allowed glimpses of exotic tigers , as well as the chance to ride Shetland ponies around a little track . Best of all were the nickelodeons , with their joyous two-reelers of Charlie Chaplin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as if Lucille had been granted compensation for all the losses of the last year-and a new kind of freedom was still to come . Desir ? e , brought low by Had 's early death , suffered from postpartum depression . Nothing seemed to lighten her burden , and after a few months Fred and Flora Belle determined that the only cure would be a complete change of scene . They bought their daughter a round-trip railroad ticket to California and took over the raising of the children . Two active youngsters were one too many for the aging couple ; they entrusted Lucille to her mother 's sister , Lola , then operating James-town 's busiest beauty salon . The move turned out to be one of the happiest periods in Lucille 's life . Aunt Lola had just married a Greek immigrant , George Mandicos , and the couple had eyes only for each other . Their charge came and went as she pleased , making faces in the wide glittering mirrors , nourishing a harmless crush on her uncle George , getting pats and compliments from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , Lucille recalled : " Once again I was an only child , with a mother and a father , and it was such a happy , relaxed time for me. " // She was never again to enjoy that status . Desir ? e came back restored and balanced . Of all the things she had seen out west , only one incident remained in her now placid mind . She had been riding on the same train as Douglas Fairbanks , and as it drew into Los Angeles the actor jumped from the train , vaulted a low barrier , and leaped into the arms of his wife , Mary Pickford , waiting for him in a baby-blue convertible . It was like a dream , Desir ? e told her parents ; she never expected to see movie stars up close again . // When World War I began , Desir ? e found work in a local assembly plant . There she caught the attention of the strapping , thirty-one-year-old Ed Peterson , a foreman in the sheet metal department . Ed 's large features were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he seemed surprisingly intelligent and well read . Not many eligible men lived in Jamestown ; Desir ? e overlooked the foreman 's reputation for drinking to excess . Their courtship was brief ; the pair announced wedding plans in the summer , and got married on September 17 , 1918. // Lucille fancied that Ed would simply slide into her father 's place and make the family whole again . Her dreams were dashed when she sidled over to the groom on his wedding day . &lt; //
