ExxonMobil , the Texas-based oil giant , has pledged $100 million over 10 years to research " innovative and cost-effective " ways of meeting the world 's energy needs . One of its partners in the project ? General Electric . <P> So why is GE generating such positive buzz with its green initiative while Exxon generally looks like sludge ? Look to the top . Lee Raymond , Exxon 's chairman and CEO , is a verbal gusher of anti-global-warming rhetoric who opposes mandatory caps on greenhouse-gas emissions . Environmentalists accuse Exxon of being the " No. 1 climate criminal , " responsible for the Bush Administration 's refusal to sign on to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol , which sets targets for reducing pollution that causes global warming . " We do think there is a risk of climate change , but there are much better approaches to making progress than mandatory caps , " says Sherri Stuewer , Exxon 's vice president of safety , health and environment . <P> Exxon shareholders are mostly on Raymond 's side . The boss , after all , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $25 billion in 2004 alone . " We do n't think the technology for renewables  --  whether solar or biomass  --  can support a profitable business , " says Stuewer . Electricity generated by solar , she notes , is five times as expensive ( for now ) as that produced by gas or coal . Exxon is investing in Stanford 's Global Climate and Energy Project , she says , to develop breakthroughs in solar , biofuel , hydrogen and even coal technologies that could be offered cheaply and profitably to developing countries , whose growing economies will require increasing fuel in the future . <P> Is GE wrong , then , about its bet on going green ? Exxon is a fuel company , while GE makes " devices , " says Stuewer . And therein lies the crux of their differences . Exxon did toy with alternative-energy technologies  --  most notably with solar in the 1970s  --  but failed miserably . " Who was brought in to clean it up ? Lee Raymond . He sold it all off , " says Ed Ahnert , who retired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He learned you stick to what you know best . " <P> Despite the environmental badmouthing , Exxon is pushing in-house energy efficiency and co-generation , which last year resulted in 10 million fewer tons of carbon dioxide released into the air  --  equal to taking a million cars off the road . But in the end Raymond is an oilman ; he believes fossil fuels are the only way to fill the 50% increase in global energy demand projected by 2030 . Raymond has called the Kyoto Protocol " flawed " and predicts that Europe wo n't be able to meet its emission-cutting goals . Exxon 's line is that there is " no scientific certainty " behind studies blaming fossil fuels for global warming . <P> Last month , as if to emphasize the point , Exxon hired Philip Cooney , the ex  --  White House staff member accused of revising government science reports to downplay the link between emissions and global warming . He will work in public affairs on the " issues group . " You can guess which one .  --  By Cathy Booth Thomas/Dallas  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
