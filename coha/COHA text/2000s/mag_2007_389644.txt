Advice from our guy guru , Jonathan Small Q. When I first start dating a guy , he 's really into me . But once we get into a relationship , my high-maintenance side starts to show . Then he decides I 'm too much work and bails out . Should I give guys some kind of heads-up ? A. While I respect that you can admit to your shortcomings , I 'm not sure you want to announce them to a man on , say , date three . I imagine it would go something like this : " Hey , I just want you to know that I 'm really high-maintenance and a pain in the butt , so you may not want to go out with me again . Mmm , the fish special looks good . " That being said , I do n't think you should try to mask your true self either . You could ease a guy into your quirks by showing him the real you in bits and pieces  --  for example , if your food is undercooked , send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , " Sorry , I do n't do the outdoors . " Photograph : Tamara schlesinger . Who knows , maybe he 'll find your eccentricities charming . But I would n't bank on it . There 's a reason why none of your relationships have worked out : Guys can tolerate a lot of things , but a high-maintenance chick is a really tough sell . An even better idea is to try to change your behavior . In order for a relationship to work , both parties have to learn to compromise ... that means you too ! Trust me , life will be a whole lot easier if you loosen up and cut a guy some slack . Sure , you can continue to focus on giving warnings , but I think in the end you 'll be much happier if you work on mellowing out instead . Q. I 've been with my guy for a couple of years , and I 've asked him a number of times if there is anything he wants to do to shake up our sex life . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are . But then , out of nowhere , he told me that he thinks our routine is lacking and he wants to start trying some kinkier things . How come he never mentioned this before when I asked ? A. Hey , if my girl asked me what I thought of our sex life , red warning signs would start flashing in my head and a booming voice in my brain would be shouting , " Do not enter ! " It 's one of those loaded questions like " Do you think Scarlett Johansson is hot ? " or " Do I look fat in these jeans ? " You think you want an honest answer , but once you get it , you 'll jump right down his throat . Photograph : Anna Palma . Another possibility is that he did n't have any particular requests when you brought it up . But things change , and sex gets stale . He may have thought your lust life was smoking before , and only now has he decided that it needs work . He also may feel more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can voice his concerns more freely . But here 's a question : Why did you ask him if he wanted to shake things up in the first place ? Were you really curious what he thought or were you telling him  --  in a passive-aggressive way  --  that you wanted to get your kink on ? If you 'd like to mix things up , just say so . As long as you are n't blaming him for the lack of spark , he 'll be psyched to hear what 's on your naughty wish list . Q. One drunken night a few weeks ago , I hooked up with one of my good guy friends . He went on and on about how he 's always had feelings for me and wanted us to be together . I was psyched , but then he never called after that . When I saw him a week later , he acted like he barely knew me . Do you think he just said all those things to get me to sleep with him ? A. Put simply , your so-called good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he thought you needed to hear . Or once he finally knocked boots with you , the sexual tension fizzled . Either way , it 's messed up of him to treat you like some random conquest . So what do you do now ? Well , clearly , you have feelings for this guy , but I have to be honest with you : A relationship is not going to happen . And I do n't think you should even consider being with such an inconsiderate piece of ... anyway , moving on . You feel betrayed , and you have every right to call him out on what he did . In fact , I think this guy deserves a little ass reaming . At this point , what do you have to lose ? This friendship is pretty much finished , so the only thing left to save is your self-respect . Call him up and ask him flat out , " Is there a reason why you 're suddenly ignoring me ? It would n't happen to be because we slept together , would it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to treat someone you 've always considered a friend . " Go on to say that you do n't want a relationship with him , but you think he should have the decency to acknowledge you . Your bitch-out session wo n't erase the past , but at least you can walk away from the experience knowing you stood up for yourself . Q. I trust my boyfriend , but he 's been hanging out a lot with this female coworker . I was n't concerned at first because she 's not very attractive . And we 've gone on a double date with her and her fianc , and they seem to be in love . But she and my guy have become so close that I 'm starting to worry . Do you think he could develop feelings for her ? A. Well , I was encouraged to hear that no alarms went off during the double date . Women have good instincts , and if there were chemistry between them , you would have spotted it from a mile away . Plus , if she seems in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something extra on the side . Still , I do n't blame you for being concerned . Why would your man want to become BFF with another woman when he has you in his life ? Ask yourself what she 's giving him that you 're not . Maybe she pays attention when he talks about his job , tells him how great he is , or knows how to go with the flow . Do you do these things too ? Because this friendship could be making up for something that 's lacking in your relationship . At this point , you ca n't confront him about her because there 's no evidence that they 're doing anything wrong . A better plan is to be more attentive to him and more interested in his day-to-day life  --  basically , a good friend . If late nights at work become a regular thing though , then it 's time to worry . Q. I 'm a fun , good-looking girl with a lot to offer , but I 've only had sex once . I 'm just 20 years old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I 'm worried that guys I sleep with will think I 'm bad in bed . Do men notice , and if so , should I mention that I 've only been with one guy ? A. First off , no  --  do n't mention your lack of experience . He does n't need nor want to hear how unsure you feel . Plus , sex is n't an exact science . A couple always has to go through a period of trial and error to figure out what the other wants . And remember that men are as worried about pleasing you as you are about turning them on . Another point to keep in mind : I think most young guys are just so happy to be getting some that they wo n't notice if your moves are n't totally smooth . What a man really cares about is your enthusiasm . You could bust out every Cirque du Soleil move in the book  --  what will really make an impression is how gung ho you were about getting it on . What will turn him off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make him feel like a perv if he suggests something a little raunchy . I 'm not saying that you should do things you do n't want to , but go into it with an open mind . At the end of the day , sex is our most primal instinct  --  your body will figure out on its own what it needs to please .
