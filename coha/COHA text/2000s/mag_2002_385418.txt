// She 's stolen scenes from half of Hollywood . Now we steal an afternoon with Gosford Park 's MAGGIE SMITH  --  and come out unscathed . " IT 'S TROPICAL IN HERE , " SHE SAYS . " TROPICAL ! " DAME Maggie Smith is peering out from a corner table in the Conservatory , a restaurant in London 's Lanesborough hotel . It looks like a place where you 'd expect to find a plumed colonial viceroy sipping quinine and gin . The walls are pink and green . The roof is glass . The decor is a riot of potted palms and Chinese figurines . And for some reason , the room feels as if it 's being pumped full of steam . " Ridiculous , is n't it ? " she says , exhaling through her famous pursed lips . " Mad dogs and Englishmen . One feels as if one 's in Rangoon . " She pronounces the word " Rangoon " with about seven descending o 's . You can ask Maggie Smith questions-about her roots in English theater , about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snooty grande dame she plays in Robert Altman 's Gosford Park , about her participation in the global juggernaut of Harry Potter ( as the young wizard 's professor Minerva McGonagall ) . She 'll answer you , too , sort of , even though she considers interviews to be " nerveracking and daft . " Frankly , though , it 's more fun just to listen to her talk . About anything . About the proximity of a tape recorder to her face : " Oh , do not hold it out to me , please . Ca n't you write anything down ? I do n't want it just staring at me . " About the frenzy she encountered at the Golden Globes : " That was luuudicrous ! Miles and miles and miles of red carpet ! " About the thespian advice she has given to her sons , actors Toby Stephens , 32 , and Chris Larkin , 34 , both the products of Smith 's temptestuous first marriage , to actor Robert Stephens : " None , " she says . " They 've been with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( That has n't stopped them , though . Toby is shooting the new James Bond movie , and Chris has signed on for a film with Russell Crowe . ) About her age , which is only 67 , although everyone assumes she 's older : " Anthony Powell was doing the costumes on Hook , and Steven Spielberg said to him , How old is Maggie Smith ? ' And Anthony , without pausing , said , " Ninety  --  two . " I think I 've been 92 ever since . The rot set in . " About how this very building , now this very posh hotel , used to house London 's St. George 's Hospital : " This is creepy . It will always be a hospital to me . I 'd hate to stay here . Can you imagine thinking : Am I in the operating theater ... ? Horrible . " She laughs-a laugh that goes from raspy to flutey to conspiratorial . Listening , you get caught up in the sheer pungency of her phraseology-in her loving fondness for words like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then , out of the blue , she 'll say something that stops you cold . " But , " she says , " I do know a few people who died here . " It 's just this kind of commentary-swarming and cutting and sporadically sad-that Smith dishes out in the languid parlors of Gosford Park . Almost four decades ago Richard Burton , her costar in The V.I.P. 's , accused her of " grand larceny , " and she 's still at it . As Gosford 's Lady Constance of Trentham , she nearly embezzles a whole movie ; her twitches , quips , and dismissals repeatedly bring down the house . To direct her , " you just turn the camera on and sit back and enjoy yourself , " says Altman . " I do n't think you 'd ever catch Maggie Smith phoning anything in . " ( Meanwhile , here in the Conservatory , a piano player is scampering through warhorses like " As Time Goes By . " If you 've seen the way she treats Jeremy Northam in the movie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) It 's been that way for years ; she may plead innocence , but she remains the Lucky Luciano of scene  --  stealers . Hold a private Maggie Smith Film Festival and you 'll wonder whether writers-even William Shakespeare-always had her in mind when they stuffed certain lines with ammonium nitrate . In the 1995 version of Richard III , she howls at Ian McKellen , stretching the epithet " You toad ! " into about 11 syllables . During a scarlet harangue in The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie , for which she won the 1969 Best Actress Oscar , she stuns Celia Johnson with verbal spitballs like " fetid frustration " and " slllime . " " When you write a normal screenplay and the lines come out of Maggie Smith 's mouth , processed through her brain , the lines themselves are just underscored , " says Altman . Barely a film goes by in which her character does n't lacerate somebody with language . " Yes , it 's true , " she says , sighing . " I 'm always playing this sort of formidable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get sort of stuck with that . It 's a bit boring . " Boring , no . Intimidating , yes-especially when you 're sharing tea and lemon with her , and the room is hot . In person , though , there is something remarkably vulnerable about Maggie Smith . In 1988 she came down with Graves ' disease , the hyperthyroid condition that causes a person 's eyes to ache , swell , and protrude . " It was horrible , because this is the most important part of your face , as an actor , " she says , her hands hovering in front of her blue orbs . " If ever my eyes feel sore , I panic dreadfully . " There are other things that make her shudder . She recalls a TV interview to promote 1987 's The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne-in which she played a Dublin spinster grappling with booze , poverty , and romantic delusions-and the memory seems to salt an old wound . " Oh , God , I remember doing an awful thing with , is he called Tremble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gumbel ? " Yeah , " she says . Her hands go to her temples again ; she shuts her eyes . " I was in a studio here , and he was talking to me from New York , and he said .. oh , it was just , I get all hot thinking about it again .. he said something like , " Who do you think wants to watch this depressing film ? ' It was so awful , I ca n't say . It was terrible . " If she sees Gumbel 's face now , she switches off the TV . " Because he makes my nerves so bad , " she says . " It all comes back to me . The horror . The horror and the humiliation . " She 's often described as reclusive ; she does n't take issue with that . " I probably am , " she says . " But that 's all right . I mean , the opposite is what ? Whirling around and going to all these things ? " It 's telling that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she did n't go as Maggie Smith ; she went as Diana Barrie , the Oscar-losing diva in California Suite , so that director Herbert Ross could shoot real red-carpet scenes for the movie . She did go again the year after-and won Best Supporting Actress for California Suite-but she can recall only a blur . " I was there for a good evening , but it did n't happen . Well , it did . But I mean , I did n't get to sit there very long , " she says . " You 're kind of whirled away into total hysteria . " All the other times she was nominated ? She just did n't gothere was always a play opening in London , or a conflict of some sort . Which is not to paint her as a kind of Academy refusenik . Out of her bag she pulls a paperback-Adam Gopnik 's Paris to the Moon-and the bookmark is an envelope . " How 's this for affectation ? " she laughs . " It 's my vote . " Inside the envelope is her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's sealed , " she says . " It 's got to be sent . " And whom did she vote for ? " I 'm not going to say , " she snaps teasingly . " You get a little note saying Do not tell anybody how you voted . " ' Surely , though , she always votes for herself . " No , " she says . " Not every year .
