Du Pr looked east . The sky was a patchwork of small fluffy clouds and the air was still . The clouds hung like balloons . A big jet roared down the runway and lifted off , the thunder of its engines faded . Soon it was just a silver speck far to the west . The little white jet sailed in , almost silently , and the pilot reversed the engines and slowed it , then turned toward the private hangar . " I bet she is six inches taller , " said Madelaine . Du Pr shook his head . " Three , " he said . " Bad air stunt her . " The door opened down and became a stair . A duffel bag was tossed out on the asphalt , then a backpack , and finally Pallas came down the steps carrying two suitcases . Du Pr walked to her , Madelaine hooting behind him . " It is too six ! " she said . Du Pr looked at his granddaughter . " You are taller , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Jacqueline , she will not like that . " Du Pr picked up the dufflebag and the backpack and he and Pallas walked to Madelaine , and Pallas put the suitcases down and she kissed Madelaine and then she kissed Du Pr . " We got one errand , " said Madelaine , " then we go home . " " Good , " said Pallas . " I miss them . Few days I will not miss them and be glad to go back , but for now I miss them . " They walked to the big SUV , a dark green one , and put Pallas 's luggage in the second seat . Then they got in and Du Pr drove to the box store . They bought a thousand dollars ' worth of groceries , household supplies , tools , and odds and ends . The store was busy . After Du Pr paid , they wheeled the threegrocery carts and the big flat cart out to the SUV . " Never get it all in , " said Pallas . " Then you take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strap things on the roof , " said Pallas . Du Pr looked at her . " No , Grandpa , " said Pallas . " Not me . " They stacked and tucked and shoved and Pallas cursed fluently . " You , " said Madelaine , " watch your mouth , you ride on the roof , Pallas . " " I learn the best words from you , " said Pallas . Du Pr turned away to laugh . They got in and Du Pr got on the highway east . They were soon out of Billings , and they passed the highway that went south to the Crow Reservation and on to Denver . " I have never been to Little Big Horn , " said Pallas . " Not much to see , " said Madelaine . " Looks like Montana , Wyoming , hills , grass , but it do n't feel sad like the Marias or other places .... " Other massacres , Du Pr thought , only then it was the Indians being slaughtered . Me , I go to the Little Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can other places . Voices behind the wind . " What you hear when you are there , Du Pr ? " said Madelaine . Du Pr shook his head . " Horses maybe , " he said . " I do n't know . " Madelaine turned to look at Pallas crouched under a rampart of stuff that was piled on the seat and on top of the backrests . " You are getting crap you are an Indian ? " said Madelaine . " You are some Indian but French and Scot , too . " " Everybody likes Indians , " said Pallas . " No , I just get dumb questions . " " Oh , " said Madelaine . " Them . " " How is Chappie doing ? " said Pallas . " He is OK , " said Madelaine . " Leg works pretty good . He has lots of colds . " " He will be around now ? " said Pallas . " Your other kids do n't come back here . " " They will come back , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . " Du Pr grunted . Madelaine have four kids , two in the military , one in Africa , working for an oil company , one in Chicago , studying art . Chappie is in Iraq . Bomb take off his leg and put out his left eye . So he is retired from military . Coughs a lot . " So , " said Pallas , " I have a month now . They tell me I have to wait until August to come , but I say no , I have to go now , have ceremonies to perform . Then they are able to find out I do n't have to stay until August . " Du Pr and Madelaine laughed . " Maybe we send you back with a warpole , " said Madelaine . " Hang a bunch of scalps on it . " " Yeah , " said Pallas , " that would be what they all call awesome . They use awesome when they mean good and impacts when they mean effects . " Du Pr laughed . Pallas she can talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I just heard it . " So it is all right ? " said Madelaine . Pallas nodded . " Maria come for a week , " she said . " From England , and I am so very homesick . They do n't got mountains there and they got all these people . Pile in one place they would be a ver ' big mountain , and after she is there a while I cry some and she says , well , get all you can and you can go back but not until you are done . " " She is your aunt , " said Madelaine . " You listen to her . " " Sure , " said Pallas . " She goes through a long argument , wins it because I am not talking back , and then she says she will break my nose if I quit . " " She will break your nose , " said Du Pr . " That Maria keeps promises . " Du Pr fished the silver flask out of the console and he popped the top open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She shook her head . " What about me ? " said Pallas . " You are too young , drink whiskey , " said Du Pr . " Good , " said Pallas . " I will take drugs then . " " Oh , crap , " said Madelaine , fishing a bottle of pink wine out of the cooler at her feet . " Have some of my pink wine and leave your grandfather 's whiskey alone . " " Now it is illegal to have booze in a car , " said Pallas . " Yah , " said Du Pr . " Montana , they are going to stop people driving with a drink , " said Pallas . " How do they think they will do that without lots of people getting shot ? " " Federal government , " said Du Pr . " Oh , " said Pallas . " Them . " " They say they do n't give Montana highway money if Montana do n't stop people who drink , go down the road , " said Du Pr . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in Helena , passes laws they like in that Washington and then they forget them like the speed limit . " " Yah , " said Du Pr . " Remember when Jacqueline throws Raymond 's piss , hits the Highway Patrol car ? " said Pallas . " Yah , " said Du Pr . " You think they would learn , " said Pallas . " No , " said Du Pr , " they do n't learn . " They drove on , silent , while Madelaine and Pallas drank pink fizzy wine and Du Pr smoked . " Pret ' soon you ca n't smoke in car , either , " said Pallas . " Yah , " said Du Pr . " Tobacco got lots of taxes now , " said Pallas . " Not where I get it , " said Du Pry say that anyway . " " Ah , " said Pallas . " You are going to give your grandfather crap about smoking ? " said Madelaine . " Sure , " said Pallas . " He do n't give me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Madelaine . Pallas pulled out a cigarette from her purse and she lit it . Du Pr laughed . " Do n't they arrest you , Maryland , you smoke you are fifteen ? " said Madelaine . " Do if they catch you , " said Madelaine . " I live in this house , other kids my age , all of us smart . We do n't have a lot of trouble . " Du Pr snorted . " Pissants , " he said . " Biggest political party . " " Hey , " said Pallas , " there is a coyote ... , " and she stared out the window . Du Pr glanced to his right . The coyote was trotting along , sliding through the sagebrush . A large bird flew up and the coyote leaped up and caught it . " Sage grouse , " said Pallas . " They are pret ' dumb , " said Du Pr . They came to the road north . Du Pr took the exit and then they crossed over the Interstate . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Pallas , " I am home . " The road was an empty gray ribbon winding north over the rolling yellow hills . " They got pilots now watching for people like you , " said Madelaine . " Yah , " said Du Pr , " they do n't bother me . " The big SUV shot down the road . Du Pr slowed when he came up to a hilltop . You never knew when a rancher hauling a piece of equipment at ten miles an hour might be just out of sight . The puff clouds hung motionless . " Those are Lucky Strikes ? " said Madelaine to Pallas . " Sure , " said Pallas . " You want me to smoke something else ? " " Give me one , " said Madelaine . " I have not seen Chappie for maybe ten years ? " said Pallas . " Yah , " said Du Pr . " It is too bad , " said Pallas . " I think all that Iraq business wo n't work out well at all . " 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
