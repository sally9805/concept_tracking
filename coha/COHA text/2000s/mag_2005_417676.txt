The new Humax DVR lets you keep your favorite recordings . You know a technology has arrived when it becomes the verb for functions we depend on every day . You " Google " a subject on the Internet and you " TiVo " a TV show you want to record . TiVo , the generic verb for digital video recording onto a hard drive , may have pioneered the DVR market in 1997 , but these days you 'll find DVR functionality in everything from cable boxes to PCs . With competition closing in fast , TiVo and its partners continue to expand products and services to keep ahead of the pack . Digital recording is a great improvement over clumsy VCR technology , with its juggling of half-blank tapes and complicated menus , but there is one big limitation with first-generation DVRs : They are simply temporary holding tanks for TV programs . At some point something 's got to go-either the finale of " The Apprentice " or the pilot of " Lost . " You have to free up space on the hard drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could record to an external device-either your old VCR or a new outboard DVD recorder-but that multiplies the hassle factor . For the past month , though , I 've been testing an advance in TiVo evolution in the form of a device called the Humax DRT800 . The Humax DRT800 is a super TiVo , a next-gen TV fan 's tool that packs its own DVD recorder . For $499 , plus a $299 lifetime TiVo fee , the DRT800 lets me cram 80 hours of TV ( twice the amount of early-model TiVo units ) onto its hard disk and then-here 's the really new part-offload the shows I want to keep onto DVDs . The upshot : I do n't have to wait for Netflix to capture the latest season of " Six Feet Under . " I can follow no-brainer onscreen prompts and burn my own discs after the episodes air on HBO . TOGETHER AT LAST Having the hard disk and DVD recorder integrated in the same box makes for a convenient synergy . Pick programs from your hard drive 's list of recorded shows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they 'll fit on a DVD . I wanted Alfred Hitchcock 's " Rope , " which was playing on Turner Classic Movies , so I selected the best-quality recording mode . That 's when I hit my first snag . Oddly , the screen told me I 'd need two DVDs for the job , even though the version I 'd rented earlier at Blockbuster easily fits on one DVD . It turns out that a DVD recorded on the Humax can hold only an hour 's worth of audio and video in best-quality mode . But here 's the irony . " Rope " was shot to look as though it was filmed in one continuous take . Instead of viewing it as the director intended , I had to swap discs 56 minutes into the movie , creating my own cut . Tony Goncalves , Humax USA 's vice president of sales and marketing , explained that movie studios use more expensive dual-layer discs and sophisticated technology to record movies for the rental market . Consumer digital video recorders rely on single-layer DVD burners and discs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and DVD-RW media I used worked with my Pioneer DVD player . TIVO TAKE 2 Beyond its DVD-burning chops , the Humax DRT800 boasts a couple of skills that basic TiVo recorders do n't have . As a second-generation TiVo box ( Series2 ) , it packs a USB port for networking with PCs and other TiVo boxes . As more homes are wired for Ethernet , that will be a handy feature for shuttling TV shows , music and digital images from the PC hard drive throughout the house-if you 're willing to pay for multiple TiVo subscriptions . Series2 TiVo boxes also can take programming commands from the Internet , which comes in handy when I 'm traveling and decide there 's a program I want to record . If my TiVo is n't connected to the Net , I have to schedule a program at least 36 hours in advance so the instructions can get to my box during TV guide updates . While these additional features are promising , they do n't outshine the core capabilities that the DRT800 shares with all TiVo boxes . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because the hard disk is always recording , I can pause and rewind live TV . And I can fast-forward through commercials . I also like Season Pass , which automatically catches all the shows from a season series so I do n't have to remember to record my favorite programs each week . One of my favorite classic TiVo features is WishList , a keyword search that hunts down and records programs based on things like subject or actor . Using the onscreen alphabet and remote control , I can plug in a word and TiVo will automatically record shows that have that word in the program description . I like Chris Cooper 's offbeat movies so I have him on my WishList , and TiVo is also scouring the airwaves for episodes of " Mister Ed . " After living with the Humax DRT800 for a month , I give high marks to the box for its ease of use , large recording capacity and built-in DVD recorder . It 's missing a few things I want , though , such as HDTV recording and simultaneous dual-program recording @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally alerted that Time-Warner Cable would be offering its combination cable box/ DVR , which has these features . TiVo plans to go hi-def in the first quarter of 2006 , which will be a welcome upgrade . The dualrecording feature is a tougher issue because cable only provides dual tuners in their own DVRs . All in all , the DRT800 is very reasonably priced and gives me two products in one . In fact , it far exceeds its limits . <p>
