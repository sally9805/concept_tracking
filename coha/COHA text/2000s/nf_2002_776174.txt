The Christian Revolution // Europe is the Faith .  --  Hilaire Belloc // The end of the twentieth century was marked by an obsessive compilation of retrospective lists , which assessed the greatest moments and the most important individuals of the previous hundred years . Some observers , still more ambitious , tried to identify the high and low points of the whole millennium then passing . Yet in almost all these efforts , religious matters received remarkably short shrift . When religious individuals were highlighted , they were usually those most closely identified with secular political trends . Martin Luther King Jr . is an obvious example . After all , the attitude seemed to be , what religious change in recent years could possibly compete in importance with the major secular trends , movements like fascism or communism , feminism or environmentalism ? To the contrary , I suggest that it is precisely religious changes that are the most significant , and even the most revolutionary , in the contemporary world . Before too long , the turn-of-the-millennium neglect of religious factors may come to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review of the eighteenth century that managed to miss the French Revolution . // We are currently living through one of the transforming moments in the history of religion worldwide . Over the past five centuries or so , the story of Christianity has been inextricably bound up with that of Europe and European-derived civilizations overseas , above all in North America . Until recently , the overwhelming majority of Christians have lived in White nations , allowing theorists to speak smugly , arrogantly , of " European Christian " civilization . Conversely , radical writers have seen Christianity as an ideological arm of Western imperialism . Many of us share the stereotype of Christianity as the religion of the " West " or , to use another popular metaphor , the global North . It is self-evidently the religion of the haves . To adapt the phrase once applied to the increasingly conservative U.S. electorate of the 1970s , the stereotype holds that Christians are un-Black , unpoor , and un-young . If that is true , then the growing secularization of the West can only mean that Christianity is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future must be Islam . // Over the past century , however , the center of gravity in the Christian world has shifted inexorably southward , to Africa , Asia , and Latin America . Already today , the largest Christian communities on the planet are to be found in Africa and Latin America . If we want to visualize a " typical " contemporary Christian , we should think of a woman living in a village in Nigeria or in a Brazilian favela . As Kenyan scholar John Mbiti has observed , " the centers of the church 's universality are no longer in Geneva , Rome , Athens , Paris , London , New York , but Kinshasa , Buenos Aires , Addis Ababa and Manila . " Whatever Europeans or North Americans may believe , Christianity is doing very well indeed in the global South  --  not just surviving but expanding . // This trend will continue apace in coming years . Many of the fastest-growing countries in the world are either predominantly Christian or else have very sizable Christian minorities . Even if Christians just maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Kenya , Mexico and Ethiopia , Brazil and the Philippines , there are soon going to be several hundred million more Christians from those nations alone . Moreover , conversions will swell the Christian share of world population . Meanwhile , historically low birth rates in the traditionally Christian states of Europe mean that these populations are declining or stagnant . In 1950 , a list of the world 's leading Christian countries would have included Britain , France , Spain , and Italy , but none of these names would be represented in a corresponding list for 2050. // Christianity should enjoy a worldwide boom in the new century , but the vast majority of believers will be neither white nor European , nor Euro-American . According to the respected World Christian Encyclopedia , some 2 billion Christians are alive today , about one-third of the planetary total . The largest single bloc , some 560 million people , is still to be found in Europe . Latin America , though , is already close behind with 480 million . Africa has 360 million , and 313 million Asians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If we extrapolate these figures to the year 2025 , and assume no great gains or losses through conversion , then there would be around 2.6 billion Christians , of whom 633 million would live in Africa , 640 million in Latin America , and 460 million in Asia . Europe , with 555 million , would have slipped to third place . Africa and Latin America would be in competition for the title of most Christian continent . About this date , too , another significant milestone should occur , namely that these two continents will together account for half the Christians on the planet . By 2050 , only about one-fifth of the world 's 3 billion Christians will be non-Hispanic Whites . Soon , the phrase " a White Christian " may sound like a curious oxymoron , as mildly surprising as " a Swedish Buddhist . " Such people can exist , but a slight eccentricity is implied . // This global perspective should make us think carefully before asserting " what Christians believe " or " how the church is changing . " All too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or what " Catholics today believe " refer only to what that ever-shrinking remnant of Western Christians and Catholics believe . Such assertions are outrageous today , and as time goes by they will become ever further removed from reality . The era of Western Christianity has passed within our lifetimes , and the day of Southern Christianity is dawning . The fact of change itself is undeniable : it has happened , and will continue to happen . So little did we notice this momentous change that it was barely mentioned in all the media hoopla surrounding the end of the second millennium . // LOOKING SOUTH // The idea of Christianity literally " going South " is not unfamiliar , at least to religious studies scholars . The theme is well-established in Europe , where African affairs are more attended to than they are in the United States . As long ago as the 1970s , this global change was discussed in well-known works by European scholars like Andrew Walls , Edward Norman , and Walbert Buhlmann , and the theme was consecrated by its inclusion in the World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buhlmann who coined the term " the Third Church , " on the analogy of the Third World . The phrase suggests that the South represents a new tradition comparable in importance to the Eastern and Western churches of historical times . Walls sees the faith in Africa as a distinctive new tradition of Christianity comparable to Catholicism , Protestantism , and Orthodoxy ; it is " the standard Christianity of the present age , a demonstration model of its character . " When in 1998 the World Council of Churches commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of its founding , it decided to meet in Zimbabwe , as an explicit recognition of the growing significance of Africa in world Christianity . // Yet outside the ranks of scholars and church bureaucrats , few commentators have paid serious attention to these trends , to what I will describe as the creation of a new Christendom , which for better or worse may play a critical role in world affairs . In the catalogues of North American religious publishers , materials either from or about Africa or Asia are rarely in evidence . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information for sinister motives , but they know from experience that Third World topics rarely attract a general audience of the sort that would make a new title profitable . For whatever reason , Southern churches remain almost invisible to Northern observers . When in 2000 , the popular evangelical magazine Christian History listed the " hundred most important events in Church history , " the only mention of Africa , Asia , or Latin America involved the British abolition of the slave trade . Missing from this top hundred was church growth in modern Africa , where the number of Christians increased , staggeringly , from 10 million in 1900 to 360 million by 2000 . Nor were there any Southerners among the same publication 's list of the ten most important Christians of the passing century . ( In fairness , the list did include two African Americans , Martin Luther King Jr . and Pentecostal pioneer William Seymour . ) An evangelical-oriented survey of 100 Christian Books That Changed the Century featured three or four books about missions in Africa and Asia , but scarcely a word about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer was Cry the Beloved Country , by White South African Alan Paton. // The imbalance is just as evident in the Western academic world , in which published studies of Third World religion represent only a tiny fraction of scholarship on Christianity . At the same time , the volume of academic studies coming out of Africa and Latin America has shrunk as universities in those regions have been crippled by lack of resources . To quote John Mbiti once more , " It is utterly scandalous for so many Christian scholars in the old Christendom to know so much about heretical movements in the second and third centuries , when so few of them know anything about Christian movements in areas of the younger churches . " Matters have changed somewhat since Mbiti wrote in the 1970s . Some excellent books are now available on Southern religion , notably Harvey Cox 's influential Fire from Heaven ( 1995 ) , and we have some fine studies on Latin American Pentecostalism . But the general observation about what most Western religious studies scholars actually work on is still applicable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wishes to undertake serious study of Christianity these days needs to know something about Africa , " it scarcely reflects common scholarly perceptions . // If most writers are neglecting the present-day realities of Christianity , they are still worse on projecting the future . In North America at least , most visions of the coming century are based firmly on extrapolating familiar domestic conditions . The imagined future looks a lot like the American present , only with Western liberalism ever more in the ascendant . Robert Wuthnow 's Christianity in the 21st Century has basically nothing to say about conditions in the Third World . There is only a little more in a book with the promising title Toward 2015 : A Church Odyssey , although one of its co-authors is an Episcopal bishop . Not even Anglicans and Episcopalians are looking South , although that is where virtually all of the growth is occurring in their Communion . // If the religious world , the old Christendom , is so cavalier about these epoch-making changes , it is not surprising that secular commentators are largely oblivious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of just what Western civilization means when what were once its critical religious aspects are now primarily upheld outside the " West . " One key exception is Samuel P. Huntington 's book , The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order , one of the most widely read analyses of current global trends , which does pay serious attention to changing religious patterns . Even Huntington , though , understates the rising force of Christianity . He believes that the relative Christian share of global population will fall steeply in the new century , and that this religion will be supplanted by Islam : " In the long run ... Muhammad wins out . " But far from Islam being the world 's largest religion by 2020 or so , as Huntington suggests , Christianity will still have a massive lead , and will maintain its position into the foreseeable future . By 2050 , there should still be about three Christians for every two Muslims worldwide . Some 34 percent of the world 's people will then be Christian , roughly what the figure was at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis of the evidence is misguided in one crucial respect . While he rightly notes the phenomenal rates of population growth in Muslim countries , he ignores the fact that similar or even higher rates are also found in already populous Christian countries , above all in Africa . Alongside the Muslim efflorescence he rightly foresees , there will also be a Christian population explosion , often in the same or adjacent countries . If we look at the nations with the fastest population growth and the youngest populations , they are evenly distributed between Christian- and Muslim-dominated societies . I dispute Huntington 's assertion that " Christianity spreads primarily by conversion , Islam by conversion and reproduction . " Huntington 's lack of interest in the epoch-making Christian growth in Africa is odd because elsewhere he has written so knowledgeably about the role of the Catholic Church in promoting democratic movements across the continent . Throughout his Clash of Civilizations , though , he refers to " Western Christianity " as if there could be no other species . The same kind of tunnel vision affects another recent work on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For Barber , Third World religion is discussed chiefly in terms of Islam , and Christianity just means North American fundamentalism . There is no recognition that the gravest challenge to " McWorld " might not come from Jihad , but rather from what we might call the forces of Crusade , from the Christian Third World . // BACK TO THE FUTURE // The numerical changes in Christianity are striking enough , but beyond the simple demographic transition , there are countless implications for theology and religious practice . To take a historical parallel , Christianity changed thoroughly when a movement founded in a Jewish and Hellenistic context moved into the Germanic lands of Western Europe during the early Middle Ages . Although it is only a symbolic example , we can learn something from the way in which the English language imported its large Christian vocabulary . Familiar words like " church " or " bishop " are borrowed from Greek originals , although in radically mutated forms . " Church " derives from kyriakos oikos ( house of the Lord ) , " bishop " from episkopos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community ) . We can imagine the Roman and Greek missionaries to the Anglo-Saxons confronting the notorious English incapacity to deal with foreign tongues , and hearing their elegant terms butchered into the words we have today . // In this instance , the substance of the words survived the cultural transition intact , but in other vital ways , a largely urban Mediterranean Christianity was profoundly changed by the move to the Northern forests . In art and popular thought , Jesus became a blond Aryan , often with the appropriate warrior attributes , and Christian theology was reshaped by West European notions of law and feudalism . European Christians reinterpreted the faith through their own concepts of social and gender relations , and then imagined that their culturally specific synthesis was the only correct version of Christian truth . In fact , it was about as far removed from its origins as the word " church " is from kyriakos oikos . As Christianity moves southward , the religion will be comparably changed by immersion in the prevailing cultures of those host societies . // But what would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that at least for the foreseeable future , members of a Southern-dominated church are likely to be among the poorer people on the planet , in marked contrast to the older Western-dominated world . For this reason , some Western Christians have since the 1960s expected that the religion of their Third World brethren would be fervently liberal , activist , and even revolutionary , the model represented by liberation theology . In this view , the new Christianity would chiefly be concerned with putting down the mighty from their seats , through political action or even armed struggle . All too often , though , these hopes have proved illusory . Frequently , the liberationist voices emanating from the Third World proved to derive from clerics trained in Europe and North America , and their ideas won only limited local appeal . Southern Hemisphere Christians would not avoid political activism , but they would become involved strictly on their own terms . // ( Continues ... ) //
