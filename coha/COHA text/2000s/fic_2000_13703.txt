( We hear the sound of the wind , as the lights come up on ISABEL , who is discovered behind the scrim-like sail of a 19th Century merchant ship . SHE is holding a small box with a lid.In front of the sail sits JOSLITO , a young JOS MARIA , with one arm and one leg strapped to the mast of a merchant ship in San Juan Harbor , 1872 . HE speaks to the wind which is flapping the sails all around him.As ISABEL lifts the lid off the box , JOSLITO begins to speak  --  it is as if by opening the box , ISABEL is able to release his voice into the air . As JOSLITO continues to speak , ISABEL holds the box up to the sky and slowly fades from view. ) p. 3 JOS&amp;EACUTE ; LITO If I promise to introduce you to the South wind , will you loosen my ropes ?

And I said " No , Don Pemplin , I will try to find my mother . " He tells me she is dead , but I do n't believe it . I feel her still . I can smell her sometimes in the cool breeze that pulls the sweat away from my eyes . She keeps me from growing blind with my own salt . She keeps my eyes open so I can keep watch for her .

ANA CECILIA ( A softer tone ) That 's because you had nothing until you met me . It 's easy to remember the only good thing in your miserable life .

I think I once had a pair of shoes that were justDo you remember my aunt Eusebia ? She gave me a pair of brown leather shoes with ribbons to tie them closed . I loved those shoes .

I did n't notice it until it was high tide and I saw the waves cover over where I had walked earlier that day . I cupped my hand , scooped up a piece of the sea and placed my lips on it  --  so I could say good-bye finally to those old ribbons and those old shoes . It 's easier to say good-bye when you do it through water . When your lips are moist with the taste of salt . That 's why people cry I think . I think it 's because they need to fill their senses with the taste of sadness . It 's not enough to feel a tear roll down your face . You have to taste it and swallow it down so your insides know your sadness too .

That 's what friends do . And I did not call you ugly . I think you 're beautiful . SHARON You do ? ISABEL Yeah . But I 'm a bad friend so what does it matter what I think ? SHARON I never said you were a bad friend . You just say hurtful things sometimes . ISABEL I do n't mean to . Things just come out of my mouth wrong .

Isa , I saw eca and Flaca yesterday and they said it 's okay to kiss Black boys , but you should stop hanging around with Black girls because if they touch your hair it gets nappy like theirs is . And you start to smell funny too . p. 15 ISABEL You 're too old to be so ignorant . SHARON So you can have a Black boyfriend , but you ca n't play with Black girls ? ISABEL And you can get pregnant and have a Black baby , but if it 's a girl , you ca n't comb her hair ? DOLORES Did I say that ? ! What does being pregnant have to do with anything anyways ?

( Pause ; looking back and forth between herself and Isabel . ) Do you think maybe we 're too old for costumes ? ISABEL Maybe . ( Pulling off her own wig ) I never liked trick-or-treating anyway . But I do like the costumes . SHARON That 's because you 're gon na be an actress  --  ( Breaking out into a song from Lerner &amp; Lowe 's My Fair Lady . ) " You 'll be broke and I 'll have money , Ah , ha , ha , wo n't that be funny !

Then SHARON &amp; ISABEL survey each other and hiss like vampires in unison , throwing their heads back and showing their fangs . ) SHARON ( In a Dracula-type accent ) Vant to come over to my house later and play Parcheesi ? ISABEL ( Also in a Transylvanian accent ) Ve have n't done that in a long time . ( ISABEL &amp; SHARON laugh . SHARON is the first to sober up . ) SHARON It wo n't be the same . Junie used to whup us at Parcheesi . ISABEL Yep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pain in the butt , but I miss him now .

In the apartment , ANA CECILIA sleeps as JOS MARIA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaks . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; If I stare at you while you sleep , will you dream of me ? ( Pause ) You look so peaceful . Women are like the sails of a great ship , they can bring you to amazing places you would never find otherwise . Otherwise , you could only travel as far as your arms could take you . And you ca n't row to the really important places . No , to get to those places you must sail . And a good sail is tightly woven , with no rips or tears , but tightened onto the mast by years of feeling the heat of the sun and the mist of the sea . ( Pause ) I wonder if you can feel my eyes on you , and if you do , if they make you feel safe ( Tying one of his arms to one of hers ) Now I can sleep too .

IAN picks at his afro as HE speaks . IAN Why does it bother you so much ? ISABEL I do n't know  --  men are n't supposed to be so concerned with their hair . But you pick and pick and pick . It makes me forget what I was saying . You hypnotize me with all that picking . IAN I got ta take care of my hair . It gets too nappy if I do n't and then I do n't look good . I need to look good for my baby , do n't I ? ( Pulling ISABEL to him affectionately ) Do n't I ? ISABEL Yeah . You look good . Hey , Ian , do you wan na come in and meet my great-grandparents ? IAN No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just grandparents  --  great-grandparents . I bet you do n't got any of those . IAN Oooh , I bet they smell like shoes in an old trunk . Are they still walking around ? ISABEL Yeah  --  slowly , but surely . IAN I do n't wan na ever be that old . My grandpa is in a wheelchair  --  and he lost all his hair except this white ring that goes all around his little ole pea head . Man , does he look nasty . p. 22 ISABEL I ca n't wait to get that old . Then you can stop worrying about everything . So what if you have a ring around your head ? ! I have daydreams about being that free . IAN Oh , yeah ? Well , I have nightmares . Just last night , I had a dream that I was real old like that and I could n't find my way back to my house .

At first , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that being lost just felt like being dead  --  like you disappear for a while until you find your way . I just kept telling myself that if I kept moving forward I would find my way back home because the Earth is a circle . Then I woke up and I had wrapped my sheets all around my body in a knot  --  like I had tied myself to the bed . What do you think that means ? ISABEL I think it means you ca n't escape from yourself . Like you were searching all over but only to come back to the same place . IAN HmmmI think it just means that I 'm going to lose my hair one day . ISABEL Ay ! You and your hair ! Dag ! ( Looking up at the Sotillo 's apartment window ) I hope I get old the way Papabuelo did . He does n't tell the same story over and over like most boring old people .

I bet she wo n't say nut'ing to nobody for a long time . I hit her right in the mouth . ( Playing out the scene into the mirror ) My fists were like bop , bop , bop . I bonked her like a car horn .

My stomach fills up with tears sometimes and makes me feel like throwing up  --  but I do n't tell Ma because she would start thinking I 'm dying or something . She watches me all the time now like I might . ( Pause ) She makes me want to disappear sometimes . I ca n't stand her eyes on me all the time . Most days I stay out until I know she 's asleep . So I do n't have to see her eyes looking at me , but really looking for Junie . I wo n't ever be him . ( SHE gets on tiptoes to kiss the image of Tito .

It startles ISABEL . ISABEL Wow ! That 's service . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; It took you a long time to get here . Your mother called to say you 'd be here an hour ago . ISABEL Oh . Did she ? I guess she was wrong . I 'm here now anyway . Dag ! She watches me like a hawk . I wish she trusted me more . She gets on my last nerve .

JOS&amp;EACUTE ; When I was just a little baby , my mother was forced to leave me in Puerto Rico and go to work on a sugar plantation in Cuba . ISABEL Do you remember her ? JOS&amp;EACUTE ; I only really remember her smell , I think . Like the loose dirt around a newly dug garden  --  sort of like flowers but more like the earth . And I remember who I imagined she was . I heard many stories about her . p. 27 ISABEL What was her name ? JOS&amp;EACUTE ; She was called Medianoche , because she was so Black that she looked like the middle of the night . Nothing could be better than to be so dark that you became a part of the nightthat 's what I thought when I was a young boy anyway . ISABEL Sounds like an insult to me .

Though I knew that the blacker you were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at you . Maybe it was because it was my mother 's name that I could n't imagine anything bad about it . ISABEL I have the opposite problem . I only think of bad things people might be trying to do to me . I do n't trust nobody . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Even me ? ISABEL You know what I mean . Other people . Them . People who call us things . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; People call you things ? Like what ?

And the man who used to run the grocery store . And the bus driver on the bus going to school . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Those are n't good people . ISABEL Of course not . But it 's no big deal .

ISABEL Who told you I had a boyfriend ? Ma ? She bothers me about everything . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; I saw him walk you over here . ISABEL You could tell just from his walk ? JOS&amp;EACUTE ; I could tell from how he watched you walk  --  into the building . Men 's eyes linger on the women they love . ISABEL Dad does n't look at Ma like that . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Hmmmhe just does n't do it when he knows you 're watching . ISABEL Sharon says I stare too much . Makes people uncomfortable . But how else can you learn about people , except by staring and recording it in your brain . p. 29 JOS&amp;EACUTE ; You could listen too , Isabel . ISABEL I listen  --  most of the time . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Sharon 's a wise young lady . How come you do n't bring her by anymore ? ISABEL She 's never around when I come over here  --  always out walking around and thinking too much . She even passes by me sometimes  --  looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; She uses her eyes like a blind person uses his fingers . ISABEL Yeah .

I wan na go around the world one day  --  like my Uncle did . He 's been everywhere . Places where they never even seen Black folks before . He told me that was the best , ' cause then nobody tried to tell him how to act because they was n't afraid of him . It was more like he was special than different . You know what I mean ? DOLORES I know exactly what you mean . ( ISABEL strides up to them . IAN nervously pulls at his afro with a pick when HE sees her. ) p. 31 ISABEL So what is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be a boba ! I was just telling Ian about my church and stuff . ISABEL Right . And stuff . C'm on . My Papabuelo 's waiting . DOLORES Can I come too ? ISABEL No . DOLORES Call me , if you wan na go to church , Ian . IAN Okay . Alright . So long . ( DOLORES exits . ) ISABEL That girl wants everything I got . Bitch . C'm on . ( IAN &amp; ISABEL go to stand outside her great-grandparents front door . ) Can you hurry up ! He 's waiting . IAN Cool it ! I do n't get along with old dudes . ISABEL He 's not no old dude  --  he 's my great-grandfather  --  and you got ta get along wif him . IAN Or what ? ISABEL I di n't say or nuffin . I 'm just saying . It 's important . IAN The things you got ta do for a chick , man . ISABEL You watch too much Mod Squad . Talk regular in front of them , okay ? p. 32 IAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushes him away . ) ISABEL Are you crazy ? ! They 'll see us . IAN Through the door ? What ? ! They got x-ray vision or something ? ISABEL Just  --  just act normal okay ? IAN I 'll try . ( ISABEL knocks on the door . ANA CECILIA answers . ) ANA CECILIA Yes ? What do you want ISABEL This is Ian Durant , Mamabuela . He wanted to meet you . ANA CECILIA Are you a nurse ? ISABEL No . I 'm Isabel . ANA CECILIA Then go away . ( ANA CECILIA tries to close the door but ISABEL puts her foot in it preventing it from closing . ) ISABEL Mamabuela ! Do n't you recognize me ? ! ANA CECILIA HmmmYou look a little like the lady who comes to clean the house every week . ISABEL That 's my mother  --  Carmen . The wife of Candido , your son 's son . ANA CECILIA Son Son . What 's that ? Chinese ? Go away , ChinChon . ( JOSE MARIA appears behind ANA CECILIA. ) p. 33 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANA CECILIA Why ? They did n't bring my medicine , did they ? ( Throwing the door wide open ) Alright ! Come in ! Everybody ! Just come to my door and knock and I 'll let you in like you 're family and you 'll rob me blind . ISABEL I am family , Mamabuela . ANA CECILIA Humph ! ( ANA CECILIA goes to a chair and sits in it deliberately closing her eyes tight . SHE moves her lips , silently mocking IAN &amp; JOS MARIA . ) JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Come on in , children . IAN ( Approaching JOS MARIA with hand extended ) Happy to meet you , sir . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; ( Imitating IAN 's serious manly tone , as HE shakes IAN 's hand ) And I to meet you , young man . Sit . ( ISABEL &amp; IAN sit on the floor at JOS MARIA 's feet . There is no other place to sit since ANA CECILIA is blocking as much of the sitting area as possible . Long , awkward silence as JOS MARIA surveys IAN . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . IAN Uhm , yeah . " My Fair Lady . " It 's a musical . p. 34 JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Oh , that 's nice . Are you the star ? ISABEL I 'm the star . IAN I thought it was more like we both were the star . ISABEL Really ? It 's not called My Fair People is it ? Or My Fair Couple ? IAN ( With a laugh ) No , I guess not . Anyway , we both have pretty big roles  --  hers is the biggest , of course . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Isabelita , how come you did n't tell me that you were THE My Fair Lady ? ISABEL I do n't know . You did n't ask me . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; I 'm asking now . You know it 's hard for me to get out of the house these days , so why do n't you do a piece of it for me now ? I would love to hear you . ISABEL Really ? Well , okay , I mean , what do you think , Ian ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . ISABEL The part you keep forgetting would be good . IAN ( Embarrassed ) Yeahit would . ( IAN &amp; ISABEL act out a scene from MY FAIR LADY , the middle of Act 2 , Sc . 1 , for JOS MARIA &amp; ANA CECILIA . ANA CECILIA gets increasingly agitated as SHE listens . IAN plays Henry Higgins and ISABEL plays Eliza Doolittle . ELIZA/ISABEL mimes throwing slippers at HIGGINS/IAN. ) p. 35 ELIZA/ISABEL There are your slippers ! And there ! Take your slippers , Professor Higgins , and may you never have a day 's luck with them ! HIGGINS/IAN ( Astounded ) What on earth ? ( HE comes to her . ) What 's the matter ? Is anything wrong ? ANA CECILIA ( To JOS MARIA ) Are they Koo-Koo ? ? I do n't see any slippers . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Ssssh ! Ana , please . ELIZA/ISABEL ( Seething ) Nothing wrong  --  with you . I 've won your bet for you , have n't I ? That 's enough for you . I do n't matter , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presumptuous insect . I won it ! What did you throw those slippers at me for ? ELIZA/ISABEL Because I wanted to smash your face . I 'd like to kill you , you selfish brute . Why did n't you leave me where you picked me out of  --  the gutter ? You thank God it 's all over , and that now you can throw me back again there , do you ? ANA CECILIA ( To JOS MARIA ) That 's where I 'd like to throw you  --  Placata ! Back to the gutter . Did you write this story ? HIGGINS/IAN ( Trying to stay calm ) So the creature is nervous , after all ? ( ELIZA/ISABEL gives a suffocated scream of fury and instinctively darts her nails in his face . HIGGINS/IAN catches her wrists . ) Ah ! Claws in you , you cat ! How dare you show your temper to me ? p. 36 ANA CECILIA ( Over IAN 's following action ) Ah , Hah ! Eso ! Poohn ! Poohng ! As ! HIGGINS/IAN ( HE throws her roughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lap . ) Sit down and be quiet . ( ANA CECILIA pushes IAN to the floor . ) ISABEL Mamabuela ! ( ISABEL rushed to help him up . IAN immediately checks his hair then takes out his pick and starts picking . ) IAN Did I get flat in the back ? ? It feels all flat now . Dag ! ISABEL You look fine . ANA CECILIA Do n't push any woman around in this house , Higgins . ISABEL It was n't for real , mamabuela . ANA CECILIA ( Pushing ISABEL back down on the couch ) I know  --  I know what 's real ! ISABEL So you were trying to protect me ? ANA CECILIA Ay ! I do n't know ! Stop asking questions and get rid of this  --  JOS&amp;EACUTE ; He 's a nice boy , Ana . Do n't get yourself so excited . p. 37 ANA CECILIA They were the ones screaming about stupid things . Screaming ! ME CAGO EN LA LECHE DE " THOSE SLIPPERS ! " JOS&amp;EACUTE ; You better go children . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next time . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; ( As IAN and ISABEL move to the door . ) Maybe you can come back later . ANA CECILIA No , they ca n't . We still have to do our shopping that we did n't do yesterday . Hurry up and put on your shoes old man . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; ( As ISABEL rushed IAN out the door ) Nice meeting you . I liked your play . ANA CECILIA It was caca . That play was caca . You hear me ? Like big fat mohones , floating in the toilet . Just like that . Oooey ! Que porquera ! ( Watching him ) Well ? Are n't you going to get dressed ? It 's fascinating how slow you are . You move like you 're underwater . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Sometimes I feel like I am . ( THEY look at their front door as it goes from day to night . Lights cross to SHARON sitting alone at the Pizza Parlor. ) p. 38 Act 1 , Scene 7 : Messed-up Girl SCENE 7 " Messed-up Girl " SHARON , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parlor for ISABEL to arrive . SHE puts money in the jukebox and plays " Just My Imagination " by The Temptations . As SHE moves away from the jukebox , DOLORES enters . DOLORES Who you waiting for , Sharoni ? SHARON Do n't call me that . DOLORES Ooh , chile ! I like your hair . Who straightens it for you ? Doa Paca does mine , but she always burns my scalp . She says I got such bad hair that she has to burn it to make it better . SHARON You need to go away . DOLORES It 's a free country . I can eat pizza , if I want to . ( DOLORES eats her pizza in silence , as SHARON watches the door . ) Sohow 's your brother . He 's a fine looking boy . If I was younger , ooh , chile , watch out ! I 'd be right there  --  SHARON He 's dead , Dolores . He died like a year ago . I 'm on my way to the church now for a memorial service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought he was still in the hospital . That 's a shame . How old was he ? p. 39 SHARON Eleven . ( DOLORES continues to eat in silence , SHARON gets up . ) I guess it 's time to go . I thought maybe I 'd see Isabel . DOLORES Why did n't you call her ? SHARON They cut off our phone because Ma keeps forgetting to pay . She forgets everything now . DOLORES You do n't have a lot of money , huh ? I could ask my stepdad to give you some . If I do n't tell my mom  --  he gives me stuff . And his job is paying good now after the strike . SHARON We got enough . DOLORES You looking so skinny too . Why do n't you have some pizza ? I 'll buy you a slice . SHARON I 'm not hungry . DOLORES Then why did you come to a pizza parlor ? SHARON Have you seen Isabel or not ? ! DOLORES I saw her after school . She went over to her grandpa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two are getting disgusting . You want me to go with you ? SHARON No . DOLORES I wan na go . Pay my respects and all . SHARON You did n't even know he was dead . ( DOLORES suddenly runs over to SHARON and hugs her . SHARON lets herself be hugged , fighting tears. ) p. 40 DOLORES Please , can I go ? SHARON ( Pushing her away ) Get off me . Why would you want to go anyway ? You 're not my friend . DOLORES Yeahthat 's true . ( Pause ; Pondering this ) I do n't know . I like churches . They always got a good smell to them . And I like to pray . Like when I feel that pressure on my knees and I think I ca n't stay that way any longer ? That 's when I feel God inside me . My Ma taught me that  --  that when it starts to hurt like that  --  ooh , chile , that 's a good feeling . SHARON That 's messed up , girl . ( DOLORES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away  --  more gently this time . ) Okay . But do n't hug me anymore . It 's hard enough , okay ? ( THEY exit together . DOLORES moves to take SHARON 's arm , but thinks better of it , keeping a respectful distance instead . ) DOLORES Okay . ( Pause ) I like when people hug me  --  when I 'm sad I mean . There 's nothing wrong with touching people . ( Pause ; SHARON sighs ) I guess it depends though  --  how they touch you . ( SHARON starts to run . ) Hey , wait up . ( SHARON falls to her knees ) Hey , your dress . You 'll get all dirty . Get up . Do n't do that ! ( DOLORES tries to get SHARON up as the lights cross to JOSLITO on the deck of a ship. ) p. 41 Act 1 , Scene 8 : Blood Runs SCENE 8 " Blood Runs " 1873 . Dawn . JOSLITO on his knees on the deck of a ship , which HE is cleaning with a cloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind . As HE speaks , a light slowly comes up on JOS MARIA looking out his kitchen window recalling this memory . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; LITO Do n't do that ! Do n't make me think so much . Every time you come to me before a storm , I have this memory of my mother . On her knees . Begging to take me with her . But I do n't know if it 's real . It 's a memory that 's like a dream now . I used to dream of my father until I understood that a Spaniard had forced himself on her . That 's how I came into this world . I have two souls . The gentle one my mother gave me and the one an animal forced on us both . My father is someone I think of when I see animals get slaughtered . When blood runs from warm flesh into the soil under it , I think of him.Sometimes I cut into my skin with seashells just to see that blood and remember . It always surprises me too  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been drained out yet ? " I wonder . ( Pause ) How could any man do that ? ( Pause ; the next line is said in unison with JOS MARIA . ) JOS&amp;EACUTE ; LITO &amp; JOS&amp;EACUTE ; MARIA And what does that make me ? ( Lights on the past fade as the Sotillo apartment is filled with morning light. ) p. 42 Act 1 , Scene 9 : Que Triste Pasas SCENE 9 " Que Triste Pasas " Morning . ANA CECILIA &amp; JOS MARIA try to have breakfast . JOS MARIA sits at the kitchen table , his right leg up on a chair . ANA CECILIA sits with her head down , staring at the plate but not seeing it . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Nothing ? You have to eat something , my love . ( ANA CECILIA does not look up ; Playfully ) If I feed you , like the queen that you are , will you eat then ? ANA CECILIA If you try to put a spoon near my mouth , I will bite your hand through to the bone and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me off you . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Maybe you 're just not hungry . Today is just one of your bad days . You 'll feel better soon . Soon the dreams will go away , Ana . ANA CECILIA I woke up with the taste of his dirty fingers on my tongue , in the moist corners of my eyes . I woke up breathing him . Did you see my sheets ? ? Soiled . Because of him . It does n't go away , Jos . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; You have to let me take you to the doctor . You 're making yourself sick with  --  ANA CECILIA Why ca n't you stop talking ? Most people need some silence , but not you . You will talk all night if I let you . Even if I never say one word back . Blah , blah , blah . On and on . Do you really have anything important to say , old man ? I ca n't believe you do . I , on the other hand , have so much to say . And I choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Because I appreciate silence . That 's a sign of good breeding . I was raised to be a lady . Not like you , Seorito . No . When you were a boy , you were tied to a piece of iron . That 's what my father said . You had a piece of iron tied around your neck and you carried it where ever you went so you could n't get anywhere fast and you could n't swim away . Do you remember that piece of metal ? p. 43 ANA CECILIA I wish I had one for your tongue so that I could lock your mouth so you would only speak when I let you . And I would only let you , if I thought you had something to say . And you would only have something to say if were quiet for a very long time . That 's the only way to learn to value speech . You see , these are things only I can understand  --  not you . Not ever . ( Pause ) Your food makes me sick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes me sick because you cooked it  --  your hands touched that . Your hands are n't human . They 're like his hands . You are not a man to me , seorito . You are this . ( Spitting into the bowl of food in front of her . ) Like nothing . Like my dusty-smelling mouth . This desert you made when you did n't save me . You even turned my spit into sand . ( JOS MARIA begins to cry quietly . ) Look at that ! Did I make you feel something ? You can never feel as much as me . ( ANA CECILIA gets up and goes to the bedroom . From the bedroom , we hear her sing " Noche de Ronda " by Agustin Lara . ) " Noche de ronda que triste pasas , que triste cruzas , por mi balcn . Noche de ronda cmo me hieres cmo lastimas mi corazn . Luna que se quiebra , Sobre la tiniebla de mi soledad , A dnde vas ? Dime si esta noche t te vas de ronda como ella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARIA joins in making the song an oddly tragic duet. ) p. 44 JOS&amp;EACUTE ; MARIA &amp; ANA CECILIA " Dile que la quiero , dile que me muero de tanto esperar que vuelva ya , que las rondas no son buenas , que hacen dao , que dan penas y que acaban por llorar . " ANA CECILIA ( A different , gentler person ; a transformation ; all is forgotten for a moment ) That is such a beautiful song . People do n't sing songs like that anymore . ( Crosses over to her place at the table and begins to eat . JOS MARIA begins to eat too , cautiously watching her for signs of an explosion which does not come . ) This soup needs more pepper . ( JOS MARIA hands her the pepper shaker in silence . ) You 'll have to get more pepper . We 're almost out . ( JOS puts his spoon down and moves gingerly away from the table . It is difficult for him so we can tell HE is in physical pain . ) ANA CECILIA You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swollen  --  then you wo n't be able to stop it from hurting . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; It 's too late for that , I think . ( Lights cross to the Pizza Parlor later that afternoon. ) p. 45 Act 1 , Scene 10 : The Serious Answer SCENE 10 " The Serious Answer " Late afternoon . ISABEL &amp; IAN slow dance in the pizza parlor to the song playing on the jukebox . It is " Thin Line Between Love and Hate " by The Persuaders . THEY wear their My Fair Lady costumes . ISABEL looks bloodied and bruised . IAN looks slightly ruffled , while ISABEL 's shirt is badly torn . ISABEL I tried to get all the blood off but I could n't . ( THEY continue to dance in silence . ) I love dancing with you . IAN Yeah ? Me too . ISABEL Do you love me ? IAN Maybe . ISABEL If you , me and your mother was in a boat and it started to sink , who would you save ? IAN Myself . How about you ? ISABEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer . ISABEL I guess I did . Do n't I always ? ( Pause ) How many more times do you think they 'll beat me up ? IAN It wo n't happen again . I 'm going to talk to them . p. 46 ISABEL Well that should do it . IAN Do n't take an attitude with me . ( Silence ) Are you okay ? ISABEL Yeah . IAN If I'da gotten there sooner , this would n't have happened . ISABEL Yeah . You woulda probably gotten us killed with your bad temper . IAN ( With a mischievous smile ) That 's not all I got that 's bad . ISABEL Man , you are so stupid . ( IAN holds her a little closer as THEY continue to dance in silence . ) ISABEL I tell you what was bad  --  us  --  in that play tonight . IAN I thought we were good . ISABEL No , uhuhn . Forgot almost all the lines . I think between us we wrote a whole new thing . IAN Made it better , probably . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Papabuelo . ( Pause ) What am I gon na do ? If I tell my dad I got beat up again , he 's gon na send me to Puerto Rico for sure . He already said he wants me to go there over Christmas . p. 47 IAN I bet it 's beautiful there . ISABEL You want me to go ? IAN I did n't say that . ISABEL Are you going out with Dolores now ? IAN No . ISABEL I just got beat up for you . IAN I know . I 'm sorry . ISABEL What am I gon na tell my mother ? Will you come wif me ? IAN Uhnuhh . I met enough of your family . I got ta go . ISABEL Are n't you even gon na walk me home ? What  --  are you embarrassed now to be wif me ? You think we 'll get beat up ? Scared it might muss up your hair ? IAN Do n't be stupid . Isabel . Of course , I 'll walk you home  --  if you want . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't do me any favors . Maybe you should go find Dolores and she can exercise her mouth on you . IAN Maybe so . Do n't say things you ca n't take back . ( ISABEL tries to run off . IAN grabs her by the arm . ) Do n't run away from me like that ! ( ISABEL pulls herself free and exits . ) Why are you doing this , Isabel ? That 's it . I 'm gon na start dating Black chicks . Like Line says " Never put too much cream in your coffee , sons of Africa , or pretty soon you 'll be having milk . ' Nuff said , all done . " ( Lights cross to Scene 11 in various locations. ) p. 48 p. 49 Act 1 , Scene 11 : Aleluya SCENE 11 " Aleluya " A snowstorm . Night . ISABEL tries to rinse the blood off her dress in a sink . DOLORES sits on the stoop watching for rats . SHARON walks along the street kicking up snow as SHE goes . JOS MARIA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paces on the dock . ANA CECILIA tries on various pieces of clothing , checking herself out in the mirror . Each person is caught in a pool of light as he or she speaks . At times , the ensemble may react physically to what another character is saying , i.e. If a character mentions their hands , perhaps the other characters will find a reason to touch their own hands  --  a sublimal suggestion to link all the characters psychically . This scene should feel like a dance . ISABEL ( As SHE tries to wash the blood off her clothes ) I do n't mind the blood , but it 's when they spit on me that I wanned to throw up . You can scrub and scrub and never get those stains out . If you get hit hard enough , you bleed . But when someone hates you enough to spit at you , it burns into your skin  --  like a mark you ca n't ever erase . Papabuelo has marks like that . ( Pause ) This blood 's not coming off . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rats with a piece of wood from a broken old shelf . The rats are running back and forth from the garbage to the stoop of the Sotillo apartment . Her mouth is bleeding. ) p. 50 DOLORES Come back here ! I wan na kill you ! You dirty , juicy things . Why do you have such big ole fat juicy tails ? They look like my fingers . Chasing around in the garbage . ' Cept , I ai n't no garbage-picker . Nuhuhh . ( Hitting a big rat , smashing it , and then talking to it ) Got you , chubby ! ( SHE scrapes the rat into a shoebox and looks into it like it is a coffin . SHE crosses herself . Lights cross to the Sotillo apartment . JOS MARIA sits by the kitchen window , with a blanket draped around his shoulders , as ANA CECILIA speaks from her bedroom . ) ANA CECILIA ( Beginning to undress ; watching herself in the mirror ) Hepa ! Looking pretty good  --  pero ese viejo . Olvidat ! I forget how old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courtship scene from 1889 in her head , SHE sees JOS MARIA tying ropes into nautical knots and arranging them neatly on the ground on a dock in San Juan . ) Look who 's here . I expect to see rats hiding by the boats  --  but it 's Seorito Jos . ( Lights cross to a dock in San Juan Harbor . 1873 . JOSLITO is looking at his hands . HE stands on the dock , looking at the ship HE was once a slave on . JOS MARIA looks out the window as JOSLITO speaks . ) JOS&amp;EACUTE ; LITO I do n't know why I came back . If I 'm free now , I could go anywhere . But instead ( Pause ) All I know is this boatAnd the stars to guide her with . ( Lights cross back to DOLORES . Unable to contain her excitement , DOLORES looks up at the Sotillo window , sees Papabuelo there and holds the rat up so he can see. ) p. 51 DOLORES There he is ! They say he 's old  --  like people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing in the window ? He 's gon na catch a cold that way  --  but maybe he do n't catch colds ' cause he do n't go nowheres no more . Now they say he used to love picking in the garbage  --  jus'like you . That 's where they got all they furniture . Mmmhmm . I hate old people . What are they still here for ? Somebody needs to jus'put'em in a box and close the top . ( Lights cross to JOS MARIA &amp; ANA CECILIA in ANA 's memory from 1889 . ) JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Seorita Ana , what are you doing out in this heat ? Are n't you afraid of burning that beautiful skin ? ANA CECILIA I do n't burn , I simmer . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; ( Slightly shocked by her blatant flirtation ) Seorita ! I 'm sure I do n't know what you mean . ANA CECILIA Are you turning red for me , Seorito ? JOS&amp;EACUTE ; I have to get back to work . ANA CECILIA ( Lifting up her skirt to above her ankles ) Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit me as I walked over here through the sugarcane . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; That 's quite a walk . There 's not a lot of sugar cane in San Juan . ( Taking a quick , shy glance ) Looks like a mosquito . Make a paste with a little salt and water . That 'll bring down the swelling . p. 52 ANA CECILIA ( Trying to be innocent but not really succeeding ) Ohis that how you bring it down ? ( Lights cross to DOLORES . ) DOLORES And he 's always going around telling all those dumb stories . And then Isabel thinks she 's slick with all them stories . I got stories too . But she wo n't listen to mine . Maybe I 'll tell one to you , chubby ( Lights cross back to JOS MARIA &amp; ANA CECILIA . ) JOS&amp;EACUTE ; So what do you really want , Seorita Ana ? ANA CECILIA I want you to kiss me . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Do you ? Why ? I know your father warned you about men  --  like me . ANA CECILIA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; There are some who would like to see me dead for kissing a young girl like you . ANA CECILIA Yes . Exciting , is n't it ? But I think I would be in trouble too . ( Lights cross to JOSLITO in 1873 . ) JOS&amp;EACUTE ; LITO You can see the sky best from the deck of a ship as it cuts through the darkest part of the night . ( Lights cross back to JOS MARIA &amp; ANA CECILIA in 1889. ) p. 53 JOS&amp;EACUTE ; And you think a kiss from me is  --  ANA CECILIA Worth it . I 'm sure of that . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Do n't you think I 'm a little old for you ? ANA CECILIA I do n't like boys my age . They are so immature . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; ( Holds out his hand and indicates his skin . ) And this ? ( Lights cross to ISABEL still trying to get the bloodstains out. ) pp. 60 missing ISABEL Why do people have so much blood anyway ? If I did n't have blood , would those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see how much they were hurting me , maybe they would just go away . People like them like seeing all that red . Then they feel like they 're better than you , because they kept their own stuff inside . Papabuelo once told me that it 's good to bleed sometimes , because it lets the air in  --  so you remember to breathe . ( Pause ) Maybe he can help me remember . ( Lights cross back to JOS MARIA and ANA CECILIA , still in ANA CECILIA 's memory from 1889 . ) ANA CECILIA ( Touching his fingertips with hers ) You have the most beautiful hands I 've ever seen . Each finger so strong and straight . I thought you would have calluses on your hands from pulling on so many ropes , but  --  p. 54 JOS&amp;EACUTE ; You 've been watching me work on the ship ? ANA CECILIA NoOnly a few  --  maybe five timesI happened by . ( Lights cross back to DOLORES . ) DOLORES My stepfather does n't let me tell any stories . He says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't let me go out  --  but I do n't lie . I do n't ever lie . I do n't ever , ever lie . ( Lights cross back to JOSLITO in 1873 . ) JOS&amp;EACUTE ; LITO Even when the air is still , the feeling of that stillness on your face lifts your eyes toward the starlight . ( Lights cross back to JOS MARIA &amp; ANA CECILIA still in ANA CECILIA 's memory from 1889 . ) ANA CECILIA Kiss me . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; No . Not until you know what you 're doing . ANA CECILIA I know . ( SHE suddenly jumps up and kisses him quickly on the lips . ) You see ? JOS&amp;EACUTE ; ( Gently pushing her away ) That only proves that you know nothing about me . To me a kiss is a serious thing . I like my kisses to mean something . And I like them to last a very long time . p. 55 ANA CECILIA ( Raising her chin and closing her eyes in anticipation of a kiss ) I 'm ready . JOS&amp;EACUTE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ANA CECILIA sighs as SHE watches him exit . ) ANA CECILIA He makes me feel like I 'm flying . ( Lights cross back to JOSLITO . ) JOS&amp;EACUTE ; LITO I often dreamed of changing places with a star . Then I could guide others . And maybe someone who loves me , would look up and see that I 'll be with her always in that part of the sky . And that would make her happy , I hope . And I would finally have my wings made of stardust . ( A rainstorm begins ; smiling at the thought of his bad luck ) But then , of course , it would rain . ( Lights cross to ISABEL . ) ISABEL I wish I had raindrops flowing through me , or snowflakes , or even tears . They do n't leave any stains  --  on the outside anyways . ( Lights cross back to DOLORES . ) DOLORES Once upon a time , there was a beautiful girl named Dolores , who lived in a shoebox , in a closet , and nobody ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful because they could n't hear her screaming  --  because she was in a box . So , one day , she cut a hole in the box with her teeth and ran out of that house . Because her stepfather  --  becauseAnd then she did n't know where to go because she could n't find her grandmother 's house , because it was in P.R. , so she went to the church instead . ( Lights cross to ANA CECILIA . Her memory fades as SHE speaks ) p. 56 ANA CECILIA He was so shy . Shy men are like jewels , their value only increases with time . No one ever treated me so much like a lady . No matter how hard I tried to tease him , he never once lost respect . ( Lights cross to JOSLITO in 1873 . As JOSELITO speaks , JOS MARIA , in the present , finishes his sentences , lost in his own memories . ) JOS&amp;EACUTE ; LITO And my wings would fill with water and I would fall back down to the earth  --  JOS&amp;EACUTE ;  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LITO And when she took me inside her  --  JOS&amp;EACUTE ; I would clean the dirt from her heart that someone else put there . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; LITO If I could remove that darkness , she could start on a new road that no one could follow . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Her own road . ( Pause ) It 's snowing so hard now  --  JOS&amp;EACUTE ; LITO &amp; JOS&amp;EACUTE ; MARIA  --  like it wo n't ever stop . ( JOS MARIA watches his memory of JOSLITO fade as ANA CECILIA speaks . ) ANA CECILIA ( Her face darkens as SHE speaks . ) But that viejo , out thereI do n't know who he is . I want to ask him , " What did you do with my Jos ? " You buried him somewhere so deep that I ca n't find him with my eyes or my fingertipsor my lips , but still I search . I 'm covered with the sadness of searching . I can taste my Jos when I swallow my own tears . " Ah , there he is , " I tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins to pray.Lights cross to DOLORES who is putting the top on the shoebox , covering the rat. ) p. 57 DOLORES There . That 's better . You got ta rest now . ( Kneeling down and slowly singing a hymn over the dead rat . ) " Aleluya , Aleluya , **28;1396;TOOLONG ! . " ( Lights cross to SHARON , who walks through the snow , kicking up snow as SHE walks in the dark . Finally , SHE tosses herself down and makes snow angels . JOS MARIA sees SHARON from his window and calls out to her . ) JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Sharon ! ( SHE does n't hear him because of the wind and because SHE is so intent on making her snow angels.JOS MARIA continues to watch SHARON as a light comes up on JOSLITO who surveys the scene around him , searching . ) JOS&amp;EACUTE ; LITO I think I 'll be able to tell when I have found my family . Not by the way they look , but how they will make me feel . ( Pause ) Even if they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ velvet petals of a flower or in the fierce waves of a storm at sea . SHARON ( Speaking to Junie in heaven ) There . That 's better than writing letters to heaven . ( Pause ) You know what I want to say anyways . ( Pause ) When you look down from heaven and see these angels waiting for you , I know you 'll find your way home . ( SHE continues to make snowangels as the lights grow to softly include JOSLITO , JOS MARIA , ANA CECILIA , DOLORES , and finally ISABEL . THEY all look up at the sky for a moment . Then ISABEL exits with the sound of the wind. ) @x " Feliz Cumpleaos ! " In the dark , the sound of wind begins . A snowstorm . JOS MARIA 's birthday . ISABEL stands on the outside of the front door , listening to her great-grandparents argue . SHE is holding a gift-wrapped package . On the inside , ANA CECILIA throws a set rat trap at JOS MARIA , who stands at the kitchen sink washing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely missing him . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Coo , mujer ! What are you doing ? ? Are you trying to cut my nose off with that thing ? ! ANA CECILIA I was n't aiming for your nose , you dirty man ! I 'm going to cut it off one day and you wo n't be able to bother me any more . I 'll snip it off with scissors one night and chop it into my morning eggs . That 's the way I want to wake up ! You should know better . Servants should never go after the lady of the house . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; But I 'm your husband . ANA CECILIA In your dreams , old man ! In your dreams ! Go cook me dinner ! And do n't put too much onions this time . If I get gas , I can not sing . If I can not sing  --  the people suffer from not hearing me . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Of course they do . We all suffer . p. 60 ANA CECILIA If you were really my husband , you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedroom as ISABEL knocks on the door . JOS MARIA answers . ) JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Isabelita ! You walked all the way here in this snow ? You must be frozen . ISABEL Naah . I like walking around in bad weather . It 's safer wif nobody hanging around in the street . ( Pause ) Why does she think you 're her servant ? JOS&amp;EACUTE ; So you were listening ? ! ( ISABEL looks embarrassed . ) She thinks everybody 's her servant . ISABEL Mami says she 's crazy . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; You do n't get to be as old as your great-grandmother without being a little crazy . ISABEL How old is she ? JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Ninety-nine . ISABEL Wow ! She is old . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; I 'm even older than that . ISABEL But you look better than her . You got pretty eyes , Papabuelo . Different from other eyes  --  but not crazy like hers . Papi says your eyes are green but they look yellow to me . Like pieces of gold smack in the middle of your face . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 61 JOS&amp;EACUTE ; ( Unwrapping the package ; it contains cherry-flavored chewing tobacco ) Que chever ! They let you buy tobacco ? ISABEL Yeah . I tole the man at the drugstore that it was for you . I had to hide it from Mami though . She thinks your eyes are yellow from too much of it . She does n't see what I see . Your eyes tell me things I could n't figure out by myself . How 'd you get yellow eyes like that ? JOS&amp;EACUTE ; I was born with them . ISABEL I was born with these eyes too . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; And these feet . ISABEL And these arms . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; And this head . ISABEL And this heart . ANA CECILIA ( Slapping JOS MARIA playfully on the butt ) And that fondillo . ( ISABEL laughs . ) And you ? I know why you 're here . I made a fresh batch this afternoon . ( Taking out what appears to be candies on a tray . ) Eat one . ( ISABEL hesitates . ANA CECILIA slaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't last forever . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Leave the girl alone , Ana Cecilia . p. 62 ANA CECILIA I said take one ! ( ISABEL takes one and holds it in her hand . ) Eat it ! You people always enjoy my chocolates . ISABEL ( Reluctantly putting the candy-like substance in her mouth  --  it 's really pieces of soap dipped in Hershey 's chocolate . ) Oooey ! ( Her mouth foaming up from the soap ) That stuff 's nasty . ( SHE tries to spit it out , but sees her great-grandmother is still watching , so SHE forces herself to finish the piece . ) ANA CECILIA You want another one ? ( ISABEL vigorously nods " No . " ) You 'll want some later . Good chocolates , huh ? Poor people have their minds in the sugar all the time . You 're like dogs for it . Hungry for it . I never liked sweets myself . They weaken your heart . People fall in love when they eat too much candy . Always with the wrong person . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . Their minds are in the sweets , covered with sugar . No sense . ( ANA CECILIA exits as ISABEL wipes the inside of her mouth on her sleeve . ) JOS&amp;EACUTE ; She never gives me any of her chocolates . ISABEL You can have all of mine . Dag ! She did that to me the last time . Does n't she know that people are n't supposed to eat soap ? ? And the way she carves them up to look like chocolates  --  that 's sick , papabuelo . Why did you marry her ? p. 63 JOS&amp;EACUTE ; She was the first person who did n't stare at my scars like I was a criminal . ( From inside JOS 's head a scene from the past is conjured . It is 1889 , ANA CECILIA &amp; JOS MARIA each dance with imaginary partners in a plaza in Puerto Rico . THEY dance near each other  --  perhaps back to back  --  talking so that no one else at the dance will know that they are talking to each other . ISABEL freezes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your neck ? Did you try to kill yourself ? JOS&amp;EACUTE ; No . It 's just a markfrom before . ANA CECILIA What kind of mark ? JOS&amp;EACUTE ; They tell me I was put in chains the day I could walk . I do n't remember that day . Even though I 'm a free man now , I still remember the chains . Why did you ask if I tried to kill myself ? ANA CECILIA I could never marry a suicidal man . Too much drama . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; You want to marry me ? ANA CECILIA Not today . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; And if I told you that I 've been watching you dance all night , waiting for you to look at me  --  And thought the only way I would become a slave again , would be to your heart  --  would that be too much drama ? p. 64 ANA CECILIA More like melodrama . Sangano ! I 'm near-sighted . I could n't see you anyway  --  until you stood right in front of me . ( THEY stop dancing and speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) JOS&amp;EACUTE ; I see you even when my eyes are closed  --  when I 'm asleep and dreaming . ANA CECILIA Are you falling in love with me , Joslito ? JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Oh , yes . And you ? ANA CECILIA I 'm undecided . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Really ? I 'll have to work harder then  --  I 'll set a new course for your heart every day until I reach it . If there 's one thing a sailor knows , it 's that there 's always more than one route to the important places . ANA CECILIA But that does n't mean the port is open when you get there , seorito . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; No . But I 'm very patient , seorita . ( THEY allow themselves to touch for a moment , each taking in the essence of the other . ) ( ISABEL interrupts JOS MARIA 's reverie . The memory fades as ISABEL speaks . ) ISABEL So you fell in love with her ? Because she di n't think you were a thief or a killer or somefin ? p. 65 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because she did n't care that I was a slave . In my nightmares , I see men putting pieces of iron around my neck , my wrists , my ankles . Then I can no longer feel the air  --  like God 's breath  --  against my skin . With metal on me like that again , I would stop being free . When I wake from those nightmares  --  she 's the one who holds me till I can fall asleep again . ISABEL You do n't still worry about that , do you ? Nobody 's gon na take you from the Bronx and chain you up again . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; There 's different ways of being chained , Isabel . You like this place ? ISABEL I did like it . But now I ca n't even walk home with my friend Sharon without somebody saying something about it . It do n't make no sense . The Black girls say we ca n't be friends no more because I 'm Puerto Rican . And the Puerto Rican girls say I should n't be hanging around with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was friends with who . Then Martin Luther King got shot and I got beat up the next day . I did n't kill him , why were they picking on me ? And anyway , was n't he was ours too . That was three years ago , but the fighting still has n't stopped . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; I told your father he should send you to Puerto Rico . It 's safer there . p. 66 ISABEL Oooey , no ! My stupid cousin Evelyn will be there and she 's always so mean , just because I speak bad Spanish . I ca n't help it . I 'm from here , Papabuelo . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; You 're from there too , m'ija . It 's in your blood  --  on your face . La mancha de platano siempre se te nota . ISABEL Great ! I 'm stained with bananas . That 's supposed to make me proud ? Sometimes I wish I was an orphan and then I could do anything I wanned because nobody 'd be watching what I do all the time . JOS&amp;EACUTE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I do . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Then we would n't be talking like this . I 'd just be some old man you might or might not meet on the street . You 'd see me and you 'd think " why is that wrinkly thing still alive ? " ISABEL I 'd never think that , Papabuelo . ( Taking his hands in hers and kissing them ) Do you miss P.R. ? Maybe you can go with me over Christmas . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; There 's parts of it I miss . I miss feeling the sand fill the spaces between my toes  --  letting the Sun pound on my back , turning my insides into a thick , hot soup that cures anything . I still think the Sun has the power to heal . Sometimes when I 'm not feeling so good , I sit right over there by that window and let the light caress my face . It always makes me feel better . ( Looking out the window ) Look at how hard it 's snowing now . I guess I wo n't be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gon na go ? JOS&amp;EACUTE ; I do n't know . Somewhere . I always hope I might go somewhere . ( Pause ; Noticing a big bruise on ISABEL 's arm . ) What happened to your arm ? Did that sinvergenza boyfriend do this to you ? ? Tell me , Isabel ! Tell me the truth . ISABEL No , Papabuelo . Ian would only hit me if I tried to take away his stupid pick . That boy is so vain . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; So what happened ? ISABEL I got beat up by some Blackgirls . They do n't like me going out with Ian . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Did you tell them you were Black too ? ISABEL No . ( Pause ) I am ? JOS&amp;EACUTE ; What do you think I am ? ISABEL I do n't know . You 're just my Papabuelo . ( Pause ) So you can be both ? JOS&amp;EACUTE ; You 're three things , nena . You 're African , Spanish and Indian . ISABEL Indian ? JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Taino . On your mother 's side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're telling me . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; You 're a jibara , nena . That 's a true Puerto Rican . That 's something to be proud of . I know people think jibaros are fools from the mountains  --  but that 's not so . Jibaros are what will keep our culture alive . They have all this blood from everywhere and that makes them stronger than everybody else . You are like a tree with strong roots all connected to a different river . You can drink from them all . That will keep you proud . ISABEL Proud ? I just feel confused . If I told those girls who beat me up that I was Black , they would say I was n't because I do n't look like them and because I got a Spanish last name . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Does it matter what they say ? ISABEL No . But they would never believe me . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; You want me to come to school and play show and tell ? ISABEL I do n't think that would matter to them . They already got it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would just be a Spanish guy with a tan . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; This " tan " made people think I was n't human . Did I upset you ? ISABEL I 'm just upset that there 's this disease that only Black people get and you might die because Sharon 's brother  --  p. 69 JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Mi'ja , I 'm one hundred and twelve years old . I 'm gon na die soon of something . ISABEL Do n't say that . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; It 's true . I 'm not afraid of it anymore . ( SHARON enters the street , slowly walking along it  --  like she 's lost . ) I respect Death . That 's why it stayed away for so long . But it wo n't stay away forever . And you better learn to respect where you came from or you 'll never be happy and that 's the same as being dead  --  maybe worse . ISABEL I 'm trying , Papabuelo . But it 's hard for me . I do n't like so many thingsBut I love you . Nothing makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the same blood as Sharon is so slick . She 'll freak out . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Freak out ? ISABEL Yeahbecause  --  I do n't know . I always thought I wanned her to be my sister instead of the sisters I got because we got so much the same , and nowI do n't know . We got even more . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; There 's a lot of important things to fight for  --  like a sister , or a motheror a wife . Make sure you fight only for the good things , nena  --  the things you ca n't live without . Those girls who hit you are so blind by their bad fight that they ca n't even see you . Like an angry blind man , trying to catch a bird by swinging his arms . What a useless thing ! That bird is just going to fly off , into the sky , to a better place  --  And if you ca n't even see it go , then you 'll never be able to catch it . p. 70 ISABEL If I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from those wenches . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Maybe you should stay home , nena . ISABEL I 'm not afraid . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; There 's no place that 's safe for us . ISABEL Sure . If you just bring Mamabuela and she gives out her special chocolates , the bad people will be running away from you like poisoned rats . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Do n't disrespect your mamabuela , Isabel . ISABEL But she 's an evil old wench  --  JOS&amp;EACUTE ; ( Slapping ISABEL ) Do n't ever say that again ! ( Silence , as JOS MARIA takes in what just happened . ) You do n't understand nothing about her . You do n't know everything , Isabel . Since we got attacked , we do n't even leave the house . ISABEL What do you mean you got attacked ? ? Where ? JOS&amp;EACUTE ; It does n't matter . ISABEL What do you mean it does n't matter ? ? Somebody attacked you , I wan na know about it ! JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Why ? So you can keep making fun of her ? Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; A few blocks from here . Some kids knocked me down onto the pavement so I passed out . But your poor grandmaThey did n't just rob us , m'ija . Now she wo n't even let me kiss her . ISABEL How could they do that to an old lady ? JOS&amp;EACUTE ; I do n't knowHow could I let them do that to her ? ISABEL If you were passed out , there was nothing you could do . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; A man does n't let  --  that was n't supposed to happen . ( Pause ) I still ca n't believe itHow does a boy of fifteen lose respect for a woman over ninety years old ? ( Lights cross to ANA CECILIA who speaks , watching the falling snow from her bedroom window . ) ANA CECILIA ( Recalling the attack ) One of them , the darkest one , put his fingers so deep inside me that I bled . I could n't believe how much that disgusting little animal looked like my Jos . I kept looking into their eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own grandmother in my face ? Was n't one of them going to feel the shame of what they were doing and stop or at least run away ? But no , all of them stayed and watchedI thought they had killed Jos . He lay on the ground looking like he was not even breathing . Both of us bleeding together . After a while they left  --  when I lost the energy to cry that seemed to bore them . When the ambulance came , I was too ashamed to tell them what happened . I thought they would never believe me . I did n't believe it . And this old man just got a cut on his head . The doctor kept asking me what did they do , but I would n't say . Nobody has to know that . I wish I could forget it . p. 72 JOS&amp;EACUTE ; ( Overlapping with ANA CECILIA ) I wish I could forget it . ISABEL So that 's why she 's so cuckoo . ( A quick look at JOS MARIA to make sure HE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , more even than she used to be . I feel bad now . I 'm so sorry , Papabuelo . I did n't know . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; There 's a lot you do n't know , Isabel . You judge people too harshly.Ven aca , nena . ( ISABEL goes to him and HE hugs her . ) ( From the other room , ANA CECILIA begins to sing " Bsame Mucho " by Consuelo Velazquez . ISABEL joins in . ) ANA CECILIA " Bsame , bsame mucho . ANA CECILIA &amp; ISABEL Como si fuera esta noche la ltima vez ! ( ANA CECILIA comes out of her room dancing and singing . SHE pulls ISABEL to her feet and dances with her as all three sing . ) ANA CECILIA , JOS&amp;EACUTE ; MARIA &amp; ISABEL Bsame , bsame mucho . Que tengo miedo a perderte perderte despus . Quiero tenerte muy cerca , mirarme en tus ojos , verte junto a m.Piensa que tal vez maana yo ya estar lejos muy lejos de aqu . " ( ANA CECILIA hands ISABEL an awkwardly-wrapped package . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) p. 73 ANA CECILIA Feliz cumpleaos , Isabel ! ( ISABEL stares at the gift in amazement as ANA CECILIA drifts back to her room , dancing and singing softly . ) ISABEL She never remembers my birthday . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; She always remembered . She just never got you a gift before . Go ahead and open it . ( ISABEL does so . The box is empty . It is the same box ISABEL opened in the PROLOGUE . ) ISABEL There 's nuffin in here . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Maybe you have to use your imagination . ISABEL Yeahthen I can have anything I want and it can last forever ( Pause ) If you could have anything in the world for your birthday , what would it be ? JOS&amp;EACUTE ; The tobacco 's pretty good . ISABEL No  --  uhn uhh . I mean , anything ! Like would you like to meet God ? JOS&amp;EACUTE ; I can wait for that one . But if I could have anythinghmmYou know what I 'd like ? To hear your great-grandmother say she loves me . ISABEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No  --  not yet . What do you think I have to do to make her say it ? I need some tools to help me , Belita . ISABEL Tools ? JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Tools of love . Not made of metal or wood . The best tools smell like the ocean  --  and a Christmas dinner of arroz con grandules y lechon . ISABEL Ohyou mean like flowers ? On TV , women always fall for flowers . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Yes . Flowers would be nice . But how do you find flowers in a snow storm ? ISABEL Leave it to me . There 's a place over on Fordham Road that sells them . Except  --  JOS&amp;EACUTE ; What ? ISABEL I do n't have any money left . That tobacco tapped me out . But I know where I can get some . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Do n't do anything crazy , Isabel . ISABEL I wo n't . ( Getting up and putting on her coat ) Wish me luck . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Be careful , m'ija . ISABEL Always . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Here . Take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doa Ana . And I  --  I want to surprise her , okay ? p. 75 ISABEL ( Taking the key HE offers her ) Okay . Oooh ! It 's warm . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; ( Kidding her ) That 's because I keep it by my heart , nena . ( ISABEL puts the key down the front of her blouse , into her bra . It does not fall out . SHE is very proud . ISABEL exits . JOS MARIA watches her go from the kitchen window . ) JOS&amp;EACUTE ; I hope she 's alright . I put crazy ideas in her head . That 's what Ana Cecilia always says . And maybe she 's right . But what if Isabel can find the right flowers for my Ana ? That 's not so crazy . I need them soon . ( Lights cross to IAN sitting on the front stoop. ) p. 76 Act 2 , Scene 2 : I Must Confess SCENE 2 " I Must Confess " IAN sits on the front stoop , watching ISABEL walk off . HE spins his globe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked right past me  --  like I was n't even here . ( Pause ) I hope nobody saw that . ( Picking at his hair ) That 's the last time I put myself out for a woman . ( Pause ) Lincoln Hayes never put himself on the line for Julie . Nuhuhh . He may be her partner in crime fighting , but he will not take a bullet for her  --  I mean , maybe he would  --  but not just because she 's a woman . I mean , he 's a hero and heroes have to stand in the way of bullets , right ? ( Pause ) Like my Uncle Nathan . He took a bullet for his country . ( Spins the globe and stops it over a hole in its surface ) Here 's where that bullet landed after slicing through the thick Asian air and entering my Uncle 's right hand . He said he was spinning you at the time.Just like this . ( Spinning the globe again ) And out of nowhere a sniper fired one shot . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Shoot the world ? No wonder they lost . You ca n't get rid of the world that easy . " ( Pause ) Unless your world 's just one person . ( Pause ) I even wrote her a song ( Singing his song ; a soulful ballad ; SHARON enters in the middle of IAN 's song , unseen by him . ) " My world is hell without my Isabel . My life 's so blue without you . You bring me happiness  --  and I must confess  --  You 're indeed  --  all the woman  --  I 'll ever need . If for any girl I fell , it 's for you , my Isabel It 's for you my Isabel " ( Speaking ) I guess I shoulda told her that . ( IAN sees SHARON glaring at him. ) p. 77 IAN Do n't give me that look ! SHARON Wow ! I did n't know shit could talk . IAN Do n't start . SHARON I do n't know what she sees in a selfish , stuck-up " dude " like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know me . SHARON I do n't want to know you . IAN And I do n't want to know me . SHARON There ai n't nothing to know . IAN Even if you knew you would n't know , because what do you know anyway ? ! SHARON If I wanted to know , I would know , but I do n't so I do n't . So what 's that to you ? ? IAN Nothing . You 're nothing to me . SHARON That goes double for me . IAN Double nothing is twice nothing is beyond nothing , sister . SHARON Ooh , no you did n't . No , no , no . You do not call me sister . I only ever had one " bro " and he is not you . IAN Why do you hate me so much ? SHARON I do n't care about you enough to hate you . p. 78 IAN If you gave me a chance , you might even like me . SHARON No . Uhnuhh . IAN I sing better than Tito . SHARON He plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Jackson Fives ' " The Love You Save . " ) IAN " Stop , the love you save may be your own . Darling take it slow  --  or one day you 'll be all alone . You better stop  --  " ( SHARON exits . HE stops singing . ) I better stop . I wish I was somebody else right now . Anybody else . ( HE watches her go and then exits in the opposite direction . ) ( Lights cross back to the Sotillo apartment. ) p. 79 Act 2 , Scene 3 : Poets Respect Silence SCENE 3 " Poets Respect Silence " JOS MARIA takes out some tobacco and begins to chew , as we hear ANA CECILIA clearing her throat from the bedroom . SHE makes loud , nasty phlegm-filled sounds . ANA CECILIA enters . SHE is wearing a strange outfit that only SHE thinks is beautiful . ANA CECILIA I wrote you a poem , viejo . For your birthday . Are you ready ? JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Yes , I think so . Do I have to do something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; I can do that . ( ANA CECILIA opens her mouth but no sound comes out of it.JOS MARIA watches her closely , waiting for something to come out . Finally , SHE closes her mouth , and bows . ) JOS&amp;EACUTE ; That was  --  beautiful . ANA CECILIA I worked on it a long time . In my room . My gooseness , you think I do n't do nothing back in there , but my mind is  --  ( Making a spiraling gesture with her hand )  --  like that ! Going , going , all around . If you tried to take a picture of my mind , forgedaboudit , you 'd get lost . ( ANA CECILIA exits . JOS MARIA goes to the kitchen window. ) p. 80 JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Her poems are getting better . ( Pause ) I hope Isabel will be alright . ( The lights cross to the street. ) p. 81 Act 2 , Scene 4 SCENE 4 IAN , SHARON &amp; DOLORES each taking a different path down the street , lost in thought . THEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a red ribbon . IAN carries a globe.DOLORES carries a rosary . SHARON I keep getting lost on my way home . You 'd think I would remember the way , but this snow makes it so I get all turned around . IAN I 'm going to give this to Isabel . Then she 'll love me again . DOLORES Is the holy spirit a man or a woman ? I think she 's a woman  --  because she 's got ta have long hair to hide behind . SHARON Do I go right or left here ? Each time I leave it takes longer to get back . DOLORES The holy spirit 's got ta hide or somebody will try to take her power away . If somebody takes her power , then we got no hope left . IAN Or maybe she won'tMaybe she 'll never understand that we could go someplace that 's not here and everything would be better.Even if I find her , I wo n't know what to say . SHARON Everything takes such a long time when you 're sad . IAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Might as well not even try . p. 82 DOLORES Without hope , you might as well be  --  you know  --  dead . SHARON I think it 's right . I just keep walking until I smell my mother 's cooking . IAN I miss her face . I could get lost there . I ca n't let myself get lost . DOLORES When you got the holy spirit , you 're not lost anymore . DOLORES , IAN &amp; SHARON I 'm almost home . ( Lights cross to ISABEL. ) p. 83 Act 2 , Scene 5 : Parchessi For Love SCENE 5 " Parchessi For Love " ISABEL is rushing to get the flowers . SHE bumps into SHARON who carries the parchessi board tied with a red ribbon . SHARON Hey ! ISABEL Hey ! SHARON You never came to my house for a game , so I thought I 'd come find you . ISABEL I got a set just like that one . SHARON OhI was gon na give this to you for your birthday . It 's tomorrow right ? ISABEL Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually remind me . Where have you been ? ISABEL Around . I ca n't play today . SHARON If you do n't wan na be my friend anymore just say so . Do n't be running away from me all the time . Sneaking off to kiss that stupid boyfriend of yours . ISABEL He 's not my boyfriend . And anyway , what do you mean run ? It 's you who keeps disappearing . Where do you keep going ? You walk around like a ghost , haunting the street . What are you looking for all the time ? SHARON I just have to walk sometimes . And you have not been around , girl . p. 84 ISABEL I 'm around now . Look . ( Putting out her hand ) Touch me and I wo n't go away . ( SHARON takes her hand , then slaps it away . ) You see ? SHARON See what ? ISABEL ( ISABEL takes SHARON 's hand and holds onto it tightly . ) We 're the same you and me . SHARON Nuhuhh . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . Seriously . I 'm Black . SHARON Since when ? ISABEL Since always . SHARON You ca n't just be Puerto Rican one day and the next day be Black . ISABEL Oh , yes I can . My papabuelo told me . SHARON Being Black is more than that . What do you feel like inside ? ISABEL I feel stupid . Like I shoulda known this my whole life  --  but I did n't . SHARON Yup . That is kinda stupid . ISABEL You 'd think with all the beatings I got  --  ( Knocking on her own head )  --  some sense would get knocked in here . p. 85 ISABEL &amp; SHARON ( In unison ) But nooo . SHARON There 's probably nothing that could do that . ISABEL I 've missed you , Sharon . SHARON I know . That 's why I came looking for you  --  one more time . ISABEL But you did n't know you were looking for a Black girl , did you ? SHARON You 're crazy , Isabel . You ca n't just take on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ISABEL I 'm not . I just think somewhere inside I always knew it . It does n't seem all freaky or anything . ( Pause ) Remember when we was little kids in kindergarten  --  and the teacher asked us to sit in separate parts of the room because we talked too much ? SHARON YeahShe said she never knew two girls so different yet so the same . Like we had the same mother or something . ISABEL Right . And we used to play that we did . I was Isabelli McNieves . And you were Sharoni McNieves . SHARON We 're too old to play that game again . And it 's not a game anymore , Isabel . Who you are can get you killed these days . p. 86 ISABEL I know that . Who knows that better than me ? You got ta stop thinking that you 're the only one who can figure out my problems . SHARON You do n't take things serious like you need to , girl . ISABEL Sure I do . But I do n't got ta walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sharon , it 's not your fault that Junie died . Everything is n't your problem . I 'm not your problem . When are you going to stop trying to protect me by avoiding me ? Or only meeting me at the pizza parlor ? SHARON I was n't doing that . ISABEL Yes , you were . SHARON I came over here in a snowstorm with a stupid parchessi board . Is that avoiding you ? ISABEL You do n't need an excuse to see me . SHARON I do when you got that lame-ass boyfriend following you around . ISABEL He 's gone . SHARON Did he take that trip around the world yet ? ISABEL Not with me . ( THEY both smile at the sexual innuendo . ) SHARON You wan na be friends again ? p. 87 ISABEL What have I been saying all this time , Sharon ? ! SHARON You really liked playing my sister ? ISABEL Yeah . I really did . When my Papabuelo tole me , then I knew you was family . Not just in my heart  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) SHARON What are you crying for ? ( SHARON begins to cry as SHE watches ISABEL cry . ) ISABEL I do n't know . Maybe the same thing you 're crying for . SHARON I really need a sister right now . ISABEL Me too . SHARON It ca n't be that easy . ISABEL I know . But between you and me  --  it always has been . SHARON There ai n't nuttin easy about being your friend , Isabel . So what is it you are now ? A Porto-Blacka-Rican ? ISABEL Except when I 'm talkin ' . Then I 'm a Porto-Blacka-Rican speakin ' . SHARON You 're just cracked , girl . ISABEL Do n't look so worried , Sharon . At least we know we 're okay  --  right ? I meanare n't we ? ( THEY embrace briefly and then pull away and push each other playfully on the head. ) p. 88 ISABEL Hey , I got an errand to run .

SHARON I told you they was going to . ISABEL Who cares ? ! We got ta go find some flowers . SHARON Flowers ? It 's snowing . ISABEL I know .

ISABEL Do n't worry about it . SHARON It 's not stealing , is it ? ISABEL Not when it 's for love . ( THEY exit arm in arm as the lights cross to IAN &amp; DOLORES. ) p. 89 Act 2 , Scene 6 : Holy Spirit SCENE 6 " Holy Spirit " IAN &amp; DOLORES on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DOLORES You 're gon na like this . There 's a lot of singing . IAN Oh , man . DOLORES And sometimes the holy spirit lifts you up and makes your eyes roll back in your head . IAN I thought Jehovah 's Witnesses were quiet . DOLORES Oh , they are . We changed to Pentacostal last week . My Ma likes the minister better . IAN DoloresI do n't know  --  DOLORES It 's beautiful . You 'll see . I get the holy spirit almos ' every time . IAN What 's it look like ? DOLORES It 's like  --  it 's like going around the world . IAN Oh DOLORES And then coming back home . ( DOLORES grabs IAN 's arm tightly , pulling him toward the church as IAN picks nervously at his afro . Lights cross to SHARON &amp; ISABEL on the stoop and JOS MARIA in the apartment. ) p. 90 Act 2 , Scene 7 : Tools of Love SCENE 7 " Tools Of Love " JOS MARIA sees ISABEL &amp; SHARON outside , from the kitchen window . ISABEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the stoop , ISABEL &amp; SHARON speak . ISABEL Are n't you gon na come up ? SHARON NaaahI 'll wait here . I like the snow . It makes everything so quiet.Sounds like a church out here now . ISABEL Okay . I 'll be out soon . ( SHARON sits on the stoop in front of the building playing with the snow . HE hurries to sit in a chair like HE has n't been watching for her this whole time . We hear the key in the lock . ISABEL enters brandishing the bouquet of flowers . ) ISABEL Look , Papabuelo ! I tole you I could get them ! Ai n't they fine ? ! JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Beautiful . ( Smelling them ) They smell like papaya and sea grass . ( Getting dizzy ) Oooey ! I better sit down . That smell is so strong ISABEL You do n't look so good . Maybe I should call my mother . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Do n't bother her . She just got home from work . p. 91 ISABEL I know . She almost caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to kinda  --  take some money from her stocking stash . She keeps it in her bureau , second drawer from the top . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Isabel ! ISABEL It 's okay . It was the first time I ever did that . And it was important . I had to buy some tools of love . ANA CECILIA ( Eavesdropping on the previous conversation ) Tools of love ? ! My sister Patito 's husband had one of those . He made it out of wood and kept it in his pants . And when the young girls would go by his house , he 'd sit out there on the porch and lift it up like he was  --  well , you know . And the girls would scream . One night , he even tried to put it inside my sister , but that was that  --  she took it away from him and burned it . Took the ashes and spread them over her altar so that God would keep him away from her . It worked . ISABEL Are n't you gon na give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you smell that ? ISABEL What ? JOS&amp;EACUTE ; It 's so strong . It 's giving me a headache . Just let me close my eyes for a minute , m'ija. p. 92 ISABEL Okay . You want me to rub your feet with alcohol ? JOS&amp;EACUTE ; That would be nice . ( ISABEL gets a bottle of Florida water and begins taking off JOS MARIA 's socks . A light comes up on JOSLITO in the same spot at the snowangel , rubbing the sore spots where the shackles rubbed his legs raw , as JOS tells his ghost story . ) ISABEL But you have to tell me a story . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; I do ? About what ? ISABEL About when you was a little boy . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; You like those stories , huh ? AlrightDid I ever tell you about the first ghost I saw ? ISABEL ( Impressed ) The first one ? Dag ! How many you seen ? ? JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Enough . Enough to recognize good ones from bad ones . The one I 'm thinking about now came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pemplin , the old master had taken me out to his ship . He was showing me how to get places by looking at the stars  --  letting them lead you to wherever you needed to go . After my lesson , I begged him to let me stay and sleep on the deck of his ship . It was so beautiful there . He let me stay , but he shackled me to the mast . I do n't know where he thought I would run to . But it did n't matter . I lay back against the sails of that ship and watched the stars . They became alive in my head . They began to talk to me , whispering , " Joscome to us . There 's a space here we 're saving for you . Come , Jos . We know you want to fly with us . " And I did . I closed my eyes and imagined my chains turning into dust at my feet , and great brown wings sprouting from my spine , lifting me up , gently like the arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I always thought being in her arms would feel like that . p. 93 ISABEL It does feel like that . I mean when you 're a baby . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; I knew it . Anyway , I was having this wonderful daydream , when I saw this piece of seaweed walking toward me . It was white though , not green or brown , so I closed my eyes again . I thought maybe something had gotten caught in my eye or that I was just seeing things from rocking around on the ship . All that rocking can go to your head they told me . But when I opened my eyes again , it was still there but closer . It smelled like the inside of a coconut  --  like its milk . Sweet , but slightly burned . And that smell came over me , inside me . Into my mouth , down my throat . I thought it would choke me , but once I realized it was n't trying to hurt me , it just filled me up like a delicious piece of roast pork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never allowed to eat . We just got the fat to eat , and pretended it was meat . This thing  --  whatever it was  --  knew how hungry I was . And I thought to myself , " Is this God feeding me ? Is God a piece of lace from the sea ? " I did n't get an answer that day , but I know each day I get closer to one . ISABEL What do you mean ? JOS&amp;EACUTE ; When I close my eyes , I go to so many places . I can see my mother  --  she looks so young  --  like you Isabel  --  And I can see them take me away from her . I can see her scream as they whip her on the back of her knees . That 's where I got whipped too . So I could n't walk without limping . I can see the doctor who helped straighten out my legs . That was the second time they had metal wrapped around them , but this was good metal . I was n't afraid of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . JOS&amp;EACUTE ; Why ? I see the stars now too . But how can I see the stars when it 's still snowing so hard ? Or maybe it stopped snowing . Look out the window , m'ija . ( JOSLITO exits into the night leaving his shackles behind him in the same place as SHARON 's snowangel . SHARON moves on the stoop as if SHE can sense JOSLITO 's presence . ) ISABEL ( Moving to the window and looking out ) Yep . It 's still snowing alright . Real hard . These are like the biggest snowflakes I ever seen . ( Opening the window and catching a snowflake on her hand ) Look ! Fits like almos ' exactly in my hand . You see ? ( No response ) Papabuelo ? ( ISABEL comes and takes JOS MARIA 's hand . ) Papabuelo ? You sleeping ? You ca n't go to sleep now . Not before we give her the flowers . ( Pause ) PapabueloNot yet . You do n't got ta go yet . God could n't want this  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I brought you the tools of love . ( ISABEL begins to cry quietly . ANA CECILIA enters picking up the flowers and putting them in a pitcher with water . ) ANA CECILIA Finally  --  that viejo finally left me something that smells good . p. 95 ISABEL Did you love him , Mamabuela ? ANA CECILIA He was a good servant . ISABEL But did you love him ? ANA CECILIA Sometimes . ( Long pause ) Sometimes , I could not stop loving him . ( ANA CECILIA takes the blankets from the foot of his bed and covers him gently with them . ) Let 's sing him to sleep , Isabel . " Arrorr mi nio , arrorr mi amor . ( Hushabye my child , hushabye my love . Arrorr pedazo de mi corazon . ( Hushabye piece of my heart . Ese nio bueno que quiere dormir , ( The good child who wants to sleep , cierra los ojitos despus los vuelve abrir. " ( closes his eyes to later open them again . ) ISABEL Did you see that ? ! Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to heaven . ANA CECILIA ( With a wicked little laugh ) How do you know they were n't devils ? ISABEL I know an angel when I smell one . ANA CECILIA Yes . It smells like sand and ocean now . Open the window so his soul can go free . p. 96 ISABEL Papabuelo is going home . ANA CECILIA ( In a whisper ) I love you , Jos Maria , I always loved you . I wanted to die first , so that no one would ever know how much I needed you . I never wanted anyone to know . ( ISABEL moves into an isolated pool of light on the front stoop. ) @x " A Box of Air and Memory " ISABEL leans against the stoop of the building , looking out and talking to the wind , which SHE has released from inside the box which ANA CECILIA gave her . SHARON sits on the stoop with her eyes tightly closed . ISABEL Hello , wind . Papabuelo told me where to find you . Do you know that that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Hearing his name made him a man to me . Made him real . Sometimes I thought I made him up . People look at me and think I do n't have any African blood . But it 's not on my skin  --  it 's inside  --  ( Pointing to her heart )  --  here . It 's in the stories I tell . In the music that makes me move . In the things that make me smile . Or sometimes cry . My great-grandfather taught me that to live life you had to remember to watch the stars and be in awe of them . You have to be able to close your eyes and see the earth melt from your eyelids into your head . And from your head into all your lower parts , until you 're walking on the earth , connected to it  --  not just by gravity , but by family . And because of him , I know how to dance with the angels . That 's a dance that frees your soul . ( Both ISABEL &amp; SHARON look up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) One day , I hope to look into my child 's face , and see yellow eyes there too . ( ISABEL closes the box and calls out to SHARON. ) p. 98 Hey , Sharon , where 'd you get eyes like that ? SHARON I was born with them . ISABEL I was born with these eyes too . ( SHARON gets up and takes ISABEL 's hand . THEY look up and each try to catch a snowflake in their free hand as THEY both take a deep breath . For a moment , the only light is the twinkle of the stars with the sound of the wind. )
