Growing up is complicated for Avril Lavigne , 19 , who releases Under My Skin this week , a follow-up to her hit 2002 debut CD , Let Go . <P> Your new single , Do n't Tell Me , stumps for sexual abstinence . Is that something you believe in ? <P> I wrote that when I was 17 , and I was going through the phase in high school where every guy has ulterior motives . I do n't think I would have written it now . I thought it was a good message , for girls to be strong . <P> Have you gone back and listened to your first album recently ? <P> When I was making this record I did . I was like , Oh , my God , I sound like a little kid . <P> Rumor has it you do n't like your big hit , Complicated . I hate it . It 's hard to sing . My voice goes really low in the verse , and it always cracks . But I have to sing it because everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone who enjoys a few drinks . Is that deserved ? <P> My last tour I was drinking all the time . I 'm superhealthy this time because I 'm watching my sugar levels . My diet before was just a mess . Pizza , mozzarella sticks , pancakes . <P> Back to the drinking ... I only drink now when there 's a party . I do n't drink every night after the show anymore . That makes me sound like I was an alcoholic , which I was n't . <P> But you have been in a bar fight . That 's true . Some girl came up to me and started it . She said , You ruined punk rock . I said , What ? Then she said it again . So I kicked her and punched her , and she got tossed out of the bar . The pathetic thing is , I heard she wanted an autograph too .
