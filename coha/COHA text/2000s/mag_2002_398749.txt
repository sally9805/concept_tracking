It was refreshing as well as fulfilling to read your articles about the historically Black colleges and universities . I am a graduate of a historically Black college , Tuskegee University , and sometimes it seems like HBCUs are almost forgotten , or at least a second thought . These colleges and universities are the backbone of our nation , not just for African-Americans , but for humankind all over the world . Especially uplifting was the article representing the new presidents . We have some great leaders leading these institutions , and they are to be commended for an outstanding job . Equally refreshing was the article about the college and university young leaders . It seems like these young people have their heads screwed on straight and that our future is in great hands . They have goals and they know how to get there with a well  --  mapped-out plan . Thank you so much for highlighting these positive experiences of our heroes and heroines , and not just athletes . These articles gave me renewed hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 1963 graduate of Tuskegee University ( Tuskegee Institute when I graduated ) . DR . JOHN N. ARRINGTON San Diego , Calif FOR BROTHERS ONLY This letter is to acknowledge the " For Brothers Only " column , " Facing The Fear Of Failure " in the September 2002 issue .

CAMPBELL Kogi State , Nigeria HEALTH &; FITNESS SECTION I read with interest your coverage on heart disease , breast cancer , diabetes , prostate cancer and colon cancer in the " Annual Health &; Fitness " issue ( July 2002 ) . I would like to bring to the attention of your readers two important ophthalmic diseases that are important to us as African-Americans diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma . A comprehensive eye examination through dilated pupils performed annually in diabetic patients can ensure early intervention with laser therapy if needed .

Considering the importance that vision plays in the quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of undergoing a comprehensive eye examination needs to be underscored . EVE J. HIGGINBOTHAM , M.D. Professor and Chair , University of Maryland School of Medicine Baltimore , Md . WHY GOSPEL MUSIC IS SO POPULAR This letter is in regard to the article , " Why Gospel Music Is So Hot , " ( July 2002 ) . For so many years and generations , the Black church has associated a certain " sound " or particular " melody " with gospel music , and calling it " the " sound . The new sounds of praise are very refreshing , and giving gospel an exciting sound that attracts people who are not normally attracted to the so-called " churchy " sound . I think it is untimely for traditional Black Christians to condemn a more contemporary sound that is both entertaining and edifying . As Christians and gospel fans , we are lifting up Jesus and competing for " His " glory and attention in a hip-hop-driven culture . Songs about our savior should be marketed to the highest degree , and it should be entertaining . JOSEPH S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you for recognizing the significant and increasing contributions that people of color are making in philanthropy ( " Blacks In Money : Foundation Heads Manage Billions , " Aug. 2002 ) . All of the professionals you listed stand for and promote the highest levels of integrity that many aspire to achieve . The Council on Foundations is committed to diversity throughout the field of philanthropy and is working hard to ensure that there are many more people to follow in the footsteps of those you featured .
