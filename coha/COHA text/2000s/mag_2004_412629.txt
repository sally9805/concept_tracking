" The First Amendment asks of us that we find a way , perhaps along a winding and rocky path , to allow both individual freedom and public openness in matters of religion , and to do so without allowing either concern to swallow up the other . " // THERE HAVE BEEN arguments over religion and politics since long before there was a U.S. Despite the fact that several of the 13 colonies originated in the desire to create a righteous community in the New World free of the theological conflicts of the Old , in practice the colonists found themselves just as embroiled in disagreements rooted in religious faith . Following independence , Americans tried a different approach . One by one , those states in which a church had been established ended that legal status , and the nation as a whole enshrined in the Constitution the sweeping command of the First Amendment : " Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . " Thomas Jefferson , one of the nation 's more outspoken Founding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall of separation between church and state " that would keep the public sphere free from the divisive effects of religious strife . Whatever one makes of Jefferson and his views on religion , he turns out to have been a rather poor prophet . His metaphor , to be sure , has had a long and important life in U.S. law-the Supreme Court has been quoting him on the subject since 1878-but as a description of American political life , the suggestion that religion and government do not overlap is false . They intersect in a variety of ways . The constitutional question of how courts and others are to obey the First Amendment 's command is better understood as an inquiry into the appropriate relationship between public life and religious faith rather than as an effort to maintain some unscalable wall . Recognizing that this is so may be one reason the Supreme Court-at least in recent years-has cooled noticeably toward Jefferson 's famous language . Yet , is it truly the case that the First Amendment ordains a courtship rather than a divorce between religion and government ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why , we need to recall that the Amendment makes two demands with respect to religion and public life . There shall be no establishment-no marriage , as it were , between religion and the state-but equally there is to be no prohibition on the free exercise of religion or , the Amendment goes on to say , any abridgment of the freedom of speech , which includes , of course , the freedom to express religious views . In other words , as a constitutional matter , this country is committed to according the maximum possible freedom to persons of all creeds to believe , and to speak and act in accordance with their beliefs . Everyone , regardless of religious persuasion , is equally free to participate in the public life of the nation even while the Constitution declares that our public life itself is to be free of anything resembling an established religious ( or irreligious ) faith . The principles of individual freedom of religion and public freedom from religious establishments seek , in many respects , complementary goals : Only those happy with the state 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an orthodoxy . There is , however , a tension between the two principles , for those who exercise authority in the public sphere , and who thus are obliged to respect the no-establishment principle , also are individuals , entitled like the rest of us , to maintain and express their religious views . For example , a Federal judge may hold whatever religious views he or she wishes , but at the same time is obliged as a public official not to wield governmental authority on behalf of a religious orthodoxy . Can this really be accomplished , or are our First Amendment commitments actually in opposition , at least when the individual 's religious beliefs lead him or her to view as evil that which the government or the legal system requires ? Photograph Photograph // One answer is that there is , or should be , no conflict between individual freedom and the ban on the establishment of religion because religious belief and practice are by definition " private " matters that do not belong in the public sphere . Here , Jefferson 's wall of separation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the First Amendment , but of the internal duty of any religious person who wishes to hold public office : acting in office , he or she must scrupulously avoid any reliance on religious motives or beliefs because they are constitutionally illegitimate . Sometimes , especially in academic circles , the point is put in universal terms : In a secular democracy , it is impermissible in public life to act on or advert to religious motives under any circumstances , including those of the citizen determining who to vote for . Such arguments rest on a radical misunderstanding of religion , and any attempt to act on them simply would exclude religious people from the public sphere-and thus violate our constitutional duty to accord to all persons , regardless of convictions , the right of equal participation in our common life . Religious commitments are , almost by definition , transcendent in the claims they make on the faithful . " Here I stand , I can do no other " may sound implausibly heroic or unpleasantly self-assured , but its logic is shared by all the established faiths . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty , it is the orthodox claim thai musl be honored , the secular obligation which must give way . To say to the religious that they are " free " to participate in public life as long as they refrain from acting on their most fundamental beliefs and loyalties is to make a demand that they can not , in good conscience , agree to . Far from belonging to a private sphere without significance for one 's public duties , religious tenets are the very foundation on which those who have such commitments shape their actions as citizens , voters , or governmental officials . There can be no religious people in the public arena unless they can observe their faith there . The Constitution , once again , does not permit any such exclusion . We can not solve the dilemma of religion intersecting government by building Jefferson 's wall . Nor can we ask our fellow citizens to solve the problem for us by constructing such a wall within their hearts and minds . Moreover , if we are to fulfill the commitments embodied in the First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that some of us are bound by allegiances older and deeper than loyalty to our country . In recognizing this fact , we in no way impugn the patriotism of the devout or their respect for the law . all that we do is to enact that profound respect for each individual 's conscience which the Constitution requires . Supreme Court weighs in That same Constitution prohibits the use of official power to further any religious orthodoxy . For decades , the Supreme Court 's decisions on the establishment clause were written by justices who believed that the Amendment rigorously excludes all expressions of faith from public life . More recently , however , a new majority has moved to the conclusion that the Amendment allows the expression of religious faith by governmental action . The Religious Right and the American Civil Liberties Union do not agree , of course , on how to evaluate this change : for one group , it is a return to constitutional truth and , for the other , a tale of constitutional apostasy . Those who gravitate toward one or the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court 's trajectory . The perception is wrong . The center of gravity on the Supreme Court about establishment clause issues has shifted , but the description of that change misconceives both where the Court was in , say , 1969 ( the year Chief Justice Earl Warren retired ) and the present . The Court of 1969 , which famously or infamously " banned school prayer , " did no such thing . The Court held that the First Amendment forbids the use of state power to enforce or state money to promote any view on faith , including one of hostility toward all religion . Reasonable people can differ about whether the Court always applied the no-establishment principle correctly , but it is false to assert that it forbade the expression of religious faith in the public sphere-including by prayer . Fast forward to the present . A majority of justices disagree with some establishment clause decisions and believe it correct to uphold certain practices that earlier majorities would have seen as violations . Yet , today 's Court unanimously shares the view of the Court of 1969 that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious orthodoxy by governmental power or public money . The disagreement on the current Court over prayer in public school revolves around whether one thinks a student genuinely is free to refrain without cost from participation in such prayers . A majority of the justices agree with the Court of 1969 that the answer is no . No member , though , believes that the Constitution permits the state to enforce or even promote a particular tenet . There may be justices who would uphold the validity of an elementary school teacher reciting a prayer to a generic " God " on behalf of a public school classroom . There are no justices who would uphold such a prayer addressed to " the Most Holy and Undivided Trinity , " or to " Allah , the Compassionate , the Merciful , " or to " the Lord Krishna , " or ( and here , of course , the word prayer is itself problematic ) the recital that " I take refuge in the Buddha . " For many decades , the modern Supreme Court unanimously has understood it to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry out the duties of their offices in accordance with shared and nonsectarian norms of conduct . Those norms are not simply external rules ; they are personal undertakings by the official-indeed , promises solemnized by oath or affirmation-to carry out his or her public duties as our political community understands those responsibilities . For instance , when someone takes the oath of office to become a Federal judge , he or she promises to act within the norms defining that office , one of which is that a lower-court judge must attempt in good faith to follow and apply relevant Supreme Court precedent . That duty applies to precedent that judge thinks wrong as much as it does to precedent he or she thinks correct , and it does not vary if the judge 's objections happen to be theological in nature . No matter how evil one thinks Roe v. Wade to be , in taking an oath , a lower-court judge has promised to enforce Roe in accordance with governing precedent unless and until the Supreme Court says otherwise . There is no conflict here with our constitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious person is entitled to criticize Roe v. Wade ( or any other Supreme Court decision ) and to do so on theological grounds . As a public officer , a person is bound by his or her own undertaking to execute a position of trust and responsibility in accordance with the shared and public expectations of the Republic , in exactly the same manner as if that individual was of a different faith , or was not religious at all . If a judicial candidate 's religious faith would not permit him or her to carry out the office in that fashion , then it would be an act of secular bad faith to take the oath of office . In considering any judicial nominee , the candidate 's candor and ability to act in accordance with the law are fair topics for the Senate to consider-indeed , there can be few other issues of equal importance . If a senator has serious doubts about a judge 's willingness to act in accordance with the norms of the judicial office , those doubts are a legitimate basis for opposing confirmation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a grant of special privilege to religious followers . Any understanding of the Constitution leaves room for manipulation by those cynical enough to cloak antireligious bias or conscious bad faith under the guise of self-righteous indignation . However , there is not any way to avoid this risk in the long run . Any humane and decent approach to the question of " church and state " is going to be vulnerable to cynicism and hypocrisy . A democratic and inclusive political community has to depend on the good faith of its citizens and its servants if it is to survive . There are no mechanical solutions to the problem of bad faith . Yet , what of the ramifications of political conflict rooted in religious conviction ? The issue is deeply divisive and potentially explosive . That surely is part of the reason why so many societies have attempted to eliminate religious opposition by defining a religious orthodoxy ( or an antireligious one-think of the former Soviet Union ) , although the fear of such conflict plainly motivates many to keep religion and politics apart . They wish Jefferson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflicting religious convictions . The Constitution permits neither solution . We have committed ourselves as a people not to adopt a religious orthodoxy nor to erect a wall that cuts through the very souls of our fellow citizens . As justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote almost a century ago , our Constitution is an experiment . The outcome of that experiment remains uncertain . Living up to our commitments about religion and government is difficult , and at times extremely uncomfortable . The First Amendment asks of us that we find a way , perhaps along a winding and rocky path , to allow both individual freedom and public openness in matters of religion , and to do so without allowing either concern to swallow up the other . This is no easy task , but it is the only way to maintain a public life that is open to all .
