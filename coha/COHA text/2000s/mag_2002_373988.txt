Punch-drunk . Terry McAuliffe must have been punch-drunk . After seeing a Republican President gain congressional seats in a midterm election for the first time since 1902 , the Democratic National Committee chairman offered a woozy bit of spin : " I could make the argument that George Bush should have done a lot better last night . " McAuliffe was not the only one finessing the results . " This country is still in the upheaval of 9/11 , " said dethroned Senate majority leader Tom Daschle . " The war in Iraq , the North Korean situation  --  all of that probably precluded us from having the opportunity to break through with the issues we wanted to talk about the most . " <P> It 's true that control of the Senate came down to a swing of just 41,000 votes in Missouri and New Hampshire . It 's also true that those votes swung Republican , and in the minds of voters , the problem was n't that the Democratic message was obscured but that the Democrats obscured it . After examining a postelection poll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt " neither party has a plan to strengthen the economy . " But he added that " this is a particularly strong indictment of the Democrats . They needed to be crystal clear about what they stand for on issues of importance to workers  --  jobs , the economy , health care . " <P> The message problem is endemic to Democrats . The party boasts a big tent , but that tent doubles as a big boxing ring , and in the weeks before the election every genus of Democrat  --  from the Southern pro-gun , antiabortion members of Congress to the Northern pro-choice , gun-control liberals in the Senate  --  duked it out over how to counter the President 's agenda . Liberals argued it was time to get tougher with Bush on Iraq and the economy ; moderates , many of whom backed Bush 's war resolution and tax-cut proposal , argued it was time to get tougher on liberals . In the end the Democrats never got close to formulating a unified message . They simply failed to take their fight outside the tent . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nancy Pelosi to the House minority-leader post vacated by Dick Gephardt indicates that for now the party will lean left . But for some , ideology is less important than unity . " Democrats have to go forward with a sharp message , " Massachusetts Senator John Kerry told TIME . " It 's not a question of moving left or right . People want you to look them in the eye and tell them what you 're for . " <P> Which brings us back to the beginning . What are Democrats  --  all Democrats  --  actually for in 2002 ? Though some party leaders realized that campaigning on the economy got them nowhere  --  " No one has really felt the pain of the Bush economic policies yet , " says Democratic Senate whip Harry Reid  --  many believe it 's time to go after Bush 's tax cut . " The economy is in shambles because of that tax cut , " says Pennsylvania Governor-elect and former D.N.C. chair Ed Rendell . " We can translate that into things people understand : ' You 're not going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life better . Why ? Because they gave all the money away in a tax cut . ' Find everything that people are concerned about , everything that they need from government in their lives , and attach it to tax cuts . "
