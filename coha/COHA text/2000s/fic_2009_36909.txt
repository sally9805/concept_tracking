Emily singled him out immediately , not because his father had described him so well that she could n't miss him , but because even though he stood well back from everyone else , he dominated the throng waiting to meet passengers newly arrived at Athens 's Venizelos Airport . At more than six feet of lean , toned masculinity blessed with the face of a fallen angel , he could hardly help it . One look at him was enough to tell her he was the kind of man other men envied , and women fought over . <p> As if on cue , his gaze locked with hers . Locked and lingered a small eternity , long enough for her insides to roll over in fascinated trepidation . Every instinct of self-preservation told her he was bad news ; that she 'd live to rue the day she met him . Then he nodded , as though he knew exactly the effect he 'd had on her , and cutting a swath through the crowd , strode forward . <p> Given her first unobstructed view , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long legs , the way his black leather bomber jacket rode smoothly over his powerful shoulders , and the startling contrast of his throat rising strong and tanned against the open collar of his white shirt . As he drew closer , she saw , too , that his mouth and his jaw , the latter firm and faintly dusted with new beard shadow , betrayed the stubbornness his father had spoken of . <p> When he reached them , he asked in a voice as sinfully seductive as the rest of him , " So you beat the odds and made it back in one piece . How was the flight ? " <p> " Long , " Pavlos replied , sounding every bit as worn and weary as he surely must feel . Not even painkillers and the luxury of first-class air travel had been enough to cushion his discomfort . " Very long . But as you can see , I have my guardian angel at my side . " He reached over his shoulder , groped for her hand and squeezed it affectionately . " Emily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nikolaos . And this , Niko , is my nurse , Emily Tyler . What I would have done without her , I can not imagine . " <p> Again , Nikolaos Leonidas 's gaze lingered , touring the length of her in insolent appraisal . Behind his chiseled good looks lurked a certain arrogance . He was not a man to be crossed , she thought . " Yiasu , Emily Tyler , " he said . <p> Even though her sweater and slacks pretty much covered all of her , she felt naked under that sweeping regard . His eyes were the problem , she thought dizzily . Not brown like his father 's , as she 'd expected , but a deep green reminiscent of fine jade , they added an arresting final touch to a face already possessed of more than its rightful share of dark beauty . <p> Swallowing , she managed an answering , " Yiasu . " <p> " You speak a little Greek ? " <p> " A very little , " she said . " I just exhausted my entire vocabulary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> The comment might have stung if he had n't tempered it with a smile that assaulted her with such charm , it was all she could do not to buckle at the knees . For heaven 's sake , what was the matter with her ? She was twenty-seven , and if not exactly the most sexually experienced woman in the world , hardly in the first flush of innocent youth , either . She knew well enough that appearances counted for little . It was the person inside that mattered , and from everything she 'd been told , Niko Leonidas fell sadly short in that respect . <p> His manner as he turned his attention again to Pavlos did nothing to persuade her otherwise . He made no effort to embrace his father , to reassure him with a touch to the shoulder or hand that the old man could count on his son for whatever support he might need during his convalescence . Instead he commandeered a porter to take care of the loaded luggage cart one of the flight attendants had brought , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have exhausted the formalities , let 's get out of here , " marched toward the exit , leaving Emily to follow with Pavlos . <p> Only when they arrived at the waiting Mercedes did he betray a hint of compassion . " Do n't , " he ordered , when she went to help her patient out of the wheelchair and with surprising tenderness , scooped his father into his arms , laid him carefully on the car 's roomy back seat and draped a blanket over his legs . " You did n't have to do that , " Pavlos snapped , trying unsuccessfully to mask a grimace of pain . <p> Noticing , Niko said , " Apparently I did . Or would you have preferred I stand idly by and watch you fall on your face ? " <p> " I would prefer to be standing on my own two feet without needing assistance of any kind . " <p> " Then you should have taken better care of yourself when you were away  --  or else had the good sense to stay home in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before you die . " <p> Emily was tempted to kick the man , hard , but made do with a glare . " Accidents happen , Mr. Leonidas . " <p> " Especially to globe-trotting eighty-six-year-old men . " <p> " It was hardly his fault that the cruise ship ran aground , nor was he the only passenger on board who was injured . All things considered , and given his age , your father 's done amazingly well . In time , and with adequate follow-up physical therapy , he should make a reasonably good recovery . " <p> " And if he does n't ? " <p> " Then I guess you 're going to have to step up to the plate and start acting like a proper son . " <p> He favored her with a slow blink made all the more disturbing by the sweep of his lashes , which were indecently long and silky . " Nurse and family counselor all rolled into one , " he drawled . " How lucky is that ? " <p> " Well , you did ask . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tipped the porter , left him to return the airport 's borrowed wheelchair , then slammed closed the car trunk and opened the front passenger door with a flourish . " Climb in . We can continue this conversation later . " <p> As she might have expected , he drove with flair and expertise . Within half an hour of leaving the airport , they were cruising the leafy green streets of Vouliagmeni , the exclusive Athens suburb overlooking the Saronic Gulf on the east coast of the Attic Peninsula , which Pavlos had described to her so vividly . Soon after , at the end of a quiet road running parallel to the beach , Niko steered the car through a pair of ornate wrought-iron gates , which opened at the touch of a remote control button on the dash . <p> Emily had gathered Pavlos was a man of considerable wealth , but was hardly prepared for the rather frightening opulence confronting her as the Mercedes wound its way up a long curving driveway , and she caught her first sight of what ? His house ? Villa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounds and screened from local traffic by a stand of pines , the place defied such mundane description . Stucco walls , blind-ingly white , rose in elegant proportions to a tiled roof as blue as she 'd always imagined the skies to be in Athens , even though , this late September afternoon , an approaching storm left them gray and threatening . Long windows opened to wide terraces shaded by pergolas draped in flowering vines . A huge fountain splashed in a central forecourt , peacocks preened and screeched on the lawns , and from somewhere on the seaward side of the property , a dog barked . <p> She had little time to marvel , though , because barely had the car come to a stop outside a set of double front doors than they opened , and a man in his late fifties or early sixties appeared with a wheelchair light years removed from the spartan model offered by the airport . <p> The devoted butler , Georgios , she presumed . Pavlos had spoken of him often and with great fondness . Behind him came a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who went about unloading the luggage while Niko and the butler lifted Pavlos from the car to the chair . By the time they were done , he was gray in the face and the grooves paralleling his mouth carved more deeply than usual . <p> Even Niko seemed concerned . " What can you do for him ? " he muttered , cornering Emily near the front entrance as Georgios whisked his employer away down a wide , marble-floored hall . <p> " Give him something to manage the pain , and let him rest , " she said . " The journey was very hard on him . " <p> " He does n't look to me as if he was fit to travel in the first place . " <p> " He was n't . Given his age and the severity of his osteoporosis , he really ought to have remained in the hospital another week , but he insisted on coming home , and when your father makes up his mind , there 's no changing it . " <p> " Tell me something I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jacket . " Shall I send for his doctor ? " <p> " In the morning , yes . He 'll need more medication than what I was able to bring with us . But I have enough to see him through tonight . " Struggling to preserve a professional front despite the fact that Niko stood close enough for the warmth of his body to reach out and touch hers , she sidled past him and took her travel bag from the pile of luggage accumulating inside the front door . " If you 'd show me to his room , I really should attend to him now . " <p> He stepped away and led her to the back of the villa , to a large , sun-filled apartment on the main floor . Consisting of a sitting room and bedroom , both with French doors that opened onto a low-walled patio , it overlooked the gardens and sea . Still in the wheelchair , stationed next to the window in the sitting room , Pavlos leaned forward , drinking in the view which , even swathed in floating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " He had this part of the house converted into his private suite a few years ago when the stairs proved too much for him , " Niko said in a low voice . <p> Glancing through to the bedroom , Emily asked , " And the hospital bed ? " <p> " I had it brought in yesterday . He 'll probably give me hell for removing the one he 's used to , but this one seemed more practical , at least for now . " <p> " You did the right thing . He 'll be more comfortable in it , even if he wo n't be spending much time there except at night . " <p> " Why not ? " <p> " The more mobile he is , the better his chances of eventually walking again , although " <p> Picking up on the reservation in her voice , Niko pounced on it . " Although what ? You said earlier you expect him to make a reasonable recovery . Are you changing your mind now ? " <p> " No , but " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet aware that as his son , Niko had the right to some information , especially if her withholding it might have an adverse effect on Pavlos 's future well-being . " How much do you know about your father 's general health ? " <p> " Only what he chooses to tell me , which is n't very much . " <p> She should have guessed he 'd say that . There 's no need to contact my son , Pavlos had decreed , when the hospital had insisted on listing his next of kin . He minds his business , and I mind mine . <p> Niko pinned her in that unnerving green stare . " What are n't you telling me , Emily ? Is he dying ? " <p> " Are n't we all , to one extent or another ? " <p> " Do n't play mind games with me . I asked you a straightforward question . I 'd like a straightforward answer . " <p> " Okay . His age is against him . Although he 'd never admit it , he 's very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer a relapse . " <p> " I can pretty much figure that out for myself , so what else are you holding back ? " <p> Pavlos spared her having to reply . " What the devil are the pair of you whispering about ? " he inquired irascibly . <p> Casting Niko an apologetic glance , she said , " Your son was just explaining that you might not care for the new bed he ordered . He 's afraid you 'll think he was interfering . " <p> " He was . I broke my hip , not my brain . I 'll decide what I do and do n't need . " <p> " Not as long as I 'm in charge . " <p> " Do n't boss me around , girl . I wo n't put up with it . " <p> " Yes , you will , " she said equably . " That 's why you hired me . " <p> " I can fire you just as easily , and have you on a flight back to Vancouver as early as tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really was , she hid a smile . Exhaustion and pain had taken their toll , but by morning he 'd be in a better frame of mind . " Yes , sir , Mr. Leonidas , " she returned smartly , and swung the wheelchair toward the bedroom . " Until then , let me do my job . " <p> Niko had seized the first opportunity to vacate the premises , she noticed , and could have slapped herself for the pang of disappointment that sprouted despite her best efforts to quell it . The faithful Georgios , however , remained on the scene , anxious and willing to help wherever he could . Even so , by the time Pavlos had managed a light meal and was settled comfortably for the night , darkness had fallen . <p> Damaris , the housekeeper , showed Emily upstairs to the suite prepared for her . Decorated in subtle shades of ivory and slate-blue , it reminded her of her bedroom at home , although the furnishings here were far grander than anything she could afford . Marble floors , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exemplified wealth , good taste and comfort . <p> A lady 's writing desk occupied the space between double French doors leading to a balcony . In front of a small blue-tiled fireplace was a fainting couch , its brocade upholstery worn to satin softness , its once-vibrant colors faded by time . A glass-shaded lamp spilled mellow light , and a vase of lilies on a table filled the room with fragrance . <p> Most inviting of all , though , was the four-poster bed , dressed in finest linens . Almost ten thousand kilometers , and over sixteen hours of travel with its inevitable delays , plus the added stress of her patient 's condition , had made serous inroads on her energy , and she wanted nothing more than to lay her head against those snowy-white pillows , pull the soft coverlet over her body and sleep through to morning . <p> A quick glance around showed that her luggage had been unpacked , her toiletries arranged in the bathroom and her robe and nightshirt laid out on the bench in front of the vanity . But so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a freshly ironed cotton dress , one of the few she 'd brought with her , hung in the dressing room connecting bathroom and bedroom . And if they were n't indication enough that the early night she craved was not to be , Damaris 's parting remark drove home the point in no uncertain terms . <p> " I have drawn a bath for you , Despinis Tyler . Dinner will be served in the garden room at nine . " <br> Continues ...
