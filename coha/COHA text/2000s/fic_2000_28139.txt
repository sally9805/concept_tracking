Breakfast During the night something like a miracle happened : Jim 's age grew an extra digit . He was nine years old when he went to sleep , but ten years old when he woke up . The extra number had weight , like a muscle , and Jim hefted it like a prize . The uncles ' ages each contained two numbers , and now Jim 's age contained two numbers as well . He smiled and stretched and sniffed the morning . Wood smoke ; biscuits baking ; the cool , rivery smell of dew . Something not quite daylight looked in his window , and something not quite darkness stared back out . A tired cricket sang itself to sleep . The cricket had worked all night . Jim rose to meet the waiting day . Jim 's mother opened the stove door with a dishrag . Mama was tall and pale and handsome ; her neck was long and white . Although she was not yet thirty years old , she wore a long , black skirt that had belonged to her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but rather made the people in the room around her feel odd , as if they had wandered into an old photograph , and did not know how to behave . On the days Mama wore her mother 's long clothes , Jim did n't let the screen door slam . " There he is , " Mama said . " The birthday boy . " Jim 's heart rose up briefly , like a scrap of paper on a breath of wind , and then quickly settled back to the ground . His love for his mother was tethered by a sympathy Jim felt knotted in the dark of his stomach . The death of Jim 's father had broken something inside her that had not healed . She pulled the heaviness that had once been grief behind her like a plow . The uncles , the women of the church , the people of the town , hadlong since given up on trying to talk her into leaving the plow where it lay . Instead they grew used to stepping over , or walking inside , the deep furrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother was sad , and that he figured somehow in her sadness . When she leaned over to kiss him , the lilaced smell of her cheek was as sweet and sad at once as the smell of freshly turned earth in the churchyard . " Oh , Jimmy , " she said . " How in the world did you get to be ten years old ? " " I do n't know , Mama , " Jim said , which was the truth . He was as amazed by the fact as she was . He had been alive for ten years ; his father , who had also been named Jim Glass , had been dead for ten years and a week . It was a lot to think about before breakfast . Mama put the biscuits she pulled from the oven into a straw basket . Jim carried the basket into the dining room . The uncles sat around the long table . " Who 's that ? " Uncle Coran said . " I do n't know , " said Uncle Al . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Zeno . " Y'all know who I am , " said Jim . " Ca n't say that we do , " said Uncle Coran . " I 'm Jim . " " Howdy , " said Uncle Al . " Y'all stop it , " Jim said . The uncles were tall , skinny men with broad shoulders and big hands . Every morning they ate between them two dozen biscuits and a dozen scrambled eggs and a platter of ham . They washed it all down with a pot of black coffee and tall glasses of fresh milk . " Those biscuits you got there , Jim ? " said Uncle Zeno . Jim nodded . " Better sit down , then . " In all things Jim strove to be like the uncles . He ate biscuits and eggs until he thought he was going to be sick . When Uncle Zeno finally said , " You think you got enough to eat , Doc ? " Jim dropped his fork as if he had received a pardon . Uncle Zeno was Jim 's oldest uncle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Uncle Coran and Uncle Al were twins . Each of them swore that he did not look like the other one , which of course was n't true . They looked exactly alike , until you knew them , and sometimes even then . Not one of the uncles found it funny that they lived in identical houses . Uncle Al and Uncle Coran built their houses when they were young men , but , like Uncle Zeno , they never took wives . Most of the rooms in their houses did n't even have furniture ; only Uncle Zeno 's house had a cookstove . Jim 's mother cooked and cleaned for the uncles . When she said it was too much , the uncles hired a woman to help her . Uncle Coran ran the feed store and cotton gin . Uncle Al managed the farms . Uncle Zeno farmed with Uncle Al and operated the gristmill on Saturday mornings . As the head of the family he kept an eye on everyone else . Occasionally the uncles grew cross with each other , and , for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their houses immediately after supper . There they sat by their own fires , or on their own porches , and kept their own counsel until their anger passed . In general , however , everyone in the family got along well with everyone else ; to Jim , the sound of harsh words would always strike his ear as oddly as a hymn played in the wrong key . Jim patted his stomach . " That ought to hold me till dinner , " he said . " You ate a right smart , " Uncle Coran said . " Well , " said Jim , " I am ten years old now . " " My , my , " said Uncle Al . " I 've been thinking it 's about time for me to go to work with y'all , " Jim said . " Hmm , " said Uncle Zeno . " I thought maybe you could use some help hoeing that corn . " " We can usually put a good hand to work , " Uncle Zeno said . " You a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim . " You ai n't afraid to work ? " " No , sir . " " What do you say , boys ? " Uncle Zeno said . Uncle Al and Uncle Coran looked at each other . Uncle Coran winked . " He 'll do , I guess , " said Uncle Al . " Let 's get at it , then , " said Uncle Zeno.
