THERE MAY BE NOTHING NEW UNDER THE SUN after all . It 's been more than two millennia since a large ship went down off the coast of the Greek island of Antikythera , and more than a century since a sponge diver discovered the ship 's valuable cargo , which included bronze and marble statues , pottery , and glass and silver vases . But only now have researchers deciphered one of the wrecks  --  and classical archaeology 's  --  most enigmatic artifacts : a corroded collection or bronze and wood fragments known as the Antikythera Mechanism . <p> From early on , archaeologists identified pieces of inscribed gear wheels within the corroded lump , which led to the consensus that it was some sort of astronomical device . Throughout the twentieth century , from its home in the National Archaeological Museum in Athens , the Antikythera Mechanism attracted sporadic visits from archaeologists and historians who marveled at its highly complex , precise , hand-cut gear system and the undeciphered inscriptions on both the gears and wooden casing . The mechanism attracted sporadic scientific interest , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one could completely understand its nature . How exactly did it work , and for what had it been used ? Could such a sophisticated device have been created more than 1,400 years before similar objects were known to exist anywhere else in the world ? <p> Currently , the multinational Antikythera Mechanism Research Project ( AMRP ) , led by mathematician and filmmaker Tony Freeth , is using innovative imaging technology to answer these questions . After 4 years of trying , Freeth 's 17-person team of archaeologists , historians , and computer programmers , finally received permission from the museum to study the mechanism 's 7 main and 75 smaller fragments . The AMRP team was concerned that handling the 2,200-year-old device would irrevocably damage it , so they turned to technology . Innovative lighting techniques and 3-D X-ray computerized tomography ( CT ) have allowed the team to reconstruct the mechanisms gear functions and double the number of deciphered inscriptions , giving a view into an ancient world that had much more knowledge about the solar system than previously thought . <p> Researchers are now confident the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both lunar and solar eclipses . ( Although often called the worlds first computer , it should actually be termed a calculator , argues the project 's head archaeologist Mike Edmunds , since it can add , subtract , and divide , but can not be programmed . ) The AMRP has also been able to correct previous reconstructions of the gear trains and confirm that the device has a mechanical display of planetary positions that appears to follow the theories of Hipparchus , founder of a school of astronomy on the island of Rhodes in the second century B.C. Hipparchus realized that the moon 's unusual positions in the sky arc caused by us elliptical orbit , a theory demonstrated by the mechanism 's complicated planetary alignments . While some of the pottery from the Antikythera shipwreck is known to have come from Rhodes , the mechanism 's creator and origin are still unknown . <p> Five years ago , while tinkering around with some imaging techniques in his basement , Thomas Malzbender , a senior research scientist at Hewlett Packard ( HP ) Labs in California , crafted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking 40 photos of a crumpled-up newspaper  --  using the dome to change the angle of the light from a table lamp each time  --  he found that he could enhance the newspapers appearance on the computer to which he was feeding the images . Excited by the outcome , I Malzbender and colleague Dan Gelb built an automated geodesic dome with interior flashbulbs that can take 50 photos in rapid succession . This led to the refinement of reflectance imaging , a photographic technique for capturing multiple views of ' a surface under different lighting conditions . These views can be incorporated into models and altered to enhance surface details that were previously impossible to see . According to Malzbender , the beauty of this technique is that it is very accessible . " All you are really doing is varying the light source . The technology is very understandable and does not require a great deal of equipment . The applications for archaeological work , as well as forensics , paleontology , graphics , and so on are endless . " <p> While en route to Athens with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first archaeological application of his technique . " A few years ago I worked on several ancient cuneiform tablets from the Sumerian site of Umma . I photographed the first tablet until 2 a.m. in my basement and right away I could see the fingerprints of the scribe from 4,000 years ago . That was an incredible moment for me . As soon as I saw the Antikythera Mechanism I knew the technique would work perfectly on its corroded surface . " <p> At the National Museum , the HP imagers spent a week of 10-hour days photographing the mechanism , creating a portfolio of 4,500 images in all . Once the AMRP team had superior photos of the surface , how would they get inside the Antikythera Mechanism without damaging it ? They turned to X-Tek , a British company specializing in microfocus X-ray sources , and to Andrew Ramsey , a ( Cambridge-trained physicist who specializes in imaging software . Ramsey and his team settled on using 3-D X-ray computerized tomography ( CT ) for examining the Antikythera Mechanism , the same technology as the CT scan used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very small ( " microfocus " ) X-ray source and a very large detector , which allowed them to greatly magnify the image . Ramsey described it " like the large shadow of your hand on a distant wall when it is close to a small candle flame . " The X-rays pass directly through the sample . Images taken from all angles during a 360-degree rotation are then fed into a computer to compose a 3-D image that allows the researcher literally to " see " inside the object . <p> Using eight tons of machinery originally designed for examining aircraft turbine blades , the team " peeled away " the mechanisms layers of compressed metal and wood , and for the first time counted the gears ( they have identified 30 ) and the teeth on the gears , and reconstructed the mechanism 's interior in a way never before possible . Because the Antikythera Mechanism is so corroded , the team from X-Tek found it easier to work with than expected . " We actually got more X-rays through the mechanism than expected , resulting in more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced by corrosion products that are lower density allowing for a higher-density beam to pass through than the original bronze , " says Ramsey . <p> But after taking images for several days , Ramsey realized that he was not just looking at the gears , but also at letters punched into the surface of the bronze plates . " I felt a bit like Indiana Jones . I knew right away that the text was astronomical as there were names of stars and planets that I recognized from my physics classes , but I could n't understand much of it , " says Ramsey , adding that AMRP had epigraphists and astronomers on hand who immediately recognized the significance of the Greek inscriptions and translated them on the spot . <p> The AMRP has doubled the amount of legible letters from 923 to 2,160 individual characters previously hidden under surface encrustations or on the inside of the mechanism and its components . This allows researchers to say conclusively that the inscription on the outside of the box is a kind of instruction manual , describing parts of the device along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought that this would be a rather dry mathematical analysis of gear-wheel tooth counts . We never dreamed we would actually read about how to use the mechanism in the texts , " marvels Ramsey . <p> But the high-tech work does not end there . Other researchers from the AMRP are working on an online 3-D simulation model that will be combined with a program that simulates the positions of the planets , moon , sun , and stars in the year 100 B.C. Researchers will be able to operate the Antikythera Mechanism virtually and to see the solar system at the time the device was created . And there is much discussion of how best to display both the artifact and virtual re-creations of it in the National Museum . <p> According to Mike Edmunds , " The astronomy encoded in the mechanism is exactly right for what we know about the state of astronomical knowledge at the time of its manufacture . The main calendrical and eclipse functions come from Babylonian astronomy , which was absorbed into Greek astronomy by the time . " But we are still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science ? Navigational purposes ? Edmunds adds " I feel great wonder at the sophistication and ingenuity of the mechanism 's designer . There is nothing like it until the astronomical clocks of the Middle Ages . I am delighted that we have been able to reveal more about this extraordinary device .
