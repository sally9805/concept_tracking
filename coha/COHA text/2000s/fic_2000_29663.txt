All that you touch You Change . All that you Change Changes you . The only lasting truth Is Change . God Is Change . Earthseed : The Books of the Living SATURDAY , JULY 20 , 2024 I had my recurring dream last night . I guess I should have expected it . It comes to me when I strugglewhen I twist on my own personal hook and try to pretend that nothing unusual is happening . It comes to me when I try to be my father 's daughter . Today is our birthdaymy fifteenth and my father 's fifty-fifth . Tomorrow , I 'll try to please himhim and the community and God . So last night , I dreamed a reminder that it 's all a lie . I think I need to write about the dream because this particular lie bothers me so much . I 'm learning to fly , to levitate myself . No one is teaching me . I 'm just learning on my own , little by little , dream lesson by dream lesson . Not a very subtle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many lessons , and I 'm better at flying than I used to be . I trust my ability more now , but I 'm still afraid . I ca n't quite control my directions yet . I lean forward toward the doorway . It 's a doorway like the one between my room and the hall . It seems to be a long way from me , but I lean toward it . Holding my body stiff and tense , I let go of whatever I 'm grasping , whatever has kept me from rising or falling so far . And I lean into the air , straining upward , not moving upward , but not quite falling down either . Then I do begin to move , as though to slide on the air drifting a few feet above the floor , caught between terror and joy . I drift toward the doorway . Cool , pale light glows from it . Then I slide a little to the right ; and a little more . I can see that I 'm going to miss the door and hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or turn . I drift away from the door , away from the cool glow into another light . The wall before me is burning . Fire has sprung from nowhere , has eaten in through the wall , has begun to reach toward me , reach for me . The fire spreads . I drift into it . It blazes up around me . I thrash and scramble and try to swim back out of it , grabbing handfuls of air and fire , kicking , burning ! Darkness . Perhaps I awake a little . I do sometimes when the fire swallows me . That 's bad . When I wake up all the way , I ca n't get back to sleep . I try , but I 've never been able to . This time I do n't wake up all the way . I fade into the second part of the dream- - the part that 's ordinary and real , the part that did happen years ago when I was little , though at the time it did n't seem to matter . Darkness . Darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , glinting light . " We could n't see so many stars when I was little , " my stepmother says to me . She speaks in Spanish , her own first language . She stands still and small , looking up at the broad sweep of the Milky Way . She and I have gone out after dark to take the washing down from the clothesline . The day has been hot , as usual , and we both like the cool darkness of early night . There 's no moon , but we can see very well . The sky is full of stars . The neighborhood wall is a massive , looming presence nearby . I see it as a crouching animal , perhaps about to spring , more threatening than protective . But my stepmother is there , and she is n't afraid . I stay close to her . I 'm seven years old . I look up gt thestars and the deep , black sky . " Why could n't you see the stars ? " I ask her . " Everyone can see them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's taught me . It 's an intimacy somehow . " City lights , " she says . " Lights , progress , growth , all those things we 're too hot and too poor to bother with anymore . " She pauses . " When I was your age , my mother told me that the starsthe few stars we could seewere windows into heaven . Windows for God to look through to keep an eye on us . I believed her for almost a year . " My stepmother hands me an armload of my youngest brother 's diapers . I take them , walk back toward the house where she has left her big wicker laundry basket , and pile the diapers atop the rest of the clothes . The basket is full . I look to see that my stepmother is not watching me , then let myself fall backward onto the soft mound of stiff , clean clothes . For a moment , the fall is like floating . I lie there , looking up at the stars . I pick out some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've learned them from an astronomy book that belonged to my father 's mother . I see the sudden light streak of a meteor flashing westward across the sky . I stare after it , hoping to see another . Then my stepmother calls me and I go back to her . " There are city lights now , " I say to her . " They do n't hide the stars . " She shakes her head . " There are n't anywhere near as many as there were . Kids today have no idea what a blaze of light cities used to beand not that long ago . " " I 'd rather have the stars , " I say . " The stars are free . " She shrugs . " I 'd rather have the city lights back myself , the sooner the better . But we can afford the stars . "
