She went out for cigarettes . That 's my favorite detail of the story told by Ashley Smith . It was not a noble calling ; it was n't even a noble errand . But the craving for nicotine at 2 o'clock in the morning apparently led Smith into the loaded gun of one Brian Nichols , a man who was wanted for raping one woman and murdering another woman and three men . According to Smith , Nichols forced her into her apartment , tied her up , put her in the bathtub and told her , " I 'm not going to hurt you if you just do what I say . " <P> What would you do under those circumstances ? Scream ? Panic ? Beg ? But at that point , something else intervened . Smith actually communicated with her captor . She says she saw him not as a monster but as a human being . She talked with him . She told her story  --  how her husband had been stabbed in a dispute and had died in her arms , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught for speeding and drunken driving , had been arrested for assault ( the charges were dropped ) , had ceded custody of her young daughter to her aunt . She showed him her wounds as a human being . And she saw in that man his own wounded soul . <P> It would be politically correct to describe that encounter as a spiritual one . But it seems to me it was more than that . It was , in the minds and souls of both human beings , an encounter with God . Smith 's weapon , it appears , was a hugely popular book , The Purpose Driven Life , by Rick Warren , an unabashedly Christian guide to making it through life 's highs and lows by constantly asking what God has intended for you . The book is indeed a powerful one  --  precisely because it insists on the notion that God knows all of us intimately , especially sinners . Smith says she read from chapter 33 , which centers on the role of Christian service , on the idea that in every moment there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell what they are by what they do " is one of the chapter 's inscriptions from Matthew 's Gospel . <P> Smith , blessed by what can only be called grace , saw that terrifying early morning in suburban Atlanta as one of those opportunities . Warren writes in that chapter , " Great opportunities to serve never last long . They pass quickly , sometimes never to return again . You may only get one chance to serve that person , so take advantage of that moment . " Smith did . By her account , she talked to him , made breakfast , told him her story , listened . And as she revealed her openness to grace , so , apparently , did he . " He said he thought I was an angel sent from God and that I was his sister and he was my brother in Christ and that he was lost , and God led him right to me , " Smith said . Maybe he was right . <P> We latch onto this story not just because it 's a riveting end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uplifted by the sordid ordinariness of it all . He was an alleged rapist and murderer . She was tied up in a bathtub , clinging to the wreckage of a life that was barely afloat . One was a monster , the other a woman unable to care for her 5-year-old , looking for cigarettes in the dark . And out of that came something , well , beautiful . He saw his purpose : to serve God in prison , to turn his life around , even as it may have been saturated in the blood and pain of others . She saw hers : to make that happen . These people were n't saints . Grace arrives , unannounced , in lives that least expect or deserve it .
