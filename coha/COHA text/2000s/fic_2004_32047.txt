The Voices By Susan Elderkin Grove Atlantic , Inc . Susan Elderkin Prologue the voices it comes from the inland desert A warm wind is blowing tonight . It comes from the inland desert and it 's heavy with red dust , handfuls scooped up and cradled tight against its chest . So far the plain has been as seemingly endless and without modulation as an ocean at sleep : crowns of spinifex hug the flat ; the occasional sun-bitten gum tree , stripped of its leaves , reaches out of the earth like a claw . But now a sandstone escarpment rises from nowhere like a submarine emerging from the deep , and the wind pulls up short , whirls around in an eddy of indecision , sprinkling a little of its precious cargo on the land . Which way will it go ? First it gusts to the right , then to the left , and here , sheltering within a patch of grey box and scraggy cabbage gums it finds a crooked tin roof rusted to a pink and orange patchwork . It circles the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the back , plays at bellying the curtain in and out . Then slips inside . It 's a small , square room . Rectangles of white-bordered posters glimmer through the mealy grey air . Their edges snake where they have n't been fully stuck down . Along a shelf is a row of stones , small enough to fit in the palm of a child 's hand . Near the far wall a spray of blond hair crouches on a pillow like a spider . There 's the sound of shallow , fretful breath . Suddenly the hair flies into the air , hangs suspended for a moment like a ball at the top of its toss , then drops back down again - a fresh corner of pillow this time , a little cooler than before . Maybe now he 'll be able to get to sleep . But no : a second later the hair flies up again , an elbow jabbing angrily at the sheet . This is Billy , we say . Ah , says the wind , so this is him . What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat ? No , no , he 's used to that . Was I making too much noise in the cabbage gums ? No more than usual . Look , just there , on the bridge of his nose . See that dent ? Like a drawstring tugged tight ? Yes . A gathering up of his confusion ? That 's right . All the unanswered questions . I see , says the wind . No wonder he ca n't sleep . Quite . Still do n't know what you lot are bothering with him for . Though curious enough at first , the wind does n't really care about this boy - and why should it ? It has no need of people ; it does n't depend on them like we do . Instead it curls around the room looking for something to disturb , a loose sheet of paper to flutter to the floor , a pencil to roll off a chair . But the contents of this room are disappointingly static . On the floor by the bed is a thin , hardback book called The Universe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . On its cover is a picture of the planet : swirls of white and blue and green like blobs of ink twirled round with a nib , and all around it is the perfect blackness that sets the scenes for this boy 's nightmares - more like sensations than nightmares , when gravity has lost its hold and he 's falling through space , arms lashing out for something to hold onto , all the time falling faster and faster and still the blackness goes on , plenty more where that came from - ah yes , an infinite supply . Will it ever come to an end ? We 've all had dreams like that , sneers the wind . They are n't anything special . But this boy beneath the sheet , this boy that we are starting to love , has more than his fair share of solitary fears . He is small for his age , skinny . The wind ruffles the edge of the sheet so that we can get a peek - yes , there it lies , meek and pale as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day now he will turn the corner , sprout hair , an Adam 's apple budding in his throat , those arms and legs shooting out and down until they 're long and gangly with heavy hands and feet on the ends - just like his father 's , too big and clumsy to be much use . But he 's not quite ready yet . A thin arm whips up as he flings himself onto his back , exposing a slight , honey-brown torso , ribs showing through like the roots of a tree . Fingers curled on the pillow , as if he wants to ask a question . Excuse me , Mrs Tucker , I do n't understand . What do n't you understand , Billy ? Any of it . What do you mean , any of it ? Her irritation curbs his confidence but does n't shut him up completely . What we 're doing here . What it 's all about . Who ' re supposed to go to for the answers . See the anxious eyeball flickering beneath the lid ? It is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gets some answers . And who can blame him ? Not us . Certainly not us . Such ridiculous questions , mutters Mrs Tucker . It does n't make sense , that 's all . How am I supposed to know what 's right and what 's wrong ? I do n't know who to ask . Even as we watch he begins to slip , the muscles in his cheeks sliding into softness , the delicate mouth crushed against the pillow where a little pool of dribble will collect before morning . In a snap of a finger , he 's gone . Ah , what a shame , Billy , we appear to have run out of time . Jiss have to wait until tomorrow , wo n't we ? Rebutted by Mrs Tucker , the useless cow . Before our eyes , the unconscious body draws its extremities in towards the warmer core : the knees pulling up , the elbows folding in , the freckled nose burrowing down . And so the questions draw in too , their curious searchlights aimed now at his steadily thumping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will just have to make do with whatever they can find inside him : instincts , primeval knowledge - whatever they call them these days . Perhaps they will be found stencilled into the walls of his gut , secreted down blood-red tunnels , tucked inside folds of tissue like fossils . A tightly twisted spiral of a snail shell preserved in all its wondrous detail . Palaeozoic , Mesozoic , Cenozoic . All these epochs hidden inside the body of little Billy Saint . The bridge of his nose is smooth now , perfect as the bowl of a spoon . And the wind is bored . There 's nothing to play with here and it wants to move on - it 's what winds do , after all - and we 'll go with it , although we 'll be back to see this boy again . Once we 've made up our minds , we never back down - and anyway , who are we to be choosy these days ? The wind takes one last spin around the room and then , childishly , when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posters so that it flops right off the wall , doubling over in a little thunderclap of stiff paper , and the boy sits bolt upright in his bed , blinking in surprise , sees nothing but a disembodied square of pale curtain floating at the window , hears a quick rustling of the gum trees outside . And then everything goes quiet . part I part I 7 the largest pair of knees - How long you gunna take to fill that bedpan ? He opens his eyes to find himself confronted by the largest pair of knees he has ever seen . They are bold and black , the skin paler where it 's stretched over the humps , darker in the dips and hollows . They are not a perfect pair : the left is more bulbous than the right . It is as if they had been crafted by hand . His eyes travel upwards . Thick , folded arms struggle to extricate themselves from beneath a heavy wedge of breast . When he reaches her face he sees that she is a full-blood . Her solid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overhang of a cliff . The nurse squints up at a bag of saline hanging from a metal stand . A plastic tube dangles down and disappears beneath a bandage on the back of his hand . Her lips move , counting drips . Four , five , six . Nine , ten , eleven . Then she flicks up the edge of his sheet with a finger and gives a small , breathy cry of exasperation . - Get a move on , wontcha . She is sharp with her high-pitched words , as if they are prickles in her mouth she has to spit out . He turns away from her , mortified . It 's the position . Want me to get it moving ? Out of the corner of his eye , he can see that she is wriggling her forefinger : a child 's imitation of a mouse . Instinctively , he jerks his buttocks away and almost slips off the pan . Ya kiddin . She waits just long enough for him to realise his mistake . You bet I am . You 'd hev @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his face , practically licks her lips at it . Eyelids lowered to contain her satisfaction , she turns her body in the way that heavy people do , moving the chair to one side to save herself the job of stepping around it , and saunters off , her high-boned arse swilling from side to side like brandy in a glass . She 's smiling to herself , he can tell . At the door of the ward she looks around and sniggers again . Cecily thinks the whole business is hilariously funny . Billy ca n't remember the last time he gave someone so much cause for amusement . He knows her name is Cecily because she has a badge pinned to her uniform . It hitches up the thin cotton fabric so that one breast looks higher than the other . The uniform is made of pale-blue graph-paper hatches . He has an urge to use her name - both out of a desire to feel those Cs on his tongue , and to show that he likes her , that he might soften for her - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's not one to force these things . She reminds him of the women from back home , with her harsh voice and her air of absolute disinterest in what 's going on around her . She has a way of standing still amid the scurrying , her gaze skimming the tops of people 's heads . Cecily . It does n't suit her one bit , he decides , the hard rim of the bedpan digging into his coccyx . Far too delicate , ethereal a name for someone so solid , so real . A woman in a flapping white doctor 's coat , her hair scraped back in a severe bun , sits on the edge of his bed and looks at him with unconcealed impatience . She has introduced herself simply as Ann , as if everyone should know who Ann is , what Ann does . Only by scrutinising her badge does he discover that she 's a psychiatric consultant , and that her full name is Ann Gould . Billy responds with contempt : she , after all , is the one who talks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you remember ? she asks , rearranging the pink and green forms on her clipboard . Billy 's not in the mood . He suspects that any probing will push his already sketchy memories even further into the shadows . But she presses him , says there 's a cop coming along shortly who will bully him into giving a story , any story , so he might as well get one worked out . She prompts him , as if he were a child . This incident on the train . There was a fight , yes ? Surely the other bloke 's filled you in already . - I need to hear your side of the story . The hows and whys of it . I 'm not a fucken philosopher . She raises the narrow arcs of her plucked eyebrows , lets the disdain spill freely from her eyes . Bullies come in many disguises , he thinks . He sighs . Yeh , we had a fight , he says . We ? That man , the American tourist , and me . Describe him , please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Video camera slung over ' is shoulder . White knee-high socks , freckled thighs . About as much subtlety in him as a fork-lift . He tails off , fragments of memory beginning to surface now . He lets them go , a separate strand from the story he is going to tell her . Go on . He would n't get out of me way . He was sittin in me seat . Sitting in your seat ? But you did n't have a seat - - And so you had to hit the bugger , interjects Cecily . Unseen by either of them , the black nurse has crept into the curtained-off cubicle and is rearranging the glass of water and box of tissues on his bedside table , even though neither has been touched . Evidently she had n't wanted to miss Billy 's account . - He was that shocked you 'd have thought he did n't know what fists were for ! She is holding back a snigger but it escapes , a little gumpf of a snort , and she decides to give in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her eye . - Oh , you shoulda seen his face when they brought im in ! It was like ' e was saying , This was n't in the tourist brochure ! Billy can sense a stiffening in Ann 's body at the foot of his bed , forcing herself to sit out this interruption in good humour . Her pointed features are pinched shut like the clasp on a purse . Cecily - - Seemed to think Billy had bin planted out in the bush for their entertainment , part of the tourist show . Out to your left is a wild bushman , a very lucky sighting , you do n't see em often . Cecily , I want to hear Mr Saint 's version of events . She nods at Billy . Go on . Billy shrugs . He was enjoying Cecily 's jokes . - I do n't remember any more , he says . Everyone was staring at me . I do n't know why . Ann cocks her head . - I can tell you why , Mr Saint . You were blistered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The driver of the Ghan Express saw you lying between the steel sleepers , as though you were waiting either to be hit by the train or to be carried back towards civilisation . Towards life . If he had n't been going so slowly it would certainly have been the former . I do n't think you appreciate how lucky you are . Cecily is blowing her nose now with a cotton hanky and Billy smiles as he watches her blocking one nostril and then the other . She does n't look like the women back west any more . She is just a nurse , at home enough here to disrupt the doctor 's interrogation and not care . Billy is impressed by her , how she has found a niche for herself in this white institution , hoisting herself firmly out of no-man's-land and dumping her bulky frame down here as if she had never doubted her right to it all along . - I was thirsty , Billy says quietly . I did n't want to die . I was looking for a drink of water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She bores in with her determined eyes . Billy turns away , scrutinises the cream and tan geometric pattern on the curtains by his bed . Do you remember anything else at all , Mr Saint ? Yeh , I do . They were playing Casablanca on TV . Afterwards , Cecily wheels him to the bathroom and positions him squarely in front of a full-length mirror . She says she wants to get him neatened up before the cop arrives . The bathroom is a large , rectangular room , fitted out for the elderly and infirm - metal rails either side of the toilet , a raised plastic seat . Billy had n't thought he 'd find himself using a bathroom like this just yet . He slouches in silence while she opens a cabinet and takes out a pressurised can . She squirts a ball of foam on to her palm and offers it to him as if he were a horse , a white cloud cupped beneath his mouth . He sits there sullenly , intent on his humiliation . She waits a full half minute then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his jaw . Specks of it spray out like the froth of a wave hitting rock . Continues ... by Susan Elderkin
