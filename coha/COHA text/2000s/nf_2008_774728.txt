Home // I was born in St. Louis , Missouri , but from the age of three I grew up in Stamps , Arkansas , with my paternal grandmother , Annie Henderson , and my father ? s brother , Uncle Willie , and my only sibling , my brother , Bailey . // At thirteen I joined my mother in San Francisco . Later I studied in New York City . Throughout the years I have lived in Paris , Cairo , West Africa , and all over the United States . // Those are facts , but facts , to a child , are merely words to memorize , " My name is Johnny Thomas . My address is 220 Center Street . " All facts , which have little to do with the child ? s truth . // My real growing up world , in Stamps , was a continual struggle against a condition of surrender . Surrender first to the grown up human beings who I saw every day , all black and all very , very large . Then submission to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who I saw rarely . // Without knowing why exactly , I did not believe that I was inferior to anyone except maybe my brother . I knew I was smart , but I also knew that Bailey was smarter , maybe because he reminded me often and even suggested that maybe he was the smartest person in the world . He came to that decision when he was nine years old . // The South , in general , and Stamps , Arkansas , in particular had had hundreds of years ? experience in demoting even large adult blacks to psychological dwarfs . Poor white children had the license to address lauded and older blacks by their first names or by any names they could create . // Thomas Wolfe warned in the title of America ? s great novel that " You Can ? t Go Home Again . " I enjoyed the book but I never agreed with the title . I believe that one can never leave home . I believe that one carries the shadows , the dreams , the fears and dragons of home under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones eyes and possibly in the gristle of the earlobe. // Home is that youthful region where a child is the only real living inhabitant . Parents , siblings , and neighbors , are mysterious apparitions , who come , go , and do strange unfathomable things in and around the child , the region ? s only enfranchised citizen . // Geography , as such , has little meaning to the child observer . If one grows up in the Southwest , the desert and open skies are natural . New York , with the elevators and subway rumble and millions of people , and Southeast Florida with its palm trees and sun and beaches are to the children of those regions , the ways the outer world are , has been , and will always be . Since the child can not control that environment , she has to find her own place , a region where only she lives and no one else can enter . // I am convinced that most people do not grow up . We find parking spaces and honor our credit cards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing up . I think what we do is mostly grow old . We carry accumulation of years in our bodies and on our faces , but generally our real selves , the children inside , are still innocent and shy as magnolias. // We may act sophisticated and worldly but I believe we feel safest when we go inside ourselves and find home , a place where we belong and maybe the only place we really do . // 2 // Philanthropy // To write about giving to a person who is naturally generous reminds me of a preacher passionately preaching to the already committed choir . I am encouraged to write on because I remember that from time to time , the choir does need to be uplifted and thanked for its commitment . Those voices need to be encouraged to sing again and again , with even more emotion . // Each single American giver keeps alive the American Cancer Society , the Red Cross , Salvation Army , Goodwill , Sickle Cell Anemia , American Jewish Society , NAACP , and the Urban League . The list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Temple associations , Buddhist shrines , groups , officials , and city and social clubs . However , the largest sums of money come from philanthropists. // The word philanthropy was taken from the two Greek words , philo  --  lover of ; and anthro  --  mankind . So , philanthropists are lovers of humanity . They build imposing edifices for people to work in and to play in . They give huge sums of money to support organizations which offer better health and education to the society . They are the principal patrons of the arts . // The mention of philanthropy elicits smiles , followed by the sensation of receiving unexpected good fortune from a generous but faceless source . // There are those who would like to see themselves as philanthropists . Philanthropists often are represented by committees and delegations . They are disconnected from the recipients of their generosity . I am not a member of that gathering . Rather I like to think of myself as charitable . The charitable say in effect , " I seem to have more than I need and you seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to share my excess with you . " Fine , if my excess is tangible , money or goods , and fine if not , for I learned that to be charitable with gestures and words can bring enormous joy and repair injured feelings . // My paternal grandmother who raised me had a remarkable influence on how I saw the world and how I reckoned my place in it . She was the picture of dignity . She spoke softly and walked slowly , with her hands behind her back , fingers laced together . I imitated her so successfully that neighbors called me her shadow . // " Sister Henderson , I see you got your shadow with you again . " // Grandmother would look at me and smile . " Well , I guess you ? re right . If I stop , she stops . If I go , she goes . " // When I was thirteen , my grandmother took me back to California to join my mother , and she returned immediately to Arkansas . The California house was a world away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My mother wore her straight hair in a severe stylish bob . My grandmother didn ? t believe in hot curling women ? s hair , so I had grown up with a braided natural . Grandmother turned our radio on to listen to the news , religious music , Gang Busters , and The Lone Ranger . In California my mother wore lipstick and rouge and played loud blues music and jazz on a record player . Her house was full of people who laughed a lot and talked loudly . I definitely did not belong . I walked around in that worldly atmosphere , with my hands clasped behind my back , my hair pulled back in a tight braid , humming a Christian song . // My mother watched me for about two weeks . Then we had what was to become familiar as , " a sit down talk to . " // She said , " Maya , you disapprove of me because I am not like your grandmother . That ? s true . I am not . But I am your mother and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy you good clothes and give you well-prepared food and keep this roof over your head . When you go to school , the teacher will smile at you and you will smile back . Other students you don ? t even know will smile and you will smile . But on the other hand , I am your mother . I tell you what I want you to do . If you can force one smile on your face for strangers , do it for me . I promise you I will appreciate it . " // She put her hand on my cheek and smiled . " Come on baby , smile for mother . Come on . " // She made a funny face and against my wishes , I smiled . She kissed me on the lips and started to cry . // " That ? s the first time I have seen you smile . It is a beautiful smile , Mother ? s beautiful daughter can smile . " // I had never been called beautiful and no one in my memory had ever called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could be a giver by simply bringing a smile to another person . The ensuing years have taught me that a kind word , a vote of support is a charitable gift . I can move over and make another place for someone . I can turn my music up if it pleases , or down if it is annoying . // I may never be known as a philanthropist , but I certainly am a lover of mankind , and I will give freely of my resources . // I am happy to describe myself as charitable . // 3 // Revelations // It had to be the days of Revelations . The days John the revelator prophesied . The earth shuddered as trains thundered up and down in its black belly . Private cars , taxis , buses , surface trains , trucks , delivery vans , cement mixers , delivery carts , bicycles , and skates occupied the air with honks , toots , roars , thuds , screams , and whistles , until the very air seemed thick and lumpy like bad gravy . // People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town to watch the end and the beginning of the world . // I wanted to forget about the enormity of the day so , I went to the Fillmore Street 5 &amp; Dime store . It was an acre wide shop where dreams hung on plastic stands . I had walked up and down its aisles a thousand times over . I knew its seductive magic . From the nylon slips with cardboard tits to the cosmetic counter where lipsticks and nail polish were pink and red and green and blue fruits fallen from a rainbow tree . // That was the city , when I was sixteen and brand-new like daybreak . // The day was so important I could hardly breathe . // A boy who lived up the street from me had been asking me to be intimate with him . I had refused for months . He was not my boyfriend . We were not even dating . // It was during that time that I noticed my body ? s betrayal . My voice became deep and husky , and my naked image in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and curvy. // I was already six feet tall and had no breasts . I thought maybe if I had sex my recalcitrant body would grow up and behave as it was supposed to behave . // That morning the boy had telephoned and I told him yes . He gave me an address and said he would meet me there at 8:00 o ? clock . I said yes . // A friend had lent him his apartment . From the moment I saw him at the door I knew I had made the wrong choice . There were no endearments spoken , no warm caresses shared . // He showed me to a bedroom , where we both undressed . The fumbling engagement lasted fifteen minutes , and I had my clothes on and was at the front door . // I don ? t remember if we said goodbye . // I do remember walking down the street , wondering was that all there was and how much I wanted a long soaking bath . I did get the bath and that was not all there was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy . The birth of my son caused me to develop enough courage to invent my life . // I learned to love my son without wanting to possess him and I learned how to teach him to teach himself . // Today , over forty years later , when I look at him and see the wonderful man he has become , the loving husband and father , the good poet and fine novelist , the responsible citizen and the world ? s greatest son , I thank the Creator that he was given to me . The Revelation is that day , so long ago , was the greatest day of my life  --  Hallelujah ! // 4 // Giving Birth // My brother Bailey told me to keep my pregnancy a secret from my mother . He said she would take me out of school . I was very close to graduating . Bailey said I had to have a high school diploma before mother returned to San Francisco from the nightclub she and her husband owned in Nome , Alaska . // I received my diploma on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had patted me on the shoulder that morning and said , " You are growing up and you are becoming a fine young woman . " I thought to myself I should , I am eight months and one week pregnant . // After a salutary dinner celebrating his birthday , my graduation , and a national victory , I left a note on his pillow saying , " Dad , I am sorry to bring disgrace to the family , but I have to tell you that I am pregnant . " I didn ? t sleep that night . // I heard my dad go to his room about 3:00 a.m . When he didn ? t knock on my door immediately , I puzzled over whether he had seen and read the note . There would be no sleep for me that night . // At 8:30 in the morning he spoke at my door . He said , " Baby , come down and have coffee with me , by the way  --  I got your note . " // The sound of him walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heart racing . Downstairs at the table he said , " I ? m going to call your mother . How far along are you ? " // I said , " I have three weeks . " // He smiled . " I ? m sure your mother will be here today . " // Nervous and frightened are not words which even barely describe how I was feeling . // Before nightfall my pretty little mother walked into the house . She gave me a kiss then looked at me . " You ? re more than any three weeks pregnant . " // I said , " No ma ? am , I ? m eight months and one week pregnant . " // She asked , " Who is the boy ? " I told her . // She asked , " Do you love him ? " // I said , " No. " // " Does he love you ? " // I said , " No , he ? s the only person with whom I had sex and we were together only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no reason to ruin three lives ; our family is going to have a wonderful baby . " // She was a registered nurse so when I began labor she shaved me , powdered me and took me to the hospital . The doctor had not arrived . Mother introduced herself to the nurses and said as a nurse herself , she was going to help with the delivery . // She crawled up on the delivery table with me and had me bend my legs . She put her shoulder against my knee and told me dirty stories . When the pains came she told me the punch line of the stories and as I laughed , she told me , " Bear down . " // When the baby started coming , my little mother jumped off the table and seeing him emerge , she shouted , " Here he comes and he has black hair . " I wondered what color she thought he might have . // When the baby was delivered , my mother caught him . She and the other nurses cleaned him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . " Here my baby , here ? s your beautiful baby . " // My dad said when she returned home , she was so tired , she looked as if she had given birth to quintuplets. // She was so proud of her grandson and proud of me . I never had to spend one minute regretting giving birth to a child who had a devoted family led by a fearless , doting , and glorious grandmother . So I became proud of myself . //
