Vladimir Putin is a man possessed . He wants to rebuild a strong Russia with a powerful presidency and a flourishing economy . He is determined to crush separatism in Chechnya or anywhere else within Russia 's borders . But first and foremost , he wants to end a decade of deep Russian despair . These are dramatic and ambitious goals but they are not new . Since Peter the Great , Russia 's leaders have come to power dreaming of sweeping reforms . Most have ended up disappointed , thwarted by the country 's unwieldiness and its bureaucrats ' subtle sabotage . Despite Putin 's refusal to offer explicit policies and his aides ' admission that their programs are not ready to be implemented , expectations are growing that Putin will mark the start of his presidency with a series of dramatic gestures  --  among them , perhaps , a crackdown on high-level corruption . What is not clear is whether this will be a break with the sleazy Yeltsin past or simply window dressing . <P> Putin has already made headway in one area : restoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coarse style and energetic demeanor have so galvanized the electorate that he is all but a lock to swing into office as President  --  barring an unexpectedly low turnout or a last-minute erosion of popularity . <P> But even before the election , Putin has begun quietly dropping hints about how he views the state of affairs in Russia today . He knows it is a mess . He pledges loyalty to the man who gave him power , Boris Yeltsin . But asked recently by two Russian journalists to name his heroes , Putin singled out men who had pulled their countries out of chaos and catastrophe  --  neither of them Yeltsin . One was Charles de Gaulle , who created a solid , centralized state in France ( and quickly pulled his country out of a colonial war in Algeria , a conflict that is often compared with that in Chechnya ) ; the other was Ludwig Erhard , architect of West Germany 's postwar economic revival . Putin sees obvious parallels with France of the 1950s and Germany of the late ' 40s . <P> Putin studiously avoids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearances that central power under Yeltsin was feeble . Some regional leaders , he claims , " forgot that there was a President . " Until he became Prime Minister , Chechnya was handled with " amateurism , " he says , and left to fester to the point that it became a deadly danger . <P> Putin is inheriting a sick country in every sense of the word . Its population declined by 900,000 last year , and male life expectancy , around 60 , stands at Third World levels . ( Female life expectancy is more than 10 years longer . ) Alcohol has killed millions ; now an AIDS epidemic seems set to take its toll on both genders . Russia is also beset by other systemic diseases , foremost among them corruption . Few of Russia 's 50 richest men could publicly explain how they moved from minor officials to billionaires in half a decade . Several have been investigated for crimes ranging from murder to embezzlement .                    @
