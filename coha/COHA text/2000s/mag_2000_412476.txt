How to find the right shade for your lamp // With lampshades , the line between sophisticated and silly is a fine one . Shape , style , and proportion can make the difference between a room with the elegance of Jackie Onassis and one where Oliver Hardy might feel more at home . According to lampshade designer Sue Johnson , selecting one is as personal as choosing a hat . " The choice of shade is an individual one . What might look good to me might not look good to someone else , " she says . But no matter what your style , some rules apply We outline the basics here . Establish the function of the lamp . Of the four types of lighting-decorative , accent , task , and ambient-decorative and task lighting are most commonly accomplished with table and floor lamps . Recessed cans or track lights that emphasize objects in a room are accent lights . Ambient light is the gentle indirect light bounced off ceilings and walls from such fixtures as cove lights or masked uplights . Decorative lamps and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space where they will sit . Task lighting calls for a shade broad enough to provide illumination to the entire work area . " The bottom of the shade should be at your shoulder height when you are seated , " Johnson says . " That way , it casts a bright light on your book but does n't throw glare in your eyes . " Photograph The elegant wide curve of this shade echoes the lines of the lamp 's base . // Reading lamps , a form of task lighting , demand large shades . " First , you will want a lot of directed light to come from the lamp . Second , you will want bright light , and that means a bigger shade . The higher the wattage , the bigger the shade needs to be , " Johnson says . Take into account how many people will be reading by the lamp 's light . Two people require a larger pool of light than one person . The broader the shade , the larger the light pool it creates . For detailed jobs , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The size of the shade also depends on the lamp 's placement . A lamp on a low table can wear a shorter shade than a lamp on a mantelpiece because you ca n't see underneath a shade below eye level . The same shade on a mantel , however , may not cover the bulb and harp ( the piece that curves around the bulb and holds the shade ) . The character of the room may have an influence as well : A small room with delicate furniture might suggest a small , delicate shade . Fit the shade to the size and shape of the lamp base . The basic purposes of a lampshade are to hide the hardware surrounding the bulb and to prevent glare . A shade needs to be large and low enough to accomplish those jobs . That general guideline , however , leaves you with a wide array of choices . Sue Johnson advises , " A good place to start is with the lamp 's shape . If you can pick up a detail of the base 's shape in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So if you have a lamp with a square base , try a square shade . A round or cylindrical base might look good with a round shade . Photograph Square and octagonal lampshades should match the geometry and proportion of their pedestals. // Finding the proper scale is also important ; try several shades to find the best one . Again , a good place to start is with the architecture of the base . A narrow base may look best with a smaller shade . A broader base could shine with a larger shade . Of course , exceptions abound . Photograph // If a shade you like seems either too long or too short , a few tricks can change where it falls on the base . You can swap the harp for a taller or shorter one , or you can add a raiser-a metal rod that screws on to the highest point of the harp-to raise the shade . Check hardware and lighting supply stores for these parts . Consider the wattage required and the heat that will be generated . " For reading , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shade that has a 4-inch opening at the top . If the wattage goes up , the opening should be bigger , " Johnson says . A paper or parchment shade also requires a generous opening at the top to release heat . " You can tell if the shade is n't big enough by turning on the lamp for five minutes and then feeling the shade . If it 's warm , that 's okay If it is hot , the top opening of the shade is n't big enough . " Shopping tips Sue Johnson and her associate J.B. Davis give the following advice to shade shoppers . If possible , bring your lamp base to the store . If you ca n't bring the base , bring its measurements and a piece of cloth or paper that matches its color . Look at the shade with the light on and with it off . " The nature of the shade will be very different . It 's important to see what it will look like during the day and at night .
