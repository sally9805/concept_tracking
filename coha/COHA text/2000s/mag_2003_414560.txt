Typically manufactured in only a couple huge sizes  --  as in 195 cm huge  --  they 're as hard to find in a shop as someone who actually knows how to hand file a ski . These are big , tough , fat , expensive boards that will carry you down any peak you can get an LZ on . TESTERS ' CHOICE SKIING mountain grown ! 1 ATOMIC BIG DADDY $875 If you 're strong enough , the Big Daddy 's long-radius sidecut has a surprisingly broad sweet spot : Even at slower speeds , our powerful testers could slide this ski in and out of tight places .

His ski  --  which cuts , carves , and holds on the faces of the biggest peaks  --  is no different . True , it has hints of sophistication : a balanced flex and a measured response to weighting and unweighting . But it also comes with a thin waist , which gave larger pros pause . GRIPES : Heavier skiers bemoaned the lack of flotation . PROPS : Single malt-smooth power and surprising forgiveness .

" It 's like a bull . Do n't get in its way , " says 120-pound pro Hilary Webb . The air carbon construction gives it a lightness that makes it maneuverable in tight spots , but it prefers to run wild in untracked powder and light chop . GRIPES : The lighter-weight chassis gets bounced around in heavier crud . PROPS : Perfect tool for no-boundary backcountry exploration . TESTER 'S TAKE : " Hit the weights and you 'll love this ski . "  --  Gordy Peifer Test Length ( cm ) : 180 Tip/Waist/Tail ( mm ) : 135/106/123 4 HEAD MONSTER I.M 103 PRO $800 If you dream of ripping chutes and big faces , the I.M 103 is your stick . Runner-up to the Atomic for speed and stability , its wide , stiff tail gave testers the confidence to lever high-speed super G turns on any snowpack . It 's not for the faint of heart , however . Be ready to go big . GRIPES : The 41-meter turn radius and beefy flex demand muscle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimal sidecut work in your favor on steep , tough pitches .

At 108 mm underfoot , it 's got enough float to paddle into Maverick 's , but you should n't pigeonhole it as a pow-only board . The torsion-box construction gives it a stable feel at any speed , and it has a soft , even flex that maximizes the turning capacity ( which may not be such a good thing for high-speed escapes ) . GRIPES : Voluptuous dimensions may give you more turns than you need . PROPS : Surf any mountain  --  just be ready for lots of cutbacks . TESTER 'S TAKE : " Super turner and great floater  --  love it .

The softer tip ( compared to , say , the Atomic ) makes it easy to steer and also gives it raftlike flotation in the fluff . GRIPES : It does n't have the top-end stability or float of the 105-mm-plus boards . PROPS : Strikes the perfect balance between reacting to power and finesse technique . TESTER 'S TAKE : " If it were any easier to turn , I could ski blindfolded.

A few years ago , skis this wide were known for their float , not their muscle , but Salomon has given their fat boards rebound and mad turning capabilties so they no longer hamstring aggressive skiers . Nearly every tester was impressed by how stable and strong the ski ran relative to how lightweight it felt . As for the retro split-tail , it 's not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length would suggest ( the 195 skied like a 185 ) . GRIPES : Does n't have that **31;1969;TOOLONG stability .

" Free associate at will : Vlkl 's feathery new wood core gives the Gotama a lightness of being that defies its 105-mm width . It 's nimble and quick , nailing the second-highest score in our maneuverability ranking . It 's also got grip to spare thanks to vertical Okume-wood sidewalls . GRIPES : It 's better suited to ski the mountain than to just plummet down it ; some of our hard-charging testers could overpower ol ' Gotama .
