What happens when a filmmaker with the gift of malice tries to make a love story ? Can his fine , scaly hand carry off a caress ? And if he can , will he connect with a film audience that long ago shrugged off amour ? <P> Neil LaBute 's rep , or rap sheet , is as a chronicler of cruelty . The two films he has written and directed ( In the Company of Men , Your Friends and Neighbors ) and his two best-known theater pieces ( Bash : Latterday Plays and The Shape of Things ) are cunning investigations into the way people hurt people . Now , in his version of A.S . Byatt 's Booker prizewinning novel , Possession : A Romance , he has ventured into Merchant-Ivory territory : that foreign country called the English past , where passion bursts from the corset of propriety and love is the most beautiful work two poets can create . <P> The poets are Randolph Henry Ash ( Jeremy Northam ) , a 19th century literary light with a famously serene marriage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renowned word magician . Imagine an affair between Robert Browning and Christina Rossetti and the scandal that would have rocked the 1860s  --  or the literary furor it might stoke today if the news were finally to come to light . That 's the notion that drives two modern scholars , the American Roland ( Aaron Eckhart ) and the British Maud ( Gwyneth Paltrow ) , deep into a long-submerged cache of love letters and finally into their own furtive embrace . <P> Falling in love with fiction is a favorite LaBute theme ; in Nurse Betty , which he directed but did n't write , the heroine convinces herself she is a soap-opera character . In Possession , the literary detectives Roland and Maud are stand-ins for any novel 's attentive reader . Turning the pages , we become involved in a vicarious espionage of the heart and then surrender to the spell of fantasy made real through a weaving of words . <P> The trick in a movie aiming at romantic refinement is to avoid being either pushy or inert . There Possession fails , certainly in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paltrow again imitates Englishness by sucking in her suave cheeks ; Eckhart ( a LaBute regular ) works too hard at being the outspoken American abroad . Gabriel Yared 's music is forced to do the actors ' emoting for them  --  a sure sign the director does n't trust the story to carry the feeling . <P> But he does place his confidence in Possession 's period scenes . For here the film goes persuasively old-fashioned , with a train-station declaration of love , a deathbed revelation and some dirty digging in a cemetery . And the actors are fully alive to the inherent romance . Northam , as in The Winslow Boy and Gosford Park , so easily embodies Randolph 's upper-class elegance that you might never know it had gone out of style . Ehle , the most beguiling of young Brit actresses , uses her tight smile to convey the pained radiance in Christabel 's wisdom . These actor-poets make love like chamber music  --  two cellos playing each other . " Did you not flame , " Christabel asks Ash , " and I catch fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the convulsive certitude of Victorian romance , it does indeed catch fire  --  and warms any viewer in the mood for love . <P>  --  By Richard Corliss
