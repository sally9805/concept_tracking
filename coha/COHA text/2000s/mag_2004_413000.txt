Ten years after the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman , O.J. Simpson plays golf , signs autographs and raises his kids . It all seems so normal-but it 's not // We , the jury , find O.J. Simpson ... no matter where he is . We find him at the supermarket , where we point and stare . On the highway , where we honk . And there , that 's us , whispering behind the 18th green . Some of us render the verdict that Simpson is a victim . " People wo n't let him live down the whole incident , " argues Pam Zambrano , assistant pro-shop manager at Miami 's Melreese golf course , where Simpson plays . " He 's very nice . " Others judge him in a far harsher light . " I 'd never golf with him . I wo n't even speak to him , " says Bill Roberson , a member of the Calusa Country Club , where O.J. also tees it up . " We all think he 's a murderer who got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be 10 years since Simpson 's wife , Nicole , and her friend Ron Goldman were killed outside Nicole 's Brentwood home , and the only court still in session-the court of public opinion-continues to pass judgment on Simpson each and every day . Acquitted at the trial of the century but found liable for the murders in a subsequent 1997 civil proceeding , Simpson exists in a kind of limbo-free to forge his future but unable to escape speculation about his past . It is an awkward , often painful predicament , yet one that Simpson and those around him grudgingly accept . " I 'm an easy target , " he told PEOPLE last year . " Hey , I can live with it-that 's life . " As for the $33.5 million in damages he was ordered to pay the families of Ron and Nicole , he simply has n't . He 's managed to shield his assets ( see box ) and provide his children Sydney , 18 , and Justin , 15 , with a comfortable , even affluent , lifestyle . This February an autograph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court ordered Simpson to give any profits to the victims ' families . " I would n't go out of my way to give them a dime , " Simpson said at the time . Ron Goldman 's father , Fred , still the most bitter of Simpson 's critics ( see box ) , says , " We 've never received one penny . " In 2000 Simpson fled his native California and moved to the Miami area , but here too his presence creates a perpetual media sideshow . " The weirdness of his celebrity is perfect for Miami , " says novelist Carl Hiaasen , a veteran chronicler of his state 's kooks and scoundrels . Sure enough , Simpson has had a hard time blending in : In 2001 he was charged with battery and auto burglary in a road-rage incident ( he was acquitted ) . There have also been at least four calls to police regarding domestic disputes between O.J. and sometime girlfriend Christie Prody . Now DirecTV is suing him for $20,000 for pirating satellite service ( Simpson claims he 's a paying customer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it appears , is as a father . His children-who are in his custody but spend several weeks a year with Nicole 's parents in California-are by many accounts happy and well-adjusted . Sydney is a senior at prestigious Gulliver Preparatory and was looking at colleges in Georgia and Colorado . " She has blossomed into a really beautiful kid , " says Nicole 's sister Denise , 46 , who runs the Nicole Brown Charitable Foundation , which helps abused women . Gulliver sophomore Justin excels in several sports and , like his sister , often has friends sleep over and spends hours instant-messaging pals . " I wonder if they 'll fall apart or be strong , " says Denise . " But I think they 'll go the strong route and shrug things off . " The Brown family , too , has had to shrug things off to keep an uneasy peace . Simpson never speaks with Nicole 's three sisters and instead discusses family matters with Nicole 's mother , Juditha , 73 . " My mom is very diplomatic ; she makes it work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who lectures against domestic violence . The Browns do n't talk about Simpson with the children , but they do share warm memories of Nicole-as much for themselves as for the kids . " I try to hear Nicole 's voice and sometimes I ca n't , " Tanya says . " I think it 's a defense mechanism that 's given to us . You learn to live your life without that person in it . " And in this way they go on-Simpson , his kids , his late wife 's family-grasping for some sort of normalcy . It is likely what they will face for the rest of their lives , or at least for as long as it takes Simpson to do what he has vowed-find Nicole 's killer . " I still have a couple of guys looking into things , " he told PEOPLE last year . " I have always thought my day would come . " Till then , his peers will have their say . This jury is never out . Sidebar O.J. plays a round in Pasadena March 12 . Justin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy and an old soul , " says Nicole 's sister Tanya . Sydney ( in ' ' 02 ) " does n't let you into her life right away . " Sidebar Show Us the Money With a $33.5 million judgment hanging over him , how come O.J. is n't broke ? Worth $11 million before the trial ( most of it went to lawyers ) , he now lives on at least $300,000 a year . His main income , $25,000 in monthly pensions from his NFL days , is exempt from creditors . Florida law also says his $575,000 ranch house with a pool in suburban Miami ca n't be seized to pay off debts . It also prevents creditors from garnishing the wages of any household head . Trying to Go On The most vocal of the next of kin , Fred Goldman still wears his broken heart on his sleeve " It galls me that he 's living and breathing , " Fred Goldman , 63 , says of O.J. Simpson , the man he believes murdered his son Ron ( left ) . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son . He 's the one who took Ron 's life . He 's the one who made it impossible for Ron to share in all our futures . " Ten years have done little to dull the pain for Goldman , who has learned how to deal with , if not diminish , his rage . " You never get past it ; without question it 's always there , " he says . " What you do is you find a way to live with it . You have no choice if you want to retain your sanity , your marriage and your family . " Six years ago Goldman and wife Patti left Los Angeles for a Phoenix suburb . Since then he has hosted a radio talk show and done special projects for the Arizona attorney general 's office of victim services ( he now works in clothing retail ) . He knows he ca n't do much to get Simpson to pay down the $33.5 million judgment against him . " If I could , I 'd slap him with orders every day , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as miserable as I could . But I ca n't spend every day chasing him around . " Last September Ron 's sister Kim Hahn , 32 , gave birth to her first child and named him Samuel Ronald . " Sammy is a joy , " says Goldman , who was in the delivery room . " But you know what ? It 's another reminder that Ron 's not here . He would have been there when Sammy was born .
