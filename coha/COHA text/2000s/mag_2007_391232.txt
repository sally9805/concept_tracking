The North American Downhill Series picks up speed . MY DISCOMFORT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT a 70-year-old man in spandex just slapped me on the ass . Or that my speed suit is two sizes too small . No , I 'm scared **30;3341;TOOLONG because I 'm queued up in the starting gate at the first annual Sugarbush Downhill , the first of three stops on the NADS ( North American Downhill Series ) citizen speed tour , and I am not a downhiller . " Do n't sweat it , " the aging racer says after removing his hand from my behind and adjusting himself in his mauve Louis Garneau squeezer . " At the bullwheel turn you 'll be pretty hot . Take that first gate way on the outside third . If you miss it ... well , you 'll be fine . You 'll figure it out . " I turn to plead for more advice . After all , he 'd trained on this course with Olympic downhiller Doug Lewis as part of Lewis 's Speed Camp , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But my number is up , literally , and the stranger in purple Lycra is swaggering back to his place in line . There 's no magic bullet in downhill anyway . Going fast is about balancing the elements  --  visibility , wax , fitness , luck , skill , age , whatever . Like a musician with a mixing board , you can blow out the treble so long as you 've got enough bass . Or balls . And just as mine are getting comfortable somewhere in my lower abdomen , there 's a hold on the course , allowing me a moment to reflect on the absurdity of it all : washed-up speed freaks  --  of whom I 'm not one  --  hurling themselves toward the bottom , where the mountain meets the real world , with its spouses , kids , jobs , and workaday responsibilities . Why are they here ? Why am I here ? As the starter calls my bib number , I realize that I 'm about to find out . NADS . OK , I get the pun . Three , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , skate . Pole , skate . Tuck . Still , why would a bunch of guys even older than me ( I 'm 33 ) be so interested in citizen racing that they 'd put years into coming up with sponsors and dealing with resort liability lawyers , for nothing more than the opportunity to chuck themselves at speeds in excess of 70 miles per hour ? For 46-year-old Aaron Henderson it 's about the brotherhood . " To do this , you 've got to have a certain type of personality , " he tells me after the race . " You meet these other guys and it 's almost like you 've known them all your life . " And then there 's the winning . Henderson will go on to become the first overall NADS champion  --  which is a pretty cool title . Like World Cup points , NADS points are awarded for the top 20 finishers at each race and compiled to crown an overall victor . After today 's event at Sugarbush , racers will travel to Crotched Mountain in New Hampshire , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two other stops  --  at New Hampshire 's Cannon and Ragged mountains  --  were canceled due to poor conditions . Though Jay 's George Syrovatka Downhill is 27 years old , before NADS came along in 2005 , there were few other opportunities for true speed freaks to get their rocks off save the odd United States Ski Association New England Masters super Gs each year . And the NADS events are open to anyone who can handle the course . Entry fees range from $45 to $80 . Hell , that 's less than a buck per mph . Last year 's Ragged event drew 60-some kids and at least as many adults  --  including nearly 20 women . Jay Peak typically sees 60 to 80 and as many as 100 racers . Times that by three ( five , if two races had n't been called ) and you 've got a little NADS movement . One that includes sharing hotel rooms with strangers , using ironing boards to wax skis , all-night drives , and a lot of post-race beer drinking . " There 's always been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Here I am , a former World Cupper , and I 'm getting totally amped being around these guys all week . They make these breakthroughs and what I told them actually works . It 's cool . " Hip , hip . OK . Set that right edge . Hold . Be patient . Wait . Unweight . Press . Press . Left . Set that left edge . Hip , hip . Come on , you 're getting late . Scrub it . Get back on line . Elbows down . " I guess I 'm one of those people who can click into the mode , " says Henderson , a commercial fisherman and building contractor from Kittery Point , Maine . Henderson may ski little more than a dozen days per year , but he 's got a builder 's leather hands and looks gymnast-fit , something he attributes to riding motocross with his kids in the summer . " Sometimes you do n't realize that when you put yourself in the starting gate , for the next minute you 're really putting yourself on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurling themselves down these courses . But there are a lot more gates in GS and slalom . In DH you 're dealing with speed , g-forces , and maybe some air , but you do n't have to worry about hooking a tip . " Let them run . Red . Let them run . Blue . OK , so I 'm in the middle of the course and I 'm starting to see a trend here and it 's not just left and right , blue and red . Let them run . Let " em go . Breathe . This is all a mind thing . I mean , you can always throw them sideways . Or ski away if the fear gets too severe . Maybe the older you get the better you can deal with the psychology of speed . Most of these guys here are at least 30 . Is that when you get the mix right ? Like the dreamers who came up with the NADS concept , Kit Dover , 56 , of Sanbornton , New Hampshire , has a penchant for speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bush , he 's not a racer of pedigree . His rsum includes high school racing , beer leagues at places like Shawnee Peak and Sunapee , and NASTAR . " To me , it 's more than just racing . It 's a spiritual act , " he says . " I do n't go to church but I guess I 'm a religious guy . " He corrects himself : " More spiritual than religious . You 'd have to be crazy if you were n't afraid . And I look at these guys . They 're all responsible people with jobs , so we ca n't be crazy . " Finish line . I 'm alive . Stand up . Stop . As I wait for the results at the base of the Sunny Side lift it 's clear that Henderson has an agenda : He 's 17 hundredths of a second in front , and the only guy who 's got a shot now is the old man I met before my start . Here he comes , careening through the finish line , a blur of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaching for the sky he struggles to stop . His time does n't touch Henderson 's , but when the announcer prattles the result over the loudspeaker he delivers my second spanking of the day . Now , can anyone help me out of this suit ?
