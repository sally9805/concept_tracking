Sheila Finch has written about a dozen stories concerning the Lingsters , including a passel of short stories and the novels Triad and Reading the Bones . She has recently assembled the Lingster short stories into one volume which is due to be published soon under the title The Guild of Xenolinguists . In the process of assembling the book , she was inspired to go back to the beginning and write the story about bow it all started - and she was pleased to find out that it did n't quite originate in the way she 'd always thought . We think you 'll also be pleased to see how the guild originated . <p> JAMAL LENANA PAUSED , his breath rasping . The ascent was harder than he 'd expected . The antigrav lift-belt he 'd let the cute shop assistant talk him into purchasing in Moshi at the foot of Kilimanjaro seemed to be an expensive fake ; he was doing most of the work instead of the other way around . When you gon na learn , brol he thought . Always a sucker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweltering temperatures of September , with or without a working lift-belt . A month ago , he 'd been finishing up his Ph.D . in Linguistics at UC Berkeley . At the last minute , the committee had balked at his ideas about the emergence of language , something so fundamentally driven by biology he 'd made the outrageous suggestion it might even control the development of alien languages - if humans ever had the luck to meet any . So he 'd walked out , leaving his dissertation and his career on the seminar table , and gone to Africa . Mopping his brow , he turned his attention back to Kilimanjaro 's snow-covered peak . At least another couple of hours to the top , but unless the antigrav belt worked as advertised , he was n't going to make it . He 'd come up a long way from the scrub plateau of the plains , through the lower , cultivated slopes and the cloud forest , and had reached a more open section of grassy moor , yet he seemed to be only halfway . The incense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose up to his sensitive nose . This might be Mother Africa , he thought , but there was too much American in his African blood for him to be comfortable with the fierce sun so near the equator . Getting to the caldera at the top of Kilimanjaro was rapidly losing its charm . His gaze was caught by a dark bird circling on a thermal . Vulture , maybe , scanning for fresh kill . It flew toward him , following the path up the mountain . It grew bigger , and he could see it was a helicopter , not a bird . The craft , painted a dull , unreflective black , made an almost silent approach . It bore no markings or identification of any kind . Now he could see the pilot and another man beside him-and if he had n't known better , he 'd have thought the chopper 's occupants were looking for him . " Dr. Lenana ? " the craft 's PA boomed . The chopper settled to the ground a few feet away . The blades slowed , stopped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no identifying patches slid down from the open hatch and gazed at him . " You are Dr. Jamal Lenana ? " " Who wants to know ? " " Come with us , please . " He shook his head . " You 're looking for someone else , bro . " The man , with a bony face and tight mouth that looked as if it did n't waste much energy smiling , adjusted dark glasses . " We were sent to find you specifically , Dr. Lenana . " Damn RFIDs and GPS and the rest of the surveillance alphabet , he thought . Too easy to find anybody anywhere these days . It had to be bad news about his father . The old man would be almost ninety by now , and they had n't spoken in years . Lenana Senior had retired from the army as a two-star general and gone to work for the NSA . He had connections with the defense and intelligence gathering communities ; he must 've asked old friends to find his son . " Please . We 're wasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go with their request . But it was hot , his muscles were complaining , he was tired of trail mix and hungry for real food , and he could always experience Kilimanjaro in VR . It had been a whim anyway , born in a fit of anger when he realized what he 'd done to his career . The pilot leaned out the door and extended his hand . Jamal took it and climbed in . The pilot indicated a seat , then adjusted the safety harness . There were no identifying patches or insignia on his flight suit either . The first man climbed in behind him . " Going to tell me what this is all about ? " " Your dissertation 's on the universal biological roots of language , is n't it , Dr. Lenana ? " " It 's not " Doctor " Lenana . This some kind of joke or what ? " Since when did esoteric linguistics become important to guys who spent their time in unmarked uniforms and stealth craft ? " No joke , sir . " The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then thought better of it . " I understand your work is potentially valuable , given the times we live in . " " I 'm a theoretical linguist . There are plenty of talented translators coming out of the Defense Language Institute in Monterey . Enough to deal with any language or dialect around the world . " Especially terrorist ones , he thought , the hot topic when he 'd started graduate school . The old man had argued - unsuccessfully - if his youngest child and only son was going to move to the West Coast , he should go to DLL " Suppose we 're dealing with a language that we 've not encountered before ? Hypothetically , of course , " the man added . Absurd . There were no more undiscovered languages hiding in unexplored jungles on the planet . Come to that , there were hardly any more jungles . " Not interested . " " I 'm sorry , sir , " the man said . " I ca n't tell you any more than that . You 'll be briefed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to admit , Jamal , we have n't seen anything quite like this before . " The man whose sixth-floor office in Maryland he 'd been ushered into was someone he 'd known in his childhood . Tom Wang had often been a guest in the Lenana home in the Baltimore suburbs , one of the crowd of young NSA agents with hazy backgrounds and obscure career descriptions that Miriam Lenana took pleasure in feeding . He remembered Tom Wang in particular , seated on a straight-backed chair under the portrait of Jamal 's great-grandfather as a Tuskegee Airman , always laughing at some lame joke Jamal 's father made . Even as a boy , he 'd recognized a kiss-up when he saw one . Older now , heavier , black hair fading to silver , Wang had gained deep furrows in his brow . Unlike Jamal 's escorts , he wore an exquisite suit , a pale blue shirt , and a slightly darker tie . He perched informally on the edge of a walnut desk as if to set his visitor at ease . Jamal was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and informality - sprawling plants in corners , framed prints of sailboats on the wall - that seemed designed to cover a more ominous purpose . Behind Wang , a long window gave a view of the vast parking lot of the NSA compound . The windows were sealed , the pinewoods scent in the room coming from an air freshener his nose identified though his eyes could n't find it . Jamal was tired from the journey and short on patience right now . He 'd never had much liking for either intelligence gathering or what the military had become since his great-grandfather 's day . " Mind telling me why the NSA thinks I 'd be interested in working for them ? " " Please , sit down . " Wang indicated two armchairs on either side of a faux fireplace . " I 'll have someone bring us coffee and then we 'll talk . " When the coffee arrived , a young intern set the tray on a low table . Jamal made eye contact with her and she smiled . Coppery hair in a short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . Sweet deal to have eye candy like that on your staff , he thought , watching her pour the coffee . From the deliberate way she bent over , letting her white silk blouse drape away from tanned cleavage , he knew she was aware of his attention , enjoying it . Wang waited until she left the room . " We have here a puzzle , " Wang began . " Three days ago , a couple of Maryland State Troopers picked up a vagrant , a man they 'd found stark naked on Highway 95 just outside DC . He did n't respond to English . As the law orders , they called in interpreters . They expected he 'd speak a European language , German , or perhaps Russian or something Scandinavian - logical , considering his blond features . When that did n't work , they put out a call for speakers of languages with smaller speaker pools like Basque and Amharic . They got the same lack of result every time . " " They tried sign ? " Wang nodded . " Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitated as if he were weighing how much information to share . " Probably not in this case . " Jamal shook his head . " Country 's full of homeless people - hah7 of them totally nuts . Maybe the troopers just found another one . " Wang had the grace to look uncomfortable , Jamal thought , confirming that he was withholding information . " The secretary wants an answer ASAP , " Wang said . " There 're still a few languages left in the world with only a handful of speakers . It 's possible to find something nobody in Maryland speaks , surely ? " " If that were all . " " The DLI ought to be up to the job of figuring out the language of a vagrant . Why not pull them in ? " And I 'm outta here , he thought . Last thing he wanted was to get involved with the NSA . And secretaries giving orders - what was that all about ? " I do n't get why the cops ca n't solve their own problems . Overkill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Maybe not in this case , " Wang said . " I 'd like to hear what you think . " " My dissertation 's on how languages evolve , not how to speak any of them . " Wang nodded . " I 've followed your career ever since those early days when your mother used to feed the starving junior agents . Brilliant piece of speculation , I 'm told . Something about " universal bionecessities " - I think that was your term ? - driving language evolution . " " That 's all it was , speculation . " Wang set his coffee aside and stood up . " Let 's take a look downstairs before we decide . " Wang held up a palm to an armed guard who scanned it briefly , then opened the heavy door into an interrogation room . Jamal saw a long metal table holding a plastic water jug and a wrapped supply of plastic glasses , two chairs positioned on one side of the table , one on the other , and a large mirror . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room that struck him as more artificial than the air freshener in Wang 's office . A young man who 'd been in the room nodded at them and left . His first view of the stranger took his breath away . My God ! It 's Michelangelo 's David ! The man who stood staring into the mirror - which Jamal belatedly realized was probably one-way-was probably seven feet tall , and dressed in a T-shirt and sweat pants too short for his long legs . His feet were bare . His body was well muscled , but like a dancer , not a weightlif ter , his skin golden ; his hair was white-gold and almost luminous . The guy was stunning . Prenatal genetic tinkering was advanced these days , but Jamal doubted it could produce results like this . " Our doctors did a preliminary , non-invasive examination when he arrived here yesterday , " Wang said . " X-ray and MRI revealed no injuries that might account for the unresponsiveness . There were some anomalies , slight , but rather puzzling . There 's something-let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scored high on nonverbal intelligence tests but he does n't - or wo n't - speak . " The stranger was the most fantastic specimen of male humanity he 'd ever seen . If he was human . Jamal thought suddenly of rumors he 'd heard about secret medical labs on the East Coast producing experimental chimeras and hybrids , weapons for the ongoing defense effort . He 'd never taken the rumors seriously . Then the stranger turned and looked at him . His eyes were a pale , almost silver gray ; it was hard to meet their gaze , but Jamal forced himself to do so . Some intelligence leaped the gap between them like a jolt of electricity , and he took an involuntary half-step back . " How long have you had him ? " " At Fort Meade ? Almost twenty-four hours . " Abruptly aware of the one-way mirror and the potential presence of observers , he demanded , " Is he a prisoner ? " " No , no . He 's in custody for his own protection , until we know more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect individual whose gaze never wavered . Something about him-Jamal felt a shiver of excitement run down his spine . Instinctively , he reverted to Homo sapiens " oldest language , gesture . In the harsh light of the interrogation room , he held his right hand up above shoulder level , fingers splayed , palm facing the stranger , sending the nonverbal message : Hail . No threat . No response . Yet he had the impression his gesture had been understood , but the stranger had not felt a need to respond - Or as if Jamal should 've known he was n't a threat without being told - Or at least , he could be a threat but did n't choose to His mind reeled with complexities he could n't have explained to Wang and was n't about to try . Already he was aware of some kind of subliminal bond forming between himself and the stranger : Us and the NSA . He fought it . " You 've got yourself a problem . But I do n't see how it involves me . " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biological construct of some kind . " Wang hesitated , again seeming to weigh how much information to share with Jamal . " Not one of ours . We want to know who sent him to us . " Jamal absorbed that information for a moment . So the rumors were true - and not only the United States was doing it . Something about the idea of creating life in the human image did n't sit right with him ; too many Sunday mornings fidgeting beside his mother in a stiflingly hot Baptist church had left their mark . " I told you , I 'm a theorist . I do n't do f ieldwork . And I sure as hell do n't work for the intelligence community or the military . " " I 'm not asking you to . But you come from a military family . And we need a linguist with an open mind , someone who 's creative , not afraid to speculate . " It went against his principles , but at the same time there was no way he could pass up an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very least he might get a paper out of it for one of the professional journals , damage control for his self-sabotaged career . " There 's one more thing you should know , " Wang said . " When the troopers found him on the highway , he suddenly appeared . One moment the road was empty . The next , he was there . " He reluctantly dragged his attention away from the stranger and stared at Wang . " We have no technology to do that , " Wang added . " We did n't think anyone else did either . " AT TEN MINUTES to six the next morning , Jamal sat at a desk with an untouched pastry and a cooling cup of coffee in front of him , thinking about the problem he 'd been handed . He 'd slept fitfully last night , although Wang had instructed the cute intern to find him a comfortable room and arrange for his meals . If the U.S.A. - and everybody else , including its enemies , according to Wang-was incapable of creating a bioconstruct that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at ? Wang had dodged the question when he 'd asked after they left the interrogation room . Whatever the explanation for the stranger 's origins , the problem remained how to plan a series of language lessons . Nothing in his course work at Berkeley had prepared him for this . You dropped yourself right into this one , bro , he told himself . The dissertation that so defiantly claimed to know a way to decipher the basics of just about any language that turned up in the galaxy was going to be put to the test . Pulling out the small keyboard he found in the desk drawer , he typed in his code . Immediately , a flat screen rose out of the desk , displaying the home page of his personal desk computer back in Berkeley . He accessed the dissertation and scrolled rapidly through , looking for anything that might be useful , pulling it out and sending it to the nearby printer . Well , he amended half an hour later , he had n't actually promised to be able to do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't been impressed . This morning , staring at his words on the screen , he was n't impressed either . Where did that leave him ? There were no undiscovered tribes with unknown languages left on Earth , so no call for people doing original fieldwork anymore . The last linguist who 'd done that died almost a century ago . And he was too impatient to enjoy spending hours making recordings of ancient native speakers , last of their tribe or whatever . That was why he 'd gone into theoretical linguistics . But he knew how it was done in the old days ; he 'd taken the first step yesterday with his gesture of greeting . A knock on the door disturbed him . Wang 's red-haired intern put her head around the door . A faint whiff of a floral perfume with darker notes entered with her . " Did you need anything , sir ? It 's my job to take care of you . " He sized her up . She was young , early twenties he guessed , with a fresh-faced innocence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that lent more than one meaning to her words . He guessed she was one of those groupies hooked on the aura of power that surrounded the important men she worked for . How far would that power addiction go , he wondered ? He had the impression she would n't turn him down if he put the moves on her . But for the moment he was preoccupied with the stranger . " Maybe later . " " I 'll keep it in mind , " she said , winking at him . " By the way , my name 's Corinne . " When she 'd gone , he looked back at the notes he 'd printed out . Useless . He crumpled them up and tossed them into the recycling chute under the desk . This was a situation that called for playing from his strength , what his thesis committee had dismissively called intuition . Nothing wrong with intuition , but he preferred the stronger image of flying by the seat of his pants , like his great-grandfather . He opened the door . The man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he seemed as if he 'd be more at home in a priest 's collar than the impeccably tailored gray suit and tie he was wearing . " ' Morning , sir . " The man saluted him with precision that spoke of a military background . Light in the hallway struck a small reflection from the tiny comm unit he wore on his lapel . " Guarding me against the enemy ? " The man smiled . " I 'm here to assist you , sir , and to guide you through the maze of corridors in this building in case you do n't remember the way . Whoever the architect was , he had a sense of humor . The name 's Glenys , Aldo Glenys . " " Interesting combination . " " My father was Welsh , but I grew up in Switzerland with my mother 's family . " They shook hands . Aldo Glenys was maybe ten years older than he was . Jamal sensed something cool and focused in the man . Not your ordinary career soldier or intelligence agent , he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seminaries these days . " You said , " assist . " Are you a linguist ? " " Only in the amateur sense of the word , sir . Language has long been a hobby of mine . I taught myself to speak several . " " And Latin 's one ? " He caught a flicker of surprise in Glenys 's eyes and added , " Just a guess . " " A good one , " Glenys agreed . Score one for me , he thought and let it go , - he had other things to think about . " The interrogation room is equipped for both video and audio recording , fully automated . You wo n't see the equipment , but it 's there , " Glenys told him . " We 'll be analyzing every word you can coax out of him . " " That important , huh ? " Glenys glanced at him , his expression neutral . They made their way through corridors of closed , unmarked doors , past uniformed receptionists who recognized Glenys and waved them through , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd visited last night . Another armed guard stood on duty . " Necessary security , sir , " Glenys said . " We do n't know what we 're dealing with yet . " " And when we do ? " Glenys presented his palm to the sensor pad and did n't answer . When they entered , they found the tall stranger with his back to the one-way mirror which at the moment had morphed itself into a glowing portrait of a tranquil river meadow with lots of trees . Maybe the stranger knew there was someone behind the glass and that was why he 'd turned his back . Jamal wondered uneasily if those odd silver eyes could see through the one-way glass . Today the visitor 's gray shin and sweat pants outfit was almost the right size ; it looked as if it had been borrowed from someone in the NBA . His feet were still bare . There were two other men in the room , one blond , one - slightly older - dark-haired , both wearing dark suits ; they had arranged folding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief nods but did n't identify themselves . The stranger obviously was n't a normal human , so he had to be a bioconstruct - even if Jamal personally found it hard to believe any lab was capable of creating one , and no matter how he arrived on the highway in front of the troopers . " Did this guy spend the night in here ? " he asked . The two NSA agents did n't move a facial muscle . " He has a room normally occupied by a junior grade agent , " Glenys said . " Do you see a problem ? " Jamal shook his head . " Forget it . " The agents were an annoyance . He did n't feel comfortable enough with his assignment to want witnesses . " I 'll ask you gentlemen to keep your thoughts to yourselves while I work , " he told them . " I do this my way or not at all . " One of the agents-the blond one-nodded . The other staredpast Jamal . How was he going to start the session ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an intelligent organism to control its environment through the assignment of symbols to objects , and to manipulate the symbols according to a set of strict rules governing the play of objects , causes , and goals . Physiology and environment affected world view . Whatever they were dealing with here , the stranger resembled normal humans closely enough : bipedal , opposable thumbs , air breather ; he might come equipped with similar rules for language . The stranger turned his face toward Jamal . There was an aura about him that inspired awe . Get the guy to Hollywood , Jamal thought , and there 'd be a fortune to be made in VR . Maybe that 's what they had in mind , whoever constructed him . Time to get started . He indicated the table and patted the back of one of the chairs , then pantomimed sitting in it . He took the other chair and repeated the patting gesture . Aldo Glenys leaned against a wall , arms folded , watchful . The stranger came over to the table . " Sit down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign of nonthreat among humans and primates and even some dogs - lips curving upward exposing teeth but not aggressively , skin at the corner of the eyes wrinkling . He hoped it truly was universal . If not , he might be very glad there were other people in the room with him . The visitor sat down but did not return the smile . He 'd have to find something to call him besides " stranger " and " visitor , " if only to keep his own thoughts straight . " Man " was obviously not right . Long before they reached the stage of deep structure his dissertation had speculated about , they would have to rely on some pretty basic fieldwork stuff : Ostension , the oldest trick in the linguist 's book . He tapped his own breast with his right index finger . " Jamal . " Would one of those old-time fieldworkers have said " man " first , not his own name ? He doubted it ; that would have necessitated a distinction between man and non-man that even conversing with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required . The visitor gazed unblinking at him . " Jamal . " He repeated the breast-tapping gesture . " Jamal . " " Jamal , " the visitor said clearly . Off to a good start , he thought . He reinforced the first lesson by repeating , " Jamal . " " Jamal , " the visitor repeated . His hand rose to take the second step , pointing at the visitor to elicit bis name , then he paused . What if pointing waa an insult - or worse in the visitor 's experience ? His own grandmother , the Tuskegee pilot 's daughter , had considered it rude to point . He saw now that far from being boring , fieldwork might well have been downright dangerous . It only succeeded because humans mostly forgave cultural faux pas in the beginning of a language exchange in return for understanding . There was a hunger for language in humans , but he could n't assume that would be true here . If he did n't take the risk they 'd get nowhere . Careful to keep his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed at the other 's breast , and waited . Nothing . Back to step one . Turning the finger toward himself , he said , " Jamal . " " Jamal , " the visitor agreed . But no sound came from his lips when the finger was reversed . Leaning back in his chair , Jamal thought about this for a moment . He was aware of Clenys quietly filling plastic tumblers from the plastic water jug . The two agents were busy keying notes into small e-pads . At least they were obeying his rules . He needed the visitor to grasp the idea that he was supposed to furnish his own word for whatever Jamal pointed at , beginning with the one that signified personal identity . Maybe he could bypass the problem by shelving it for the moment . Language acquisition began with the naming of objects as well as self , the arbitrary signs that paired sound with image . Might as well work on vocabulary . He put his finger on the table top . " Table . " " Table , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He thought of his own stumbling attempts to master a few phrases in Swahili before his trip to Africa , and the amusement he 'd caused the cute girl in the shop where he 'd bought the defective antigrav belt . " Chair , " he said . The visitor repeated the word . Then : mirror , floor , ceiling , wall , door , eye , hand , cup , water . All were successfully mastered . After an intense hour of this , he tried pointing to the objects and waiting . The visitor passed this test too , correctly naming each object indicated . So he was intelligent as well as beautiful , learning vocabulary faster than a normal human , baby or adult . Nor did he register any sign of strain from the exercise . But when Jamal tried to elicit the visitor 's own word for an object he was met with silence . Either he had no preexisting language - like Frankenstein 's monster he was a tabula rasa - or he chose not to share his language with his teacher . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-way communication , did it indicate something sinister ? Elbows on the table , his chin leaning on his hands , Jamal gazed at the visitor . The visitor stared back . Waiting for the lesson to continue or playing some kind of game ? He was frustrated by not being able to pin it down . They could go on like this all day , creating a vocabulary of English words for everything in this room - all week , if they ventured outside . He decided to leap ahead . Human infants learned around thirteen thousand words before they entered school , but they learned something more useful too , the rules governing how to combine and recombine the words , a generative grammar that underpinned communication . It would take numerous repetitions , but ultimately the visitor must grasp the rule of names and actions if they were to move forward , and the distinctive subject-verb-object order that English used to portray them . " Jamal , " he said once more , pointing to himself . Then he stood up . He was aware of the sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they think he was going to do - attack ? " Stand , " he said , identifying his action . He sat down again and repeated the rising action . " Stand . Jamal stand . " The inflected , third person singular ending , dinosaur that it was , could wait for another lesson . He figured it would slip out of the language one of these days anyway . " Stand , " the visitor said and got to his feet . They followed this up with " Jamal " performing a variety of actions , sitting again , waving , clapping , drinking , all immediately understood and repeated by the visitor . Then he branched out , first reviewing the names of objects : Jamal , eye - then an action : close - finally putting one together with another for the combination of actor , action , and acted upon that was basic to English word order . " Jamal close eye , " he said , winking . The visitor gazed at him for a moment till Jamal thought he 'd moved too quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to something a bit simpler . Then the visitor suddenly leaned over and seized Jamal 's right hand in his own - the first time their flesh had made contact - bending the fingers down tight against the palm until they hurt . " Jamal close hand , " the visitor said . He experienced a cold rush of fear . And something else , a blinding sense of knowing . There was a blur of action ; both agents shot to their feet . Glenys took a step forward . The visitor released Jamal 's hand and Jamal waved them away , his heart racing . Given the size of the visitor and his unknown powers , every bone in his hand might have been crushed . But more than that was the realization he knew what he was dealing with . Whatever he was , the visitor had recognized he 'd been given a pattern and had adapted it correctly on the first try . That was n't supposed to happen . It was n't possible he could 've learned so fast - yet he just had . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more metaphorical level . " Jamal close hand " signaled the end of the need for ostension . This was more than a man-made bioconstruct . He could n't prove it , but he was convinced he was dealing with something not from Earth . An alien . Glenys coughed discreetly . " Everything all right so far , sir ? " " I think we 're done for the morning , " he said shakily . Glenys nodded and opened the door . The two agents had returned to their folding chairs . " This is one hell of a situation , " he began as they went outside . Glenys cocked his head warningly in the direction of the waiting guard . His nerves still buzzed with the adrenaline jolt he 'd received with that contact . It was freaking unbelievable , but how else to explain what he 'd just experienced ? It could n't be explained - that was the point . But he knew ! They were dealing with an extraterrestrial . Wang would think he was crazy if he reported that ! So what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work for them . He did n't care what they thought . This was his opportunity . The professional journals would go nuts over the paper that was going to result from this experience . He considered the implications of what had happened . As he understood it , a linguist discovered the subject 's words and translated them into the language of the major culture , opening up the native 's limited experience to the scrutiny of a wider world . The linguist had the skill and the knowledge to achieve that ; the subject did n't . Later , the subject might learn the dominant language , but that was not the primary purpose of the enterprise . But this visitor had just turned the situation on its head - he was learning Jamal 's language , not the other way around , a profound difference . How was he going to deal with an intelligence that obviously far exceeded his own ? " I think you might need a cup of coffee , sir , " Glenys said as they retraced their path through the maze of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee . And stop calling me " sir " like some freaking Knight of the Round Table ! " Glenys smiled . " I heard you did n't appreciate being called " Dr. Lenana " either . I have a car outside . Maybe you 'd like to get away from the compound for lunch ? " " Damn straight ! " He was still jittery with the magnitude of what had just happened and what it implied . They retrieved Glenys 's cream-colored Mercedes Helio and headed for the gate to the compound . Guards raised the barrier and waved them through . The Maryland countryside , turning gold with the approach of autumn , slid silently by . Neither of them spoke . Glenys finally pulled into the crowded parking lot of a small roadhouse whose sign advertised softshell crabs and cocktails . " Civilians , " Glenys noted . " They have the leisure time to take late lunches . " The interior was dim , wood-paneled , with appetizing , homey smells from an unseen barbecue pit . In the booth , Jamal ordered a steak sandwich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the crab . They both ordered beer . " Farm raised these days , " Glenys commented when the server arrived with his plate of crabs . " But reasonable . " Like the beer glasses , the plates were the new plastic type ; he 'd been so monastic on the Berkeley campus he had n't kept up with the latest inventions . Better eat fast , bio , he thought , or they 'd disintegrate from under his sandwich . The steak might as well have been hamburger ; he did n't pay attention to the taste . If he was right , the visitor was an alien . The alien 's language ability was vastly superior to that of humans - and language was what humans did best . What might that imply for the future of human/alien relations ? And he 'd been the first person to make contact - if that 's what had actually happened between them this morning . " Interesting session , " Glenys said when Jamal 's silence stretched to minutes , an obvious invitation to speculate . " What if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glenys ? " Glenys gazed at him . " Tom Wang is under a lot of pressure to discover who sent him to us as fast as possible . " " And if he is n't a bioconstruct ? " " There 's an old saying among SETI warriors : If we meet the alien on his world , then we have the edge , " Glenys observed . " But if the alien comes to us , then he 's superior . " The man 's words penetrated his speeding thoughts . " You do n't accept Wang 's idea it 's some enemy plot . You think he 's an alien too . " " I like to keep an open mind . " Jamal absorbed this . This morning he 'd been ready to feel morally superior to those who built human analogs . Now he was standing on the brink of something far more astounding - there really were aliens out there and he was supposed to communicate with one of them . " How superior must you be to come alone into hostile territory ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What if I discover he 's the scout for an invading horde from outer space ? " " In that case , " Glenys said . " I guess Wang will order him eliminated . " And you 're the guy elected to do it , are n't you ? Jamal guessed . Glenys ordered drink refills from the inset pad . After the server had set down the full glasses , retrieved the empties , and left again , he said , " We 'll get a map of the sky . see if he 'll identify home - if he 's an alien . " " He 's just too goddamned perfect to be human or anything humans could come up with . But he never reacts to anything . What 's with that ? Couple of times , I felt like leaning over and punching him , see if that got a reaction . " " Probably not a great idea , " Glenys said lightly . " I 'm a theoretical linguist , Glenys . Way out of my depth . " " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its depth from now on . " " Christ ! " he said , swirling the lime wedge in his drink . Then he glanced up at his companion . " Sorry . Correct me if I 'm wrong , but I have a feeling - " " Do n't apologize . I started out in Geneva at a seminary , but I learned I was too worldly even for the Jesuits . " " Quite a jump to the NSA . " Glenys laughed . " Maybe not as far as you think . " The alcohol slid pleasantly through his body , relaxing his tense nerves . " Wang seems to be losing it . Told me his secretary wanted the answers . " " That 's the secretary of Defense , " Glenys said . On edge again , he stood up abruptly . " We need to get back . " The two agents were still in the room when they got back . One hastily picked up the remains of what looked like a fast food meal , sweeping plates and cups from the interview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed out the door to the guard . Jamal wondered what the alien had eaten for lunch . He had to have eaten something ; everything living had to find nourishment . Maybe the agents shared their cheeseburgers with him . With or without pickles ? For a second he felt hysterical laughter bubbling up and forced it back down . Anytime he allowed the thought to arise that he was dealing with a real extraterrestrial , he almost lost it . He needed to stay calm , in control of the situation . The afternoon session proved to be no less astonishing than the morning one , and just as frustrating . The alien 's ability to learn English was swift and accurate . Rarely did Jamal have to repeat a structure before the alien had it and made it his own . He had no doubt the alien understood everything he communicated to him . Yet all attempts to elicit words in the alien 's own tongue were ignored . He felt the tug of competing emotions , awe , and a growing irritation . And cold fear when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seized his hand . " Jamal stands and sees mirror , " the alien said as Jamal demonstrated , proving his rapidly developing mastery of generative grammar . The visitor had picked up the third person singular inflection from the brief bursts of human conversation around him . Unbelievable if Jamal had n't experienced it for himself . Jamal judged it was time for a few pointers about determiners and prepositions . " Jamal sees the mirror on the wall . " The alien gazed at him without a flicker of expression . " The water fills the cup on the table . " In rapid fashion , Jamal demonstrated the usefulness of in , out , up , down , with and every other preposition he could think of , plus the negatives but , not , nor . The alien mastered all of them easily and used them in new sentences . Then came pronouns , / and you . The alien pointed a finger at Jamal and said , " You . " But he made no move to use a pronoun for himself . Maybe they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But before he could start , the door of the interrogation room opened and the guard looked in . He spoke quietly to Glenys who nodded . The door shut again . Stepping to the one-way mirror , Glenys touched the glass . The river meadow transformed itself quickly into a stargazer 's map of the night sky . Damn , Jamal thought , I guess we 're taking this " alien " bit for real ! The bizarre situation caught him by the throat every so often . You 're talking to E. T. , bro ! One thing about the strange being opposite him was the almost total lack of what psychologists called " affect . " He displayed no emotional reaction to anything that happened around him , not pleasure nor excitement , and not even boredom when the lessons were repetitive , just an unwavering focus . Jamal found this cold intensity unnerving . But when he saw the map , the tall alien stood up and made a circling motion over the screen with his index finger . " What do you think he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle ? No , a spiral . Spiral galaxy ? Maybe he 's saying the Milky Way is his home galaxy too . But where in the galaxy ? " " With his language skills he ought to be able to tell us straight out . " One of the agents bent his head to his collar and murmured into his comm unit . The alien turned away from the map on the screen . Whatever he 'd intended to communicate , Jamal thought , he was done with it , and if humans were too dense to figure it out , that was their problem . Suddenly angered , he pushed his chair back and stood up . " I 'm done for the day . We 're getting nowhere . " " I 'll have him supplied with recorded samples of conversational English this evening , " Glenys said as they left the room . " He would n't be the first person to master a foreign language by watching sitcoms . " " He 's playing games with us . " " I suspect his mission is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Glenys said . After dinner with Tom Wang in the executive dining room - with real china for the prime rib and real crystal for the California Cabernet he excused himself early , and made his way a little unsteadily back to his room . Wang had n't eaten much , more interested in Jamal 's report , what there was of it . Wang 's questions had been probing . He 'd seemed to accept the news the stranger was probably an alien , not a construct , better than Jamal had expected , and he wondered about that . Humoring me because of dear old dad and my " ' military family " ? Wang probably figured Jamal would achieve the objective of decoding the stranger 's language even if his judgment was seriously impaired . Either way , Wang must be disappointed with the lack of progress he 'd made today . Extraterrestrial or enemy construct who was rapidly learning English was n't exactly what the NSA or the government would be hoping for . Location , intention , and capability were more like it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near future somewhere between highly unlikely and not at all . He remembered a time in his childhood when the search for extraterrestrial intelligence had been a hot topic , but decades of no results had taken their toll ; people had given up expecting E.T . to arrive or even signal his existence - or even the son of E.T. , lord what a terrible sequel that was ! And if this really was an alien they were dealing with , where was the mother ship ? If there was one , NASA 's Near Earth Asteroid Tracking facilities at Maui or Palomar would surely have found it . A society that put space hotels and telescopes and solar mirrors into orbit ought to be able to manage that much . It scared him to think the future of humanity might be balanced on so small a thing as the first words an alien learned from an unprepared teacher . He was embarrassed to think his dissertation had even hinted the process might be easy . And what impression were they making on an obviously superior alien visitor by keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrogation room - and who knew what else he personally was n't aware of ? Whatever happened here at Fort Meade , there were going to be repercussions down the line . When he opened the door to his room , he found it lit by one small lamp on the bedside table . Warm shadows blurred the hotel-style furnishings , lending a cozy air of invitation to the room , and there was a heady scent he had n't noticed before . The circle of light drew his attention to the bed where the covers had been turned back for him in best hotel fashion . But unlike any hotel he 'd experienced , there was a woman in his bed . " Hi , " she said in a husky voice . " Thought you might like some company . " Wang 's intern smiled at him . With one hand she slowly pushed the sheet down so he could see she was naked . Her body was lovely , full and rosy and inviting . He had an instant reaction to her invitation . Not so fast ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in bed sometime , just not this quick . His brain was overruled by the spreading warmth of his arousal . Do n't question gift horses ! " Come here and let me undo your shirt buttons . " She patted the bed beside her . " Whoa , Corinne , " he said . " This is a bit fast , do n't you think ? " " You deserve a little R and R. " " Damn straight ! " He dropped down on the bed beside her , aware of the Cabemet buzz that seemed to have unstrung his muscles , and let her fingers tiptoe over his bare chest . " You sure this would play okay with your boss ? " She pouted . " Why does he have to know what we do on our own time ? " That sounded reasonable . And nobody had told him not to fraternize with the staff . In fact , they had n't told him much of anything . Corinne probably went to bed with any guy with power in the building , but so what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd certainly earned it today . He could feel the tension of the day draining out of him at her touch . " That 's great . You 're wonderful . " She laughed . " I bet you say that to all the women . " " Not at all . I like women , but - " She covered his mouth with hers , cutting off his protest . That was the last coherent thought he had for a long while . Afterward , he lay back sweaty and exhausted with Corinne in the curve of his arm . Wang was probably going to be pissed if he found out , he thought , but thinking was still a hazy process and the thought slipped away in his general sense of well-being . " Whew ! " He shook his head . " Wow . " She propped herself up on an elbow and gazed down at him . " And I thought you were a language expert ! " she teased . " Stay right there , lover boy . I brought some wine . " He closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by this gorgeous young woman who apparently found him irresistible . He heard the sound of a cork being drawn and liquid splashing into glass . A moment later she said , " Hold still . " He felt her mouth close over his , gently forcing his lips to pan , then a small stream of wine made its way over his tongue and slid like cool fire down his throat . " Mmm . Great . " One word at a time seemed about all he could dredge up . " You ready for more ? " " Wine ... or sex ? " he managed to ask . He heard her throaty laugh again , and he wrapped both arms around her and pulled her down on his chest , spilling wine all over himself and the bed . He did n't care . She was right ; he 'd needed this . " Poor Jamal , " she whispered against his skin . " You were so tense . They 're expecting too much from you . " " They expect a miracle . " " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my boss obviously debriefs you on the details , but I 'll bet you do n't get to release the emotions you must be going through . Men never talk to each other about their emotions . " He tousled her hair playfully . She might be a power junkie , but there was that indefinable air of innocence about her that appealed to him . " Real men do n't have emotions . " " You could 've fooled me , " she said . The giddiness of the last few minutes faded slowly away and he lay back , his body pleasantly relaxed . " It does n't make any sense , Corinne . This guy-I have no clue what his name is or anything else about himhe 's got to be highly intelligent . I thought I was sharp , but I could n't learn a language anywhere near as fast as he seems to have done in just two sessions . " " You 're getting him to speak English ? Well , that 's progress , is n't it ? My boss thought he might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he does n't connect . No reaction to anything . No emotion . " " A real man ? " she teased . He punched her arm lightly . She rewarded him with another sip of wine by personal delivery . The combination of physical exhaustion , sex and alcohol was overwhelming . He felt as if he were floating . " Seems odd that we 're devoting so many resources to a vagrant , " she said . " Whatever he is , the guy 's not a vagrant . One look at him tells you he 's more than that . " " I do n't have the clearance to see him . Wang 's keeping him under wraps . " His head cleared suddenly and he was uneasy . If she did n't have clearance to see the alien , maybe he should n't be talking about him with her . Nobody had bothered to clue him in about who he could talk to and who not . Damn this cloak and dagger stuff . He hated it . But maybe he should be a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe Wang 's wrong and the guy 's just a nutcase , " he said , careful to keep his tone casual . " Actually , he sounds autistic , " she said . " I live with my sister and her youngest is autistic . Scores high on IQ tests , but he shows no emotional connection to the family , even his mother . " He rolled over on top of her . " Yeah , that 's probably it . Now . How about - " " If that 's the case , we should n't be keeping him locked up . Laws protecting people with disabilities have been on the books a very long time . And why 's the boss so secretive about him if he 's just a poor autistic person ? My sister knows a lot of people around here who 'd be upset about that if - " " People would be upset if they thought he was autistic ? " " You know what I mean . " She made another pouty face at him . " Let me show you what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back on safer ground . ALDO GLENYS WAS waiting for him the next morning , seated on a lounge near the elevator . The agent glanced at his watch as Jamal appeared . " So it 's almost noon . I 'm late , " Jamal said . " Why did n't you knock on my door ? " " You had company last night . I thought you might need some extra sleep . " Corinne had left before dawn , early enough no one would be around to see her , or so he 'd thought . " Ca n't keep anything from the NSA , apparently . " " It 's your business . Shall we get on with the government 's ? " He noted a cooler tone in the man 's voice and wondered again what exactly was Glenys 's role here . Obviously he had to be more than Jamal 's babysitter . He 'd started to slip into thinking of the situation as " Us : " himself , the alien , and Clenys , and " Them : " the two agents and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Glenys , he decided that might be a misjudgment . " Right . It 's my business , " he said . " And while we 're at it , I 'd like to request a change of scene . I 'm tired of staring at my reflection in a one-way mirror , knowing some NSA wonk is probably staring right back . " " What did you have in mind ? " Glenys 's face betrayed no reaction to the request . Almost as frustrating as talking to the alien , he thought . " A trip to the mall . A visit to the zoo . " He was amused to see a flicker of disapproval in Glenys 's eyes . " I doubt Wang will agree to a public appearance , " Glenys said dryly , touching the comm unit he wore . He spoke briefly for a couple of seconds , then touched the device to turn it off ; he palmed the sensor pad to summon the elevator . Neither spoke as the elevator moved . When the doors opened again on the floor where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agents waiting outside . Glenys 's comm pinged . Jamal walked on ahead , conscious of the murmured one-sided conversation behind him . " Yes sir - Of course - No , not at all - Yes sir . " " You tell Wang I 'm not working on this any further if I do n't have full control , " Jamal said over his shoulder . Fighting words the Tuskegee airman would 've approved , no doubt . The guard nodded to Jamal and opened the door . He went into the room . " Wang was n't happy about it , " Glenys said as he came in , followed by the agents . " But he gave permission for a brief outing on the grounds . We 're to make sure our friend does n't take his clothes off . " Jamal howled with laughter , startling the alien who was sitting at the table this morning . " Wang does n't want him attracting attention , " Glenys said lamely . " And we 're to have an armed escort . " He stopped laughing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of state troopers can just as quickly disappear in front of an armed escort . " " Maybe it 's for our protection . " " If he was going to harm us , he 's had a lot of opportunity to do it already ! " The alien was staring at them - taking it all in , understanding every word no doubt . Jamal felt disconnected this morning , further away from understanding than the day he 'd started . If what he 'd just said to Clenys was right , why was the alien still here ? Presumably he could leave any time he wanted . His presence meant he still wanted something . His mission is to learn about us , Glenys had said . But what was he learning ? And he himself was no further along . Without a single example of the alien 's language , he could n't begin to test his hypothesis . If this was the way things were going to be in the future , a series of confusing , frustrating encounters with aliens , he did n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said abruptly . It came out lezgo , and he was perversely glad to see by the alien 's brief hesitation that he did n't immediately grasp the ellipsis . Humans one . Extraterrestrials zero , he thought sourly . " And you can tell Tweedledum and Tweedledee they 're not wanted on the expedition . " Glenys started to argue , then stopped and made a small motion with his hand to the agents . They stayed behind as Jamal escorted the alien out of the room . He saw right away he 'd only won a partial victory . Two young soldiers in paisley camouflage fatigues with automatics bulking black against their hips fell in with them as they walked to the elevator . The alien towered over all of them . Five crowded into the cab 's small space was claustrophobic . Nobody spoke . He was aware of his arm pressed against the alien 's arm . There was no electric tingle , no sensation of power conveyed one way or the other in the contact today . Reassuring , but also disappointing . Outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool wind laced with the smell of wet earth promising a storm before evening . One on either side of the alien , Jamal and Glenys walked ahead of the soldiers who dropped a few paces behind . They headed for a small stand of immature fir trees . A hundred yards away , a group of men in dark suits and women carrying briefcases and bright umbrellas hurried toward a bland stone building , its roof bristling with antennae and sprouting dishes like ears tuned to the world 's secrets . One woman in a pink raincoat reminded him of Wang 's intern . Overhead , a dark , unmarked chopper tilted quietly in , heading for an unseen landing site , its rotors churning the damp air , chilling the back of his neck . He pulled up the collar of his parka . New scenery meant an opportunity for new vocabulary , and he supplied it . Tree , cone , grass , stone , rain , dirt , sky , cloud , bird , wind , car - all either pointed at or pantomimed . But no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The rain that falls is cold , " the alien said suddenly . " But all things that live on Earth need water . " They both stared at him . Jamal became aware his mouth was open and shut it hurriedly . " Where did he learn embedded structure ? " " The videos I gave him to watch last night , probably . " Jamal shook his head . " Do you ever think this might not be such a good idea ? " " All the time , " Glenys said . Ahead of them lay a small ornamental pond , dappled with the light rain ; it appeared to be a recent addition along with the spindly trees , a green breathing space , an afterthought in the middle of all the concrete . The pond was occupied by two ducks and an opportunistic seagull . A stone bench had been placed under firs that needed another couple of years " growth before they 'd provide shade ; beside it , a trash receptacle . It was a place where staff could eat lunch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fortress of Fort Meade , its high wire fence just a few yards away . A very human kind of place , he thought , kind of like Planet Earth itself , small , insignificant , surrounded by a vast and hostile space . He sat with Glenys , watching the alien who had moved to the water 's edge and was apparently observing the birds . What was he learning about this planet he 'd landed on , Jamal wondered , and what would he do with the information ? One thing was certain , he did n't see any need to confide his impressions to his hosts . The soldiers loitered a few paces away ; he heard one murmuring into his comm unit . Thunder rolled briefly in the distance ; there was an electric urgency in the air . Going to be a wet afternoon , he thought . " Why ca n't I get through to him , Glenys ? He 's obviously intelligent enough to understand what we want . " " Dangerous to make assumptions . It 's a disadvantage that he looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ducks approached him hopefully through the gray mist of rain , trailing long vees in the water . The gull took flight , circling his head , squawking harshly . " Hard to believe this is really happening , is n't it ? Here we are with a real freaking alien , and people going about their business outside that fence with absolutely no idea . " " Just as well . Not a lot of sympathy for us from civilians at any time . We have a full-time protest group outside the main gate . " " What 're they protesting ? " " Anything and everything . Our existence , I guess . " Jamal felt unsettled , as if he were about to come down with the flu . " You know what really bothers me ? Where are the others ? He ca n't have come any great distance through space all by himself . " " We 're working on that . " " ' We ? ' " " NASA , mostly . Other agencies I 'm not at liberty to name . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at them . " We keep coming back to the same question : Why is he here at all ? " " To learn our language ? It may be the only thing we have that 's worth taking right now . " " If that 's the case , he had the opportunity to leam several before I got to him . " " His race is obviously far ahead of ours technically . They 're not afraid to drop a live being in Maryland for the initial contact instead of an automated probe . " " Damn lucky choice ! Showing up naked in public some places around the world would 've got him killed immediately . " " At least we ask questions first , " Glenys said . Jamal took his frustration out by lobbing small green pine cones into the trash can . The rain came down harder . " Time to go inside . " When he looked back at the pond , the alien was n't there . " What the hell ? Glenys - Where 'd he go ? Where is he ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed . " He 's heading for the main gate . " The alien was loping steadily in a straight line across the parking lot toward the high , armored fence surrounding the NSA compound . Jamal was astounded at how far he 'd gone already . He 'd only taken his eye off the alien for a moment . " The guards will stop him at the gate , " Glenys said . " They have orders not to let anyone in or out without authorization . " " That 's what I 'm afraid of . He 'll walk right into their weapons ! " Alarmed by Jamal 's outburst , the two escort soldiers had unholstered their guns . " Just catch him , " he shouted at them . " Do n't shoot him ! " He broke into a run , yelling : " Wait ! " Not a word he 'd introduced yet . Damn . He was afraid that any minute the alien would get shot or repeat his stunning appearance in reverse . Wang was going to nail his hide to the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his muscles , he pounded across the tarmac . He could see the main gate in the fence and a dark-colored limousine making its way through into the compound . The guards apparently had n't noticed the alien running toward them yet ; their attention seemed drawn to something happening outside the gate . Now he could see a small crowd of people gathering out there , some of them unfolding a banner . The alien had almost reached the gate before the guards noticed him . Jamal saw their weapons swing up into position . " Do n't do it ! " he yelled . " Friend ! " He was breathing heavily , slowing in spite of his urgent need to keep going . There was a bitter , metallic taste in his mouth . Glenys streaked past him , one arm high displaying his ID , shouting something Jamal could n't make out . The black chopper reappeared overhead and circled the gate . He caught the glint of a gun muzzle through the open hatch . No ! he thought . They do n't understand ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banner dipping up and down . Now he was close enough to read its hand-lettered message : RIGHTS FOR THE DISABLED . The barrier had not had time to come all the way down after the limousine went through . And the alien stopped suddenly just inside the gate , holding his arms out wide as if to embrace the little crowd . One of the gate guards went down under the protestors who clambered over him to get inside . With his last burst of energy , Jamal leaped forward in a futile attempt to reach the alien . He collided with a burly man who knocked him down and fell on top of him . His head smacked against the concrete , and for a moment his vision blurred and he went deaf . His arm flared with pain . Then sound returned and he became aware of a female voice saying over and over . " I 'm so sorry ! I did n't mean for you to get hurt ! " He looked up into the panic-stricken face of Wang intern kneeling beside him . Her short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raincoat . " I told my sister this morning - we share everything with each other , " Corinne said , tears streaming down her face . " But I did n't mean for this to happen . I do n't want to lose my job . " He tried to pat her shoulder reassuringly but his muscles would n't obey him . He felt woozy , his eyes not focusing properly as he stared past her at Aldo Glenys . Glenys had his gun drawn . He saw a flash and heard the crack that split the air . THE ROOM WAS dark , cold , smelling of rubber and antiseptic . Jamal heard something humming quietly to itself in the silence . One arm was in a cast from shoulder to wrist , and his ribs were taped up . He became aware of an intravenous shunt on the back of his free hand . " You were very lucky , " Aldo Glenys 's voice said in the darkness . " You have a concussion , but you could 've been killed . " " The alien ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit up and groaned as pain flared in his ribs . " You killed him ? " " By the time we got it sorted out , he was n't to be found . " " Disappeared ? Like he suddenly appeared ? Dammit , Glenys ! Give it to me straight . " " Lie still . You have a couple of cracked ribs as well as a broken arm . The official word is there was no one here to disappear . A false rumor set the disabled rights activists off . A misunderstanding , no basis to it ! " " We killed him and his friends took the body . " Glenys gazed at him for a moment . " I 'm not confirming any part of that . But you have a more immediate problem . Wang 's not about to forgive you for letting this opportunity get away . He went out on a limb with the Agency by bringing you in . The secretary of Defense advised more traditional methods of interrogation . " He thought of Corinne in the pink raincoat , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Wang ' 8 intern ? " " I believe the young lady has resigned . " " It was n't her fault . That demonstration - " " The demonstration had nothing to do with it . We get them all the time . " " So then ? " Glenys shrugged . " What 's your role in this , Glenys ? " " I did n't shoot him , if that 's what you 're thinking . " But you would've. given the chance . Jamal lay back , feeling defeated . He had n't asked for any of this , but being in , he 'd wanted a better , less ambiguous outcome . " I did the best any linguist could . " " Not good enough . We 're going to have to do better . " " What 's that supposed to mean ? " " Time for a new specialty , " Glenys said . " We 're going to need Xenolinguists next time . " " You really believe there 'll be a next time ? " " Do n't you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It had seemed so easy before he met his first alien . He 'd been showing off when he speculated about universal language as part of his dissertation , never expecting to have the opportunity to test his hypothesis . And he still had n't tested human ability to crack an alien language . Maybe communication was n't possible . Light streamed through the door as a nurse entered with a tray , and he shut his eyes against the painful brightness . She turned on the room lights , making it worse . " Glad you 're awake , Mr. Lenana , " she said . " Got to take your meds now . " " Morphine would be good . " She ignored this and handed him two pills and a small paper cup of water , waited to see him take them , then left . " Wang ca n't prevent me from writing up a paper on the problem , " he said when the door closed behind the nurse . " Nothing happened here . No journal will take it . You 'll be just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free society last time I checked , bro . " Glenys stood up and retrieved a raincoat from the back of his chair . " I think you 'll find you 've come to a dead end . " " I do n't accept that ! " " Do n't sweat it . Better that you put your skills into the needs of the future . " He could neither trust Glenys nor bring himself to distrust him . He suspected there was a lot more depth to the man than his agency training alone would suggest . " Aldo - " he began . " I 've decided to retire from the Agency . Going home to Switzerland . " " Giving up , " he said harshly . " Well , I do n't give up ! When I get out of here , first thing I 'm going to do is finish climbing Kilimanjaro . Ca n't let not finishing things become a habit . Then I 'll test your hypothesis about publishing a paper . " " Do that , " Glenys said . " And when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and see me . I 've put my card on your table . Forget what happened here , Jamal . We 'll talk about how to prepare to handle the next visitors whenever they show up . We may not get off so easily next time . " After Glenys had gone , he lay staring at the ceiling , thinking it over . Even if he personally never saw another alien in his life , he knew humanity 's long isolation was over . Someone had to be prepared to deal with the aliens who would surely come . And who better than himself to figure out how to prepare-What was Aldo 's term ? - Xenolinguists . Awkward word . But given the way languages evolved , it would probably be simplified before too long . Even there , he thought as the painkillers started to take hold , the future began with one word . - For Denaire
