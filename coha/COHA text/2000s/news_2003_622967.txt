<p> In the final act of a yearlong drama surrounding the Bay Area 's most successful and high-profile sports franchise and its charismatic and popular coach , the 49ers fired Steve Mariucci on Wednesday , six years to the day after it hired him to the prestigious throne . <p> Team owner Dr. John York said in a conference call that " philosophical " issues prevented him from keeping Mariucci as coach , citing obstacles both " major and minor " in allowing him to stay on for the last year of his contract . <p> The move closes a simmering power struggle at a franchise known for its dramatic coaching and personnel issues , and it makes Mariucci the first coach since 1978 to leave San Francisco without winning a Super Bowl . The high-stakes theater was evident in Mariucci 's departure from team headquarters Wednesday afternoon  --  in a black van with drawn curtains behind the driver . <p> Mariucci , hired by the Carmen Policy-Dwight Clark regime in 1997 , long felt isolated by the newer power structure  --  consultant Bill Walsh , who rejoined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who arrived the same year . York alluded to that in explaining the firing . <p> " I did n't think it was best to have a lame duck coach , " York said . " I thought it best to have a coach we were fully committed to . There was enough noise about Steve Mariucci as our head coach , about Steve vs . Bill , about Steve vs . Terry Donahue , about whether or not we love Steve . There was too much noise . <p> " You ca n't have all that and move the team along . " <p> MORE POWER SOUGHT ? <p> Donahue , in a noon press conference at team headquarters , said the firing was not performance-related . Instead , Donahue said , Mariucci 's desire for more power in the organization  --  a request that dates to last year , he said  --  proved a problem . In addition , last February 's very public episode in which Mariucci met with owners of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers about a job  --  plus an even earlier flirtation with Notre Dame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I think this is a situation in which a relationship eroded over a period of time , " Donahue said . " I think Steve and John have a relationship , but I think it has been strained over a period of time from last year . . . also , some of the things that arose out of the Tampa Bay issue . <p> " Also , it was stated very directly and plainly that Steve would like to have his role increased with the 49ers . I think when you go through all those things , that eventually wears on a relationship . " <p> Said York : " ( The Tampa Bay issue ) certainly was something I believed both of us have gotten over , but I wo n't say either one of us had forgotten it . " <p> York told Mariucci of his firing in a 90-minute morning meeting in Mariucci 's office , although one source said Mariucci learned of the axing on television even before York entered the building . Mariucci did not speak to local reporters but has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , give an interview to ESPN.com Wednesday , contradicting the 49ers ' public statements about his desire for more power , specifically the title of vice president of football operations . <p> ' I 'M SHOCKED ' <p> " I 'm surprised to listen and learn that ( purported request for more power and the title ) was an issue at all , " Mariucci told the Web site . " I guess I 'm shocked to hear that part of it . " <p> Mariucci 's new agent , Gary O'Hagan , denied ever making that demand in his only meeting with York  --  in St. Louis on Dec. 30 , the day of the 49ers-Rams game  --  and instead said it was the 49ers who raised that issue . York grew testy when asked which side was telling the truth . <p> " If this is going to turn into a ' we said , ' ' they said , ' I 'm not interested in getting into that , " York said . " I know what Steve said last year , I know what Steve 's agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . " <p> Said Mariucci to ESPN.com : " I 'm just surprised and saddened  --  I did n't see it coming . Really , I did n't . I have a lot of admiration for this place , and I 've invested a lot here . So , sure , I wanted to stay and finish what we had set out to do . " <p> There had been widespread speculation that the 49ers might try to work out a compensation package with the Jacksonville Jaguars , who are searching for a head coach and are believed to be interested in Mariucci . Last year , the Raiders received four draft picks and $8 million from Tampa Bay in exchange for releasing coach Jon Gruden from the last year of his contract . But any thought of the 49ers swinging a similar deal was squashed by the NFL on Tuesday , when the league issued a moratorium on such trades . <p> Donahue said the moratorium , which extends to March 31 , spiked any consideration of the 49ers gaining compensation for releasing Mariucci from his contract . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 57-39 record and four playoff appearances in six years . He earned $2.1 million last year and was to earn $2.2 million next year . York said Mariucci would be paid according to a clause in his contract , though KGO radio broadcaster Gary Plummer said that payment would only be $733,000 , or one-third of Mariucci 's 2003 salary . The money was due Mariucci after York , in one of his first moves on the job in 1999 , signed Mariucci to a five-year contract extension . <p> Even before the Tampa Bay flirtation , a rift started when Mariucci talked to Notre Dame about its coaching vacancy during the 49ers ' 2001 season . York , though , is a Notre Dame alum and financial contributor who was aware and involved in Mariucci 's talks with Notre Dame Athletic Director Kevin White . When Mariucci told Notre Dame he would not pursue the job , he told confidants he did it with York in his office , and he embraced York after hanging up the phone . But seeds of discontent were being sown , as those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The tension between owner and coach is a part of 49ers lore by now and dates back to the days Ed DeBartolo  --  York 's brother-in-law  --  and Walsh butted heads during Walsh 's tenure , when the 49ers won Super Bowls in the 1981 , 1984 and 1988 seasons . Walsh retired after the 1988 season , in part because of burnout from the intense pressure of the job . <p> George Seifert succeeded Walsh and won Super Bowls in the 1989 and 1994 seasons  --  only to be fired by DeBartolo after losing to the Green Bay Packers in the playoffs two consecutive years , in 1995 and 1996 . Mariucci was hired to replace Seifert and enjoyed a honeymoon in 1997 when he took the 49ers to the NFC Championship Game , where they lost to Green Bay . <p> SUCCEEDED IN TOUGH TIMES <p> When DeBartolo lost control of the team because of legal troubles , and when team president Policy  --  considered Mariucci 's benefactor  --  left for Cleveland during the 1998 season , Mariucci gained York 's respect by holding the team together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walsh settled in upstairs , and when Mariucci talked to Notre Dame and Tampa Bay , that goodwill was tested . <p> The sequence of events leading to the firing began Monday night , when Mariucci and York , who was in Youngstown , Ohio , had a phone conversation that left York feeling a change was necessary . York then phoned Donahue at home around 9:30 p.m. to inform him of the conversation , and Donahue said York " expressed to me some very strong concerns " about keeping Mariucci . <p> That the relationship soured is not a surprise to those close to Mariucci , who said the coach was never sure of his relationship with his owner after the Tampa Bay incident last February . Mariucci guided the 49ers to the NFC West title and a second consecutive playoff berth this year despite that cloud , and then decided he would like to coach through the 2003 season even without an extension . <p> He and his wife , Gayle , live in the South Bay and have four school-age children  --  sons Tyler , 18 ; Adam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 7  --  and wanted to stay in a place they enjoyed living . <p> YORK HAD ALREADY DECIDED <p> But York 's mind was made up , the owner said , even before Mariucci made a face-to-face plea in their Wednesday morning meeting . It was York 's belief that Mariucci 's desire for more power in personnel issues would interfere with York 's preferred flow chart for the team  --  with Donahue as general manager , Walsh as consultant and John McVay as vice president/director of football operations . <p> " It was clear to me that the way Steve saw this organization was clearly different from how I did , " York said . " ( Mariucci 's preference for more power ) was brought up last year when Steve asked for an extension . He asked for a number of areas of control outside his head coaching role . <p> " And this year , when I met Gary O'Hagan for the first time in St. Louis , one of the things Gary said is that Steve would like to be V.P. of football operations when and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's desire would infringe on his responsibilities as general manager , Donahue answered : " I 'm assuming it would have . " <p> In essence , then , Mariucci lost a power play when he asked York to choose between himself and the Donahue-Walsh faction . Donahue continued to deny , however , that he gave anything less than full support to the coach . <p> " I think Steve Mariucci received as much support and cooperation as any coach could ever want , " Donahue said . " I do not feel at all like we were in a position of not supporting our coach . I think that is folly . " <p> SPECULATION ON NEW COACH <p> Speculation as to Mariucci 's successor began immediately , and York said he would consider both an internal hire  --  defensive coordinator Jim Mora is considered a head coaching candidate  --  and an African American hire . Already , former Stanford and Minnesota Vikings coach Dennis Green told ESPN , for whom he works , that he would like to be considered . <p> " I 've always considered myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have some interest in that job . " <p> York and Mariucci shook hands and embraced at the end of the meeting , around 11:30 a.m . York said both a " business obligation " and his emotional fatigue prevented him from joining Donahue at the noon press conference . <p> " This is a difficult day , " York said . " Steve has been a very good , a great coach for us . I think you all know we 've supported him all four years . We were supportive during our two years of not winning , and we 've been supportive the last two years . <p> " Steve 's been a good friend , we 've done things together , but this is something I thought was necessary to move things forward .
