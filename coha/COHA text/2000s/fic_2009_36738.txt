MAY 25 <br> <br> THE MEETING LOCATION HAD BEEN CHOSEN FOR ITS isolation , an abandoned Catholic church on the east side of a little-used road fifty kilometers northwest of Cork , Ireland , near the border between County Tipperary and County Cork . The structure that remained was all but invisible from the road . One of those places only a local would know about , then forget over time . <br> As a bonus , no one lived within a kilometer and a half of the ruins , making it a natural choice for an exchange . In the two days Jonathan Quinn had been scouting the location , no more than a dozen cars a day had driven past , and not a single one had even slowed , let alone stopped . <br> The roof of the church had long since disappeared , leaving only the gray , pitted stone walls of the chapel . Encouraged by the wet Irish climate , vegetation had grown up around the building , both surrounding it and filling the inside . It was as if a congregation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priest who had yet to arrive . <br> Nearby , an untended cemetery provided the only reminder that people had once worshipped here . Quinn did n't know how long the compound had been abandoned , but the most recent grave marker he 'd located had been for someone named Maureen Owens , year of death 1889 . So it was n't hard to imagine that it had been at least a century since any parishioners had gathered between the chapel walls . <br> Quinn did a last walk-through just after noon , careful to step only on broken stones or patches of grass to avoid leaving any trace of his presence . He double-checked to make sure all the cameras and microphones were well hidden and working . When he was satisfied , he returned on foot to the van parked a half kilometer away . <br> The meeting was scheduled for nine that evening . According to the agreed-upon terms , the informant was to arrive from the south , while the man from Quinn 's client  --  an organization known as the Office  --  was to come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park a quarter kilometer from the location and walk the rest of the way in . They were to meet inside the church , with each participant allowed to bring one associate . Once they had all arrived , the informant would give the Office 's agent certain information in exchange for what Quinn assumed was a generous cash payment . <br> The details of the exchange , what the information was and what the informant was earning for his efforts , were none of Quinn 's business . He was a cleaner . His job was to watch and observe , and  --  only if necessary  --  clean up any mess that might occur . <br> As Quinn reached the back of the van , the right side door swung open . Quinn 's apprentice Nate was hunched inside , a Glock 19 pistol in his right hand . <br> " Ground check ? " Nate asked . <br> " We 're all set , " Quinn replied . <br> Nate relaxed . While he had no doubt been watching Quinn 's approach  --  first on the cameras stationed around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had seen his boss return alone , there was always the possibility someone had gotten to Quinn in one of the dead areas , and was waiting just beyond the camera 's view . But Quinn had answered Nate 's question with the prearranged all-clear signal . <br> The apprentice moved aside and let Quinn enter , then leaned out and pulled the door shut . <br> The van had been transformed into a mobile observation post . But unlike those fancy ones in the movies , here little attention had been paid to the human component . A half-dozen small flat-screen monitors were mounted on the right wall . Five were receiving signals from the ten cameras back at the church , each monitor assigned to two cameras , and automatically toggling back and forth every five seconds . The sixth monitor was digitally divided into four smaller screens displaying different views of the surveillance van and the surrounding area . Below the monitors , twenty-eight digital recorders  --  each no larger than a paperback book  --  were hung in portable racks . Two recorders per feed , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't enough , there was a satellite link sending a real-time signal back to the Office 's headquarters in Washington , D.C. <br> State-of-the-art equipment all . It was the two plastic chairs and the banged-up portable ice chest that seemed out of place . <br> " You check in with Peter ? " Quinn asked . Peter was the head of the Office , and the man who had hired them . <br> " Fifteen minutes ago , " Nate said as he settled into the chair nearest the back of the van . " We did another connection test . Signal strength is steady . I flipped it to black , so they 're not getting anything at the moment . " <br> " Any more interference from the cameras ? " Quinn said . <br> Nate shook his head . " Everything seems fine now . I think we 're ready . " <br> " Keep an eye on them , " Quinn said , nodding toward the monitors . " If anything acts up again , let me know . " <br> " You going somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the equipment rack , then stretched out on the floor . " As far away from here as I can , " he said as he closed his eyes . " Wake me in two hours if there are n't any more problems . " <br> " Yeah , sure , " Nate said . " I 'll just . . . stay here . " <br> " Stay alert . " Quinn tapped the cooler with his foot . " Have a Red Bull , if you need one . " <br> Nate said something under his breath . <br> Quinn opened one eye . " What ? " <br> " Nothing . " <br> Quinn stared for a moment longer , then closed the eye . " I could have left you in Los Angeles , you know . " <br> He could sense Nate wanting to say something more , but his apprentice remained silent . <br> At five minutes to nine , the Office 's agent , a veteran operative named David Otero , arrived . With him was William Ownby , the allotted second man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church , then entered the abandoned sanctuary . <br> Peter had told Quinn that Otero and Ownby would have no knowledge of Quinn 's presence . That was n't unusual . Quinn and Nate were n't there as backup . They were there for an entirely different reason . One Otero and Ownby would n't have wanted to consider . <br> Nate glanced at his watch . " It 's three minutes after nine . Our other guest is running behind . " <br> Quinn nodded , but said nothing . The second party had been told the meet would take place somewhere in the south of Ireland , but had only been given the exact location three hours earlier . And the church was n't the easiest place in the world to find . <br> " Hold on , " Nate said . " Lights . " <br> Quinn used a handheld joystick to pan a camera that was covering the road to the south a little to the right , centering a pair of distant headlights moving toward the church . For a moment , they disappeared as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had measured the distance that morning . The vehicle was just under a kilometer away . <br> A moment later , the car reappeared , and less than thirty seconds later it began to slow . <br> " Approaching the turnout , " Nate said . <br> On the screen , the car slowed to almost a crawl , then pulled off into the wide spot in the road , and its lights were turned off . <br> Quinn leaned forward and pushed a button on a rectangular metal box mounted in the rack . Next to the button was a speaker , and just above that a microphone was mounted on a five-inch gooseneck extender . <br> " Peter , you getting this ? " Quinn asked , then let go of the button . <br> " Yes . That 's got to be them . " Though Peter 's voice came through the speaker , the quality was so good it sounded like he was in the van with them . <br> Quinn glanced back at one of the monitors covering the inside of the church . Otero had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Ownby had taken up a less visible position in a nook near the north entrance . If either man was getting impatient , they did n't show it . <br> Four minutes later , one of the microphones picked up the sound of footsteps approaching the church . <br> " Everything recording ? " Quinn asked . <br> Nate glanced at a small LCD monitor mounted on a swivel arm next to the hard drives . He pressed one of the buttons on the touch-screen menu . The display changed to a set of green lights . <br> " All drives recording , " he said , then glanced over his shoulder toward the communication equipment . " Satellite link steady and strong . " <br> Quinn pushed the button that connected him with the Office . " Approaching the church now . " <br> " Good , " Peter said . " Let 's get this over with . " <br> Otero must have also heard the footsteps . He stood up , and put a cautious hand on the bulge in his jacket pocket before looking back at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ownby reached under his jacket and pulled out a gun , a Beretta 9mm . From his pocket he pulled out a long cylinder , a suppressor , and attached it to the end of the barrel . <br> The footsteps stopped just beyond the walls of the church . Then silence for almost a minute . <br> " I do n't see them , " Nate said . <br> " They 're there , " Quinn said . <br> " I know . But I do n't see them . " <br> There were a series of numbered buttons on the base of the joystick Quinn was holding . He punched number 8 and began panning a camera covering the outside of the church 's south end . <br> " There , " Nate said , pointing at the monitor for camera eight . <br> Quinn could see them now . There were two of them , crouched low and half-hidden by the thick brush . As Quinn and Nate watched , one of the men sprinted forward , stopping only when he reached the outside of the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to what had once been a doorway , and peered inside . <br> " Are we going to play games , or are we going to meet ? " It was Otero . He was still standing in the middle of the church , not concealing his presence . When there was no response , he said , " Two minutes and we 're leaving . " <br> The man who had been looking into the church from the doorway glanced back at his partner and waved for him to come over . <br> " Quinn , " Nate said . <br> " What ? " <br> " I thought they were only allowed one companion . " <br> Quinn shot Nate a glance , then looked at a monitor Nate was pointing at . It was the one covering the north approach to the church , the way Otero and Ownby had come . <br> " I do n't see anything , " Quinn said . <br> " In the tree , " Nate said . He leaned forward and touched the screen . <br> For half a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight movement revealed the form of a man lying prone on one of the branches , facing toward the church . <br> A quick glance at a monitor that gave a broader view of that side of the church confirmed Quinn 's suspicion that the man was high enough to see through the missing roof into the abandoned structure . <br> Quinn pushed the mic button again . " Peter , we have a problem . " <br> " What ? " <br> " Check the feed to camera six . In the tree , near the top of the image . " <br> There was a pause . <br> " Do you see him ? " Quinn asked . <br> " Yes . " <br> " Is he one of yours ? " <br> " I played by the rules . Only two , " Peter said . " He must be one of theirs . " <br> Quinn was n't convinced of that , but there was no time to argue the point . On another monitor the two newcomers stepped through the doorway , entered the church , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervous , like this was the first time they had ever done anything like this . <br> " You need to abort right now , " Quinn said . <br> " We need that information , " Peter said . <br> " Peter , " Quinn said , " if you do n't abort , you might not get anything . " <br> At the church Otero said , " You guys are going to have to come a little closer . " <br> The taller of the two men shook his head . " We are fine here . I think you have something to show us . " <br> Otero smiled , then tossed a coin in the air so that it landed a foot in front of his counterparts . <br> " Your turn , " Otero said . <br> The tall man tossed his own coin toward Otero . This was the prearranged recognition signal . Otero had been carrying a fifty-yen Japanese coin , and the informant a 1998 Canadian half-dollar . <br> " Peter ! " Quinn said . <br> " The meet 's already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer their phones until they 're back in their car . " <br> " They might not even make it back to their car , " Quinn said , then let go of the button . <br> " We can start the van , " Nate suggested . " That should throw everyone into a panic . We could even fire off a shot . " <br> It was an excellent idea , Quinn thought . He relayed it to Peter . <br> There was a pause , then Peter said , " Do it . " <br> Quinn pulled his SIG Sauer   out of the holster under his left arm as Nate moved toward the back door to open it . <br> Several rapid flashes from one of the monitors caught Quinn 's eye . It was the one showing the close-up of the man in the tree . He glanced at the view of the church . Otero , Ownby , and the man who had been talking for the other party were all on the ground and not moving . <br> The final man had just exited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then there was another flash . The man jerked to the left , his momentum dropping him into a bush at the side of the trail . Like the others , he did n't get up . <br> " Stop , " Quinn said to Nate . <br> The door was already half opened . <br> " Close it . Quietly . " <br> Nate shut the door as Quinn sat back down . <br> Quinn pushed the button . " Your op is blown . " <br> " I can fucking see that , " Peter said . " Goddammit ! You need to keep whoever that is from getting to the bodies . One of those guys is carrying something we need . " <br> " Do n't know if you noticed , " Quinn said , " but your men are probably dead . That guy in the tree 's got a silenced rifle , and I 'm not really interested in walking into his range . " <br> " Do what you were going to do before ! Scare him off . He 's not going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep breath , then nodded at Nate to open the door again . He checked monitor six . The assassin was holding his position , waiting to see if anyone else was going to show up . <br> Quinn pulled one of the remote communication sets from a bag near the recorders . He slipped the receiver over his ear , then climbed out of the van . <br> " Talk me in , " he said to Nate . <br> " You 're going to try to take him out ? " Nate asked , surprised . <br> Quinn shook his head . " I 'm just going to convince him to go someplace else . " <br> " You want your suppressor ? " Nate asked . <br> Quinn paused for a second . If things went as planned , he 'd need the noise of the shot to scare the guy off . But if things got off track ? <br> " Toss it to me , " he said . <br> Nate disappeared for a second , then stepped back into the doorway and threw a dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front pocket of his jacket as best he could . Once it was secure , he nodded back at the van . " Talk me in . You 're my eyes , so try not to get me killed . " <br> Continues ...
