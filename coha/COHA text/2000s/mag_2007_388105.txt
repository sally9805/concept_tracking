Headnote Adorn a clean background with bold elements for a fresh , friendly look // THE LEAST-EXPECTED design combinations are sometimes the most rewarding . For Mariam and Michael Mader of San Francisco , learning to juxtapose styles all started with a traditional Victorian , which they hoped to turn into a comfortable home fully reflecting their taste and life story . A previous renovation in the 1980s had resulted in faux-marble Grecian columns in the living room and several sets of mismatched moldings . " We wanted to strip away the intensely ornate stuff , " Michael says . " But we did n't want to turn a Victorian into a modern showcase . " There was one other important consideration : the couple 's cherished collection of global souvenirs , amassed on trips to farflung flea markets and bazaars . " We love to travel-it 's one of our passions , " Mariam says . " Plus , I 'm half-Iranian , and I wanted a home that reminded me of places where I grew up : Egypt , Iran , Kuwait , Lebanon . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Lisle , it 's less of a stretch than you think . " Victorians have a Moorish character about them , " he says , noting the intricate detailing common to both styles . The key to making it work : Highlight the pattern and texture of both styles against a cleanlined , contemporary backdrop . Mariam and de Lisle started with one bold hit in an otherwise minimal space-the eye-catching fabric on the living room armchairs , which complements the neo-Victorian details of the fireplace mantel . An octagonal Moroccan coffee table gives the room a strong visual anchor . For a more serene effect , de Lisle mixed a variety of subtle surfaces in the kitchen : anigr wood cabinetry with ridged glass fronts , porcelain floor tiles , and variegated marble counters and backsplash . An antiqued mirror behind the sink " keeps everything from looking too new , " de Lisle says . Personalized touches Upstairs , the master bedroom 's subdued palette of blues and grays is drawn from a shimmery swatch of the fabric that Mariam installed on her headboard . The handmade blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the moody feel of a hammam Middle Eastern bathhouse . " Creative uses for the couple 's cache of treasures are displayed throughout . In the dining room , a pair of Moroccan lanterns unearthed at the Paris flea market is now a dramatic light fixture suspended from a teak bar . For art , de Lisle took an image from the couple 's photo album-a memorable lunch in Morocco-and had a vibrant detail of a pink chair enlarged 26,000 times , then mounted on PVC plastic . The result is abstract , compelling , and one of a kind . Plus , at around $300 , it was relatively affordable . Warmly contemporary and full of surprising contrasts , the traditional Victorian is now a home with a new soul . As Mariam says , " Living with personal pieces and memories has given me some of my biggest joys .
