 --  Young man , let me look at you . <br> The room was broad , and lit from behind by massive windows that lined the dark mahogany-paneled wall . Light came through in a vague haze , sifted just beyond the glass by the leaves of the oaks from the street . A large man , my uncle , came around the desk towards me . <br> I , smiling , nodding , trying to look agreeable . My uncle fatter than he had been . But happy . Fat and happy . That 's the way . An important man in the governing of the city , my uncle had always been far too busy to bother with such as me. <br>  --  My boy , you seem well . Not too long , coming down here on the train ? There was an accident just yesterday . Someone got pushed . <br> The way he said it made it sound like the city was a sort of theatrical production . <br>  --  Not long , I said quietly . I had my book . <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of letters that desperate Russian poets had sent to an old German poet and he to them during a summer near the beginning of the century . My uncle did not look down at the book , but came around it and slapped me on the back . <br>  --  Good , good , he said . ( An embrace. ) <br>  --  You 've had your hair cut , have n't you ? he asked . Cut with a straight razor , looks like . <br>  --  Yes , I said , just now . I do it myself , a couple times a year . <br>  --  You use a mirror ? he asked . <br>  --  No , I said , just a razor and a comb . In fact , I close my eyes . <br>  --  Not bad , he said . It 's the old way , is n't it ? Way they used to do it . . . I 'd like to see that . Tell me next time , and I 'll send the car . <br> He gave me another pat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sat down with the air of a man who has often sat down in the presence of others who remain standing . <br>  --  I have given your situation some thought , Selah . I understand there was this business in C. , and I know it distracted you for a while , but god damn it , man , you 've got to get yourself together . These scraps of paper . . . <br> He held up several of my pamphlets . I sat up straight . <br>  --  It just wo n't do you any good . No conceivable good . <br>  --  I . . . <br>  --  Enough of that , he said . I have conferred with some old friends and I am going to install you in a position of which I feel you are certainly capable . There is a man I know , Levkin . He 's an odd man , but trustworthy . I think you can gain much from his acquaintance . <br> He pressed a button behind his desk , and a door on the far side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had evidently been waiting there some time , but he gave no sign of it . Nodding to my uncle , he immediately addressed me. <br>  --  Selah Morse ? <br> I nodded . A strange-looking man . He was the sort you could never recall anything about afterwards . Featureless . Not that he did n't have features . He was of a certain height , of a certain weight , etc. , but they did n't add up to anything . He was more of an average weight , an average height . If he left the room , who would remember him ? <br>  --  This way , please . <br> He looked at me as I stood there , book in hand . <br> My uncle nodded . <br>  --  I think you 'll find the work pleasant . <br> Come see me in a week or so . We 'll lunch together . I know a place . . . . <br> But already I was following the featureless man through the paneling and down a set of stairs . <br> At the bottom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street . I tried to place it in my memory in case I ever needed to get up to my uncle 's office on the quick . In my head I imagined an enormous house , a mansion I had visited once as a boy . I walked in the front door , along the central hallway . On the right was a room made expressly for telephoning . I entered it , pulled tight the door . Beside the telephone on the nightstand , I placed the idea of this secret entranceway to my uncle 's office . Quietly then I exit first the telephone-room , then the mansion , shutting carefully the doors . <br>  --  Call me Levkin , the man said shortly . <br> I nodded . There was no need to say my name . <br> I followed Levkin down the block . He had a rapid way of walking with hardly any wasted motion . He turned several times , finally coming to a sort of pocket-park . In the center , a building . We crossed the park , mounted the steps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of monkey-faced key . <br> Within there was a large room . A desk stood opposite the door . On it a girl lay sleeping . She was quite slender , and expensively dressed . She gave one the impression of a cat , insomuch as were one to wake her it seemed she would only stalk off to some other equally unlikely napping place , there to resume her slumber . <br> I looked at Levkin . He had his finger over his lips . Softly he said : <br>  --  That 's Rita , the message-girl. <br>  --  Messages for what ? I whispered . <br>  --  The Seventh Ministry . Municipal Inspection . <br> He passed on through a left-hand door into a long sort of sitting room . There were tables , chairs , and sofas , as well as a large armoire . He opened it . Inside were a great number of identical suits in various sizes . Identical to the suit he himself was wearing . It was an elegant suit , obviously costly , but very quiet . <br>  --  Size ? he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate suit . <br>  --  Your office is this way , he said . <br> We exited the sitting room and proceeded back past Rita , who was now awake and watching us with one of two eyes . I said nothing ; she said nothing . <br>  --  In here , said Levkin . <br> Through the right-hand door we went . A hallway led to the back of the house . There was a ladder on one side and a stair on the other . Levkin climbed up the ladder . I followed . At the top , a landing and a door . He opened the door . <br>  --  Your office . On the desk , a letter in explanation . Rita may or may not be up soon with your tea . <br> Levkin did a sort of half bow , and vanished back through the door and down the ladder , leaving me to survey my new premises . It was a fine room . A very long window ran much of the way along the wall , giving a view out onto the park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chasing the first dog unsuccessfully . I felt that this meant something . I wrote it down on a pad of paper . <br> Dog chasing dog itself chasing dog , but not fast enough . <br> I illustrated the note , took a tack , and pinned it to the wall beside my desk . As I did this , Rita entered and leaned against the wall . <br>  --  Dressing up the place ? she asked . <br>  --  Is that my tea ? I asked . <br>  --  It can be . <br> She crossed the room and set the tea down on a small table by the window . With a sigh she threw herself down into a large leather chair and sat watching me . <br> I shook my head . I picked the suit up , went into the bathroom , and changed into it , slowly and carefully . The experience was enormously pleasing . Never had I been in possession of such a fine suit . It fit perfectly . Pants , shirt , vest . There was even a pocket watch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she said , and held the suit coat up for me . <br> I slid it on . <br>  --  Milk and sugar , I said . Or , just honey . If you 're going to do something , you might as well . . . <br>  --  I 'll write that down somewhere and lose it , she said . The suit fits . Not bad . I imagine you do n't know a thing about what goes on here , do you ? <br>  --  I know enough , I retorted . <br>  --  We 'll see , she said . If you know anything at all , then why do we keep all our clocks three hours ahead ? <br> We went out into the main room . Sure enough , the clock was three hours ahead . <br>  --  Well , that 's obvious enough , I said . But I 'm busy . Do n't you have something to do ? <br>  --  Try figuring out why you have . . . <br> She reached into the sleeve of my suit and pulled a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was monogrammed : S. M. <br>  --  . . . secret pockets in your clothing . Tell me that , buster . <br> She spun around and left out a different door , one on the far side of the room . <br> Only after she was gone did I wonder , how had she climbed the ladder with a cup of tea on a saucer ? Evidently there was more to Rita than met the eye , though what met the eye was just fine . <br> Turning back to the desk I found an envelope . Within there was a letter , two days old . <br> Seventh Ministry 21 July xxxx <br> Mr. Selah Morse , <br> Imagine that you are being written to from a place no larger than a gourd . In this gourd , furthermore , the necessary supplies for writing letters do not exist . Therefore , we make do with other mediums . Or perhaps this business of the gourd is a lie , a simple way of beginning a letter that I had hoped I would never have to write . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been one Municipal Inspector in the city . For there to be two , well , I simply was not prepared for the circumstance to arise . Yet here you are . <br> I have it on good authority from Rita , the message-girl , that you can not be trusted with any task , and that we should despair of your ever becoming a useful member of our little cadre . However , at the time of her saying this , Rita was operating under the clever assumption that you were only an idea and not an actual person . The contrary , rather , is the case . You are an actual person , and the work that you have to accomplish here is merely an idea . <br> Do you understand ? We inspect things . We go about the city and occasionally stir ourselves to inspect virtually anything we choose . Our authority is both unlimited and nonexistent . It operates on a case-by-case basis . On a given day I might have the power to shut down a dam . The next I can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Vaguer and vaguer ! I 'm sure you understand now . After all , you were recommended to us as a sly young man . This you had best prove . <br> Senior Inspector , Seventh Ministry <br> Mars Levkin <br> I set the paper down . By the window I found my tea . It was quite cold . In fact , it looked like someone had been ashing a cigarette in it . <br>  --  That was n't for you to drink , said Rita , opening the door again . <br> She had a tray this time . On the tray was another envelope , and a cup of tea . She brought it over and set it down gently . <br>  --  I 'm Rita the message-girl , she said . <br>  --  I 've been told that , I replied . <br> She adjusted the hem of her skirt . <br>  --  Any messages to send ? she said . <br>  --  Could you tell Levkin that  --  <br>  --  No ! she said . Only written messages . What sort of message girl do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving me with the tea and letter . <br> I took a sip of the tea . Irish Breakfast , with just the right amount of milk and sugar . Thank you , Rita . I opened the letter . <br> Seventh Ministry 21 <br> July xxxx <br> M.I. Selah Morse , <br> I do hope you 're settling in . Things have been dreadfully strange around here ever since Maude ran away ( the gray tabby ) . I think you are quite handsome and pleasant to talk to , and you must n't get the wrong idea about me . I am excited to see if you can do the work , and if you like it . Also , I had a cousin named Selah who died when he was very young . He died right after he learned to read . The doctor said some people are n't meant to read . No one knows if he was joking or not , but we have to assume so . Was it a funny joke ? I have never been in a position to tell . Anyway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seventh Ministry <br> I closed the letter and smiled to myself . On an ordinary day , I would be reading in the park or working on one of my pamphlets in my cramped apartment . Was it true ? Had I really come up in the world ? I inspected my clothing for secret pockets and found several more , including a rather clever one that went all the way down the pant leg , starting beneath a false belt loop . Or , I suppose , the belt loop was a belt loop truthfully . But it also had this other business of being the start of a secret pocket . <br> HOWEVER , the true business began later , and about that we will now speak . <br> Several months , perhaps six or nine , had passed since I had begun work as an inspector . I was quite used to my schedule and to my responsibilities . It was late in the day , when afternoon has begun quite visibly to crumple around the edges and one can smell rather than sense that evening will soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter , when one sees night approaching from afar on spindly noiseless legs . But now it was the spring , and I was heading towards a noodle shop happily situated between a sort of pretend-dadaist gallery and an old movie theater named the Grand Corazon . Whenever I was in that neighborhood I made a point of stopping by the noodle shop . <br> As I walked , a girl came out of a doorway ahead of me and paused in the street . She was very happy , perhaps as happy as a person could be ; one could tell this at a glance . She looked up at the second-story window . It was closed . Presumably she had just come from the apartment to which it belonged . The girl was quite fine-looking , with bare shoulders and a beauty that I have always ascribed to the Han dynasty of ancient China . Not that she was Chinese . No , I did n't know what she was , Slavic maybe , and elegant . <br> Out of nowhere , a taxi came speeding . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl made as though to jump back onto the curb , but instead went the other way , out into the street . With a dreadful thud , the braking taxi smashed full into the girl , sending her flying up into the air to land flat on the pavement some twenty feet away . The whole thing was rather like a geometry problem . Except that one could see immediately how truly injured the girl was , and one ought n't to say such things or even think them at such times . <br> I dropped the brown paper parcel I was carrying and ran to where she lay . One is n't supposed to lift or move people who have been struck by dynamically heavy and fast-moving objects ; however , I could n't help but lift the girl off the street . She was completely unconscious . All her gladness had paused a moment . <br>  --  Driver ! I shouted . <br> Continues ...
