Section : Nation &; World With the Taliban 's collapse , U.S. forces step up the difficult and dangerous hunt for bin Laden . After that , rebuilding a ravaged nation <p> Dateline : WASHINGTON ; NORTHERN AFGHANISTAN ; KABUL ; KANDAHAR ; ; JALALABAD ; ISLAMABAD , PAKISTAN <p> For weeks , the Taliban 's bombast had promised a fight to the death . But when the fall of Kabul came , it was little more than a whimper , and a pretty undignified one at that . In the early morning hours last Tuesday , Taliban pickup trucks loaded with fighters , weapons , and ammunition boxes filled the roads heading south . Some of the troops left the front lines so quickly they apparently abandoned their turbans . In a suddenly deserted and lawless city , armed men with beards and turbans looted the jewelry market and the currency exchange . After two hours of anarchy , two armored vehicles and three tanks from the Northern Alliance forces rolled in . Kabul had fallen . The only shots fired were in small clashes with Pakistani @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed of the Taliban 's collapse was breathtaking . For weeks , despite U.S. bombing , the front lines had barely moved . An ever louder chorus of naysayers disparaged the American war plans . Then , with little warning , everything changed . In under 100 hours , in a series of fierce firefights and negotiated surrenders , the Northern Alliance reclaimed almost half of Afghanistan , as the Taliban mysteriously melted away . Even tribal leaders in the south , who had previously been dormant , suddenly mounted apparently spontaneous revolts . Now it was the Taliban clinging to life and to their remaining scraps of territory . <p> The war , of course , is far from over . Unknown thousands of Taliban fighters remain unaccounted for , many having scattered into remote mountain crevices , some into nearby Pakistan . Afghanistan has a long history of similar movements mounting long and deadly guerrilla campaigns . And despite the apparent death of al Qaeda 's operational mastermind , Mohammed Atef ( box , Page 18 ) , Osama bin Laden and much of his terrorist network remain at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his followers now becomes the primary mission for the several hundred U.S. special operations forces inside Afghanistan . After losing his main patron with the Taliban 's defeat , bin Laden might be easier to track down , especially with a $25 million U.S. bounty on his head . But efforts to form a post-Taliban government have been hampered by the speedy victory , as the gulf between rival opposition groups has deepened . Stability will also depend on how quickly the United States and its allies move to alleviate widespread hunger and help rebuild the ravaged nation . <p> It all began with the fall of the strategic northern city of Mazar-e Sharif on November 9 . From there , the dominoes fell swiftly . Alliance commanders fought their way into neighboring provinces . Boosted by large-scale defections from the Taliban , the alliance retook many towns without a fight . Veteran commander Ismail Khan walked into the western town of Herat nearly unopposed . <p> Any resistance , in fact , was unexpected resistance . When Northern Alliance troops neared the northern town of Konduz , expecting another peaceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a conspicuous hilltop . They were startled by a sudden burst of artillery fire and beat a hasty retreat in their trucks , even running over others in their panic . The Arab and Pakistani fighters holed up in Konduz were apparently still heeding the commands of Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar , who tried to rally his forces in a radio address . " Any person who goes hither and thither is like a slaughtered chicken which falls and dies , " he declared . " You should regroup yourselves , resist and fight . " <p> Fate sealed . In most of the country , his appeal was too little , too late . His once feared fighters were too demoralized . As the Northern Alliance swept through the north , its forces also broke through the front lines near the capital of Kabul . The rebels halted their advance on the outskirts of Kabul as they had promised southern opposition groups composed of Pashtuns , Afghanistan 's largest ethnic group . But when the Taliban abruptly abandoned the city , the Northern Alliance seized the chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was transformed , as items that had been dangerous contraband only the day before  --  televisions , satellite dishes , music , even kites  --  sprouted throughout the city ( story , Page 30 ) . <p> The fall , when it came , was so fast that it had many people wondering if the Taliban was in fact trying to set a deadly trap for Northern Alliance or U.S. forces . After all , this group of hardened , fanatical fighters could n't just have imploded , could it ? They were n't supposed to give up without a serious fight . As it turned out , apart from the Taliban 's dedicated Arab and Pakistani fighters , the loyalty of the regime 's Afghan fighters had been sapped by its years of harsh and ineffective rule . " It seems as if people were just waiting for the chance to throw off the Taliban yoke , " says Julie Sirrs , a former Defense Intelligence Agency analyst on Afghanistan . " Now that it is obvious the Taliban are on their way out , they are willing to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Taliban 's reliance on foreign fighters , suddenly had an alternative movement to latch on to . The same kind of defections that helped build the Taliban also sealed its fate . <p> As it turned out , the Taliban were also hurt worse than most observers realized by an intensified U.S. military effort . The destruction of the Taliban 's communications helped turn a strategic retreat into a panicked one . Heavier U.S. airstrikes on front-line troops were being precisely coordinated by U.S. special forces working on the ground with the Northern Alliance . " As we got our own people into Afghanistan and married up with their leaders , we got better intelligence , " says a senior U.S. official . " You began to see targets you can hit . " Special forces soldiers were even helping to lead cavalry charges against the Taliban , according to military situation reports . " I am advising a man on how to best employ light infantry and horse cavalry in the attack against Taliban T-55 tanks , " wrote one U.S. officer . " They have killed 125 Taliban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the south , meanwhile , other U.S. operatives had made surprising inroads in coordinating efforts with Pashtun tribal leaders . <p> Some U.S. troops became even more directly involved , fighting side by side with the Northern Alliance in a vicious firefight for the city of Konduz . The added prize for them was the unknown number of Arab fighters leading the resistance . Not everything went smoothly , however . An errant missile struck a mosque in the eastern Afghanistan town of Khost on the first day of Ramadan . <p> When it came to fighting the Taliban 's foreign fighters , the Northern Alliance showed little mercy . In the northern city of Mazar-e Sharif , at least 100 Taliban soldiers , believed to be Arabs holed up in a schoolhouse , were reportedly killed after they refused to surrender . In Kabul , dozens of bodies littered the streets after scattered gun battles . " Whoever could not speak Pashtun or Persian was killed on the spot , " claimed Ebad ur-Rehman , a middle-aged Taliban supporter who reached Kandahar after fleeing Kabul . " Whenever they found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Satisfied Afghan refugees made no apologies , recalling the vicious punishments meted out by the Taliban for the most minor violations . One returning Afghan who goes only by the name of Hamhnullah was beaten twice for trading goods across enemy lines . " There was always a lot of beating , " he says . <p> Guerrilla war . The Taliban did put up more of a fight in their spiritual capital of Kandahar , but even there it just seemed to be a matter of time . " They can capture our cities , destroy the bridges and hospitals , but the fight against the Americans will go on from the mountains and the deserts , " Taliban Deputy Foreign Minister Mullah Abdul Jalil told U.S. News in an interview at his office in Kandahar . His threats might be all that 's left for the Taliban  --  Omar reportedly handed over power at the end of the week to other Pashtun leaders in order to head for the hills . But the prospect of a dangerous guerrilla war looms large . U.S. officials are very leery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on U.S. special operations forces or eventual peacekeepers . " In the short term , what you do is go into the mountains and see how the new government performs and try to exploit that , " says a senior Bush administration official . " That 's why it 's important to get a political regime in place . " <p> The first U.S. priority , however , remains eliminating the rest of the Taliban and al Qaeda . And the quick collapse of the Taliban left war planners puzzled about how to attack a foe that has melted into the caves , mountains , and teeming marketplaces of Afghanistan . The hasty retreat " happened so fast that we 're trying to map out what comes next , " explains one defense official . With few valuable targets left to hit , the intense bombing campaign has given way to commando strikes in the south , where special operations forces are patrolling the roads to interdict Taliban forces . U.S. troops on the ground are also calling in target information for precision air attacks on Taliban soldiers fleeing the cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be part of the Taliban , " Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld quipped last week . <p> The Taliban is now operating in only a fraction of Afghanistan , but much of that territory is the country 's harshest terrain . Taliban sources tell U.S. News that the al Qaeda leadership has retreated to the Oruzgan mountains north of Kandahar , where they have prepared hideouts stocked with weapons for a planned guerrilla campaign . " We do not want to give clear targets to U.S. bombers , " a senior Taliban official explains . " Now there will be a one-to-one contest between us and the enemy . " Taliban fighters gained extensive knowledge of the region 's caves and tunnels during the war against the Soviets in the 1980s and were taught guerrilla tactics by U.S. operatives aiding the rebels . " A lot of the things we used to train them against the Soviets , they 're now turning around and using to fight us , " says one Air Force official . The difference , of course , is that the rebels in the 1980s were resupplied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance . The isolated Taliban fighters will have to endure a winter of dwindling resources . <p> Six weeks of intelligence gathering has also given the Pentagon a clearer picture of where the Taliban forces might try to hide . With spy satellites , drone airplanes , and special operations forces on the ground mixing with Pashtun tribes , officials are confident they can target the forces hiding in caves and then strike with laser-guided munitions . " We are tightening the noose , " Gen. Tommy Franks told reporters at the Pentagon last week . " It is a matter of time . " That noose might become tighter should Washington get information out of the senior Taliban officials captured last week . <p> While the bombing campaign seemed to crush much of the Taliban 's resolve , the hardened Arab fighters allied with al Qaeda present a more difficult challenge . Pentagon officials believe that these forces account for the stiff resistance in Kandahar and Konduz , and that their dedication to the cause of jihad will make them fight to the death . " These guys are going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Prof. Charles Norchi , an Afghanistan expert at Sarah Lawrence College and Yale University . " Reason is not a language that 's going to work with these folks . " A senior Pentagon official puts it another way : " They give no quarter ; they expect no quarter . " <p> Well-placed bribe . As for the grand prize of the manhunt , bin Laden , Rumsfeld damped down expectations last week that the United States would soon corner the master terrorist and even suggested that bin Laden could escape over Afghanistan 's porous borders . " It 's not a bottle that you can cork , " Rumsfeld said . " It 's a large country with a lot of borders , and one has to be realistic . " Nevertheless , U.S. officials are hopeful they can turn softening support for the Taliban and al Qaeda into valuable intelligence about the location of the groups ' senior leadership . In Afghanistan , the most powerful weapon is often the well-placed bribe . <p> But U.S. forces will have to act quickly , before the retreating forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pakistanis are sneaking into Pakistan , crossing on foot to avoid stepped-up border patrols . U.S. News has learned that some of the fighters are trying to flee on routes usually used for smuggling opium . U.S. intelligence agencies have previously mapped these paths , and now the military is working to capture them before they cross the border . <p> To keep Afghanistan 's new leaders focused on the fight against al Qaeda , U.S. officials intend to rely on a series of carrots and sticks . But they expect that the interim government will be a loose federation of regional and tribal leaders working under a weak central government in Kabul . The State Department has compiled a list of about a dozen key leaders who will be an essential part of any executive council . <p> To ensure the loyalty of these warlords , Washington will rely mostly on the promise of massive reconstruction funds . U.S. officials are talking about as much as $1 billion a year for a decade in international funds to rebuild Afghanistan . The money would most likely be delivered directly to these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States root out any remaining terrorists . " The international assistance coming in is important because it will overwhelm any kind of small-time bribery that the Taliban or bin Laden can do of tribal leaders , " says Al Santoli , a congressional expert on Afghanistan . " That 's why international assistance is so important . " Failing that , there remains the " big stick " of the military , which could launch commando raids in the backyards of uncooperative warlords . <p> Early signs , however , are not entirely encouraging . Opposition forces are united by only one thing  --  the aim of removing the Taliban . The Northern Alliance appears eager to show the world it is serious about bringing peace to Afghanistan , but acting first and thinking later have left the leadership without a clue about what happens next . Splits within the alliance also appear to be emerging . Ousted Afghan president and nominal alliance leader Burhanuddin Rabbani is eager to reclaim his job . But the new generation of alliance leaders favors the broader-based approach demanded by the West . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government in Kabul , " says alliance Interior Minister Yonus Qanooni . <p> A planned meeting of opposition leaders with a United Nations envoy to discuss a future government was held up after greedy elements of the Northern Alliance became reluctant to attend , apparently flirting with claiming Kabul entirely for themselves . U.S. officials have begun to pressure them into cooperating , explaining that U.S. aid is contingent upon their participation in a broad-based government . " The Northern Alliance is changing its willingness to cooperate with others , " says one Pakistani diplomat , who fears the prospect of an ethnic war between Pashtuns and other Afghans . In fact , provoking such a war may be part of the Taliban 's strategy . To seal the " fall " of the eastern town of Jalalabad , the Taliban invited warlord Yunus Khalis to take over on the condition that he not allow the Northern Alliance to enter . <p> For their part , the Pashtuns resent the Northern Alliance 's unilateral seizure of Kabul and are worried that they will be shortchanged in a future government . Scrambling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders rushed into the country from neighboring Pakistan . Haji Zaman Ghamsharik , one of the country 's most feared Pashtun warlords , rode triumphantly back into his hometown of Jalalabad last week . " The Arabs are nothing now , " he told U.S. News during a risky overland journey punctuated by tense checkpoints and the distant sound of rocket blasts . " They will either starve in the mountains or try to flee . " He was greeted with flowers and celebratory gunfire . The Arabs , he learned , had fled earlier that day , some even handing their weapons to villagers as they boarded boats to head for Pakistan . At week 's end , tribal warlords were meeting to decide who would control military bases and customs posts . <p> Now what ? The dramatic reversal of Taliban fortunes has millions of Afghan refugees now dreaming about returning home , many from semipermanent camps in the region . Some of the camps in Iran are already beginning to empty out . " Soon , all of this will return to dust , " says Amir Sard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , surveying the rugged mud track in northern Afghanistan that has been home to his people for the past two months . " Soon , there will be no one left here . " <p> For many of those returning , a grim reality is beginning to settle in . " Now we have freedom , but not the food for our stomachs , " says Khodial , 37 , a refugee who is trailing the advancing Northern Alliance troops to reach home . " Freedom is better than food , but food is also necessary . " <p> The healthcare system is in ruins , electricity is very rare , and most women have n't been to school in years . " We 're dealing with the same problems we had before , after three years of drought and 20 years of conflict , " says Christopher Stokes , who returned last week to head the Mazar-e Sharif office of the aid group Doctors Without Borders . " Two months was n't really enough to have a major human catastrophe here in Mazar . " Food will be the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jordan , and Bangladesh , are considering sending troops to different parts of the country in ad hoc missions to safeguard food deliveries . British troops landed at an old Northern Alliance air base in Bagram last week to evaluate the runway for possible relief flights . <p> In newly liberated Afghanistan , the markets were reopening and music filled the streets . At the Friday morning prayers marking the beginning of Ramadan , the imam at the largest mosque in Taloqan exulted in the victory , but he also sounded slightly defensive . " Every mullah is not a Taliban , " he told the overflowing crowd of thousands . " The Taliban are not mullahs . They are terrorists . " At the back , two dozen women sat listening . They were wearing burkas , but their mere presence would have prompted a whipping , or worse , only a week earlier . Life , it seems , is beginning to return to normal . <p> MAP : Taliban on the run : Aided by U.S. airstrikes , Northern Alliance forces have swept across more than half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the Taliban in the southeastern part of the country .
