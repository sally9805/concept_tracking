The Galpagos Rift .30 Degrees South , 90.30 Degrees West He was gliding on the edge of the abyss . Below him yawned the watery blackness of a frigid underworld , where the sun had never penetrated , where the only light was the fleeting spark of a bioluminescent creature . Lying prone in the form-fitting body pan of Deep Flight IV , his head cradled in the clear acrylic nose cone , Dr. Stephen D. Ahearn had the exhilarating sensation of soaring , untethered , through the vastness of space . In the beams of his wing lights he saw the gentle and continuous drizzle of organic debris falling from the light-drenched waters far above . They were the corpses of protozoans , drifting down through thousands of feet of water to their final graveyard on the ocean floor . Gliding through that soft rain of debris , he guided Deep Flight along the underwater canyon 's rim , keeping the abyss to his port side , the plateau floor beneath him . Though the sediment was seemingly barren , the evidence of life was everywhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marks of wandering creatures , now safely concealed in their cloak of sediment . He saw evidence of man as well : a rusted length of chain , sinuously draped around a fallen anchor ; a soda pop bottle , half-submerged in ooze . Ghostly remnants from the alien world above . A startling sight suddenly loomed into view . It was like coming across an underwater grove of charred tree trunks . The objects were black-smoker chimneys , twenty-foot tubes formed by dissolved minerals swirling out of cracks in the earth 's crust . With the joysticks , he maneuvered Deep Flight gently starboard , to avoidteart slamming in panic against the body pan . The hull . Have I damaged the hull ? Through the harsh sound of his own breathing , he listened for the groan of steel giving way , for the fatal blast of water . He was thirty-six hundred feet beneath the surface , and over one hundred atmospheres of pressure were squeezing in on all sides like a fist . A breach in the hull , a burst of water , and he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cold sweat soaked his body . He finally managed to speak . " I got startled  --  collided with the canyon wall  --  " " Is there any damage ? " He looked out the dome . " I ca n't tell . I think I bumped against the cliff with the forward sonar unit . " " Can you still maneuver ? " He tried the joysticks , nudging the craft to port . " Yes . Yes . " He released a deep breath . " I think I 'm okay . Something swam right past my dome . Got me rattled . " " Something ? " " It went by so fast ! Just this streak  --  like a snake whipping by . " " Did it look like a fish 's head on an eel 's body ? " " Yes . Yes , that 's what I saw . " " Then it was an eelpout . Thermarces cerberus . " Cerberus , thought Ahearn with a shudder . The three-headed dog guarding the gates of hell . " It 's attracted to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll see more of them as you get closer to the vent . " If you say so . Ahearn knew next to nothing about marine biology . The creatures now drifting past his acrylic head dome were merely objects of curiosity to him , living signposts pointing the way to his goal . With both hands steady at the controls now , he maneuvered Deep Flight IV deeper into the abyss . Two thousand meters . Three thousand . What if he had damaged the hull ? Four thousand meters , the cr ushing pressure of water increasing linearly as he descended . The water was blacker now , colored by plumes of sulfur from the vent below . The wing lights scarcely penetrated that thick mineral suspension . Blinded by the swirls of sediment , he maneuvered out of the sulfur-tinged water , and his visibility improved . He was descending to one side of the hydrothermal vent , out of the plume of magma-heated water , yet the external temperature continued to climb . One hundred twenty degrees Fahrenheit . Another streak of movement slashed across his field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grip on the controls . He saw more eelpouts , like fat snakes hanging head down as though suspended in space . The water spewing from the vent below was rich in heated hydrogen sulfide , a chemical that was toxic and incompatible with life . But even in these black and poisonous waters , life had managed to bloom , in shapes fantastic and beautiful . Attached to the canyon wall were swaying Riftia worms , six feet long , topped with feathery scarlet headdresses . He saw clusters of giant clams , white-shelled , with tongues of velvety red peeking out . And he saw crabs , eerily pale and ghostlike as they scuttled among the crevices . Even with the air-conditioning unit running , he was starting to feel the heat . Six thousand meters . Water temperature one hundred eighty degrees . In the plume itself , heated by boiling magma , the temperatures would be over five hundred degrees . That life could exist even here , in utter darkness , in these poisonous and superheated waters , seemed miraculous . " I 'm at six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see it . " In his earphone , Helen 's voice was faint and crackling . " There 's a sh elf jutting out from the wall . You should see it at around six thousand eighty meters . " " I 'm looking . " " Slow your descent . It 'll come up quickly . " " Six thousand seventy , still looking . It 's like pea soup down here . Maybe I 'm at the wrong position . " " ... sonar readings ... collapsing above you ! " Her frantic message was lost in static . " I did n't copy that . Repeat . " " The canyon wall is giving way ! There 's debris falling toward you . Get out of there ! " The loud pings of rocks hitting the hull made him jam the joysticks forward in panic . A massive shadow plummeted down through the murk just ahead and bounced off a canyon shelf , sending a fresh rain of debris into the abyss . The pings accelerated . Then there was a deafening clang , and the accompanying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head jerked , his jaw slamming into the body pan . He felt himself tilting sideways , heard the sickening groan of metal as the starboard wing scraped over jutting rocks . The sub kept rolling , sediment swirling past the dome in a disorienting cloud . He hit the emergency-weight-drop lever and fumbled with the joysticks , directing the sub to ascend . Deep Flight IV lurched forward , metal screeching against rock , and came to an unexpected halt . He was frozen in place , the sub tilted starboard . Frantically he worked at the joysticks , thrusters at full ahead . No response . He paused , his heart pounding as he struggled to maintain control over his rising panic . Why was n't he moving ? Why was the sub not responding ? He forced himself to scan the two digital display units . Battery power intact . AC unit still functioning . Depth gauge reading , six thousand eighty-two meters . The sediment sl owly cleared , and shapes took form in the beam of his port wing light . Peering straight ahead through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stones and bloodred Riftia worms . He craned his neck sideways to look at his starboard wing . What he saw sent his stomach into a sickening tumble . The wing was tightly wedged between two rocks . He could not move forward . Nor could he move backward . I am trapped in a tomb , nineteen thousand feet under the sea . " ... copy ? Steve , do you copy ? " He heard his own voice , weak with fear : " Ca n't move  --  starboard wing wedged  --  " " ... port-side wing flaps . A little yaw might wiggle you loose . " " I 've tried it . I 've tried everything . I 'm not moving . " There was dead silence over the earphones . Had he lost them ? Had he been cut off ? He thought of the ship far above , the deck gently rolling on the swells . He thought of sunshine . It had been a beautiful sunny day on the surface , birds gliding overhead . The sea a bottomless blue ... Now a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gabriel , the man who had financed the expedition , speaking calmly and in control , as always . " We 're starting rescue procedures , Steve . The other sub is already being lowered . We 'll get you up to the surface as soon as we can . " There was a pause , then : " Can you see anything ? What are your surroundings ? " " I  --  I 'm resting on a shelf just above the vent . " " How much detail can you make out ? " " What ? " " You 're at six thousand eighty-two meters . Right at the depth we were interested in . What about that shelf you 're on ? The rocks ? " I am going to die , and he is asking about the fucking rocks . " Steve , use the strobe . Tell us what you see . " He forced his gaze to the instrument panel and flicked the strobe switch . Bright bursts of light flashed in the murk . He stared at the newly revealed landscape flickering before his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now his attention shifted to the immense field of debris scattered across the shelf floor . The rocks were coal black , like magnesium nodules , but these had jagged edges , like congealed shards of glass . Peering to his right , at the freshly fractured rocks trapping his wing , he suddenly realized what he was looking at . " Helen 's right , " he whispered . " I did n't copy that . " " She was right ! The iridium source  --  I have it in clear view  --  " " You 're fading out . Recommend you ... " Gabriel 's voice broke up into static and went dead . " I did not copy . Repeat , I did not copy ! " said Ahearn . There was no answer . He heard the pounding of his heart , the roar of his own breathing . Slow down , slow down . Using up my oxygen too fast ... Beyond the acrylic dome , life drifted past in a delicate dance through poisonous water . As the minutes stretched to hours , he watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He saw an eyeless crab slowly scuttle across the field of stones . The lights dimmed . The air-conditioning fans abruptly fell silent . The battery was dying . He turned off the strobe light . Only the faint beam of the port wing light was shining now . In a few minutes he would begin to feel the heat of that **25;640;TOOLONG magma-charged water . It would radiate through the hull , would slowly cook him alive in his own sweat . Already he felt a drop trickle from his scalp and slide down his cheek . He kept his gaze focused on that single crab , deli cately prancing its way across the stony shelf . The wing light flickered . And went out .
