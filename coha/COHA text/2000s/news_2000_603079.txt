<p> WALHALLA , N.D.  --  At night , when Immigration and Naturalization Service inspector Jeff Beil closes the border crossing here between Canada and the USA , he plops six orange traffic cones on the road . <p> Those six cones on Highway 32 are the only defense in Walhalla against smuggling , illegal immigrants and terrorism from 10 p.m. until an agent returns at 9 a.m. the next day . <p> " People do go around the cones , " says Beil , who alternates shifts with a Customs agent . " If no one sees them , they probably do n't get caught . " <p> There are few reasons to visit Walhalla , a 1,131-person blip on the map with an unchallenging ski slope and a tiny airport . Yet this patch of prairie , where the international boundary is marked by only a concrete obelisk , is an official port of entry into the United States , one of 111 along the 4,000-mile-long U.S.-Canadian border from Port Angeles , Wash. , to Lubec , Maine . <p> A sign posted on the U.S. Customs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a one-pump gas station , instructs southbound motorists on the two-lane road to check in . <p> If the USA 's border with Mexico is a fortress , the Canadian border is an invisible line . <p> An army of almost 8,000 armed U.S. Border Patrol agents guards the 2,000-mile Mexican border , four agents for each mile . Where the Rio Grande and treacherous terrain fail to thwart illegal crossings , the U.S. government has erected 12-foot-high steel fences . On the USA 's northern frontier , 311 agents try to guard a boundary that meanders through prairies , mountains , vast lakes , woods , national parks and even a public library . <p> Two USA TODAY reporters  --  one an American citizen , one a British citizen  --  traveled along the Canadian-U.S. border for eight days , crossing from one country to the other and back . The goal : to determine just how tight security has become since suspected terrorists were arrested last December while crossing into Washington state and Vermont from Canada . <p> The reporters tested more than a dozen crossings . They found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are searched and relatively few travelers are interrogated . The reporters themselves were stopped and questioned just once  - -  by Canadian officials , not American . <p> Immediately after the arrest of Algerian Ahmed Ressam on Dec. 14 at a ferry dock in Port Angeles , security was stepped up everywhere . Customs Commissioner Raymond Kelly ordered two officers to staff every border station 24 hours a day , seven days a week . Because bomb-building materials were found in the trunk of Ressam 's car , dogs worked overtime to sniff vehicles for traces of explosives . Traffic at major crossings backed up , sometimes for 3 or 4 miles , as inspectors intensified their searches . <p> As quickly as it began , it was over . With funding short and the threat seemingly diminished , border officials eased security back by late January . <p> Some officials remain worried . They say the low-key security  - -  including 42 posts that , as Walhalla does , employ only traffic cones at night  --  leaves the U.S. at an unacceptable risk for terrorism . Gene Davis , formerly the assistant Border Patrol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ border , can be blunt because he retired Jan. 1 : " Bottom line , the northern border is completely open , and to me , it 's very alarming . " <p> The people who use the border know how wide open it is . " If you want to smuggle , you can smuggle anywhere , " says Rick Fostey , who lives in Emerson , Manitoba . " The logistics are impossible . There 's 30 to 40 miles between checkpoints and no fences . I could take you across anytime I wanted . " <p> U.S. Customs has requested money from Congress to pay for 214 new agents and 98 new inspectors . INS wants 430 new Border Patrol agents . But neither agency has determined how many would go to the northern border . <p> " Obviously , there 's vulnerability , " says Kelly , a former police chief of New York City . " The Port Angeles incident was a very serious wake-up call . " <p> Even if the money comes through , it will never be enough to patch every hole in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to upset the nation 's $ 329 billion-a-year trade relationship with Canada , authorities say . <p> Everyone along North Dakota 's border frontier with Canada knows about Thursday night at the Emerson Inn in Emerson , Manitoba , less than a mile from the U.S. line . <p> Big-city strippers imported from Winnipeg gyrate on this bar 's wooden stage in Emerson , a hamlet of 721 people . College guys from Grand Forks drive over the border for fruity cocktails and an eyeful . <p> The drinking age in Canada is 18 . In the USA , it is 21 . So for the minor inconvenience of a 90-mile drive and a few perfunctory questions from the Canadian customs , the American boys can buy themselves a legal night of nudity and beer . <p> In the closest American town , Pembina , N.D. , there 's The Spot , a popular pizza joint . Ernie Kozak , a retired Canadian customs agent , and his wife , Ruth , drive past a little-used border crossing almost daily for a cheap pitcher of beer there . Canadian taxes keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You may cross twice a day sometimes , " Kozak says . " When you 're a local , it 's different . We 're almost like Americans . " <p> The symbiotic relationship between American border towns and their counterparts on the Canadian side depends on an open border . American and Canadian lives are intertwined through commerce , marriage , jobs and plain proximity . <p> Americans in border villages buy groceries in Emerson to wring the most out of a strong U.S. dollar . Shops deal in either currency . Whole American towns buy heating oil from Canada . Elderly Americans delight in the lower prices Canadian pharmacies charge for prescription drugs <p> Nobody on the border wants barbed wire , lengthy interrogations or regular car searches when trying to run a few miles up the road to the most convenient store for a gallon of milk . <p> Tightening the border could trip up the livelihoods and lifestyles of hundreds of thousands of people : <p> * In 1998 , Canadian trade and tourism pumped $ 1.23 billion into Plattsburgh , a New York city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Montreal , though the Canadian metropolis is 50 miles away , says Garry Douglas , president of the Plattsburgh-North Country Chamber of Commerce . Plattsburgh 's public television station draws 80% of its membership from Quebec . <p> * Border-dwelling Vermonters shoot 45 minutes up the highway to shop and dine in Montreal , much closer than major U.S. cities . <p> * Each year , more than 30 million vehicles drive into Detroit from Windsor , Ontario , by way of the Ambassador Bridge or the Windsor-Detroit Tunnel , the two busiest border crossings . Economists say 45% of U.S.-Canada trade goes through the two crossings . Windsor residents flying to U.S. and international destinations use Detroit Metropolitan Airport , a 10-minute drive on a good day . No one wants traffic jams . <p> " It 's like blood flowing through the veins . You want it to be unobstructed , " says Fran Funaro , managing director of the City Center Business Association of Windsor . <p> False alarms <p> Interstate 87 , the artery that pumps people and goods , legal and otherwise , between Montreal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sector 's picturesque maple trees and dairy farms . <p> Border Patrol agent Mark Henry knows the local schoolchildren by name . He needs only to examine the prints in the snow to determine whether a deer or a human has crossed the border . Illegal immigrants crossing from Canada , mostly from India , Pakistan and China , stand out in Swanton . <p> So when a sensor hidden near the highway on the New York side of Lake Champlain sends an alarm to his headquarters in Swanton , Henry spins his Chevy Tahoe around and skids down 10 miles of icy road one moonless night . <p> Henry half-wishes he could turn off his headlights and sneak up on this still theoretical culprit , but he does n't do that . " You want them to come to you , because they could run back across the border with the contraband " if an agent pounces too quickly , he says . <p> After a quarter-century with the U.S. Border Patrol , Henry , Swanton 's assistant chief agent , views the job as a balancing act that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He says an agent has to know when to pounce and when to stand back , whom to trust and whom to interrogate . Sure , he could use more agents and sensors , he says , but patrolling a border this big comes down to instinct and experience . <p> Agents note that Ressam , the biggest catch in a long time on this border , was apprehended because of an agent 's instinct , not because of high-tech gadgets . He piqued the agent 's suspicions when he gave muddled answers to routine questions about his itinerary . That triggered a search of Ressam 's car , in which agents found 118 pounds of urea , used to make fertilizer or explosives ; two 22-ounce jars of nitroglycerin ; and , where the spare tire should have been , four circuit boards connected to Casio watches . <p> Ressam has pleaded innocent to charges of smuggling bomb-making materials and conspiracy to commit terrorism . He is being held in a federal detention center in Seattle . His next court date is July 10 . <p> Few arrests in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of the 1,871 people apprehended by Swanton sector agents were Canadian nationals , most of whom were sent home without penalties . The non-Canadians were detained pending court proceedings to return them to their native countries , grant them asylum or imprison them for smuggling or other criminal acts . A quarter of the total apprehensions were for criminal offenses . <p> Families with young children that cross the border illegally are treated leniently . They 're usually released into the care of community social services on the U.S. side and given a court date , unless they are suspected of crimes more serious than making an illegal border crossing . " We try to keep parents and children together , " Henry says . <p> Sometimes , of course , there are false alarms . On this frigid night , with streets as still as a picture on a Christmas card , it turned out that it was a hunk of falling snow that triggered the alarm . Still , Henry checks because smugglers and illegal aliens travel in all weather . " I 've found them on colder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shrug . <p> Lonely nights <p> On the other side of the country , in the Border Patrol radio room in the Blaine , Wash. , sector , a lone communications officer on the night shift monitors dozens of magnetic , seismic and thermal sensors planted along the border . A belt buckle or a footstep near a sensor makes the computers hum . <p> This high-tech wizardry sometimes goes wasted . Blaine 's 48-agent force is stretched so thin that it often takes more than 45 minutes for a border agent to respond to an active sensor . <p> When the night communications officer leaves to use the bathroom , he must carry a walkie-talkie or risk missing a security breach . " We 're able to respond to less than 50% of the sensor hits , " Davis says . <p> Blaine , the busiest port of entry in the Pacific Northwest , is a difficult district : <p> * At the end of a dead-end road a quarter-mile from the Blaine Border Patrol headquarters in Lynden , Wash. , trampled grass and mud outline a well-worn path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American neighborhood . The path indicates heavy , but unofficial foot traffic . <p> * At Peace Arch Park in Blaine , meant to encourage international mingling , visitors can cross the border at will . When the park closes at dusk , folks are supposed to return to their own sides , but not everyone obeys the rules . <p> Are there spots where there is n't 24-hour coverage ? Carey James , the Blaine sector 's chief Border Patrol agent , smiles but wo n't answer . " There are cases when sensors go off and we do n't have the people to respond , " he says . <p> The sector includes 150 miles of water  --  which officials patrol without a boat . " I have absolutely no doubt that every day drugs and aliens are smuggled in that way , " Davis says.Continued on <p> Busiest northern entry points <p> The 10 busiest U.S. entry points from Canada in fiscal 1999 , based on number of border inspections : Inspections &lt;&gt; ( in millions ) &lt;&gt;Windsor-Detroit Tunnel 16 Ambassador Bridge , Detroit 15.6 Niagara Falls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mich.8.1 Blaine , Wash.5.7 Sault Ste.
