The best way to describe Apple 's iMac G5 , which goes on sale later this month , is to say it looks like an iPod on growth hormones . It 's what you 'd get if you stretched the pocket-size music player until it was 17 in. wide and 2 in. deep , squished a supercomputer into the casing and mounted the whole thing on a metal stand . The resemblance is not coincidental . More people buy iPods than iMacs these days , and Apple admits that this third-generation iMac is its best shot at luring millions of iPod owners further into Mac world  --  and inching up its current 3% share of the Windows-dominated market . <P> Will the strategy work ? Only if those iPod owners open their wallets . The new iMac starts at $1,300 for the smaller model with a 17in. screen and goes up to $1,900 for the 20in. screen . That 's less than its predecessors but a bit more than the $250 to $500 iPods . <P> Still , what you get for that money is quite possibly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than merely aesthetic . Unlike a lot of previous Mac machines , on which you could almost fry an egg , the iMac G5 's beautiful white surface does not get noticeably hot . Nor , at a whisper-quiet 25 decibels , does it make enough noise for most people to hear , let alone those who have been blasting their eardrums with the iPod . <P> Designer Jonathan Ive , who shaped the original iMac and iPod , has gone as minimalist as possible with this machine . There is no separate computer tower or power supply ; everything is contained in the display . CDs and DVDs slot in on the side of the screen . The power button is on the back . The speakers are hidden on the bottom , designed to bounce sound off your desk . Throw in the optional Bluetooth wireless keyboard and mouse , and the whole thing needs only one cable , the power cord . A minor gripe is that those do n't come as standard ; nor does Apple 's wireless Internet card , the Airport . Who would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <P> If Apple 's history is any guide , most computers sold over the next four years will have this clean , all-in-one display look . That history also suggests that very few of them will be iMacs . Apple is notorious for not having the supply to keep up with demand . Indeed , the release of this iMac was delayed by a shortage of the superfast G5 chips . At least iPod owners will have something to listen to while they wait .
