TESTERS ' CHOICE 1 ATOMIC SX:11M $1,298 WITH BINDING ( NOT SHOWN ) Along with the Head i.XRC 1100 SW and the Vlkl Superspeed , the SX:11m is a skiercross model with Carving Expert chops . The addition of magnesium power channels this year makes the ski lighter and more resilient . GRIPES : Too much torque for lighter or less aggressive riders . PROPS : Big turner that 's superstable at X Games speeds . TESTER 'S TAKE : " If you get the hole shot and hang on , there ai n't nobody that will come around you on this ride . " Andi Bither-Malboeuf Test Lengths ( cm ) : 160 , 170 Tip/Waist/Tail ( mm ) : 105/66/96 2 ELAN S 12 FUSION $1,025 WITH BINDING Elan 's new Fusion binding system ( two gliding plates on a metal chassis ) provides such an exceptionally deep flex profile , one tester likened it to riding his full-suspension mountain bike . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radius ( 16 m ) complement an otherwise stable and damp ride . GRIPES : Not as lively as Elan 's Pro GX . PROPS : Nice cruiser with quick response time . TESTER 'S TAKE : " This Elan plays the easiest and sweetest modern jazz notes on groomed snow . " Hilary Webb Test Lengths ( cm ) : 168 , 176 Tip/Waist/Tail ( mm ) : 112/67/100 3 ELAN FUSION PRO GX $1,075 WITH BINDING Like the S 12 , the Pro GX 's tip engages early and aggressively . But because its geometry is more slalom race-inspired ( 66 mm at the waist ) , the Pro GX prefers tight , rapid-fire turns . GRIPES : Strong across-the-hill pull makes fast , large-radius turns difficult . PROPS : Most powerful sticks in the category . TESTER 'S TAKE : " This ski is so eager it pours petrol on your competitive fires . " Mike Britt Test Lengths ( cm ) : 170 , 178 Tip/Waist/Tail ( mm ) : 107/66/95 4 FISCHER WORLDCUP SC $785 If you live to make a lot of turns , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprinter . A powerful tail makes this hypercarver as stable as some cruisers in longer arcs . GRIPES : The shorter length requires lightning reflexes if you bobble . PROPS : It 's the most lively and variable off-the-rack carver in the category . TESTER 'S TAKE : " This ski knows what it 's got and taunts you to pull harder and faster G 's . " Mike Tach Test Lengths ( cm ) : 165 , 170 Tip/Waist/Tail ( mm ) : 118/66/99 5 FISCHER RX8 $695 WITH BINDING The RX8 is identical to Fischer 's Worldcup SC in the waist ( 66 mm ) , but with a more moderate cut and mellower flex , it 's better suited for short and medium benders . GRIPES : Our hardest-hammering testers felt some chatter at top speed . PROPS : Ideal for making slalom-type turns all over the mountain . TESTER 'S TAKE : " Like a fine carbon-fiber road bike ; smooth for the long ride . " Andi Bither-Malboeuf Test Lengths ( cm ) : 165 , 175 Tip/Waist/Tail ( mm ) : 115/66/98 6 HEAD I.XRC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a truly worry-free carver in the bunch , the 1100 is it . The lengths we tested ( 163 and 170 cm ) had oversize sweet spots and plenty of grip . They practically beg to be laid over in long arcs . GRIPES : Too soft tip-to-tail for Tomba-types . PROPS : A user-friendly , race-stock-quality cruiser . TESTER 'S TAKE : " Like a big cobra , just quietly snaking around , attacking when it wants to . " Megan McGrath Test Lengths ( cm ) : 163 , 170 Tip/Waist/Tail ( mm ) : 113/67/99 7 HEAD I.SL CHIP $1,295 WITH BINDING How much Head 's " Intellifibers " actually convert vibrations into electrical impulses that torsionally stiffen the ski may never be settled . But the ski is unquestionably smooth , with an hourglass geometry ( 11-m radius on a 64-mm waist ) that lives to turn . GRIPES : Because it 's so shapely , it can get squirrelly in long arcs . PROPS : A nearly vibration-free ride . TESTER 'S TAKE : " It 's like a Mercedes SL roadstertight and fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Megan McGrath Test Lengths ( cm ) : 165 , 170 Tip/Waist/Tail ( mm ) : 119/64/102 8 NORDICA SPEED MACHINE 14 XB $1,095 WITH BINDING This Speedmachine screams ; only the Vlkl Superspeed scored higher for stability . But , thanks to a unique crossed-plate binding system underfoot , the scream is silenteven the iciest pitches feel tame . GRIPES : With plenty of metal in both ski and plate , you need extra oomph to tighten your turn radius . PROPS : A cruiser you can short-swing . TESTER 'S TAKE : " This dragster has plenty of throttle ; you just have to supply the canister of nitrous . " Mike Britt Test Lengths ( cm ) : 170 , 178 Tip/Waist/Tail ( mm ) : 114/67/100 9 NORDICA SPEED MACHINE 12 XB $925 WITH BINDING Though the 12 has the same dimensions as the 14 , it 's livelier than its overbearing big sister because it lacks Marker 's stabilizing " Piston Control " system . As a result , there 's more pop at the end of the turn . GRIPES : Not as stable at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighter than the 14 , our female testers favored the 12 . TESTER 'S TAKE : " The General Lee of skis ; big engine , big horn , and huge presence . " Mike Tach Test Lengths ( cm ) : 170 , 178 Tip/Waist/Tail ( mm ) : 114/67/100 10 VOLANT GENESIS GOLD $750 Even in the hardest conditions , the Genesis Gold 's midrange geometry and width allow it to stay predictably on track . A steel cap and wood-core construction make for a plush , confidence-inspiring ride . GRIPES : So damp and quiet , it might lull you into a trance . PROPS : Ample power for such a malleable package . TESTER 'S TAKE : " Mr. Gold is the totally electable candidateno background check required . " Scott Lyons Test Lengths ( cm ) : 160 , 170 Tip/Waist/Tail ( mm ) : 106/66/98 11 VLKL SUPERSPORT 6 STAR $1,115 WITH BINDING The addition of a new Marker binding with enhanced damping features means the radical vibrations of last year 's 6 Star have been all but eliminated . It 's much more stable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ski on edge , and you 'll end up on your arse . PROPS : Big speed , big power . TESTER 'S TAKE : " By any measure , this is the most fun you can have on the front side of the hill . " Hilary Webb Test Lengths ( cm ) : 168 , 175 Tip/Waist/Tail ( mm ) : 114/68/99 12 VLKL SUPERSPORT SUPERSPEED $1,115 WITH BINDING To increase stability and power , Vlkl pulled the metal laminates used in its race-stock line and incorporated them into the Superspeed . It worked . This ski received speed and stability scores just shy of super G status . GRIPES : Does n't do short turns . PROPS : Led the pack in long turns and edge grip . TESTER 'S TAKE : " This is your captain speaking . We 'll be at the bottom of the lift well ahead of our scheduled arrival . " Scott Lyons Test Lengths ( cm ) : 168 , 175 Tip/Waist/Tail ( mm ) : 115/70/99 ASK : DR . FLAKE WHAT 'S UP WITH PEOPLE BENDING SKIS IN THE STORE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equivalent of tire-kicking . You can indeed determine a ski 's stiffness by flexing it , but remember : Your arm is n't nearly as strong as a pair of legs , so in-store manipulation will only get you so far .
