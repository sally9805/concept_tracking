// I believe there are now more abandoned farmhouses than occupied ones in Iowa , " says Contributing Editor Randy Florke . Eight years ago , Randy , who now lives and works in New York , paid $16,000 for an 1890s farmhouse near his childhood home in northwest Iowa so he would have a place to stay when visiting his parents . Repairs , modern amenities , and unfussy decorations consisting of local flea-market finds and a few choice items shipped from back East brought the property 's total cost to $40,000 . " It 's incredibly affordable-and incredibly important , " says Randy , who feels this sort of preservation benefits everyone : Instead of sinking into the earth , these third- and fourth-generation farms could one day become third- and fourth-generation vacation homes , filled with new life and new memories .

" It 's typical Midwest , " says Randy , who notes that forgetting to pick something up can be a big inconvenience when distances between farms and stores are so great .

Bottom right : Many of the odds and ends in the raised-panel hutch are artifacts that Randy found buried in a ravine on the property . " Some of them have cracks , " says Randy , " but they 're perfect for display . " Bottom left : The sink was original to the house-although Randy had to hook up the plumbing . A cast-iron woodstove can be used for cooking , but Randy prefers to work with the vintage enamel range in the corner .

To create the bed , Randy turned a metal bed frame around , attached a section of whitewashed picket fence to it as a footboard , and mounted the headboard fence on the wall . The potbellied woodstove- " just the perfect size for the room " - came from a Long Island , New York , junk shop .
