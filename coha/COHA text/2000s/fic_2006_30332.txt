I love youalready , Olivia August 28 , 1998 35,000 feet over Nevada Tina Burns 188 Westborne Park Road Portland , Oregon 97211 Dear Tina , I was sitting at home yesterday ( where else ? ) working on the fourth draft of my suicide note when I got the call . I resented the interruption and nearly did n't answer the phone . I was having a hard time getting the tone right and , as we 've discussed , tone is everything in correspondence . This seems especially true when it comes to your very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now wonder : is a suicide note correspondence ? ) The first draft was too angry , especially toward Michael , whom in fact I do not resent for dumping me . Why would I ? He was doing me a favor , putting me out of my misery , which is what living with him was like . No , the raging anger and hate hate hate were misdirected in this draft ; they were really meant for my former boss , the president of Universal Pictures , Mr. Josh Miller . As you may recall from our previous discussions , this guy is a real asshole . You remember - the one whose lip curls up to the right when he speaks in his irregular British accent , which he ca n't seem to shake since his junior year abroad twenty years ago . Whose pride and joy is not his five-year-old son but his custom-made butter yellow Rolls-Royce . Josh , whose fleshy face resembles a rhino 's - beady wide-set eyes blinking between a mother of a snout , or maybe it 's the personality that makes one think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found down my throat at the company Christmas party ? ( I know , I should have sued him as you advised , but I was afraid of being blacklisted . ) It was Josh Miller - of the Hollywood Miller dynasty-who after three years as my boss still looked at me with a face that said : Who let her in ? Who stuck me on that Babe rip-off Lloyd the Hamster and then fired me the day it tanked , as I repeatedly warned him it would . Clearly , Josh was the true villain in my life story and deserved all the hate in my soon-to-expire heart , not dear Michael . But I could n't give that windbag the satisfaction of knowing he drove me to suicide , could I ? After further analysis , I realized that of course there were other people I deeply deeply hated too . So , yesterday afternoon , as the super pounded the eviction notice into my hollow apartment door , I committed to another draft . Now , I love my mother . We all love our mothers , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But let 's be honest here . You and I both know they destroyed any chances I had in this world . Do n't say " therapy " to me , Tina ; you know Dr. Schteinlegger did his very best for two years before throwing up his professional hands . I know these dear people from whose clueless loins I sprang have everything to do with why I 'm a complete failure , but that sounded so common . Who does n't blame their parents ? That draft was full of cliches and self-pity , and if it 's one thing I 'm not , it 's self-pitying . Finally , the stewardess brings me my goddamn Bloody Mary . She actually said , Drink it slow because this is your last one . I 've had three , big deal . Have I been unruly ? I asked nicely . Her cat-ass lips puckered as she lurched away . ( The indignity of coach . What better proof of my fall from grace ? And now the smell of baking chocolate chip cookies wafts down from first class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've lost .... ) You may be wondering why I had decided to end my life . I got ahead of myself with the suicide note problem . Well , it 's all about majesty , Tina . My career was in the toilet . Hollywood graciously let me , some nobody shiksa from Shawnee Falls , Ohio , into the magic kingdom , and I blew it . Three years at Universal and the only movie I made was a hamster picture that grossed less than we spent on catering . Then I 'm on the street , without a hit or enough friends to dine out on . A script of Don Quixote I 'd optioned with my last ten grand had just been passed on by every studio in town . I had no love , thanks to Michael 's mysterious departure , and what were the chances of my meeting someone truly wonderful and marrying him and conceiving a child before my last egg dropped ? About the same odds of my father winning the Ohio Mega Millions Lotto . So , no family to live for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's more , I 'm not the blonde I used to be . Highlights were n't cutting it ; I needed about three processes every eight weeks or I 'd be found out , and , perhaps the final straw ( pardon the pun ) , a new stubborn pubicky hair had sprouted over the right corner of my mouth , a truly horrendous harbinger of a mustache soon to follow . A mustache ! Things were bleak before that phone call and I do n't think that 's an exaggeration . I do n't think you can say I was being negative here . ( A mustache ! ) Jimmy Stewart had a helluva lot more to live for when he tried to off himself in It 's a Wonderful Life . What 's incredible is that given how utterly pathetic most people 's lives are , more people do n't do it . I 'd kill for a cigarette . When you 're strapped into a twenty-ton tin can miles above the earth , surrounded by stinking humanity , and you 're flying to the scene of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cigarette . Here 's another good reason to die . You ca n't smoke anywhere anymore . The Reign of Virtue is winning , Tina . You watch . You 're going to wake up one day and find they 've taken all the fun out of living . I know what you 're thinking . Sure . Eventually I might have gotten another midlevel , unsatisfying job , and a midlevel , unsatisfying marriage to go with it ; with the help of science , maybe even some midlevel , unsatisfying kids , too , who , when I was a retired and unfulfilled midlevel film executive , would hate me for being neither famous nor a good parent-sure , all this could be mine , but the question is , where was the majesty ? Some people feel it when they make a stock market killing , get a promotion , or see their kid make a touchdown , some when they win an Oscar , run a marathon , and if you 're one of those lucky bastards , you might even feel the majesty one morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land on a sunflower , blah , blah , blah . Knowing myself as well as I do , I knew majesty would not be found in the life that was yawning before me , and that 's when it hit me like one of those embroidered pillows : if you ca n't live a majestic life , die a majestic death . Ideally this would be in the line of nonprofit duty in Africa or India . Gunned down by guerrillas while spooning rice into a starving but gorgeous brown child 's mouth . Or something more ( seemingly ) spontaneous and heroic : after I pulled Steven Spielberg 's drowning child or perhaps a chihuahua out of the flooded Los Angeles River , my body would be swept to sea . That 'd be majestic . Or I could rid the world of some scum-take out some white supremacists , a corrupt cop or pedophile-before turning the handgun on myself . I 'd like to do something noble , but I was feeling too desperate to organize that kind of opportunity . Just killing myself would be simpler and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies reading about my death and feeling real sorry for what they 'd done or not done as the case may be . The only thing stopping me was the note , which is why I was still alive when the phone rang yesterday and changed my plans . Olivia ? It 's your father . He always identifies himself , even after all these years as my father . He was hammered . I nearly hung up on him . Oh , god ... honey ... It 's your sister . He was weeping , too . What ? What happened ? Maddie 's got ... All your life you try to imagine what bad news sounds like , but when you actually hear bad news , it simply makes no sense ; it 's like being told the definition of a black hole by a physicist , directions by a local , the evidence of God by a priest . First you say , What ? Then , after it 's repeated to you- It 's leukemia. - you say : No . Olivia ( Continues ... ) by Elisabeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
