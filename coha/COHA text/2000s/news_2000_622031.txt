<p> I jumped off the train before the pipe smokers took over . The cabin was a haze of pretension ; I could n't think straight . As I tumbled there in the dust , the Purist Express rolled on without me  --  good riddance . <p> Just two weeks ago I was happily on board , decrying the onslaught of home runs and high-scoring games , declaring the whole thing to be " out of control . " Then I began to wonder : Exactly when am I getting angry here ? Not in the stands of the Coliseum or Pacific Bell Park . Not at home in front of the television . Not even when I read the boxscores or game accounts . No , it was only when I sat down to write . Suddenly I felt this tremendous urge to scoff , as if I belonged to some time-honored traditionalist 's clan with a motto like " Tut-tut " or " Harrumph . " <p> By the time I finished speak ing with Leonard Koppett , I was fully cured . Koppett is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Baseball Hall of Fame , but more than all that , he is a source of perspective . He always seems to view things a bit differently , with truth the inevitable reward . <p> So , Leonard , I asked him , are you upset over all these home runs , these 17-16 games ? <p> " No , not at all , " he said . " Why should I be ? " <p> " But it 's 1930 all over again , " I said . <p> " Absolutely , " he said . " Hell of a year . " <p> The point being : We are in the middle of a baseball renaissance , delightfully comparable to Ruthian times , and we are n't even aware of it . <p> Between the 1919 and 1920 seasons , Koppett reminds us , baseball took dramatic steps toward producing a livelier baseball . There was no public acknowledgment of the experiment , nor any explanation of how the deed was done , but its impact was undeniable . Babe Ruth , whose 29 home runs had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And in 1921 , with everyone else still lagging well behind , he cracked 59 . <p> Because of Ruth , and a growing number of sluggers to follow , baseball fit the Roaring ' 20s image as well as any dance band or speakeasy . Numbers skyrocketed over the decade , finally peaking in 1930 , when the National League hit .303 ( you read that right ) , Hack Wilson drove in 191 runs and Bill Terry hit .401 . The great pitchers , names like Lefty Grove , Waite Hoyt , Burleigh Grimes and Dazzy Vance , thrived right along with the hitters . Quite simply , the game was a roaring good time . It had captured the public 's fancy , with more than a half-century of good times ahead . <p> Switch now to the offseason between 1992 and ' 93 . Right then , Koppett claims , the ball was significantly " juiced " again . There had been subtle adjustments before ( including some to deaden the ball slightly ) , but this amounted to a revolt . " Baseball does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show a change that is impossible to ignore , " Koppett said . " Particularly for players who had played many years without hitting home runs . Those players ' power numbers increased dramatically , across the board . That 's when you realized something was up . " <p> By ' 94 , the juiced-ball accusations were running rampant . We remember that season mostly for the ghastly labor crisis that cost us the World Series , but players like Matt Williams , Jeff Bagwell and Ken Griffey Jr . were racking up astonishing numbers that summer . Next thing you knew , the legendary feats of Ruth and Roger Maris were no longer safe . By ' 98 two men were clearing 61 homers , with plenty of room to spare . <p> And the game regained its popularity . Given up for dead in that awful autumn of ' 94 , baseball began drawing fans at a record pace . New ballparks spring up at every turn . The NBA seems downright tedious in comparison . And all because of the renaissance in power hitting . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite comparable to the game 's progression from 1920 to World War II , " Koppett said . " Since when is it boring to see a lot of runs scored , to see teams coming from six runs down to win in the ninth ? The fans love it . People complain that no lead is safe . ' Wonderful ! That 's the best of all possible worlds . " <p> For those of us who spent our high-school weekends watching Mays , Koufax , Gibson and Aaron , acceptance does not come easily . The ' 60s were a time of supreme balance in baseball . There was glory in a 50-homer season , and there were plenty of ERAs under 3.00 . But those days are gone . It 's not 1962 anymore . Wills is n't dropping a bunt single , taking second on a Gilliam sacrifice and scoring on Tommy Davis ' single to center . Everybody 's going deep , and just when you 're certain that every ballgame will be 11-10 by the bottom of the fourth , Randy Johnson goes the distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run  --  and loses to Montreal . Along comes Steve Trachsel to outduel Pedro Martinez , then " El Duque " in a pair of 1-0 thrillers . It 's still a great game , the best game , just as thought-provoking and unpredictable as ever . <p> None of this means , however , that the game 's officials should just sit back and enjoy the fireworks . Some adjustments should be made  --  not out of panic , merely a sense of right vs. wrong . Let 's examine the many components of the offensive revolution , with a few suggestions along the way . <p>  --  The Mound : There is growing sentiment among the general managers , including the Giants ' Brian Sabean , to raise the mound  --  probably by four inches , from 10 to 14 . Today 's pitchers face a long list of obstacles , from the DH to the shrinking strike zone to the suit of armor worn by some players to ease the pain of getting hit . This would be a welcome change , giving pitchers a bit more slope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a more downward trajectory and gain a mental edge in confidence . Some feel the more pronounced angle might even reduce arm stress and curtail the number of shoulder injuries . <p>  --  The Baseball : The Rawlings people keep insisting that the baseball has n't changed , in any form , over the past 15 years . They are n't very convincing . Who do you believe , some executive on the Major League Baseball payroll or guys like Dave Righetti , Mike Krukow or Rick Sutcliffe , who adamantly claim that the ball is wound tighter these days ? Bottom line : In the 1980s and all years prior , you could " rub up " the ball and actually adjust the skin a little bit . You could literally " knock the stitches off it " ( remember that phrase ? ) with a good rip . <p> None of that happens today . The ball might as well be a Titleist 3 . Loosen up that thing ; maybe flatten the seams a little . The big boys will stay on their search-and-destroy mission , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposite field . <p>  --  The Ballparks : To anyone disturbed by the trend toward hitter-friendly new ballparks , wise up . These are charming , wonderful places with intimate designs , quirky features and dark green seats . They are made strictly for baseball , and they are guaranteed to improve attendance ( at least for the short haul ) in every city . Some of the parks , like Pac Bell and Detroit 's Comerica Park , are actually fair by traditional standards . The only problem is that so many hideous venues  --  like the Metrodome , Pro Player Stadium , Olympic Stadium , Tropicana Field , Veterans Stadium and Cinergy Field  --  still exist . <p>  --  The Drugstore : Do n't let anyone mislead you . The game is full of users . A lot of knowledgeable sources say you would n't believe the percentage of players who use anabolic steroids , and substances like creatine and androstenedione  --  still perfectly legal in baseball  --  are as common in clubhouses as chewing gum . Before , players popped amphetamines to get up for the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball and become chick magnets in the hotel lobby . <p> So far , baseball 's response has been to look the other way . As irresponsible as that may be , it is n't such a bad answer . Bulking up does n't help a player 's game in the slightest . It does n't improve his swing or make him more proficient at bunting , hitting the cutoff man or judging a flyball . It simply makes him hit the ball a little farther when he does make contact . <p> Baseball does n't want to become track and field , which has become a gigantic forum for suspicion , accusations and drug busts . What 's the worst thing that could happen ? A few more home runs . Besides , the users will pay the price . Oh , you bet they will . There is growing evidence that " andro " and similar substances produce elevated testosterone and ( gasp ) estrogen levels . And the consequences of steroid use are already well known . <p> So go ahead guys , bulk right up . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can show us your acne , your uncontrollable twitching and your irritable manner . Maybe you 'll be like some of those track and football studs who begin to take on female characteristics . <p>  --  To Expand and Contract : Expansion is just another word for the three-run homer . Every time the game expands , you can add truckloads of pitchers with a 7.88 ERA . There is n't one good thing about expansion , and never has been . To hear sources tell it , some of the owners are deadly serious about contraction  --  actually buying out franchises and wiping them off the map . <p> Surely it wo n't happen ; sounds too crazy . But think how the quality would improve . Imagine eliminating all those jokers who do n't belong in the big leagues . If you 're going to do this , do it right ; reduce the number of teams from 30 to 24 , and all of the fine symmetry it represents . Let 's see , we 'll knock off Florida , Tampa Bay , Montreal , Minnesota , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask baseball , Oakland would be the sixth team . Never mind . Just kidding . <p>  --  The DH : Houston manager Larry Dierker put it best the other day : " We made a big mistake coming in with the DH , and now we ca n't get rid of it . If they 'd waited a few years , everything would have taken care of itself . " For certain , the DH has outlived its purpose , which was to increase scoring . I 've read volumes of pro-DH propaganda and every argument , right down to the last phrase , has been complete nonsense . Let the game develop naturally . Let the pitchers hit . Let them face up to the payback when they go head-hunting . The game will improve in every way . <p>  --  The Strike Zone : Sandy Alderson and Ralph Nelson , the MLB executives in charge of umpiring , promise some radical changes once the new union ( the World Umpires Association ) signs a long-term labor contract . Good . This is the perfect time , a fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell the umps to call strikes as they are designated in the rulebook : from the letters to just below the kneecap . It 's not a big puzzle : Call the damn strikes . None of this blather about " high-strike " umps or " he 's a low-strike guy . " What 's to lose ? What 's the point in squeezing pitchers out of their rightful territory ? The games will move faster and some balance will be restored . In the new world order , call strikes or you 're fired . <p> I 'd like to think that most fans , despite their issues with modern-day baseball , realize that the game has not been destroyed . For those still grousing and mumbling , remember this : After all of the 3-and-0 counts , 37-hit ballgames , cheap home runs and absurd roller-coaster rides last season , it came down to the New York Yankees , the team with the best pitching and defense . A team that simply played the game , as it was meant to be played , better than anyone else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be that way . <p> CHART : FANS DIG LONG BALL Average Year HR's/game attendance/game 1919 0.400 5,842 1930 1.268 8,223 1968 1.228 14,668 1992 1.443 26,978 1993 1.776 31,337 1994-(a) 2.066 31,612 1995-(a) 2.023 25,260 1996 2.189 26,889 1997 2.048 28,288 1998 2.082 29,285 1999 2.277 29,152 2000-(b) 2.623 29,655 .
