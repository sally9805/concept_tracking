HOW DID YOU END UP IN GHENT ? " Monique asked . Joseph watched her hand wave like a handkerchief through the smoke circling around the cramped caf and then pointed to her coffee saucer . " Could I have that sugar if you 're not going to use it ? " " You ca n't tell me ? What is it , some big secret ? " she said , as she pushed the packet across the table . Joseph smiled . He liked how curious she was about everything : what he ate , where he slept , how he cut his hair , how he survived the winter cold . When they first met , he had been wary , afraid she might be mocking him like his brothers , who had harassed him for his toys and laughed at his odd piggish face and told him he was too ugly to come from their tribe . Their questions still taunted him in his head : " Why are you squinting at that book , Joseph ? " " What are you dreaming about now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much for him to remain self-conscious with her . In her monochrome clothes the color of earth and stone , she was a reverse image of the women he had grown up with . Skin as white as his was black , so pale he could see the bluish veins crisscrossing on her wrists ; stringy hair like straw ; and instead of taut ebony skin stretched over high smooth bones , her face caved in on itself with barely a chin or a jaw , just thin lips that looked like rind without any juice left , and doughy cheeks that sagged a little like dumplings . Yet even though she was not beautiful , she was a marvel to him : the way she focused her attention on a difficult problem , or asked the professor a razor sharp question that no one else was smart enough to ask . And outside of class she spoke with an awkward nervousness he had known before only in himself . He tore the corner off the packet and twirled the triangle into a tight white thread . " A train brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She shook her head skeptically ; the flat ends of her hair flared out in a circle . He frowned at her and then turned to look out the window to the row of gray apartments across the wet street . They had known each other-how long ? - five , six weeks since the winter term had started , and had talked in lab twice ; and she still could not speak the name of his country ; he was only a continent to her . He wanted her to say , " All the way from Ghana ? All the way from Bimbilla ? " When he had written to his mother , he told her , " I have met Monique Julien , from Antwerp , Belgium . " Not " a fellow engineering student " or " my future girlfriend " or " the woman I will ask to be my wife " - the last a wild prediction formed one night when he could not sleep after he had dreamed of the two of them walking with their coffee-colored children around the lip of the fountain in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ echoed like a child , a habit he saw might irritate him someday . " A train , " he said firmly , hoping she would leave it at that . The frayed cuff of his long underwear wormed out of his shirt sleeve as he slowly stirred the sugar in his coffee , and then he brought his other hand over the warm drift of steam rising from the cup . A dull song began to throb out of the caf speakers , and suddenly he missed the beat of the music back home drumming in his blood . " You just hopped on a train and it brought you all the way here , over the sea ? " " No , not that kind of train , " he said . He looked out at the apartment block and saw irregular ovals of dampness staining the faade like dark clouds on the paler stone , and along the bottom , a line of leafless saplings growing in the concrete sidewalk , each with its own perfect circle of dirt . A bus sprayed through the remains of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glimpse of a familiar advertisement on the bus , a picture of a group of suited businessmen , briefcases in hand , stepping onto the Eurostar to cross the channel . Somehow he had to make Monique understand who he was , how he had been transported here to this moment and this place . Not Joseph from Africa , but Joseph Solanga from Bimbilla , Ghana , the last , runty son of the family , his mother 's pet and only hope after the other six sons had squirmed free of her missionary school dreams . He saw himself again as a studious , unsmiling boy with a big pea-shaped head filled with diagrams and sketches on another sullen day . But it had been hot and muggy with the moisture sagging in the air , thick enough to hold the spiders Ezra claimed could cross the yard without a web . Ghost spiders , Moses called them , trying to frighten Joseph . He remembered how stiff and scratchy his new shirt was that his mother had made from a piece of bright blue andikra cloth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but his mother had insisted , and when his brothers saw it , they threatened to sell him to the slave traders that supposedly still worked the river . He could not tell whether they were joking , and on the long walk to the main road in the village he did not dare leave his mother 's side . The yellow white pupil of the sun stared down at them , beaming heat into the afternoon air , and Joseph wished his father had not been away working in the mines so he could have ridden on his shoulders . By the time they reached the road , most of the village was already waiting to see Mr. Sarbah 's coffin go by . There was not a stir of wind , except for the drafts the older women made fanning themselves with wing-flapped hands . Then cotton plumes began to mass above the savannah , and worried murmurs passed down the line that a downpour might ruin the parade . The stories were carried along , too ; how Fatu Dendo , the best carver in the region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick Mr. Sarbah had been before he had recovered , and how the coffin would have to be displayed in the front yard because it was too wide to fit through the double front doors and too long for the covered porch . Joseph remained next to his mother in a patch of women and fiddled with the truck he had made out of two Fanta bottle caps and a bit of wire , while the other children played jokes with each other and scuffed up the red powdered dirt . Samuel and Zebulon came back to pester him for the truck . " Come on , old man , " they teased him with the nickname he hated . But Joseph pretended he had left the truck at home and would not move from his protected spot , shielded in the drape of his mother 's skirt . Samuel came back again . " Come on , I know you have it . " He kept his eyes on Joseph , hoping to see a flicker of admission . " No I do n't , leave me alone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take a gulp of air . Samuel gave him a soft punch on the arm . " Next time I 'll hit you harder . " " Make your own truck , " Joseph said . " It 's bad luck to bring a truck to the parade . Mr. Sarbah 's death is going to come to you instead . " " I told you , I left it at home . " The drums were pounding in the distance , signaling that the coffin was on its way , and he knew if he could just hold on a little bit longer , Samuel would get distracted . " Hand it over or else I 'll come back with Ezra and Isaac to hold you down , " Samuel whispered in his ear , pressing his knuckles on Joseph 's hip bone . " If you cry , I 'll make sure you do n't eat for a week . " Joseph debated through the pain . He could easily make another truck , but it was n't right for Samuel to take what was n't his . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , give it to me , " Samuel said , making his tone sound friendly . " I wo n't bother you anymore . I promise . " Joseph pushed closer into his mother , and her palm stroked the fuzz on his head with a preoccupied attention . Then the booming beat of the drummers became louder , pulsing and pounding through the air , and in a predictable flash Samuel turned to follow the noise . His mother craned her long neck and announced that the coffin was coming . Joseph released his grasp from the metal scoring his palm and slipped the truck into his pocket with a deep breath . Then the crowd started to squeeze in around him , and he fought for his footing in the throbbing current of the line ; but his mother knotted her hand around his fist like the end of a rope , and with a small bounce of her arm she tested the snugness of the bond . The pungent scent of a sweat-drenched shirt rubbed past his cheek , and he caught sight of two toga-clad elders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crescendo of praise fluttered up from the crowd : Oh yes , oh my , yes he did it , can you believe it , look at that , oh what a sight . On the other side of the road , Joseph saw the older men roll their shoulders and the young men begin to strut dance steps in their row . The women started to sway and raise their arms , and the throng pressed so tight that for a moment he thought he would be kneaded and folded into the mass of clammy flesh . Then he was squirted out like a fish escaping from a pair of hands , first his head , then his skinny chest and legs , and then his mother 's hand let his arm go free in the crush , and he stumbled into the road . He stood stunned at the shiny disc coming toward him . " Get out of the way , " a servant hauling a rope yelled to him . Joseph stared at the face of a train gleaming in the sun , shimmering in its glossy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steam pipe , the glint of the flanged grill supporting the engine nose that chugged along with the groans of servants who pulled the wagon underneath it . " Watch out , boy ! " He stood bolted in place . The only impulse he felt was to lift up his arms and embrace the amazing coffin that had been birthed from the mind of Fatu Dendo . Around him , the villagers swarmed into the road toward the train like bees to a queen , swelling up and then quickly falling back , careful not to touch the coffin and die . But Joseph did not care . The coffin train bore down , but still he did not move . He opened his eyes as wide as they would go , bunching up the skin on his forehead . He wanted his eyes to take over his face and merge into one big eye to capture this vision and bring it into his own mind in one simple gulp like a snake swallowing a monkey . Then someone jerked him back to the line . His mother 's hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pleasure . Slow flies lit on his lips and forehead , but he was afraid to brush them off and miss a precious second of the train growing bigger and grander in front of him , like banana leaves unfurling in the rainy season , a magical instantaneous growth-except this was n't a living creature . It was the vision of a man manufactured into length and height and volume , and the thought made Joseph 's jaw go slack . The objects Joseph dreamed in his head were no larger than the palm of his hand ; he had not imagined it possible to contain something as huge as a real car or a bus in his head . But Fatu Dendo , so old and hobbled that his skin was shrinking on his skull , had managed to conceive of something so much bigger than himself , and then , in a greater miracle , translated it into the squares and rectangles and circles and joined them together with rods and bars . Joseph watched as the long rectangle of one car went by , and then another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curlicues coiling on the emerald green frame . At the end came the neat square of a maroon caboose but no one wanted to give up their place alongside the coffin train , and the crowd shambled along . " All aboard , " Moses shouted with a mischievous smile as he walked down the line . A nervous laugh went up from the crowd . " All aboard , " Moses shouted again , looking at Joseph and daring him with a nod . Joseph did n't need any more encouragement . He wriggled his fingers to free them from his mother 's hand . She adjusted her grip ; he wriggled more insistently . If she had not released him , he would have torn his fingers off ; but she opened her hand and he slipped out , his legs pumping up and down like the pistons as he sprinted on the ragged edge of grass fringing the road ready to follow the train as far as he could . " I was only joking , " Moses shouted after him . Someone yelled at him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seam of his shirt , but he yanked it free and pushed on . " You ca n't ! " " Where 's his mother ? " He heard his mother shout back in triumph , " He knows it 's just a superstition . " The crowd gasped at her audacious claim , and then a woman screamed as he grasped the rail and hoisted himself into the passenger car where the coffin bed had been placed . For a moment he held his breath , his heart thumping against his chest , and he looked out at the crowd . Ahead , the clouds slipped over the sun . Some of the people sniffed the air and a few stepped back to claim the shelter of a tree . " You are going to die ! " He knew the voice before he saw his oldest brother , Solomon , come alongside as close as he could without touching the coffin train , his face twisted up with fear . Then Solomon turned to the crowd . " He is going to die , " he repeated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he were winding them up . Others took up the chant , accusation and prediction and terror all wrapped up in one awful note , chugging like a train : He is going to die , he is going to die . But Joseph saw his mother , her long proud neck rising high , smiling at him , and he was not afraid . He knew he was not going to die ; he was free . Then a sudden gust rattled through the scrub , and before there was time to take another breath , the sky became a spout of gushing water . People scattered to the trees , and the servants dropped the ropes and went for the tarps tucked under the wagons . Joseph huddled in the padded box , smelling the tang of varnish and paint , and hoped no one would remember him . Then there was a whoosh as a tarp was thrown over the car , shutting out the light . But in the darkness he could still see the vision burning in his head , the driving wheels carved with petaled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose and fell as the train moved on , the coupling that joined one car to the next . He lay in the stuffy air , dreaming of a hundred cars winding through the village into the scrub . The rain lightened , and he could hear voices under the wagon . " Have you thought how big a hole we 'll have to dig to cover this beast ? " " How did it ever get so huge ? " " You did n't hear ? Fatu Dendo told Mr. Sarbah if he was going to carve a train , he wanted to be sure it was just like the real ones Mr. Sarbah had ridden on in Europe , and he had Mr. Sarbah fly him there so he could see for himself " Joseph startled . Not from Fatu Dendo 's head , but someone else 's , in a different country ? He felt a bitterness in his stomach . His mother was right . He did n't belong in this village with its unfinished concrete huts and contented men resting in the shade . The voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only think of how he could get to the place where machines had been birthed . He wondered where Europe was . Perhaps it would be too far to walk and he would have to take a real train . The rain stopped thumping , and the tarp was pulled off ; but Joseph lay there for a moment more , seeing himself jump on the very last car of a train picking up speed out of a station , and he began to travel far away from his brothers , farther than he could see , into an unknown world . If he had thought about it then , he could have predicted what would happen a few minutes later when he climbed down from the train . The entire village shunned him . His brothers stopped talking to him , his teacher refused to have him in the class , the other children ran away when he walked down the lane , and he lived in happy silence for an entire year . But he would never have been able to imagine the miracle that happened when Mr. Sarbah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the rich man was so proud of the folly his magnificent coffin had provoked , he pledged to pay for Joseph 's entire education , first sending him to the mission school in Kumasi , then to high school in Accra . After he died , his son took over and arranged for Joseph to go to university , and Joseph had flown on a plane to this cold , ancient city of arched bridges and train yards with tracks spreading out like fingers and neatly squared curbs and old brick sidewalks and church steeples so high they were sometimes lost in the clouds , and now he was sitting in a smoky caf across from a pale woman who had opened up another whole future in his head . Monique had taken out the day 's assignment , and he watched her work on it , concentrating so hard her teeth bit into her colorless lips , and he wondered what they would taste like if he kissed her . The music was still drumming through the caf , joined by the sound of laughter from a group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and asked Joseph for the empty chair at their table , and Joseph pushed it toward him , then went back to staring at Monique . Suddenly she closed her notebook and stuffed it into her bag hanging over the back of her chair . He watched helplessly as she went over and took her coat off the hook on the wall . " You have to go ? " he asked when she came back for her bag . Something was wrong . She looked sour , mean even . " I ca n't study here . I 'm going to my place . " He hurried after her . " I 'll walk you there . " She shrugged and tilted her head to a funny angle . " If you want . " Out in the street the drizzle had started again . She took out an umbrella and popped it open , but he took it from her hands and held it over her as they walked , not caring that the rain soaked his face and jacket . " You 're getting wet . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not lift her eyes from the pavement . " It 's OK . " By the time they reached her apartment , he could feel his socks soggy in his squeaky shoes , and the front of his pants were thick and stuck to his thighs . He looked up at the building , trying to memorize the bland features , and finally saw two bright stripes from orange curtains hanging in one of the upper story windows . " Will you have coffee with me again ? " " I do n't know . " She looked down as she said it , pursing her lips together until they almost disappeared completely . He thought he should have kissed her in the caf right after she had taken a sip of hot coffee , but he remembered she did not put any sugar in hers and he winced for a moment , then decided it would n't have mattered . " Can I have my umbrella ? " The tiny pale blue marbles of her eyes were growing smaller now , closing down , contracting against the world , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back but did n't know how . She unlocked the heavy glass door and swung it open , then it began to close sluggishly behind her with a loud pneumatic sigh . She had already started up the stairs when he caught the door and stuck his head inside the foyer . " Monique , Monique . " She stopped and leaned against the banister , as if she were too tired to stand up , and when she looked down at him , he saw something strange flicker across her face . For a moment he did not speak while he looked at her and tried to understand what her face was saying . Was she dismissing him ? Did she think he was not good enough for her ? Then she tilted her head and with a finger she very slowly brushed the matted hair away from her face , as if she did n't want him to notice . With that tentative gesture it came to him : She thought he was teasing her . Oh no , she had it wrong , all wrong . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will tell you everything , " he pleaded . " Please , tomorrow-can we meet tomorrow ? You 'll see . " He felt his heart pounding in his chest and held his breath to shield himself from the blow of her refusal , but he saw relief relax her face . OK , " she said , but she did not look at him , and then he realized how shy she was , how gentle he would have to be . Even though she had already turned around , he lifted his pink palm in a little wave . " Until tomorrow then . " Behind him the rain began to patter harder and louder on the cement , like a train gathering steam . He smiled and closed his eyes to listen for a moment , and then without waiting for the storm to weaken , he left the shelter of the doorway and started down the walk . Author Affiliation A. H.
