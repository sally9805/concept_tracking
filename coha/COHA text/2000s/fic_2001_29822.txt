STORYBOOK HOUSE We were the Mulvaneys , remember us ? You may have thought our family was larger , often I 'd meet people who believed we Mulvaneys were a virtual clan , but in fact there were only six of us : my dad who was Michael John Mulvaney , Sr. , my mom Corinne , my brothers Mike Jr . and Patrick and my sister Marianne , and meJudd . From summer 1955 to spring 1980 when my dad and mom were forced to sell the property there were Mulvaneys at High Point Farm , on the High Point Road seven miles north and east of the small city of Mt . Ephraim in upstate New York , in the Chautauqua Valley approximately seventy miles south of Lake Ontario . High Point Farm was a well-known property in the Valley , in time to be designated a historical landmark , and " Mulvaney " was a well-known name . For a long time you envied us , then you pitied us . For a long time you admired us , then you thought Good ! that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " my mother would say , wringing her hands in discomfort . But I believe in uttering the truth , even if it hurts . Particularly if it hurts . For all of my childhood as a Mulvaney I was the baby of the family . To be the baby of such a family is to know you 're the last little caboose of a long roaring train . They loved me so , when they paid any attention to me at all , I was like a creature dazed and blinded by intense , searing light that might suddenly switch off and leave me indarkness . I could n't seem to figure out who I was , if I had an actual name or many names , all of them affectionate and many of them teasing , like " Dimple , " " Pretty Boy " or , alternately , " Sourpuss , " or " Ranger " my favorite . I was " Baby " or " Baby-face " much of the time while growing up . " Judd " was a name associated with a certain measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children were rarely scolded and even more rarely punished ; " Judson Andrew " which is my baptismal name was a name of such dignity and aspiration I never came to feel it could be mine , only something borrowed like a Hallowe'en mask . You 'd get the impression , at least I did , that " Judd " who was " Baby " almost did n't make it . Getting born , I mean . The train had pulled out , the caboose was being rushed to the track . Not that Corinne Mulvaney was so very old when I was bornshe was only thirty-three . Which certainly is n't " old " by today 's standards . I was born in 1963 , that year Dad used to say , with a grim shake of his head , a sick-at-heart look in his eyes , " tore history in two " for Americans . What worried me was I 'd come along so belatedly , everyone else was here except me ! A complete Mulvaney family without Judd . Always it seemed , hard as I tried I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , secrets , jokestheir memories . What is a family , after all , except memories ? haphazard and precious as the contents of a catchall drawer in the kitchen ( called the " junk drawer " in our household , for good reason ) . My handicap , I gradually realized , was that by the time I got around to being born , my brother Mike was already ten years old and for children that 's equivalent to another generation . Where 's Baby ? who 's got Baby ? the cry would commence , and whoever was nearest would scoop me up and off we 'd go . A scramble of dogs barking , their eagerness to be taken along to wherever a mimicry of my own , exaggerated as animals are often exaggerations of human beings , emotions so rawly exposed . Who 's got Baby ? Do n't forget Baby ! The dogs , cats , horses , even the cars and pickups Dad and Mom drove before I was born , those big flashy-sexy Fifties modelsall these I would pore over in Mom 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memories . Sure , I remember ! Sure , I was there ! Mike 's first pony Crackerjack who was a sorrel with sand-colored markings . Our setter Foxy as a puppy . The time Dad ran the tractor into a ditch . The time Mom threw corncobs to scare away strange dogs she believed were threatening the chickens and the dogs turned out to be a black bear and two cubs . The time Dad invited 150 people to Mulvaney 's Fourth of July cookout assuming that only about half would show up , and everyone showed upand a few more . The time a somewhat disreputable friend of Dad 's flew over to High Point Farm from an airport in Marsena in a canary-yellow Piper Cub and landed " Crash-landed , almost , " Mom would say drylyin one of the pastures , and though the baby in the snapshots commemorating this occasion would have to have been my sister Marianne , in July 1960 , I was able to convince myself Yes I was there , I remember . I do ! And when in subsequent years they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind buffeted the little plane when Wally Parks , my Dad 's friend , took Dad up for a brief flight , I was positive I 'd been there , I could recall how excited I was , how excited we all were , Mike , Patrick , Marianne and me , and of course Mom , watching as the Piper Cub rose higher and higher shuddering in the wind , grew smaller and smaller with distance until it was no larger than a sparrow hawk , high above the Valley , looking as if a single strong gust of wind could bring it down . And Mom prayed aloud , " God , bring those lunatics back alive and I 'll never complain about anything again , I promise ! Amen . " I 'd swear even now , I 'd been there . For the Mulvaneys were a family in which everything that happened to them was precious and everything that was precious was stored in memory and everyone had a history . Which is why many of you envied us , I think . Before the events of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again put together in quite the same way . We Mulvaneys would have died for one another , but we had secrets from one another just the same . We still do . I 'm an adult telling you these things : Judd Mulvaney , thirty years old . Editor in chief of the Chautauqua Falls Journal , a twice-weekly publication , circulation 25,600 . I 've been a newspaperman or in any case working for newspapers since the age of sixteen and though I love my work and am , I suppose , fairly obsessed by it , I 'm not ambitious in any worldly sense . I 've been entrusted by the elderly gentleman publisher of the Journal , who happens to be a friend of mine , to put out a " good , decent , truth-telling paper " and that 's what I 've been doing and will continue to do . Moving out and up to better-paying jobs in larger cities evokes only the mildest glimmer of interest in me . I 'm not a newspaperman who strives for sensation , controversy . I 'd rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've constructed a personality that is even and temperate and on the whole wonderfully civilized . People murmur to Corinne Mulvaney , after they 've met me , " What a nice young man ! " and , if they 're women like her , women of her age with grown and far-flung children , " Are n't you lucky , to have such a son ! " In fact I suppose Mom is lucky , not just because she " has " me but because she " has " my brothers and sister too , and we love her as much or nearly as much as she loves us . Mom does n't know and I hope never will know that two of her sons were involved in a criminal action of extreme seriousness . I 'll be direct with you : I 've been an accomplice to two Class-A felonies punishable by lengthy prison terms in New York State and I came close to being an accessory both before and after the fact in an actual case of murder and very possibly I would not be repentant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patrick , who came close to committing the murder , would not have been repentant . Asked by the judge to speak on his own behalf , at the time of sentencing , Patrick would have looked the man in the eye and said , " Your Honor , I did what I did and I do n't regret it . " Many times in my imagination I 've heard Patrick say these words . So many times , I almost think , in that twilight state of consciousness between sleep and wakefulness , which involves a subtle , shifting , mysterious personality few of us have explored , that in fact Patrick was arrested , tried , and convicted for murder , kidnapping , auto theftwhatever the numerous charges would have beenand had stood before a judge and spoke in just this way . Then I force myself awake , and relief floods through me like sunshine ! It did n't happen , not in that way . But this document is n't a confession . Not at all . I 've come to think of it as a family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth-telling . The kind no one 's mom keeps . But if you 've been a child in any family you 've been keeping such an album in memory and conjecture and yearning , and it 's a life 's work , it may be the great and only work of your life . * * * I 've said there were six in our family but that 's misleading . Six is such a small number ! In fact High Point Farm was busy and complicated and to a child confusing as a stage play in which familiar and unfamiliar faces are ceaselessly coming and going . Friends , relatives , houseguests , Dad 's business contacts , hired helpevery day and frequently every hour you could count on it that something was happening . Both my parents were sociable , popular people who had little patience with quiet , let alone solitude . And we lived on a farm . We owned horses , dairy cows , goats , a few sheep , chickens and guinea fowl and geese and semi-tame mallard ducks . What a barnyard squawking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew up with such sounds , and the cries of wild birds ( mainly jays who nested close about the house in our giant oaks ) , I came to believe they were part of the very fabric of morning itself . The very fabric of my soul . Unlike neighboring farms in the Valley , High Point Farm was n't any longer a " real " farm . Dad 's income came from Mulvaney Roofing , in Mt . Ephraim . Originally , the farm property had included three hundred acres of good , fertile if hilly soil , but by the time Dad and Mom bought it , only twenty-three acres remained ; and of these , Dad leased fifteen to neighboring farmers to grow timothy , wheat , soybeans , alfalfa , corn . But we had farm animals we loved , and of course we had dogs , rarely less than four , and catscats ! always a select number of cats allowed inside the house and an ever-shifting number of barn cats . My earliest memories were of animals with personalities stronger than my own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlike , for instance , a dog ; a cat can be virtually anything . Dad used to complain jokingly that the boss of the household was a certain temperamental , supremely self-absorbed and very beautiful Persian cat named Snowball and the second-in-command was Mom , of course , and after that he did n't care to speculate , it was too humbling . " Oh , yes ! We all feel sorry for poor Curly , do n't we ? " Mom teased affectionately , as Dad made a brooding face . " So neglected in his own home ! " Say I counted the animals and fowl of High Point Farm with personalities defined enough to have been namedhow many might there have been ? Twenty ? Twenty-five ? Thirty ? More ? And of course they were always shifting , changing . A new litter of puppies , a new litter of kittens . Spring lambs , goats . It was rare that a foal was born but when a foal was born , after many days and nights of worry ( mainly on Mom 's part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mare ) it was quite an occasion . Several families of canaries had come and gone before I was born and it was a fond household tale of the time Mom had tried to breed canaries right there in the kitchen , the problem being she 'd succeeded only too well , and at the height of the " canary epidemic " as Dad called it there were three large cages containing a total of fifteen canaries , trilling , warbling , chirping , scolding , sometimes screeching " And ceaselessly defecating , " as Dad said dryly . I remember once when I was very small , Dad brought home a spindly-legged little gray goat because its owner , a neighboring farmer , had been going to shoot it " Come meet Billy-boy ! " Dad announced . Another time , Mom and Mike returned from a trip to the feed store in Eagleton Corners with a large flamey-feathered golden-eyed strutting bantam cock " Everybody come meet Cap'n Marvel ! " Mom announced . My first puppy was a bulldog named Little Boots with whom I would grow up like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we were the Mulvaneys of High Point Farm , I think of the sprawling , overgrown and somewhat jungly farm itself , blurred at the edges as in a dream where our ever-collapsing barbed wire fences trailed off into scrubby , hilly , uncultivated land . ( On a farm , you have to repair fences continually , or should . ) Getting us into focus requires effort , like getting a dream into focus and keeping it there . One of those haunting tantalizing dreams that seem so vivid , so real , until you look closely , try to seeand they begin to fade , like smoke . Let 's drive out to High Point Farm ! Come with me , I 'll take you there . From Route 58 , the Yewville Pike , a good two- and three-lane country highway linking Rochester , Yewville and Mt . Ephraim on a straight north-south axis , you pass through the crossroads town of Lebanon , continue for eight miles following the Yewville River and crossing the erector-set new bridge at Mt . Ephraim . ( Population 19,500 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , passing the aged redbrick mill factories on the river ( manufacturers of ladies ' handbags , sweaters , footwear ) that have the melancholy look of shutdown businesses but are in fact operating , to a degree . Take a right onto Seneca Street past the stately-ugly old Greek Revival building that is the Mt . Ephraim Public Library with the wrought-iron fence in front . Past the Mt . Ephraim Police Headquarters . The Veterans of Foreign Wars . The Odd Fellows . Bear right at the square , where most of the tall old elms have been removed , and continue on to Fifth Street , where you take a right at Trinity Episcopal Church . Nowait . This route is a shortcut to avoid Mt . Ephraim 's " downtown " ( hardly more than three blocks but the old , narrow streets can get congested ) . Let 's circle around to the far end of South Main Street , another right , and a left , now we 're in an area of small businesses and warehouses . There 's Mulvaney Roofinga smallish single-storey stucco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trim . On the roof are state-of-the-art asphalt-and-polyester shingles in a slightly darker shade of green . How proud Dad was of Mulvaney Roofing . How hard he 'd worked for it , and to build up his reputation as a man you not only wanted to do business with because his product was so fine but because you liked and respected him as a damned nice guy . Now back onto Fifth , and continue for three blocks . Passing on the left Mt . Ephraim High where we Mulvaney children all went to school , in turn ( factory-style design , flat leaky roof and cheap bargain bricks built in the mid-Sixties and already showing signs of wear ) and the school playing fields and at the corner a town ballpark , nothing spectacular , a few bleachers and a weedy infield and litter drifting in the wind like tumbleweed . There 's Rose &; Chubby 's Diner , there 's the Four Corners Tavern with the cinder parking lot . Past Depot Street . Past Railroad . Down the long hill past Drummond 's Gloves , Inc.still operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Drummond was an acquaintance of my dad 's , we 'd hear of the poor man 's problems at mealtimes . ) Bear right at the fork in the road past Apostles of Christ Tabernacle , one of Mom 's first churches in the area but back before Judd was born , a sad cinder-block building with a movie house marquee and bright pink letters REJOICE ALL , CHRIST IS RISEN ! Continue across the train tracks and past the Chautauqua &; Buffalo freight yards . You 'll see the water tower fifty feet above the ground on what I 'd always think were " spider legs " : MT . EPHRAIM in rainwashed white letters . ( Probably there are Day-Glo scrawls , initials and graffiti on the water tower , too . Probably CLASS OF ' 76 MT.E.H.S . There 's an ongoing struggle between local officials who want the tower clear of graffiti and local high school kids determined to mark it as their own . ) Turn now onto Route 119 , the Haggartsville Road , a fast-moving state highway . Gulf station on the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast-food drive-through restaurants like Wendy 's , McDonald 's , Kentucky Fried Chicken all recently built along this strip in the early 1970 's . Spohr 's Lumber , Hendrick Motors , Inc . Familiar names because the owners were friends of my dad 's , fellow members of the Mt . Ephraim Chamber of Commerce , the Odd Fellows , the Mt . Ephraim Country Club . The traffic light ahead marks the town limits . Beyond , on the left , is Country Club Lane that leads back from the busy highway for miles in an upscale " exclusive " residential neighborhood ; the Mt . Ephraim Country Club itself is n't visible from the highway but you can see the rolling green golf course , a finger of artificial lake glittering like broken glass . On the right is a similiar prestige housing development , Hillside Estates . Now you 're out of town and the speed limit is fifty-five miles an hour but everyone is going faster . Heavy trucks , semis . Local pickups . You 're passing small farms , open fields as the highway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for several miles then veer off through a tunnel that looks as if it 's been drilled through solid rock . Beyond a scattering of shantylike houses and a sad-looking trailer village there 's a narrow blacktop road forking off to the right : High Point Road . Now you 're in the foothills of the Chautauqua Mountains and those are the mountains in the distance ahead : wooded slopes that look carved , floating . Mt . Cataract is the highest at 2,300 feet above sea level , chalky at its peak , visible on clear days though it 's thirty miles away . It looks like a hand does n't it ? Marianne used to say like someone waving to us . In winter this is a region of snow vast and deep and drifting as the tundra . In my mind 's eye I not only see but cringe at the blinding dazzling white hills stretching for miles , tufted and puckered with broken cornstalks . Sparrow hawks circling overhead in lazy-looking spirals , wide-winged hawks so sharp of eye they can spot tiny rodents scurrying from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a rocket to seize their prey in their talons and rise with it again . In warm weather most of the fields are tilled , planted . Hilly pastureland broken by brooks and narrow meandering creeks . Herds of Holsteins grazing ; sometimes horses , sheep . You 're in the deep country now , and still ascending . Past the crossroads town of Eagleton Cornerspost office and general store in the same squat little building , farm supply store , gas station , white clapboard Methodist church . Now the character of High Point Road changes : the blacktop becomes gravel and dirt , hardly more than a single lane , virtually no shoulders and a deep ditch on the right . The road rides the edge of an ancient glacier ridge , one of a number of bizarre raised striations in the earth in this part of New York State , like giant claws many miles long . And now there 's a creek rushing beside the road , Alder Creek that 's deep , fast-moving , treacherous as a river . Still you 're ascending , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a good idea to shift into second gear . When the road levels , you pass the Pfenning farm on the right , which borders the Mulvaney propertyat last ! The Pfennings ' house is a typical farmhouse of the region , economical asphalt siding , a shingled roof exuding slow rot . The barn is in better repair , which is typical too . Lloyd Pfenning is Dad 's major renter , leasing twelve acres from him most years to plant in oats and corn . A half mile farther and you pass the run-down , converted schoolhouse , Chautauqua County District #9 , where a succession of families have lived ; in this year 1976 , the family is called Zimmerman . Another half mile and you see , on the left , a large handsome black mailbox with the silver figure of a rearing horse on its side and the name MULVANEY in lipstick-red reflector letters . Across from the mailbox there 's a driveway nearly obscured from view by trees and shrubs , and the sign Mom painted herself , so proudly HIGH POINT FARM 1849 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Around the house are five enormous oaks and I mean enormousthe tallest is easily three times the height of the house and the house is three storeys . In summer everything is overgrown , you have to stare up the drive to see the housewhat a house ! In winter , the lavender house seems to float in midair , buoyant and magical as a house in a child 's storybook . And that antique sleigh in the front yard , looking as if the horse had just trotted away to leave the lone passenger behind a human figure , a tenderly comical scarecrow wearing old clothes of Dad 's . A storybook house , you 're thinking , yes ? Must be , storybook people live there . High Point Farm had been a local landmark long before my parents bought and partly restored it , of course . Most recently it had been the secluded homestead of an eccentric German-born gentleman farmer who 'd died in 1951 and left it to young , distant relatives living in cities far away with little interest in the property except as an occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I was thirteen , High Point Farm was looking almost prosperous and it was n't unusual for photographers from as far away as Rochester and Buffalo to come out to photograph it , " historic " house and outbuildings , horses grazing in pastures , antique sleigh and " quaint " little brook winding through the front yard . Each year , High Point Farm was featured on calendars printed by local merchants , the Mt . Ephraim Patriot-Ledger , the Western New York Historical Society . On the wall of my office at the newspaper there 's a Historical Society calendar for 1975 , opened permanently to October " Pumpkin Time at High Point Farm ! " A glossy picture of the scarecrow figure in the sleigh in Dad 's old red-plaid jacket , earflap cap , bunchy khaki trousers , surrounded by Day-Glo orange pumpkins of varying sizes including , on the ground , an enormous misshapen pumpkin that must have weighed more than one hundred pounds . Beyond the figure in the sleigh is the lavender-and-fieldstone farmhouse with its numerous windows and steep-pitched roofs . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faded and tattered . Our house was a rambling old farmhouse of seven bedrooms , verandas and porches and odd little turrets and towers and three tall fieldstone chimneys . Dad said of the house that it had no style , it was styles , a quick history of American architecture . Evidence showed that as many as six builders had worked on it , renovating , expanding , removing , just since 1930 . Dad kept the exterior in Al condition , of courseespecially the roofs that were covered in prime-quality slate of a beautiful plum hue , and drained with seamless aluminum gutters and downspouts . The old , central part of the house was fieldstone and stucco ; later sections were made of wood . When I was very little , in the mid-Sixties it must have been , Dad and two of his Mulvaney Roofing men and Mike Jr . and Patrick repainted the wood sections , transforming them from gunmetal gray to lavender with shutters the rich dark purple of fresh eggplant . The big front door was painted cream . ( Eighteen gallons of oil-base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and weeks of work . What a team effort ! I 'd wished I was big enough to use a brush , to climb up onto the scaffolding and help . And maybe in my imagination I 've come to believe I had been part of the team . ) Part of the house 's historic interest lay in the fact that it had been a " safe house " in the Underground Railroad , which came into operation after the passage in 1850 of the Fugitive Slave Act , one of the most shameful legislative measures in American history . My mother was thrilled to discover documents in the Chautauqua County Historical Society archive pertaining to these activities , and wrote a series of pieces for the Mt . Ephraim Patriot-Ledger on the subject . How innocently vain she was ! How captivated , as she said , by " living in a place of history " ! She 'd been born on a small farm about fifteen miles to the south where farm life was work , work , work and the seasons simply repeated themselves forever , never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was after I started school that Mom became seriously interested in antiques . She 'd furnished much of the house with authentic period items , those she could afford , and it became her notion to buy and sell . She acquired some merchandise , set up shop in a small converted barn just behind the house , advertised in one or another local antique publications and painted a sign to prop up beside the scarecrow in the sleigh HIGH POINT ANTIQUES BARGAINS &; BEAUTY ! Not that many customers ever came . High Point Farm was too far from town , too difficult to locate . Sunday drivers might drop by , enthralled by the sight of the lavender-and-stone house atop the hill , but most of Mom 's visitors were fellow dealers like herself . If in fact someone wanted to buy an item of which she 'd grown especially fond , Mom would seem to panic , and murmur some feeble apology " Oh , I 'm so sorry ! I forgotthat item has been requisitioned by a previous customer . " Blushing and wringing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Your mother 's weakness as a businesswoman is pretty simple : she 's a hopeless amateur . " Scouring auctions , flea markets , garage and rummage sales in the Chautauqua Valley , not above browsing through landfill dumps and outright trash , about which Dad teased her mercilessly , Mom only brought home things she fell in love with ; and , naturally , things she 'd fallen in love with she could n't bear to sell to strangers . What is truth ? Pontius Pilate 's question . And how mysteriously Jesus answered himEvery one that is of the truth heareth my voice . Once I thought I understood this exchange but no longer . In setting forth this story of the Mulvaneys , of whom I happen to be the youngest son , yet , I hope , a neutral observer , at least one whose emotions have been scoured and exorcised with time , I want to set down what is truth . Everything recorded here happened and it 's my task to suggest how , and why ; why what might seem to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a loving father , like something in a Grimm fairy taleis n't implausible or inexplicable from within . I will include as many " facts " as I can assemble , and the rest is conjecture , imagined but not invented . Much is based upon memory and conversations with family members about things I had not experienced firsthand nor could possibly know except in the way of the heart . As Dad used to say , in that way of his that embarrassed us , it was so direct , you had to respond immediately and dared not even glance away " We Mulvaneys are joined at the heart . "
