Get inspired by a retreat on the bay that explodes with seasonal spirit and coastal charm . // In the dreaming days , Colene and Carl Joiner 's weekend getaway was a wooded lot where they sat in white plastic armchairs ( which were chained to a tree ) , drank wine , and admired their spectacular view . Now that they 've built the house , the seating is a little better-Adirondack chairs , sturdy rocking chairs-and the dream is reality , but the view is the same . The Joiners see clearly a future of fun-filled family celebrations and quiet evenings by the bay . An Easterly Wind Several years ago , the Joiners purchased a lot in Kemah , a town on Galveston Bay about an hour from their yearround home in Kingwood , Texas , a suburb of Houston . During the months before they started building their house , the couple frequently sat in the " yard " to plan the vacation retreat . Inspired by the casual beauty of Maine , Vermont , and Massachusetts , where they vacation , Carl and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and expertise-he is an architect ; she is an interior designerthey created a home that has a Nantucket-casual feel . Island Ideas White cedar shingles were shipped in from Massachusetts for the home 's exterior . The Joiners had the shingles painted taupe rather than let them weather to the silvery gray color seen along the East Coast . " That 's a real nono . We would be run out of Nantucket for that , " Colene says , laughing . " But long-term , I prefer paint . " At a Nantucket antiques shop , the couple found weather vanes they liked . They custom ordered a copper whale weather vane for the garage roof from the artisan in Connecticut . A hand-carved personalized ship sign , made by Nantucket woodcarvers , hangs above the front door . Nautical Notions Inside , the seaside theme continues with a vibrant color on the walls of the kitchen and combination living-and-dining room .

More water-worthy touches : weathered buoys , starfish , and shells on tables and shelves and a lighthouse area rug in the sunroom . Family Vacation The Joiners ' seven grandchildren are big fans of this home . On the Fourth of July , the family decorates the too-cute golf cart and drives to the boardwalk for the annual parade . After sunset , they have a great vantage point to watch fireworks exploding over the bay . Even without the grandchildren there , Carl and Colene find plenty of ways to play . " We love to tootle around in our golf cart , " Colene says . " We can go within five minutes of the house to six or seven restaurants and find a lot of activity . " In the evening , the couple often heads to the Adirondack chairs by the water for a light show that is no less beautiful than fireworks .
