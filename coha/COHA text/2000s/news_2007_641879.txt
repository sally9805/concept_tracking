<p> ' NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN ' Rating 4 out of 4 <p> Sheriff Bell Tommy Lee Jones <p> Llewelyn Moss Josh Brolin <p> Anton Chigurh Javier Bardem <p> Carson Wells Woody Harrelson <p> Carla Jean Moss Kelly Macdonald <p> Loretta Bell Tess Harper <p> Man Stephen Root <p> Miramax Films presents a film written and directed by Ethan Coen and Joel Coen . Based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy . Running time : 123 minutes . Rated R ( for strong graphic violence and language ) . Opening today at Landmark Century , AMC River East and Century Evanston . <p> - - - <p> The movie opens with the flat , confiding voice of Tommy Lee Jones . He describes a teenage killer he once sent to the chair . The boy had killed his 14-year-old girlfriend . The papers described it as a crime of passion , " but he tolt me there were n't nothin ' passionate about it . Said he 'd been fixin ' to kill someone for as long as he could remember . Said if I let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Said he was goin ' to hell . Reckoned he 'd be there in about 15 minutes . " <p> These words sounded verbatim to me from No Country for Old Men , the novel by Cormac McCarthy , but I find they are not quite . And their impact has been improved upon in the delivery . When I get the DVD of this film , I will listen to that stretch of narration several times ; Jones delivers it with a vocal precision and contained emotion that is extraordinary , and it sets up the entire film , which regards a completely evil man with wonderment , as if astonished that such a merciless creature could exist . <p> The man is named Anton Chigurh . No , I do n't know how his last name is pronounced . Like many of the words McCarthy uses , particularly in his masterpiece Suttree , I think it is employed like an architectural detail : The point is not how it sounds or what it means , but the brushstroke it adds to the sentence . Chigurh ( Javier Bardem ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair and a terrifying smile , who travels through Texas carrying a tank of compressed air and killing people with a cattle stungun . It propels a cylinder into their heads and whips it back again . <p> Chigurh is one strand in the twisted plot . Ed Tom Bell , the sheriff played by Jones , is another . The third major player is Llewelyn Moss ( Josh Brolin ) , a poor man who lives with his wife in a house trailer , and one day , while hunting , comes across a drug deal gone wrong in the desert . Vehicles range in a circle like an old wagon train . Everyone on the scene is dead . They even shot the dog . In the back of one pickup are neatly stacked bags of drugs . Llewelyn realizes one thing is missing : the money . He finds it in a briefcase next to a man who made it as far as a shade tree before dying . <p> The plot will involve Moss attempting to make this $2 million his own , Chigurh trying to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chigurh 's ruthless murder trail . We will also meet Moss ' childlike wife , Carla Jean ( Kelly Macdonald ) ; a cocky bounty hunter named Carson Wells ( Woody Harrelson ) ; the businessman ( Stephen Root ) who hires Carson to track the money after investing in the drug deal , and a series of hotel and store clerks who are unlucky enough to meet Chigurh . <p> " No Country for Old Men " is as good a film as the Coen brothers , Joel and Ethan , have ever made , and they made " Fargo . " It involves elements of the thriller and the chase but is essentially a character study , an examination of how its people meet and deal with a man so bad , cruel and unfeeling that there is simply no comprehending him . Chigurh is so evil , he is almost funny sometimes . " He has his principles , " says the bounty hunter , who has knowledge of him . <p> Consider another scene in which the dialogue is as good as any you will hear this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of wilderness and begins to play a word game with the old man ( Gene Jones ) behind the cash register , who becomes very nervous . It is clear they are talking about whether Chigurh will kill him . Chigurh has by no means made up his mind . Without explaining why , he asks the man to call the flip of a coin . Listen to what they say , how they say it , how they imply the stakes . Listen to their timing . You want to applaud the writing , which comes from the Coen brothers , out of McCarthy . <p> The $2 million turns out to be easier to obtain than to keep . Moss tries hiding in obscure hotels . Scenes are meticulously constructed in which each man knows the other is nearby . Moss can run but he ca n't hide . Chigurh always tracks him down . There seems to be a hole in the plot around here somewhere . Skip the next paragraph to avoid a spoiler . <p> Yes , the money briefcase has a transponder in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the men in the drug deal all killed one another , and the man who unknowingly carried the transponder died under the tree , how did Chigurh come into the picture ? I think it 's because he set up the deal , planned to buy the drugs with the " invested " $2 million , end up with the drugs and get the money back . That the actual dealers all killed one another in the desert and the money ended in the hands of a stranger was not his plan . That theory makes sense , or it would , if Chigurh were not so peculiar ; it is hard to imagine him negotiating such a deal . " Do you have any idea , " Carson Wells asks him , " how crazy you really are ? " <p> Read safely again . This movie is a masterful evocation of time , place , character , moral choices , immoral certainties , human nature and fate . It is also , in the photography by Roger Deakins , the editing by the Coens and the music by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As it does with the Judge , the hairless exterminator in McCarthy 's Blood Meridian ( Ridley Scott 's next film ) , and as in Suttree , especially in the scene where the riverbank caves in , it demonstrates how pitiful ordinary human feelings are in the face of implacable injustice . It also loves some of its characters , and pities them , and has an ear for dialogue not as it is spoken but as it is dreamed .
