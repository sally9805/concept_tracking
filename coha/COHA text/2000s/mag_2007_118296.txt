HOW DID Blades of Glory and Talladega Nights star Will Ferrell end up in yet another sports comedy ? Not long ago he was asked by a friend if he had read Loose Balls , Terry Pluto 's often-riotous oral history of the old American Basketball Association , the league that introduced Dr. J and the red-white-and-blue ball to the world during its nine-year run . Ferrell responded , " Yes ! I want to make that movie ! But would I get to grow my hair out ? " Before long an ABA-inspired script was being written  --  one that called for the star to grow a ' fro . Jokes Ferrell , " That 's when I was sold . " // The film , called Semi-Pro , is in production and will be released next year . SI recently visited the set in L.A. and saw Ferrell letting his hair down  --  and out , and up  --  as a ' 70s R&amp;B one-hit wonder ( the song is called Love Me Sexy ) named Jackie Moon , who uses his newfound wealth to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mich. , and install himself as coach , starting power forward and occasional halftime entertainer . // THE SUPPORTING PLAYERS Semi-Pro is loaded with former NBA players ( Pooh Richardson ) , streetball stars ( the Professor from And1 ) and ABA legends ( George Gervin , Artis Gilmore ) . Outkast rapper Andr ? Benjamin plays Clarence ( Coffee ) Black , a well-traveled shooting guard with a Marbury-sized ego who changes his moniker as often as he changes teams . ( He even swaps squads in the middle of a game . ) And Woody Harrelson plays Ed Monix , an aging former Celtics point guard who was acquired in a trade for a washing machine . But do n't let that fool you . Fifteen years after White Men Ca n't Jump , Harrelson 's moves remain strong . " Woody 's still got it , " says Ferrell . " But he never stops dribbling . Sometimes it 's like , Cooooome on ! " // THE LEAGUE To keep things realistic , rookie director Kent Alterman brought in ABA historian Arthur Hundhausen , who helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tropics ' home arena . Among the authentic ABA touches : retro uniforms for the players and bikinis for the cheerleaders . Alterman also hired sports coordinator Mark Ellis ( The Longest Yard , Coach Carter ) , who spent four weeks teaching the cast to play ABA-style run-and-gun ball . ( Of the semi-flabby Ferrell , Ellis says , " He would not thrive in a fast-break offense. " ) // THE DIRECTOR The 50-year-old Alterman , who was a Spurs season-ticket holder before the ABA merged with the NBA in 1976 , added a few personal touches . Says Alterman , " Back then I was 14  --  a total class clown . Whatever you yelled at the HemisFair Arena , everyone could hear because it was so empty . So I 'd pick a player and get under his skin . Nothing I 'm too proud of . Now in the movie we have these nerdy wheelchair kids with megaphones . Those are a little bit of me. " // THE GRIND Alterman insisted that his players look the part of ' 70s hoopsters from head to toe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which meant there were plenty of aching ankles . " Period shoes  --  sheesh , " says Ellis . " You have no idea what kind of trouble that is . These are 35- to 40-year-old guys . We have two trainers icing every day , all day . " Among the training-room regulars is Ferrell , who had to stop playing in his regular pickup game to avoid additional duress . " Some of the guys say they have n't had it this rough even when they played in a league , " Ferrell says . " I 'm doing everything I can just to keep from falling apart . "
