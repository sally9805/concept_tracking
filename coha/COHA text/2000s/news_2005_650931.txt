<p> THERE were no weapons of mass destruction . There was no collaboration between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda on 9/11 . There was scant Pentagon planning for securing the peace should bad stuff happen after America invaded . Why , exactly , did we go to war in Iraq ? <p> " It still is n't possible to be sure  --  and this remains the most remarkable thing about the Iraq war , " writes the New Yorker journalist George Packer , a disenchanted liberal supporter of the invasion , in his essential new book , " The Assassins ' Gate : America in Iraq . " Even a former Bush administration State Department official who was present at the war 's creation , Richard Haass , tells Mr. Packer that he expects to go to his grave " not knowing the answer . " <p> Maybe . But the leak investigation now reaching its climax in Washington continues to offer big clues . We do n't yet know whether Lewis ( Scooter ) Libby or Karl Rove has committed a crime , but the more we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player like Joseph Wilson , the more we learn about the real secret they wanted to protect : the " why " of the war . <p> To piece that story together , you have to follow each man 's history before the invasion of Iraq  --  before anyone had ever heard of Valerie Plame Wilson , let alone leaked her identity as a C.I.A . officer . It is not an accident that Mr. Libby 's and Mr. Rove 's very different trajectories  --  one of a Washington policy intellectual , the other of a Texas political operative  --  would collide before Patrick Fitzgerald 's grand jury . They are very different men who play very different White House roles , but they are bound together now by the sordid shared past that the Wilson affair has exposed . <p> In Mr. Rove 's case , let 's go back to January 2002 . By then the post-9/11 war in Afghanistan had succeeded in its mission to overthrow the Taliban and had done so with minimal American casualties . In a triumphalist speech to the Republican National Committee , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war on terror was the path to victory for that November 's midterm elections . Candidates " can go to the country on this issue , " he said , because voters " trust the Republican Party to do a better job of protecting and strengthening America 's military might and thereby protecting America . " It was an early taste of the rhetoric that would be used habitually to smear any war critics as unpatriotic . <p> But there were unspoken impediments to Mr. Rove 's plan that he certainly knew about : Afghanistan was slipping off the radar screen of American voters , and the president 's most grandiose objective , to capture Osama bin Laden " dead or alive , " had not been achieved . How do you run on a war if the war looks as if it 's shifting into neutral and the No.1 evildoer has escaped ? <p> Hardly had Mr. Rove given his speech than polls started to register the first erosion of the initial near-universal endorsement of the administration 's response to 9/11 . A USA Today/CNN/Gallup survey in March 2002 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war on terror at the six-month anniversary of the attacks , support for an expanded , long-term war had fallen to 52 percent . <p> Then came a rapid barrage of unhelpful news for a political campaign founded on supposed Republican superiority in protecting America : the first report ( in The Washington Post ) that the Bush administration had lost Bin Laden 's trail in Tora Bora in December 2001 by not committing ground troops to hunt him down ; the first indications that intelligence about Bin Laden 's desire to hijack airplanes barely clouded President Bush 's August 2001 Crawford vacation ; the public accusations by an F.B.I . whistle-blower , Coleen Rowley , that higher-ups had repeatedly shackled Minneapolis agents investigating the so-called 20th hijacker , Zacarias Moussaoui , in the days before 9/11 . <p> These revelations took their toll . By Memorial Day 2002 , a USA Today poll found that just 4 out of 10 Americans believed that the United States was winning the war on terror , a steep drop from the roughly two-thirds holding that conviction in January . Mr. Rove could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might not nail election victories without a jolt of shock and awe . It was a propitious moment to wag the dog . <p> Enter Scooter , stage right . As James Mann details in his definitive group biography of the Bush war cabinet , " Rise of the Vulcans , " Mr. Libby had been joined at the hip with Dick Cheney and Paul Wolfowitz since their service in the Defense Department of the Bush 41 administration , where they conceived the neoconservative manifesto for the buildup and exercise of unilateral American military power after the cold war . Well before Bush 43 took office , they had become fixated on Iraq , though for reasons having much to do with their ideas about realigning the states in the Middle East and little or nothing to do with the stateless terrorism of Al Qaeda . Mr. Bush had specifically disdained such interventionism when running against Al Gore , but he embraced the cause once in office . While others might have had cavils  --  American military commanders testified before Congress about their already overtaxed troops and equipment in March 2002 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to serve as the political Viagra Mr. Rove needed for the election year . <p> But here , too , was an impediment : there had to be that " why " for the invasion , the very why that today can seem so elusive that Mr. Packer calls Iraq " the ' Rashomon ' of wars . " Abstract ( and highly debatable ) neocon notions of marching to Baghdad to make the Middle East safe for democracy ( and more secure for Israel and uninterrupted oil production ) would never fly with American voters as a trigger for war or convince them that such a war was relevant to the fight against those who attacked us on 9/11 . And though Americans knew Saddam was a despot and mass murderer , that in itself was also insufficient to ignite a popular groundswell for regime change . Polls in the summer of 2002 showed steadily declining support among Americans for going to war in Iraq , especially if we were to go it alone . <p> For Mr. Rove and Mr. Bush to get what they wanted most , slam-dunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cheney to get what they wanted most , a war in Iraq for reasons predating 9/11 , their real whys for going to war had to be replaced by fictional , more salable ones . We would n't be invading Iraq to further Rovian domestic politics or neocon ideology ; we 'd be doing so instead because there was a direct connection between Saddam and Al Qaeda and because Saddam was on the verge of attacking America with nuclear weapons . The facts and intelligence had to be fixed to create these whys ; any contradictory evidence had to be dismissed or suppressed . <p> Mr. Libby and Mr. Cheney were in the boiler room of the disinformation factory . The vice president 's repetitive hyping of Saddam 's nuclear ambitions in the summer and fall of 2002 as well as his persistence in advertising bogus Saddam-Qaeda ties were fed by the rogue intelligence operation set up in his own office . As we know from many journalistic accounts , Mr. Cheney and Mr. Libby built their " case " by often making an end run around the C.I.A. , State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in cherry-picking intelligence was a similar cadre of neocon zealots led by Douglas Feith at the Pentagon . <p> THIS is what Col. Lawrence Wilkerson , then-Secretary of State Colin Powell 's wartime chief of staff , was talking about last week when he publicly chastised the " Cheney-Rumsfeld cabal " for sowing potential disaster in Iraq , North Korea and Iran . It 's this cabal that in 2002 pushed for much of the bogus W.M.D. evidence that ended up in Mr. Powell 's now infamous February 2003 presentation to the U.N . It 's this cabal whose propaganda was sold by the war 's unannounced marketing arm , the White House Iraq Group , or WHIG , in which both Mr. Libby and Mr. Rove served in the second half of 2002 . One of WHIG 's goals , successfully realized , was to turn up the heat on Congress so it would rush to pass a resolution authorizing war in the politically advantageous month just before the midterm election . <p> Joseph Wilson was n't a player in these exalted circles ; he was a footnote who began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the mission in Iraq had been " accomplished . " He challenged just one element of the W.M.D. " evidence , " the uranium that Saddam 's government had supposedly been seeking in Africa to fuel its ominous mushroom clouds . <p> But based on what we know about Mr. Libby 's and Mr. Rove 's hysterical over-response to Mr. Wilson 's accusation , he scared them silly . He did so because they had something to hide . Should Mr. Libby and Mr. Rove have lied to investigators or a grand jury in their panic , Mr. Fitzgerald will bring charges . But that crime would seem a misdemeanor next to the fables that they and their bosses fed the nation and the world as the whys for invading Iraq . <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com
