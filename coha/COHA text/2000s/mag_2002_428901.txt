It 's always a challenge to move to the next level . The transition from college football to the pros is not an easy task . Adjusting to the bigger size , speed and talent of new opponents presents a new learning opportunity for NFL rookies . However , when a first-year player comes into the NFL and makes his presence known on a team , his outstanding efforts do n't go unnoticed . In fact , it 's very rare that rookie players make major contributions to their teams . Anthony Thomas ' remarkable Sunday performances have helped the Chicago Bears-the team 's wins have doubled from last year and the Bears are playoff contenders for the first time in seven years .

What makes rookies rise above that is after they are given the opportunity to get on the field , they play at a level that coaches would hope they would play , but would have thought the type of play would-not come early . Their progression is quicker than expected . " Some other offensive rookie players who have been starting since the beginning of the season are Washington 's Rod Gardner and Minnesota 's Michael Bennett . As the speedster running back drafted first round out of Wisconsin , Bennett has made his playing power known on the Vikings .

" I did n't know I 'd be starting , but I knew I was going to get the opportunity to help my team and contribute . In training camp my goal was to learn everything I could , and I wanted to do that as quickly as possible .

You ca n't come in being scared or timid , or not being sure about yourself . A lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brashest , but you almost have to be because you are on an island by yourself : It 's just you and the wideout staring at you , and a lot of these guys like to play manon-man , bump and run . " Coaches will give rookie corners the opportunity to play with the understanding that they will get burned . Being burned once or twice or three times as a rookie is not cause for replacement . Even the best corners in the league get burned , " Scott said . New York Giants ' rookie corner Will Allen from Syracuse earned a starting nod from his team and has snatched three interceptions . Allen says with the time and effort he 's put in practicing , he is n't surprised that he starts . However , he said , " I 'm still trying to prove myself to my teammates and the rest of the league .
