<p> Hessler 's face goes slack while his sister , Jolene Davis , recounts one moment after the accident with equal parts warmth and wonder . <p> As Hessler sat alone , slumped and not breathing in his mashed Honda Accord , a passer-by stopped , crawled inside the wreck and lifted Hessler 's head . It restored his airway . It saved his life . <p> ' I know him ? ' Hessler asks , his voice high-pitched , his words thick and muddy . <p> Yes , he is told . He has since met that man , a Samaritan who has shunned both media interviews and public recognition . Inside the family , that man is called ' the angel . ' <p> Then , in a far different tone , Davis talks of ' the bastard , ' the driver of a gold Chevy Blazer who smacked Hessler 's purple Honda from behind , shoving it across an Interstate 76 median and into the path of an onrushing Ford F-150 pickup . <p> After the collision , the Blazer 's driver and a passenger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives in Colorado . They have n't been seen since and probably fled to Mexico , according to the Colorado State Patrol . <p> ' I was left to die in the car , ' Hessler says from his wheelchair . His rigid right hand brushes a fresh , pink scar on his scalp - where a titanium plate was implanted to restore his skull . He sustained a traumatic brain injury in the crash and lapsed into a coma for 33 days . <p> ' What are you most proud of ? ' he 's asked . <p> ' Just living . ' <p> ' Do you ever get angry , John ? ' <p> ' Yeah . ' <p> He is growing quieter now . <p> ' Do you ever ask why ? ' <p> He breaks into deep , shaking sobs . Jolene swoops in and whispers sunny , hopeful thoughts . Fifty-nine minutes out of every 60 , Hessler is upbeat , hopeful , even irreverent . But you have to allow a former elite athlete at least one minute of despair . <p> ' Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me ? ' <p> Suddenly , he is here , totally here , the same old ' Hess , ' with that crooked smirk and those teasing eyes . <p> He is plucking crunchy , brown leaves from a lemon-scented geranium during an occupational therapy session at Craig . <p> With a burning stare , Hessler jams stiff fingers into the wispy plant to root out anything dead or dying . It 's part of Hessler 's rigorous work to retrain a dormant right hand and sluggish right arm - once the tools of his trade while leading the CU offense on Saturday afternoons . <p> Earlier in the day , Hessler practiced feeding , dressing and grooming himself . Later , he will try to stand - with help - in a heated pool . There 's also speech therapy , hand-eye exercises and emotional counseling . His rehabilitation consumes at least three hours a day , five days a week . Right now , though , he 's gardening . <p> ' I feel like Martha Stewart , ' he tells occupational therapist Tiffany Dixon . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea Stewart is facing possible prison time for an insider-trading conspiracy . Jolene explains the criminal case . <p> ' She 's a cheater ! ' he yells . <p> More than one month of his life is utterly blank . But since emerging from the coma in late November - lifting a thumb and squeezing a hand before opening his eyes and , finally , speaking - Hessler has slowly rejoined the world . <p> At CU in the mid-1990s , his football progress was measured in 10-yard chunks . At Craig Hospital , Hessler 's recovery is gauged by his ability to sit up in bed with help , join family chats and raise his right arm . ( His left arm moves well , and he can shift his feet and legs in the wheelchair . ) His mind and short-term memory , the family says , are healing too . <p> ' There are some days John thinks clearer than others , ' Davis says . <p> ' He 's now an active participant in every conversation , ' adds Jenn Baker , a close friend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would n't remember who won the Super Bowl . He could n't even tell you who played the next day , or would not have remembered watching football . Now , he can tell you the basketball scores . ' <p> Hessler 's arms and legs are thinner now . He ca n't prop himself up in bed and ca n't walk . But based on his breakthroughs to date , his family and friends hold expectations for a full recovery . They talk about Hessler eventually walking out of Craig , an image the family clearly wants to project . <p> Hessler 's 5-year-old son , Devin , has n't been shown many of his father 's physical limits . Hessler also has retained his original , unadorned wheelchair - instead of upgrading to a glitzier model - to emphasize that this is all temporary . And the family declined to allow Hessler 's primary doctor to speak to The Denver Post . <p> Hope , the Hesslers understand , is good medicine . <p> ' No one 's willing to accept anything other than , ' This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's still the same to us , " Baker says . ' If we have to accept limitations , we 'll do it . But we do n't want to do it until the final say . We 'll keep saying that John will prove everyone wrong - and we 'll help him out . ' <p> Traumatic brain injuries can change how someone acts , thinks and moves . Speech can return , but patients may struggle with reasoning and problem-solving , or their thoughts may be slowed , according to the Brain Injury Association of Colorado . <p> Hessler has not been given a prognosis , Baker says , but he is expected to undergo a full evaluation in early April - the first true forecast for his life . <p> In people with similar injuries , physical and mental gains can continue for up to two years , says Dr. James Kelly , a neurologist who soon will join the faculty at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center . And Hessler 's small steps may prove to be gigantic . <p> When assessing a patient 's ultimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rehab , says Kelly , who is not one of Hessler 's doctors . Common victories show the brain is rebuilding itself . <p> So when Hessler prunes plants or chops vegetables in a cooking class , his brain may be rewiring communication pathways or sprouting new connections , Kelly says . <p> ' What we think is happening , in brain therapy , is we are using the spare or intact portions of the brain , those areas that are n't damaged , ' Kelly says . ' Then we push to their limits . ' <p> And push Hessler does . In the 94-degree waters of Craig Hospital 's rehab pool , Hessler is working on that stubborn right arm and his long-lost balance . <p> With the aid of a mesh harness , he has been hoisted off the tile deck and down into the pool . He sits on a submerged bench , just in front of therapist Kim Hutchinson , who holds Hessler from behind . <p> In a swimming motion , he reaches his left arm out and back . Then his right arm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Left . Right . <p> ' There you go ! ' Hutchinson says . ' Look what you just did ! ' <p> Wearing dark blue swim trunks trimmed in white , Hessler pauses to flirt with some women near the pool . He flashes a smile . But mainly his mind is keenly trained on the task at hand . His eyes are fixed on the green-tinted water . <p> Now it 's time to stand . <p> Hutchinson and another therapist , Jeanie Cowles , guide Hessler to his feet . He seems a bit unsure . And he is in pain . <p> ' It hurts ! ' Hessler says of his left leg . <p> A single complaint . And then silence . His face is calm . He just keeps working . <p> When your idol is the king of the comeback , you simply do n't expect to lose . <p> Ever . <p> Especially not now . <p> As a boy growing up in Brighton , Hessler ( and thousands of other kids across Colorado ) latched onto the late-game heroics of then-Broncos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of Colorado , Hessler even wore No. 7 , just like Elway . In truth , he did n't possess the electric arm or the confounding slipperiness of the Denver megastar . He even admitted goofing off in practice . But he was confident , calm under pressure , and loved to be told he was n't good enough . <p> As a sophomore in 1995 , Hessler saved the Buffs ' season when top quarterback Koy Detmer hurt his knee against No. 3-ranked Texas A &M.; Hessler rallied the offense to a 29-21 win that day and , ultimately , a 10-2 record along with a win in the Cotton Bowl . He played two more seasons at CU . <p> ' He was a guy who never got ruffled in big games . I view that as leadership , ' says Matt Russell , a senior linebacker on the ' 95 CU team and now a scout with the New England Patriots . <p> ' He 's the guy who is going to beat you at pool , beat you at bowling , beat you at pingpong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . ' It does n't matter what , he 's going to win . ' <p> That inner drive has not waned , Hessler says . <p> ' I just want to get better . That 's pretty much what I want . I want to know where I 'm at . I want to know who I am . I want to know how to do things . ' <p> He pauses . <p> ' I want to walk out of here . ' <p> ' The thing about John , ' adds Davis , ' is that nothing in life is salt ; everything in life is sugar . ' <p> And if the dozens of sweet letters on his personal website are any clue , Hessler has inspired his former fans with the true grit he brings to rehab . There are notes from his science students at Brighton 's Vikan Middle School . ( He also is an assistant football coach at Regis High School in Aurora . ) <p> There are occasional greetings from former CU teammates and uplifting notes from his family . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hessler 's world . <p> ' You called last night and wanted us to come and take you home , but we ca n't just yet . You have a few more tests to pass , and you will pass them , ' his parents wrote on Feb. 22 . <p> For vital boosts in down moments , Hessler taps his inner circle , he says , including his parents , Keith and June ; his girlfriend , Sanja ; and his siblings , Jolene and brothers Jason and Josh . <p> Mostly , though , he thinks about his son , Devin , who lives with Hessler during the summers . Snapshots of the smiling boy are taped just above his hospital bed . <p> ' When you have a son , ' Hessler says , ' he means everything to you . ' <p> But mending a brain is n't cheap . Hessler 's care at Craig costs nearly $ 2,000 a day , Baker says , and insurance to pay for the hospital stay ran out March 11 . So the Hesslers are planning a fundraiser and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Invesco Field . The tickets are $ 500 . So far , the family has sold about 140 out of 200 tickets . <p> The goal is to field enough donations to keep Hessler at Craig through the end of April . <p> After his discharge , family members will care for Hessler as he continues his recovery . <p> And then there is the final goal , the icy-sweet temptation that keeps Hessler and his entire clan plugging . <p> ' There will be margaritas on a beach somewhere , ' Baker says . <p> Hessler grins and sighs as a sunny gleam fills his eyes . <p> ' Jamaica , ' he says . <p> The crash itself is merely a legend to John Hessler , a scary story he asks his family to tell over and over , as if to spark a brain that 's yet to fully wake . <p> ' I want to remember right now , ' the former University of Colorado quarterback says with a trace of desperation . <p> So , inside his Craig Hospital room - a cozy cave packed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hears yet again about the sickening crunch of metal last Oct. 19 . He hears about the hero , and he hears about the villain . <p> ' I just want to get better . That 's pretty much what <p> I want . I want to know where I 'm at . I want to know who <p> I am . I want to know how <p> to do things . a I want to walk out of here . ' <p> John Hessler  --  <p> FUNDRAISER <p> A fundraiser for John Hessler 's medical bills will be held from 6 to 9 p.m .
