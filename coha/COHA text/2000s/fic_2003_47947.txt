Lucy calls Greg up as soon as she gets to her office . She was the one who had to run , as soon as the teacher conference was over , who took off out of there like a bat out of hell , heading for her car , leaving Greg to walk more leisurely home , no doubt stopping on the way for a pricey cup of coffee . That 's the academic life for you ; he 'll run into half the neighborhood out for a stroll or sipping in the coffeehouse . Lucy herself drove dangerously right across town and then lucked into a perfect parking place at the hospital , the occasional bright benefit of coming late to work , when you get a spot right next to the building , a spot some night-shift nurse maybe occupied at one a.m. , and has now vacated neatly in time for your tardy arrival . <p> A fast drive and a lucky parking spot mean that Lucy is right on time for her ten o'clock appointment , and then to further her sense that God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns out that the social worker has called and the Williams twins are not in fact coming in for their asthma compliance checks today , and she basically has an hour free . So she kicks her office door shut , sinks down in her chair , slips out of her shoes , and dials Greg at home . <p> " Howdy there , Paw , " she says , and he starts to laugh . <p> " Gee , Maw , " he says back , " guess you'n me have done gotten our hillbilly asses mixed up with some mighty high-steppin ' folks . " <p> " Back on the farm , we thought folks was dressed nice if'n they did n't have their long Johns on outside their overalls , " Lucy says , but she knows the joke is over . <p> " What an unbelievable self-righteous sugarcoated poisonous bitch ! " <p> " Jesus Christ , " Lucy says , signaling agreement . <p> The first-grade teacher sat across the little round table from them , all three of them too big for the first-grade chairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks , as they have only ever seen her look , competent and patient . She wears slacks and a sweater , and she usually has on a piece of fun jewelry , a cow made out of beads and sequins , or a necklace that looks like painted Tinkertoys . Her name is Mrs. Gallow , and Lucy finds these pieces of jewelry remind her of the bright smocks and scrub jackets printed with cartoon characters that nurses sometimes wear to make children think they do n't carry needles . Greg has been calling her Old Gallows all year , strictly in the privacy of his own home , of course . <p> And this is the woman to whom they send their sweet , strange Freddy each and every weekday morning . Actually , their sweet , strange Freddy likes her fine , as much as he ever likes-or notices-an adult female other than his mother or his grandmother , which is to say , if you ask him how he likes the class , he 'll politely tell you fine , and if you ask him if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , and if you ask him what her name is , he can now , three months into the year , usually remember it , and Lucy thinks he could probably pick her out of a police lineup . And surely , if the earth opened and swallowed up Mrs. Gallow , Freddy would put down his baseball cards long enough to ask anxiously who was going to be the teacher tomorrow , since change of any kind makes Freddy a little nervous . Well , maybe he would n't actually put down the cards , but he might pause in laying them out . <p> It 's not that Lucy and Greg were expecting a completely smooth parent-teacher conference . Those are what they have with their daughter Isabel 's teachers , always and forever , as Greg says , as long as the sun shall shine and the grass shall grow , and the Great White Father rules in Washington . Freddy 's kindergarten teacher last year , an almost insanely good-natured , guitar-playing young woman named Sandy Sullivan ( Greg called her Sister Bertrille ) had folded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some of Freddy 's habits might seem , well , a little bit peculiar to some of the other kids , though of course everyone loved him , and gosh , you could just tell he was so smart . But Freddy has , they hope , gotten a little less strange and a little less scared , and in any case , here in first grade , surely the fact that he can read like a grown-up and do math like at least a fourth-grader must count for something . Lucy , who lost the coin toss and sat through Open Classroom night , remembers one long chain of reassurances for all the parents whose children still were n't reading . Everyone will read by the end of the year , everyone always does , Mrs. Gallow assured the parents over and over , and Lucy , who knew exactly how Greg would suggest that Old Gallows achieves those perfect results ( a pack of slavering wild dogs to whom the non-readers are thrown in May ) , sat through the whole evening with the complacent smile of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire for the third time . <p> And yes , indeed , Mrs. Gallow had only kind words for Freddy 's reading skills . Something about the woman , every time she says " Freddy , " you imagine her putting a " Little " in front of it . She just has that kind of smarm in her voice . <p> " Clearly Little Freddy has wonderful reading skills , " she said , but with very lukewarm enthusiasm . Clearly , Lucy thought , Old Gallows was more in her element talking to the parents of the children who had reading problems . " He 's a very strong reader , and of course we try to encourage that . " <p> No you do n't , thought Lucy , you have him reading Frog and Toad with the other good readers , you have no idea at all what he 's interested in , or what goes on in his brain . For which we should perhaps be thankful . Freddy 's reading career is being shaped completely by his older sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby books . Freddy likes baby books , mind you ; he needs One Fish , Two Fish , Red Fish , Blue Fish read aloud at least twice every night-once on the couch before he has his bath , and once when he is in his bed , with his blankets and his decks of cards all properly arranged-with the result that every member of the family knows it by heart . Before that it was Madeline and the Bad Hat , and before that it was Norton Hears a Who . Lucy is happiest with One Fish , Two Fish , which seems to her , as she reads the familiar rhymes night after night , to be full of great and pungent wisdom to be applied in daily life . <p> " She does n't get him at all , does she ? " Greg asks . " She sees him every day , and she has n't got the faintest idea who he is . It 's kind of sad , really . " <p> " It 's probably lucky for us , " Lucy says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> She feels safe , is the funny thing . Safe and right where she belongs , here in her tiny and not at all cozy office , which she has never bothered to decorate in any way . Connected by phone to Greg , who is home in his office in their house . <p> This is no good , this is not right . My feet stick out of bed all night . <p> And when I pull them in , oh dear ! My head sticks out of bed up here ! <p> In the picture , the sad-faced , fuzzy-edged beast sticks his legs out through two holes cut in the board at the bottom of his bed-then on the next page , his feet are in the bed , but his woebegone head protrudes through a hole in the headboard . <p> Oh , they tried with Mrs. Gallow . They told her what a wonderful year Freddy was having in her wonderful classroom . In fact , when they first came in , prompt to the minute , another matched set of parents ushered out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Lucy worried it might be too much . The murals ! The Our Book Forest display of all the different books they 've read ! Those wonderful African bark paintings they 've been making ! They tried hard to make her like them , because they believe , of course , these two overeducated advanced-degree types , that if she does n't like them , she will take it out on Freddy , who is pretty completely in her power . And of Freddy they are highly protective , always worrying that the world will fall in on him , and he will discover the terrible truth : that he sticks out in all directions . <p> Mrs. Gallow gave Freddy his due : Reads well . Good at math . Much better now about not interrupting at circle time . She pointed to a large sign : Our Classroom Rules-Help Make 1-G a Great Place to Learn and Share . And Greg and Lucy sat there and nodded appreciatively at her bland and all-purpose remarks about their child , and admired the math quiz sheet she showed them on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer fifteen times out of fifteen . <p> She saved it for a kicker . They were winding up , thanking her for her time and for giving Freddy such a wonderful year . They thought they were safe and free : no big problems , no concerns , no questions . There is one thing , she said . <p> Lucy braced . She can remember bracing , physically , her feet flat against the classroom floor , her shoulders suddenly tight . She did not look directly at Greg . <p> " Freddy comes to school , well ... " Mrs. Gallow paused , as if it was almost too awful to be said . Then she made herself do her duty . " Freddy comes to school looking as if he has slept in his clothes . I mean , it 's one thing to wear sweatpants , I know some of the boys do wear sweatpants to school-but they should be neat , and there should n't be any holes . And the T-shirts are just always so wrinkled , and sometimes there are stains , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath , cut her eyes sideways quickly at Greg . He was carefully not looking at her . Greg , she noticed , had done Mrs. Gallow the courtesy of putting on a jacket . Under the jacket , though , he wore a brown cotton T-shirt which had definitely seen better days . In fact , Lucy could see clearly , the edge of the neck was fraying in a slightly moth-eaten scalloping , and there was a halo of tiny pinprick holes around the seam which joined the neckband to the shirt . Great . She straightened even more in her tiny awkward chair . <p> " I 'm not saying this to make him feel bad . But you know , sooner or later the other children will start to notice this , so we might as well start now to get Freddy looking right . " <p> Thank you so much , Mrs. Gallow . We 'll get on it right away . How good of you to clue us in . What a great-looking classroom . They bobbed and nodded and bowed . Thank you for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be replaced , immediately , by the next parental dynamic duo , who were poised for their moment , out in the hall . <p> Greg said two things as they hurried out of the building , Lucy moving fast to get to her car and get to the hospital in time for the Williams twins . First was , You know it would be as much as your fucking life was worth to come for a fucking parent-teacher conference with only one fucking parent in this fucking school . Lucy wanted to hush him-all Freddy needed was to have his parents expelled from the building for obscenity . Second was , as they were already outside and heading for the car , Greg swung on her and said , For Christ 's sake , he 's a little boy ! He has food on him because he 's a messy eater ! Do n't we want them to play outside ? If they play outside they get dirty , or their clothes get torn , and that 's what it 's like for little boys ! <p> " Goodbye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then , key already out and poised , she was inside her car . Leaned out the window , though , and called to him , though she does n't know if he heard it , " Check out that T-shirt you 're wearing ! " <p> What a great project for the whole family , she and Greg whisper back and forth that evening : First we 'll iron Freddy 's T-shirts . Then we 'll fold them so tenderly into perfect rectangles . Oh , and maybe one of us should run out and buy starch-needless to say , there is no starch in the house , except for the pasta on the kitchen table . Isabel has finished eating the one exact portion of rigatoni that she allows herself , and is peeling a clementine with fastidious fingertips . Freddy himself has half a plateful left , but he has drifted dreamily away from eating , and instead he is arranging his rigatoni into careful furrows . A noodle shoots off his plate and onto his lap , and Isabel gives him a look of disgust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some common ground . <p> And what about this business of not sending Freddy to school in sweatpants ? What fun for everyone , looking for some pants that are n't sweatpants . Once there were some jeans , but Freddy has n't worn them in months , and they are not easily findable . And anyway , for Christ 's sake , Freddy has trouble with snaps and zippers . Hey , how about we just let him wear his sweatpants and leave him alone , okay ? <p> After the kids are in bed , Lucy thinks , she and Greg will pursue the joke far enough to have clean and ironed and neatly folded clothes waiting for tomorrow . So okay , so it 's stupid , but it 's doable and they 'll do it and they 'll be done . <p> But you can never draw a single safe breath when your name is out there on the fifth-grade phone tree . Oh , you can run , but you ca n't hide . <p> Jesse Baxter 's mother , the terminally over-involved Bianca Baxter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been an incident in the fifth grade and the school was taking it very , very seriously and there would be a meeting for all fifth-grade parents the next day at three ? <p> " An incident ? " Lucy 's brain ranges generously : a sexual molestation , a racial epithet written on the wall , a gun found in someone 's backpack . And at the same time a squeak of protest from her very bowels : I went in late this morning because of the fucking parent-teacher conference , how can I take tomorrow afternoon off for a meeting ? <p> " The school is taking it very seriously , " Bianca Baxter intones , yet a second time . <p> " What kind of incident ? " <p> " I do n't know all the details . I think Ms. Lederer is going to go over those at the meeting tomorrow . I really feel she 's excellent in a crisis , do n't you ? " <p> Lucy tries to imagine Ms. Lederer in a crisis . What can Bianca be thinking of ? The capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woodworking studio ? Ms. Lederer is a personage , all right , but who the hell has ever seen her in a crisis ? <p> " What 's the crisis , Bianca ? " Lucy asks patiently . Then , craftily , " I 'm going to have to call the next family on the phone tree , and I 'm sure they 're going to ask . " Thinking , Where the hell is the phone tree , or will Isabel possibly remember who came next after us , or should I just confess and ask this hellhound herself who I 'm supposed to call ? <p> " Oh , do n't worry about that , Lucy . I know you guys are awfully busy , so I just went ahead and called the Rogers myself , earlier this afternoon . So that 's all taken care of . I thought I 'd wait and call you later because I know how busy your schedule is . " <p> " One of us will try to make the meeting , " Lucy says wearily . " But if you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , I should get off the phone and call Abby 's mother , because she 's pretty plugged in , and she might have some idea . " Take that , you bright-winged avatar of death and destruction ! <p> " Well , I 'll tell you what I know , " Bianca says . " There was an incident where some girls were tormenting another girl . " <p> " So ? " Lucy ca n't help it . These girls have been happily tormenting one another since pre-K . It gives them a reason to get up in the morning . <p> " Epithets were used , " Bianca says , lowering her voice . <p> " Racial epithets ? " <p> " No , not that , " Bianca says with clear relief . " Not quite as bad as that , but almost . Ms. Lederer called them socioeconomic epithets . The school is taking this very seriously . " <p> From there to here , from here to there , <p> Funny things are everywhere . <p> Freddy hates the jeans , which Lucy has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laundry . Freddy can not zip the zipper or snap the snap at the top of the zipper . He is n't strong enough , he says . The zipper keeps slipping out of his hands . The snap does n't work right . He says he has never seen these pants before , even though Lucy feels sure that he must have worn them . Freddy is so thin that he does n't really outgrow his pants , they just gradually get too short , but the jeans have rolled cuffs and could go for years . No , Freddy says . I want my sweatpants . I wo n't wear these awful stupid pants to school . Other kids wear jeans , Lucy says , reduced to the lowest level . But I do n't , says Freddy , in no doubt whatsoever . And then finally , clearly , as she goes on suggesting it , just wear them for a day , Freddy says to her , If I wear them , I wo n't be able to go to the bathroom . I wo n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . <p> Well , yes , there 's that . Lucy imagines Mrs. Gallow , her righteous , concerned phone call . Okay , Freddy . Game , set , and match . Sweatpants it is , elastic waists forever , thus saith the Lord , thus say we all . <p> So Greg will go . He has to . He expresses himself eloquently about losing the afternoon , one of his precious at-home afternoons , when he teaches in the morning and then zips back home , puts on one of those suspect T-shirts , and works on his book . But Lucy has patients scheduled , and she did take the morning off for the parent-teacher conference , and although they do subject one another to a short episode in the long-running drama of my work is just as important to me as yours is to you even though I do some of it at home , Greg will go . It is n't even too long a fight , because Lucy has strategized it right ; she gets the stuff about the parent meeting in there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to hear more . So all the time he is petulantly demanding to know whether she really has patients , whether she ca n't end her day a little early instead of asking him to end his , and did n't she go racing in this morning and find the patients had canceled after all , Greg is really wanting to finish the argument , and get back to the question of socioeconomic epithets . They ca n't ask Isabel , Lucy warns him ; Bianca Baxter said it was not to be discussed with the kids until tomorrow . Well , they might have bent that rule , but Isabel has taken the occasion of her parents ' argument to get herself virtuously into bed , and is sleeping what may be the fake but ostentatious sleep of those whose homework was done hours ago , whose trim folders are already neatly packed into the backpack for tomorrow . <p> So by the time they go to bed , they 're friends again , united in the face of what Greg calls the prep-school double whammy : two compulsory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " What do you think they said ? " Greg asks . They are lying together in the middle of their bed , a good sign that the day is ending well . Greg 's arm is splayed out across the bed , and Lucy pillows her neck on exactly the right comfortable part of his bicep . She lets herself think about starting to stroke his stomach , right around his belly button , where there is a soft tuft of hair . It 's a weeknight , but it 's not too late , and do n't people need a little reward in between ironing their six-year-old 's T-shirts and trotting off to the compulsory parent meeting to discuss the fifth-grade socioeconomic epithet emergency ? <p> " My dad 's richer than your dad , " Lucy sings softly , to that old , old teasing tune . Her hand finds the little tuft of hair . <p> " How come your parents take you to that cut-rate ski resort every winter ? Why do n't you own a condo in Vail like all the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thickening , and he folds his arm back over her , pulling her close . <p> Lucy feels righteously glad that the next afternoon is , in fact , incredibly busy . She has sat through an interminable lunchtime meeting about ICD-9 billing codes and reimbursement and productivity , every doctor 's least favorite subjects and easily the tenth such meeting this year , and the meeting ran over a little because one of her colleagues got very angry about how it was easily the tenth such meeting this year , and started ranting at the new Special Billing Codes Consultant , who no doubt charged the hospital royally for the extra twenty minutes he spent listening to the rant . And that meant that all the afternoon patients got backed up , because by the time everyone got back to clinic and got down to work , they were almost forty minutes behind , and it turned out to be one of those afternoons when everyone who is scheduled shows up , and some of them bring their cousins . <p> So she spares a thought for poor old Greg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she finishes removing the sutures from a well-healed laceration above Katika Lashore 's right eye . This is maybe Katika 's sixth or seventh injury requiring stitches ; she 's three now , and the first four or five injuries were part of what got her taken out of her bio mother 's home and placed in foster care , although there were plenty of other issues as well , like the fact that she had never had any immunizations and she was fifteen months old . But whatever foster home you place her in , Katika will find something sharp to butt her forehead against , or a creative way to fall off a little tricycle and slice her leg on the edge of a chain-link fence . <p> Katika , who is sealed neatly into a papoose , a massive Velcro cocoon , toddler-sized , for holding small children down and still , is screaming like the proverbial banshee , but she stops the moment Lucy straightens up , her back aching slightly from the effort of holding her arms and hands so tightly tensed , snipping and pulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Katika 's dark skin . The nurse releases Katika from the papoose , and she is immediately upright on the exam table , standing on the open papoose , and no doubt contemplating a swan dive off onto the floor . Her foster mother , moving fast , gathers her up and provides her with a massive lollipop , ready to hand in her purse . <p> And how remarkable it is , when you stop and think about it , that you can stitch children 's skin up and see it heal , close over and grow together , as if the broken glass or the table edge or the chain-link fence had been a minor disruption . <p> " It was completely insane , " Greg tells her . " Lunatic . " <p> " Retarded , " contributes Isabel , and is immediately shushed by both her parents . You ca n't use that word , not ever . Do you want us to have to sit through another compulsory parent meeting with a special consultant on working through ability-related epithets ? Anti-disability slurs ? Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning that some people are slower mentally and some people are quicker mentally and both ways are good ? Have a care , Isabel , show a little mercy to your parents . <p> And after all that , nobody even knows exactly what was said and done . Isabel comes closest to knowing , of course , because the fifth grade has been buzzing . And the actual culprits , Kate Dykstra and Michelle Blumenthal , are known , and are walking around the school with red-rimmed eyes and a certain aura of drama-queen untouchable evil , having spent the last two days in multiple meetings and what Isabel calls lamebrained therapy sessions , with teachers and counselors and with their victim , Vanessa Hubbell . Isabel , of course , can keep all this straight without any trouble at all , keeps much more complicated things straight all the time . It 's her clueless parents who keep mixing it up and saying Michelle when they mean Vanessa . <p> But even Isabel does not know exactly what Kate and Michelle said to Vanessa , except that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes not being very nice and her dad only being a carpenter . In fact , George Hubbell is a very much in demand cabinetmaker , who probably charges enough every time he redoes one of Vanessa 's classmate 's kitchens to pay her way through till twelfth grade quite comfortably , thank you very much . In fact , Lucy and Greg , who could never ever afford a renovation on his fine-woods-custom-built terms , have in the past joked that for George Hubbell , the school tuition is a business expense ; it 's how he meets his clients . But there is no question that he drives a van with his name written on it , and he does n't wear a suit . And if it comes to that , neither does Greg wear a suit , though academic drag is so well-understood in these parts , including its high-prestige-low-rent implications , that perhaps even the slower fifth-grade girls get the picture . <p> Anyway , Kate and Michelle made Vanessa cry . Which is nothing very new or surprising , if you ask Isabel ; last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but no one else went running to Miss Rexall , the school counselor , who just happened to have recently returned from an independent school counselor retreat ( bet that was a treat of a retreat , Greg commented ) at which a whole afternoon session had focused on socioeconomic epithets , led by these wonderful consultants , who were the same ones she brought in today to lead one compulsory assembly for the fifth graders , and one for their parents . <p> " Un . Fucking . Believable . We had to sit through a fucking PowerPoint presentation about different ways that people can make other people feel bad . Personal epithets . Racial epithets . Ethnic epithets . Socioeconomic epithets . " <p> " It 's a rough world . " <p> " And then this **34;1498;TOOLONG woman puts us through this insane discussion , calling on people left and right , about how we all feel about there being some socioeconomic discrepancies in the school , and how we 're going to help our kids handle that . " <p> " Just so you know , Iz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lucy announces to her daughter , who is happily perched on a kitchen chair watching them pull dinner together , happy to be part of their aristocracy of disgust on a brief break from her own . " You happen to go to a school which costs a great deal of money , and some of the families there are very , very rich , and some are only very rich , and then there are people like us , and we 're perfectly comfortable and highly privileged , and do n't you ever forget it , but by the standards of your school , we are probably down at the bottom . So you , Isabel , are the socioeconomic discrepancy . " <p> " It 's like describing the black children as the diversity , " Greg tells her , helpfully . " It 's called euphemism . " <p> " Oh , " says Isabel , worldly wise and weary , " it 's just their usual PC stuff , that 's all . " <p> " This woman , " Greg says , covering the tomato @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I thought she was kidding , I honestly did at first . She had a fucking flip chart , and she was writing down what people said about ways to help children think about socioeconomic discrepancy here at Master Race Academy . And people are saying things like , Well , be honest , so she writes down HONESTY . How much do you think she got paid for this performance ? " <p> Lucy thinks of the hospital billing consultant ; word is he 's pulling in a cool ten thousand a week . <p> Automatically , she and Greg both turn towards Isabel and start , " You ca n't call it- " <p> " Master Race Academy , I know , I never do . How much did she get paid ? " <p> " We 're in the wrong businesses , " Lucy says . " That 's why we 're the socioeconomic discrepancy . " <p> " You think you guys had it bad ? " Isabel asks . Without anyone suggesting it , she has started setting the table , on their side and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the room and say what we thought went with being part of different socioeconomic groups . And she wrote it all down on one of those flip charts , too . " <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> " Oh , you know . Like there are blue-collar people who do n't wear jackets and ties and they do n't make much money and they drink beer . " <p> Lucy and Greg regard their daughter . She is folding the paper napkins into swans , one for each place setting . When Isabel sets a table , she sets a table . She looks up to see them staring . <p> " Do n't ask me . It was what we had to do . We wrote down what we thought were all the assumptions and prejudices about different socioeconomic groups , and then she led this discussion about how all of them were equally good in their different ways and we should never make anyone feel bad about which one they belong to . " <p> " You mean , " Lucy says cautiously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very wealthy ? " <p> " That 's what Andy Constantine said , " says Isabel , who almost never mentions a boy , and who has mentioned this particular boy before . " He asked if she thought it was just as bad to make fun of people for being rich as for being poor , and she said yes , it was , because people could n't help what they were and it was just as good to be one way as another . " <p> " And what did you guys all think of that ? " asks Lucy in a neutral tone , to head off the tirade she can see coming from Greg 's direction . Yes , indeed , is this why we pay these insane tuition bills , so they can babble this incoherent meaningless crapola at our children ? Just as good to be one way as another . The socialist millennium has come , and its name is Mason-Rickover Country Day . <p> " We all thought it was completely and totally re- I mean , lame . Sorry . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this stuff , where you have to process it and process it when all the time you know that Michelle and Kate were just being Michelle and Kate . I mean , they probably said that stuff because Vanessa is even skinnier than they are , because usually they go around asking people if they want their waists measured . " <p> " You do understand that all of this is total crap ? " Greg says . " All your stuff about blue-collar people drinking beer-those are stupid cliches . Social class in this country , and socioeconomic status , is much more complicated than that - and much more interesting . " It 's a little bit his lecturing voice , and Isabel likes it . The table is beautifully laid , napkin swans and the good water glasses and four matching plates-the only four left , as it happens , from their old set , but Isabel dug through the dish closet and found them all . <p> " Like Vanessa 's father , " Lucy adds . " You can be a carpenter who is an extremely talented and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a person who makes lots of money and who does n't have enough time to do the work for all the people that want him . That does n't mean that it was okay for Michelle and Kate to say those things-it would have been wrong to say them if Vanessa 's family were poor , and wrong to say them if Vanessa 's family was rich . Michelle and Kate are rude and stupid and mean-but you already knew that . " <p> Isabel grins at them both : indeed she did . " I bet , " she says , " that Vanessa 's family has more than four matching plates . " <p> Greg nods . " In their inlaid teak and ebony cabinets , " he says . <p> Look what we found in the park in the dark . <p> We will take him home . We will call him Clark . <p> He will live at our house . He will grow and grow . <p> Will our mother like this ? We do n't know . <p> Lucy 's favorite page . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flask filled with turquoise water , and floating happily in the water is a Dr. Seuss creature , much bigger than either of the children . His flippers wave languidly in the water , the two horns at either side of his mouth turn upwards in a friendly kind of way , and his topknot is downright perky . The children are clearly moving fast , hurrying to show him to their mother . It always makes Lucy smile , and when she turns to that page , Freddy always checks her face . <p> Lucy sits on the couch , with Freddy curled up beside her . His T-shirt , which really did start the day washed , ironed , and folded , now bears extensive evidence of the tomato sauce from dinner . Probably , buried under those stains , there are stains from lunch , or dirt from recess , or paint from art class . Why should n't he accumulate a little road dust as he goes through his day , doing his best ? Why ca n't the school get a consultant in to teach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the way home and bought him one pair of elastic-waist chinos . They may be a little too short , but they 're the biggest size she could find with an elastic waist . She had to cut the price tags off before Freddy would try them on , because he 's scared of those little white plastic strings that hold tags on to clothes . And then , since she 'd already cut the price tags off , she went ahead and cut off the label , since labels always bother Freddy . Anything to encourage him to try the pants on and like them . <p> And he did pull them on . And they looked , to be honest , terrible on him , silly high-water-mark pants bunched around his too-skinny waist . Or maybe it was the way he stood in them , tense and miserable , wanting his sweatpants or his pajamas . Freddy does not take easily to any innovation . And then Lucy , looking at him in his misery-over what , after all , over nothing-had one of those bad moments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what life will hold for him .

Think of Katika Lashore , and the way she heals up after tearing her skin open . <p> But okay . She will get Freddy into bed , and then she will go iron a T-shirt for tomorrow . She will iron a T-shirt and the one pair of sweatpants which has no holes whatsoever , and put them on a hanger in the kitchen , and Greg will come in and see it and crack up . Poor boy , you 're going to have to learn to struggle with those snaps and zippers . Ca n't stay a hillbilly forever , not at Master Race Academy . <p> Isabel is still hovering close , very unusual . Sat with them in the kitchen before dinner , set the table , and now she is sitting right across the room in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girls ' book series called The Royal Diaries ( which Greg keeps saying he hopes will issue a volume on Isabella herself , and how she launched Columbus and did in the Jews . Isabella and the Inquisition , he has suggested it should be called ) . Is it possible that Isabel is actually somewhat shaken by what is going on in her school ? Certainly they seem to be fomenting a certain hysteria , processing and reprocessing and never ever leaving things alone , which is how they always do it . That school counselor is a notorious menace . Miss Rexall . She lives to make a small private meanness into a large public trauma for all concerned . <p> " Come sit with us , " Lucy says to her daughter . Who closes her book and crosses to join them on the couch , sitting on Lucy 's other side and actually leaning very slightly against her mother . Tense and tight and controlled she is , but she is leaning . Lucy turns a page of One Fish , Two Fish , moving slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she turns back a couple of pages and reads them her very favorite page once again . She is fond of the picture of the children bringing home the strange and large whiskered monster , Clark : look what we found in the park in the dark . They carry him in his big round balloon-like tank . He will live at our house , he will grow and grow , will our mother like this , we do n't know ! She loves it just for its trueness to the spirit of childish determination and trouble , for its sly manic certainty about what Mother will actually think . But over time , reading this story again and again , she has come to wonder whether in fact Freddy himself is Clark , whether Isabel is Clark , whether in fact Clark is just the child who comes out of the dark to live at your house and grow and grow . <p>
