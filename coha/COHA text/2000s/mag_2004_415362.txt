Twelve years after they met a messy end , there 's life after death for these four unlikely alt-rock legends , by Tom Sinclair // IT WOULD PROBABLY TAKE KURT COBAIN BEING RESURRECTed and fronting Nirvana again to generate the excitement among the alt-rock cognoscenti that the current Pixies reunion tour-running through December in the U.S. and elsewhere-has . In the 12 years since Pixies mainman Frank " Charles Thompson " Black ( a.k.a . Black Francis ) , 39 , pulled the plug on the band , the cosmic hunger for Pixies music-with its Dada-dipped lyrics and creeping verses/crashing choruses trick ( famously adopted by the aforementioned Nirvana , among others ) - has grown to a fever pitch . " We made a deal with the DiscLive people out of New York to record and sell what 's basically a bootleg of the show after the show , and everyone 's snapping them up , " says Black . " They 're going , " F- the T-shirts-give us the disc ! ' ' " It 's a marked contrast to the past decade , during which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career as Frank Black and the Catholics , while bassist Kim Deal , 43 , watched the Breeders , the band she helmed with sister Kelly , go from white hot to ice cold . Guitarist Joey Santiago , 39 ( who has played in Black 's Catholics ) , co-led his own under-the-radar duo , the Martinis , with his wife , Linda Mallari , while drummer David Lovering , 42 , had until recently been paying the rent as a professional magician . Now , with the band selling out shows virtually everywhere , the Pixies are finally in agreement with their fans regarding that old adage about the whole being greater than the sum of its parts . Listen2This recently caught up with them on the morning after a triumphant gig at the Forum in London . L2T How does it feel to be the world 's foremost alt-rock nostalgia act ? KIM DEAL Even if people did look at it as nostalgia , it would n't bother me because it 's like , I do n't have to get back into my leather trousers , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ugly and we did n't move on stage then , and we 're still ugly and we do n't move now . How many people can we actually disappoint ? It 's not like we have to get back into Kiss makeup again . Maybe if Charles had been a sex god and all the girls had pictures of him in their bedrooms , and then we came back , and now he 's heavy and he does n't have hair-we 'd think we 're gon na disappoint a lot of people . But since we never had that anyway , the reunion never felt too stupid to do . L2T You guys have had offers to get back together before this , have n't you ? KD In 2000 , I got a letter from our manager saying " I 've sent all the Pixies this letter to let you know that every summer we get enormous offers of money to get together to do summer festivals in Europe . I 'm just letting you know that it 's there and available . " I thought , Oh , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gee , they would be offering us a lot of money . So I thought that was nice . But I did n't entertain the idea of us getting back together . JOEY SANTIAGO Frank was adamant about not doing it for the longest time . FRANK BLACK My reaction : " No way , Jos , " I think is the expression . L2T Why did you finally capitulate ? FB Well , I 'll just say you 're a lot more bullheaded when you 're in your twenties : " I 'll never play those songs again ! " I was able to milk that attitude for 12 years , probably gradually softening with each season . L2T Did n't your decision to reform the band grow out of your joking around in an interview about how you and the other Pixies were hang-out buddies ? FB Yeah , it 's kind of funny how that happened . It got repeated around town as fact , everyone saying " And they 're probably gon na get back together , too " - which I did n't say at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media outlets , so then I was , like , " Uh , sure , why not . " I called Joey . I suppose he and I are close , or whatever , and I knew he was in contact with Kim . So he was the obvious person to call to get things going . I think I knew everyone would be interested , although I was n't sure if Kim would be interested necessarily . Black and Deal had allegedly been involved in a bitter feud over creative differences at the time of the band 's breakup . The only trepidation I had was I was nervous that the gigs would n't go well because it would be too much of a party or something . We had n't gigged in a long time , and I did n't want it to be too sloppy . But that was just my own paranoia . So we initially booked a North American warm-up tour last spring . By the time those gigs actually happened , I was n't concerned about it at all . But it was fun-a nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the rest of you guys react to the idea of a reunion ? JS I had everyone 's numbers and stuff , so I called . Frank had everyone 's numbers too , I think , but , you know , I got along with Kim . Kim to me was like the wild card . I said , " Everyone 's in now . So we 're just askin ' you ... " And she just went , " Hmmmm . Now are you asking me in case I do n't wan na do it , then you guys would have permission to use someone else ? " I was like , " No ! Absolutely not ! That would be the biggest nightmare . " Basically , I said , " Please . It would n't be a " reunion " without you . " She said , " Okay ! " DAVID LOVERING Joey 's call changed everything , 180 degrees , completely around . To be candid , it was a pretty bad time of my life . I was involved in a bad relationship with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -I 'm talkin " the worst , where it was just gon na destroy me . I had a restraining order against her , the whole deal . It was horrible . I have scars from champagne bottles being broken over my head . It was a really , really , really bad , bad day . And I remember walking to the bank . I could n't even drive my car . I had my cell phone , and I 'm just about to get into the bank , and Joe rings . Said , " Guess what ? We 're getting back together ! " I go , " Yeah , yeah , bulls- . " He says , " No , it 's true . " And I swear to God , I just jumped through the roof . I was ecstatic . L2T Wow . What happened to the woman ? DL She 's in prison now . Which is a good thing . It will hopefully help her . L2T The relationships within the band were really strained back in ' ' 92 , when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's good . We 're certainly not in a difficult position . We show up at a place like last night , and people are so happy to see us play . We just show up and do the set list . Maybe if we were working on songs and there were these difficult decisions and we had to interact and really communicate a lot , maybe it would n't have worked and we would n't be getting along . JS On occasion I 'll get a call from whoever . Kim 'll call and be just , like , " Hey , you want a cup of coffee ? I found a Starbucks . Let 's hang out . " It 's nicer now . F B Our first time back together was at the Breeders rehearsal space in downtown L.A. It was very uneventful . It was just sort of like , " Oh , hey . " There was nervousness , I 'm sure , leading up to that moment . But when the moment arrived , we were in this humble little rehearsal space in a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar circumstances to our early rehearsals in 1986 or whatever-and it all kind of seemed very natural . It did n't seem like any time had passed , really . L2T The Pixies recently recorded a new song , Kirn 's " Bam Thwok , " available on iTunes . What are the chances for a CD of new material ? DL We 're taking it one day at a time . We talked about it-we really do n't need to do a record . We 're doing a hits tour in support of Wave ' of Mutilation : Best of Pixies , there is plenty of material , there are corporate gigs and other ways to make money . It 's not a very good time to be in a band and on a record label right now , anyway . FB We 're not in a rush for a lot of different reasons . One , we 're touring , and it 's kind of hard to write songs when you 're on the road . Without sounding like I 'm tooting our own horn too much , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catalogue , and we do n't wan na make the mistake of " Here 's our new shitty music . " It 's got ta be really good . And it 's hard to be really good . I mean , we made a coupla good moves when we were 23 , but it 's just like , let 's count to 10 before we make some lame move . Why go through the process of emoting and creating all this music and potentially working with a label and spending all this money just to go " Hmmm-it 's not very good . " Or not good enough . So we 'll just wait . Right now , people are lovin ' going to our shows . And we 're lovin ' playing them . There 's no rush .

" Sidebar A Primo Pixies Primer Well , looks like you 're gon na have to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six albums Come Qn Pilgrim ( 1987 ) This 8-song EP remains a deeply unsettling calling card from a band whose bleak humor and devilishly warped sensibilities both blindsided and stunned music fans . Prime cut : " I 've Been Tired , " which Black calls one of his few songs of " attempted sincerity . " Surfer Rosa ( 1988 ) Engineered by indie-rock provocateur Steve Albini , this is arguably the Pixies watershed , with the howling , slashing " Bone Machine " and the Deal-sung race-mixing anthem " Gigantic . " Doolittle ( 1989 ) Producer Gil Norton gussied this up with a provisionally more mainstream sheen , but the Pixies mischief is in full effect . Anthems for the ages include " Debaser , " " Here Comes Your Man , " " Wave of Mutilation , " and the majestic " Monkey Gone to Heaven . " Bossanova ( 1990 ) Kicking off with a faux-surf instrumental , this hopscotches dizzyingly between the raucous ( the aptly named " Rock Music " ) and the lyrical ( " Velouria " ) , marrying both approaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Trompe le Monde ( 1991 ) What with all the shred-happy guitar heroics from Santiago , this at first sounds like a calculated attempt to become a more radio-friendly modern-rock act . Yet the bludgeoning riffage ( check " U-Mass " ) hits the spot , and the worldview is as twisted as ever . Wave of Mutilation : Best of Pixies ( 2004 ) Do n't wan na commit to the entire Pixies oeuvre ? That 's what best-ofs like this are made for , pilgrim . This one contains most of their choicest cuts , and ineludes some cool B-side-type rarities , like the fan favorite " Into the White . " But even obsessives should pick this up if only for the chilly cover of Neil Young 's " Winterlong . " Sidebar Pixie Dusted You 've heard it before , and you 're hearing itagain . The band influenced a buttload of other seminal acts . So what do they think about that ? The Pixies are credited with influencing dozens of bands who came after them ( everyone from Placebo to Pavement ) - but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the wrong guy to notice bands indebted to the Pixies because I do n't really listen to a lot of contemporary music , " he says . " I 've got this mantra : I do n't listen to modern music . I listen to old stuff . A lot of ' ' 60s . " Some other Pixies tastes are a fad more contemporary-by a decade or so . " Rush is my favorite band , " declares David Lovering . " I flew to Vegas three weeks ago and met Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson , and they said they loved the Pixies ! Tears were in my eyes ! " For their part , Deal and Santiago express something approaching humility when they discern echoes of their sound in other people 's music . " I hear our influence via the Nirvana thing , " says Deal . " Other bands started biting heavily on some of the little teeny elements Nirvana copped from us , so I heard a little bit of us , as cousins , in a lot of the early- ' ' 90s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like us . Nirvana sounded like Nirvana . " " The weirdest one is Radiohead , " says Santiago . " People say they sound like us . And I just go , " Nah , I do n't hear it . Those guys are good . ' ' " But some bands actually boast about their Pixies fixation . " We were at a party , and Weezer 's drummer , Pat Wilson , was there , " says Santiago . " And my wife asks him , " Have you ever toured together with the Pixies ? ' And Pat goes , " Ah , nah . We do n't tour with them . We just rip them off .
