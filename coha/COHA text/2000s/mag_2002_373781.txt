It Was So Much Safer in Eden <P> In what could be considered " The Fall of Man : The Sequel , " a priceless marble statue of ADAM tumbled off its pedestal at the Metropolitan Museum of Art . Created by Venetian sculptor Tullio Lombardo between 1490 and 1495 , the 6-ft. 3-in. , 1,800-lb. statue broke into several pieces , with the arms and legs sustaining particularly bad fractures . Curators have determined that the pedestal buckled of its own accord . The statue , which the Met acquired in 1936 , is expected to be restored and put back on display in two years , with evidence of the damage visible to only the most discerning eye . Adam seemed to take the tumble with aplomb : his hair , a solid mass of marble curls , remained unmussed . <P> JUST ANOTHER NATURALLY PRETTY FACE <P> Perhaps it was a pact with the devil or just impossibly advantageous genes , but MICHELLE PFEIFFER adamantly asserts that her enviable appearance owes nothing to plastic surgery . The clarification came after a comment made by PATRICIA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heaton , the co-star of Everybody Loves Raymond , joked to David Letterman about an actress currently on the cover of a magazine who said she was afraid of Botox , a comment Heaton said amused her because she had spoken to that actress 's plastic surgeon . As it happens , Pfeiffer is on the cover of Harper 's Bazaar and says she is afraid of Botox . After Pfeiffer reiterated that she is a natural woman , Heaton issued an apology , saying her comments were completely unfounded and Pfeiffer had " graciously accepted her apology .
