Amid much fanfare , President Bush reversed course and agreed to back an amendment  --  sponsored by Arizona Senator John McCain and , until recently , vehemently opposed by the White House  --  that would ban the torture of prisoners held by the U.S. anywhere in the world . But CIA spooks who interrogate terrorist suspects , such as alleged Sept. 11 plotter Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , may not need to don kid gloves just yet . U.S. officials conceded to TIME that the White House and McCain , a former Navy POW in Vietnam , made certain the amendment imposes no new penalties for any CIA operatives who violate the ban . " The McCain legislation does not create any new criminal liabilities , " Bush 's National Security Adviser , Stephen Hadley , said last week , characterizing it instead as " a very important statement of policy . " A McCain aide agreed with that interpretation . <P> At most , the measure may give the Justice Department new , if murky , grounds to enforce the long-standing ban on torture that some had argued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , McCain 's amendment to the Pentagon policy bill may end up making it more difficult to prosecute interrogators if they employ techniques green-lighted by government lawyers and thus can use " good-faith reliance on the advice of counsel " as a defense . <P> Former CIA general counsel Jeffrey Smith , a key torture-ban advocate , said it would be " deeply distressing " if the amendment is interpreted as toothless . Another sign that the U.S. is sending mixed messages on torture : a provision in the bill would allow military panels to assess information obtained through " coercion " when considering whether to continue holding an enemy combatant.
