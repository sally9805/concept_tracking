One thing I 've learned is that strange things do happen . They happen all the time . Today , for instance , my best friend Jill 's cat spoke . We were making brownies in the kitchen when we heard it say , Let me out . Well , we rushed to the back door and did exactly that . We experienced a miracle and now we 're looking for more , although Franconia , the town we live in , is not known for such things . Jill and I have known each other our whole lives . One house separates our houses but we act as if it does n't exist . We met before we were born and we 'll probably still know each other after we die . At least , that 's the way we 're planning it . My mother and I left for Atlantic City so quickly I did n't have time to call Jill . We told people we were on our way to visit an old aunt , but really our departure had something to do with love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't even exist . I know other people whose mothers suddenly pack up when their fathers drink or scream , but for us this is more serious . My mother does n't do things like go to Atlantic City . She does n't order room service and cry . She once told me that anyone who gets married had better like herself , because there 's nobody else in this world that she 'll ever really know , not truly . We stayed in our room in Atlantic City for three days , and did n't go outside once , thanks to room service . We ate like pigs and did n't even bother to brush our teeth until my mother 's cousin Margot , who got a divorce last summer and changed the color of her hair to give herself an emotional lift , came to get us . She drove to New Jersey in the Ford Mustang convertible that she refused to let her ex have , since he 'd taken her very soul and raked it over redhot coals . " Get dressed right now , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching an old cowboy movie , which , for some reason , made my mother cry . Maybe it was all those men on horseback who were so steadfast and loyal . Their own men had disappointed them , but somehow Margot and my mother both had hope for improvement . Frankly , I had more faith in the horses . " I mean now , Frances , " Margot said , and because she meant business , my mother actually dressed and put on some lipstick and we went to a Chinese restaurant where the drinks came with little paper umbrellas , which I kept as a souvenir . Listen to me , Gretel , Margot told me when we 'd gone back to the room to pack and my mother was finally out of earshot . When a marriage breaks up , it 's the children who suffer , so baby , hold on tight . That 's why Margot was relieved that she and Tony had never had children , although she became teary whenever she saw a baby . " Margot is my best friend , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered as we were throwing our suitcases into the trunk . " Take it all with a grain of salt . Maybe even a whole shaker . " Say what you want about the Mustang , it may be gorgeous , but it has very little trunk space . I had to sit in the back seat with the hair dryer and the makeup case on my lap all the way to Franconia , but that did n't stop me from keeping my fingers crossed and wishing we 'd wind up someplace other than home . We 're in Florida for one week , the week when the turtles die on the beach and there are jellyfish in the ocean . As soon as we checked into the hotel , my brother , Jason , who likes to pretend he 's not part of our family , went out to study tide pools and no one has seen him since . My parents are here to try to revitalize their marriage , which seems a pretty impossible feat to all outside observers . Gretel honey , do n't get high hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shopping for a bathing suit , a mission which can give anyone with a less than perfect body a complete nervous breakdown . When it 's over , it 's over , Margot told me , and I had the distinct feeling that she was right . Long before the plane touched down in Miami we could hear our parents arguing , and at the hotel they locked themselves in their room . If you ask me , working so hard at being married can backfire . It certainly is making my father nastier than usual . Not that his bad temper affects me . I keep my own counsel . I go my own way . I order room service and eat Linzer tortes and shrimp scampi alone in the room I was supposed to be sharing with Jason , not that he was ever planning to show up . Even though I was across the hall from my parents , I could still hear them fighting . I went out to the beach late , later than I 'd be allowed to if anyone knew I was alive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now in love with me . He is known as Jack Rabbit , which makes me laugh out loud . Does n't it figure that the boy who fell for me would be a rodent ? He lives in Atlanta and is in the ninth grade , and frankly he 's terribly boring . I let him kiss me once , but believe me , I did not hear bells . I only heard the jellyfish sloshing around in the water and the noisy beat of Jack Rabbit 's heart . Florida did n't do anything for my family , but at least it 's starting to be spring . Jill and I are keeping our eyes open for miracles . Jack Rabbit calls me constantly and that is something of a miracle . He writes so often you 'd think his fingers would start to cramp up . I bring his letters to school , so everyone is well aware that I have a boyfriend in Atlanta . They 'll never meet him . They 'll never know it 's actually possible for a boy to be so boring you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut up . I should get paid to listen to him when he calls on the phone . I should get a dollar fifty an hour . Minimum . Jill told me that when you 're really in love , you know right away . I 'm not exactly sure how this happens . Is it like a flash of lightning ? Like an angel tapping you on the shoulder ? Or is it similar to choosing a puppy ? You think you 're picking the cutest one , but really you wind up going home with the one who keeps insisting on climbing into your lap . That 's how we got our dog , Revolver . We thought he was so crazy about us , but it turned out that Labrador retrievers adore everyone . Well , maybe that 's what love is , a state of mind ready to grace anyone willing to accept it . Anyone who cares . School 's out . Hurray . Life , however , is still so boring that I 'm writing to Jack Rabbit every day . I go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until I think I 'm going blind , then jump into the deep end . We are not going on vacation because no one in my house is talking to each other , so going anywhere together is definitely out . My brother 's on the summer science team at the high school , so he 's never home . My father is on an exercise kick and has joined a gym , so he 's never around either . My mother and Margot and I spend a lot of time going to movies . It 's dark and it 's cool and no one knows if you 're crying , except for the person sitting directly beside you . Margot buys me anything I want , even Jordan almonds , which are so terrible for your teeth . She 's the kind of person who knows about love . She has men calling her in the middle of the night , but they 're all no good , or so she says . Just like Jill , she insists she 'll know when she meets the right man . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence is . I 'll just want to kiss him till I die . To me , this does n't sound like something to hope for , but people seem to hope for it all the same . Jill is camping with her parents , and has sent me a postcard that it has happened . The miracle we 've been searching for , the great event , the angel 's secret . It 's love , it really is . It 's the boy in the tent next to hers who she sneaks out to meet after her parents are asleep . I sit on my front stoop while Jill is away and think things over . I 've smartened up and am no longer waiting for the mailman . Jack Rabbit is n't writing anymore . He went to camp to be a junior counselor and I guess he broke his arm or fell in love with somebody new . Does n't it figure that I would miss his letters like crazy ? Sometimes I read the old ones late at night , and I wonder what was I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought he was boring ? Well , I 'm the boring one now . When Jill comes back I may have to lie to her . I may tell her Jack Rabbit died in a canoeing accident . My name was the last word he said , or so they tell me . My name brought him comfort with his last dying breath . Jill and I are not in the same class at school . We never are . The administration does n't want people who like each other to be together . They think it builds character when they stick people who hate one another in the same room , day after day , and nobody winds up getting killed or maimed . I 'm not supposed to know that Jill 's mother is seeing a psychiatrist , just as Jill is not supposed to know my parents are no longer sleeping in the same room . My mother spends her nights on a quilt on my floor , and she does n't cry until she thinks I 'm asleep . Recently , Margot and I went out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cream . Margot asked for my advice . She had spotted my father at an expensive restaurant , the kind he 'd never take us to , with some woman she 'd never seen before and she did n't know whether or not to tell my mother . I have never been much of a tattletale myself , although I understand that there are times when the truth serves its purpose . This did n't seem to be one of those times . For all we knew , this woman could be some business associate , although Margot and I probably would have both been willing to bet our lives that she was n't . Do n't tell . That was the advice I came up with . My mother was already crying and sleeping on the floor , what good would the truth do her now ? Margot did n't eat any of her sundae , and when she offered it to me I realized I was sick to my stomach . I think I 've pretty much figured out that in this world , it 's better to stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made ears out of felt which she glued to a plastic headband . She was a black cat . She had a tail that was braided out of three silk scarves . I borrowed thirty silver bangle bracelets from my grandmother . I was a fortune-teller . We should have suspected something when we saw the moon . It was orange and so big we could n't believe it . It was like we could take one big step , and there we 'd be : moon girls who had fallen off the rim of the world . My brother laughed at us . Were n't we a little too old for trick-or-treating ? Well of course we were , but we did n't care . We went up and down the block , collecting candy ; then we walked beyond the high school through the field so we could smoke cigarettes beside the creek . Jill had stolen the cigarettes from her mother 's purse , and I had gotten the matches from my grandmother . " As long as you 're not smoking cigarettes , " my grandmother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole thing . I could n't enjoy a single puff . Grandma Frieda was visiting for the weekend and she had the ability to put a hex on any form of high jinks . She was sleeping on my floor too , and it was getting pretty crowded there in my room . I could never find my sneakers . I could n't find my underwear . Every night , as I fell asleep , I 'd hear bits of whispered conversation , and every single one seemed to include the word sorrow . Jill had been practicing and knew how to blow smoke rings . She was blowing a misty ring when some guys from the high school intent on trouble approached . Jill looked older than she was , and even in costume , you could tell she was beautiful . The high school guys tried to kiss her , and when she refused , they grabbed her . The whole thing happened so fast I just sat there , as though I were the audience and the whole thing was a play . And then it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my silver bracelets were so heavy he fell backwards . The shock of me smashing one of them gave us time to run . We ran and ran , like we really could get to the moon if we had to . We ran until we turned into smoke ; we could float across lawns and drift under windows and doors . " I ca n't believe you did that , " Jill said when we finally made it home . She had lost her tail and her ears , but her face was shining . " You hit him . " I felt great for days . We do n't do holidays . We go to my grandma Frieda 's for Passover , but we skip Chanukah , which my father insists is trivial , and Thanksgiving , which he considers a meaningless ritual . We do , however , spend every Christmas at Margot 's house . It 's a holiday she feels entitled to celebrate since she was married to Tony Molinaro for all those years . My father never goes to Margot 's , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , and we decorated the tree with all of Tony 's mother 's beautiful old ornaments . There 's an angel that 's always been my favorite , fashioned out of silvery glass . When Tony 's mother was alive she assured me it would bring good luck to whoever hung it on the tree . Tony 's mother always preferred Margot to her own son , and when they broke up she took to her bed and was dead by the following spring . Even after Margot and Tony divorced , Margot always included her ex-mother-in-law in the festivities . Tony 's mother must have been at least ninety . Her hands shook as she held out the angel . " Here 's the thing about luck , " she told me on her last Christmas . " You do n't know if it 's good or bad until you have some perspective . " This year we made a toast to the old lady and Margot actually cried . Right as we finished the tree , snow started to fall . We all rushed to the front window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you hardly ever see , so heavy and beautiful you fall in love with winter , even though you know you 'll have to shovel in the morning . Margot had made a turkey with stuffing , a noodle kugel , and a white cake topped with coconut that looked like the snow outside . After dinner , she and my mother put on aprons and did the dishes and laughed . I let them listen to Elvis 's Blue Christmas ; I hardly ever saw my mother having a good time , so how could I complain ? In Jill 's family Christmas was a big deal , and I knew when I went over to her house in the morning she 'd have a dozen great presents to show me and I 'd have to try not to be jealous . Jill and I had given each other bottles of White Musk , our favorite scent . I envied Jill just about everything , but I did n't feel jealous right then , listening to Elvis in Margot 's house . Truthfully , there was nowhere else I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the corner from us . Her house was our house , and vice versa , unless my father was at home . Margot and my mother intended to be neighbors forever ; they had dozens of plans , but not all of their plans were working out . I 'd overheard my father talking on the phone . He was intending to leave as soon as the weather got better . As soon as he could break the news to us , he 'd be gone . He was in a holding pattern , that 's what he said , but he was n't holding on to us , that much was certain . I did n't tell my mother what I 'd learned . I did n't tell anyone . I wanted to see Margot and my mother dance in the kitchen when the dishes were done and drying on the rack . I wanted to see them throw their aprons on the floor . That night , when we walked home , my mother put her arm around me and told me to wish on a star . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there in the snow , and try as I might , I did n't see a single star . But I lied . I said that I did , and I wished anyway . We stood there while my mother tried in vain to see that same star . My fingers were freezing , so I put my hands in my pockets . The angel was there . I knew that if I tried to thank Margot , she 'd tell me to cut it out , she 'd say it was nothing , but it was definitely something to me . It was late , but we could hear traffic on the Southern State Parkway , even though it was Christmas , and snowing so hard . You had to wonder who all these people in their cars were leaving behind and who they were driving toward , and if they knew that in the distance , the echo of their tires on the asphalt sounded like a river , and that to someone like me , it could seem like the miracle I 'd been looking for .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
