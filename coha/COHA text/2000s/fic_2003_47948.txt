Sarah was nine-about-to-be-ten . The world was taking its sweet time . And she was in the world . It was Easter , but it was also Fast Sunday , because Easter had fallen on the first Sunday of the month this year , so all the meetings were in a row , Sunday school , then fast and testimony meeting , which was always longer than regular sacrament meeting , because people could get up and talk as long as they wanted , as long as the spirit moved them . Some year Easter would fall on her birthday , her mother had told her , it had when she was five , but this year her birthday would be two weeks after Easter . Because it was Fast Sunday , Sarah and her brothers could not eat any of the candy in their Easter baskets until after dark . On Fast Sundays , they had to fast from nightfall on Saturday to nightfall on Sunday . This was one of the commandments . Not one of the Ten Commandments , but one of the other ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the Word of Wisdom : Thou shalt run and not be weary , and walk and not faint . <p> But when she did n't eat for a whole day , she felt faint . And her head hurt . The only thing that would pass her lips all day was the sacrament-a little piece of torn-up Wonder bread , followed by a tiny fluted paper cup of water , like the ones they had at the dentist 's office-passed hand to hand down the pews by the deacons on metal trays after the priests had blessed them : That they may have His spirit to be with them . The priests seemed old to her , though they were only sixteen , and the deacons were twelve . They joked outside on the steps after church , but when they were passing the sacrament , they were serious . Girls could n't be deacons or priests or elders or anything but mothers and primary or Sunday school or MIA or Relief Society teachers . When boys turned twelve , they received the priesthood . Then the boys and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boys would go to early morning priesthood meetings . <p> Sarah imagined receiving the priesthood must be something like receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost , but the priesthood was conferred in secret . Only the men could see . The day after she was baptized , nearly two years ago , she had been blessed in front of the whole congregation , along with the other children who had turned eight in the past month and a few converts , who always seemed strange and too large next to the children . What would it have been like not to have been born into the church ? she wondered . She felt the converts were lucky the missionaries had found them in time . Both her mother and her father had been missionaries , her father in Scotland and her mother in Mexico . It was the only time either of them had ever traveled outside the United States . The onyx bookends in the living room had come from Mexico ; the sheepskin rug in her parents ' bedroom had come from Scotland . Her father sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother taught her and her brothers Spanish . Me llamo Sarah . Yo soy una hija de Dios . <p> " Remember who you are : you are a child of God , " her parents said repeatedly , when she left for school in the morning , when she went to a friend 's house to play , when she asked why she could n't do something she wanted to do . <p> " Thank you for that lovely prelude , Sister Erickson . And now , Brother Meredith , President of the Quorum of Seventies , will lead us in the opening prayer , following which we will sing hymn #194 , ' There Is a Green Hill Faraway . ' " <p> Bishop Anderson was presiding at fast and testimony meeting . Sarah always thought he looked slightly uncomfortable when he was wearing a suit and tie . His wrists hung down below his shirt cuffs . During the week , he worked as an electrician , and he always wore blue coveralls with his name , Don Anderson , in red curlicue script on his left pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crew-cut . Usually , bishops were doctors or dentists or businessmen , but everyone said that Bishop Anderson was truly a man of the spirit . <p> " Heavenly Father , " prayed Brother Meredith , " we are grateful to be gathered here in Thy name today in this beautiful house of worship which Thou hast provided for us . We ask that Thou wilt bless us and guide us in the path of righteousness . Bless those who will speak to us today that their mouths will be filled with Thy holy presence . In the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Ghost , Amen . " <p> " Amen , " echoed Sarah with the rest of the congregation . <p> Two years ago , when her father and the other elders and high priests had stood in a circle around her and put their hands on her head to confirm her and give her the gift of the Holy Ghost , Sarah had expected that she would feel the Holy Ghost enter her body , that it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like holding her breath too long underwater . She expected that she would feel something or see something , the way she assumed , the first time she crossed the state border from Utah into Nevada , that the states would be different colors the way they were on a map . When nothing had changed colors , when the road and the salt flats and the sagebrush looked exactly the same on one side of the state line as the other , Sarah could n't help exclaiming , " Nevada 's the same color as Utah . " <p> " Oh , it 's a little different , " her father had said , " you 'll see . " <p> But it was n't , just more sand and more road and maybe hotter . On one trip across Nevada , though , they saw a giant cloud billow up in the distance . The air was full of brilliant particles , like dust , only it was n't dust . <p> " It 's pretty , " said her brother Drew , uncharacteristically . Usually , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to notice what was outside the car . " It 's like Tinkerbell or angels . " <p> " It 's the Test Site , " said her father . " Like Hiroshima , only in the desert , where there are no people . It 's so we wo n't have war ever again . " <p> This was also the day that Drew would be confirmed . As always , for Easter , her mother had stayed up all night finishing the matching outfits she made for herself and Sarah and her brothers . Dresses for her mother and Sarah , shirts for the three boys , all made out of the same material . This year the cloth was an orange-and-brown plaid , which really did n't seem like Easter colors , more like fall . Sarah knew that it must have been one of the only fabrics inexpensive enough and with enough material left on the bolt for two dresses and four shirts . Only her father , in his blue suit and maroon tie with squiggles on it , did n't match . She had thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year , since she 'd been sick so long . But when Sarah and Drew and Danny and Tyler woke up early to look for their Easter baskets , even though they knew they would n't be able to eat anything from them , they found the row of clothes laid out on the back of the couch from left to right , from biggest ( Sarah ) to smallest ( Tyler ) , just the way they always were , so Sarah knew she could n't say anything about not liking the color of the fabric . Or the pattern-it was too babyish ; her mother had used the same pattern last year , just made it a little bigger . Sarah felt she was too old for puffed sleeves and rickrack . <p> Now , sitting on the pew between her mother and Danny , with Tyler on the other side of her mother , she watched Drew . He was up on the dais in the choir seats with the four other children who were about to be confirmed . Her father was also on the dais @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrament table , but like it . He was the ward clerk now ; he had to write everything down that was said in the meeting . Sarah knew he did n't like it , even though he had been ordained . <p> " Why was I called to this position ? " he asked their mother frequently . " Why ca n't I be the Gospel Doctrine teacher ? " <p> " This , too , shall pass , " her mother always said . <p> She wondered if Drew would feel something when they gave him the gift of the Holy Ghost . He was a little afraid of it , she could tell . Now he would have to be good , because he had reached the age of accountability . When you were eight , you knew the difference between right and wrong . That is why you were baptized then , and not when you were a baby . She remembered how the bishop asked her , right before she was baptized , if she knew that she would be making a solemn covenant between herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she knew with all her heart . But she had always been good ; Drew had not . He talked back , and had his mouth washed out with soap . She had had her mouth washed out with soap once , and that was enough . Now she would bite her cheek so she would n't say a bad thing , but Drew would say it . He was proud of saying bad words and said he liked the taste of Ivory soap . Sometimes when their parents were n't there , he would bite off a tiny piece , fill his mouth with water , and spit small bubbles at her . <p> Sacrament was over . The priests folded the white lace tablecloth over the trays , and moved down to sit with the rest of the congregation . Bishop Anderson got up to say a few words . There were two babies to be blessed , before the five gifts of the Holy Ghost , so it would be a long time before the testimonies even started . This is not what Bishop Anderson said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long Fast Sunday , not a short Fast Sunday . He said not to forget the Relief Society bazaar and potluck supper next Saturday night . He said that he hoped our special prayers would be with Sister Nelson , who had broken her hip after a fall . <p> Sister Nelson usually led the choir . She had dark black hair with one thick white stripe in it , starting at her forehead and going all the way down the back of her head . Sarah 's mother said it was a widow 's peak , but it looked like a skunk to Sarah , only the stripe was n't right in the center the way a skunk 's would be . Sister Nelson had been kind to Sarah , though ; she gave her a book after she was baptized . And it was n't even a religious book , like the other ones she got , her own leather-bound copy of the Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants and The Pearl of Great Price , a triple combination , or a three-in-one , it was called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sewing machine . Sister Nelson had given her Five Children and It . Sarah had tried some of the spells . The one that was most successful was the one where , before you went to sleep , you concentrated really hard , and banged your head on the pillow the number of times for the hour you wanted to wake up-six for six o'clock , seven for seven o'clock . It always worked . She wanted to be like the children in English storybooks , having adventures all day in the hedgerows-she imagined the hedgerows as being a little like the tunnel she and her cousins made through the honeysuckle bushes in Grandma Hart 's garden-and drinking ginger beer . She did n't know what ginger beer was , but it probably was n't allowed , the way Coca-Cola was n't allowed . Latter-day Saints could have root beer , though . Sometimes , after all six of them piled in the station wagon and before they would go to the drive-in movie , they would go to the Arctic Circle and have root beer floats . <p> Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought about food . It was bad to think about food on Fast Sunday , not bad because it was n't allowed , but bad because it would be too hard to get through the whole day without eating if she thought about food . On regular Sundays , they would have a big meal between Sunday school and sacrament meeting . Her mother would start a pot roast or a stewed chicken cooking before Sunday school , then they would smell it first thing when they got in the door after church . Tyler did n't have to fast , because he was only two . But when it was Fast Sunday , even he could n't have the dry Cheerios her mother would usually bring to church to keep him quiet . Her mother had given Tyler her handkerchief to fuss with instead . He was playing peek-a-boo with Sister Holmgren in the pew behind them . Sister Holmgren had seven children , but they were all grown-up now and had children of their own . <p> The babies had been brought up to the front of the chapel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bounced in the men 's arms , but often cried when they were given back to their mothers , Sarah noticed-and now it was almost Drew 's turn to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost . Today , because it was Easter besides Fast Sunday , there were flowers in the chapel , white trumpet-shaped blossoms on tall green stems . They smelled the way Sarah imagined the Celestial Kingdom must smell . They looked the same as the flowers in one of the picture books she had seen at Grandma Hart 's house , a big book with gold on the edges of the pages . The flowers were in a blue vase on a checkerboard floor between Mary-her grandmother said it was **28;1534;TOOLONG an angel , with wings , though everyone knew angels did n't have wings . <p> Sarah wished there were flowers in the chapel all the time , not just Easter and Christmas and missionary farewells and funerals . In the church she went to once with her friend Emma , called St. Sebastian 's , there were flowers everywhere and paintings and colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candlesticks and pink velvet cushions on the seats and a smell of something burning , but sweet , and , most surprising of all , a huge wooden cross with Jesus nailed on it at the front of the church . Sarah could n't stop looking at it . It was scary , but beautiful , too . Jesus did n't look unhappy ; he looked peaceful . When she asked her mother about it later , her mother said Latter-day Saints were n't allowed to have crosses in their churches or to wear crosses , because it reminded them of the bad part of Jesus ' life , and that they wanted to think of the good part , when Jesus rises out of the tomb and says , I am the resurrection and the light . <p> Latter-day Saints were n't supposed to go inside other people 's churches , either , but her mother had let her go , just that once . She wished she could go there again ; there were so many more things to look at there than in their own chapel , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on them , and frosted-glass windows you could n't see through , like the ones in bathrooms , so you could n't even see whether it had started to rain . Outside she knew the apricot trees were in blossom . I looked out the window and what did I see : popcorn popping on the apricot tree . Val Verda , the neighborhood where they lived , used to be all orchards , no houses , her father had told her . <p> The only thing she could do when she got bored at her church meetings was to play with the hymnbook . She knew practically all the hymns by heart . She would make up new words to some of them . Cherries hurt you instead of Cherish virtue . God be with you till we eat again instead of God be with you till we meet again . She especially liked it if they sang that one on Fast Sunday , but today unfortunately they would n't . Today the closing hymn would be #136 , " I Know That My Redeemer Lives . " The numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little wooden board above her father 's head . He was bent over , writing , writing , writing . He had to write down the names of everyone who was in church that day and everything that happened . Sarah wondered what happened to the black notebooks after they were full . Did they keep them in a vault somewhere ? In a temple , maybe ? Were they to give to God when the millennium came ? But did n't He know everything already ? Why did it have to be written down ? <p> " Heavenly Father , " Brother Wickham 's voice boomed out . His prayers were always louder than anyone else 's , and he was praying over his own daughter , Karen , so he was especially loud . Sister Spackman said that man 's voice would reach all the way to heaven . Karen stood up after the blessing and adjusted the sash on her pink , embroidered , store-bought dress . Brother Wickham was a doctor , and Sister Wickham did n't have to make her own or Karen 's clothes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come down and join the circle of men . Her father prayed " that the spirit of the Holy Ghost might guide Drew and direct him in all his endeavors throughout his life , that the still , small voice would stay his hand from evil . In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost , Amen . " <p> " Amen , " the men in the circle repeated and took their hands off Drew 's head . Sarah remembered that when the hands had been lifted off her head , she felt as if she might float up , the way if you pressed the backs of your hands against a door frame for long enough , when you stepped away your hands would rise up , magically , by themselves , sometimes even above your head . Drew looked a little stunned as he climbed back up on the dais . <p> Two more confirmations followed , then finally the testimonies began . Some people bore their testimonies every single Fast Sunday . Sarah almost knew by heart what Sister Spackman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say when she got up : " I 'm grateful for the church and my family and for the strength to live each day and to be a witness for the truth of the gospel . " Sister Spackman was a widow , and her youngest son had a disease . He would always stay a child . He could n't hold the priesthood , even though he was already old enough to be a deacon . <p> Sarah hoped her parents would n't bear their testimonies this time . They had gotten up often in the months since her mother had had her operation . The Fast Sunday after her mother had come home from the hospital , even Sarah had risen to say that she knew the church was true and that Joseph Smith was a prophet and that she was grateful her prayers had been answered and that her mother was back home . She was still frightened , though , that her mother would not be all right . Sarah found it harder to pray now , harder to have faith the way she was supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her anymore , that maybe He was looking at her , and that He did n't like what He saw . <p> Sarah 's mother was still weak ; her father did all the grocery shopping , and Sarah did most of the cooking and ironing . That was why it was so surprising that her mother had made their Easter clothes this year . Her mother looked very tired ; the skin around her mouth seemed yellowish next to the red lipstick . Sarah glanced over at the bodice of her mother 's dress . You could n't tell with her clothes on . She had let Sarah hold the pad that she slipped into her bra every morning . It was surprisingly heavy . She had also shown Sarah the two long red scars , and let her touch them so she would n't be frightened . One started at her left armpit , curved across her chest and down almost all the way to her navel ; the other started at her navel and went straight down her whole belly . The scars were flat and wide and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Her mother would have sewn herself up more neatly than the doctors did , thought Sarah . Her mother was such a good seamstress that she even made wedding dresses and Temple clothes . She had taught Sarah how to sew , too , and embroider . Sarah made a cross-stitched sampler that read " I will bring the light of the gospel into my home . " Her mother had taught her how to make lots of different kinds of stitches : tacking stitch , basting stitch , running stitch , overhand stitch , blind stitch , hem stitch , seed stitch , pearl stitch , invisible stitch . <p> Sarah 's mother was even thinner now than she used to be . She could n't have any more children , she had told Sarah . She had wanted to have twelve , like her friend , Sister Barber , who was Mrs. Utah one year . Sarah could n't imagine more children-three brothers were enough-though it would have been nice to have had a sister . A sister could have helped with the cooking and dishwashing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself . She could have had secrets with a sister ; they could have slept in the same bed together , the way Drew and Danny did . And when they grew up , they could go on double dates together and marry brothers , the way Annie and Abby Holmgren had . They even had their first babies at the same time . <p> The church was suddenly quiet . Sarah looked up . Sister Spackman had finished her testimony and sat down . A man she had seen only a few times at church was walking up the aisle . Most people just stood up to speak from where they were sitting , but some people came up to the podium on the dais . The man was tall , and had wavy brown hair and blue eyes . He looked a little bit like her oldest cousin , Shep , who was on a mission in Brazil , but he was older than Shep . This man was old enough to be a father , but as far as Sarah knew , he did n't have a wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him , and he always had left quickly after sacrament meeting , not standing around shaking hands after the service , the way the other men did . Since he had never spoken before in church , Sarah was curious . Maybe he would say something about his wife and children . Maybe they had all died in a fire . People talked about things like that in fast and testimony meeting . Sarah did n't always understand what people meant when they spoke , but usually her mother would explain things later , like when Brother Watkins moved out of his house for six months , leaving Sister Watkins and their five children behind . When he came back , he repented in front of the whole congregation . <p> " Brothers and sisters , " the man began , his hands gripping the edges of the podium , " most of you do n't know me . I have only lived in this ward for a few months . My name is John Perry . I was born in Moscow , Idaho . My great-great-grandfather Perry crossed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England during the early days of the church . " <p> This was like Sarah 's family and most of the people she knew . She wondered if he was going to tell his whole genealogy . She knew , though no one would say much about it , that her great-grandfather on her mother 's side had been a polygamist . When relatives did talk about it , they called it " living the principle . " Her great-grandfather had only three wives , though . Not nearly as many as Brigham Young . But because of polygamy , Sarah did seem to have a lot of relatives , the usual aunts and uncles and cousins , but also great-aunts once removed , second cousins twice removed , and honorary uncles . <p> " I was raised in the church , went to Ricks College for a year , then served my mission in the Netherlands . After I returned from my mission , I went to BYU and completed my degree in business administration . Then I married my high school sweetheart in the Temple , for Time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we prospered in the Lord and were blessed with three fine children . " <p> So far , this still sounded like the story of almost every other grown-up . But then he said something Sarah did n't expect . <p> " I fell in love with another woman . My wife cast me out . That is why I came back here , to Bountiful , to the heart of the church . Because here , I thought , I would find kindred souls , as it is written in Helaman , Chapter 5 , Verse 14 : And they did remember his words ; and therefore they went forth , keeping the commandments of God , to teach the word of God among all the people of Nephi , beginning at the city of Bountiful . I 've been watching you , in the short time I 've lived in this ward , and I decided that today would be the day to tell you what I was brought to this earth to accomplish . " <p> Bountiful , Sarah thought . She had never connected her Bountiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mormon . Sarah felt her mother stir beside her . She saw her father lift his pen from the record book and look more closely at the man on the podium . Drew was putting rabbit ears behind Karen Wickham 's head , so maybe he had n't changed too much yet . <p> " Brothers and sisters , " Brother Perry continued , " Straight is the way and narrow the gate that leads to the Kingdom of Heaven . I believe that the church has taken a wrong turn on the path . I believe in the continuing power of revelation , and God has revealed to me that we should return to the old covenant , that men should take unto themselves more wives , that we should prepare to enter the Celestial Kingdom as God has planned by giving as many souls as possible their mortal bodies . I have seen all those spirits waiting in the preexistence , waiting to receive their terrestrial bodies , and God has told me that we must make more bodies , soon , before the millennium . It 's time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts . We are the Chosen People , and we can not allow only the Gentiles to populate this terrestrial plane . Every man and every woman of childbearing age must join together to make new temples to house the spirits waiting in the preexistence . " <p> My body is a temple , Sarah thought . That was in a song she had learned when she was very little . My body is a temple . How could a body be a building ? What about her mother-did the operation mean her mother 's body could n't be a temple anymore ? What if her father decided to marry someone else ? Her mother was clasping her hand tightly now , and Sarah , in turn , had taken Danny 's hand on her left . <p> The man paused for a moment . Members of the congregation started to murmur and look at each other . Sarah noticed that Bishop Anderson was whispering to Brother Jenson , the first counselor , sitting on his right . " Sarah , " her mother said , " maybe you should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He might be bearing false witness . " But Sarah had to listen , just the way she had to read everything in the World Book and all the biographies of composers in the library . Maybe he would say something that would help her make sense of what had happened to her mother , even though her mother was so very good . <p> " Brothers and sisters , I ask you to remember with me the tidings of 3 Nephi 11:1 : And now it came to pass that there were a great multitude gathered together of the people of Nephi , round about the temple which was in the land Bountiful ; and they were marveling and wondering one with another , and were showing one to another the great and marvelous changes which had taken place . We have the opportunity now , in Bountiful , to fulfill our great spiritual destiny , to come and be numbered with the house of Israel . I have chosen you to join with me and restore the principle we are meant to follow . All those of you who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . Come follow me into the hills of Zion , and we will start a new era of brotherly and sisterly love . Come follow me or be cast down into the pit of wickedness . " <p> The man stepped down from the dais and walked across the front of the chapel . He opened the door by the sacrament table , letting in the surprising blue light of the day , like the stone being rolled away from the tomb . He cupped his hands in front of him , like a picture Sarah had seen of Jesus speaking to the disciples . " Come follow me , " he said one last time , and stepped outside . <p> No one moved . <p> Finally , Bishop Anderson got up . He said , " And now , brothers and sisters , difficult as it is , we must act . As we know from 1 Nephi 22:19 , all who fight against Zion shall be cut off , and from Moroni 6:7 , the names of the unrighteous are blotted out . We must never speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will be cut off temporally and spiritually from the presence of God . And it is our duty as followers of the gospel and members of the true church to excommunicate him . After the close of testimony meeting , I ask all the elders , seventies , and high priests to meet with me in a special priesthood meeting . But now it is even more important than ever for us to continue to bear our testimonies . " <p> Bishop Anderson bore his , then one by one , almost all the members of the congregation stood up to bear theirs . When Sarah 's mother rose , she said , " I know I was put on this earth for a special purpose , and , even though my strength has been tested by illness , I love the gospel more than ever . I know this church is true and that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God and that we are guided today by a prophet , seer , and revelator . " <p> Even Drew and Danny got up to speak . Drew sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been baptized into the true church and to have received the gift of the Holy Ghost . He even recited part of a hymn , " The witness of the Holy Ghost , /As borne by those who know , /Has lifted me again to thee , /O Father of my soul . " Danny simply said he was thankful for his family and glad that it was Easter . <p> But Sarah felt something hard inside herself , as if she had accidentally swallowed the pit of an apricot . Why could n't she stand up like everyone else to bear her testimony ? It was Easter , the holiest day of the year . Where were the words that used to come so easily ? <p> It was dark by the time everyone finished speaking and sang the final hymn ; one of the lines , " He lives my hungry soul to feed , " leapt out at Sarah . On a normal Fast Sunday , she and Drew might have repeated that line over and over instead of singing the rest of the hymn , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever-living Head " but now she sang straight through , without changing any words , and it looked like Drew was singing his heart out on the dais . <p> After the final amen after the final prayer , Sarah rushed outside . She knew that the women would stand in the foyer and talk while the men gathered in the gospel doctrine room for the special priesthood meeting . Her mother would probably ask Sister Holmgren for a ride home , since the men might meet for hours more . Sarah wanted to see if John Perry was still around . She walked to the edge of the parking lot . Along with the scent of apricot blossoms , she could smell a faint tang of smoke from the oil refineries next to the Great Salt Lake . Down in the valley , she could see the chain of lights from Slim Olson 's , the huge gas station where her father was a bookkeeper . Even in the dark , she could see the sheen of the white screen of the drive-in movie , which had n't yet opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So she walked back toward the chapel . By the side of a red pickup truck , she saw him . No one else was near . She wanted to say something to him , but she did n't know what . She wanted to ask him if he knew whether her mother would ever get well again . As she walked closer , she could see he was crying . She pulled her new Easter handkerchief out of her patent-leather purse . Without a word , she gave it to him . He looked down at her . " You believe me , do n't you , " he said in a soft voice . " You 'll know I 'm right when you get older . I can see that ; I can see you 're a thoughtful child . " <p> " Good luck , " Sarah said , but that did n't seem quite enough , so she added , " God bless , " then turned away . She knew her mother would be looking for her by now , or wondering if she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When she saw her mother in the foyer with Sister Holmgren , Sarah ran towards her , but stopped before hugging her . She was afraid her mother , so thin already , would dissolve at her touch . She knew she would never be able to tell her parents about seeing John Perry outside the chapel . <p> Sarah and her mother and brothers rode home in Sister Holmgren 's big car . Drew got in the middle of the back seat right away , without even fighting Sarah for a window seat . Sarah opened the window a crack so she could smell the blossoming trees . She was hungry , so hungry , and she felt that she occupied a very small corner in the world , a corner into which no hands could reach to comfort her . <p>
