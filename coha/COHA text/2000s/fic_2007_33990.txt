Chapter One The buck fell with the first shot , and Zach Emory could n't help being impressed with himself . From his deer stand , it looked like an eight- or ten-pointer . If the weather stayed cold , he 'd be able to make it last for several weeks ' worth of meals . He climbed down from his deer stand and pulled up the collar of his jacket . It was so cold his ears were numb , and his fingers had begun to ache . But it was worth it . Even in the pre-outage days , Zach had spent many mornings sitting in a deer stand freezing to death , just for sport . Now it was a matter of survival . He jogged toward the animal that lay dead twenty yards away . His brother Gary would be crazy with envy . They had a competition going , and Gary was two up on him . Zach hoped Gary had heard the gunshot and would come to help him move the deer . It would take both of them to lift it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ten points . And a perfect shot right through the heart . His dad would finally be proud , and if he was lucky , his mother would drag herself out of bed to get a look . He heard footsteps behind him and turned to see a man emerging from the trees , walking toward him . Zach squinted , trying to place him . He 'd seen him before , but he could n't remember where . " Did I score or what ? " he asked as the man came closer . " He 's a ten-pointer . Got him in one shot , right throughthe ticker ! " The man did n't look like he 'd come to celebrate . He stopped about thirty feet away ... and raised his rifle . Was he going to shoot ? Zach 's hands came up , as if that would stop him . The gun fired - its impact propelling Zach backward , bouncing him onto the dirt . Chapter Two The building smelled of motor oil and grease - a scent Deni Branning associated with progress . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she rolled her bike inside . Oh , for the days of noise pollution and hurry - of bumper-to-bumper traffic , honking horns , blaring radios , and twenty-four-hour TV . All over the large warehouse , mechanics and engineers with black-stained fingers worked at converting engines . The building had been purchased by the feds a few months ago , when they instituted the draft . Instead of drafting soldiers , the government had conscripted all of those with experience as mechanics . Later , they 'd added others to the conscription list : electricians , scientists , and engineers . Many of them were allowed to live at home and work in the local conversion plants , but others had been sent across the country to serve where they were needed . Pushing down the kickstand on her bike , she reached into her bag for her notepad and looked around for someone in charge . She saw Ned Emory , from her neighborhood , standing nearby with a clipboard , instructing a group of mechanics with a disassembled engine laid out in front of them . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yelled over the noise . " Mr. Emory ? " He turned . " Yeah ? " She could see that he did n't recognize her , even though his son Zach had been close friends with her brother for years . " Deni Branning . Jeff 's sister ? " Recognition dawned in his eyes . She reached out to shake hands with him , but he showed her his greasy hands . " Better not shake . What brings you here ? " " I 'm writing an article about your work here . Do you have time for an interview ? " As if he had n't heard her , he turned back to the men , barked out some orders that she could n't hear , and started walking away . Glancing back over his shoulder , he said , " I heard the newspaper is back up and running . They hired you , did they ? " She caught up to him and tried to match his steps . " That 's right . the Crockett Times . They liked what I 'd been doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cover story for next week 's issue . " He did n't seem impressed , so she pulled out her big guns . " You guys are like rock stars . Everybody wants to know what you 're up to . " Pride pulled at the corners of his mouth , and she knew she 'd struck a chord . " Sure , I can give you a few minutes . What do you want to know ? " He started up a staircase , and she blew out her frustration as she followed him . " Is there someplace we can sit down ? " " I do n't have time to sit down . " He reached the top of the stairs and headed across the concrete floor to an area where a dozen mopeds sat in various stages of completion . " Hey , Stark ! I need at least four of these done by the end of the day . Get Bennett over here to help you . " Deni 's gaze swept over the bikes . " Wow . How can I get one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not for the private sector . " He was walking again , but she hung back , unable to tear herself away from the coveted mopeds . She stepped toward one and touched the seat . He turned back and gave her an impatient look . " Do you want to do the interview or not ? " She shook off her longing and forced herself to focus . " Of course . " He led her past a table filled with generators , and again , her longing kicked in . " Do those work ? " " They do after we harden them against the Pulses . " Her heart quickened . If they were making hardened generators here , it would n't be long until they actually had electricity . Could there really be lightbulbs at the end of the tunnel ? " When will those be available for the public ? " she asked , catching up to him again . " Our illustrious supernova will burn out before we can finish supplying the hospitals . They 're priority number one for the generators right now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter - we have to do everything by hand , one at a time . And even if we could produce enough for the public , there 's one missing ingredient . " " Gasoline , " she said . " You got it . " He reached a series of offices with glass walls , overlooking the work on the floor below them . " We ca n't get enough gas without operating tanker trucks , and once we get it here , we do n't have electricity to work the pumps . " She was well aware of the chain of problems . " But are n't you guys all about creating work-arounds ? " " Right now we 're just trying to help critical ser vices operate . Like I said , the star will likely burn out before we get caught up with that . Then we 'll shift our objectives from sustaining to rebuilding . " He headed into one of the offices , dropped his clipboard on his desk , and motioned for her to take a seat . As Deni sat down , something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to follow his gaze . Someone was running up the stairs . Ned frowned as his son Gary came running toward his door . " Dad , Zach 's been shot ! " " What ? " Deni caught her breath and got to her feet . " We were hunting at the Jenkins 's place . I heard some gunshots and ... when I found him ... " " Is he dead ? " Ned blurted out . " I do n't think so . I got help and somebody went to get an ambulance . They 're taking him to University Hospital . " Ned grabbed his son 's shoulders . " What condition was he in when they took him ? " Gary trembled as he raked his hands through his hair . " There was blood all over his shirt ... front and back . " Deni 's heart stopped . Her brother 's best friend ... Ned raced out of the office and hurried down the stairs , Gary on his heels . Deni followed them as far as the top of the stairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All the engines went quiet , and everyone stared as Ned ran to a beat-up Buick . " The keys ! " he shouted . " Where are the keys ? " Someone tossed them to him , and he got in and started the engine . Gary jumped in beside him . Two guys pulled up the garage door and the Buick rumbled out . Deni muttered a prayer for Zach as they drove off - and then a thought struck her . Jeff , Deni 's brother , sometimes hunted with Zach . Could they have been together ? What if he 'd been hurt too ? She had to get to the scene of the shooting . She ran downstairs , grabbed her bike , and pedaled out behind them . (
