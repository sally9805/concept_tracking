Eleven-year-old Mikkel was not studying The History of the NordornLand as he had been instructed to do by his tutor . It was n't his fault ; he was distracted by the argument taking place just beyond the door of his outer chamber . " Please go somewhere else , " he called . " I 'm trying to read . " <p> Neither his older brother nor his sister deigned to answer . The least they could do , Mikkel thought , was to fight in one of their apartments or even the Great Hall . There were weapons in the Great Hall . Let them take up arms , settle the matter once and for all , and be done with it . <p> At another time , Mikkel would have been studying at the desk he and his tutor customarily occupied in the outer room , but even if Bjaudin and Elin had n't chosen that room for their latest battle , he had no real objection to moving to his inner chamber . The room was much cozier and he preferred it for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished it had been his choice . <p> At the moment , he was sprawled on his bed . He stuffed cotton wool in his ears , and , for good measure , covered them with his hands . He could still hear the two of them going at one another . <p> Why , he wondered , do they do that ? What have they to complain about ? Bjaudin held the title of NordornPrince ; he was next in line to become NordornKing , and , in fact , had assumed many of the duties of kingship . Elin , as NordornPrincess , was next in succession after Bjaudin . His eldest sister Hegrin , whom he seldom saw , was actually a queen ! Queen of Rendel she was , and turning out princes and princesses of her own . He , Mikkel , did n't have a title of any kind beyond the one he had been born with . His sole honor was that Father had knighted him last year . He could be called " Sir Mikkel " if he did n't care to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered what his title might be , if he had one . Duke of Obscurity , probably . <p> But there was no chance of even that crumb for him . There was n't any need for him to be granted a title , other than Extra Prince , the younger son of Gaurin Norborne King and Ashen NordornQueen , the one who had no real prospects other than a life of hanging around the Nordorn Court , playing King 's Soldiers and trying to stay out of trouble . Or , he thought wryly , to cause it . Like Elin was now doing with her clamor to be proclaimed heiress to the Duchy of Iselin . <p> " Granddam Ysa is n't going to live forever , " she was now arguing , forcefully enough that Mikkel could hear her clearly even through the cotton wool . " Iselin is a fair country-or would be , if Granddam would just care for it instead of only for herself-and it deserves to come into caring hands . All it would take is a word from you- " " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not for the first time . " Such a bestowal is Father 's to make , not mine . " <p> Mikkel could almost see his sister 's shrug in the dismissive tone of her voice . <p> " That 's only a formality . All you have to do is mention it to him and it will be done . " <p> " I see no reason to , " Bjaudin said , again not for the first time . <p> " Well , I 've told you , " Elin retorted . " Shall I tell you again ? " <p> Oh , no , Mikkel thought . He closed his book . Better to give up now and risk a caning from his tutor than stay and have to listen to the whole argument repeating itself . <p> He was saved by the arrival of Rolls , one of the senior house stewards . The signal bell atop the Water Tower had begun ringing . <p> " The Sea-Rover ships are entering the fjord , young master , " Rolls reported . " Your father and mother and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Thank you , Rolls , " Mikkel said , grateful to have a legitimate excuse to leave his studies . " I thought I heard the warning bell . Have you informed the Nordorn Prince and the Princess ? " <p> " I did on my way to you . " <p> Rolls bowed his way out of Mike 's inner chamber and , before he closed the door behind him , added , " There are four ships . " <p> Four ships when but two had been expected ! Mike 's day brightened immediately . Who could the others be carrying ? he wondered . There had been a report at dinner last evening that the newest addition to the Nordorn fleet was being delivered under escort and should very likely arrive today , but nothing had been said about a third vessel , let alone a fourth . <p> One , three , four , or a dozen , this prospect was infinitely more interesting than listening to another of Badin 's and Elfin 's interminable battles , or even reading the history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ashen Nordorn- Queen had , at great pain to themselves , rid the land of an Ice Dragon that was held to be virtually unkillable . <p> He swung himself off the bed and dashed out of his bedchamber , tossing the book ungently on his desk , and in the process disturbing the half-grown warkat that had been drowsing on a rug in front of the hearth . The warkat shook its ears vigorously , then got up and followed Mikkel down the stairway leading to the Great Hall , and thence to the cool , clean air outside the Castle of Fire and Ice . <p> " When did you become interested in ships , Talkin ? " Mikkel asked the warkat . " Or were you bored to tears with them , like me ? " He indicated the area where Bjaudin and Elin had been fighting . " Well , whatever it is , let 's go see what we can find . " <p> The young Prince and his companion reached the landing at the top of the stairs that led down the cliff to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Castle of Fire and Ice had a sizable population . Not only the Nordorn King and Nordorn Queen and their immediate family lived there , but also Uncle Einaar and Aunt Elibit , the Duke and Duchess of +ssfin and the NordornLand , even though they had fine estates outside Cyornasberg and a handsome manor house inside the city as well . Mikkel stifled an exclamation of displeasure ; Yngvar was with them , dressed in deep blue velvet , pale and slight and a total bore . For a moment , Mikkel regretted that he had n't changed into better clothing to greet the visitors , but the feeling passed as quickly as it had come . <p> Admiral-General Count Tordenskjold was , naturally , on the scene to receive his newest addition to the growing Nordorn navy . Count Svarteper of Rsttnos , Lord High Marshal and Protector of the NordornLand , stood beside the great Admiral-General , with the Countess Gyda at his side . Tordenskjold 's wife , Aud , was absent and Mikkel remembered that she had left Cyornasberg to be with their daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first grandchild at any moment . <p> Svarteper 's town residence was a part of the Castle of Fire and Ice , and Tordenskjold had an apartment set aside especially for him when business required his uninterrupted presence . <p> Other barons and counts came and went as they pleased , though this day it seemed that most of the Nordorn nobility had chosen to attend . Several had joined the crowd to watch the ships make the turn into the fjord . Mikkel recognized Count Baldrian of Westerblad and , a little to his surprise , Mjdulf of Mithlond and his wife , the Countess Ekla . Mjdulf almost never came in to Cyornasberg except on important occasions . Father leaned on a staff carved with dragons and other fierce creatures , and Mother stood close beside him . Beatha , who had served as nursemaid to Hegrin , then Bjaudin , and so on through the rest of the royal children , hovered in the background . Though the need for a nursemaid had passed , Beatha stayed on . Transparently , she hoped for Bjaudin or Elin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the meantime , she ministered to Father and Mother when they would allow it . <p> Mikkel 's conscience bit him a little ; he had just been attempting to read about the wounds his parents had suffered . Their Maimed Majesties , they were called now . Both wore gloves to hide their withered right hands . In addition , Father had suffered a weakened right arm as well as permanent injury to his left knee . It must be painful today for , handsome though his staff was , he disliked using it and did so only at need . Mother also bore the marks of that encounter with the Ice Dragon . Her left hand , where she had gripped the blade of a sword that had been forged from the scales of the Ice Dragon 's mate , was badly scarred . Both were old beyond their years , their faces lined with wrinkles . Once Father 's hair had been like Elin 's , honey gold . Now it was almost pure white . Mother 's hair also had lightened from its silver-gilt color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the two of them , Mikkel wondered where his bright red hair and ice-blue eyes had come from . <p> " Greetings , Mother . Greetings , Father , " Mikkel said , with a bow . <p> " And to you , dear son , greetings , " his father replied . <p> " Did you come to watch the ships come in , or are you merely playing truant from your lessons ? " Mother asked . <p> " Not playing truant ! " Mikkel protested . No need to tell either of them that Bjaudin and Elin were fighting again . " You know I 've always loved to watch ships , and , even better , to go on board one ! " <p> " Well , then , " Father said . " This is a brave sight . Find a good place from which to watch . " Arngrim of Rimfaxe , one of the barons , beckoned to Mikkel and he moved over to stand by him . He liked Arngrim , who bred excellent horses at his holding in Rimfaxe . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a well-earned reputation for tardiness , and so was not disappointed . <p> Three ships had already cleared the headland . One he recognized immediately as Spume Maiden , as it was a frequent visitor to Cyornas Fjord . The second could be none other than Earl Royance 's yacht , Silver Burhawk , with its rakish lines and boldly . ying banner . The third was just cobby old single-masted GorGull , wallowing along , bobbing in the other ships ' wakes , her stern wagging and threatening to throw anybody off the aftercastle . <p> The fourth ship had to be the newest addition to the Nordorn navy , saved for last to impress the crowd . <p> " Can you see the banner on that fourth ship ? " Arngrim asked , smiling . <p> " Not yet , sir . " <p> " You will in a minute , and there 's a rumor that it 's going to be a nice surprise to more than one . That 's the new Nordorn ship , Ice Princess , and your uncle of New Vold , Rohan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to anyone but himself . Further , I have had word that he is bringing Obern-he 's taking his turn captaining Spume Maiden-and young Tj=rvi with him . Look to the banner , Prince Mikkel . There 's a very special person on the Ice Princess . " <p> At that moment , the ship cleared the headland to a gasp of admiration from the waiting crowd . Her design was radically new , crafted along marvelously clean lines . Like Spume Maiden she boasted three masts , with sails square-rigged on the foremast and mainmast and lateen-rigged on the stern , but Ice Princess was built without the overhanging forecastle that always made sailing to windward almost impossible . With a fair wind at her back , she looked capable of outrunning anything that currently rode the waves . Timing her entrance into Cyornas Fjord to follow awkward old GorGull emphasized the improvement . Ice Princess sliced through the chop created by the other ships with scarcely a dip of her bow . <p> The banner-Mithlond 's snow-fox on a deep blue ground- flying alongside Uncle Rohan 's blue-green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence of one of Count Mjdulf 's relatives . It was a mystery Mikkel did not take time to explore . He was too joyful over Arngrim 's other news . Tj=rvi was coming to Cyornasberg ! Now there would be good times indeed ! The royal lad closest to Mikkel in age and station was his cousin Yngvar , and he was a stick . You never could have much fun with Yngvar around . Or , even worse , Msrten of Mithlond , who was nine and thought himself very grown up , much to the annoyance of those who really were . He always wanted to shove in on games of King 's Soldiers-a very popular pastime for all castle residents-yet either could not or would not learn the rules . <p> Count Tordenskjold of Grynet , Admiral-General of the NordornLand and Uncle Rohan 's friend and mentor , had been the one for whom Tj=rvi had been named , but nobody called him by anything but his nickname . <p> Mikkel and Tj=rvi were almost the same age and furthermore , they shared the burden of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already secure . Yngvar was as yet without a rival for his father 's rank and estates and furthermore , made no bones about it . Mikkel rubbed Talkin 's ears . " Do you hear that ? " he said . " Tj=rvi 's almost here ! Good games of King 's Soldiers for a change ! And we can go out hunting ! You 'll like that . " Life in the Castle of Fire and Ice , so burdensome just a few moments ago , seemed sweet once more . <p> " Think you 've got the perfect excuse to get out of your lessons , do you ? " said Granddam Zazar as she puffed her way onto the landing , followed by the unearthly little creature , Weyse , that went with her everywhere . For once Weyse was unaccompanied by Finola , the oldest female warkat in residence at the Castle of Fire and Ice . <p> Talkin uttered a sound halfway between a chirp and a purr , and immediately trotted over to Weyse to begin a wrestling match . The two creatures grappled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zazar ! " Mikkel exclaimed with as much innocence as he could muster . " One must show hospitality when visitors come , that 's all . " Zazar sniffed audibly . " Well , let them come and then let them be gone again . " <p> " How now , Madame Zazar , " Gaurin said , visibly amused . " You will not be pleased to see Rohan ? Or others of your grandchildren ? Possibly even great-grandchildren . Young Obern is married now , you know . " <p> " No blood kindred , " Zazar retorted . " None at all . " <p> " And so the more cherished , " Ashen said , a smile hovering around the corners of her mouth as well . " Perhaps he 's remembered that one piece of magic he could ever master , and will make you a silken rose . " <p> Zazar just sniffed again . " I do n't need any roses , silk or otherwise . " She turned to Mikkel . " If you 're so concerned about manners , why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Answer me that ! " <p> " I 'll go get them , " Mikkel said . <p> " No need , " Zazar told him . " They were arguing over who went through the door first . I informed them on my way here that they 'd better put their disagreement aside , at least for the time being , and get out here to greet their guests or risk my wrath . They 'll be along presently . " <p> Nobody , Mikkel thought , ever got the better of Granddam Zaz . For all that she had become very stooped with age , her mind- and her tongue-was as sharp as it had ever been . . <p> After Granddam Zazar had scolded them and bade them depart in haste to the landing to greet their Sea-Rover guests , Elin- Alditha , NordornPrincess , scowled at her brother , the Nordorn- Prince . " This conversation is far from over , " she told him . <p> " Oh , I know , " he replied . " You wo n't stop until you get Granddam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is what is going to happen . But it is n't . " We shall see , Elin thought . She nodded her head , not quite a bow , and a slight frown on Bjaudin 's forehead smoothed . Go ahead and think you 've won-for now . I 'll have that nice bit of property , never you fear , my dear brother . <p> " Anyway , " Bjaudin continued , " what makes you think Granddam Ysa would agree to such a scheme as making you her heiress unless she thought of it first ? " <p> In spite of herself , Elin stopped , struck by his words . Of course . Elin had overlooked what should have been obvious . As the implications of what Bjaudin had said sank in , she smiled as another plan unfolded in her mind . <p> Granddam Ysa had always been one for schemes and plots . She was old now , but surely she had n't lost all of her cunning . Why not , then , enlist her aid , rather than making her an adversary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Elin 's smile widened as she contemplated the avenues of speculation that opened up before her . Father and Mother were both in ill health . Father now confined himself to Council meetings only , leaving the administrative work to his brother , Uncle Einaar . It was a precarious situation at best , one open to charges of collusion and even treason . " Thank you , dear brother , " Elin said . " You have convinced me of the foolishness of my request . You will hear no more about it from me , I promise . " He nodded in acknowledgment , though his expression told her he did not fully believe her sudden capitulation . <p> A bothersome princess , even the Nordorn Princess , second in line to succeed to the throne , might find herself married off to the first suitor who seemed likely , and sent away to trouble another land . Her sister had been wed when she was not much older than Elin was now . And that would not do at all . <p> Right now , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get through , and the greeting of whatever guests had taken it into their heads to visit the Castle of Fire and Ice , and the necessity of guarding her tongue every moment and trying to convince everyone that , while high-spirited , she nonetheless was sweet and mild and compliant in her nature . To that end , she allowed her brother to precede her through the doorway and down through the ward and thence to the landing where , she had to admit , the arrival of the ships was a brave sight . She paid particular attention to the new ship , Ice Princess , for she was certain it had been named for her . Therefore , it would , when she had gained enough power , be her own private vessel . She would deck it out in silver and white . The sails would be of snowthistle silk - <p> Her reverie was interrupted by the arrival of the first wave of guests . Oh . Nothing to be concerned about . It was only Uncle Rohan and his ill-mannered sons . No sign of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have converse even though she was a rough Sea-Rover maiden , or young Naeve who would be amusing to bully . Elin set her features in the pleasant , noncommittal smile she had practiced often before the mirror in the privacy of her bedchamber . Behind that smile she could think as she pleased , or even doze and dream herself a thousand miles distant . <p> A sudden burst of laughter , shouting and applause brought her back to the present . She realized that Earl Royance had arrived at the landing , escorting a woman who , though elderly by Elin 's standards , was still passably attractive . The waiting crowd was now offering the Earl congratulations and wishes for a long life and-heirs ? <p> It had long been a topic of conversation-oh , call it what it was , gossip-that the old Earl had been smitten with the lady whom he always referred to as " the handsome Mjaurita " and she had accepted his attentions without ever committing herself to any sort of deeper relationship . That explained Mjdulf and Ekla 's presence . Mjaurita @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for years now , and apparently , had acquiesced at last to be married . <p> The ignorant might laugh behind their hands and make jokes about heirs , but Elin had long known that " Uncle " Royance was quite hale for a man of his years , and those years fewer than most thought . Royance was simply one of those men who had looked mature when he was young , and elderly when he was mature . He enjoyed looking the part of the seasoned statesman and also being still able to deliver a surprising counter to those who thought to take advantage of his supposed infirmity of age . If there would not be heirs from this union , the fault , if any , would lie with Lady Mjaurita , whose childbearing years must be well past . <p> Then Elin came fully awake behind her smile . Royance had come to the NordornLand to claim his bride . Such an important wedding demanded the most capable person in the land to organize it , and that would be none other than Granddam Ysa . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would be an unforgivable insult not to do so . Then , Elin would volunteer her services to assist . In the cozy intimacy of making wedding plans , she could remind Granddam that she had long been told she was Granddam 's favorite . What a pity they had been separated so long . What an excellent opportunity to repair that oversight . Perhaps she could even go to live with Granddam for a while , once the wedding was over . <p> Later , Elin told herself , I will go and find that bracelet I once saw in Mother 's jewel chest , a bracelet composed , oddly , of nine tiny teeth strung on a thin chain . She had never seen Mother wear the bracelet and , in fact , it had been hidden under the false bottom of the chest itself . She had found it only by accident-well , by snooping , actually . At first , she had thought it composed of baby teeth shed from her and her brothers and older sister , but the shape was n't quite right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not account for the nine teeth . When she had handled the bracelet , she had felt an odd , almost unsettling vibration as she touched each tooth in its turn . Furthermore , each vibration was subtly different . One tooth , one- person ? They did not look like human teeth , not all of them . <p> Here , she thought , was an article of Power if only one had the means of divining how to use it . Perhaps now was the right time to try to find that means . Granddam Ysa would know . Or , between the two of them , they could find out . <p> That would be her avenue to begin to explore with Granddam ways she could grow more solidly in her favor and become her heiress in fact and in deed . <p> Yes , that would work and much better than her original plan . With Granddam Ysa in the forefront-and taking the brunt of the opprobrium and disapproval that would come her way-Elin could work in the background and , in the end , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> Elin-Alditha Nordorn Queen . Now there was a name to be reckoned with . . As quickly as they could manage , Mikkel and Tj=rvi slipped away from the crowd now surging toward the Castle of Fire and Ice , bearing with them Earl Royance and the Lady Mjaurita , who , as a prospective bride , had arrived on Ice Princess and not Royance 's yacht . They also managed to elude Yngvar , who showed signs of wanting to be included in their company . <p> " Royance and Mjaurita have been all but living together for years , " Tj=rvi said with a shrug . " I do wonder what he bribed her with , to get her agree to becoming his Countess , though . " <p> " Probably his entire estate of Grattenbor with +skar thrown in as well . " <p> " She already had those , or as good as . Well , it 's a woman 's mystery . " Tj=rvi shrugged again , dismissing the entire matter . " Let 's go hunting ! " No sooner said than done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stewards as to the disposition of Tj=vi 's belongings in whatever guest apartment had been assigned to him , paid a hasty visit to the armory . A short while later , having avoided Yngvar once more , and now accompanied by the warkat Talkin and equipped with bows and a sheaf of hunting spears , they slipped out the postern gate of the Castle of Fire and Ice . <p> " They 're starting to call this place Cyornas Castle down south , " Tj=rvi remarked as they made their way out of town and toward a copse of woods where reportedly there was small game to be had . With the approach of winter , conies would have put on their layer of insulating fat . <p> " Cyornas Castle ? Really ? " <p> " Well , you 've got Cyornasberg the town , and Cyornas Fjord already . So why not ? Too much of a mouthful , all this Fire and Ice nonsense . Makes people think you have too high an opinion of yourselves , if you get my meaning , and maybe need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean there are people who would go to war over a-a name ? " Mikkel said incredulously . <p> " Some people would go to war over the way you wear your hair , " Tj=rvi retorted . He glanced at Mikkel meaningfully . <p> Mikkel touched his bright red braids . " It 's the Nordorn style , " he said defensively . " When I 'm older , I 'll cut it . Maybe . " <p> Tj=rvi shrugged . " I suppose the braids keep the stuff out of your eyes . But I 'm saying there are people who would fight you for just such a minor thing . " He smoothed his wavy hair , a little more blond than red , cut a noticeable manly inch above his collar and secured with a headband . Unruly locks nevertheless escaped and hung over his forehead . " I have this , too . " He showed Mikkel an amulet on a thin silver chain . The amulet was in the shape of an open circle and waves forever crashed inside it . " My da gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Mikkel had no such amulet-at least not yet . He decided to change the subject . " Why the fourth ship ? " he asked . " Surely Mjaurita could have sailed on Spume Maiden or even on GorGull if she did n't want to be seen by her new bridegroom . " He sniggered , and Tj=rvi joined him . <p> " Well , as to that , " he said , " Ice Princess is going to have a sea trial . Tordenskjold 's going to insist on it , regardless of the trial she 's already had , both the sailing up the coast and before then . Da will go back in Spume Maiden of course , Royance will be off on his honeymoon in Silver Burhawk , Ice Princess has a quick cruise up and down the coast , and even though it 's late in the season , GorGull is going a-roving . " He paused , relishing his next words . " I 'm going to be on her . " <p> " No ! Truly ? " <p> " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Does your father know about this ? " <p> " Not yet . " Tj=rvi grinned mischievously . " But by the time he finds out , it 'll be far too late for him to tell me no . Obern 's been set to watch , but I can evade him easy enough . " <p> " I suppose , in all the excitement- " Mikkel thought a moment , and then came to an instant conclusion . " I 'm going with you . You think there 'll be room for me on the GorGull ? " <p> " Always room for one more . Well , maybe not Yngvar . " <p> Both boys sniggered . <p> " Definitely not that stuck-up little princeling in training . Just you and me ? " Mikkel said . " Just us . I was hoping you 'd want to go along . That 's the big reason I told you . " <p> " We 'll be cabin boys together , or deckhands , or whatever the captain sets us to do , " Mikkel exclaimed happily . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Younger . He 's grandson to my grandfather Snolli 's old Wave Reader . He says he has a portion of his grandfather 's gift , too , though I 've never seen sign of it . His brother Jens has it more , so he wields the Spirit Drums . " <p> " What do you think he 'll say or do once he finds us aboard ? Will he take us back home ? " " Not likely . It 's the way of the Sea-Rovers . We take ourselves out to sea when we think we 're ready , and nobody objects . If we are , we are , and if we 're not- Well , it 's a weakling gone and not much mourned . " Tj=rvi grinned again . " Fritji 's a fledgling captain . He wo n't dare take us back . That would mean his first outing as a Sea Rover was a failure . So we 're set . In fact , that 's why we 're on GorGull . It 's the oldest ship in the fleet , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The keel 's already laid for her replacement . It 's to be a sister ship to Ice Princess , and called NordornQueen 's Own . " <p> " Never mind that . You 're talking about us maybe being lost as well , " Mikkel said reprovingly . <p> Tj=rvi threw back his head and laughed aloud . " The keel 's been laid for my replacement , too ! " he said . " Mam 's expecting again . Anyway , there 's nothing to worry about . Fritji wo n't go far . One good raid and we 'll be back at home , safe and sound , with stories to tell around the fire all next winter . " <p> Talkin stiffened , and growled low in his throat . He began to move forward at a crouch , eyes intent on something the boys could not yet see . They fell silent immediately , and followed the young warkat . Tj=rvi hefted a throwing-spear , while Mikkel nocked an arrow to his bowstring . <p> What seemed to be an entire nest of young conies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Talkin raced after them in furious pursuit . Mikkel let . y one arrow , then another . His aim was better the second time . Tj=rvi got one with his spear , picked up a rock and brought down another . A high-pitched squeal from farther in the brush told of Talkin 's success . <p> " He wo n't bring it back , will he , " Tj=rvi said . It was not a question . <p> " Not likely . But he wo n't be trying to steal ours , either , " Mikkel told him . " Let 's skin these and take them back . I know a cook who 'll prepare them in a pie , just for us . With a pastry crust and tubers and onions and lots of gravy inside . " <p> Tj=rvi licked his lips . " I can fair taste them already ! " <p> Neither boy paid much attention to the ruination of their good clothes as they knelt in the dust and yanked the skins off the three rather small but plump conies . Stewed with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pastry , they would make a very good meal for two hungry boys . Later they could occupy themselves with a game of King 's Soldiers , and leave both Yngvar and Msrten to entertain themselves . <p> The prospect seemed much more inviting than sitting through what was bound to be a boring state dinner that evening , almost certainly with both of them stuck at the same table with Yngvar . <p> Ashen and Gaurin had retired to the privacy of their own apartment , where they could speak freely as they prepared for the evening 's welcoming guest-feast . <p> " Do you really think they 're just out hunting ? " Ashen asked Gaurin anxiously . <p> " Of course they are , my Ashen , " he replied . " Do n't they always , whenever they are together ? " <p> Ashen had to concede his point . " They should have told us first , " she said . <p> " So they should . But they did not . They are both growing up . " <p> " And I hate to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He did n't try to disguise how stiffly he moved ; that was reserved for public appearances , when he had to hide the pain . He took her in his arms and put her head on his shoulder , burying his face in her pale hair . <p> " You always smell so good , " he murmured . " Clean . " <p> She had to smile at that . " You never knew me when I was growing up in the Bog . I knew nothing of soap . Also , I was less than clean while I was following you to give you the Dragon Blade , " she said . <p> " And you could n't wait to bathe . " He held her closer . " You are as you are . Let your youngest child be as he is . " <p> " Only if he returns to make his manners with our guests . Just imagine what Ysa would think or , worse , say ! " <p> " Speaking of Ysa , " Gaurin said as he released Ashen , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the Duchess her personal invitation to oversee the wedding . She 'll be there and back in less than three days . I am inclined to grant her this request . " <p> " It is surprisingly well thought on , " Ashen commented . " Ysa has scarcely visited Cyornasberg since I suggested she turn her energies to the governance of her duchy . " <p> " As good as exile . It 's been a very peaceful several years . But now I recognize that we must welcome her back to our midst for the sake of others . Perhaps she 's mellowed . " <p> At that , Ashen laughed out loud . " Never ! " she said . " You do bring up the question of what gifts we shall bestow on the newly wedded couple , though . " <p> " I will discuss it with Bjaudin and Einaar . " <p> Then they both took their seats at dressing tables and Ashen rang for Ayfare and Nalren to come and make them ready for the banquet . <p> Though Ayfare had been Chatelaine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for many years , neither would dream of giving up the privilege of being personal attendants and body servants to Ashen NordornQueen and Gaurin NordornKing . <p> They took off their gloves , in preparation for donning fresh ones of white snow-thistle silk . Their Maimed Majesties , Ashen thought , gazing at Gaurin 's withered right hand , a match to her own . She picked up a jar of soothing cream prepared by the Court physician , Birger , in collaboration with Zazar . She opened it not without some difficulty , and began applying it to her hands , especially the dry , withered one . Naught but Nordorn-crowned , the saying had gone , could wield sword of dragon spawn . Well , they both had wielded the sword and , though the NordornLand had been saved , both had paid a fearsome price . She handed Gaurin the jar of cream . He applied it to his hands in turn . The cream kept the skin from cracking and bleeding . <p> " Have you got Rohan 's gift ready ? " Gaurin asked as Nalren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I have , " Ashen said , " and I think you will be pleased with what I have chosen . " Ayfare was ministering similarly to Ashen and as a consequence her words were a little muffled as the Chatelaine massaged a different cream into the skin around her lips . " Ayfare put it in my jewel box for safekeeping . " The two women smiled at each other fondly ; they had been friends since they were barely out of childhood . <p> Though Rohan had never made mention or complained of its absence , Ashen knew that Chieftain of the Sea-Rovers had always worn a particular badge of his office . Rohan 's grandfather Snolli had been the last to do so . " It 's a thumb ring . A special one . " <p> " Ah , " Gaurin said , understanding at once . <p> " All shined and polished , and . t for a Sea-Rover chieftain , " Ayfare said with the easy familiarity of long acquaintance . She set aside the jar of skin cream and began brushing Ashen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her satisfaction , she would braid it in Nordorn fashion . <p> " Snolli set great store by his ring . It is still with him , wherever he may be . " Gaurin held his head steady for Nalren to begin applying a thin layer of cosmetics , a process he particularly hated . Nonetheless , it would not do for the King to appear pale and wan , so he suffered the tinted lotion and a dusting of rouge without protest . <p> Ashen likewise was receiving a slightly heavier layer of rouge to her cheeks and lips than usual . She had to admit that they both looked better and healthier with the applications ; appearances must be maintained . <p> " The white silk is laid out , " Nalren told them . " Perhaps with red surcoats and mantle ? " " That is well thought on . " <p> As women 's styles had changed , so had men 's . Though men customarily went clean-shaven , the NordornKing now wore a neatly trimmed beard , a fashion that several in the court emulated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his collars were high , to conceal the thinness of his neck . When Nalren finished dressing him , only a close eye could detect that he was no longer his hale and robust self . <p> Rather like me , Ashen thought . I am too thin . " Who is overseeing the preparation of the feast ? " she asked . <p> " My assistant , Huldra , " Ayfare said . <p> " You trained her yourself , " Ashen commented . " Therefore , she is to be trusted with tonight 's important event . " <p> " When you have finished with your lady 's hair , would you bring the new Chieftain 's ring for my inspection ? " Gaurin said . <p> " Yes , Sir . " <p> Ayfare put a few last touches on the shining looped braids she had arranged on Ashen 's head , set the small diadem in place , and went to do Gaurin 's bidding . <p> How clever Ayfare is , Ashen thought . The diadem , one of a matching pair made for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if an integral part of them ; the midpoint of the band dipped lightly onto her forehead . A crystal snowflake glittered at the center , and in its heart glowed a fire-stone , one of the handful that remained of the crown of Cyornas NordornKing of reverent memory . <p> Neither Gaurin nor Ashen wore their own state crowns often these days . The spiked silver columns spangled with crystal snowflakes made for a precarious burden , and the bands encrusted with . re-stones rested on their heads far too heavily . The diadems sufficed . <p> Ayfare returned with the newly made ring for the Chieftain of the Sea-Rovers and laid it on Gaurin 's dressing table . As far as Ashen could tell , and working only from her memory , the goldsmith had duplicated the ring as closely as anyone could . Yet another . re-stone , of a size . t for wearing on the hand , adorned the broad band of the thumb ring . Ashen recalled how the original ring 's red stone seemed to flame in whatever light was to be had ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gleaned ages past from another dragon 's hoard . This one had been chosen from among the ones the Mother Ice Dragon had disgorged from her scales when she had been defeated . Rohan would be pleased . <p> Then Nalren and Ayfare helped Gaurin and Ashen into their festive clothing . Current styles for ladies dictated simply cut dresses with a snug bodice ending just below the bosom . The sleeves were separate items , laced in place , and these were lined with soft wool blended with silk . Over this went a crimson fur trimmed sleeveless coat . Her dress and Gaurin 's doublet were covered with embroidered silver snowflakes and on Gaurin 's there was also an embroidered silver snowcat wearing a silver collar-the badge of his house . On her skirt she bore the Ash badge-name rising from a vessel of pure silver . The silver state necklaces set with the remainder of Cyornas 's . re-gems and coats of deep crimson warmed what might otherwise have been too cold an appearance for the two monarchs . Crimson mantles completed their attire . <p> Nalren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it onto his forehead . He and Ashen drew on their gloves , arose from the dressing tables , and Gaurin took up his staff . To Ashen 's secret amusement , both Nalren and Ayfare stepped back a pace , heads cocked appraisingly , so identical in attitude that she nearly smiled . <p> " Do we pass your muster ? " she asked , unable to hold back the words . <p> " You both look very fine . Now , please do not over-do tonight . You need your rest . " <p> " I hear and obey , " Ashen said with a laugh . <p> Contentedly , Ashen took Gaurin 's arm and they left their apartment , there to be met by her ladies and his Court gentlemen . To the sound of welcoming trumpets , they descended into the Great Hall . <p> Excerpted from The Knight of the Red Beard by Andre Norton and Sasha Miller . <p> Copyright 2008 by Andre Norton and Sasha Miller . <p> Published in October 2008 by Tom Doherty Associates ,       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
