<p> So many NFL records should be broken this season . Reciting them all would sound like a broken record . <p> As the NFL 's game evolves , reliance on the running game and dee-fense diminishes . Remember " smash-mouth " football ? Put it in the attic with the rotary phone and the Victrola ( and the broken records , mostly 45s ) . <p> Offenses stretch the field vertically and horizontally , spreading defenders thin and opening the possibility of big plays and more scoring . Three- , four- and five-receiver sets make the old flanker and a split end seem as ancient as cave paintings . <p> Veteran quarterbacks are prospering ( some in new locales ) and youngsters rapidly maturing , while many defenses are ill-equipped philosophically or in talent to match wits and skills with passers picking from a passel of receivers . Three yards and a cloud of dust has become three passes and a touchdown . <p> " The talent is changed . The rules of the game have changed . The game is simply blown wide open , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this revolution . <p> As San Francisco 's coach from 1979-88 , Walsh popularized the so-called West Coast offense , a system emphasizing precision passing . It puts receivers in position to make more yards after the catch . <p> Others brought their style to the party : Marv Levy in Buffalo , letting his quarterback call plays at the line , working with multiple receivers ; Dick Vermeil in St. Louis ( and by extension Mike Martz ) , with an offense that emphasized speed and precise cuts by receivers and the rogue concept of trying to score quickly on every possession . <p> Walsh disciples are everywhere , some of them second generation . Mike Holmgren ( Seattle ) , Mike Sherman ( Green Bay ) , Andy Reid ( Philadelphia ) and Jon Gruden ( Tampa Bay ) are just a few , each with tweaks and add-ons to Walsh 's concepts . <p> Even teams once loathed to fling the ball fearlessly are joining in . Pittsburgh , a downhill running team seemingly forever , features receiver Hines Ward , whose 98 catches are an on-going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field , spread it out more , " says Wade Phillips , the Atlanta Falcons defensive coordinator . " People have gotten away from the idea that you have to run to win . " <p> And everywhere , scoreboards might soon need a third digit . <p> The league 's 32 teams , through 14 weeks ( and 13 games ) , have scored 9,136 points , putting them on pace for 11,244 . That would smash the mark of 10,324 set in 1999 . Touchdowns ? The record of 1,164 , set in 1983 , looks like another victim of the air war . There have been 1,048 end-zone dances , which , if form holds , would yield 1,290 by season 's end . <p> With 67 300-yard passing games in the bank , the record of 80 set in 1995 also could narrowly be eclipsed ; teams are on pace for 82 . <p> " Teams all have talent , " Washington linebacker LaVar Arrington says . " Even the ones that people think are n't any good . " <p> He should know . The Redskins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by total yards . They 're 23rd in points allowed . <p> Raiding the defensive sets <p> In the ebb and flow of the game 's development , talent often arrives in bunches . Quarterbacks poured into the NFL in the 1983 draft , with six selected in the first round . John Elway , Dan Marino and Jim Kelly left indelible marks , but many in and around football decried the decline at the position as those careers wound down . <p> Now there 's a rebirth , with younger players such as Indianapolis ' Peyton Manning , the New York Jets ' Chad Pennington , New Orleans ' Aaron Brooks and Atlanta 's Michael Vick . Can we ignore San Diego 's Drew Brees and New England 's Tom Brady ? Only at our peril . Tennessee 's Steve McNair just keeps getting overlooked . . . until he pulls out another win . And just wait until Donovan McNabb ( broken ankle ) returns in Philadelphia . <p> But there 's also a surge among their elders . Drew Bledsoe , traded to Buffalo by New England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Green Bay . Brad Johnson , with 15 touchdown passes and one interception in Tampa Bay 's last five games , holds the Buccaneers offense together . Rich Gannon , 37 next Friday , defies age in Oakland . It 's not just about the arm . <p> Players such as McNabb and Vick , who are running threats , and those who are shifty in the pocket , such as Gannon and Favre , present so many problems for defenses that are stretched to cover four and five receivers at a time . <p> " A lot of what 's happening has to do with the active , highly mobile quarterback who can throw on the move , avoid a pass rusher and then throw and does n't have to have an arm like a javelin thrower , " Walsh says . " Take Rich Gannon . I do n't know what kind of an arm he has , and who cares ? He completes almost every throw he makes . " <p> Gannon already has erased Marino 's record of nine 300-yard passing games , nailing his 10th against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an NFL-record 5,175 yards , which would again knock Marino ( 5,084 ) back . Gannon has passed for 4,205 yards and needs 880 in his final three games ( 293.3-yard average ) to dust Marino . His per-game average : 323.5 yards . <p> Gannon also is chasing the mark for completions , now with 376 . At his current rate of 28.9 a game , he 'll finish with 463 , topping Warren Moon 's 404 . <p> He 's also the first to acknowledge he 's not out there alone in Oakland . With future Hall of Famers Jerry Rice and Tim Brown and the rapidly improving Jerry Porter shagging passes , with a veteran offensive line and an explosive back in Charlie Garner , the Raiders take full advantage of the clock before the snap . They read defensive alignments and attack . They can and do use every weapon . <p> The change of coaches , from Gruden to Bill Callahan , has only made the Raiders more reliant on their passing game . <p> " I think we developed into a system over the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the options are  --  I do n't want to say endless  --  but we have enough quality veteran players that we can do quite a bit at the line of scrimmage . And our offensive package is pretty expansive . I think that it allows us to really not waste plays , and that 's the big thing . " <p> The expertise and experience of such veterans  --  Rice , 40 , is in his 20th season and Brown and Gannon in their 15th  --  exemplifies what Walsh sees as built-in mismatches . When the Raiders spread the field and put extra receivers out in patterns , they 're almost impossible to stop . Their fourth receiver is better than the opponent 's third defensive back . <p> " Every good athlete wants to be a running back or a receiver . Cornerback ? That 's the third priority for a high school player , " says Walsh , now a consultant with the 49ers . " There just are n't enough of them coming out of college . " <p> For every 15 receivers who come into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are " maybe three or four cornerbacks " at the same level . <p> Walsh 's emphasis on solid cornerbacks still permeates the 49ers . Twice in the last three years they spent No. 1 picks on cornerbacks : Mike Rumph last spring , Ahmed Plummer in 2000 . <p> " It 's hard to find two good cornerbacks , " Phillips says . " Now you have to find four . " <p> Creating coverage qualms <p> But there 's another defensive twist that might be allowing offenses to better control the ball and dictate tempo . <p> With defensive backs unable to lay their hands on receivers once they 're 5 yards downfield , coverages have grown softer . Bledsoe points to the popular Cover-2 scheme  --  zone coverage with the safeties each manning half of the deep part of the field  --  as a possible cause of the very nightmares it 's supposed to prevent . <p> " Defenses around the league have adopted more of a ' bend but do n't break ' type of philosophy , where they 're allowing teams to get more yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says . <p> " I think the Patriots last year set that trend . The Buccaneers played that kind of style for a long time . It 's been effective for them . It does n't work for everybody . " <p> The raids on the Bucs coaching staff in recent years mean St. Louis ( under coordinator Lovie Smith ) and the Jets ( with coach Herman Edwards ) do it now , too . When the Raiders beat the Jets 26-20 two weeks ago , the Jets did n't even try to match up man-to-man with the Raiders . Callahan says the Raiders wound up with 19 pass plays of 10 yards or more against two-deep coverages , with five or six defenders playing underneath . <p> " Keeping the chains moving . That 's the nature of our attack , " Callahan says . <p> " Attack " being the operative word nearly everywhere . It 's probably not coincidental that scoring and TV ratings are up this year . <p> " I think it 's better for the fans . I think the game 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more athletic moves made on the field . You see more and more of these fantastic catches and leaping plays . " <p> Maybe . But what is it that crowds chant when tight games wind down to their chilling conclusion ? Dee-fense . Dee-fense . <p> " Hitting . That 's the spark for the fire , " says Tampa Bay linebacker Derrick Brooks , whose club ranks No. 1 in the NFL in total defense . <p> Because the game is cyclical , defenses will come up with an answer and again hear the crowd 's throaty exhortations . " We had the zone blitz for a while , but now offenses can handle it . They change personnel on every play , " Phillips says . " The next great idea ? I wish I had it . I do n't have it yet .
