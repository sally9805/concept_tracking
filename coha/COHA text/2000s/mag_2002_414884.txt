The first step toward understanding color temperature is becoming a keen observer of light . <p> In nature , color temperature is all around ; artists just need to look for it . By identifying color temperature , they can describe their world more effectively . The Venetians recognized this during the Renaissance , an awareness their art demonstrates . And in Antwerp as well , certainly Peter Paul Rubens possessed a thorough knowledge of color temperature , at least in terms of cool light . Yet today , it is easy to find experienced artists who are completely unaware of the concept but still produce quality artwork . So what is the importance of color temperature and why bother trying to recognize and use it ? Because with an understanding of temperature , artists can enrich a painting 's color , increasing its vitality and effectiveness without garish results . DEFINING THE TERMS <p> Color identity exists in several incarnations . Hue refers to the color family : red , green , or purple , for example . Chroma differentiates intensity , as between the brilliance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to a greater extreme , the relative somberness of a brown , such as burnt umber . Value identifies the lightness or darkness of a color in relation to black and white . Color temperature describes how colors relate to one another and to the color-temperature extremes of blue ( which is the coolest ) and red-orange ( which is the warmest ) . <p> Some artists employ what they call a warm or cool color to describe light and its effect in a picture . Warm and cool are terms of comparison , even opposition . A single color has no temperature . So , while blue is thought of as a cool color and red-orange warm , they must be considered in context with other colors . To refer to warm or cool is automatically to compare at least two colors . You can not have one without another . SEEING THE LIGHT <p> Warm light can be observed easily by looking at the sun shining on a wall or sidewalk . One of the best times to recognize warm light is late afternoon on a sunny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of grayed blue-violet and the lights are steeped with soft , creamy yellow-orange . Just before sunset , light takes on a saturation of intense orange . Indoors , firelight , candlelight , and incandescent light cast warm light , whereas cool light emits from fluorescent sources . Cool light occurs outdoors on overcast days , and it is cool light that streams through north-facing windows . <p> Occasionally , art instructors remark that warm light shining on a subject produces cool shadows , and with cool light , warm shadows result . But be forewarned : Nature is more complex . Artists can not capture the true feeling of color in nature just by creating opposite temperatures between light and shadow . They must become keen observers of light in all its magnificence , from the softest visual whispers to the blinding intensity of the sun . INTERACTION BETWEEN LIGHT AND COLOR <p> Color is least distorted where light is strong . ( The sole exception is glare , found with exceedingly bright light , such as midday sunshine . ) As light recedes , surfaces grow darker and color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself moving from a bright sunny yard into the gentler light of a dark room that has a few beams of weak sunlight falling onto the floor through small cracks and holes in the doorway . If there were a yellow ball in the strong sunlight of the yard and an identical ball on the floor of the room under a weak streak of sunlight , the ball in the yard would seem brighter . Strong light creates intense color ; weak light , darker and duller color . Where there is less warm light , there is less warmth . Therefore , where surfaces are darker and duller , they are also cooler . The sunlight on the yellow ball in the yard would appear lighter , brighter , and warmer ; the weak , warm light on the yellow ball in the room would be darker , duller , and cooler . <p> In the diffusion shadow edge ( the fuzzy area where shadow and light come together ) , this process screeches to a halt . Here , the color temperature seems to reverse itself : The diffusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the light is warm , the shadow 's diffusion edge is warm . The yellow balls would have a diffusion shadow edge of muted orange . <p> Temperature shifts again at the lightest part of the shadow . This area is darker , duller , and cooler than the diffusion shadow edge . Do not march through all your shadows with the same cool , simply making it darker in spots . As the shadows progress into greater darkness and dullness ( as they are increasingly distanced from the light source ) , the darker , more neutral colors of the shadow become warmer , with the darkest parts of a cool shadow the warmest ( Figure 1 ) . <p> Not surprisingly , when describing cool light , the dynamics of warm light are reversed . Where darker warm light is a cool temperature , darker cool light is a warm temperature ; where warm light is warm in temperature , cool light is cool in temperature at the diffusion shadow edge ( Figure 2 ) . Only the strongest light is unchanged . EFFECTS ON SPECIFIC COLORS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the strongly lit parent ( the local color ) and its two bordering areas ( which act as warm and cool color temperatures ) . For example , if yellow is the parent color , then yellow-green serves as the cool temperature and yellow-orange as the warm . As these colors grow darker and duller , the yellow-green becomes more olive and the yellow-orange becomes a slightly orangish mustard or , darker still , rust or even nut-brown . Keep in mind that all these colors mix in our eyes and mind to create the illusion of a yellow object seen in either warm or cool light , depending upon the sequence . <p> A few colors present problems in terms of identifying color temperature . How can an artist mix a color that is cooler than blue to use with blue ? What about a warmer warm than red-orange ? First , there is no color that is cooler than blue . To establish a sense of warm and cool for blue , bring in its tertiary colors : blue-green and blue-purple . Blue-green is not cooler than blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red , so the yellow in blue-green , compared with the red in blue-purple , makes the blue-green seem cool next to the warmth of blue-purple ( Figure 3 ) . <p> Likewise , there is no warm that is warmer than red-orange . To fill the gap , substitute a red-orange that has been darkened and dulled with green . Contrast this red-orange warmth against the coolness of a red-purple that has also been darkened and dulled ( Figure 4 ) . Orange dulled and darkened with either green or blue also can be used as a cool temperature to contrast against the warmth of dulled red-orange . <p> There is no way to create a darker , duller companion for yellow-green or green by using yellow , so move on to a darker warm : red . Adding red to yellow-green or green produces an olive or even bronze green that can serve as the warm ( Figure 5 ) . Mix in the direction of blue-green for the cool contrast to this warmth ( Figure 6 ) . <p> Trying to perceive color temperature can prove frustrating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it . " Usually , this is because they look for color temperature relationships by squinting at the spot they are trying to identify . That may be the proper way to confirm the lightness or darkness of a tonal value , but it is exactly the wrong approach to identifying color temperature . Instead , squint to determine how light or dark a color area is and then , while keeping the value structure in mind , look directly at the same area with your eyes wide open . Next , force yourself to look through it , as though focusing three feet farther on . Or , if you prefer , look at the area with your eyes crossed . Either way , your color response will become noticeably more vivid . HIGHLIGHTS <p> Highlights occur on any surface that is smooth enough to reflect the light source . All highlights have two parts : the stronger light that forms its core and the perimeter ( the fuzzy outer edge ) . The highlight core is always the opposite temperature from the highlight perimeter , and the core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light source . Therefore , in the warmth of strong sunlight , the core of the highlight is cool and the perimeter is warm ; in the weaker light of candles or firelight , the core of the highlight is warm and the perimeter is cool . Most cool light in nature is relatively weak , resulting in a cool highlight core and a warm highlight perimeter . Artificial lights can be a different story : Blue stage lights provide a warm core and a cool perimeter . <p> Since we normally encounter strong warm light ( such as sunlight and incandescent light ) or weak cool light ( such as skylight ) , it is easy to understand why inexperienced artists use white to describe any and all highlights . At first glance they think they see white because the core of such highlights are very light and cool , but closer inspection reveals a light , cool tint of color . <p> When sunshine is at its greatest strength during midday , glare invades warm lighting . Glare occurs as strong light attempts to create a reflection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is visible , and its chroma is less than the strong light surrounding it . Because of this , noonday sun looks washed out where it is lightest . Stronger color takes over as we ease into the lighter middle tones . <p> Reflected images ( as on water , glass , or metal ) and reflected light ( which can bounce off another surface into a shadow ) have one thing in common : The color of what is reflected  --  which is to say the color of the surface from which reflected light has bounced  --  shifts dramatically into greater warmth . Blue sky , when reflected on water , becomes blue-purple . When a yellow wall reflects light into a shadow , its reflection is yellow-orange or even orange . And the weaker parts of the reflected light are darker , duller , and noticeably warmer still before fusing into the rest of the shadow . <p> If your goal is to create convincing realism in your work , color temperature enables you to do so with greater effectiveness . Guard against feeling overwhelmed by the many technical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter your visual vocabulary . Think of understanding color temperature as a gateway to growing satisfaction as an artist . Your art deserves good color , so look around and let nature guide you . <p> DIAGRAM : This diagram , created by Russell Heiden and Martin McDonald , provides the placement of different light intensities , which determines color temperature . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Figure 1 represents the entire range of warm light , from strong light on the left to the darkest , most protected area of the shadow on the right . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Figure 2 is the same progression for cool light . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Figure 3 <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Figure 4 <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Twilight Moon , 1997 , oil on gesso panel , 48 x 36 .
