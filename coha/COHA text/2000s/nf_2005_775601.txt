CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH // 1 . // He was born on August 1 , 1819 , into good circumstances . But his parents lacked the money to stay there , and so they turned , at no small cost to their dignity , to their elders for help . On his mother ? s side , the benefactor was Maria ? s father , Peter Gansevoort , a towering man ( six foot three in an age when six-footers were rare ) famous for having commanded the defense of Fort Stanwix , an outpost guarding the trade route from the Great Lakes , during the British siege of 1777 . There is a tendency today to think of the Revolutionary War as a dispute among bewigged gentlemen who sent men into battle with inaccurate guns to the martial music of fife and drum ; in fact , it was a brutal war whose combatants literally tasted sweat and blood flung from the bodies of their enemies as they slashed at each other with bayonets . It was not uncommon for wounded soldiers to be stabbed through and left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have their brains dashed out with " barbarity to the utmost " by the musket butts of the advancing enemy . Melville was to write about this war in the novel Israel Potter , in which he described the Yankee defenders at Bunker Hill gripping their muskets by the barrel and beating back the British assault by " wielding the stock right and left , as seal-hunters on the beach , knock down with their clubs the Shetland seal . " // Melville ? s Gansevoort grandfather was known for his valor in the face of superior numbers of enemy troops . At Fort Stanwix , having refused to receive a verbal message from the officer in charge of the British assault , he was presented with a written ultimatum to surrender " exhibiting in magnificent terms . . . the strength of the British army . . . and the hopeless situation of the garrison , " to which he replied with formal contempt : // Sir :  --  In answer to your letter of today ? s date , I have only to say , that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to defend this fort , at every hazard , to the last extremity , in behalf of the United American States , who have placed me here to defend it against all their enemies . // I have the honor to be , Sir , Your most obedient and humble servant , Peter Gansevoort , Col. , Commanding Fort Stanwix // This immovable eighteenth-century gentleman lived out his years in Albany . Upon his death in 1812 , seven years before his grandson Herman was born , Peter Gansevoort ? s assets were passed on to his son Peter Junior , along with the obligation to look after his sister Maria and her unborn children . // On the Melville side , too , there was a modest fortune , and Herman ? s father , Allan , did his best to tap it . Allan ? s father , Major Thomas Melvill , was also a celebrated veteran of the Revolution , accustomed to being greeted on the streets of Boston with bows of deference. * In 1831 , when the deference was turning to pity , Dr. Oliver Wendell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Last Leaf " : // My grandmamma has said  --  Poor old lady ; she is dead Long ago  --  That he had a Roman nose , And his cheek was like a rose In the snow // But now his nose is thin , And it rests upon his chin Like a staff , And a crook in his back , And a melancholy crack In his laugh . // One basic fact linked the lives of Melville ? s grandfathers : both had been born English and had become , by violence , American . On childhood visits to Boston , Herman heard war stories directly from Thomas Melvill , who still wore his " old three-cornered hat , / And the breeches , and all that , " and proudly showed his grandson the vial containing tea leaves brushed from his clothes after he had taken part in the Boston Tea Party dressed in Indian garb and warpaint . Though he never knew his maternal grandfather , Herman learned about " the hero of Fort Stanwix " from his mother and uncles , and doubtless had him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " grand old Pierre Glendinning "  --  a massive man who , " during a fire in the old manorial mansion , with one dash of his foot . . . had smitten down an oaken door , " and " in the wilderness before the Revolutionary War . . . had annihilated two Indian savages by making reciprocal bludgeons of their heads . " // If Melville ? s grandfathers were holdovers from the glorious past , his father lived in a fanciful future . Born in Boston , Allan Melvill wooed his bride from a venerable Dutch patroon family in Albany , then moved to the fast-growing city of New York . Having made the Grand Tour of Europe as a young man , he became an import merchant specializing in what today we would call accessories  --  a " deluxe Mr. Micawber , " as James Wood has aptly called him  --  with the groundless optimism of someone proficient at deceiving himself . He was always counting on this or that " confidential Connexion " to deliver a windfall , or assuring his creditors that some long-pending deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he wrote in 1820 to his own father when Herman was not yet a year old , " &amp; without being over sanguine , I may be allowed to indulge , under the blessing of Heaven , anticipations of eventual success . " // Allan was being over-sanguine , and everyone knew it  --  though for a time his bravado almost convinced the world that his failures were temporary and his successes deferred . By all accounts , he had an eye for quality . An advertisement he placed in 1824 in a New York newspaper gives an idea of his inventory : " Fancy Hdfks. and Scarfs . . . Elastic and Silk Garters , Artificial Flowers , Cravat Stiffners , &amp;c . Also in store . . . rich satin striped and figured blk Silk Vestings , Gros de Naples Hdkfs , Belt and Watch Ribbons , 7-16 &amp; 7-22 Silk Hose . . . Horse Skin Gloves . . . Cologne and Lavender Waters , &amp;c . " He could switch easily into the visitor ? s native language when a Frenchman entered his store , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose provenance he loved to detail for friends over a glass  --  or two  --  of old cognac . // But the yield from his talents was meager . Year by year , Allan turned his life into an almost sordid tale of reckless borrowing and groveling appeals for cash to carry him through to the next promised bonanza . He never became at ease in the increasingly impersonal system whereby European exports were sold in bulk to American auction houses , from which they were bought by wholesalers and distributed to the retail trade  --  a business in which good taste and personal charm counted for less than the ability to anticipate rising markets by buying low and falling prices by selling high . Following the trade agreements with Britain that settled the War of 1812 , something like the frantic rhythm of modern commodities markets developed , and Allan Melvill was unprepared . Nearly forty years later , aspects of Allan turn up in his son ? s portrait , in White-Jacket , of an effete Commodore ? s secretary who looks like an " ambassador extraordinary from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pencil-cases " and " fine French boots with soles no thicker than a sheet of scented notepaper. " // If Melville ? s father was always off on some flighty new venture , his mother was a woman of gravity . Daughter of a respected family with roots in the quasi-feudal aristocracy of the Hudson Valley , Maria Gansevoort had grown up speaking Dutch with her parents , who provided her with the years of music and dancing lessons essential to a young lady of breeding who was expected to make herself gracious and decorative . But she was trained as well in the severe Protestantism of her ancestors , and remained wary all her life of placing too much faith in the things of this world lest they be snatched away . Especially in the months after giving birth , which she did eight times , she was given to moodiness , and though she wanted her own children to master such worldly arts as penmanship and deportment , she was at pains to prepare their souls for deprivation and death . // It was from Maria that Herman received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him well into adulthood for his spotty church attendance , and he was never what we would call " observant , " the ultimate questions posed by religion never lost their hold on his imagination . Maria , who knew the Bible in Dutch as well as English , brought biblical stories , exempla , and precedents into the lives of all her children , and for her second son characters from the Bible always remained as vividly alive as the worthies and villains of his own time . Ishmael , Bildad , Ahab , and Elijah are just a few of the names in Moby-Dick by which he invests characters with a priori allegorical significance before they begin to act in his invented world . He ends his great story " Bartleby , the Scrivener " with a quotation from the Book of Job ( Bartleby sleeps " with kings and counselors " ) ; and in his final work , Billy Budd , he gives the music of the Bible in a telling variation to Captain Vere , who quotes Acts 17:28 , reminding his officers that the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not God , but the sea . The pioneer scholar Nathalia Wright counts 250 biblical allusions in Moby-Dick alone . Melville knew the Bible so well , she writes , that " he could smell the burning of Gomorrah , and the pit ; hear the trumpet in the Valley of Jehoshaphat and . . . taste Belshazzar ? s feast . " // In the early years when he heard travelers ? tales from his father and Bible stories from his mother , Herman was too young to understand the toxic mixture of gratitude and resentment that both his parents felt because of their continued dependence on their own parents . But the anxieties of childhood stayed with him . " Ah , fathers and mothers ! , " he wrote in the self-mocking style of Pierre , " . . . give heed ! Thy little one may not now comprehend the meaning of those words and those signs , by which , in its innocent presence , thou thinkest to disguise the sinister thing ye would hint . Not now he knows ; not very much even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in after-life , Fate puts the chemic key of the cipher into his hands ; then how swiftly and how wonderfully , he reads all the obscurest and most obliterate inscriptions he finds in his memory . . . . " When childhood memories do turn up in Melville ? s writing , they tend to be " shadowy reminiscences , " such as his allusion in Moby-Dick to the workmen he saw on visits to Boston , pushing wheelbarrows of dirt down Beacon Hill for the landfill that would become Back Bay . Tensions in his parents ? home in New York and summer visits to his Boston grandfather left impressions that became , over time , fragmentary memories tinged with sadness  --  as when he recalls , in Redburn , the melancholy longing provoked by the miniature glass ship displayed in his grandfather ? s curio case , or when , in Pierre , he draws a portrait of a smothering mother whose compulsive demands on her son are a form of displaced rage . // Among the strains between his parents were their religious differences . Although Allan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted his own father ? s mild Unitarianism , which , according to more pious members of the family , including his wife , tended to diminish the majesty of God in favor of the dignity of man . Maria not only took her churchgoing more seriously but was warmly committed to the Calvinist creed to which her family had subscribed in its Dutch Reformed version . After Herman was born , she managed to persuade her pastor , the Reverend J. M. Mathews , to make an exception to the church rule against home baptism . When Mathews came to the Melvill house on Pearl Street in August 1819 to baptize the new baby , he asked both parents to acknowledge the hard truth that " children are . . . born in sin , and therefore are subject to all miseries , yea to condemnation itself , " and to promise that they would instruct their child " to the utmost of your power " in the shame of its sinfulness . Allan made sure that these affirmations were followed by a reception featuring a strong rum punch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living beyond his means , and so his children grew accustomed to comfort and even to a touch of opulence . The family always employed several servants  --  housekeeper , cook , nurse , and waiter  --  and Allan did not cut back on expenses as he descended into debt . On the contrary , he increased them by moving from address to address , each an improvement in space and prestige on its predecessor  --  from No. 6 Pearl Street , just a few steps from the waterfront , a year later to larger quarters on Courtlandt Street ( on the future site of the World Trade Center ) , to a still grander house on Bleecker Street , and finally , in 1828 , to Broadway , between Bond and Great Jones streets . // Tracing the Melvills ? movements northward in Manhattan reveals a family trying to disguise the fact that its fortunes were declining . Their migration away from the noise and smell of the waterfront exemplified their plight : even as Allan moved up in the world of appearances , he was losing touch with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " as Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote years later , " amid the fluctuating waves of our social life , somebody is always at the drowning-point "  --  and Allan Melvill was one of the drowning . // 2. // How well he hid this truth from his second son is impossible to know . But we do know that on a stormy October night in 1830 , his business in ruins , and owing several months of back rent on his house , Allan Melvill , accompanied by eleven-year-old Herman , fled New York City via steamboat for Albany , where his wife and the rest of the children had preceded him . Two months later , he presented the undignified spectacle of a middle-aged man and father of eight begging his own father for help : " I am destitute of resources and without a shilling , " he wrote to the old Major on December 4 , and " may soon be prosecuted for my last quarters rent . . . without immediate assistance I know not what will become of me . . . . " He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Peter , the Gansevoort son and heir , who generously agreed to cover his " daily expences " with loans . &lt; //
