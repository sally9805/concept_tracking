Critical thinking has long been a goal of social studies education , and its importance has been reiterated in documents delineating standards for the social studies . Yet , teaching critical thinking is problematic because there are competing definitions and practices and many barriers to its implementation ( Wright 1995 ; Onosko 1989 ) . In this article , I briefly outline several approaches to the teaching of critical thinking and develop more fully one recent approach that relies on the use of critical challenges . Methods for Teaching Critical Thinking <p> One way to focus on critical thinking is to teach it as a separate course , either using an existing program such as Philosophy for Children ( Lipman , Sharp , and Oscanyan 1980 ) or designing one to fit a particular context . An existing program has the advantage of being immediately available and has been created by experts who may provide in-service training and support groups , as is the case with Philosophy for Children . By focusing specifically on thinking , teachers can foster a critical attitude , and more sustained learning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might occur . The separate course approach has a number of advantages and , if designed by teachers , is more likely to fit the constraints and opportunities of the existing curriculum and its contexts . <p> The disadvantage of using an existing critical thinking program or creating a separate critical thinking course is that what is learned in the course might not transfer to the rest of the curriculum ( Kennedy , Fisher , and Ennis 1991 ) . Teachers can only avoid that pitfall by a concerted effort to use and build on what is learned in the critical thinking course ( Ruggiero 1988 ) . That , however , takes time and effort , both of which are often in short supply in schools . Another disadvantage of having a separate critical thinking course is that it requires a time slot , and the existing school timetable is often viewed as being overloaded . Furthermore , there is the question of whether one can teach critical thinking through a special course or only through existing subject areas ( McPeck 1990 ) . <p> Another favored approach is infusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject matter in different ways . For example , Paul and his co-authors ( 1989 ) restructured existing lesson plans in many subject areas to incorporate critical thinking . He and his colleagues have also developed ways in which any subject matter can be given a critical thinking focus ( Paul 1993 ) . Another example is the integration of critical thinking into history materials ( O'Reilly 1985 ) . Integration guarantees that students will be exposed to critical thinking competencies and that they may see those as an integral part of learning social studies information . That approach means that there is less risk of teaching " inert " knowledge-knowledge that is never applied outside of the subject matter . Ruggerio ( 1988 ) argues that critical thinking should be taught across all subjects because of the need to practice it in a variety of contexts . He views the teaching of critical thinking as akin to the teaching of writing  --  it must be taught across the curriculum . Olson and Babu ( 1992 ) make the point that the vocabulary of critical thinking ( " argument , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as " therefore " ) has to be taught and needs to be infused in all courses . Such teaching takes commitment and time ; the latter is often in short supply , given the increased responsibilities of teachers and administrators . <p> One disadvantage of the infusion method is that the teaching of critical thinking may lack any sensible sequence or coherence  --  a little fallacy recognition is taught here , a little concept analysis there . The separate course approach requires teachers who are well versed in critical thinking ; it does not necessarily require all teachers in a school be experts . The infusion approach requires all teachers to be well versed in and disposed toward critical thinking . Researchers claim that there are some indications that those abilities are lacking in some teachers ( Onosko 1989 ; Shermis 1992 ) . Furthermore , as with the separate course approach , coordination between social studies teachers and other subject area teachers would have to occur so that the basics of critical thinking are covered in an intelligent way . The Critical Challenges Strategy <p> A recent approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bailin , Case , Coombs , and Daniels ( 1993 ) , who proposed the idea , based their conception of critical thinking on the work of , among others , Richard Paul ( 1993 ) , Bob Ennis ( 1991 ) , Mathew Lipman ( 1993 ) , and Harvey Siegel ( 1988 ) . The concept described here and developed for the Ministry of Education in British Columbia in the early nineties , has its theoretical bases in articles by Bailin , Case , Coombs , and Daniels ( 1999 ) . The concept rejects the skills , the problem solving , and the mental process views of critical thinking . Instead the focus is on helping students acquire the tools needed to resolve problematic situations about what to believe or what to do . The following are examples of such situations : Is there enough compelling evidence that people who play computer games involving violence will engage in violent acts in the real world ? Should I vote for Alice or Avril as class president ? Both are excellent candidates . What is the best way for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recent devastating drought ? Which ancient civilization made the greatest contribution to our society ? Should there have been a recount of the Florida ballots in the 2000 U.S. presidential election ? Write a fair-minded account of the Republican and Democratic arguments concerning the balloting . <p> In all these cases , answers can be disputed , and there is no one right answer . Some answers , however , may be more plausible , appropriate , or justifiable than others . Learning to Think Critically <p> To tackle these kinds of problems , students need specific information and certain tools . No matter the gravity of the problem , students need to have background information about it , criteria for judging the matter , knowledge of critical-thinking vocabulary , thinking strategies , and certain habits of mind . <p> Students either already possess the background information needed , or they are able to get it . They can obtain information from any source , including other students . <p> Criteria exist for deciding that a particular answer is better than another or that no answer is justifiable . Knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking . When teaching students to justify their beliefs and actions , we want to teach them to do more than merely analyze , evaluate , and interpret ; we want them to do that reasonably , effectively , carefully , and seriously . The criteria that we want students to apply to analyzing and interpreting are not esoteric , philosophically sophisticated criteria that only those with degrees in epistemology and ethics are capable of understanding . In thinking critically , we use such criteria as accuracy , clarity , plausibility , relevance , having a weight of evidence for a claim , and logic . <p> In this example , a teacher is thinking through a recent experience : Did Fred take Carl 's hockey cards ? The teacher ponders the following points : Carl claims that he had the cards in his desk at noon and that Fred had shown great interest in them because there were cards that he wanted . Carl , however , would not exchange them with him . Carl believes that Fred then stole the cards when the classroom was empty at noon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I assume that he would do so again ? <p> Would I be showing prejudice if I did ? <p> Michael said he and Fred were outside playing when the cards disappeared , but Michael is Fred 's best friend and therefore might have a conflict of interest . <p> No one else I questioned saw them playing together . But have I asked all the people who might have relevant information ? <p> Sarah , whom I trust as a truthful person , says she saw Fred in the classroom near Carl 's desk at the time the cards disappeared . <p> But she is the only one who says she saw him . Can I infer from what she says that Fred took the cards ? <p> Is there enough evidence from her testimony to believe her in this situation ? <p> Carl might just have misplaced the cards . Can I then justifiably order that Fred be searched ? <p> We have to make decisions all the time , and to make reasonable ones , we apply criteria . We can use criteria well or poorly , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience and practice . <p> We need to acquire the vocabulary of critical thinking . In the vignette , we need to know the difference between a direct observation and the inference that Fred took the cards . Other important concepts in the vignette are " assumption , " " conflict of interest , " and " relevant . " Other words worth understanding are premise and conclusion , cause and effect , deduction and induction , and point of view . When investigating a problem , students need to understand the concepts that are central to it . <p> Thinking through the particular problematic situation requires certain strategies . Although critical thinking does not consist of following a set of lock-step procedures , certain problem-solving , decision-making , inquiry , and cooperative learning procedures are useful . So too are making lists ; discussing ; asking experts ; using graphic organizers , analogies , and models ; and applying principle tests to moral judgments . Those strategies are powerless unless one has certain attitudes and dispositions  --  certain habits of the mind . <p> The skills conception of critical thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific thinking habits . As Case and Wright ( 1999 ) note , <p> By identifying critical thinking as a skill , distinct not only from knowledge but also from attitudes , we overlook the crucial role of attitudes in the formation of critical thinkers . Developing the dispositions of a careful and conscientious thinker is crucial-no amount of " skill " will overcome the limitations of closed-minded , prejudicial thinking . ( 181 ) <p> To gain experience in critical thinking , students apply the tools to problematic situations that are labeled as critical challenges . The problems should meet the following criteria : <p> They require the students to make judgments . They must do more than retrieve information and state an already established answer . The task is not one for which any answer is valid , as it would be if they were naming their favorite president . <p> The answers are meaningful to students  --  sometimes a difficult criterion to meet . Unless the task has some relevance to students ' lives , or challenges their existing beliefs , or teaches curriculum information in an interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken seriously . <p> The critical thinking tasks are embedded in the curriculum . We can teach critical thinking through the existing curriculum ; we do not need to invent a new one . At the pragmatic level , that makes the teaching of critical thinking palatable to school administrators and parents who think that critical thinking is an " add-on " and will detract from learning curriculum content . At a more theoretical level , we learn what is true , acceptable , or plausible within the curriculum content by applying criteria for truth , acceptability , and plausibility . <p> The tasks are feasible . Students need to have the requisite tools or be capable of learning them . The task should not require encyclopaedic knowledge or take vast amounts of time to perform . <p> The problems being considered should not raise the ire of administrators , school boards , or the community ( unless teachers are willing to live with that reaction ) . Many problematic situations involve deep-seated values and raise controversy if they are aired . Although controversy  --  often the stimulus for critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confront , teachers have to be sensitive to community standards . An Example of a Critical Challenge <p> A discussion of capital punishment can be the occasion for critical thinking . In the United States where capital punishment is permitted , and in Canada , where it is not , debates surface when a particular case receives public attention . One U.S. case concerned an elderly woman in Texas who was not granted a stay of execution by then-Governor Bush . In Canada , a case concerned the killing of a police officer and a discussion about whether that crime warranted the death penalty . In another Canadian case , a person who was found guilty of murder eleven years ago , and who would have been sentenced to death if Canada had the death penalty , was recently judged to be innocent of the crime . Recently , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that it would be cruel and unusual punishment to execute mentally disabled people who were convicted of capital crimes . <p> To think critically about capital punishment , students need specific background knowledge . They need an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishment , and arguments pro and con . They must be knowledgeable about who is to be executed , the costs of execution versus those of life imprisonment , and the impact of the type of punishment on the victim 's family . They must consider the possibilities of rehabilitation and wrongful convictions and the concepts of right to life and punishment . <p> The criteria for making a judgment include an evaluation of the accuracy of evidence . The students must weigh the crime against their standards for justice , moral acceptability , and consistency with values appealed to in relevant similar situations . The criteria must be consistent with their broader values ( life , punishment ) and their willingness to live in a society where capital punishment is either legal or illegal . Students must also have an understanding of the terms premise , conclusion , fallacy , and argument . <p> To improve their thinking strategies , students can create a pro and con chart . Using Paul 's ( 1993 ) procedure for fair-minded arguments , a teacher can arrange the students into groups of four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considers a different side of an issue . The pairs then prepare to defend their side of the issue . Pairs can meet with other pairs on the same side of the issue to ensure that they have a strong case . <p> Each pair presents its case to the other pair in its group ; then , each pair challenges the others ' arguments . Each pair then presents the strongest argument for the position of the opposition . Next the assigned positions are abandoned , and the group of four works together to produce a report that summarizes the group 's position . Consensus is not required . Each group member should be prepared to justify his or her individual decision to the rest of the class . <p> It is critical that the discussion members exercise fair mindedness and open mindedness . To ensure that response , the teacher can draw attention to recent media coverage of the problem and make connections in history class between contemporary views of punishment and historical ones . The topic of capital punishment could be part of a unit in law-related education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicly or anonymously , indicate their views on the topic and their reasons . Then they listen to the pro and con arguments , similar to those in appendix A and appendix B. <p> After listening to the arguments , students can create a pro or con chart outlining the arguments , which they can then analyze . They can consider , for example , the evidence for the deterrent effect and determine if the studies are reliable and valid . If the evidence came from countries other than the United States or Canada , can the results be generalized ? Is the fact that police want the death penalty a good reason for retaining it ? Is it good reasoning to argue that because one group of people , or even the majority of people , want something , then everyone should all agree to its implementation ? Is the assumption that murderers can be rehabilitated warranted ? <p> Students should then identify the value premise that underlies each argument . For example , the value premise in the argument that executions cost more than life imprisonment is that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premise in the argument that capital punishment has deterrent value is that we should act on what has deterrent value . In this exercise , the major premise is that citizens should retain whatever will deter potential murderers . The minor premise is that capital punishment deters potential murderers . Those premises lead one to conclude that citizens should retain capital punishment . <p> Most activities in issue resolution and critical thinking end at this point , without students ' questioning their value premises . Those should be evaluated by using the following principle tests ( Coombs , 1980 ) : The new cases test . Given that you would or would not invoke the death penalty in a particular case , would you invoke or not invoke it in a relevant similar case ? The point of this test is consistency in the application of one 's moral principles . New cases should be those that challenge the application of one 's decision . For example , if you favor capital punishment , would that be your decision in the Donald Marshall case in Canada , in which Marshall was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Canada had the death penalty . Many years later another person admitted to committing the murder and was found guilty . Marshall was released . In a similar case in Florida , Frank Lee Smith was found guilty of the murder of an eight-year-old girl . He was sentenced to death but won a stay of execution in 1990 . He died of cancer in prison after spending fourteen years on death row . DNA evidence has just cleared him of the charge ( Vancouver Sun 2000 ) . The universal consequences test . Would the consequences of having or not having the death penalty be better or worse ? Would you want the death penalty , or its abolition , to be universal ? The point of this test is to ascertain if you are willing to have your decision applied in all relevant cases . The subsumption test . Is your decision consistent with your values on killing , on punishment , and on justice ? Does your decision fit with your existing value system ? <p> Another way to focus on the issue is to evaluate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and usefulness . By creating a chart containing the information in appendixes A and B , students can show the pros and cons of each rationale . Fostering Critical Thinking <p> Critical challenges abound in the democratic arena and in the social studies curriculum . Students are interested in questions of justice , of governance , of relationships , of fairness , even in the very question of what constitutes a democracy . Teachers and students can focus on those questions through the use of critical challenges . In British Columbia , with the leadership of the Critical Thinking Cooperative ( an organization made up of teachers and members of professional organizations , school boards , and university and college faculties ) , teams of teachers , some of them funded by the Ministry of Education , are developing critical challenges ( Case , Daniels , and Schwartz 1996 ) . Through inservice activities , mentoring , electronic communication , conferences , and the publication of critical challenges , the group expects that many teachers will soon have the tools for infusing critical thinking into their social studies curricula . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leaders in the field of critical thinking . He states , <p> In a world of pseudo-critical thinking , this approach stands out as remarkable , refreshing and exciting . It is a well-thought through , substantive approach . Anyone using it will be encouraging critical thinking in deep and important ways  --  this core group of committed thinkers is facilitating a long-term substantive approach to critical thinking at every level of education . I do not believe that there is a single state in the United States that can compare with the progress made in British Columbia through the work of the Critical Thinking Cooperative . ( Paul 1997 , 20-21 ) <p> The use of critical challenges provides teachers with a focused way of teaching the tools of critical thinking in the social studies and in other subject areas . Critical thinking is not an add-on to the curriculum ; it is an integral part of learning the content of the social studies . <p> Key words : capital punishment , strategies for teaching critical thinking DEVELOPING RATIONALES FOR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT Retribution <p> Pro : I believe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye for an eye . Punishment involves paying back the offender " in kind . " Thus , we punish murderers by taking their lives . This will signify the seriousness of the crime . It is society 's way of showing the reprehensibleness of murder . The families of victims need to know that society condemns murderers by imposing the ultimate sanction . <p> Con : If the rule is , " An eye for an eye , " we punish murders by taking their lives . To be consistent , we should punish the rapist or the child abuser by raping and abusing them . Can we be sure that the person we execute is really guilty ? Have we not made mistakes in the past ? We do not need to impose the death penalty ; we could punish murderers by using other severe forms of punishment . Utilitarian <p> Pro : We must punish so that people are deterred from committing murder . There is statistical evidence that capital punishment does deter . Further , if given a chance , murderers prefer life imprisonment to death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in jail , showing that capital punishment is a deterrent . Even if mistakes are made , this does not mean that capital punishment is wrong ; it shows that we have to improve our justice system . <p> Con : Deterrence does not rule out capital punishment , but capital punishment has worse consequences than other forms of punishment  --  there is no hope of rehabilitation ; we may execute an innocent person . Just because murderers prefer life imprisonment does not mean that capital punishment deters them more . Life in prison may be awful enough to deter many murderers . Criminals do not seem to be deterred by the possibility of being killed by armed police ; the crime rate is still high . Torturing people to death might be a great deterrent , so that is what we have to conclude if the deterrent argument is plausible . <p>
