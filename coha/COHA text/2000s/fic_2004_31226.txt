Chapter Two Big as asteroids , bone yellow . The grains of sand glowed on the computer screen . The man was sitting forward , neck aching , eyes in a hard squint  --  from concentration , not from any flaw in vision . In the distance , thunder . The early morning sky was yellow and green and a storm was due at any moment . This had been the wettest spring on record . Grains of sand ... " Enlarge , " he commanded , and dutifully the image on the computer doubled in size . Strange , he thought . " Cursor down ... stop . " Leaning forward again , straining , studying the screen . Sand , Lincoln Rhyme reflected , is a criminalist 's delight : bits of rock , sometimes mixed with other material , ranging from .05 to 2 millimeters ( larger than that is gravel , smaller is silt ) . It adheres to a perp 's clothing like sticky paint and conveniently leaps off at crime scenes and hideouts to link murderer and murdered . It also can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Opaque sand means he 's been in the desert . Clear means beaches . Hornblende means Canada . Obsidian , Hawaii . Quartz and opaque igneous rock , New England . Smooth gray magnetite , the western Great Lakes . But where this particular sand had come from , Rhyme did n't have a clue . Most of the sand in the New York area was quartz and feldspar . Rocky on Long Island Sound , dusty on the Atlantic , muddy on the Hudson . But this was white , glistening , ragged , mixed with tiny red spheres . And what are those rings ? White stone rings like microscopic slices of calamari . He 'd never seen anything like this . The puzzle had kept Rhyme up till 4 a.m . He 'd just sent a sample of the sand to a colleague at the FBI 's crime lab in Washington . He'dtwice , and quit once , the criminalist had rehired the unflappable nurse/assistant an equal number of times . Thom knew enough about quadriplegia to be a doctor and had learned enough forensics from Lincoln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be what the insurance company called a " caregiver , " though both Rhyme and Thom disparaged the term . Rhyme called him , variously , his " mother hen " or " nemesis , " both of which delighted the aide no end . He now maneuvered around the visitors . " He did n't like it but I hired Molly Maids and got the place scrubbed down . Practically needed to be fumigated . He would n't talk to me for a whole day afterwards . " " It did n't need to be cleaned . I ca n't find anything . " " But then he does n't have to find anything , does he ? " Thom countered . " That 's what I 'm for . " No mood for banter . " Well ? " Rhyme cast his handsome face toward Sellitto . " What ? " " Got a case . Thought you might wanta help . " " I 'm busy . " " What 's all that ? " Banks asked , motioning toward a new computer sitting beside Rhyme 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheer , " he 's state of the art now . Show them , Lincoln . Show them . " " I do n't want to show them . " More thunder but not a drop of rain . Nature , as often , was teasing today . Thom persisted . " Show them how it works . " " Do n't want to . " " He 's just embarrassed . " " Thom , " Rhyme muttered . But the young aide was as oblivious to threats as he was to recrimination . He tugged his hideous , or stylish , silk tie . " I do n't know why he 's behaving this way . He seemed very proud of the whole setup the other day . " " Did not . " Thom continued . " That box there "  --  he pointed to a beige contraption  --  " that goes to the computer . " &lt; " Whoa , two hundred megahertz ? " Banks asked , nodding at the computer . To escape Rhyme 's scowl he 'd grabbed the question like an owl snagging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Lincoln Rhyme was not interested in computers . At the moment Lincoln Rhyme was interested only in microscopic rings of sculpted calamari and the sand they nestled in . Thom continued . " The microphone goes into the computer . Whatever he says , the computer recognizes . It took the thing a while to learn his voice . He mumbled a lot . " In truth Rhyme was quite pleased with the system  --  the lightning-fast computer , a specially made ECU box  --  environmental control unit  --  and voice-recognition software . Merely by speaking he could command the cursor to do whatever a person using a mouse and keyboard could do . And he could dictate too . Now , with words , he could turn the heat up or down and the lights on or off , play the stereo or TV , write on his word processor , and make phone calls and send faxes . " He can even write music , " Thom said to the visitors . " He tells the computer what notes to mark down on the staff . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Music . " For a C4 quad  --  Rhyme 's injury was at the fourth cervical vertebra  --  nodding was easy . He could also shrug , though not as dismissingly as he 'd have liked . His other circus trick was moving his left ring finger a few millimeters in any direction he chose . That had been his entire physical repertoire for the past several years ; composing a sonata for the violin was probably not in the offing . " He can play games too , " Thom said . " I hate games . I do n't play games . " Sellitto , who reminded Rhyme of a large unmade bed , gazed at the computer and seemed unimpressed . " Lincoln , " he began gravely . " There 's a task-forced case . Us ' n ' the feds . Ran into a problem last night . " " Ran into a brick wall , " Banks ventured to say . " We thought ... well , I thought you 'd want to help us out on this one . " Want to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Rhyme explained . " For Perkins , in fact . " Thomas Perkins , special agent in charge of the Manhattan office of the FBI . " One of Fred Dellray 's runners is missing . " Special Agent Fred Dellray , a longtime veteran with the Bureau , was a handler for most of the Manhattan office 's undercover agents . Dellray himself had been one of the Bureau 's top undercover ops . He 'd earned commendations from the director himself for his work . One of Dellray 's agents , Tony Panelli , had gone missing a few days earlier . " Perkins told us , " Banks said . " Pretty weird . " Rhyme rolled his eyes at the unartful phrase . Though he could n't dispute it . The agent had disappeared from his car across from the Federal Building in downtown Manhattan around 9 P.M. The streets were n't crowded but they were n't deserted either . The engine of the Bureau 's Crown Victoria was running , the door open . There was no blood , no gunshot residue , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no witnesses willing to talk . Pretty weird indeed . Perkins had a fine crime scene unit at his disposal , including the Bureau 's Physical Evidence Response Team . But it had been Rhyme who 'd set up PERT and it was Rhyme whom Dellray had asked to work the scene of the disappearance . The crime scene officer who worked as Rhyme 's partner had spent hours at Panelli 's car and had come away with no unidentified fingerprints , ten bags of meaningless trace ev idence , and  --  the only possible lead  --  a few dozen grains of this very odd sand . The grains that now glowed on his computer screen , as smooth and huge as heavenly bodies . Sellitto continued . " Perkins 's gon na put other people on the Panelli case , Lincoln , if you 'll help us . Anyway , I think you 'll want this one . " That verb again  --  want . What was this all about ? Rhyme and Sellitto had worked together on major homicide investigations some years ago . Hard cases  --  and public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any cop . Rhyme generally distrusted his own ability to read people ( his ex-wife Blaine had said  --  often , and heatedly  --  that Rhyme could spot a shell casing a mile away and miss a human being standing in front of him ) but he could see now that Sellitto was holding back . " Okay , Lon . What is it ? Tell me . " Sellitto nodded toward Banks . " Phillip Hansen , " the young detective said significantly , lifting a puny eyebrow . Rhyme knew the name only from newspaper articles . Hansen  --  a large , hard-living businessman originally from Tampa , Florida  --  owned a wholesale company in Armonk , New York . It was remarkably successful and he 'd become a multimillionaire thanks to it . Hansen had a good deal for a small-time entrepreneur . He never had to look for customers , never advertised , never had receivables problems . In fact , if there was any downside to PH Distributors , Inc. , it was that the federal government and New York State were expending great energy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because the product Hansen 's company sold was not , as he claimed , secondhand military surplus vehicles but weaponry , more often than not stolen from military bases or imported illeg ally . Earlier in the year two army privates had been killed when a truckload of small arms was hijacked near the George Washington Bridge on its way to New Jersey . Hansen was behind it  --  a fact the U.S. attorney and the New York attorney general knew but could n't prove . " Perkins and us 're hammering together a case , " Sellitto said . " Working with the army CID . But it 's been a bitch . " " And nobody ever dimes him , " said Banks . " Ever . " Rhyme supposed that , no , no one would dare snitch on a man like Hansen . The young detective continued . " But finally , last week , we got a break . See , Hansen 's a pilot . His company 's got warehouses at Mamaroneck Airport  --  that one near White Plains ? A judge issued paper to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . But then last week , it 's midnight ? The airport 's closed but there 're some people there , working late . They see a guy fitting Hansen 's description drive out to this private plane , load some big duffel bags into it , and take off . Unauthorized . No flight plan , just takes off . Comes back forty minutes later , lands , gets back into his car , and burns rubber out of there . No duffel bags . The witnesses give the registration number to the FAA . Turns out it 's Hansen 's private plane , not his company 's . " Rhyme said , " So he knew you were getting close and he wanted to ditch something linking him to the killings . " He was beginning to see why they wanted him . Some seeds of interest here . " Air Traffic Control track him ? " " LaGuardia had him for a while . Straight out over Long Island Sound . Then he dropped below radar for ten minutes or so . " " And you drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sound . There 're divers out ? " " Right . Now , we knew that soon as Hansen heard we had the three witnesses he was gon na rabbit . So we managed to put him away till Monday . Federal Detention . " Rhyme laughed . " You got a judge to buy probable cause on that ? " " Yeah , with the risk of flight , " Sellitto said . " And some bullshit FAA violations and reckless endangerment thrown in . No flight plan , flying below FAA minimums . " " What 'd Mis-ter Han-sen say ? " " He knows the drill . Not a word to the arrestings , not a word to the prosecutors . Lawyer denies everything and 's preparing suit for wrongful arrest , yadda , yadda , yadda ... So if we find the fucking bags we go to the grand jury on Monday and , bang , he 's away . " " Provided , " Rhyme pointed out , " there 's anything incriminating in the bags . " " Oh , there 's something incriminating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because Hansen 's scared . He 's hired somebody to kill the witnesses . He 's already got one of ' em . Blew up his plane last night outside of Chicago . " And , Rhyme thought , they want me to find the duffel bags ... Fascinating questions were now floating into his mind . Was it possible to place the plane at a particular location over the water because of a certain type of precipitation or saline deposit or insect found crushed on the leading edge of the wing ? Could one calculate the time of death of an insect ? What about salt concentrations and pollutants in the water ? Flying that low to the water , would the engines or wings pick up algae and deposit it on the fuselage or tail ? " I 'll need some maps of the Sound , " Rhyme began . " Engineering drawings of his plane  --  " " Uhm , Lincoln , that 's not why we 're here , " Sellitto said . " Not to find the bags , " Banks added . " No ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair of f his forehead and frowned the young man down . Sellitto 's eyes again scanned the beige ECU box . The wires that sprouted from it were dull red and yellow and black and lay curled on the floor like sunning snakes . " We want you to help us find the killer . The guy Hansen hired . Stop him before he gets the other two wits . " " And ? " For Rhyme saw that Sellitto still had not mentioned what he was holding in reserve . With a glance out the window the detective said , " Looks like it 's the Dancer , Lincoln . " " The Coffin Dancer ? " Sellitto looked back and nodded . " You 're sure ? " " We heard he 'd done a job in D.C. a few weeks ago . Killed a congressional aide mixed up in arms deals . We got pen registers and found calls from a pay phone outside Hansen 's house to the hotel where the Dancer was staying . It 's got ta be him , Lincoln . " On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smooth as a woman 's shoulders , lost their grip on Rhyme 's interest . " Well , " he said softly , " that 's a problem now , is n't it ? "
