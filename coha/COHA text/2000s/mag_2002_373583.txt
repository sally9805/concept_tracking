Martin Mills , 25 , keeps a low profile in order to stay safe in his tough neighborhood . He cleans hotels for $250 a week and then goes straight home to a three-bedroom house in a predominantly African-American area on the north side of Wilmington , Del . He lives with five of his six children and his girlfriend . His younger brother was robbed at gunpoint and shot in the head a few years ago . " I do n't bother anybody , " he says . " I try to do right , keep a cool head . " He needed one on Sept. 3 , when seven or eight cops descended on him as he was leaving the corner deli . They jumped out of an unmarked van and , according to Mills , knocked over his 1-year-old son in their haste to collar Mills . They frisked him , then shoved a camera in his face . He says he heard an officer say , " We are taking your picture now for anything you might do in the future . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Wilmington police say they have " no record " of Mills ' case . But their chief , Michael Szczerba , makes no apologies for his department 's latest effort to crack down on drugs . This summer units of as many as 18 agents , known to locals as " jump-out squads , " began stopping individuals , usually African Americans like Mills , at drug-infested street corners in search of guns , crack and heroin . The police would then take a digital photo , even with no evidence of malfeasance , to file in a database that Szczerba says can be accessed " if we see a subsequent violation . " The department plans to continue indefinitely what it calls Operation Bold Eagle . <P> The notion of collecting mug shots of potential criminals has sparked comparisons to the futuristic thriller Minority Report , in which a fictional high-tech police unit identifies criminals before they commit crimes , an analogy that Szczerba says is laughable . He adds that it is " highly improbable " that innocent people were caught up in the sweeps . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 600 people detained thus far were not charged with any offense . <P> According to the 1968 Supreme Court decision Terry v. Ohio , police can conduct " stop-and-frisks " if they have a reasonable , particularized suspicion that criminal activity is afoot and a suspect is dangerous . But they can not use these stops to go fishing for criminals in high-crime areas . Cops often fudge that distinction . " Police stop generally young males in high-drug-traffic areas based on very little suspicion all the time , " says Bill Stuntz , a Harvard Law School professor . " The reality on the streets is some distance from what the law says . " In Wilmington , the police insist that they abide by the law by engaging in surveillance before they send out the jump-out squads . But what especially bothers the Wilmington operation 's critics , who range from civil libertarians to local politicians , is the pictures taken by the police . The A.C.L.U. is considering suing the police department if it continues the candid shots . Says one of the group 's directors , Barry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you do n't question people , detain them  --  and you certainly do n't take photos and enter them into a database  --  unless you have reasonable cause .
