Photograph GLORIA FELDT President of Planned Parenthood // WHEN I WAS 13 , MY FATHER HANDED me a slim paperback titled The Facts of Life and Love for Teenagers . My little book became the hottest item at camp that summer . By the end of my two-week stay , it was in shreds . Like most children , my campmates learned about sex from a peer-me ( or at least my book ) . And my career as a sexuality educator was launched . The only problem was that I did n't understand much of what I read and I was too embarrassed to ask questions . No one in my home said " sex . " Ancient history ? I wish . Girls face a triple whammy on the path to womanhood . It starts with lack of knowledge . Then there is the shame about sexuality that comes from our society 's silence about it . Shame and lack of knowledge are bound together by cultural cues about gender roles into a toxic combination that turns many a strong girl into a teenage jelly woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she thinks the world wants her to be . As I was starting high school , my family moved to Stamford , a red-dirt cotton farming community in West Texas . I set out to be sociable and well-liked instead of an achiever . If a girl was intelligent and able , she could be a social misfit . I still got good grades but I managed to hide it . I was elected freshman class favorite and VP of the sophomore class . In my junior year , I was elected cheerleader unanimously . Mission accomplished . I had overcome not only the burden of my intelligence , but that other teenage horror-differentness . We were not only new : we were the only Jewish family in town . I had a serious case of deji vu when this letter came across my desk at Planned Parenthood recently from a woman 25 years my junior : I WAS 15 YEARS OLD when I became pregnant by the " love of my life . I knew it would last forever , I really thought I wanted to be a parent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew the baby would make me happy . Thank God my mother worked for Planned Parenthood in Odessa , Texas . I ended up having an abortion in a doctors office with my mom there to hold my hand afterwards . I have never had any regrets . I am now the mother of four daughters , who I would n't trade for anything in the world . But I 'm so thankful that I did not become a parent at fifteen ! Wake up America ! Talk to your children . Let them know that teens having babies is not acceptable behavior. - WENDY , AGE 33 Wendy and I lived in different times and made different choices about our pregnancies , but we both learned the same life lessons from our experiences . The fall I was 15 , my 19-year-old boyfriend and I announced to my parents that we were married , pregnant , and moving to Odessa , Texas . To save face for everyone , I felt that I had to tell my family I was married rather than admit that I was just another frightened 15-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to fight for my own identity . Instead , I melted into a new mold . So I got what I had always wanted-to be " normal " - the average all-American girl . So average that , unbeknownst to me , the country registered its highest teen pregnancy rate the year-1957-I became a part of that statistic . I remember well the moment five years later , when I decided I was no longer the jelly woman ; I should take care of myself . After our third child was born , a light bulb went off in my head . I realized that if I had to support those three children , I would be up a creek , because I had no employable skills . I called my father and asked for the one hundred dollars I needed to start classes at the local community college . He happily obliged . After that , I was able to get small scholarships to pay for my tuition . The Pill had reached Odessa by then1962-and I started popping those high  --  hormone Enovid E 's like they were candy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having another child would send me over the brink , physically and emotionally . After a while , I could n't take the Pill anymore . The ob-gyn who had delivered two of my children made arrangements for me have a laproscopic tubal sterilization . I went to the hospital alone because my husband had to get the kids off to school and get to work or lose a day 's pay . The woman who signed me in said I had to have his signature . That made my new feminist hackles rise , and I told her that was impossible and , also , unfair-I was the one who got pregnant , after all . When she saw I would n't budge , she called my doctor , assuming he would decline my request . Instead , after a few words with him , she handed me the consent form without a word . That was my small victory . It 's no wonder that history is filled with stories of the desperate measures women have taken to control their fertility . Even today , nearly half of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would consider , or would definitely have , an illegal one  --  risking health and life-if that were their only choice . If history is any predictor , almost all of them would . // Do n't let the Religious Right control government ! // It took me 12 years to get my bachelor 's degree , partly for lack of funds , partly because I wanted to minimize the time away from my children , and partly because I worked part-time . Surprise-I liked having money I had earned myself I liked the sense of accomplishment for work well done . Once I got my degree , my real life work  --  in the reproductive health and rights movement- began . The defining moment was my first day as director of the two-room , donated , Planned Parenthood office in Odessa , Texas , in August 1974. 1 had a one-person staff , no health care or administrative experience , and a bright pink and white button admonishing us to " Love Carefully . " I broke out in a rash from stress but I plunged on . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for low-income women in 17 counties . It turned out that while we were quietly providing services , the issues were being redefined . We neglected to communicate a broad-based public-policy agenda . Abortion became politicized and sensationalized ; sex education and even family planning became controversial . Over the years , as I became more deeply involved in the movement and took a more prominent role , I became accustomed to being told to travel with a security guard and not to work in a bright open office because I 'd be an all-too-easy target for violence . My first experience with clinic invasion came when I headed the Phoenix office . One day a group of a dozen or so people suddenly swarmed in . They terrorized people in the waiting room . Two chained themselves to a desk . That was just the beginning , I know now . What kept me going then-and locks in my dedication now-are the hundreds of letters Planned Parenthood gets ; letters like these , that tell women 's stories : I WAS BORN into an overpopulated house in an ethnic neighborhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a self inflicted abortion . Our family was so damaged as to stunt our intellectual and social growth . Each of the siblings suffered in individual ways . At sixteen , when I learned why my mother died , I determined this would not happen to me. - LINN , AGE 79 ( Linn was able to get contraception when she married at 19 in 1942 . She and her husband planned their four children , and just celebrated their sixtieth anniversary . ) I HAVE BEEN LIVING ON MY OWN since I was seventeen . Without birth control I do n't know what I would have done . I am one of the few girls I know who has n't had an abortion . - SARA , AGE 19 At 32 , 1 reached my midlife crisis . By this time I knew I could not stay in my marriage . It was a desperate feeling that the entire framework I had so carefully constructed to make myself the ideal wife of the 1950s and Supermom of the ' 60s had collapsed . We were both so young when we started out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married if we had met at this point . We divorced when our children were teenagers . Since then I 've been lucky enough to forge a new family with Alex , my life partner . We 've had no children together but we have blended our two families into a new mix enriched by each member and woven into a whole cloth of love . One thing is clear : The ability to make choices has changed the landscape of family formation and the dynamics of sexual power in America . Now women , too , can enjoy their sexuality without fear of pregnancy . Similarly , women who can not conceive are valued for themselves , not cast aside as they once would have been . When men and women are equal partners in all life 's endeavors , we are truly moving toward a world of responsible choices and planned , wanted children .

Is she not as beautiful as the sun ? That is what her name means . She is Sunniva , Sun-Gift . Do you not think she is like the sun ? " <p> " Steady , little one . You will wake your sisters . But yes , you are right . She is most comely . " <p> Ignoring the powerful temptation to look where Alde was pointing , Marc tucked the ends of his big traveling cloak around his excited niece and encouraged the child to lie down again by doing so himself . A swift , anxious glance confirmed that Judith and Isabella were sleeping , sprawled under his cloak , their small faces sunburned with weeks of travel . Isabella was sucking her thumb . The day had been long , the riding hard and tiring . He prayed she would sleep through , free of nightmares . <p> Just one night , Lord Christ . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Uncle Marc ? " Alde whispered , tugging on her lower lip , the pupil of her left eye sliding toward her small , faintly hooked nose as she fought her body 's weariness , " Can I have- " A tiny snore escaped her pouting mouth . <p> Marc waited a moment , watching his charges . His brother had spoken of the " fierce love " a parent feels for a child : in these past months he had come to understand what Roland meant . He would kill for these three . <p> Beside him a female peddler , as gnarled as the sticks she carried for sale on her back , snorted and shifted closer to the central fire . Turning carefully so as not to disturb Isabella , Marc lounged on his side , one hand absently rubbing his aching spine as he scanned the company . <p> Two-and-twenty figures , hunched in various attitudes of slumber , some snoring , most silent , were ranged about the fire , their dun and dust-stained clothes orange in its fading glow . Outside the ruined , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escorts-he could hear the night guards walking and talking softly . So far , the pilgrim party he was part of had journeyed in safety , although he slept with his sword close to hand . Even main roadways such as the one they traveled on were haunted by footpads , ever ready to prey upon the unwary or unprotected . There were rumored to be horse thieves hereabouts in these rough lands of the north and worse still , slavers . <p> He knew of one who would be a great prize to such creatures . Blonde-such fair eyebrows and skin must betoken blonde hair , although he had never seen so much as a strand of it : Sunniva was a modest girl who hid her tresses under a plain russet headsquare . Lithe , with a tumbler 's body : that much he could guess from her graceful walk , though her robe hung on her as if made for a larger woman . And her face ... Marc smiled in the semidarkness . Even at a distance , she was more than comely , she was spectacular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wench ! " <p> The carping voice broke into Marc 's guilty daydream , causing him to stare where he had sworn he would not . Straight across the fire from where he and his three darlings were snuggled into a corner , their backs safe against the fireproof stone walls , a hulking scarecrow of a man sat bolt upright . Cloaks and scraps of precious cloth and even tapestry rolled off him , scattering like chaff as he whirled his beefy arms . " Here , girl , attend me ! Look at me , girl ! You should not be sleeping ! " <p> " Not when my leg troubles me ! " Marc finished for Cena under his breath , clenching both hands into fists as he fought his own temper . Since he and his girls had joined the pilgrim party five days ago he had grown weary of this graybeard 's mewling complaints-the Englishman moaned more readily than six-year-old Isabella . <p> " Is it your knee , Father , or your arm ? " his daughter whispered , rising to her knees , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but even so she made a sinuous , lissome shape that instantly made Marc 's body stiffen , his heart quickening further at the sound of her warm , soft voice . <p> " Shall I rub the joints for you ? I still have some of the comfrey compress I made- " <p> " Bring wine , " was Cena 's graceless interruption , " and do not dally . " <p> He gave her a spiteful shove that had Sunniva rocking on her heels but she did not complain-the wonder was , she never did . <p> " Of course , Father . Is there anything else you desire ? " <p> " Why are you wearing old clothes ? You look like the lowest pot-scourer , not a lady of means ! " <p> " But Father , as you have often told me , I have no means and it is my duty to serve you . " <p> " Aye , and your brothers , remember that ! " <p> " How could I forget , Father ? " <p> " My God , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother ... Why that rag of a headrail , girl ? Do you mean to shame me ? I want you to look good to men ; you 're no use to me ugly . Your blue headsquare is better . " <p> " It must be washed , Father . Is there anything else ? " <p> " More wine ! " Cena 's broken teeth were visible as black patches in his mouth as , grimacing , he raised a scarred hand . " Now ! " <p> " I am going . " Seemingly unafraid of her father 's threat , Sunniva bent close to him . " The dressing on your knee , is it comfortable ? " <p> " No thanks to you . I said you had bound it too tight . And your brother 's teeth are aching again . " <p> " I have looked to Edgar 's hurt , father , and to his horse 's . " <p> " Wine ! Where is my wine ? Must I tell you again , idle slut ? " <p> " Of course . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fist . " Wine will lift your spirits and if you are a little ' hazy ' mounting your horse tomorrow , I am sure the saints will protect you . St. Cuthbert will surely reach down from heaven to save you from falling on your rump . " She raised two elegant , ghostly hands , paler than moonbeams in the guttering firelight , and made the sign of the cross . " I will bring the comfrey , too . " <p> " Get on , chatterer ! " <p> Cena subsided under his mound of makeshift bedding and Marc quickly closed his eyes , in case she noticed him watching . As with many of these father-daughter exchanges he found himself grinning and wondering : she had bested Cena in words yet again , but did that old misery realize she teased him ? <p> I would do much more than teasing , Marc vowed , his mood darkening as he listened to her lightly stepping amidst the sleeping pilgrims toward the baggage heaped in the doorway . Only the girl 's own unfailing good humor stopped him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's three useless sons , who , as usual , slept on through these nightly conflicts . <p> What did Cena mean , " I want you to look good to men " ? Surely such a beauty as Sunniva would be betrothed- <p> A tiny snuffle close to Marc had him raking his head round swiftly , but Isabella was all right , peaceful and tranquil , still fast asleep . Kneading his wry neck , Marc settled onto his side , his eyes drawn inevitably to the other , golden girl . <p> I do not spy , he told himself . I look out for Sunniva because her father and brothers do not . <p> She was at the saddles and packs now , a small shimmer of movement against sooty stones , carefully easing her eldest brother off one of the trunks , gently ruffling his dirty-blond hair to calm his muttering slumber . To his chagrin-he was no longer a gangling youth-Marc found himself blushing , envying the brother her touch . In his own mind , he instantly imagined those slim fingers stroking him-a pleasantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single , piercing glance to Cena . The fellow was snoring again . <p> Sunniva acted fast . Her hands burrowing nimbly inside the trunk , she retrieved a wine flask and salve and then she was off . <p> She was going outside ! <p> Even as Marc marveled at such folly , he was straightening , seizing his sword . Striding over the peddler woman , a scrawny monk and a serving-lad with bare , wind-chapped legs , he reached the other side of the fire before realizing he had misjudged the moment : Sunniva was standing by the threshold , breathing in the sweet night breeze . <p> She was merely snatching an instant for herself , Marc guessed , feeling foolish at his overreaction . Reluctant to intrude further on her , he turned to go back . <p> A slight shift in the air was his only guide that anything was amiss . With a warrior 's quickness , Marc whirled about , freeing his sword , feinting a stumble , lunging his counterattack . His blade slashed through shadows and there were only the grunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the banked-down fire was an utter darkness , where any creature , thief or troll , might linger . He squinted into it , looking for anything stirring , listening intently for the rasp of metal , his head full of old Breton stories of deadly night elves , lethal elf-shot and the evil of the devil . <p> Isabella and the others , were they still asleep ? Safe ? Was he failing them again ? <p> " God help me ! " The whisper burst from his clenched lips and was answered at once by a flash of gold , bright as lightning , and a choked cry . <p> His purse , its long strings newly sawn through , was fixed to one of the few remaining crossbeams , scarcely two spears ' lengths from his own head . Outside there was a rush of fading footsteps , quickly lost in the still night as the thwarted cutpurse ran off the road into cover . <p> Marc was still staring at what had nailed his purse to the beam . Slowly , as in a dream , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purse as it fell . <p> " He will have escaped over what is left of the roof by now , " Sunniva observed softly . " I spotted him scrambling in by the same way , just before you sensed him and reacted , but could not warn you in time to be on your guard . Our night watchers missed him , or never expected a thief to come in that way . I am sorry . " <p> " I heard him leaving . " Amazed that she was talking to him-to him ! - Marc stretched out the arm that was clutching the dagger . As she stepped closer to take it back , he wanted to snatch it away , snatch her away . <p> Rapidly , he schooled his expression into what he hoped was a polite smile and said , " Thank you . That was ... " He hesitated as a thousand questions flooded through his mind . How had she done that ? How had she learned such throwing skill ? How had she seen anything ? " That was unexpected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well in the dark , " she said , taking the knife back most carefully , as if she had guessed part of his thoughts . <p> " Better than most . Far better than me . " <p> She smiled at him for the first time then , another lightning flash in the darkness of their makeshift sleeping quarters , and he felt a bolt of pleasure strike deep in his loins . <p> " You need apologize to me for nothing , " he grunted , retying his purse to his belt for something to do . She could have ridden over him on a war horse and if she smiled that way he would have been smitten afresh . " Nothing . " <p> She looked troubled , but did not answer . <p> Marc knew he should say something : about his nieces , perhaps , or the changeable English weather , or the pilgrimage they were both on for their different reasons . What were hers ? He almost asked her , but then the moon broke through the gray ramp of clouds and lit her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been this close to her and , even as Alde had said , her sheer beauty was unearthly . He had seen no one to compare with her except for the glittering icons of Constantinople , city of wonders . Like an empress in those sacred pictures , Sunniva glowed . <p> Like the icons , she drew him first with her eyes . Large and bright , they were the color of the Breton seas of his childhood , a brilliant blue-green , flecked with gray . Mermaid 's eyes , he thought , glimpsing the pensive dreamer beneath the clear , direct gaze . The skin around them was as flawless as a pearl but briefly , as she blushed and gave him a swift warm smile , he saw her eye corners crinkle and knew how she would look when old : a laughing Madonna , with a long , straight nose , limpid eyes and a bountiful mouth , red and sweet as a pomegranate . <p> Her lashes were long , slightly darker at the tips-as her hair would be , he guessed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile-she had a slight gap between her front teeth . It made her endearing , more approachable . <p> So why was he not approaching ? <p> " Are you bound for the shrine of St. Cuthbert ? " he asked , an obvious question , but anything more seemed beyond him right now . Like strong sunshine , she mazed his wits . " Have you been traveling long ? " <p> " Ten days . And you , sir ? " <p> " Five by road . We were at sea from London before then . " Marc did not elaborate : he was reluctant to draw attention to the fact he was a foreigner . After a year in this country he thought his accent passable . His clothes were English and even his hair , once cropped Norman-fashion , was now almost as long as Cena 's . <p> " Do you go to the shrine for your father ? " he asked . <p> Sunniva nodded , glancing Cena 's way . " We hope the saint may cure his knee , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London like ? " she added , breaking off as her father loudly belched in his sleep . <p> Marc wanted to laugh , but quelled the impulse . Another long , deepening silence wound between them , as the rest of the ruined fort rustled with dreaming sleepers and foraging mice . The fire crackled and spat , the night guards outside stamped their feet , stared at the northern hills and blew on their hands , a man with a filthy bandage on his elbow flopped onto his back and ground his teeth but here , now , he and Sunniva were silent . <p> " Only we two in here are awake , " he said at last . " Or this is a dream ? " He leaned forward and kissed her lightly on the cheek . <p> " My thanks to you , " he said , and tore himself away , returning to his nieces without looking back . <p> Chapter Two Next day , Sunniva was eager to see Marc again , but also wary . From her father and brothers she knew men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they might hunt down a hare , but then losing interest the instant their quarry was captured . Marc might have kissed her on a whim . <p> She had been kissed before , not willingly . Her face burned with bitter memories as she toiled to load her baggage onto her packhorse-her father always wanted to be first away every morning and she had told her maid to help him instead . Her brothers left her to her struggle and for that she was glad . <p> Too much she remembered the friends of her brothers , grabbing her in the yard or the kitchen corridor at home , pressing their sweating bodies and greedy , groping hands against her as Ketil and Told , her twin older brothers , guffawed and bragged about poking a peephole in the wattle wall of her tiny bedchamber , the better to spy on her . It was her eldest brother Edgar , dour yet strong , whose relentlessly sour mood was not improved by persistent toothache , who inevitably dragged such youths off her . Inevitably , too , he would scold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but then Edgar did not care for women . <p> Forget them , Sunniva told herself , resting her forehead against her packhorse 's flank to catch her breath . This pilgrimage was a chance for her , a chance to escape . She had her plans and they involved no men . <p> And yet ... Sunniva 's mouth twisted into a bleak half smile . She longed for children , for a home of her own . She coveted Marc his three little girls . Watched them as often as she could . They seemed happy children during the day , quick and curious as kittens , and Marc was patient with them . She would have liked to make friends with the girls , but that might have alerted her father to Marc . <p> So far , thankfully , Cena had dismissed his fellow pilgrim . Marc was not showy in his green cloak , mud-stained leggings and green tunic , patched at the elbows . He rode an excellent horse , a glossy chestnut , but had no baggage except a small saddlebag . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not rich and so he had felt free to ignore him . Marc , too , was big and broad , a bearded , hairy bear of a man , an obvious warrior , and her father , like most bullies , preferred his victims to be smaller and weaker than himself . <p> Sunniva shivered , fingering her dagger . She had learned to match her actions to her name , to be fiercely cheerful and to smile-smile as her mother Ethelinda had been too fearful to do . Never let them know they hurt you , her mother 's voice whimpered in her head , and Sunniva answered aloud , " I never will . " As ever , the vow gave her renewed heart . She patted the packhorse and lifted her head , wondering what new people and places she would see today . The day was bright and mild-too clear for thieves , she decided , fixing her eyes forward , toward the north , while part of her remembered , with a swift burst of joy , that Marc 's eyes were a rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveling daydreaming of her own child with amber-colored eyes , mentally pointing out cloud shapes and wind-bent trees to her imagined companion , the loose stones of the old Roman road ringing beneath her horse 's hooves like bells . <p> The gladness did not last . The pilgrim party , blowing horns to announce their coming so that suspicious farmers and haughty northern lords would not attack them as possible brigands , came to a crossroads . There they stopped and soon Sunniva heard her father 's voice raised in furious complaint . <p> Cena often argued , especially with those he considered of lower rank . The crossroads was in a narrow gully , where the road sank between high banks to meet a second , sunken road . On this road was a shepherd with his flock , who wished to cross first . Cena was objecting . <p> " We are on the bigger road ! We are the larger party ! Your sheep must wait and so must you ! " <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
