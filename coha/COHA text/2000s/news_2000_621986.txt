<p> For Jason Isringhausen , a spring without incident is a rare and beautiful thing . <p> The A 's off-kilter closer has had enough disasters in his career for a whole bullpen 's worth of pitchers , and many of his worst catastrophes have taken place during training camps past . Some were run-of-the-mill arm troubles and/or the disappointment of being cut from the roster , but others were life threatening : <p>  --  In 1993 , a drunken Isringhausen was climbing up the side of an apartment building when he fell three stories and landed on his head . Informed of this , many of Isringhausen 's current teammates shrug and say , " so that explains it , " but at the time , it was quite serious . Underneath his blond-tipped brown hair , Isringhausen has scars crisscrossing his skull , and doctors told him that if he had n't been so drunk , rendering his body completely relaxed , the fall would have killed him . As it was , he cracked his sternum and broke both his big toes . He missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isringhausen was sidelined for the spring while recovering from shoulder and elbow surgery . That set off all manner of trouble : Frustrated by his set-backs , he punched a trash can after allowing a first-inning homer in his first rehab start . The blow broke his right wrist . <p> " I do n't use my right hand when I hit things now , " said Isringhausen , who kept the many boxing gloves he received after the incident . <p>  --  While recovering from that fracture at the Mets ' complex in Florida , Isringhausen came down with what he thought was the flu . But one night , he could n't breathe , and a team trainer took him to the hospital . After the X-rays came back , Isringhausen was put on the next plane to New York . <p> " They could see a big lump that had eaten its way through my esophagus , " Isringhausen said . " My right lung was filled with a growth , and for two weeks everyone thought I had cancer . That was the scariest time . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many times . And they did a biopsy where they put a tube up my nose and ran it down into my lung . I was awake for the whole thing . " <p> Cancer eventually was ruled out , and while Isringhausen never had tested positive for tuberculosis , doctors began treating him for the disease . He took 13 pills a day for nine months , and he responded beautifully . The growth went away , and the only reminder Isringhausen has is a sharp pain when he sneezes . " Scar tissue in my lung tears and it feels like I 've been shot , " he said . <p> The ordeal had one positive effect . Isringhausen was prohibited from drinking alcohol during the treatment . <p> " Before that , I was a real bad drinker , " he said . " They told me , You have to stop , or it will kill you . ' So for six months , I did n't drink at all , except ( nonalcoholic ) O'Doul 's . " <p> While Isringhausen was recuperating from the tuberculosis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the team 's beat writers . At the conclusion , unaware he was still connected with reporters , Isringhausen signed off with Horwitz and added , " Thanks , Jew boy . " <p> Though the reaction to the slur did n't reach Rocker-esque proportions , Isringhausen was taken to task by the New York press , particularly the tabloids . He was mortified . <p> " Anybody who knows me knows I have a lot of Jewish friends and that I did n't mean it in an insulting way  --  Jay even calls himself that sometimes , and I was joking around , " Isringhausen explained . " I felt bad and I apologized right away . I learned from it . " <p> In 1997 , Isringhausen was in his car attempting to open a package containing an anti-theft device to lock onto his steering wheel . He could n't pry the box open , so he went into his house and got a large knife , which he took back to the car to continue his efforts . <p> The knife slipped , and he stabbed himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and half , adding to Isringhausen 's collection of scars . He applied pressure to the wound with paper towels and drove to the hospital . <p> " I looked down , and the knife was sticking out of my leg , so I went to the emergency room , " Isringhausen said . " ( Mets catcher ) Todd Hundley was in the hospital the same day , so they told him I was there with a knife in my leg , and he said , That does n't surprise me . ' " <p> At that point , so much had happened to Isringhausen that teammates started to keep their distance . " For a few years , nobody came near me , " he said . " It was like there was a black cloud around me . " <p> Isringhausen 's bad luck did seem to spread to two other highly touted Mets pitching prospects , Bill Pulsipher and Paul Wilson , who also are trying to return from arm surgeries . Pulsipher , who talks to Isringhausen regularly , recently had an Izzy-esque experience , losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In the past eight years with Izzy , I 've learned that anything is possible , but he 'll always bounce back , " Pulsipher said . " He 's done a lot of off-the-wall stuff , but as he 's gotten older , I think he 's started to understand life better . He 's been through a lot . " <p> Asked how he 'd describe his past few years , Isringhausen said , " A bunch of four-letter words . I 've had my share of ups and downs . I went from poster boy to doughboy in a matter of two years . <p> " But I would n't change a thing , even after going through all that junk . I think it 's made me a better person . " <p> Isringhausen 's athletic role model was his mother , Georgene , who also is a bit nutty  --  when she was seven months ' pregnant with her only son , she still was playing softball . Jason , the youngest of three , later served as a bat boy for that same softball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and football at Southwestern High School in Brighton , Ill . <p> His future wife , Lorrie Reis , went to the rival high school , and they also attended Lewis and Clark Community College together , but they did n't start dating until several years later , when mutual friends suggested that they were perfect for each other  --  Lorrie being so level-headed and Jason being such a flake . <p> The first time they went out , Isringhausen was quite the charmer . He saw a small diamond ring , a family heirloom , on Lorrie 's finger , and blurted , " I 'll buy you a bigger diamond than that . " <p> He kept that promise , and they were married a year ago . Lorrie Isringhausen now sells corporate jets , and her husband calls her " the smart one in the family . " She also keeps a tight rein on his self-destructive tendencies , refusing to allow him to buy a motorcycle or a fast sports car . <p> More stability came to Isring-hausen 's life midway through last season , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Billy Taylor trade . It turned out to be a steal for Oakland , and a boon for Isringhausen , who escaped the scrutiny of the New York newspapers as well as an undefined role as a reliever and part-time starter . <p> The former starter , 27 , is throwing in the mid-to-upper 90s , which , combined with his kookiness , makes Isringhausen a natural for the closer job . Taylor , the A 's closer at the start of last season , has moved on to Colorado , and the A 's have a player nine years younger in his place . <p> It 's a job that comes with a lot of pressure , and Isringhausen has exactly one month of experience doing it : He was 8-for-8 in save opportunities last September . So he is largely unproven  --  and his success this year could well determine the A 's fortunes . <p> Isringhausen is struggling to find his form this spring , with an ERA of 18.00 . He has allowed six hits and walked three in two innings . But he 's not overly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assured a roster spot . <p> " I 'm not going to say anything to jinx myself , but it 's been a boring spring training  --  and that 's good , " he said . " I do n't need any surprises . "
