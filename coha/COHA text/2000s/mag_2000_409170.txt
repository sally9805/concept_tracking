This international astronomy competition in southern Russia challenges high-school students in the classroom and the observing field . // The Special Astrophysical Observatory ( SAO ) of the Russian Academy of Sciences is 1,350 kilometers south-southeast of Moscow in the northwestern Caucasus , not far from the village of Zelenchukskaya.The SAO operates the RATAN-600 radio telescope and the 6-meter Large Altazimuth Telescope ( BTA ) . Sharing the BTA site are 1- and 0.6-meter Zeiss reflectors also run by the SAO . // NEAR THE VILLAGE OF ZELENchukskaya in the Caucasus Mountains lies the Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences . Its 6-meter ( 236-inch ) telescope was once the largest in the world . For three autumns beginning in 1996 this facility has played host to a multinational gathering of talented highschool students participating in the International Astronomy Olympiad ( IAO ) . Here students get a chance to compete in their knowledge of astronomy and astrophysics , make new friends , and be introduced to foreign languages and cultures . The IAO was founded by the EuroAsian Astronomical Society to help develop astronomical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careers , and improve astronomy and science teaching in secondary schools . The first event , held November 1-8 , included 17 students from Russia , Finland , and Sweden ; Moscow participated as a separate entity . The following year Armenia and India joined , and in 1998 there were representatives from Bulgaria and Brazil . That year I took part as an observer from Denmark , where astronomy recently became part of the curriculum for students 15 to 18 . Photograph Photograph Left .

Unless otherwise noted , all photographs are by Holger Nielsen . Below , right . Students participating in the Olympiad are given examinations in the theoretical , practical , and observational aspects of the science . During this particular test , which lasted 2 1/2 hours , they were asked to determine the masses of the two components of the spectroscopic binary star Capella and to calculate the total mass of a galaxy using its spectrum . The data provided to the students originated in part from research done at SAO . Photograph // Each country can enter as many as five students in two age categories : three 15-16 and two 17-18 . Students are accompanied by two adult team leaders , usually astronomy specialists or educators . The Olympiad is financed mainly by fees paid by the participating countries . Getting There The Special Astrophysical Observatory ( SAO ) is situated in the KarachaevoCherkesia Republic , a member of the Russian Federation . SAO operates two major facilities : the Academy of Sciences Radio Astronomy Telescope ( RATAN-600 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Russia 's largest radio and optical telescopes , respectively . For the six days of the 1998 Olympiad we lived in the village of Nizhnij Arkhyz , where living quarters , workshops , a school , and other facilities have been built for astronomers , staff , and guests . Getting there was n't easy ; Nizhnij Arkhyz is far from common travel routes . The accommodations were spartan but nice - team leaders had a small apartment with a bedroom , bath , toilet , and living room with TV . The rest of the group stayed in two-bedroom apartments . During the first two days we experienced a slight inconvenience due to the ongoing economic crisis in Russia : there was no hot water . Funds available to the observatory for such amenities have been drastically reduced ( S &T.; September 1992 , page 254 ) . Nevertheless the building heat was eventually turned on , a blessing also much appreciated by the residents of Nizhnij Arkhyz ! Galaxies to Sunspots The official languages of the Olympiad are Russian and English . The team leaders are responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete three rounds of examinations - theoretical , practical , and observational . In the theoretical examination the students are allowed to use only pocket calculators . A typical question : " There are about 250 million stars in the elliptical galaxy M32 ( a satellite of the Andromeda Galaxy ) . The total visual magnitude of this galaxy is 9 . If the luminosities of all the stars were equal , what would be the visual magnitude of a single star in M32 ? " ( Answer : 30 . ) The practical exam is more complex . For example , one subject of the 1998 Olympiad was the spectroscopic binary star Capella . The students were given a sheet plotting the orbit of the Ist-magnitude companion relative to the zeromagnitude primary . The orbital data were obtained by ground-based observatories , including the BTA , with speckle interferometry . Using this orbit diagram , radialvelocity curves for both components , the orbital period , and Capella 's parallax , the students had to determine the mass of each star . Another problem involved the spectrum of the edge-on spiral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , photographed with the BTA , in which the spectral lines were shaped like a stretched S. The students were expected to explain the spectrum 's appearance , estimate the mass of the galaxy , and compare it to that of the Milky Way . In both cases students were encouraged to discuss sources of errors and how much they probably affected the calculated results . Such questions represent real problems similar to those tackled by professional researchers . The students also carried out observations . During the day , they observed sunspots with 60-millimeter refractors . They were asked to draw the spots and label their drawings with north , south , west , and east . This was a little tricky due to the diagonal used . Finally , students had to compare their drawings with radio scans of the Sun obtained by the RATAN-600 on previous days and make deductions . In the evening students were handed copies of simple all-sky charts and instructed to find at least five visual double stars . Afterward they were asked to find these stars with the 60-mm scope ( without using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brightnesses , and colors , and explain the observed differences . The Brazilians thought the test was somewhat " hemisphere biased " as their knowledge of the northern sky was limited compared to that of the other participants . However , the organizers compensated for this by giving them more time to complete the task . The exercises are prepared by the IAO organizing committee . The theoretical exams are checked and graded by a jury of representatives from each country , while the practical and observational results are evaluated by the observatory staff . At the closing ceremony all participants receive diplomas . Winners of the first , second , and third prizes are also honored . In 1998 Bulgaria won three first prizes , while India , Russia , and Moscow had one each . Photograph The highlight of the students ' stay at SAO was a visit to the 6-meter ( 236-inch ) BTA reflector ( right ) , by far the largest in Russia and the rest of Europe and Asia .

Photograph Photograph // Giant Telescopes We also had special tours of the RATAN600 and BTA facilities . The RATAN-600 consists of 895 movable reflecting panels , each measuring 2 by 11.4 meters , arranged in a ring more than a half Hometer across . Its total collecting area , including the 400-meter-long linear array inside the ring , is more than 25,000 square meters or roughly one-third that of the 305meter dish at Arecibo , Puerto Rico . Five horn-type feed systems at the focus can make simultaneous observations at up to five wavelengths between I and 50 centimeters . The telescope is currently used to study quasars , active galaxies , interstellar matter , solar-system objects , and , in the future , fine structures in the cosmic microwave background radiation . Twenty kilometers southwest is the 6meter BTA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , the trip to this observatory was the culmination of our stay . The BT.Ks 42-ton mirror was the world 's largest from 1976 to 1991 , when the first of the 10-meter Keck telescopes went into operation in Hawaii ( S &T.; June 1992 , pages 626 and 628 ) . The dome housing the telescope is huge - 53 meters high and 44 meters in diameter . We were told that the dome of one of the Keck telescopes could fit inside it ! Towering north of the building is the giant service crane for lifting heavy parts and equipment . Between the crane and the dome is the sarcophagus containing the telescope 's original , defective mirror . After a tour of the BTAs telescope chamber and control room , our last stop at this astronomical paradise was the SAO 's nearby 1 - meter Zeiss telescope . Students also went on tours to nearby medieval sites , took mountain hikes , and played soccer , including a match between a **27;1720;TOOLONG team and an All-SAO team . On the last evening the team leaders celebrated the Olympiad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , also had their own parties , and at the closing ceremony several groups performed cultural presentations . Departure was a long and tearful affair . Last autumn the fourth Olympiad was held on September 25th to October 2nd at the famous Crimean Astrophysical Observatory and Sternberg Astronomical Institute 's Crimean Laboratory in Nauchnyj , Republic of Crimea . More than 25 students from six countries took part , with an observer and jury member from Sweden . Photograph In addition to having classroom lectures and examinations , the students were treated to nonastronomical excursions such as nature hikes and tours of the region 's well-preserved medieval settlements and churches like this cathedral dating back to the 11th century . // This year 's IAO will be held in late September or early October either at the SAO or the Bulgarian National Astronomical Observatory Rozhen near Smolyan ; the decision should come by mid-March .
