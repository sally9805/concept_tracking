The Tiger Roars // " On my orders , the United States military has begun strikes against al-Qaida terrorist training camps and military installations of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan . These carefully targeted actions are designed to disrupt the use of Afghanistan as a terrorist base of operations and to attack the military capability of the Taliban regime . " // - President George W. Bush , address to the nation , October 7 , 2001 // Darye Suf Valley , northern Afghanistan November 5 , 2001 Late morning // It was dawn when the two dark matte-green Special Operations MH-47 Chinook helicopters landed on the alien moonscape of the Darye Suf Valley floor in northern Afghanistan . One dropped off half of the twelve-man A-Team that would be known as TIGER 02 . The other held the quick-reaction force ( QRF ) that would be needed if the insertion turned out to be hot . // Flaring out above the desert sands , the long , fat chopper reduced the power to its rear rotor blades and brought its nose slightly up . Thick , coarse sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on board checked the magazines on their weapons , made sure a round was chambered , and took off their safeties . The first two ran off the tailgate and took up security positions in the sand as the others threw off their rucksacks and bags of equipment . A fine-tuned killing machine had just been inserted into northern Afghanistan , and the prey would be Osama bin Laden and his terrorists . // Once the twelve Green Berets touched down , Captain Mark Nutsch , the team leader , had his team sergeant , Paul Evans , split the A-Team in half once again . Six of the twelve-man team separated into two three-man close air support teams . Close air support , also known as CAS , or " calling air strikes , " would be one of the key components in fewer than four hundred Green Berets winning the war in Afghanistan in just under six months . In fact , in the first ninety days of the war , there were fewer than 120 Green Berets on the ground , fighting a Taliban and al-Qaida ( AQ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holy warriors. " // Nutsch and Evans had been assigned in early October to General Abdul Rashid Dostum , the Northern Alliance warlord commanding the troops who would bear the brunt of the fighting . The young captain and the tough master sergeant were preparing to advise and assist Dostum in taking back the key northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif before Christmas , when the Afghan winter would turn its worst . The Taliban forces were arrayed against the Northern Alliance in vastly superior numbers , and they held defensive posts all along Dostum 's intended route of attack . // General Dostum was a big man , over six feet tall , and ethnically , he was Uzbek . He had been trained by the Soviet Army to fight against the Afghans , but defected after becoming disenchanted with the Soviets ' methods . Dostum spoke almost no Arabic , but communicated in a smattering of Dari , Russian , and Uzbek . He was viewed by his enemies as a brutal military commander , with an intense hatred of Islamic fundamentalists that was documented back to the 1980s , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his crew-cut graying hair , barrel chest , and imposing presence , Dostum was a gregarious commander who had changed sides many times . // As the press spent their time hypothesizing about America 's tactics , the Green Berets laughed at the notion that the war would take a hiatus during the terrible Afghan winter and , of course , Ramadan , the Muslim month-long period of fasting , contemplation , and prayer . So did their ultimate commander , President George W. Bush . // Two Air Force personnel were assigned to each of the Special Forces ' twelve-man A-Teams , after Green Berets were already on the ground . The Air Force combat controllers were experts at calling in air strikes and performing air traffic control functions . But , according to the Green Berets , the greatest benefit of the additional two Air Force personnel was that they brought two extra satellite radios with them . This allowed Evans and the other team sergeants to break their teams into four three-man elements during close air support missions . They could form a half-moon shape with their teams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improving the already devastating firepower they called in. // Master Sergeant Evans picked one of the Air Force CAS specialists for his three-man CAS team , so he could see firsthand what all the fuss was about . He never had a problem calling in CAS , and there had never been a case of a Green Beret sergeant calling in friendly fire on his own team . The only such cases they had heard about had involved officers , who were not as adept at such tasks . Evans , Staff Sergeant Mike Elmore , and the Air Force sergeant were dressed in the local garb worn by the Northern Alliance . They wore long checkered scarves and round brownish-tan or gray wool pakols , also known as " Massoud " caps , named after Ahmad Shah Massoud , the assassinated legend and former leader of the Northern Alliance . Their attire allowed the Green Berets to blend in with the locals from a distance . The three men also all sported beards they had started growing in mid-September back in the States , when they were first alerted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crouched behind a mound of dirt in an old bomb crater and set up their equipment . The first piece was a large , olive-green , rubberized spotting scope , and the second piece resembled something akin to a giant pair of olive drab binoculars mounted on a small tripod , with a trigger attached to a coiled length of cable . It was called a SOFLAM . SOFLAM ( Special Operation Forces ' Laser Marker ) is special-ops lingo for a laser designator , which shoots out a laser beam to mark the enemy target so that a laser-guided bomb can strike it . // " Scanning for targets , " announced Air Force Staff Sergeant Matt Leinhard over his satellite radio . Evans stared through the lens of the spotting scope , scanning from left to right across the face of the barren , rocky ridgelines that lay ahead . Evans abruptly stopped his scan . " I 've got eyes on a target ! " he exclaimed . // Staff Sergeant Elmore , the team 's weapons sergeant , began punching data into the Panasonic " Toughbook " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their information would be useful with the reports they would be delivering later to TASK FORCE DAGGER headquarters . // " Good to go ! SOFLAM ready , " the towering six-foot-plus Elmore replied . // The Taliban and al-Qaida forces would never quite understand // the concept of smart bombs or the lasers that targeted them , and in // the weeks ahead , a rumor began wildly circulating among them that the Special Forces possessed a " Death Ray " that would destroy anything they aimed it at . The Death Ray was about to unleash a healthy dose of American vengeance . // Sergeant Elmore aimed the laser marker at the front of a Taliban bunker built into the face of the hillside half a kilometer away . Inside the firing ports of the enemy bunker he could see the muzzle flashes of automatic weapons . Bullets cracked overhead as the Berets began taking enemy fire . Sergeant Leinhard picked up the satellite radio and began speaking into it . The snapping of automatic rifle fire raked the shelter just above their heads and made it difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the berm as the enemy bullets showered dirt onto their backs . // " We have two F/A-18s on deck , " Sergeant Leinhard announced , his ear pressed to the LST-5 satellite radio . // " Target is marked , " Sergeant Elmore replied , squeezing the trigger that shot the invisible , infrared laser beam into the front opening of the enemy bunker . // A pair of Navy F/A-18 fighters streaked across the sky twenty thousand feet in the air above the scene , so high they were virtually invisible to the naked eye . One of the planes banked sharply and swooped down , letting loose a thousand-pound laser-guided bomb . As the smart bomb whistled through the air , its internal computer homed in on the laser signature . The bomb 's tail fins directed it on its collision course with the enemy bunker . The three special operators braced themselves , keeping their mouths open so the force of the blast would n't rupture their eardrums. // About half a minute passed , then BOOM ! // The earth shook as the bomb detonated directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown cloud of dirt , fire , and black smoke high into the sky . Master Sergeant Evans waited for the aftershock to pass by them and then peered out through the scope . In place of the bunker was a huge , smoking crater . He could see the body parts of slain Taliban soldiers scattered around it . // " Target destroyed ! " Evans shouted to his partners as he peered through the spotting scope , a wide grin on his stubbly face . // For a long moment there was silence once again , then the entire hillside erupted into a fierce volley of fire . Now , through the spotting scope , Evans could see the muzzle flash of machine-gun fire coming from another bunker on the Taliban-controlled hillside . // " I 've got eyes on another bunker ! " Evans cried out , tapping his partner 's shoulder and pointing toward it . // Something streaking through the air caught their attention . It looked like the Taliban were shooting Roman candles into the sky above their heads . The smoke trails from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Americans ' position . // " RPGs ! " Elmore exclaimed . The Taliban were shooting rocket-propelled grenades toward them , but instead of aiming them directly at the Americans ' position , they were lobbing them skyward like mortar rounds , hoping to land one behind the mound of dirt in the crater that was protecting the American advisors to the Northern Alliance . // The pair of Green Berets manning the spotting scope and the laser marker slid backward on their bellies , seeking as much overhead cover as they could find . The RPGs exploded on the ground in front of their position , showering them with rocks and rubble , and filling the air with black smoke and the smell of cordite . Leinhard was crouched nearby , his hands clamped over his radio headphones . They glanced behind them , down the ridgeline to their rear , to see if any of the rocket-propelled grenades had flown that far . // About a hundred men crouched below them , hidden among the rough boulders . From a distance , they looked the same as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alliance freedom fighters , called mujahadeen , most of them clutching a variety of old AK-47 assault rifles . They looked up at the two Green Berets and their Air Force sergeant with a mixture of fear and nervousness. // " It looks like these guys want to leave , " Elmore said to his partners , chuckling . One of the crouching Northern Alliance militiamen yelled up to them in Dari , the native dialect , barely distinguishable over the roar of enemy fire and the thuds of detonating grenades . // " The muj want to get out before the Taliban can launch a counterattack , " Leinhard shouted over the gunfire . The muj were scared , but not of the Taliban . General Dostum had warned his soldiers that he would personally kill every one of them and their families if an American were so much as superficially wounded . // " Tell them we 're going to hold tight , we 've got the high ground , " Evans responded . // Ignoring the danger , the three soldiers low-crawled up to the top of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peppering the ground in front of them and cracking through the air overhead . // The glint of metal caught the three soldiers ' eyes as they saw something large rolling out from behind a hidden position on the Taliban-held ridgeline . For a second they thought it was a Russian T-55 tank , but in the place of a main gun there were four smaller barrels . It was a ZSU-23-4 , a Russian antiaircraft gun left over from the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan . Through the spotting scope , Evans could see the operator 's head sticking up out of the turret , and as the enemy soldier swung the turret toward them , the four 23mm barrels bristling out of the turret 's center began flashing rapidly , throwing out clouds of smoke . // " I 've got two more F/A-18s on deck ! " Leinhard shouted . // By this time , the ZSU , or " Zeus , " as the Afghans call it , began throwing a volley of rounds in their direction . To them it sounded like the chugging of a steam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air all around them . // Sergeant Elmore aimed the laser marker at the ZSU 's turret . At the same time , the Zeus began rolling backward toward cover . Elmore held the laser beam steady on the front of the berm the antiaircraft vehicle now hid behind . The only thing that gave away its position was the black puffs of diesel smoke that rose from behind the berm. // BOOM ! Another thousand-pound bomb exploded , throwing a mushroom cloud of dust and thick black smoke high into the sky . // " I ca n't tell , but I think we neutralized the ZSU , " Sergeant Leinhard called out on his radio . // The 23mm cannon fire from the Zeus had just been eliminated , but the Taliban rifle and RPG fire were increasing . It was a constant barrage , and down the hill on the friendly side , the Northern Alliance soldiers began to grow even more nervous and weary . // " Tell them if they can hang on another ten minutes , I 've got a B-52 on the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the battle as he held his ear to the radio headset. // " Hoo-ah ! " shouted Sergeant Elmore , unable to contain his excitement , and then he relayed the message to the cowering muj hunkered down behind them . // " It better be quick , " Sergeant Evans replied , " because we 've got enemy troops in the open out here ! " // The Green Berets were carrying the M-4 , a special version of the // M-16 assault rifle , shortened , with a collapsible stock and outfitted with a scope , laser designator , and an improved 5.56mm boat-tailed 70-grain bullet . It was a twenty-first-century version of the old XM177E2 the SOG ( Studies and Observation Group ) recon teams had carried in Vietnam . // A stream of charging Taliban began running down the enemy hillside toward them . The two Green Berets returned fire , picking off Taliban fighters , who tumbled down the slope like rag dolls after being hit by the special operators ' bullets . Ten minutes seemed to stretch into an eternity as the wave of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gap , now running up the front of the friendly hillside , less than two football fields away from the Americans ' position . // The Green Berets looked to their rear , and saw the muj behind them starting to beat a hasty retreat back toward the east , to their original position . //
