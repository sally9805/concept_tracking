<p> FEATURED LETTER <p> On Sunday , fathers throughout the country will open their cards , unwrap their cuff links , ties , shirts , socks and assorted other gifts , enjoy dinner in or out , get phone calls from far and near , and in general be celebrated . Forget the rest of the year : June 20 is Dad 's day . <p> The Illinois Fatherhood Initiative is the nation 's first organization dedicated to promoting responsible fathering and helping children and fathers connect . We 're a volunteer organization . We do this because we want to . For the most part , today we can take it easy ; most of our work happens the other 365 . <p> Our premier activity is our essay contest , in which we invited students throughout Illinois to write about " What My Dad Means To Me . " This year , over 38,000 students responded , and for the first time we asked the dads to respond in writing to those essays . Words can be powerful . Men can be moved . Relationships can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all based on the words of a child . <p> Today , based on the essays , we 'll honor 12 fathers and father figures ( three fathers , three grandfathers , three stepfathers and three father figures ) as Fathers of the Year during an event we 're calling IFI Family Fun Fest at Arlington Park from 5 to 10 p.m . The public is invited to this evening of fun , family activities , refreshments and to recognize the essayists and the men they wrote about . <p> I want to share the poignant words of some of the 144 semi-finalists  --  one from each category . <p> In the stepfather category , fifth-grader Natalie wrote : " I feel that Jim is such a great role model because he sets a good example for the kids . He really can reach out to you in a way that makes you think about how much of a waste of time it is to do something really bad . " <p> " My grandfather is probably the most important person in my life , " wrote Amanda , a University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knows that certain things are too special to take advantage of , and he has definitely shared this with me . I value his gifts of unconditional love , support and humor . " <p> Sixth-grade semifinalist Michael saw his brother as his father figure . " He is 26 years old , has a job , an apartment and is taking classes at DeVry . Joe is always teaching me things such as new words , Bible passages and magic tricks . The biggest reason I see Joe as a father figure is because he is in every part of my life " <p> In the father category , one essayist , Sam , wrote : " I have static cerebral palsy . My dad has helped me a lot . He really helps me with my walking , swimming and playing wheelchair basketball . Without my dad , I would never be able to enjoy all the things in life like I do now . " <p> Sam 's dad had this response to his sixth-grade son 's essay : " My reaction to this essay is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other way around . Sam is my inspiration . I am proud to be Sam 's Dad . " <p> The IFI essay contest uses Father 's Day as the theme to allow kids to express what their fathers mean to them . Maybe more important , Father 's Day can be an opportunity for men to reaffirm what their children mean to them . <p> Jim Paglia , president , <p> Illinois Fatherhood Initiative <p> LETTERS TO THE EDITOR <p> Toll bin jammed ? No fine <p> We want to make sure that Edwina Feret featured letter , May 24 and all other tollway customers know that the toll violation enforcement system is structured so that violation notices are not sent out when toll machines are malfunctioning . The intent of the violation enforcement system is to deter drivers from cheating , not to penalize honest customers . <p> When jams occur in toll baskets , a maintenance alarm is triggered , a signal is sent to the maintenance management system , and a service representative is dispatched to clean and realign the machine . Unfortunately , some customers throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . The violation enforcement system suppresses violation images until the malfunctioning toll basket is repaired . <p> If drivers encounter a machine that appears to be jammed , they should not get a violation as long as they stop and pay the correct amount of money for their toll . If the light does not turn green because the basket is jammed , drivers should proceed after waiting between two and five seconds for the coins to be counted . Paying additional money is not necessary . <p> Payment of tolls is required of those who use the Illinois Tollway , and we are serving all of our customers best by going after those who do n't pay their fair share . We have always made it clear that there are penalties for not paying tolls , and that failure to pay tolls is against the law . <p> We agree with Feret that some additional communication with our customers is needed , and we are in the process of posting a phone number at our toll plazas that customers can call for further information . Our public education efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clarify that violations are not accrued due to broken machines . <p> Finally , if a driver is without exact change at an unmanned booth or accidentally drives through an I-Pass lane without an I-Pass account , he or she can pay the missed toll within five days by calling ( 800 ) 241-0112 . <p> Jack Hartman , <p> executive director , <p> Illinois State <p> Toll Highway Authority <p> Oh , those naysayers <p> Our political system would work great , if it were n't for the other party . <p> Doug Zook , <p> Bensenville <p> Oil , milk price rip-offs <p> The oil industry claims there is a shortage of oil , thus the high gasoline prices . Have you been to or seen a sign at any filling station stating " Sorry , we are out of gasoline ? " Of course not ! Because there is no shortage of oil . <p> Next came the milk shortage . The dairy industry claims that the cattle herds are dwindling , thus the shortage of milk . Have you been to any grocery store that has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Of course not ! Because there is no shortage of milk . <p> These two industries are ripping us off with these phony claims so that their profit margins go up . Now , what are our elected officials doing about these phony claims ? Nothing , of course ! Because the more money these corporations make , the larger the contributions that can be made to their political funds . <p> Now , what can we do about it ? Come election time , get rid of all these do-nothings and hope that the officials we do vote in will be more sympathetic to us . <p> Patrick Spero , Bartlett <p> Hypocrites on stem cell use <p> After reading " Bush sticks to stance against embryo research " news story , June 10 , I can no longer contain my anger at the hypocrisy . The stance taken by our government regarding abortion makes it obvious that they feel an embryo/fetus is not a life and not worth protecting . <p> If that is the case , then I do n't understand how someone can be prosecuted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mother , or how a mother can have her baby taken away for child abuse if it has drugs in its system at birth . If it is not a child , then how is it child abuse ? How can the embryo/fetus be a child sometimes and not others ? <p> As the parent of a preschooler with Type 1 diabetes , my only hope for a cure is through stem cell research . This is not just an " interest in science , " as Laura Bush stated , but a moral issue  --  an issue of improving life for millions stricken by horrible , potentially curable diseases . If the government is going to limit or ban stem cell research on the grounds of " moral issues , " then they need to get off the fence and protect embryos/fetuses in all situations , not just when it fits their political platform . Otherwise , they need to let what they are already allowing to happen to these embryos provide some good to humanity instead of being a senseless waste of life . <p> Laura Kozak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bishops in the United States think denying communion to politicians for supporting issues that run contrary to the teachings of the church is a good idea . Maybe our hawkish politicians will be added to the bishops ' hit list , too ? After all , the pope does n't support President Bush 's war , and " Thou shalt not kill " is fairly important in some theological circles . <p> Denying warmongers communion might show the church intends to be consistent about enforcing its teachings , but I 'm not holding my breath . <p> Meg Miner , Mansfield <p> Too many immigrants <p> So there 's a drive to get our newest citizens to vote metro story , May 30 . Can someone please explain why we still have massive , unfettered immigration ? With unemployment for Americans at a high level , why do we keep bringing in more people ? We are taxed at an all-time high , our hospitals , schools and resources are suffering because of the influx . <p> Mike Mozart , <p> West Rogers Park <p> MY TWO CENTS <p> " Payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tollway , and we are serving all of our customers best by going after those who do n't pay their fair share . We have always made it clear that there are penalties for not paying tolls. "  --  jack hartman
