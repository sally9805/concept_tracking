Should everyone be getting more folic acid ? That 's the question on a lot of doctors ' minds this week . Though not as famous as vitamin C , folic acid plays a crucial role in the development of just about every cell in the body . A member of the B-vitamin family , it 's found naturally in orange juice , beans and green vegetables . There is some evidence that folic acid may reduce the risk of heart disease , but it is best known for its role in preventing spina bifida and other birth defects . Indeed ever since 1998 , when the Food and Drug Administration mandated that it be added to cereal products , the number of so-called neural-tube defects has dropped nearly 20% in the U.S. <P> Now comes word that the vitamin may , just may , help ward off the ravages of Alzheimer 's disease . In a study of more than 1,000 older adults published in the New England Journal of Medicine , researchers at Boston University and Tufts University found that subjects who had high levels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice as likely to develop Alzheimer 's as those who did n't . The finding is important because one of the easiest ways to lower homocysteine levels is to get plenty of folic acid . <P> The study , although not definitive , is the strongest evidence to date that homocysteine plays a role in Alzheimer 's . Previous research had found that Alzheimer 's patients often have high levels of the amino acid in their blood  --  though that could be because folks with Alzheimer 's often do n't eat very well . <P> The new study lays that explanation to rest . As part of the famous Framingham study , which has tracked the development of heart disease among residents of Framingham , Mass. , for more than 50 years , researchers in the 1970s started measuring the homocysteine levels of men and women who had not yet developed dementia . Those patients whose homocysteine levels measured over 14 micromoles a liter while they were still healthy were twice as likely to be diagnosed with Alzheimer 's disease later on . <P> That does n't mean that if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or that low homocysteine levels will protect you from dementia . It 's not even certain , warns Dr. Sudha Seshadri , a neurologist at Boston University who led the study , that " lowering homocysteine levels will lower the risk of Alzheimer 's . " But the case for adding folic acid to your diet is getting better all the time . <P> Of course the best source of any vitamin is a healthy diet . For those of us who still do n't eat our beans and vegetables , most multivitamins contain the recommended daily folic-acid dose of 400 micrograms . ( Eating four slices of enriched bread gives you the equivalent of roughly 100 micrograms . ) There is no risk of overdose , although high levels of folic acid can mask the signs of pernicious anemia in people who have developed the disorder . Folic acid by itself may not keep the doctor away , but there 's no harm trying . <P> For more , click on " What 's New Here " at            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
