// WE MAY COMMISERATE WITH OUR GIRLS AND CRY about it to our mamas . We may even pretend it does n't matter , but in our quiet moments that nagging fear tugs at us : Will we ever really find that special someone ? In a word , yes . There really are brothers out there who are single , available and ready to love you . It actually is possible to find a deeply committed relationship that honors you . But despite what you may have heard , winning at love is n't about identifying the right pool of men or knowing how to play the game . In fact , winning often requires losing-our old attitudes and preconceived notions about ourselves , men and dating . The truth is , most women at some point in their lives will be forced to examine their own beliefs and self-defeating approaches to finding true love . But Jeree Wade , a New York counselor and life coach who helps sisters identify subconscious attitudes that may be getting in their way , says that for Black women this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our history has left us with some extra psychological baggage to unpack . For starters , the world we live in does n't always portray us as loving and desirable . It does n't help when we buy into the often-repeated notion that good Black men are in scarce supply . Studies that suggest we 're less likely than women of other races to marry only make matters worse . " All this leaves us feeling paralyzed , convinced that we 'd better take what we can get , " Wade says . But there is another way , a shift in our consciousness that could help us see a new universe of possibilities when it comes to love . First , Wade says , we have to change our own thinking , letting go of attitudes that make us settle for less than we hope for , dream of , and so richly deserve . The good news is , opening our hearts and altering our behavior are a lot more doable than we might think . see how these four sisters found their way to love . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , A BOOK EDITOR , MET RAHEEM , AN ART INSTRUCTOR , ONE AFTERNOON on a crowded train in Brooklyn . With his beautiful almond-shaped eyes and waist-length locks , he had edged his way over to her and struck up small talk . " At first I told him I was n't interested , " recalls Arlene , 32 . " I 'd just gotten out of a six-year r+elationship with a man who had cheated on me , and I was really jaded about love . " But when Raheem implored her not to give up on brothers , Arlene was touched , and their friendship took off . " He was likable and warm , and I quickly got attached to him , " Arlene says . But she was so intent on a fairy-tale ending that she ignored his frequent disappearing acts . Then she got a call from his ex-girlfriend . " She said they were n't together anymore , but they still shared an apartment , " Arlene recalls . " He tried to explain why he had n't told me , but I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings . " That sense of being lost and powerless was so familiar , " Arlene reflects . She turned to a therapist , who challenged her to ask herself what Raheem had done to be so deserving of her love . Arlene was stunned to discover that she could n't answer the question . " I realized I just wanted to be partnered up like everyone else , " she says now . " So instead of true commitment , I accepted substitutes , like sex and small displays of affection . I was n't really considering what I ultimately wanted for my life . " With her therapist 's encouragement , Arlene turned her focus inward . " I wanted to see if I could become a person I wanted to be with , " she says . She started doing simple things that made her happy-lounging at home reading , spending time with her girlfriends . " I 'd been raised to think of how I could be a better mate , " she says . " Now I thought about how I could be a better me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship another chance . By then he was speaking to a new woman . This time Arlene calmly leveled with Raheem . She told him she would consider nothing less than a monogamous relationship with someone fully committed to her . Raheem later confided that when she was clear about her needs , it had made a difference in how he approached their relationship . " He told me that when we 'd been together the first time , he could n't tell that I was after a serious commitment , " Arlene says . " In hindsight I saw he was right . " After a year of dating steadily , Arlene brought up the subject of marriage , telling Raheem that if he was n't ready for it , she was prepared to move on . " He told me he did n't believe in marriage but was willing to reconsider if it meant so much to me , " Arlene recalls . Soon afterward she discovered that she was pregnant , and Raheem proposed . The two were married last spring and are now the parents of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than our relationship today , " Arlene says with a smile . " Our love is a work in progress , but it 's so much better than any fantasy I ever had . " " I STOPPED ROMANTICIZINGTHE BAD BOY . " ALEX , DENISE 'S FIRST LOVE , HAD BEEN THE OUTLAW AT THEIR PHOENIX HIGH SCHOOL . With the words doggy style cut into his hair , an appetite for roaming the streets , and a rep for doing drugs , he was in stark contrast to her quiet , straight-A self . Still , there was an attraction , and by Denise 's freshman year of college , their romance was in full swing . Denise found Alex 's air of danger " simply irresistible , " and he also had plenty of old-fashioned charm . " He 'd leave roses sitting on my car or have a bubble bath waiting for me when I got home , " Denise , now 31 , recalls . " And he had no problem being affectionate with me in front of his boys . " But seven months into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jealous of any attention she received from other men . He threatened to knock her teeth out , and before long he was grabbing her so hard she would bruise . " Our last fight ended with my crawling out of his home , screaming for help before I managed to get to my car , " Denise says . Frightened by the violence , she moved out of her apartment and refused all contact with Alex . But in her heart she never truly let him go . Eight years later Denise , then 26 , had become a hotshot marketing consultant in Los Angeles-with a nonexistent personal life . " I took the baggage from what had happened with Alex into my relationships , " she says , " so they never worked out . " Then Alex wrote to her , reminiscing about the good times , and she agreed to see him during a business trip to Phoenix . " I had all these unresolved feelings , " Denise admits . " He was so seductive . " She ended up rekindling her romance with Alex , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost as soon as he moved in , Denise realized that little had changed . " He stole money from me and once got so angry he punched a hole in my wall , " she says . " I knew I could n't invite this back into my life , so I told him to leave . " Alex did-but not before breaking a window . Denise berated herself for getting swept up by the madness a second time . Then , slowly , she started to put the pieces together . She saw that Alex had always reminded her of her father , a hustler and drug dealer who had been in jail and absent most of her M , . life . At 17 , Denise had sought out her father and visited him in prison . She spent the next decade writing to him , but the close relationship she dreamed of having with him never materialized . While her father could at times be affectionate , he showed little interest in being a part of her life . " I used to wonder why I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Eventually I began to understand that he gave me what I had wanted but never got from my father , that intense kind of involvement , which I mistook for love . " As Denise made peace with her father 's absence , it helped her to finally put Alex behind her , freeing up a place in her heart . Enter Teddy , a deliveryman working the trade show for her new greeting-card company . A 32-year-old Haitian cutie , Teddy was nothing like the men Derise had been attracted to in the past . But he was nice , so when he asked her for a date she agreed . Ten months later she 's convinced he 's her soul mate . " He calls his parents every day and would never use profanity in the presence of a woman , " Denise says . " What I have with Teddy is real . This is soul food . " " I GAVE UPWATCHING THE CLOCK . " IN HER TWENTIES , IMANI GAVE LIHLE THOUGHT to settling down . But by her thirties the model-turned-accountant heard her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sight , she began to worry . After she watched several of her girlfriends languish for years in relationships that went nowhere , emerging bitter and close to the end of their childbearing years , lmani became determined not to end up like them . So she came up with the six-month rule : If a relationship did n't look as if it would lead to the altar , by the sixth month she would jump ship . The plan seemed practical , but relationship after relationship collapsed under the weight of her rule . " My dates felt pressured and uncomfortable , " lmani now realizes . Two years shy of her fortieth birthday , she hooked up with a computer geek whose quiet , methodical approach was the polar opposite of her adventurous , fun-loving spirit . But he was steady and dependable , and lmani judged him to be a safe bet for a walk down the aisle . She was n't expecting it when , a few years into their relationship , he announced that he did n't want to get married . Devastated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lmani began to think that maybe marriage was n't meant for her-that maybe God had a different plan . But deep down she wondered if her rule was the problem . In time , she decided what she really needed was more faith . " I knew I had to let go and let God , " she says . A few months later lmani , now 41 , met Sean at a retreat thrown by a Black skiers group she belonged to . Also an accountant , he was five years younger and as free-spirited as she was . They felt a strong connection , but lmani lived in Pennsylvania and Sean in Massachusetts , so the two made plans to visit each other . This time lmani decided to abandon her rule . " I became more relaxed and trusting , and at the six-month mark I did n't ask him where this was going , " she says . Her easy attitude allowed their love to blossom , and after just nine months , Sean surprised lmani by popping the question . They were married last June . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WOMEN HAVE SOME IDEA ABOUT WHAT they 're looking for in a man . Bernice , 29 , a graduate student in economics , had a checklist : He should be at least six feet tall , athletic , come from a two-parent home , pull a six-figure income , and belong to the right social organizations . An alumna of a prestigious Black college who had grown up in Jack and Jill , Bernice went to a prominent church , was in a well-established sorority , and wanted a man who could move easily in her world . More specifically , she wanted a man like her father , a lawyer well respected in Midwest Black social circles . But judging all men by her checklist proved problematic . She 'd find men who matched only part of her list or who met all the requirements but were still disappointing-like her last boyfriend , an investment banker whose mother belonged to the same sorority as Bernice . " But he was also a jerk who did n't know how to be faithful , " she says . Then three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was short and stocky and , she says , " just average-looking . " He was also broke , looking for a day job while struggling to launch his own PR business . And his family life was far from Huxtable-esque : His parents were divorced , and he was n't close to his siblings . Yet there was a sweetness about him , and the two became friends . Hanging out soon turned into dating , though at first Bernice kept one foot out the door . " I was concerned about how my family would perceive Solomon , " she admits . " They 're used to my bringing home a different type of man . " But Solomon 's humor and compassion showed her he was unlike any man she had ever dated . She may not be able to wear heels without towering over him , but " he 's so loving , " she says . " Anything good that happens to me he shouts to the world . And his insight on issues makes me want to learn more . At the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks or a six-figure income . I can see spending the rest of my life with this man . " BEA BETTER DATER WE ALL LONG FOR A PARTNER who will love us unconditionally . But when it comes to dating-the job interview of love-too many of us skip the delicious getting-to-know-you process , jumping too quickly from flirtation to full-blown romance . The problem is , this cut-to-the-chase approach tends to short-circuit true intimacy . Of course , dating can be a little intimidating , like a final exam we do n't know the answers to : Do we make the first move ? How long should we wait before calling him back ? How can we tell if he 's interested ? But getting to know a potential love does n't have to be so daunting . These tips will help you get past the first flutter of infatuation to the deep sharing that can lead to abiding love : 1 . ADOPT A POSITIVE ATTITUDE . Sometimes we get so bogged down in wondering if a date is " the one " that we forget simply to appreciate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a means to an end but as a process you Ban enjoy . " What we seek , we 're likely to get , " says New York counselor and life coach Jeree Wade . " So if you go in determined to enjoy yourself , the odds are that you will . " 2 . DO N'T WAIT TO BE ASKED . It 's one thing to trust that your soul mate is out there , but quite another to wait for him to be magically delivered to your doorstep . That old proverb " God helps those who help themselves " is as true for dating as for anything else . Instead of waiting to be chosen , feel free to do the choosing . " There 's nothing wrong with inviting someone to have a cup of coffee or share a meal , " Wade says . And if you ask in an easygoing , openhearted way , neither of yeipwill feel pressured. 3 . MAKE FRIENDSHIP THE GOAL . Happily married couples will tell you that friendship is the glue of lasting love . So it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful romance . But if it becomes clear that your date is headed more toward the platonic than the romantic , think of it as an opportunity to learn more about men straight from the source . Even if he is n't your soul mate , your date still could become a lifelong friend , the one you call when you want to catch that Sfar Trek marathon or want an escort for your cousin 's wedding . 4 . RISK BEING YOURSELF . Putting your best lot forward does n't mean you have to fudge the truth about your likes and dislikes or cover up your past . Uare to be your authentic self , to express what matters to you deeply . Of course , there are levels of intimacy , and you should n't feel as if you have to reveal everything about yourself on the first date . But be open to sharing who you are in a natural way . 5 . INCLUDE HIM IN YOUR SOCIAL CIRCLE . Do n't turn dating into a project . Instead make it a part of your social life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When your consciousness is , I 've got to find my husband , you 're putting the need for a man before everything ape , " Wade says . Besides , it can make you seem desperate and turn men away . So aim for a fully rounded social life in which you routinely interact with men . And do n't hesitate to take ablate to events that include family and friends . The way a man interacts with the people-you love can speak volumes about the kind of person he is . Photograph Sidebar Want to find your soul mate ?
