The " juice " that always seems to leak out of those packages of fresh chicken you bring home from the supermarket can make a big mess on your kitchen counter . But more importantly , the juice can pose a hazard to your health . Nasty microbes called Campylobacter jejuni can live in that liquid and on the skin of fresh , uncooked poultry . <p> Thoroughly cooking chicken  --  by grilling , frying , roasting , or baking  --  kills this food-poisoning microbe . But if you accidentally splash some of the raw juice on food that you 'd planned to eat uncooked , such as leafy greens for a fresh salad , you 'd be wise to throw them out . Here 's why : If the microbe takes hold on those greens , as it is very adept at doing , you might be in for a case of . campylobacteriosis food poisoning that you wo n't soon forget . <p> Campylobacter is thought to be the leading cause of bacterial food poisoning in humans and is likely the perpetrator of more than 400 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you handle raw poultry should help keep you safe , ARS researchers want to do more to zap this microbial menace before it reaches your home . <p> At Albany , California , scientists in the ARS Produce Safety and Microbiology Research Unit are making key advances in the international effort to clobber Campylobacter . The California team , based at the Western Regional Research Center , is focusing on Campylobacter 's genes . <p> Why the interest in the microbe 's genetic makeup ? Because investigating genes may lead to discovery of faster , more reliable ways to detect the microbe in samples from humans and other animals , food , and water . <p> In addition , gene-based research opens the door to simpler , less-expensive tactics for distinguishing look-alike species and strains of Campylobacter and its close relatives , such as the Arcobacters . This will enable experts to quickly finger culprit microbes in food poisoning outbreaks . <p> Finally , the studies may lead to innovative , environmentally friendly techniques to circumvent the genes that make C. jejuni strains so successful in causing human gastrointestinal upset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Working with the Institute for Genomic Research , Rockville , Maryland , the Albany scientists have decoded the makeup , or sequence , of all the genes and other genetic material in a specially selected strain of C. jejuni . <p> This research represents the first time that a C. jejuni strain from a farm animal  --  in this case , a market chicken  --  has been sequenced . That 's important , notes research leader Robert E. Mandrell , because chicken is the leading source of the bacterium in food . Earlier C. jejuni genome sequencing , performed elsewhere , was based on a specimen from a gastroenteritis patient and was lacking key features , such as the ability to colonize chickens , Mandrell says . <p> The next step : Zero in on specific genes . " We 're particularly interested in the genes that make Campylobacter so viable and virulent , " says ARS molecular biologist William G. Miller . They 're targeting , for instance , genes that carry the code for making oligosaccharides . These compounds likely enable the microbe to stick like glue to chicken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are bathed and rinsed with chlorinated water . The oligosaccharides might be important in invading and colonizing the human body , as well , Miller notes . <p> With this genome sequence information in hand , the scientists are developing microarrays , or gene chips , that make possible a quick look at thousands of genes in a single experiment . For these analyses , robotic equipment precisely places pieces of the pathogen 's DNA in an array of infinitesimally small droplets on glass microscope slides . <p> " We build and use these microarrays to compare and contrast DNA of various Campylobacter samples , " explains microbiologist Craig T. Parker . " We 're also using microarrays to get a snapshot of genes in action so that we can see when genes are turned on or off . " For example , Parker is pinpointing the genes that are active in helping Campylobacter overcome our bodies ' protective actions . By tracking the action of the microbes ' genes , Parker and co-investigators may be able to determine a way to derail them . <p> Though C. jejuni has grabbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also of interest . The Albany studies of C. coli , C. lari , and C. upsaliensis , for example , are attracting the attention of member nations in a threecontinent collaboration called " Campycheck , " formed to evaluate the importance of these lesser-known or newly emerging species . The Albany scientists and colleagues from the ARS Richard B. Russell Agricultural Research Center , Athens , Georgia , are advisors to Campycheck . <p> In clinical laboratories , these less-studied pathogens may inadvertently be killed by the antibiotics used to identify the better-known ones . The likely result ? An inaccurate picture of their prevalence and virulence . Campycheck may yield a detailed , accurate picture . <p> The Campylobacter studies in the United States and abroad might never completely eliminate the need for careful handling of raw poultry in our homes or the kitchens of school cafeterias , fine restaurants , and other eateries . But the research can reduce our chances of ever encountering this unruly microbe . <p> This research is part of Food Safety , an ARS National Program ( #108 ) described on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned in this story , contact Marcia Wood , USDA-ARS Information Staff , 5601 Sunnyside Ave. , Beltsville , MD 20705-5129 ; phone ( 301 ) 504-1662 , fax ( 301 ) 504-1641 . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Microarrays , or gene chips , enable scientists to get a quick look at thousands of genes in a single experiment .

A quick look at the specimens with a microarray assay ( see main story ) shows nd immediately apparent differences in their genes . But when you expose piglets  --  animals susceptible to this microbe  --  to the bacteria , one strain makes the animals ill , While the other affects them only mildly . <p> Why the difference ? <p> ARS food . safety researchers Craig T. Parker , at Albany , California , and colleague Michael E. Konkel at Washington State University in Pullman , are designing a series of experiments that should enable them to find out . What 's more , their work may help other scientists who are investigating the virulence of other major foodborne pathogens . <p> Even though their preliminary microarray scan failed to reveal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this technology offers another option  --  one that allows them to delve more deeply . <p> Instead of beginning with the microbe 's DNA , these followup assays begin with RNA  --  genetic material that 's formed when the DNA , or genes , becomes active . <p> In these tests , the scientists Will place the two strains in petri dishes with colonies of a type of human intestinal cell . Called epithelial cells , they 're the target of real-life Campylobacter attacks . The researchers will take samples of the two strains at successive intervals , looking for changes in RNA that occur over time . RNA extracted from the strains provides tell-tale evidence of genes that went into action . The work is much like that of police detectives who analyze evidence to reconstruct what really happened at a crime scene . The scientists use an enzyme called reverse transcriptase to match up the RNA to a version of the DNA from which it originated . Then , they use the microarray assay to discern the differences between that DNA and the microbe 's DNA as it existed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveal genes that were activated in the attack and genes that remained silent . <p> In earlier work at Pullman , collaborator Konkel uncovered one such C. jejuni gene . Named ciaB , short for Campylobacter invasion antigen B , it cues the microbe to secrete a similarly named protein , CiaB , which apparently plays a crucial role in enabling the bacterium to penetrate epithelial cells . Though undoubtedly key to C. jejuni 's invasions , it is unlikely to act alone . The West Coast scientists expect to uncover other genes that will lead them into the dark heart of Campylobacter 's virulence . Marcia Wood , ARS <p>
