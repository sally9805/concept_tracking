When David Bowie went through his R.-and-B. phase , they called it plastic soul . Now Neil Young is playing with the guys from Booker T. and the MGs , singing melodies ripped from the Otis Redding playbook , adding his own ragged guitar solos and flower-child lyrics : call it all-natural gra-soul-a . It 's nearly always a little too sweet , with Young 's voice reaching high to deliver heartfelt avowals of love tinged with sadness at the state of the world . A tightly professional backup of organ , mid-tempo drums and precise rhythm guitar keeps him from getting too wild and loose . But most songs go on for too long , and the rare tracks where he lets a little anger creep in , like Let 's Roll , his homage to the Sept. 11 passengers of Flight 93 , come as a welcome change . Too much sugar damages any dish , whether it 's rock or soul . <P>  --  By Benjamin Nugent                   @ @
