" WORDS OF WISDOM : " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was young , I would write the president and tell him " So this is what we 're going to do . ' In general , I 've always felt like , why not try ? And I found that when I asked , people kept saying yes . " WHAT YOU CAN DO : " The easiest thing to change is something we do on a daily basis .

I 've made a lot of good friends who knew me before I played golf . We go to movies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these days  --  and eat junk food . My only problem is that I eat too much of it . " Laura Bell Bundy She may be hot and young , but Laura Bell Bundy , who received a Tony nomination for her starring role as Elle Woods in the hysterically funny musical Legally Blonde ( the Reese Witherspoon part in the movie version ) , is already an old pro .
