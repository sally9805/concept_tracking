<p> To understand why couples , gay or straight , are drawn to country-and-western dancing , one only need perch on a barstool some evening at Charlie 's . <p> Charlie 's , 3726 N. Broadway , is a basic Boystown watering hole whose main distinction is it 's the only gay country bar in Chicago . For a few hours , anyway , and on certain days . On Mondays , Wednesdays , Fridays and Saturdays , from happy hour to 11-ish , pairs of men and pairs of women boot-scoot around the dance floor to the latest country hits and the occasional twangy classic . Country dance classes are taught Mondays and Wednesdays . But about an hour before midnight , Charlie 's switches over from country dance floor to standard gay disco . The music changes from yee-haw to thump-thump ; rhinestones and Wranglers give way to makeup and Mossimo . <p> The thing to notice , though , is how the dancing changes . As a country bar , most of the couples are cradling each other  --  hands held , eye contact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters . But as a disco it 's a free-for-all  --  hardly anyone is dancing together , glances are surreptitious , and everyone 's working really hard to look cool . <p> " I 've done all kinds of dancing , but I liked doing country dancing because you get to actually hold someone , " says Jim Edminster , a regular at the evening version of Charlie 's . " You have to hold someone . It 's just more ... human . " <p> Lee Fox , a Florida official with the International Association of Gay/Lesbian Country Western Dance Clubs , felt the same way when he started country dancing in 1991 . " Country music never appealed to me , even though I was raised in a small town in Georgia , " he says , " but actually to dance with a man in your arms , actually to have leading and following  --  that appealed to me . Before that , dancing was all about doing your own thing , but country-and-western dancing means two-steps and waltzes , where you can actually hold someone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may not surprise anyone that men in big hats are out there waltzing with other men . But it 's beyond even that now . Gay and lesbian country-and-western dancing comes out of the clubs this week and goes before the judges . For the first time in the event 's 24-year history , the Gay Games is presenting Country &; Western Dancing as a medal sport under the DanceSport classification . <p> On Monday afternoon at the Hilton Chicago , hundreds of same-sex couples from around the world will be two-stepping , line dancing and West Coast swinging as a competitive sport , and someone 's going home with a bolo tie and a gold medal around their necks . <p> ' Urban Cowboy ' set the pace <p> But " Brokeback , " believe it or not , had nothing to do with it . <p> " This all happened before ' Brokeback ' came out , " Fox says . He 's coordinating and judging the Country &; Western dance floor this week at the Gay Games VII in Chicago . ( In fact , he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancing , gay and straight , was two decades ago : " Urban Cowboy . " ) <p> " In March of last year , they approached us about coordinating a competition in Chicago , " Fox says , " and six months before that we 'd been contacted by the Out Games in Montreal a Canadian alternative to the Gay Games beginning July 26 . And we just had our annual convention on Memorial Day weekend . That 's three major competitions in three months . It 's a busy year . " <p> Some form of country or folk dancing has been a part of each Gay Games but always as entertainment . The first thing spectators saw at the 1982 inaugural Gay Games in San Francisco was the Foggy City Square Dancers performing in the opening ceremonies . Opening and closing ceremonies since have spotlighted cloggers and line dancers . <p> There will be some of that this year , too . An Evanston dance instructor , Country Bernie , will be showing off the talents of his senior citizens country dance troupe at a performance Monday amid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Chicago , but he 'll be dancing this week with his " mature " students from the Levy Senior Center , dancing Bernie 's own choreography to " Just a Gigolo . " <p> The competitors , however , have been practicing steps and polishing boots for a smaller audience : the judges . Monday 's competition involves couples and lines all on the dance floor at once , strutting their stuff for abbreviated country songs , then awaiting the judges ' scores . <p> It can be  --  as Gay Games opening ceremonies entertainer Margaret Cho said in a recent Sun-Times interview  --  vicious competition . <p> " I think this year they 're having square dancing , which is going to be vicious , " Cho said . " Square dancing is , to me , quite a terrifying kind of a sport because it 's all about these big skirts and these big dance moves that are done very fast and very quick . And I think that 's going to be the most hair-raising one to watch . " <p> It 's social , not sexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year 's Gay Games  --  just ballroom and country-western . Jim Edminster has been country dancing for nearly 15 years , with male and female dance partners . The country dancing , he decided , was more fun , less square . ( Couples decide who leads in advance . ) <p> " I started out in gay square dancing , in a big club in Chicago called the Chi Town Squares , " he says . " During intermissions , they would play country music and two-step . I 'm from Kansas , but I did n't know what that was . A friend started doing it , and it looked like fun , but I said , ' Is n't it possible to do this to some other kind of music ? ' I was not a country-western person , but one thing led to another and I decided I liked the country dancing better than the square dancing . I liked having the partner . " <p> Then Edminster explains the core of what this kind of dancing is all about . <p> " It 's social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has some semi-sexual tinge to it . But it 's not about that , " he says . " I 'm 61 . I 'm not Quasimodo or anything , but I 'm not Brad Pitt . My sister came to visit a few weeks ago . She 's a dance teacher , and I took her to Charlie 's . She said , ' I 've never seen anybody pick partners like you do . You get through with a dance , point to someone else , and they come dance with you . ' And I said , " Yeah , it 's ' cause I 'm a good dancer . It 's not ' cause I 'm good-looking , it 's ' cause I 'm good . ' It can be about hooking up and all that , and often at the bar it is , but it 's also a lot of fun , and when it 's gets to that level you want to be good . " <p> That 's when country dancing shuffles out of the bar and into competitive events . <p> Edminster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance partner Jamie Aubertin . This will be Aubertin 's first competition , but Edminster has competed in other country dance contests , gay and straight . Nowadays , though , the gay and lesbian country dancing has become so widespread and popular , there are more gay events to choose from . <p> " There are international events that draw thousands all the time , " Edminster says . " You could conceivably fly to a gay dancing convention all over the world every weekend . And some people do . In New York , there are so few straight dancers they wind up joining the gay clubs . " <p> Fashion counts in competition <p> Crystal Kimmey has been teaching country dancing classes to same-sex couples , mostly men , at Charlie 's for about five years . ( Elsewhere , she competes at gay and lesbian rodeos . ) " These boys take their dancing very seriously , " Kimmey says . <p> But at Charlie 's , she says , it 's more about the camaraderie . <p> " It 's half dance class , half social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boys  --  though it can be the seventh level of hell trying to find a line dance that pleases them . Half of them wo n't do a hip thrust . The other half wo n't do a clap-side shuffle  --  because they think it makes them look too gay . <p> " But it 's a pretty loyal crowd , some of the friendliest people I 've met in the world . And the whole country-western mentality is welcoming . ... It 's not , ' Oh , who 's wearing the best boots tonight , is that Wrangler ? ' That 's not what matters . It 's , ' Can you dance ? ' " <p> Although , when it comes to competing , the costume is part of it . <p> " It 's a chance to buy really obnoxious shirts , " Edminster chuckles . " And hats . I never wear a cowboy hat when I 'm dancing  --  I think it 's silly  --  but , as the lead , I have to for competition . " <p> The rules also mandate a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , denim jeans and cowboy boots . <p> " Partners tend to get clothes that are sets . You learn that the judges disregard all glitter and fringes ; that 's not what they 're looking for , " Edminster says . " We usually get costumes that center on two dominant colors . If you wear something too intricate and colorful , like embroidery , it messes with the judge 's eye movement . They ca n't follow you as well . " <p> Fox adds , " In the Country &; Western category , you of course want to do something more than the regular cowboy hat and jeans . Most of them fancy up their shirts somehow . ... Dress is part of the judging , but the fanciest costume is n't going to make you win . <p> " The costuming can be fun , but the fact that a crowd of people stands around and watches and cheers for you  --  that 's a big thrill and a turn-on . It 's a whole new world , no matter who you 're dancing with . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GOLD : The Country &; Western Dancing competition at the Gay Games VII takes place between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m .
