OUTDOORS Headnote Make a summer escape to the West 's most beautiful lakes Photograph Cool and blue : Priest Lake is the least developed of northern Idaho 's trio of lakes . // The lakes of northern Idaho-Coeur d'Alene , Pend Oreille , and Priest-are deep , blue , and busy . Scooped out during the Ice Age , the lakes now float yachts and kayaks . On the green shores , towns draw visitors to high-end resorts , restaurants , and lakefront bicycle trails . Each lake has its legend : Native Americans told stories of monsters I in Coeur d'Alene Lake ; another monster , the Pend Oreille Paddler , is to inhabit Lake Pend Oreille ; and Priest Lake is linked to 1920s actress and filmmaker Nell Shipman , who established a wildermovie studio in what is now Lionhead State Park . And each lake has a distinct personality . As my family ( husband , son , and daughter ) and I discover , Coeur d'Alene Lake is bustling with boaters , golfers , and resorts . Further north , Lake Pend Oreille is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern shore , provides a more intimate , small-town experience . Square in the panhandle , Priest Lake offers calm water , thick cedar forests , and seclusion-with huckleberry pie to boot . Photograph Clockwise from top : Pilot Grant Brooks parks his seaplane on Coeur d'Alene Lake ; on Priest Lake , fire warms the dusk ; Hill 's Resort cabins are tucked into the woods ; their interiors glow with Wild West charm . // Logging mills to links : Coeur d'Alene Lake When French trappers came through this area about 200 years ago , they called the native people Coeur d'Alene- " awl heart " - so impressed were they by the tribe 's sharp trading skills . Eventually , Coeur d'Alene the town became known for logging and mining , and for more than a century it was a gritty place . No more . Now the lake and the town draw golfers and boaters from Seattle and Los Angeles . As my kids and I bicycle the 24-mile North Idaho Centennial Trail , which runs along the lake , we see a shoreline dominated by the 18-story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yacht-filled marina . There 's also an 18-hole golf course with a floating green at the 14th hole . Down at Coeur d'Alene City Park , a carnival atmosphere prevails : A man in a muscle shirt walks a Pekingese dog , a bride and groom pose for pictures , and families , like ours , dip their feet into the cool water . At nearby Independence Point , we board the Coeur d'Alene to tour the 25-mile long , 120-foot-deep lake as the breeze whips our hair and osprey dive into the water . ( Another option is to see the lake by air , on one of Grant Brooks 's seaplane tours-these include 20-minute flights over Lake Coeur d'Alene , and longer trips over Lake Pend Oreille and other nearby lakes . ) We end our day sauntering along Sherman Avenue ( named for General William Tecumseh Sherman , the namesake of the fort that is now City Park ) , with its art galleries and espresso shops . We are tempted by the Huddy burgers at Hudson 's downtown , but daunted by the crowds-so instead we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tony Cedars Floating Restaurant . Lake Pend Oreille : art galleries , kayaks , and a restored theater Forty-six miles north of Coeur d'Alene on U.S. 95 , we cross the 2-mile Long Bridge into Sandpoint , at the northern end of 43-mile-long Lake Pend Oreille . Some think French trappers named this lake for the ear pendants worn by the Kalispel Indians ; others think the name describes the lake 's hook shape . We drive through downtown Sandpoint , which , with its boutiques , espresso shops , art galleries , and restaurants , has the mellow atmosphere of a university town without the university . These days Sandpoint is most famous for Coldwater Creek . The women 's clothing company is headquartered here and has a store in town ; nearby are the shops of Cedar Street Bridge , Sandpoint 's answer to Florence 's Ponte Vecchio . I slip off to do some shopping while everyone else goes for a leisurely swim at City Beach . That evening we have dinner at Hydra , a small house turned restaurant , then see a series of short animated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Renovated thanks to the hard work of Sandpoint residents , it 's one of the most beautiful little movie palaces in the West . To see the lake the next morning , my kids and my husband board the Shawnodese riverboat at City Beach . I choose a quieter alternative : a kayak tour with Jason Wiley of Full Spectrum Tours . As we paddle , the Selkirk and Cabinet Mountains shimmering in the distance , it 's hard to imagine the violence of the Ice Age floods that scoured out this 1,150-foot-deep lake . I dip my paddle in and out , and I 'm reminded of the lake that Sandpoint native Marilynne Robinson describes in her novel Housekeeping-of water that seems " spread over half the world . " This is a vast lake indeed , a fact recognized by the Navy in World War II , when it tested submarines in the deep water near today 's 4,000-acre Farragut State Park .

Photograph The Cedors Floating Restaurant // Hiking and stargazing at Priest Lake We continue on to Priest Lake , the most northerly and least developed of the three . The 25-mile-long waterway is actually two lakes connected by a 2-mile river known as the Thoroughfare . On the lower lake 's Luby Bay , we pull into Hill 's Resort , with its forest cabins , 18-hole golf course , and views of the Selkirk Mountains . Owned by the Hill family since 1946 , the resort has hosted generations of families . " Each year , " says owner Teri Hill , " people arrive in the lobby , look out at the lake , sigh , and say , I 'm home .

Water laps placidly against the lake 's shore , the air is pine-scented , the night sky bright with stars , and we , too , feel that we have come home . // Idaho lakes Daytime temperatures warm to the mid-80s , but keep a sweater handy , as temperatures can drop to the 60s at nighttime .
