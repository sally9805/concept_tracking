<p> Cathryn Creasy has a notebook full of letters from creditors that she plans to carry around for the rest of her life . <p> Though it 's been a while since the Snellville woman was victimized , she is still afraid to write a check . <p> The 77-year-old has been trying to keep her name clear since her identity was stolen in 2005 by a crew of bandits . The crew was led by an enterprising transvestite who had a phony driver 's license with Creasy 's name and address . <p> " I was getting letters from collection agencies every day , " Creasy said . " It was just trouble after trouble . " <p> Now Creasy carries the creditors ' letters in case she has to prove herself  --  her identity . <p> Hundreds of Gwinnettians each year have stories similar to Creasy 's . Identity theft can lead to lifelong credit issues . And in Gwinnett , often it 's up to the victim to solve the crime . <p> Some experts have dubbed identity theft the fastest-growing crime in America . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3.6 million American households had been victimized by identity theft in a six-month period in 2004 , the latest year of the study . <p> " As we move more and more of our transactions online and onto credit cards , it is just leaving opportunities for the seedy part of society , " said Dean Dabney , associate professor of criminology at Georgia State University . " And it seems that lately , there has been an explosion of these opportunities . " <p> The crime 's volume has taken a toll on local police agencies . Gwinnett police said they get about 120 new identity theft cases a month , which brings in a parade of victims faster than detectives can solve the crimes . And in some cases , they do n't get solved . <p> Along with identity theft cases , the eight detectives in the Gwinnett police Electronic and Financial Crimes Unit can get another 180 white-collar style crimes a month , police said . For that reason , police say identity-theft victims should be prepared to be their own investigator . <p> " The sheer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always allow us to serve everyone who becomes a victim of these crimes , " said Gwinnett Sgt. W.F. Jack , a supervisor in the Electronic and Financial Crimes Unit . <p> " It will normally take a true victim at least 80 hours of work on their own in addition to the investigation by police . " <p> If a case is not assigned to a detective , Gwinnett police send the victim a letter detailing other options , such as pursuing the suspect in civil court , Jack said . <p> The cases can involve a few hundred dollars or reach into the thousands . <p> The thieves that stole Creasy 's identity went on a $1,700 spending spree , but for other victims the loss is much greater . <p> Gwinnett police recently investigated a woman who stole her father 's identity and used several credit cards to charge up to $50,000 . The woman , who police plan to arrest on 11 felony warrants , had moved into her 72-year-old father 's home to help him recover from an accident where he 'd lost both his legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was stealing people 's mail and using the information to open checking accounts under the victim 's identities . <p> Many times police detectives have to retrace the steps of a criminal 's shopping spree , and that can take them all over metro Atlanta , sometimes all over the country . <p> " If a resident of Gwinnett County reports to us that his or her identity was stolen in Tacoma , Wash. , we take the report , " Jack said . " Gwinnett County police can not be expected to actually investigate the crime since it occurred several states away . We would love to be able to assist everyone who is a victim . " <p> Sometimes local police departments handle the cases . Still , Lilburn police detective Kim Banks says , " It usually is a large investigation . " <p> And " they usually take a long time to solve , " Banks said . <p> Theft ring discovered <p> In Creasy 's case , Snellville police were able to find the suspects who they believed victimized her . <p> Creasy says in late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement . She called her bank and realized that somebody had stolen her identity . At about the same time , she got a call from a vigilant security guard at a department store . The security guard said that a woman had just purchased $500 worth of merchandise using checks with Creasy 's name and address . <p> The security guard jotted down the woman 's tag number and gave that information to the Snellville police . <p> This began an investigation that led Snellville investigators into DeKalb and Clayton counties . Snellville police arrested five suspects who apparently ran a huge identity-theft ring that victimized Creasy and hundreds of others , Snellville police Chief Roy Whitehead said . <p> " Every time we arrested one suspect , it would lead us someplace else , " Whitehead said . <p> The identity-theft crew had a person who worked in a check clearinghouse , a place where checks went before being deposited in the bank , Whitehead said . That person would steal the victim 's information from their checks . Then the group would create their own checks , credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The investigation got so large , Snellville police had to hand it over to the Secret Service , Whitehead said . The suspects will face charges in Gwinnett , but the case has not yet gone to trial . <p> One of the suspects , Michelle Kraus , a transvestite who police said had his name legally changed to a woman 's name , had a driver 's license with his picture and Creasy 's name and address . <p> It was an experience that Creasy does n't want to relive . <p> " I can laugh about it now , " Creasy said . <p> " But it was a real exasperating time .
