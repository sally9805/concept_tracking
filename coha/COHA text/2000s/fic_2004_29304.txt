Chapter One I am lying facedown on the leather-padded massage table clad immodestly in my heather-gray briefs while a curvaceous masseuse in a rather abbreviated nurse 's uniform strokes my left hand , one finger at a time . Seductive music-Ravel 's Bolero , I believe-floats on the jasmine-scented air . Lest you think you walked in on an opiate-induced pipe dream , let me state that I am in the offices of Touch Therapy-A New-Age Approach to Subliminal Relaxation and Human Bonding . This enterprising establishment is located on a pricey stretch of Via Bethesda in pricey Palm Beach , Florida . My auburn-tressed bonding therapist is called Bunny . Probably no relation to Mr. Hefner 's crew , but in her Florence Nightingale attire she looks ready to join the warren . We are in the converted family room of a former dwelling that has been stripped of all amenities except for a plush rug , the table , a couch that becomes a bed at the flip of a lever , and the type of screen one finds in doctors ' offices . Bunny instructs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table and concentrate on my navel . Well , I think she said navel . With that she leaves the room . I note the room has another door behind the screen , and it is from this door Bunny emerges , materializing from behind the screen like a benevolent specter . She takes hold of my hand , raises my arm , then releases her grip . My arm remains rigid . " Tense , tense , tense , Mr. Davis . That will never do . Go limp , go limp , " she implores . Again she raises my arm and lets go . This time I allow it to sag somewhat . " Better , " she sighs , " but not much . We have a long way to go , Mr. Davis . " She fiddles with my fingers then runs a cool hand down my spine , vertebra by vertebra ; when she reaches the bottom she giggles . " Oh , Mr. Davis , you naughty man . " I assume she has just noticed the elastic waistband of my shorts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being tempted by the serpent . Quite adorable , actually . I sense the moment has come . If Bunny is a licensed masseuse , I am Linus Pauling . " Your lovely receptionist told me you offered three human bonding techniques to achieve total subliminal relaxation , " I tell her . " That 's correct , Mr. Davis . Her name , by the way , is Honey . For three hundred dollars we perform the standard hands-on bonding . For double that sum , we offer a more intense approach wherein the therapist interacts with the client in the buff , so to speak . " " In the buff ? You or the client ? " " For a thousand dollars , Mr. Davis , I open the specially designed therapy couch and it 's your call . Honey , by the way , is also a skilled therapist . For two thousand dollars we work as a team . Now if you 'll roll over ... " " Oh , I could n't do that , Bunny . " " Come , come , Mr. Davis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to relieve the tension . We 'll begin with a simple hands-on and work up from there . " " Well , if you insist , Bunny . " I roll over , she gawks , then screams . " There , there , Bunny , nothing to be afraid of . " I reach into my shorts and pull out the transmitter . " Welcome to Candid Radio . We 're on the air to several witnesses in my office and being recorded as well . Would you like to give us a few choruses of Love For Sale ? " " Why , you ... " " Easy , Bunny . The technicians must bleep all expletives . " " What the hell do you want from me ? " " Glad you asked , " I say . " For starters , I want the snaps you took of Mr. Randolph Seymour as the two of you bonded on the Castro convertible . You remember , Bunny , the ones you wanted to sell to Mr. Seymour for ten thousand bucks or , should he refuse , give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and Honey to fold up your massage table and move on . I intend to give your radio performance , which includes the Touch Therapy menu , to the police in twenty-four hours . " Looking around , I added , " By the way , where is your photographer ? I 'm guessing behind the screen . Hi , Honey , come out , come out , wherever you are . " " Who the hell are you ? " Bunny cries , still slightly dazed . A transmitter is the last thing she expects to see popping out of my shorts . Honey comes flying out from behind the screen waving the business card she had no doubt taken from the wallet I had foolishly left in the inside pocket of my jacket . " His name is n't Davis , " Honey bellows , " it 's McNally . Archy McNally , Discreet Inquirer . " Chapter Two ( From the Palm Beach Daily News ) JACKET REQUIRED Interview and Photography by Michael Price Editor 's Note : This is a weekly series of question-and-answer portraits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects will all be photographed wearing the vintage Lilly Pulitzer blazer Price rescued from a thrift shop 10 years ago .

Chapter Three Tennis Everyone ! It was the height of the season in Palm Beach , where anyone knows a benefit a day keeps ennui away . After the previous night 's encounter with Bunny and Honey and their traveling circus , a bit of good clean fund-raising was just what I needed to restore my faith in humankind . Malcolm MacNiff 's Tennis Everyone ! has long been the town 's premier fund raiser for those who can afford to fork over five thousand bucks for the privilege of donning their tennis togs ( white only on the court , please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one grass . Nifty , as he was called at St. Paul 's and still is because boys who prep together stick together , opens his courts once a year for his private scholarship fund benefiting deserving high school graduates who would otherwise never see the inside of a college lecture hall . Nifty 's backyard courts cover five prime acres on the west side of S. Ocean Boulevard . The downside of being on the west side of the Boulevard is that you have to cross it to get to the beach . The upside is that were you wise as well as rich , you tunneled under the highway , thereby proving the mathematical axiom about a straight line being the shortest distance between two points . The gates to the tunnel were invitingly open on this tropical winter day , but no one seemed eager to leave the party for a stroll on the beach . Tennis Everyone ! redefines " exclusive . " Only one hundred check writers in white can indulge in an afternoon of doubles involving both mixed couples , and ladies only and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to report that those chosen to participate in Nifty 's tennis marathon are summoned by a higher power but , alas , this being Palm Beach they are summoned by a coveted invitation from Mr. and Mrs. Malcolm MacNiff . That 's correct . By invitation . So popular is Nifty 's fund-raiser that only those carefully selected by the MacNiffs can give them five grand for the privilege of whacking the hell out of a Spaulding wrapped in fuzzy wool . The uninvited do n't dare show their faces in town on the day of Nifty 's event . The boutiques on Worth Avenue are empty of shoppers and the ladies who lunch are stricken with the vapors or suddenly remember pressing engagements in Nepal and Zimbabwe . The event 's main attraction is usually a tennis superstar , and today 's chosen was none other than the enfant terrible of the pro circuit , Jackson ( Jackie ) Barnett . The six-foot-two blond with the looks of a comic strip hero and the temper of a two-year-old was garnering all the attention of the stargazers this afternoon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheered , then chased all over London by a titled lady who did or did not catch him , depending on the tabloid you read . He had been offered a million dollars for a five-minute cameo in the film version of this year 's best-selling novel and , most notably , he was applauded by spectators when he flung to the ground the racket that bore his name when it , not the player , failed to answer an opponent 's volley . Jackie 's name was tossed into the hopper , just like the common folks , so his partners or opponents were strictly the luck of the draw and , to be sure , it was a great party booster each time Nifty pulled the names out of the hat to arrange the foursomes . Ladies who teamed with Jackie screamed when their names were called ; the gentlemen , similarly honored , were obliged to square their shoulders and stiffen their upper lips . Losers could look forward to the next lottery , keeping all in a state of happy expectation . Me ? I 'm Archy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a higher power , namely , my father , the CEO of McNally &; Son , Attorney-at-Law . As representatives of the MacNiff interests we are always on the invited list . Like most firms doing business in Palm Beach , we are forced to subscribe to several charity events each season , though Tennis Everyone ! is one of the few I would be sorry to miss . Although my serve leaves something to be desired and my backhand has been referred to as weak , I have a great pair of legs-and in Palm Beach it 's the visuals that matter . When not at play , guests are invited to nosh at the enormous catered smorgasbord featuring the alpha and omega of party food : grilled filet mignon , sliced by a master carver before your very eyes ; poached salmon ; pheasant ; fried chicken ; foie gras ; caviar ; deviled eggs ; every garnish , dip and crudit known to man , including ketchup and mustard for the burgers and hot dogs . Who said the rich are n't catholic in their tastes ? There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the property so that one was never out of sight of a gin and tonic or the young lads and lassies who serve , bus and look so splendid in their black pants , white shirts and black bow ties . Among them I spotted Todd , who waits tables at the Pelican Club on busy Saturday nights . Todd was christened Edward but redubbed himself in anticipation of a career on the silver screen . I do n't think Todd is any improvement over Edward , but it beats Jeb , Rock or Rip . Like many young folks in the surrounding communities , namely Lake Worth and West Palm Beach , Todd survives by toiling for the caterers and restaurants that abound in our upscale resort . While I had n't yet been paired with or against Jackie Barnett , I did get called for the mixed doubles and found myself with a very attractive lady introduced as Holga von Brecht . The von made me wonder if she was a titled lady of German descent , though her accent was strictly New England Yankee . I guessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these days she could have been a decade older and either well preserved or well connected to a surgeon with hands of gold . We were opposite a young man named Joe Gallo and his partner , Vivian Emerson , who was a good deal older than Joe but , like Holga , a looker with a figure to match . Why the name Joe Gallo struck a chord I had no idea and , chosen to serve , did n't have time to ponder the mystery . We played the allotted three sets and Holga and I took two of them . When we shook hands across the net I believe Vivian shot daggers at Holga . This being Palm Beach I immediately jumped to the conclusion that Joey belonged to Vivian and Holga was trying to make some points that had nothing to do with tennis . Ho-hum and pardon my lack of interest . Later I drew an all-male foursome and was paired with Lance Talbot , a young man of sudden great wealth , due to his maternal grandmother 's demise . Grandmama was the daughter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Fords , Chryslers , Dodges and Fishers . I recalled that Lance and his grandmother were estranged for years but it seems they kissed and made up just in time to keep Lance a member in good standing of the jet set . Palm Beach is chock-full of such heartwrenching tales . We were opposite Nifty himself and , if I had heard correctly , a man Nifty introduced as Darling . This I believe was the gentleman 's surname unless , of course , Nifty was taking liberties with the guy , which I doubted . Nifty and Darling took all three sets . " I liked your interview in ' Jacket Required , ' " Lance complimented me when we parted company . Dark crew cut , blue eyes and a physique that bespoke a personal trainer , Lance Talbot was the answer to a working maiden 's prayer . I was also amazed that he took notice of the likes of me . " Thanks . I assume you 'll be tapped for the honor in the near future , " I told him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not as clever as you , Mr. McNally . " With that he pulled a cell phone out of the pocket of his tennis shorts and proceeded to make a call . Really ! Not sure if I had been praised or panned by young Talbot I beckoned to Todd , who proffered his tray of goodies . " Juice ? " he asked . " No , thanks , I hear it can rust your pipes , " I answered , reaching for a gin and tonic . " How goes it , Todd ? " " Working my tail off , Mr. McNally . Jeff is supposed to be bussing this station with me but he went for a smoke a half hour ago and I have n't seen him since . " An ex-smoker myself , I imagined Jeff had most likely escaped via the tunnel and was now on the beach , happily puffing away . " When he gets back , take a break , " I advised the aspiring thespian . " You certainly deserve it . " I saw a familiar figure at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear all the news that 's not fit to print .
