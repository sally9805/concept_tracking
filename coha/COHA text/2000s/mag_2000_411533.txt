Dear Dr. Cory : Why do we need fingernails and toenails ? Ashley Masters-jackson Indianapolis , Indiana Dear Ashley : Nails protect the sensitive ends of our fingers and toes . Fingernails help to give a strong base for the skin to press against when we touch something . And they help us do some things more easily , such as untying knots or scratching . Can you imagine having an itch and no fingernails ? Dear Dr. Cory : // When babies sneeze , snot does n't come out of their nose.Why ? Alexandra Thibeaux Cedar Hill , Texas Dear Alexandra : Cold viruses usually make the mucus in our nose thick , green , and runny . Although parents try to protect their babies from colds , they still get them.You probably have not seen a baby sneeze green mucus because we sneeze for a variety of reasons , not just when we have colds . Sneezing is a protective action , or a reflex.We do it without thinking.Things like dust , dirt , smoke , and pollen can cause us to sneeze . Sneezing helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , out of our nose and lungs.When we sneeze for those reasons , it is usually little droplets of clear mucus rather than the thick mucus we get with colds . Dear Dr. Cory : How and why do you have a heart attack ? Taryn Morgan Windsor , Missouri Dear Taryn : Just like every other muscle in your body , your heart needs nutrients and oxygen.The blood in the coronary arteries brings both of these to the heart . A heart attack occurs when a blood clot blocks the flow of blood in the coronary arteries . When this blockage occurs , the oxygen supply to that part of the heart is cut off . As a result , the heart muscle in that particular area dies . If a large area of the heart is afFected , the whole heart stops beating.When the heart stops working , the rest of the body no longer receives the blood carrying nutrients and oxygen.The result is that the body dies . Usually the clot that causes a heart attack forms in a coronary artery.The clot develops where the walls of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposits.This condition , called atherosclerosis , is a form of heart disease . Fatty deposits begin accumulating in childhood , build up over the years , and cause dangerous thickening of the coronary vessels . Several factors contribute to developing plaque deposits , including being overweight , lack of exercise , high cholesterol levels in the blood , high blood pressure , and smoking . High levels of the amino acid homocysteine may also damage blood vessels . Reduce Your Risk Heart disease is the number one cause of death for both men and women.You can help reduce your risk of heart disease by adopting a healthy lifestyle that includes the following : Eat a heart-healthy diet that consists of lots of fresh fruits , vegetables , whole grains , legumes , and protein from fish , lean meats , skinless poultry , and lowfat dairy products . Eat less of the saturated fats found in fatty meats and full-fat dairy products . Eat less " trans fats ; " found in many fast foods , most margarines , and packaged foods listing " partially hydrogenated oil . " Turn off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if you 're just going for a walk .
