The late spring rain was heavy and chill . Some of it was seeping through the roof where the thatch was worn . The fire had gone out the day before , and the two children did not know how to restart it . They huddled together to keep warm . Their mother 's body lay on the bed amid a pool of blood that was now congealed and blackening . The stench in the cottage had already numbed their nostrils , even as the cold had numbed their fingers and toes . The wind suddenly howled in mournful fashion , and the smaller of the two children whimpered , pressing himself closer to his elder sister . Rhonwyn uerch Llywelyn focused her brain again as she had these past two days . How was she to save Glynn and herself from certain death ? Their mama was dead , birthing the prince 's latest child . Their cottage was isolated from any village , for decent women would not tolerate the prince 's whore and his bastards . The old crone who had helped Vala in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because this time the child had come too soon . Much too soon . They needed to be warm , Rhonwyn thought sleepily . How did one start a fire ? If only it would cease raining . Perhaps they could walk and find another cottage or villagebut whatever a village was for she did n't really know , having never left the hill on which she had lived her whole five years . Rhonwyn hugged her three-year-old brother tighter against her when he whimpered again . " Hungry , " he complained to her . " There is nothing left , Glynn , " she repeated for the tenth time . " When the rain stops we will go and find food . If we leave the cottage now , we will surely die . " They wereapt to die in any event , Rhonwyn thought irritably . If she could only start a fire to warm them , the gnawing in their bellies might not seem so fierce . She had n't meant for the fire to go out , but when her mam began screaming with her pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would not be frightened . They had gone out on the hillside to pick flowers for the new baby . But when they had returned their mother was dead , and the fire was out . Not even a lingering coal remained that Rhonwyn might coax into a warm flame as she had often seen her mother do . Then the rain had begun . It had rained all night and into this day , which was al-most over . Suddenly Rhonwyn 's ears pricked up at the sound of dogs baying in the distance . The noise grew closer and closer until it was directly outside . The door to the cottage was slammed open , and Llywelyn ap Gruffydd was outlined in the fading light of day . He stepped quickly inside , his eyes sweeping about the room . Seeing his children huddled together on their pallet , he asked them , " What has happened here ? " " Mam 's dead , " Rhonwyn answered her father . " The new baby came too soon . " " Why was n't the midwife here ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ? And where is she ? Mam was screaming and screaming . I took Glynn and went outside . When we returned Mam was dead . There was no fire . No food . I did n't know what to do . I did n't know where to go , or I would have gone . Our mam is dead , and you and your rutting have killed her ! She would not have died but that you put another baby in her belly . " Startled at the venom in the child 's voice , he looked down at her , seeing his daughter for the first time . It was like looking into a glass but for her coloring , which was Vala 's . She did n't like him , he knew . Her green eyes glared angrily into his . He would have laughed but for the seriousness of the situation . Rhonwyn was certainly his get and every bit as intense with her anger as he was . " I 'll make a fire , " he replied . " Go outside and look in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not mind the dogs . " He turned away from her and began to prepare a new fire . Seeing his small son staring at him , half fearful , half curious , he said , " Come here , lad , and I will show you how to make a fire so you will never be cold again . " The little boy crept from the pallet and came to stand by his father , watching fascinated as ap Gruffydd gathered a bit of kindling together and drew a flint from his purse . Using the blade of his knife , the prince stroked the flint until it sparked , and the kindling caught light . Glynn 's eyes were wide with amazement , and the prince smiled , reaching out to ruffle the boy 's dark hair . Ap Gruffydd added wood to the fire until it was blazing merrily , and the chill began to dissipate . The man stood and handed the flint to his son . " ' T is yours , Glynn ap Llywelyn . Now you know how to make a fire , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Aye , Tad " came the reply , and the prince smiled again . It was the first time the child had called him father . " So , you know I am your sire , " he said . " Mam said , " the child answered simply . " She did not lie , God assoil her sweet soul . " Now the prince 's attention was drawn back to his dead lover . She must be buried , although no priest would say the proper words over her . It did n't matter . God would have Vala uerch Huw because she was a good woman . He would not condemn her to a fiery hell because she had been Llywelyn ap Gruffydd 's leman . He wished now he had married her , even though she had had neither wealth nor powerful family ties to recommend her . At least his children would have been legitimate . Well , he would formally acknowledge them . That would please Vala . He should begin to consider marriage , he thought . He was well past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry on his name . Rhonwyn had reentered the cottage . She took bread and cheese , making small pieces for her little brother . Seeing the flint , she said , " What 's that ? " She picked it up and rolled the quartz in her hand gently . " Give it back ! " Glynn shouted at her . " Our tad gave it to me . It makes fire . " Rhonwyn shrugged and handed him back his prize . " Was the baby born ? " ap Gruffydd asked his daughter . She shrugged . " I do n't know , " she replied , shoving bread and cheese into her mouth . " I did n't look . " He nodded , understanding . He would have to look . " Has the rain stopped yet , Rhonwyn ? " " Aye . " " I 'll go and dig a grave for yer mam , " he said . " Put it where she can see the sunset , " the little girl said . " Mam always liked to watch the sunset . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the side of the cottage nearest Vala 's garden , he sought for a westerly direction . The storm had gone , and the skies were clearing now . Finding the right spot , he began to dig . What was he to do with his children ? he considered as he worked . While there was a truce between him and the English for now , there was still no place he really called home . Besides , it would be far better if as few people as possible knew of these two little ones . Even bastards had their relevance . They could be exploited by his enemies or used to cement treaties . Particularly as he had no other children . He had been faithful to Vala , for he had little time for his own amusement . Besides , there had never been a woman who pleased him like this descendant of the Fair Folk had .
