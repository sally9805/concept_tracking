THE FUNDRAISER 'S NAME was Lee Ann Mercer and she wanted to go dancing . It was one of those late spring Friday nights when the wind was warm and wet and the air smelled like an overly chlorinated pool and everyone wanted to do something they had n't in too long a time . The real estate agent and his wife turned off their television and went to get passed-out drunk at a bar with an outdoor patio . The too-young married couple with too many too-young children decided to hire a sitter and go see a movie that was not animated or a musical . The widower , who had practically lived in his bathrobe since his wife had died , put on a plaid blazer and a tie and said , " Let 's do something , " to no one in particular . And Lee Ann Mercer , who was hosting her annual fundraising party for university alumni at her house at 107 Strawberry Lane , could hear music drifting from somewhere down the street and decided that she was going to go dancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine in the kitchen , next to the back door , and considered the implications of her impending departure . Her boss was in the house , somewhere-chatting up all the wealthy white-haired men wearing tan bucks and linen jackets , their wives in overly fancy yellow sundresses-and Lee Ann had the fleeting thought that he would resent her leaving her own party and thus violating the terms of her contract-not just as a hostess , but as a university fundraiser who was expected to put on and stay put at these kinds of functions . Plus , she was expecting someone in particular at the party : a thirty-nine-year-old alumnus from Raleigh , North Carolina , an ex-studio arts major and heir to his daddy 's video poker fortune who lived by himself in a loft apartment with stacks of New York art magazines stretched well toward the ceiling and who regularly teased Lee Ann with promises of behemoth bequests to the university but thus far had not delivered . The last time Lee Ann had visited him-a month or so earlier-she had been in the middle of explaining his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , new goal posts-when the alumnus had kissed her , full on the mouth , and , to her surprise , she kissed him back , and wanted to do so again immediately after and now , too , even though he was a dilettante who left one too many buttons on his shirt unbuttoned and whose teeth were surprisingly crooked and jack-o ' - lantern- like for a rich man . The alumnus-his name was Barry-had responded to her party invitation in writing , saying that he would come to the party and that he had a big surprise for her . Lee Ann did not want to miss his arrival . <p> But no , Lee Ann quickly decided , she would not be missed : she would dance her way up and down the street , from house to house , and then slip back into her own house and no one would know the difference . " I have n't been dancing in ages , " she told herself . Just then , she heard her boss 's voice booming from somewhere in the house , and she quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , past the cigarette smokers . When the smokers asked where she was going , she rattled her glass and said , " Ice , " then stepped out onto the street and into the night . <p> On the street she stopped and listened for a moment . There was music playing from somewhere-Glenn Miller , Tommy Dorsey , someone with a big band from before she was born-and she did a happy little hip-shaking shuffle down the street as she mapped her route . First , the Merrills , then the Yerinas , the Hammonds , the Cheevers , the Morriseys ; then , at the cul-de-sac , she would dance down the other side of the street , the Howards , the Charneys , the Lius , and finally the Parks ' house , right across from her own . Lee Ann took in a deep breath . The air no longer smelled like chlorine but rather of sweet pesticide from the town 's mobile bug fogger , but still the smell was chemical , and the sky was black and deep and it was the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had just seen a movie on the climbing of Mount Everest and so felt something of the adventurer in herself , and she anticipated that she might , someday , tell stories about the night she danced her way up and down Strawberry Lane . <p> Lee Ann was not an impulsive woman , nor did she consider herself untrustworthy ; but she was n't above lying to herself on occasion , either . For instance , she lied to herself about her house all the time , and the lying did not trouble her much . Lee Ann lived in the house with two dogs and a husband . The house itself was fifteen years old and had white vinyl siding and black shutters and pillars that were not really pillars at all , but rather two thirty-foot strips of whitewashed pine that stretched from front entrance to roof . They were not pillars , officially , because they did n't actually support the roof . " Those pillars could n't hold up me or you , " the contractor had told her when he was building the house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ann had said . <p> " Exactly , " the contractor had agreed . " Those things do n't do shit . " <p> " Understood , " Lee Ann had told him . Nonetheless , she called the strips of wood pillars , and she also referred to her home as being lake-front property , even though the lake was only a dammed-up river and even though the water was so low that one had to muck through fifty feet of mucusy red clay before one got to the lake itself , which the EPA said was too dangerously polluted to swim in anyway , especially if you were pregnant . Lee Ann Mercer was not pregnant , but one of her dogs , a blockheaded black lab named Labbie , had gotten pregnant , and had given birth to the second dog , a runtish black-and-gray mutt that Lee Ann had not bothered to name and refused to let in the house . The dog roamed and smelled like fish . When her neighbors complained about the mutt , who barked at night , all night , Lee Ann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she could n't take any responsibility for it . <p> So Lee Ann lied about her dog , and she also lied about her husband , Teddy . Lee Ann 's husband had paid for the building of the house when they had moved from Connecticut to South Carolina some fifteen years earlier , but he barely lived in it . He was the chair of the biology department at the university . Usually , when not stopping off at the house to nurse his broken heart or beg Lee Ann 's forgiveness or check his mail , he lived with one of his female graduate assistants . But for a while now , Lee Ann 's husband had lived with the slutty manager of the bar he frequented and often , when drunk , talked of buying . He had n't been home for several months . When neighbors asked about Teddy , Lee Ann merely said that he was busy at work but was otherwise fine , absolutely fine . <p> There was one more thing that Lee Ann lied about : her name . It was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught fourth grade at a private elementary school in Stonington , Connecticut . Her husband 's name was not Teddy but Ted . He 'd taught biology at a private women 's college in New London . Katherine and Ted were happy . They were ! They were happiest when they walked the grounds of their highly mortgaged property and patted the Revolutionary-era stone walls and threw sticks for Labbie . The sticks were birch-no other kind of stick would do-and in her fourth-grade class , Katherine taught her students how the Nipmuck Indians had made canoes out of birch bark , and her students marveled at the native intelligence of the Indians . The descendants of those Indians were now supervising the slot machines a half hour away at the Foxwoods Casino , but Katherine did not mention this to her students , who were too young to appreciate how short the distance was from ingenuity to stupefaction . <p> But then Ted applied , interviewed for , and accepted a job at Clemson University in South Carolina . He did all of this without consulting Katherine first . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katherine objected . Katherine simply stood there and glared at her husband . They had been married for six years , and this was the first time that her husband had said anything remotely like " You 'll get over it . " Katherine felt like she had been duped , conned into marrying the wrong man . " You 'll get over it , " she said , and then spat on the ancient knotty-pine floor of their bedroom , driving her husband from the room . Once he was gone , Katherine jammed her clothes into their suitcases and then spat on the suitcases , too . <p> Katherine became further enraged once they reached Clemson , because suddenly there were no more ancient , meandering stone walls and birch trees , and suddenly everything was air conditioning and the Lost Cause and school fight songs and Jesus bumper stickers on jacked-up pick-ups with running boards , and suddenly being " Katherine " seemed unbearably quaint , hopelessly obsolete . So she tore the red bandana off of Labbie 's neck and renamed herself Lee Ann . <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Li'l Cricket . A week after she had arrived in Clemson , Katherine had gone to the Li'l Cricket to buy a loaf of wheat bread , which they did not have . She had to settle for Wonder Bread , which further enraged Katherine . She threw down the loaf on the counter and the clerk rang it up . Behind the clerk , there was a Xeroxed sign taped to the cigarette shelf that said : I can only help one person at a time , and let me tell you , today ai n't your day . ( And tomorrow ai n't looking too good , either . ) <p> " Ai n't that the truth , " Katherine said , trying to be accommodating . <p> " No , " the clerk said , " it ai n't . " <p> Katherine did n't know whether the clerk had gotten her point of reference or not , but it did n't matter . What did matter was that the clerk was a tobacco-stinking , bleached-out bulge of a woman who wore tootight denim shorts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't take any shit . The clerk 's ID tag said LEE ANN . Katherine immediately knew she had to jettison her God-given name . <p> " Lee Ann , " Katherine said , " I need to throw the baby out with the bath water . " <p> " Lady , you need a job or somethin ' , " the real Lee Ann said , giving Katherine her change and her white bread and then ignoring her entirely . <p> So Katherine did what the Li'l Cricket clerk suggested by word and by example : she got a job as a university fundraiser and she changed her name to Lee Ann . Lee Ann had hopes that announcing her name change would do something to her husband , produce some sort of shock or regret , but when she told him over dinner , " I 'm Lee Ann now , " he merely smiled and said , " I know , I 'm Teddy . " <p> It was true : just like that , he was Teddy . Whereas before , as Ted , he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran 10K races for the cure-all cures-and ironed his chinos and made variations of the same healthy stir-fry meal three times a week , now he was Teddy : a slovenly , bearded , sport-sandaled , thriving middle-aged lothario who drank too much and bet large sums on college football games and told roaringly funny stories about his pickled brain and what stupid things that brain told him to do . Overall Teddy was excellent company to everyone but his wife . Meanwhile , except for her job change , Lee Ann was much the same as Katherine , except older and much more permanently mired in regret and sorrow and loneliness . Lee Ann was the same as Katherine except there was more Lee Ann needed to forget . This was another reason she would go dancing . <p> The first house was the Merrills ' . Wayne and Ellen Merrill were both history professors , both recovering alcoholics as well , and they were known for throwing parties where no booze was served but guests were encouraged to bring their own instruments-acoustic guitars , inevitably , and the rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hootenanny . " At one of these parties , Lee Ann had been cornered by Wayne Merrill , who , armed with a twelve-string , had forced her to harmonize on a Glen Campbell song he insisted she knew though she did n't , and when the song-it was about the sorrows of drink-was over , Wayne had dropped his guitar and wept and asked Lee Ann if she knew how badly he wanted a drink right then . Lee Ann told him that she knew exactly what he was feeling and then fled the party and swore she would never go back , and remembering this , she considered skipping the Merrills ' house altogether in her quest to dance . But there were crashing sounds coming from the side yard , loud music that was recorded and electric , not live and acoustic . These were not the Merrills ' sounds , and Lee Ann remembered that the Merrills were away in Europe on sabbatical and that they had rented the house out to some students . Lee Ann heard voices that were , in turn , seductive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving her in an improvised two-step into the side yard . <p> The notable thing about the Merrills ' side yard that night was that it was lit up like a football stadium . There were two garage floodlights going and four cars with their headlights on arranged around the perimeter . In the center of all this light were two ping-pong tables ; on either end of the two ping-pong tables were two plastic cups of beer , and behind each cup-four to a table-was a man , or to be more precise , a boy . Each of the boys was wearing a golf visor and baggy shorts with many pockets and flip-flops and no shirt . They were playing a game , Lee Ann quickly understood , and the object of the game was to hit the ping-pong ball into the cup of beer . When this happened , the boy whose cup it was and his partner were obliged to chug their beer ; the boy who 'd sunk the ball and his partner were obliged , it seemed , to bump their fists or chests in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of the beer spilled on the boys ' chests and bellies during the chugging and even though some of the chests had hair on them and even though some of the bellies had already begun the outward bulge toward middle age , the effect of the light on the beer on the boys ' torsos was like hot soapy water on Greek statuary . <p> Just then , the song ended and a new one began and there was a great deal of whooping and suddenly Lee Ann was surrounded by the ping-pong players , who were dancing , and Lee Ann 's first thought was , Revenge . Because this , in a manner of speaking , was what Teddy had been doing to her for more than a decade now . There had been so many nights , at two in the morning , the hour when the bars closed , when Lee Ann lay in bed and imagined her husband desperately dancing through last call with his undergraduate lovers or his much younger sloppy bar manager , doing shots of tequila , admiring the happy wet sheen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She imagined Teddy going to lick off that sheen and the girl not stopping him . It was the loneliest feeling imaginable , like writing thank-you notes from the bottom of a volcano . Revenge , Lee Ann thought again . Someone gave her a shot of something and she drank it and started dancing with the boys . It was n't the kind of music she 'd had in mind-not big band , but rather the famously tragic southern rock group with the famous three-guitar attack-nor was it the kind of dancing she 'd wanted to do-it was not couples dancing , but rather dancing in a circle , not so much moving your feet as stomping them . But still , it was music , and there was sex in it and in the dancing , too : there was sex in the way she took her long , blondish hair out of its complicated twists and knots ; sex in the way she took off her light green sweater and tied it around her waist ; sex even in the boys ' air guitaring ; sex especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upside down , his chest hairless-who had quit his air guitar moved a little closer to her , as a dancing partner should . Lee Ann had no fear that this was a pity dance : she was twenty years older than the boy , it was true , but she was still very pretty , she knew this , and while she had lines on her face they gave the impression of health and sun and not overage , and while her clothes were mature they were not dated nor were they designed to cover up her body 's flaws , of which there were few . She and the boy circled around each other , dancing backward and then face to face , not touching , it was true , but to Lee Ann not touching was nearly as suggestive as touching would have been . <p> " Is your name Ryan ? " she shouted over the music . <p> " Yeah , " he shouted back . He did n't ask how she knew his name-she had a theory that every other male born between Atlanta and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did n't matter . What mattered was that Lee Ann had her Ryan and she was dancing with him and , for the first time in a long time , she felt good . <p> But then the song ended and the boys-her Ryan , too-went back to their ping-pong game , and Lee Ann was left standing by herself , watching them . Was this what it was like for Teddy , too ? Were twenty-year-old girls about adult sex one minute and adolescent drinking games the next ? Did Teddy wait around for them to change back ? She was pretty sure he did , and for a moment she even felt a little sorry for him . In the shadows of the party , Lee Ann could see a line of girls smoking cigarettes and glaring at her ; they would wait for the ping-pong game to exhaust itself . Lee Ann knew this because once she had been one of them . Perhaps Katherine would have still waited . But Lee Ann would not wait . She would not wait ! That she would not wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sense of perspective . There were other houses , other dance partners ; there might even be a rich suitor with a suitcase full of cash waiting for Lee Ann back at her house . The point was , there was no point in dancing your way through the sweet , spring night if you did not give yourself over to its expansive mystery and promise . The ping-pong ball grazed one of the cups but did not go in , and there was a great deal of arguing about the relevant Rules of the Game , and in the midst of this , Lee Ann sneaked out of the party and continued dancing down the street . <p> Had you seen Strawberry Lane that night from above , and had you had the ability to see through roofs and walls and enclosed patios , you might have mistaken Lee Ann for a meandering drunk , an attractive but troubled forty-four-year-old woman who had fallen off her medication . You would have seen her fox-trot into the Yerinas ' house without knocking . The four Yerinas-mother , father , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comedy about a rich family that had recently become a poor family . Both the Yerinas and their television counterparts seemed anesthetized , and Lee danced around them to the show 's theme song and exited the back door without saying good-bye . <p> There was no one home next door at the Hammonds ' , but the garage door was unlocked , and there was a minivan in the garage , and Lee Ann slithered over the hood , climbed and tap-danced on its roof as in a musical she 'd once seen , and then moved on to the next house , Mr. Cheever 's , where Lee Ann ripped the glass of gin out of the old widower 's shaky hands , set it sweating onto the end table , twirled Mr. Cheever a time or two the way Ginger never did with Fred , then placed the glass of gin back in his hands , sat Mr. Cheever on his couch as a fail safe against the drink , the twirling , and waltzed out of the house , pausing at the bathroom to jiggle the handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you were watching all this from above , and if you were a certain kind of deity , you would have right then descended to earth , stopped Lee Ann before she entered her next house , and demanded to know if she were feeling all right , if something truly bad had happened to her to cause such behavior . Have your parents died ? Has your husband left you ? Are you lost and far from your true home ? Are you stupid and blind with grief ? And while it was true that Lee Ann 's parents were dead ( for nearly a decade now ) , her husband no longer really a husband , her home not exactly her home , these things could not adequately explain her dancing . Does the mountain climber climb because he was beaten as a child ? Does the sailor sail because he pissed his bed well into elementary school ? " Let 's not psychologize , " Lee Ann would have said to the deity , " let 's dance , " making the deity whoosh up and away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to the Morriseys . <p> As was the case with the other houses , Lee Ann did not knock , but rather walked right in the front door . Thorn Morrisey was standing by himself in the living room , a cigarette over his right ear , a drink in his right hand , hair slicked back with either sweat or gel . He was dressed in a cream-colored summer suit , and his tie was loosened as if he 'd just returned from a nephew 's wedding or graduation . When he saw Lee Ann , he looked back over his shoulder toward the empty room and yelled , " Oh , good , the fundraiser is here ! " <p> " Will you please fix that fuse ! " a woman yelled from inside the house , and it was only then that Lee Ann noticed that the house was dark except for the light coming in off the street . Then , after a moment , the woman asked , " Who 's here ? " <p> " The fundraiser . " <p> " Which one ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then took the cigarette out from the crook of his ear , then began patting himself for a light . <p> Immediately , Lee Ann 's dancing felt diminished , demeaned , the way the mountain must be by the mountaineer 's athlete 's foot , the ocean by the sailor 's urinating over the bow . Apparently , even if you danced your way up and down your street , you could not forget that you were a fundraiser , that people expected you to ask for things they did not exactly want to give . And if you were from Connecticut , then you could not forget that you were a Yankee , even if South Carolina had become no less your home than Connecticut ever had , even if you tried to explain that people and places are not that different , and that white folks in Connecticut also hated black people and loved NASCAR . And if you were the wife of a wayward husband , your dancing could not help you forget that the world was choked full with cheating hearts-because Thom , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married to Bette , one of Lee Ann 's few friends , and Lee Ann knew that Bette was in Charleston , visiting her Alzheimered mother , and that the woman yelling from somewhere in the house was not Thom 's wife . <p> But still , Lee Ann could see no other choice but to dance . Besides , perhaps this was a necessary obstacle . True , she 'd always disliked Thom , who could be trusted to be somehow both dull and offensive , who inevitably would tell familiar racist jokes and then , when someone objected , hold up his hands in mock defensiveness and say , " What ? What ? " Perhaps this was a necessary sacrifice if she was to continue her journey up and down Strawberry Lane . Perhaps you had to dance with a sleazeball peckerwood before you could move on to better things . <p> " Let 's dance , " Lee Ann said . <p> Thorn stopped patting himself and smirked at Lee Ann . " I always thought there was something going on between us . " He held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be right back . " <p> " You do n't need a drink , " Lee Ann said . <p> " Do n't move , " Thom said . <p> The minute Thom was out of sight , Lee Ann moved , tiptoed first in the direction of the kitchen , where Thom was making his drink and humming , then off toward the right , toward where the woman 's voice had come from . The house was one of those deceptively large and meandering ranch houses , and so Lee Ann walked down a three-step flight of stairs , up another one , through a rec room , past two bathrooms , and into a sun room-a small , entirely glassed-in room furnished with a love seat and an end table . By the time Lee Ann arrived in that room , it felt as though she were in a different house altogether . But it was the same house , and there was the woman , sitting on the couch , knees tucked up to her chest . She was younger than Lee Ann , but not much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Bette , Thom 's wife . Her blonde hair had been overpermed or - bleached over the years and looked tired . Her blue eyes were red , as if she 'd been crying , but she was n't crying just then . She and Lee Ann looked at each other for a while , and then the woman said , " The power went out . I hate the dark . " When Lee Ann did n't respond , the woman said , " I do n't know what I 'm doing here , do you know what I mean ? " <p> " You 're fucking my friend 's husband , " Lee Ann said . <p> " I know , " the woman said . " Why am I here ? " <p> Lee Ann held out her arms to the woman , and the woman rose and took her arms as the submissive partner might , and they danced . It was a very controlled dance , because of the tight quarters , but it seemed important to Lee Ann that they not leave the tiny sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was the space they would use . It was the first time she 'd ever danced with another woman like this . It did not feel good or bad . It did not feel erotic , nor did it feel odd or repulsive . It felt like dancing with oneself , and once the dance was over , Lee Ann almost asked the woman if she 'd like to come with her as she finished her dance up and down Strawberry Lane . But then she heard Thom yelling from somewhere , deep or shallow , inside the house , " Where are you ? Hey ! " Lee Ann turned her head in the direction of the yelling and then turned back to the woman . She was back on the love seat , her knees tucked up into her chest again . Lee Ann would not wait for her bare-chested , visored , ping-ponging Ryan , but this woman would wait for Thom-that was what she was there for . So Lee Ann left her to wait . <p> A word on Lee Ann as a fundraiser : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying a thousand-dollar commemorative plaque in a second . Her fellow fundraisers would have been jealous of Lee Ann 's success if they were n't so completely cynical about their work . When talking to potential donors on the phone , Lee Ann 's colleagues made clownish , mocking gestures with their lips and their hands . When they actually did browbeat an alumnus or parent or corporation into making a pledge , they called the donors " suckers " and their donations " blood money . " She was n't like them , nor was she like her boss , an alumnus himself , a former second-string defensive lineman who liked to talk about his work in terms of client and contract . <p> " When you give money to the school , " he told his prospective clients and his new employees during orientation , " you are not simply handing over money to the school . Rather , you are signing a contract for success with the school itself . And as we all know , " and here Lee Ann 's boss looked at his clients and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the temptation to wink , " you can not honorably break a contract . " <p> The potential donors were inevitably lawyers , CPAs , industrial managers , and the like , and so on the whole were very skeptical about gifts ; but they were absolute devotees of contracts , and so this tactic rarely failed . But Lee Ann found it unnecessary hoo-ha . All she did was ask people for money ; if they said no , she asked someone else . Lee Ann gave the overall impression of not caring whether an alumnus gave money to his alma mater or not , which people , of course , found attractive , and they gave to such a degree that Lee Ann was the school 's top fundraiser , more proficient , even , than her boss , with his contracts and clients . <p> Which was why Lee Ann was so baffled by Barry , the video poker heir from Raleigh . It was n't that he 'd yet to give her and the university his money , was n't that he said No to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she found No definitive and comforting . But Barry would n't say No , nor Yes either . He said Maybe , had said it a dozen times over the past four years , had said it so many times it produced something like a feeling of longing in Lee Ann . A longing for what , exactly , she did not know , but she did know that longing was one of the things to be afraid of in this world . Longing was the enemy . It made you want something you did not really want as badly as the longing suggested you did , and which , if you got , would not make you happy . You could want but you could not be satisfied . Lee Ann had even tried to use her boss 's clients and contracts business on Barry , but after all he had been a studio arts major and had no idea what she was talking about . Which made her long for him , or his money , or both , even more . Perhaps this was why she had returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him now . Lee Ann was at the very arc of Strawberry Lane 's cul-de-sac ; she could have easily turned and watched her house , watched to see if Barry-he drove an Alfa Romeo , the only one , he insisted , in the entire state of South Carolina-had arrived yet . But she did n't , because this was what dancing was for . It could not make you forget the longing , but it could transform it . Lee Ann remembered watching her parents dance at her and Ted 's wedding ; they were good , dullish , ordinary people , but they were great dancers . When they were not dancing , Lee Ann forgot about them ; but when her parents were dancing , Lee Ann wanted to be them . This was what dancing could do . <p> And this was what it did do , because when Lee Ann reached the Howards ' house , the door opened without her even touching the knob . The Howard family-Terry , Alison , their son Ian-was standing there in the doorway , as if arranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he said , " We 've been watching you dancing . " <p> " What the hell . . . ? " Lee Ann began , and then , mysteriously , felt an overwhelming need for privacy . She hustled herself inside the house , then closed the door behind her . <p> " What the hell happened to you ? " Lee Ann asked . <p> Terry did n't say anything ; he just sat there in his wheelchair . His hands were in his lap ; he was wearing the kind of gloves worn only by golfers or baseball players or the wheelchair-bound . But Alison said , " You 've got to be kidding me . " <p> " Sure I am , " Lee Ann said , even though she was n't , even though she had no idea what had happened to Terry . This was clearly something she should have known : because it was a small town , because Terry lived on her short cul-de-saced street , because she should have known that something bad had happened to him . Even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own sorrow Lee Ann should be at least aware enough to know what put her neighbor in a wheelchair . After all , she saw him every day , at dusk , riding his bike up and down Clemson 's hilly streets , the hilly streets without any shoulders to speak of , the hilly , shoulderless streets on which the students drove too fast too drunk . But Lee Ann worked at the university ; she would have known if a student had put Terry in a wheelchair , because it might have been something she might have had to mention in reassuring potential donors that the school was n't allowing all of its students to get drunk and slaughter Clemson 's citizen population wholesale . So it was n't a student , but they were n't the only ones driving on Clemson 's hilly , shoulderless streets . There were also the retirees , the legions of retirees , and it was n't just that the streets were hilly and shoulderless but that they were without center lines , too , and so even if you were n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going a little blind and even if your reaction time were n't a little dulled by your eighty-odd-year history of reacting , then it would be difficult to tell exactly where you were on the road-whether you were too far over or not over far enough-until your right fender clipped the rear wheel of the bicyclist in front of you , sending him over the ditch and headfirst into a pine tree , shattering the helmet that was supposed to save not just his life , but also his spinal column , his fine-china-delicate vertebrae . <p> " I 'm so sorry , " Lee Ann said . <p> " Thank you , " Terry said . <p> " It happened six weeks ago , " Alison said . " So yeah , thanks . " <p> " Alison , " Terry said . " Quit it . " <p> " At least Teddy came by , " Alison said . " He bought a bottle of good gin . " <p> And there it was , on the dining room table ; Lee Ann could see it . It had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than what Teddy himself drank . And apparently Teddy was a good , generous person , better than Lee Ann herself was . Ian , Alison and Terry 's son , still had n't said anything . He was looking away from Lee Ann , toward the wall , and she followed his eyes and saw that there were a dozen holes in the plaster , fist holes , and they were both at wheelchair height and higher . Her eyes went back to Ian , whose own eyes were hollow and pitted and looked much like the fist holes he was still staring at . He was a teenager , she saw , a normal teenager except sadder , which is to say he was the saddest person she had ever seen . <p> " I 'm not supposed to drink , " Terry said . " But would you like some gin ? " <p> Lee Ann did n't say anything . She did n't move . She had forgotten all about dancing ; she could n't remember how she 'd gotten to the Howards ' house , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Outside the house there might have been longing and its opposite , but inside there was only shame and fear , which you might be able to dance away if only they did n't stop you from dancing in the first place . <p> " Anyway , " Alison said , " we were watching you dancing . . . " <p> " It was very beautiful , " Terry said . " Very impressive . " <p> " And we were wondering . . . " Alison said . <p> They were wondering if she would dance with one of them . And she had to : her husband had brought them gin-weeks ago , probably-and she owed them at least a dance . But with whom ? She would n't dance with Terry : she had seen people dance with the wheelchaired , at weddings , at parties , and the dancing reeked so much of pity that it could n't be called dancing , the people doing it could n't even be called people . And she would n't dance with Alison-because Alison hated her , hated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own son , and because what they 'd be doing would not be dancing but would instead be something closer to war . <p> " Come here , you , " Lee Ann said to Ian . <p> He came to her , even though he would not look at her . Terry wheeled over to the stereo , pressed a button or two , and music came out of the speakers . It was one of those popular Duke Ellington songs that people who do n't listen to music listen to when they want to listen to music . Lee Ann and Ian danced to it anyway . They danced as befitted their circumstances : stiffly , awkwardly , as though their legs were in polio braces , as though they were both teenagers and not just one of them . Lee Ann could dance better than this , of course-there was the time when Ted and she danced at their wedding on the heels of a dozen lessons devoted specially to that one dance , and their two-step had wowed their guests , if not themselves-and she was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed to her the most genuine thing she had ever done . It was the most surprising moment of her life : she was capable of doing something genuine again ; or maybe it was the first time she had ever done something genuine . And just as she was trying to remember if she 'd ever done any thing genuine before this moment , Ian moved his hand from her back up to the back of her head , which he cupped gently for the remainder of the song-the song that began with her doing something for him , and ended with him doing something for her . <p> " We 'll all be fine , " Ian whispered in her ear . " Please do n't cry . " But she did n't know what he was talking about ; she was n't crying , she was certain of it , even though her eyes were blurry and her voice shook and cracked as she said , " Good night , take care , I 'll see you soon , " and then backed out the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could smell the smoke , feel the fingers of heat . Lee Ann was glad that something was on fire ; it distracted her from the Howards . Something was on fire ! Perhaps it was her house ; perhaps it was her ! It was n't the Charneys ' house or the Lius ' , she saw as she danced past them , the smell and the heat getting stronger as she got toward the Parks ' house . She could actually see the flames now , their own shadowy dance with the magnolia and white pines . The Parks ' house was on fire ! It was a happy prospect-not because she did n't like the Parks , but because theirs was the last house before hers and it seemed a suitably big note on which to end her dancing : one final , pagan dance around the fire before going home to her guests , her clients , her Barry , and all their past , present , and future contracts . <p> But the Parks ' house was n't on fire at all . Lee Ann saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was coming from somewhere off to the right and behind the house . She followed the flames until , in the middle of the Parks ' backyard , she came to a bonfire . In the center of the bonfire , Lee Ann could see the white-hot skeletal remains of wooden pallets , a recliner , a dresser even . There were a dozen or so people sitting around the fire on a variety of wooden chairs , and Lee Ann suspected that those chairs would also be in the fire before too long . The people around the fire were completely quiet , as if ruminating on the fate of their seats . <p> " What is that smell ? " someone asked . Lee Ann could n't see his face , could n't see anyone 's face . <p> " Fish , " someone said . " Who threw a fucking fish in the fire ? " <p> It was n't a fish ; it was Lee Ann 's nameless dog ; Lee Ann could see it sprinting around the perimeter of the firelight , could smell it orbiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lee Ann said . " It 's a dog . " <p> " Who is that ? " <p> " It 's Katherine , " Lee Ann said , because the fire , her dog , her dancing , the night had suddenly made her extraordinarily tired-tired of being Lee Ann , tired of owning a dog she did n't really own and whose name and gender she did n't even know . <p> " Hello , Katherine , " another voice said . " It 's Ted . " <p> Lee Ann walked over to the voice . It was her husband , all right . He was wearing a Hawaiian shirt open to midchest ; Lee Ann could see the swell of his belly , on which rested his hands , one of which cupped a cigarette ; his beard was enormous and red in the firelight . Even his head looked huge ; there was a long-billed fishing cap perched on the very peak of his skull , and it was clearly pushed down as far as it could go ; there were angry waves of hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last time she 'd seen him , but since whenever that was , it looked as though her husband had swallowed his former self . <p> " I 'm so tired , " Lee Ann said . " Can I have your seat ? " <p> " Do I have to move first ? " <p> " No , " Lee Ann said , and plopped down on his lap . She did this so suddenly that Teddy jerked his cigarette away and dropped it to the grass ; Lee Ann could see it glowing down by her feet , next to a beer can that Teddy picked up and took a pull from . There was no difference between how the beer smelled and how Teddy smelled . Lee Ann wiggled around until she was properly settled . It felt as though she was sitting on an inner tube that had not yet lost its middle . <p> " Well , " Teddy said . <p> " I was just at the Howards ' , " Lee Ann said . " Just horrible . " <p> " I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle of gin . " <p> " That was nice of you . " <p> " It was actually your gin , " Teddy said . " I took it from the liquor cabinet sometime back . " <p> " Oh , " Lee Ann said . <p> " You do n't like gin , " Teddy said . " Not really . " <p> " That 's true . " <p> Someone on the other side of the fire stood up , threw the chair on which he 'd been sitting into the fire , then threw a beer can in the direction of the dog , whose fish stink was still whizzing around the fire . <p> " What 's going on here ? " Lee Ann asked . <p> " Roger and Lucy are getting a divorce , " Teddy said . <p> " So you 're burning their furniture ? " <p> " It seemed like a good idea at the time . " <p> " Was it Roger 's idea or Lucy 's ? " <p> " Possibly neither , " Teddy said , and waved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely dark . Lee Ann had been there many times-for dinner parties , to watch the World Series , to celebrate this or that . But at that moment it was hard to believe that anyone had ever lived there . <p> " What were you doing at the Howards ' ? " Teddy asked . <p> " Dancing , " Lee Ann said . <p> " I do n't want a divorce , " Teddy said suddenly . <p> Lee Ann nodded . " Me neither . " <p> " Why not ? " <p> " I 've never liked you better , " Lee Ann said . It was the truth . She had lied to herself for years about how Teddy had wrecked her life ; she had longed for the time when she was Katherine and he Ted . But the truth was that she had n't ever really liked Ted-he was officious , he was dull , but he was good , so it was difficult actually to justify or understand her dislike for him . But Teddy was easy to dislike ; it was understandable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in turn , like him . Love no longer applied , if it ever had ; sex was irrelevant , too ( there was no stirring in her sitting in Teddy 's lap , even though she could feel a stirring in him ) . But she liked him now , she could n't deny it , and could n't imagine her life without him , either : could n't imagine him not not coming home for months at a time even though he was never more than a few miles from home , could n't imagine him not running around on her with girls half his age , making a happy , debauched spectacle of himself all over town . If he kept on the way he was going-which he would-then Teddy would almost certainly die before she did , and this made her sad . Losing Teddy would be like losing one of the poles , North or South . The thought made her sad , and it made her even sadder to see him here , nearly despondent , watching the flames of someone else 's marriage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did so well . <p> " There 's a big party down at the Merrills , " Lee Ann said . " They 're playing beer ping-pong . " <p> " Beer pong ? " <p> " Right , " Lee Ann said . " Plus , girls . " <p> " OK , " he said . " I love you . But do you mind if I get up ? " <p> She did n't ; they both stood up . He kissed her lightly on the cheek , and without another word he left the bonfire . The other men got up and followed along , as did the dog , its smell trailing behind him . Lee Ann was alone again . She had heard other women-women who had never married , divorced women , widows-say that they liked being alone . Lee Ann did n't believe this for a second . They were lying , she was certain of it , and this was another thing to guard against : not loneliness , which was inevitable , but lying about it . A car door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not the door of a truck , but of a sports car . It was probably Barry . Perhaps he would give his gift to her tonight ; perhaps not . Perhaps he would give her more than his gift . Perhaps whatever he gave her would make her less lonely for a little while , but the loneliness would come back , it had to , there was no sense lying about it , and there was no sense in longing for a time when she was n't lonely . And while she was at it , there was no sense in lying about the dancing , either . It did not make her less lonely , less likely to long . It was simply a way of getting from one place to another , and now she needed to get back home , to her party , where people were waiting for her . <p>
