<p> Utterly useless skills . Bailing out an outrigger canoe . Teetering on a hunk of waxed fiberglass . Clinging to a parasail 300-feet above the waters off Hawaii . Chasing a pod of spinner dolphins . My daughter and I are back from Oahu with a new set of resort skills that have little or no use in the real world . And I would n't have it any other way . A few days into our stay at Waikiki , I realized that my 14-year-old daughter 's choice of activities seemed to eschew anything that might have any educational value or relevance to our day-to-day life . And why not ? For most teens , vacations are n't about building a resume . They 're about adventure , exploring limits , and bragging rights back at school . With that realization , I relinquished my control of the schedule and activity selection . Both of us will get a break from our traditional roles : Dad setting the rules and guiding choices ; daughter naturally testing the limits of her independence . I stopped trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the island history , check out the ranches , and explore the sawtooth volcanic ranges on horseback or foot . Instead , I let her go . The result : a tension-free , water-sport vacation - and a better relationship . <p> Dolphin chasers We motored out of Koko Marina , about a half-hour east of Waikiki , towing behind us three " Wild Things . " Captain Troy , a surfer from California who came here about 10 years ago , <p> was taking six of us out to explore a reef . We would each have our own two-person , motorized glass-bottom skiff or " Wild Thing . " We jumped in , and my daughter grabbed the throttle-grip of the Honda outboard . " Flip that little lever from neutral to forward , " said Troy , checking her out . " Twist the grip to go . Hold the kill switch in your other hand . Push the handle in the opposite direction to where you want to go . Got it ? " Jasmine nodded eagerly . I watched dubiously . We set off zigzagging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reef and started to toss food out to attract the fish . But suddenly our boat swerved and our reef adventure took a detour . " Dolphins ! " Jasmine screamed . And we were off in pursuit , bouncing across the waves as Dad clung to the sides like a hobo holding his last dollar . A pod of 15 to 20 spinner dolphins were racing us just below the surface as we careened along . On both sides and in front they were pacing us . Occasionally a pair would arc together out of the water or a single dolphin would showboat by dancing on his tail . " Look Daddy ! They 're under us ! " Peering through the plexiglass bottom , I could see half-a-dozen blue-gray dolphins running a few feet beneath us . " Mom , we 're dolphin chasers ! " shouted 13-year-old Alexandra in a little runabout bouncing nearby . The dolphins could have outrun us , or veered away . But they stayed and for about 15 minutes we frolicked and played tag with them . Later , Troy told us that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safer waters between Hawaii Kai and Diamond Head . " At night , they go hunting , joining larger pods that can number in the thousands . By day , they half-sleep here , " he says . " You do n't see this every day . " " Could we swim with them ? " asked Jasmine . " No , " Troy said firmly . " They know the sound of every boat in this marina , but they 're not used to people in the water . They 'd scatter . " " You were fortunate . We only see dolphins about 1 in 10 trips here . " <p> Practical info : Wild Thing glass-bottom boats at Reef Adventure , Koko Marina Center , ( 808 ) 395-6133 .

There are several places on the beach at Waikiki that will rent you a board and give you a quick lesson . Based on our experience , we would suggest that you start with Hans Hedemann and his crew of professional curl riders who operate out of a cramped shop at the Diamond Head Beach Hotel . Several parents and five teen girls gather on the beach outside , skirting a Japanese wedding photo session on the hotel lawn . " OK , girls , listen up . Parents , too . " A 10-minute beach lesson by blonde and bronzed Bob gives us the rudiments of hanging 10 . It 's not as complicated as I thought it would be . If you can find the center of the board , do a push up , and fall off with out jumping in feet first on the sharp coral , you 've got the basics . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an emergency there are four exits on this craft : to the front , back , right and left , " says Bob with a grin . With that , we 're each told to grab a board . " Ah , Bob , what about him ? " says another instructor , Charlie , pointing at me . Bob rubs his chin , frowning . " You better give him the 12-footer . " Oh , yeah . Give the Big Bertha board to the dad with the expanding waistline . Charlie hands me a flowered board that looks more like a local shirt than a wave rider . And it 's only slightly smaller than the USS Enterprise . We paddle out into the surf , with some trepidation . There 's one instructor for every two or three students . Hedemann 's surf school is a bit pricer than some in Waikiki . But the student-instructor ratio is better . Ask John Elway , former quarterback of the Denver Broncos . Or actress Carrie Fisher ( Remember Princess Lea in Star Wars ? ) . They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And most of the instructors are current or former surf professionals , like Hedemann . As we paddle out toward the docile three-foot waves , I 'm skeptical . Is 10 minutes of instruction going to be enough ? As a swell approaches , Charlie tells me to start paddling furiously and gives my board a shove from behind . " Stand up ! " he yells . With my hands at my waist , I push up from the board and shove one foot forward . The wave slides past and I coast to a stop , still standing . OK , so it was n't a photo op . At least my dignity is not ground into the reef . Within minutes , everyone in the group , parents and teens , have all ridden their first wave with varying degrees of success . It 's remarkably easy . Of course , we 're just getting started . Charlie suggests we try controlling the speed . " Walk forward a bit to speed up the board . Step back to slow down . " While waiting for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath from paddling out , I ask Charlie about how he got started . " My mom ! " he enthuses . " Your mom was a beach bum ? " " Finest kind ! " Charlie grew up in Florida where his mom taught him and his brothers and sisters how to ride . He still surfs professionally . That 's why he 's here . " Summers are real busy with lessons , " he says . " But it slows down in the winter , and that 's when we go to the North Shore to surf the big waves . " We 're out in the water for at least an hour . Everyone 's exhilarated - and exhausted . " The Denver Broncos did n't last as long as you did , " says Charlie . " They 're big , but their muscles are in the wrong places for surfing , " he laughs . We smile reassured . We 've all got the bug . This is one resort skill we ca n't wait to hone again .
