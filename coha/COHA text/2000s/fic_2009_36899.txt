From : Connie Lawson To : SAHM I Am <p> Subject : SAHM I AM Welcome back , Rosalyn ( and an Important Announcement ) <p> Beloved Moms , <p> I am SO pleased to have the honor of welcoming back our dear Rosalyn Ebberly to our SAHM I Am loop . As many of you know , Rosalyn made the wise decision about a year ago to take some time away from our loop family so that she could focus on some intensive therapy and counseling with her own family Praise God , He blessed them with much healing . Today , they are stronger and healthier than ever . And Rosalyn feels at peace with returning to the loop . <p> She will return to her moderator duties immediately , and none too soon . The other half of my news is n't nearly as wonderful . My mom , who is in her seventies and lives all by herself in Santa Fe , is going in for double hip replacement surgery next week . We 've been discussing it for several months , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surgery and through the rehabilitation period . This is going to be a HUGE upheaval in my family 's routine , since James ( who 's thirteen now ! ) is going to have to either move in with little brothers John and Josiah or let them move in with him . Rachel and Rebecca were already sharing , and we did n't have a guest room . <p> And Mom is going to need so much help with everything for a long time . So just as Rosalyn is returning , I 'm afraid I 'm going to have to say goodbye for a while . I 'll miss you all terribly , but I know I 'm leaving the loop in the best hands possible . Rosalyn will take care of everything . Please give her the same cooperation and respect you 've always given me . If you want to e-mail me privately , you can . May Jesus bless all of you . With all the mother-love in my heart , Your loop mom , Connie Lawson SAHM I Am Loop Mom <p> From : Rosalyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I AM <p> TOTW June 1 : Total Honesty <p> Sweetest Sisters , <p> It is SUCH a joy to be back among you ! I feel like I 've been sojourning in a strange land and have finally returned home . It 's been a bit more than a year since I took my sabbatical , and yet you girls have made me feel like I never left . <p> This past seventeen months has been a time of growth and healing for me and my family I 'm looking forward to sharing what I 've learned with all of you . I think the best way to do that will be through my resumed duty of moderating the Topic of the Week . My sister , Veronica , has , from what I 've heard , been doing a great job in my absence , but when she heard how eager I was to take my old place again as TOTW facilitator , she graciously agreed to step aside . <p> Most of you know I 've been involved in intensive therapy and counseling along with my family . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I must be COMPLETELY HONEST with those around me . So this is our TOTW  --  Total Honesty . <p> It 's difficult to be honest and vulnerable with other people , even the ones we love . But I 've learned that this is the ONLY way to truly break the cycle of dysfunction and strife . <p> So let 's practice this week , shall we ? I 'd like each of you to share with us one deeply personal thing that you 've never shared before . As we bare our hearts to each other , grace and friendship will be released , and we 'll be closer than ever . With that in mind , here is my confession . I give it to you with trembling fingers and a full heart : <p> I HATE to cook . In fact , sometimes when it 's been a really bad day , I call my husband and ask him to stop at McDonald 's on the way home from work . I can down a Big Mac in under two minutes , and we have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basement when company comes over . <p> Whew ! It 's great to have that out in the open at last ! See , honesty is n't so hard . What about you ? Get that secret off your chest . And remember , this is for posterity , sobe honest . Peace to you all , Rosalyn Ebberly SAHM I Am Loop Moderator <p> " The " wise woman builds her house , but the foolish tears it down with her own hands . " Proverbs 14:1 ( NASB ) <p> From : Zelia Muzuwa To : " Green Eggs and Ham " <p> Subject : She hates to cook ? ? ? ? <p> THAT 'S her big confession ? After all the pomposity , after all the " I 'm so much better than you , you poor things , why ca n't you be more like me ah , but you ca n't and never will , you LOSERS " after waging a war on Christmas because retailers were n't saying the greeting SHE thought was most correct after being so paranoid about her husband that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were freaking out and drawing pictures of themselves in COFFINS <p> She expects us to be impressed that she 's confessed to a lack of interest in the culinary arts ? ? ? <p> Air . I need air . I 'm hyperventilating . Her first day back , and I 'm already developing a nervous tic . At this rate , we 'll ALL need intensive therapy . Z <p> From : Dulcie Huckleberry <p> To : " Green Eggs and Ham " <p> Subject : Re : She hates to cook ? ? ? ? <p> How do you really feel , Ham ? Honestly . Share it on the loop , dear one . You know it 's for posterity . The emotional health of your children hangs in the balance . Dulcie <p> From : Zelia Muzuwa To : " Green Eggs and Ham " <p> Subject : Re : She hates to cook ? ? ? ? <p> Do n't tempt me . Z <p> From : P. Lorimer To : " Green Eggs and Ham " <p> Subject : Re : She hates to cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if you may have some unforgiveness toward her . Are you certain you do n't need to confess it on the loop ? It will do you much good . <p> Teasing , <p> Phyllis <p> From : Zelia Muzuwa To : " Green Eggs and Ham " <p> Subject : Re : She hates to cook ? ? ? ? <p> Phyllis , darling , do n't you have a graduate class to study for ? Something along the lines of " Dripping Faucets : A Survey of the Most Irritating Women of Western Civilization " ? You could write a paper on our loop moderator . <p> Besides , the TOTW was about honesty , not forgiveness . I 've never struggled with being honest . Z <p> From : Dulcie Huckleberry <p> To : " Green Eggs and Ham " <p> Subject : Re : She hates to cook ? ? ? ? <p> Betcha five bucks that forgiveness is next week 's topic . Dulcie <p> From : P. Lorimer To : " Green Eggs and Ham " <p> Subject : Re : She hates to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll see your five and raise you one . <p> Phyllis <p> From : Zelia Muzuwa To : " Green Eggs and Ham " <p> Subject : Re : She hates to cook ? ? ? ? <p> Aaaarrrgghhh ! ! ! You 're a PASTOR 'S WIFE ! You do n't make bets ! And besides , you did it wrong . If you think Dulcie 's bet is right , why would you raise it ? Oh , never mind I have to go pick up my children from school . Why they have to schedule school all the way into June boggles the mind . Z <p> From : P. Lorimer To : Dulcie Huckleberry <p> Subject : Zelia ? <p> Oops . Do you think I made her angry ? I was only trying to joke around with her . All of you know I think betting is stupid . I was truly just kidding . Phyllis <p> From : Dulcie Huckleberry <p> To : P. Lorimer <p> Subject : Re : Zelia ? <p> LOL ! I think you 're okay , Phyllis . You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year . But Z 's been a bit stressed out lately . No wonder  --  things have n't been going too well with Lishan and Duri . I think she 's really worried about them . It 's been eighteen months since they brought those two home from Ethiopia , and they 're still having a lot of language problems . She told me Duri has been wetting the bed almost every night , and Lishan has terrible nightmares . I feel bad for her  --  wish there was something I could do to help .

I read through the archives and found out what happened to u  --  thinking your husband was having an affair and then the woman turned out to be a Lesbian ! And all the problems with your kids ! That 's so humiliating ! You 're really brave to come back to a big loop like this where everyone knows all that bad stuff about you . <p> I 'm just trying to say do n't feel bad about not liking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's no big deal .
