Two things stand out on your first trip to western North Dakota , just as they did for Lewis and Clark 200 years ago : First , the savage , rugged beauty of the Badlands ; second , the appalling lack of cell service . ( While building Fort Mandan , Lewis is said to have heaved his BlackBerry into Lake Sakakawea . ) This Old West throwback is where Theodore Roosevelt hunted buffalo before becoming the 26th president of the United States . He is celebrated in the town of Medora , just as explorers Lewis and Clark , who camped in the state for 146 nights , are immortalized at the Lewis &; Clark Interpretive Center in Washburn . " NoDak " is also home to some pretty fantastic ( and wildly cheap ) golf . Whether you 're on the 21-course Lewis &; Clark Golf Trail ( **26;1659;TOOLONG ) or cherry-picking its best three tracks on the roughly 500-mile Triple Challenge , from Bismarck to Medora to Williston , as detailed here , you 'll be doing plenty of driving , so splurge for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bismarck airport ( direct flights from Denver , Minneapolis and Las Vegas ) . A few more tips : Budget at least four days for this Old West adventure . Do n't tell your cardiologist about the pitchfork steak fondue dinner . And lay off the Fargo jokes  --  that 's eastern North Dakota . WHERE TO PLAY Hawktree Golf Club , Bismarck - A mere 15 minutes from the airport  --  that Starbucks just south of Interstate 94 will be the last you 'll see for a while  --  Hawktree is a bucolic track with few trees and wide-open vistas . As at Montana 's acclaimed Old Works Golf Course , the bunkers are filled with black coal slag . You 'll see a few historical tokens along the way , giving architect Jim Engh 's 7,085-yard , topsy-turvy design a distinct sense of place . A broken-down wagon has been left to rot in the long grass to the right of the second green , and a pair of tall rusted windmills stand guard over the fourth and 14th holes . Myrtle Beach it 's not . The downhill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3s you 'll ever see without water , with a small , recessed sliver of green framed by thick rough . Hawktree is eminently playable , and you can even make a good score , with a caveat : You 'll want to move up a set of tees the first time . Unless you 've played the course or have a very helpful playing partner , you wo n't know where to aim from the back tees . Best bet : Schedule enough time to play it twice . Bully Pulpit Golf Course , Medora - West of Hawktree on I-94 ( take Exit 27 ) . Drive time : Two hours . When architect Michael Hurdzan heard about Bully Pulpit , he " had no interest in going someplace you ca n't get to . " When he got there and saw the towering buttes , jaw-dropping chasms and bright-orange " burning " rock , he cut his fee to make sure he got the job . The resulting course made our list of the Top 10 You Can Play in 2004 . The back nine gives Bully its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock  --  a gateway to the Badlands  --  backdrops the green of the par-4 11th hole . Before long , you 're playing through surreal spires and majestic buttes . The 404-yard , par-4 14th hole calls for a drive over a gaping maw of rock and native vegetation to a thin fairway  --  the hardest shot at Bully . The ascent to the 15th tee , on a very exposed ledge , is one of the prettiest cart rides anywhere , with sweeping vistas over your left shoulder . This 161-yard par-3 hole spans a wide chasm to a shallow green  --  good luck holding it with a tailwind . A huge , boulder is perched improbably above the tee of the severely downhill , 451-yard 16th , dubbed Perched Rock . The dogleg-left , 503-yard , par-5 17th will tempt players to go for the tucked green in two , but few will get there . By the time you finish playing these four stunning holes , you 'll be pining to play them again . The Links of North Dakota at Red Mike Resort , Williston - East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on 1804 . Drive time : 3 hours . Yes , it 's a very long drive to Red Mike , named for a notorious 19th century horse thief who was buried there , but then it 's a long trip to Scotland , too . From the gnarly , Pro V1-filled rough to the views of Lake Sakakawea , Red Mike is a pure links experience  --  inland style . One of the tenets of the owners is that perfection is not when there is nothing left to add but nothing left to take away . So they 86 'd the teebox signs marking each hole . But you wo n't get lost , especially if you pick up the excellent yardage book in the shop . You 'll feel a sense of pride and wonder here  --  pride that you put in the drive-time necessary to find the place , and wonder that such a track exists in central nowhere . Gary Christian , an Englishman and mini-tour player who shot a course-record 61 in the wind , calls Red Mike " the best links I 've ever played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea . The ball actually reacts like links shots should . " Red Mike 's architect , Stephen Kay , moved very little earth on the bluffs overlooking the lake . There is no water to hit into , just native grasses and 82 bunkers . The par 3s are memorable , especially the downhill 17th , which is 232 yards long from the back tees and calls for a right-to-left drive or a 3-wood into the wind . SECOND-TIER TRACKS It 's a big state  --  break up the driving with a quick 18 on one of these lesser-known courses : Riverwood Golf Club is long ( 7,004 ) and tight  --  the fairways are lined with Cottonwood trees  --  but it 's a great value at $20 . Same goes for Prairie West Golf Course in nearby Mandan , which is a pleasant , scenic stroll . Heart River Municipal Golf Course in Dickinson is a tale of two nines . The front nine is flat , the back is clogged with hazards . A half-hour outside Minot , Souris Valley Golf Club features fairly open fairways and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wee Links nine-holer is for kids 12 and under and costs only $1 , $5 for an adult accompanied by a child . Painted Woods Golf Course is a cute little nine-holer just off Highway 83 , 35 miles north of Bismarck in Washburn  --  home of the Lewis &; Clark Interpretive Center . Painted Woods Creek meanders through the well-maintained course .
