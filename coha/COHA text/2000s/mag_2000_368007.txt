Among tiny Malaysia 's legions of civil servants , few are as implacable as Pahamin Rajab , 54 , point man in the struggle against digital counterfeiting . Decked out in his trademark bow tie and cowboy hat , the secretary-general of Malaysia 's Trade and Consumer-Affairs Ministry recently led 100 security agents on a morning raid through a downtown shopping mall , seizing illegal music , video and computer-software CDs . At one retail booth , a television monitor was advertising bootlegged wares . " Take the TV , " he ordered , pointing with his gold-tipped walking stick . " We will be back day after day until they shut down forever . " <P> Tough talk , but Pahamin has a long way to go . As Malaysia 's top trademark watchdog since 1998 , he has seen the country become one of Asia 's biggest centers of piracy for all kinds of digital wares . Just three days after last year 's blockbuster Star Wars : Episode 1  --  The Phantom Menace opened in U.S. theaters , pirated versions were on sale in Malaysia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spotted as far away as southern Africa , Europe and South America . <P> Optical recording  --  both legal and illegal  --  is a big business in Malaysia , but poorly paid local law enforcers never made the war against counterfeiting much of a priority until the government realized that a bad reputation for protecting intellectual property would sink hopes of attracting critical investment . Piracy cuts into the profits of the big , predominately U.S. companies that produce so much of the global-entertainment menus . But Malaysia 's legitimate CD producers feel the squeeze too . The government has encouraged legitimate digital production ( which has expanded from one optical-disc plant in 1996 to around 50 today ) as part of the country 's effort to move up the technology ladder . Malaysian factories churn out an estimated 315 million CDs a year , worth $300 million . But producers who respect intellectual property rights complain that they ca n't compete with those who do n't . <P> Piracy is also crippling the local film and music industries . Employment at music-production studios has dropped a third since 1996 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights are protected . Malaysian filmmakers released seven movies last year , compared with 18 in 1995 , and box-office receipts are down 49% over the past two years . CD pirates " are like leeches , sucking the life out of the film industry , " reports the Video and Film Industry Association of Malaysia . <P> Pahamin has 500 agents at his disposal to beat back the leeches , but the agents have a lot of different jobs to do . ( Among other things , they spend time monitoring the price of chickens and other domestic staples . ) In general , Pahamin 's strategy is to try to shut down the counterfeiters and their retail outlets , rather than go after consumers . But the outlaws are outwitting the sheriff . One night last September , Pahamin and 100 officers descended on a warehouse in Johor Bahru , some 200 miles southeast of Kuala Lumpur , a transit point that had been under surveillance for months . The building was empty , its occupants apparently warned of the raid . " As sophisticated as we are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "
