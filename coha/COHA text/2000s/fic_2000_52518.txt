Super Thrifty . Some said she 'd been at the Lucky Mart , while others said she 'd been eating fried clams with her friends at McManahan 's Fish Fry . Of course the people of Apple Island , Massachusetts , had known about Rosa Dean 's beauty for years . They 'd watched her blossom from a knobby-kneed , bucktoothed prepubescent into a rare beauty . Over the years her teeth straightened with the help of braces , and her cheekbones became more pronounced . The sun ( or chemicals  --  it was open to debate ) bleached her mud-colored hair , and her gray eyes began to look silver to those who saw them in a certain light . Her abnormal height , six-one in the eighth grade  --  Goliath , the kids used to call her  --  when aligned with her other increasingly attractive traits began to lend her the stature of a superhero , and most islanders felt proud when they first saw her face on the cover of a fashion magazine , a year after she 'd left the island , the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rosa was made even more miraculous by the fact that she came from a family of snaggle  --  toothed lobstermen and hearty , hairy lobsterwomen , many of whom were often mistaken for men by tourists . Even Norton and Harriet Dean admitted that their daughter seemed to have sprung from an alternate gene pool . <p> Rosa 's foremost fan was Gil Pincus , president of the Apple Island High School French club , chess club , and committee to limit tourism on the island . Throughout his high school years everyone knew what Gil felt for Rosa ; he was n't exactly private about his yearnings . He 'd spray-painted her name on the outside of the school gymnasium . He 'd taken out a full-page ad in The Apple Island Times that read , " Marry Me Rosa Dean . I 'll Make You A Blissful Woman . " <p> Though he was kinder than the god whom he thanked nightly for creating Rosa , Gil did n't have a friend younger than thirty years old on the island . At only nineteen , he was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't say much about Gil . His audacity and appearance kept them at bay ; the boy had a hearing aid and stood five foot two . One of his eyes remained wet and gray like a clam . He did n't take well to showers , as he had sensitive skin that erupted in rashes whenever it came in contact with water that was too warm or too cold or contained the smallest level of chlorine . So his hair tended to look slick and lifeless like an otter 's hide on his small head . It was no secret he did n't have a chance of capturing the heart of the most sought-after beauty on the island . <p> The local chapter of Alcoholics Anonymous met every other Tuesday in the Baptist church on Grove Street . Gil Pincus 's aunt , Maureen Brunelli , regularly attended meetings . But on this particular Tuesday , the seventh of 1999 , Maureen , for the first time in three years , did not come to the meeting . Gil had wound up in the hospital two days ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burns lining his neck . The doctor said his mother had found him one minute before it was too late . <p> Maureen had n't been answering the members ' calls these past couple days ; she 'd been holed up at her sister 's house , shuttling her back and forth from the hospital . If only Maureen had come , she could have told the members his condition . Word had it he 'd snapped out of his coma , and the members could n't help but wonder what the boy 's first words had been , what thoughts had popped into his head as his body pushed back open the door his heart had tried to close . <p> Gil had just returned from visiting Rosa in California . No one knew what had happened on that trip , and the members could n't stop trying to pinpoint what would push this boy to such an act . They considered the past ; when Rosa still lived on Apple , Gil had trailed after Rosa and her friends like a shadow wherever they went  --  the stores , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a polite five feet behind them  --  and while she certainly did n't invite him to join them , she did n't send him away , either . People watched him watch her . They saw her smile sheepishly , looking back to make sure he was still there , following her down the street or to her classes . She seemed to recognize his presence as a given in her life . But her friends wondered why she never just told him to give up once and for all . " I do n't know , " she said to them . " That just would n't be nice , right ? " <p> No one would have said Rosa Dean was especially intelligent . She was quiet as a mouse most of the time , and she was n't one to let particularly humorous things fly from her mouth . But Rosa had a purity , a decent , honest purity that some theorized came from her limited intelligence and , combined with her looks , drew men like flies . <p> Russell Barton yanked his chair to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started . " He pressed his large hands against his lap and leaned into the group . " Maureen ca n't come , it 's not the end of the world . " <p> " Hold on , Russ , " said Maryanne Kaminski . " It is n't like her to not show . She 'd have called at least . " <p> Maureen Brunelli was the town librarian , a woman defined by her promptness and organizational skills , her extraordinary predictability , save a fading addiction to alcohol that had landed her in the hospital several times . <p> " Maybe she 's come down with a flu or something , " Russell said . He saw the others eyeing him . " Okay , all right . After the meeting , I 'll run over to her place and check on her . " <p> " I 'll come , " Ed Sanders said , and Celia McDougall nodded her head and mumbled , " Me , too . " <p> Silence burst into the room . Gil 's presence was strong and oppressive ; it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down a wrinkle on his pants . A plane flew past overhead , buzzing like a fly in the room . <p> " I 'll start , " said Maryanne , inevitably the first to get things going lately . She 'd recently divorced her philandering husband , Munro . " I had a difficult week , it being Valentine 's Day and all . I even bought a bottle of Scotch . I keep picturing that bastard with all his goddamned women  --  all my goddamned friends . I suppose I need a new word for them now . " <p> Maryanne Kaminski referred to everyone she knew as her friend . She spewed her problems on every waitress , clerk , and fisherman in town ; she expected the world from everyone she came in contact with . That , the members speculated , had been part of the problem in her marriage . What must she have expected from Munro ? Sure , he was a bastard for philandering . But never was a story so simple , they knew , as a cheating husband and a heartsick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts shifted to Gil . What was Valentine 's Day like for that boy ? And Rosa ? Did she know the state he was in now ? And poor Gil 's mother , having found her boy hanging like a limp rag from the ceiling in her kitchen . As if June Pincus did n't have enough pain in her life already  --  a husband lost at sea to a freak storm , a daughter incarcerated for selling marijuana to ten-year-olds in Boston . <p> " I have n't had a lick of the Scotch , though , " Maryanne said , sitting up straight with pride . " I stuck it on the highest shelf in my attic , so I 'll never get at it unless I make the effort . " <p> " You got to get rid of it , " Ed Sanders said , always the one to jump in when others were n't engaging with Maryanne . " You keep it there , it 's still there in your life , a part of you . " <p> Russell suspected Ed had a crush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew , though he never acted on them , something that annoyed Russell , who was never one to abandon his urges when it came to women and the other potential hazards of life . <p> Rosa 's first boyfriend was Troy Busby , junior lobsterman and son of Liddy and Lou Busby , bartenders at the Whale 's Spout . Troy and Rosa dated early in their teen years , and many thought the two would marry someday , the way they gazed at each other milky-eyed , the fact that they were never apart . But Rosa up and left Troy the night of the school dance only to date his best friend . <p> Gil did n't seem to mind that she always had a boyfriend , or he did n't seem to notice . He began courting her on their fifteenth birthday . He figured it was some kind of fate , them being born on that same day in July in adjacent rooms of the Apple Island Hospital . He sent her letters , left flowers by her locker every day , and at first she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy . She giggled at him and turned away . She rolled her eyes whenever he whispered , " You and me , Rosa ? How about it ? " <p> But soon enough , something in her gave . The two became friends , much to the bewilderment of their classmates . Rosa and Gil were spotted at the movies and library and even once at the junior prom , sitting on the bleachers talking like thieves while the others swept across the dance floor . The chaperones nudged each other . What to make of it ? Knowing Gil , he would n't give up until he absolutely had to . <p> " You got to give him credit , " Russell had said at the meeting the night after Gil had left for California . " He 's always been a persistent little fucker . " <p> Ed had said , " I give him a ton of credit . I give that boy all the credit in the world for shooting out there after the love of his life . " <p> " Of course you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd never up and do anything near like that . " <p> Ed had blushed and frowned , and Russell said , " Maryanne , why do you always need to go and be so damned critical ? " He pulled at his mustache . " What that boy did was n't easy for him . I remember Gil saying to me once he wished he could be more normal . Imagine that ! Normal , like the rest of us slugs . He told me , must have been a year ago , that he wanted to be free of his thing for Rosa . Course I can understand that . No one needs those shackles . Ca n't live much of a life when someone 's burrowed that far inside your skin . " <p> " Russell Alan Barton , no woman 's ever burrowed herself inside you . You send them packing before they do . " <p> " Amen , " Ed had said . <p> " Lies , " Russell 'd mumbled . He 'd become possessed once , ten years ago , before he moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Brooklyn city post office . Their love ( he could n't think of it as an " affair " ) lasted two blissful years . Of course he had no way to know about Nicholas McBain , locked away for bank robbery . Rita had no children , wore no ring . But one Wednesday Nicholas was released from lockup , and , like a guillotine , Rita chopped the cord-left the post office , moved with Nicholas to Tennessee , where he had family and a free place to live . Russell believed he 'd been naive , that he 'd served as a substitute for a man , and not even a decent , moral man . Requited love , he came to think , occurred only with a large dose of delusion . And once you 'd had this kind of love and lost it , in his experience , you could never get it again . <p> Maryanne looked around the room . " We 're all just thinking about Gil and Rosa , are n't we ? " <p> It was unlike Maryanne to notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ache at the base of his neck . Things were bad when Maryanne Kaminski noticed they were . " Sure enough , " he said . <p> " I wonder if Rosa 's going to come back to see him in the hospital . Russ , " Maryanne said , " you hear anything more about his trip ? " <p> " Not a thing . " He sighed . " I 'm guessing that girl took one look at poor Gil and slammed the door in his face . " <p> " Nonsense , " said Maryanne . " Rosa Dean was never one to be rude . Surely she invited him in after his long drive . Surely she gave him a glass of water or something . If it were me , I 'd have taken that boy inside and fed him a good meal . Then again , he 'd probably have eaten it , then gone off to find himself the next goddamn woman . " <p> " Not every man is Munro , " said Ed . <p> Russell shot him a look . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother 's car and driven the width of the country by himself . He 'd showed up all around town the day before , gathering supplies in preparation : he 'd purchased three bottles of water from Munro Kaminski 's gas station , a couple bags of groceries from Ed Sanders at the Shop ' N ' Save , and an audio edition of Men Are from Mars , Women Are from Venus he 'd rented from Maureen at the library . He proudly told each person he saw that day that he was heading west , following love . " Just obeying my ticker , " he said to Maureen as he shoved the audio book into his backpack . And each person who saw him felt a tug inside , a tug not only of pity but one of envy , for they knew that a love strong enough to make you dumb was a rare thing . <p> They gave him farewell gifts , parts of themselves they wanted to go on the journey : Munro Kaminski gave Gil a bottle of his favorite cologne and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Go get her , cowboy " ; Ed Sanders gave him his book of Frost 's poems and plenty of stamps for postcards ; Maryanne Kaminski gave him her camera to take pictures of the Grand Canyon , the place she most wanted to visit and would have years ago , she told herself , if it had n't been for Munro 's wandering eye . <p> Talk show interviews revealed that Rosa Dean had stage fright . Her second with Sky Smith , entertainment news reporter , was the worst . Gil and Maureen and half the island had watched it at the Whale 's Spout over glasses of Coke , mugs of coffee , and plastic bowls of miniature crackers . Rosa stuttered when Sky asked her questions . " I d-d-do n't like to ex-ex-exercise . I just do n't ea-ea-eat much , " she said , and with a shaky hand wound a lock of hair around and around her thumb until the tip turned yellow . Goose bumps rose on the islanders ' arms . <p> Soon after , it was determined that Rosa Dean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a script in the event she should need to be live , which , if the forces of Hollywood had anything to do with it , would not occur . She 'd told her sister who 'd told half the island , who eventually told the other half . By the time the news reached this second half , it became Rosa not wanting to be seen live . " She 's got enough looks she does n't need to talk , " some said . " And if she is n't good at it , why would she want to ? " <p> It killed Gil . He wrote letters to the television station that had aired the interview , demanding Rosa Dean be featured on more programming . He wrote her agent , Richard Ross Eddington , and asked that he try to find her work in TV commercials , not just magazine ads . " I believe , " Gil typed on Russell 's typewriter , " that when she is only allowed to remain on paper a part of Miss Dean 's soul is not being made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not alone in wanting to witness this particular soul . " <p> To no one 's surprise but Gil 's , he never received replies from the executives at the television station . He did receive a postcard from Richard Ross Eddington stating , " Thank you for your interest in Eddington Talent , Inc . We 'll keep your information on file , but at the present time your talents would not be a good match for our current entertainment needs . " <p> It was Rosa 's stage fright that finally sent Gil to pack his bags . He must have figured , in some crazy way , that he could save her , that he could pluck her from the world where she was only allowed to be seen and not heard , and that he could bring her back home to a better place . <p> Maryanne cleared her throat . " Maureen said something about Rosa having a beau , some underwear model or something , and that when Gil took a look at this guy , he just got right back in his car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been that simple , " said Ed . " Gil 's no dummy . He said he called Rosa before he left and told her he was coming out . She had the opportunity to tell him not to come . I bet it was more complicated . I bet she did , for a while , entertain the idea of herself and Gil , you know , together . Or something . " <p> " Ha , Ed , that 's just a man 's way of thinking , " said Maryanne , remembering the last time she saw Gil following Rosa and her friends through the center of town , a look of hope on his face . " That girl never gave one serious thought to a relationship with Gil . " <p> Although requited love between the two seemed impossible , no one else wanted to be the one to say it aloud . <p> " Maryanne , take it easy , " said Russell . <p> " I 'm just speaking the truth . " <p> Ed said , " Let 's say that she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sunny house , and her face is aching from smiling so much , and old Gil calls , a voice from the past , a sense of home right there coming through the telephone line , and she tells him , ' Sure thing you come out here . It 'd be nice to see someone from home . ' And out comes Gil , and she sees him , and for a minute , her pity for him becomes homesickness and then something else . It 's been known to happen . " He looked at Celia , remembering their one night at her place up-island . He 'd been gone two months on a fishing trip near Nova Scotia with Russell , and the whole time he 'd wanted a bottle more than anything . All that quiet , all that time to think about the fact that he 'd never married , never even slipped inside a love that lasted more than a moment . Back home Celia came into his store to buy flour and baking soda , and she looked up at him through her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Welcome home , " even though she 'd known him for years . He could n't help himself . <p> Celia sighed , and excused herself to go use the restroom . She was the quietest , most tangled member of the group-she was addicted to alcohol , sex , food , driving . She could be seen all hours of the day and night driving the circumference of the island , drifting left and right , staring ahead as if there had to be something , anything akin to salvation right in front of her if only she could just reach it . When Gil left for California she gathered a care package for him : a plastic tub of homemade oatmeal cookies , a laminated road map , a first-aid kit . The night before he left she found herself sitting on her front stoop , wondering for a moment whether Gil would think her crazy if she asked him whether she could join him . Shoveling the cookies in her mouth , Celia knew she 'd never muster up the courage to ask the boy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassed and bone-tired to go find him , anyway . <p> When Celia came back from the restroom , Russell and Maryanne were arguing . Celia thought this group should be renamed Love Anonymous . Then again it was n't love they were addicted to , it could n't have been , for not one of them was currently or had been , in the four years she 'd been attending meetings , in the throes of that great and elusive thing . But it was what they spent the most time talking about . Not the struggle to stay away from Liquor World , not the sting and throb of the morning after a three-day bender . <p> " You ca n't tell me that for an instant that girl- " <p> " Listen here , Maryanne . Just listen , " Russell interrupted . " Gil shows up at her door , expecting to spend a few days in sunny California and to convince her , somehow , some way , to come back with him to Apple . He thinks she 's unhappy out there-she ca n't talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without makeup , ca n't eat more than a meal a day . " Rosa 's sister had shared a letter with him describing the meal Rosa ate each day : steamed chicken breast , two spears asparagus , two crackers , one bite chocolate bar . Who would n't think she had cause to be unhappy ? " She comes to the door expecting the mailman or someone , and there 's old Gil , his arms full of roses , no doubt , and she smiles and laughs . See , she 's forgotten about him , forgotten someone loves her so much he 'd jump in a car and drive 2,500 miles and shove a hundred roses in her face . She grins and laughs . It 's so easy , she thinks . He loves me regardless of anything , of everything . He is the good in all of this , the reason for all of this . He wants to see my face more than anyone alive , and it does n't matter if I have a lick of makeup on , or if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . He does . It 's a kind of relief . She invites him in , makes him a sandwich . He fills her in on all the gossip here . Munro Kaminski 's sleeping around again "  --  Russell nudged Maryanne , who gasped and then shoved him away  --  " Russell Barton 's whining about his troubles , or his lack of troubles , at that damned meeting each week . And all Rosa can do is look at that boy , who once was as ugly as an oyster to her , and see nothing but how much he loves her . It 's what she wants . It 's what she 's been looking for out here in California but unable to find . Out here everyone 's pretty , and it does n't make a bit of difference . Pretty does n't make them fall in love with you . She does n't know what does anymore . That underwear model she 's been seeing , let 's call him , say , Mitch , he 's more concerned with keeping the flat of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her , with telling her anything more intimate and promising than ' Rosa , do n't eat that bite of chocolate or your ass will balloon . ' " Russell cleared his throat and closed his eyes . <p> Maryanne shuffled in her seat . " And ? " <p> " So they talk and talk , " Russell said , his eyes still closed , " and Rosa gets so intoxicated by the force of Gil 's feelings for her  --  they 're all she can see now  --  she reaches over and kisses him , at first like she 'd kiss a friend , quick and dry , on the cheek , and she pulls back , and Gil looks at her , his feelings for her stronger than they 've ever been , and she leans in again , this time for longer , this time for real . " <p> Maryanne shook her head and rolled her eyes . " I do n't buy it ! " <p> But Ed listened rapt . Celia kept her palms together in front of her face . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russell continued , opening his eyes and turning them to Maryanne . " Gil 's barely able to keep his feet on the ground-he feels as if he could float off to Pluto at any moment . And Rosa , well , she feels safe and tucked in and loved , beloved , for the first time in years , since she got to California . Everything 's swell , like in the movies for those twenty-four hours . They go walking on the beach , talk about how different it looks there from here : out east the coast is rockier , less forgiving . Rosa tells him how crazy her life 's gotten  --  all the money , the attention . She ca n't go anywhere without people nudging each other and pointing at her . Gil listens and savors every word . They spend long minutes kissing . They hold hands . They feel as if they 've reached something they 've both been looking for . Gil tries to convince Rosa to come back home , leave the craziness behind and come with him and live a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She thinks about packing up and driving back with Gil , returning to all her old friends and her family , whom she 's beginning to lose touch with due to her busy schedule and constant traveling . Gil sees she 's taking his suggestions seriously and inside he prays : Let this time continue forever . Let her come home with me . Until  --  " Russell bit his lip . He thought a moment . <p> " Until ? " said Ed . <p> " Until the next morning , they wake up next to each other and look out the window , and there it is , two men putting up a billboard of Rosa in a bikini advertising suntan lotion . Gil leans over and , in an attempt to continue persuading her to move back home , says , ' What 'll happen when you 're old , when you lose your beauty ? What will you have cultivated then ? ' And Rosa says , ' What does cultivate mean ? ' " <p> The members snickered , and then grew silent again . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wrong they wo n't let you talk ? ' and she says , ' I 'm not good at talking , or acting , or any of that . I 'm only good at smiling . ' Gil says , ' Horseshit . You 're good at listening . You 're good to people like me that other people are n't always good to . Jesus , Rosa , you are good . Good is you . ' And Rosa likes what she hears , and curls up beside him . <p> " But part of her does n't believe it . If she is good , why is she already thinking that the billboard is a little crooked , and that her thighs look pudgy in it , and that Mitch will be there soon to pick her up and go to the gym and that she 'd better get rid of Gil , or Mitch will laugh him all the way back to the Atlantic ? These are not good thoughts . Gil thinks he knows me but he does n't . I 'm not all good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pours Gil a glass of orange juice , tells him some places he should visit while she goes about her daily business . And before Mitch comes , she sends him off , trekking around Hollywood , looking at the sign and the boulevard and all the fancy people in their silk and leather clothes . And here 's the hard part , here 's where it gets painful . " Russell looked around the room , out the window at the tangle of branches and the smoky February sky . " While Gil 's out , Rosa decides that Mitch ca n't know about him . No one here can . They wo n't understand . They wo n't take him seriously . They 'll think he 's some kind of deranged fan . So , while she 's at the gym , she decides not to go home that evening , to stay at Mitch 's place . It 's the only way , disappearing . Otherwise she 'll get sucked back in by pity and false hopes for goodness and whatever else it was that made her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , when she knows he 'll be out , she goes to her place and leaves a note on the door , telling him she had to head out of town suddenly for a shoot . She 's being flown to Italy-not really a lie , she 's going the next week , so she does n't feel one hundred percent rotten-and she 's sorry they could n't spend more time together , but he should have a good visit , and here are more things you can see here . She does n't feel good doing it , I 'm not saying that . But she does it , and part of her feels relieved . So Gil goes about his business around town , and when he comes back to Rosa 's , carrying a bottle of wine and more flowers  --  " <p> Celia leaned her forehead against the spire of her hands and sighed . <p> " He finds the note and feels angry and melancholy at once .

Then he drives around , finds a restaurant called China Hut that Rosa had suggested in her note , and parks at the far end of the lot . He gives the wine to a bum sitting on the curb and goes inside . And who does he see there ? Who forgets that she told him about China Hut ? She 's sitting at the bar with Mitch , tossing her hair and laughing and moving her long fingers up his biceps . Gil stands at the front door like a brick just struck him , watching them , a fire in his chest , his head tight and pulsing . He pivots and goes back to his car , grabs the bottle back from the bum "  --  Russell smiled  --  " and begins his journey back . He 's not going to spend another night in this evil place .

Until he gets home , the place he 'd expected to be free from it , and everywhere he turns is her face . On magazines . In her friends . In the lobster his mother makes him for dinner that her father undoubtedly caught . So that night , after his mother sets off for bed , he ca n't take it another second . He makes himself look at the remainder of the lobster , now sitting on top of the garbage , makes himself look that red bug right in its dead eyes and musters up enough hurt to do what he knows he needs to  --  leave this world where there 's no good .

That 's it , that 's all . You do n't want me to go into the rest , you already know everything . The rope , the fan , the hospital . " <p> Ed breathed out slowly , deflating his posture until he was slumped in his chair . <p> They knew now what had happened ; they knew what would have happened had Gil 's love been requited , and deep down inside themselves , so deep they had no access to it , they knew that the only way Gil 's love would be requited would be in this room . They felt so full and empty they could barely sit still . <p> Russell looked at his watch and realized they 'd gone twenty minutes over their hour and a half . " We going over to Maureen 's ?

" said Russell . <p> " It seems to me Maureen might like to be alone or just with her family right about now . You know ? " <p> " Exactly , " Ed said , relieved . <p> The room grew quiet again . After a few moments , Celia whispered , " Russ ? Could you go back and tell it again ? " <p> " Huh ? " Russell said . He looked at Celia , unsure , as always , of what she was talking about . There she sat , a halo of beige fuzz above her face , her eyes two times their size behind those glasses . <p> " Could you tell us about those twenty-four hours , about Gil walking on air and Rosa , too , and them comparing the beaches there and here ? Could you tell that part again ? But this time , go slower .

Russell lifted his shoulders , pressed his palms to his knees , and moved his legs apart on the floor , grounding himself . <p> " Go on , Russ , " said Ed . <p> Russell looked as if he were preparing for an important task . Indeed he wondered if he was up to it , if he could muster up any more details from thin air . But he closed his eyes and drew a deep breath , and , in a moment , he began . <p> <p> By Heidi Pitlor <p>
