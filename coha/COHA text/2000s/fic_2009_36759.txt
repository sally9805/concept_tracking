Defiance , Texas <p> It had been thirty roller-coaster years since Daisy Marie Chance forced fourteen-year-old Jed Pepper to fall in love with her . He 'd obliged her , dizzied at the thought ever since . It had been that long before Jed could walk through the ruins of Crooked Creek Church , a butterfly flitting a prophecy he never could believe , even today . It was Daisy 's singsong words that gave the butterfly its bewitching manner , those same words that strangled him with newfound love . For years , he wished he 'd had an Instamatic camera to capture the moment he fell for Daisy , but then entropy would 've had its way , fading and creasing Daisy 's face until she 'd have looked like an overloved newspaper recipe , wrinkled and unreadable . <p> Thing was , he could always read Daisy 's face . Even then . She 'd looked at him square in the eyes that day in 1977 , in the exact same spot he stood now , and declared , " Your family ai n't normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , he 'd thought , of course my family 's normal . Anyone with eyes could see that . Daisy said a lot of words , being a thirteen-year-old girl and all , but these did n't make much sense . <p> Thirty years later they did . They screamed the truth through the empty field where the church used to creak in the wind . <p> For a hesitant moment , enshrined in the ruins of his childhood , Jed was fourteen again . Filled to the brim with testosterone and pestered by an orange and black tormenter and Daisy 's oh-so-true words . <p> " Your family ai n't normal , Jed . " <p> He watched the butterfly loop above the organ , never landing , like it had a thing against church music . Or maybe dust . <p> He sat on a rickety pew . <p> " Jed ? " <p> He clasped his hands around his ears , hoping Daisy 's words would run away . He hummed " A Mighty Fortress Is Our God . " <p> She put her nose right in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her Juicy Fruit breath . " You in there ? " <p> He swatted the air between them , hoping she 'd disappear . " Yeah . Quit bothering me . " He looked at his watch . Six fifteen . Time to go . <p> " But your face . " Daisy sat down a Bible 's throw away . <p> Jed touched his swollen eye . " Yeah ? So ? What about it ? " <p> " It looks like it hurts . " Daisy scooted closer . She reached her arm his direction . <p> He inched away . <p> " The truth , Jed . How 'd you get that shiner ? " <p> He watched the butterfly . " I was stupid . Ran my face into a corner . " Thirty seconds had ticked . The watch clicked like a stopwatch , pestering him . <p> " Faces do n't mess with corners , Jed . " <p> " Mine did . Chasing Sissy around the house . She said it was n't fair because I was bigger . She tied a bandana around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another well-told lie , almost as good as Hap 's stories from the pulpit . Six sixteen . Time to go . <p> Daisy shook her head . Her long blonde braid whipped back and forth like a tire swing over a swimming hole . She hated bangs , something her mom , Miss Emory , knew but hacked away at them a few weeks ago anyway , leaving them a crooked mess . Daisy still steamed about it , but her only protest was two yellow clips with smiling daisies pulling the jagged bangs away from her forehead . <p> " I love you , you know . " <p> Jed 's face warmed . " Would you quit that please ? There 's no room for talk like that . " <p> " Why not ? This is church , right ? Are n't you supposed to say love in church ? Besides , you know what street I live on . " <p> Jed rolled his eyes . " Love Street . " <p> " That 's right . " <p> " I do n't see how that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference . It 's destiny , what street you live on . " Daisy turned away from Jed , pulled her braid to her mouth . She bit its stubbled end and groaned like she was gritting teeth . Her angry noise . <p> The monarch flew in circles in front of Daisy , as if it were trying to lift her mood by dancing on air . It lit upon the pew between the two of them , wings folded up toward the ceiling in prayer . <p> Daisy bent near the monarch , but the butterfly did n't flinch . " It means something , sure enough , " she whispered . <p> " What 's gotten into you ? It 's tired , that 's all . And it happened to sit down right there . " Jed pointed his finger at the motionless butterfly . <p> With one tentative hop , the monarch left the dusty pew for Jed 's dirt-stained fingernail . It seemed to study his face while the sun shone through its papery wings . It flapped once and then flew clear away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows . <p> They sat in pew four listening to doves calling each other . <p> Jed checked his watch . Nearly twenty after . <p> " It 's a sign . Jed Pepper , you 're going to change the world . You 've been chosen . " <p> " You 're frustrating . " Jed stood . <p> " Am not . " <p> " Are too . " Jed scatted the air with a wave of his hand , as if doing that would erase the words Daisy spoke , an aerial Etch A Sketch . <p> He walked Crooked Creek Church 's middle aisle backwards , like a sinner unrepentant , while Daisy chattered away . Part of him wanted to leave her behind for good , but another part wanted to listen to her forever and a year . He 'd welcome her words to fill the silence of his home . <p> " Hey , Jed ? " <p> " Now what ? " <p> " You be careful . " <p> " I will . " <p> " Promise ? " <p> " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Mama does . Every single day . Should I add you to the list ? " Her voice got that empty sound whenever she spoke of Miss Emory-a longing for something her mama could n't or would n't give her . <p> He considered his answer . Daisy 's mama scatted her like she was an interrupting fruit fly half the time . He did n't want to treat her the same . " No , never mind . Forget I said it . " <p> " I 'm a good forgetter . " She smiled . He could n't help but smile in return . " I got ta go . " If he ran , he 'd make it . <p> Daisy stepped out into the aisle , hands on hips . " I 'm going to marry you someday . You wait and see . " <p> Jed rolled his eyes . Girls . <p> " I 'm going to put on a long white dress and you 're going to wear a fine suit . We 're going to tend birds . I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through an open window , looping frantically through the church , flying crazy-winged out where it came from in a flustering of wings against windowpane . For a moment , everything was silent . Dead quiet . <p> " God 's been here , " Daisy whispered , looking haunted-eyed at Jed . <p> He looked away . <p> She tapped him on the shoulder . " And when we 're married , we 're going to have six kids-all girls . Want to know their names ? " This time her eyes spelled mischief . <p> " Not hardly . " <p> " Petunia , Hollyhock , Primrose , Begonia , Dahlia , and Buttercup . " <p> Jed leaned against the back pew , eyeing the door of escape . " Sounds more like a garden than a batch of kids . " He knew he should leave , but Daisy held some sort of annoying girl spell over him . <p> " Very funny . " <p> " I need to head home . " Jed turned . He opened the back door . He 'd come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to leave proper this time . Besides , it was the closest way to escape Daisy 's sentences . Next thing , she 'd be talking about perfume or how smooth babies ' skin was or going on about the butterfly 's hidden meaning . Anyone knew he would n't change the world . Not today at least . He 'd be happy to make it through one day . <p> Daisy followed him . " You going to leave me here alone ? I traipsed all the way from town to come here . " <p> " It 's not like we do n't meet here every single day . You 'll be fine . How many times have you walked home from here ? A thousand ? Two ? " <p> " It 's a long walk . " <p> " For crying out loud , Daisy , this is Defiance , Texas . There 's nothing to be afraid of . Besides , you 've got God 's eye for protection . " <p> She looked away , did n't say a word while seconds ticked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out . " You 'll regret it . " The western sun shone through the church 's broken-out windows , brightening the left side of Daisy 's face . She looked almost like an angel , that is if angels had braided hair and prattled on and on . <p> " See you later , " he called over his shoulder . <p> Jed shut the door , knowing Daisy preferred crawling out of the church like a fugitive . Ever since she read a book about Anne who holed up from Nazis , she 'd taken to hiding and sneaking . He tied baler twine around the doorknob and a piece of wood sticking out from the doorframe , securing the door . <p> He faced his world in that moment , let its significance and fury sink into his heart . Would he change the world ? Hard to say . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
