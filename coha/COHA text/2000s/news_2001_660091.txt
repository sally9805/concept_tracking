<p> If you want to build a boat to ride in , an easy chair to sit in , or even a scale-model skyscraper that reaches to the ceiling , think " cardboard . " It 's hard to find a more adaptable , less expensive , or more available building material . More than 90 percent of all products in the United States are shipped in corrugated-paper boxes . Mattresses come in them . So do refrigerators , dishwashers , bicycles , and televisions . You 've played with corrugated-cardboard boxes before . Perhaps you 've studied them and discovered the secret of their sturdiness . Corrugated boxes have at least three layers : two flat sheets ( the " liners " ) with a wavy layer ( " fluting " ) glued in between . It took a while for people to figure out what corrugated paper was good for . The first corrugated material was used as a sweatband lining for tall men 's hats in Victorian England . That was in 1856 . In 1871 , corrugated paper was being used to protect kerosene- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1800s , liners had been added and the material was being used to make boxes . Corrugated boxes began replacing heavy , expensive wooden crates . According to one prominent economist , the corrugated box is one of recent history 's greatest , most overlooked inventions . " It 's really an incredible product that we never think about , " Russell Roberts of Washington University told National Public Radio in 1999 . It 's a great , overlooked building material , too . Most corrugated is easy to cut , requiring only determination and a strong pair of scissors . A box knife or small handsaw makes easy work of thicker corrugated . ( But you 'll need to ask a grown-up to help you . ) <p> Corrugated projects to try * Throughout the spring and summer , kids and grown-ups build kayaks , long barges , model paddle-wheelers , and other fanciful boats . They enter them in The Great Cardboard Boat Regatta , a series of events held in cities across the United States . * Schoolteacher Michael Lipinski helps his fifth- and sixth-graders build a model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elementary School . They use empty appliance boxes provided by a local store . * You may have seen the episode of " Zoom , " the PBS-TV show , in which New York teenager Nick Young designed and built a lounge chair from sheets of corrugated . Richard Archer , now retired , was a professor of art and design at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale . He organized the first cardboard boat regatta in 1974 as a student problem-solving exercise . " I was looking for a project that seemed impossible , " he says . About 10 cardboard-boat regattas are held each year . Entrants create an impressive array of watercraft . Some are comical , made to look like everything from cars to cows to tanks . Boats in a team competition may be more than 100 feet long . Many are built by parents and children working together . Not all of the boats are seaworthy . Those that do n't float very well are eligible for the " Titanic Award . " But the fact that most of them can be raced over a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's versatility . ( Hint : Five or six coats of enamel floor paint or polyurethane deck finish vastly improves the boats ' water-resistance . ) " I know that for every boat that makes it to a race , " Mr. Archer says , " the people working on it have solved a host of problems . What length should the boat be ? What width ? How high should the side walls be ? " This kind of problem-solving builds teamwork as well as design skills . The first year a regatta is held , Archer says , about half the boats sink slowly as the cardboard absorbs water . ( All sailors must wear life jackets . ) The next year , only about one-third of the boats end up sinking as entrants learn from their mistakes ( or from **27;64;TOOLONG workshops ) . <p> Create your own skyscraper If boatbuilding is n't your thing , maybe try to design a city . Every other year , students at the Erving Elementary School build model skyscrapers out of corrugated . They look very realistic . Before starting construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program ( SimCity 2000 ) that simulates the city-building process . The computer screen , of course , only offers images in two dimensions . In order to grasp the three-dimensional aspects of city buildings , each student crafts his or her own building . First , students must obtain " building permits " from the teacher . To do this , they submit sketches of buildings they studied in class , as well as a detailed drawing of an original building design . They must include a list of specifications : how tall the building will be , how wide , and so on . In order to make sure that the buildings look as though they belong together , they must be in proportion . Everybody must use the same scale : one inch on the model equals 10 feet . This allows the model structures to be impressively large without going through the ceiling . Toy vehicles of about the same scale ( Matchbox or Hot Wheels cars ) can be put at the base of the buildings and look realistic . A 60-story building winds up being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are told not to build any higher than they can reach ( without using a ladder ) . The sides of the building are cut from corrugated board and glued to a substructure made from 1-by-1-inch wooden strips . ( A hot-glue gun makes quick work of this , but regular white glue is fine , too . ) To achieve a high degree of realism , a computer is used to design the " skin " of the buildings . Erving students use the " Draw " module of AppleWorks , but similar results are possible using other graphics programs . Using a computer , it 's easy to experiment with different " looks . " Once a full-page panel is designed and approved , it 's a simple matter to print it out and photocopy it . The white edges of the copies are cut off , and the copies are applied to the exposed cardboard of the building using glue sticks . This method eliminates the tedious work of hand-drawing or painting hundreds of windows and other building details . This also guarantees a uniform , professional appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of black . That uses up a lot of toner in the photocopier . ) Students add custom touches : Markers are used to color the " skin " ; towers are added - even construction-paper swimming pools on the roofs . The whole project takes several days to complete . When everyone is finished , the buildings are arranged together to form a city . The students are proud of their work . Some take the buildings home to display in their bedrooms . <p> By Ross Atkin Corrugated 's secret lies in the inner , wavy layer . The shape ( and glue ) adds lots of strength . Freight shipped in corrugated boxes was often refused by railroads in the 1890s . It took a federal order in 1903 to establish the boxes as a valid way to ship items . Welcome to Cardboard City Fifth- and sixth-graders at the Erving ( Mass . ) Elementary School take city planning into their own hands . They design and build a scale-model city . It 's a popular assignment , and one that requires lots of time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advises fellow teachers , unless you are : willing to devote lots of class time to it ; have access to lots of large pieces of cardboard ( see below ) ; are handy with basic cutting tools , staplers , glue guns ; and can tolerate a messy classroom for days at a time . For more details , skyscraper ' window ' templates , and more see the school 's website : www.fi.edu/ **44;93;TOOLONG The school uses cardboard donated by a local business . For this and other major cardboard projects ( boats , chairs - we 've seen photos of cardboard sled competitions , too ) , check with appliance stores and other merchants that receive products shipped in large boxes . You can also look in the Yellow Pages under " Paper Products " for companies that will sell corrugated sheets . Recycling bins are also a good source . ( Ask first . ) Sail away in a boxy boat SO , ARE YOU READY to try making your own cardboard boat ? You will definitely need a grown-up 's enthusiastic cooperation to design , build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the pros to get you started : * To get clean folds in corrugated cardboard , make a creasing tool . Buy a large metal screw eye at a hardware store . Buy a big one , so the loop will compress the cardboard without cutting into it . Look for a screw eye that 's about two inches in diameter , in other words . Drill a hole in the end of a wooden handle ( a section of old broomstick , perhaps ) , and screw in the screw eye . Use this lollipop-shaped tool and a sturdy straightedge ( a board , maybe ) to crease the cardboard before you fold it . Nice bends are the result . * Carpenter 's glue , sold in hardware and home-improvement stores , is the preferred adhesive . School-type white glues are OK for corrugated constructions that will stay dry , but weaker white glues are likely to wash out in water . * The best way to seal joints is with silicone caulking compounds . ( Again , this is for boat construction . ) Silicone adhesives come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a caulking gun to apply . ( Read and follow all safety directions when using this kind of caulk. ) * Use nuts and bolts ( not screws ) to hold layers of corrugated board together . Use thin-shafted carriage bolts with wide washers ( called " fender washers " ) at either end . The washers improve the bolt 's surface-holding area . Be careful that protruding bolt ends do n't create a hazard . Hint : Cardboard boats are very light , and do not displace much water . In other words , they do n't sink into the water much . Experienced cardboard boaters know to make the hulls of their craft flat-bottomed , rather than V-shaped . Flat-bottomed cardboard boats are much less likely to tip over . Also , boaters should sit directly on the bottom of the boat to lower its center of gravity and further improve stability . Be careful ! Always wear a life jacket .

The New York City teen designed and built a one-of-a-kind lounge chair ( pictured at right ) with the help of his architect father . He first made a " crush tester " to see how much weight the corrugated could support . That helped him design a strong chair . He used big sheets of new cardboard , bought from a supplier , for the project . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2001 . The Christian Science Monitor
