HandBOOK Headnote GEAR , TUNE-UPS AND TRUTH Headnote Silence Noisy Wheels // My road rim " ticks " when I brake . Should I be nervous ? - Mel Feldman , NJ You should be , Mel , you should be . Well , at least concerned . Most likely , your rim simply has a " step " where it was joined . This is common with inexpensive rims . High-quality hoops , such as Mavic SUPs , have welds that are machined perfectly smooth , so there 's no tick . But you could have a more sinister problem . Check for small pieces of metal embedded in your brake pads . This would cause ticking , and it means you 're working grooves into your rim every time you brake . Eventually the rim will fail . The fix is easy : Dig out the metal with a sharp knife , then sand the pads smooth . Or , easier yet : Buy new pads . Hydraulic discs or hydraulic rim brakes ? I do some , trials riding , so I need stoppers that lock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of your riding in dry conditions or in clean water , go with Magura hydraulic rim brakes with trials pads . They rule on clean , dry rims . For true mountain trail work or muddy rides , do discs . North Shore ? Discs , as it doth get mucky there . You might also consider the Avid mechanical discs ; they 're very bitey and a great value . What 4-inch-travel fork would you put on a Rocky Mountain Instinct if you rode the technical terrain of Vancouver , BC ? Fox Forx Float RLC , Manitou Black or RockShox Psylo ?  --  Shamus Dillon , BC I 'd be happy with any of those . I 'm partial to the Fox , for its buttery-smooth damping action ( the best of any I 've ever tried ) . I suggest staying with Fox 's cheaper R model , because you may never use the lockout or compression-damping adjustments on the RLC . The Psylo 's dial  --  adjustable travel can be handy , and the Tullio 20mm-axle version of the Psylo is a stiff , precise  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Black , but it felt good . With these three good choices , it sounds like the only thing you have to lose are some teeth . I put narrow slicks on my Rhyno Lite rims to commute , but they pop off . Are they too narrow ? - Gary Tosh , NV You can usually put 1.25-inch slicks on regular XC-width rims just fine , but Rhyno Lites are wide . Here 's how to tell if your tire is too narrow for your rim : Install the 1.25s and inflate to 60 psi . If the tires do n't pop off in the first few hours , they should be okay to ride . If it was my butt on the saddle , " okay " would n't be good enough . I 'd go with 1.5-inch tires on those mondo rims . You wo n't feel much difference in speed anyway . I ca n't inflate my tires to their max pressure because my floor pump keeps popping off the valve stem . Advice ? - Kent Gifford , CA Position the wheel so you can hold the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slot in the middle of a section of old inner tube . Make the hole just barely large enough for the chuck to squeeze through . Then place the chuck on the valve , and tightly tie the ends of the tube around the tire . Do n't fork with your Uncle .
