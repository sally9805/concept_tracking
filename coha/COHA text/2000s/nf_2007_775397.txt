The Durham heat burned through Devon Sherwood ? s jersey as he waited for the lacrosse team he longed to join to come from the locker room . It was his eighteenth birthday , September 16 , 2005 . Shifting his feet on the green turf , he pondered the challenge ahead . // The lanky freshman had been a good high school goalie in Freeport , Long Island  --  good enough to be recruited by five small colleges and offered a probable starting position by prestigious Williams . // Duke had been a different story . A lacrosse powerhouse , it had come within a goal of winning the national championship in May 2005 . This year ? s team was even more loaded with talent , and widely seen as the one to beat in 2006 . Mike Pressler , the 2005 NCAA lacrosse coach of the year , could fill his twelve scholarship slots with high school all-Americans and near all-Americans . Devon had not made that cut . // He chose Duke anyway . His father , Chuck , had played lacrosse for Duke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campus , Pressler had greeted them warmly , encouraging Devon to try out as a walk-on. // Few walk-ons make the roster in big-time college sports . Even fewer get playing time . And Duke was as big-time as lacrosse gets . So Devon ? s excitement was tinged with apprehension as the forty-five blue-helmeted figures came jogging onto the field . They formed two perfect lines , in full battle array , down to the fierce-looking face masks that in a few months would  --  along with charges of gang rape and racism  --  fix the team ? s image on the nation ? s television screens . // Showtime , Devon thought . Will I win their respect ? Will they accept me ? // One by one , the forty-five figures came up to the rookie , shook hands , introduced themselves , wished him luck . They didn ? t have to do that , he thought . // Two weeks and dozens of saves later , Coach Pressler called Devon into his office . Was he having a good time ? Was he ready for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Devon was ready . He would be the third-string goalie . But he was sure he had to be the happiest person alive . Happy , and eager to improve . He had big shoes to fill . Chuck Sherwood , Duke ? s first African-American lacrosse player , had set goalkeeping records , including most saves in a game . // Now Devon would be the only black guy on a team with forty-six white guys . His contributions to team culture included a rap song incorporating every teammate ? s name or nickname , depending on which rhymed better . Everyone had at least one nickname . Devon ? s was " D-Wood. " // The practices were grueling : at least fifteen hours a week in the fall and twenty-two hours in the spring of lacrosse drills , scrimmages , running , and weight lifting . Plus a full course load . Plus , for Devon , getting to know as many of Duke ? s other six hundred black undergraduates as he could . // Many of the other lacrosse players hung together off as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in part because there were so many of them , and for going around in large , sometimes loud , often conspicuous groups , and for drunken revelry that stood out even at a legendary party school . In fact , aside from their visibility , their behavior was not atypical of many other Duke students , but it made the lacrosse players an unusually inviting target for those displeased with the Duke status quo. // One of the nation ? s ten top academic institutions , Duke could fill most seats in every entering class with high school valedictorians . It had also earned a national reputation as a hedonistic scene of wild antics and rampant sexual " hookups "  --  mostly one-night stands  --  marinated in oceans of alcohol . // Fraternities and sororities , informally ranked , dominated the social scene , which was mostly off campus because of Duke ? s strict drinking rules . With the young women as eager for sexual conquests as the guys , the female-male ratio and the balance of sexual power favored the alpha males , especially at Duke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own initiation , a fact that became public in 2006 but was all but ignored by the media . // Inevitably the most extreme parties worked their way into the media as if they reflected normal affairs . A January 2005 bacchanal , for instance , brought national publicity . Police raiding an off-campus rental house jammed with two hundred students found coeds in bikinis , emulating the movie Old School by wrestling in a kiddie pool full of baby oil while beer-swilling boys watched and cheered . The scene was reminiscent of the raucous Saint Ray fraternity parties in Tom Wolfe ? s I Am Charlotte Simmons . Set at fictional Dupont University , which Wolfe modeled largely on Duke , the novel tells the story of a sheltered but extraordinarily bright student from a small North Carolina town who arrives in search of intellectual challenge and emotional growth . What she finds is a place where star athletes outrank star students and the route to social acceptance is a booze- and sex-obsessed culture of hard partying male athletes and scantily clad sorority girls . Charlotte dutifully , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as at Wolfe ? s Dupont , it was not all fun . Some women brought impressive academic and other credentials , only to become " unhappy , insecure girls all fighting to get rammed by someone of status , " wrote Dukeobsrvr , an anonymous student blogger . All this provoked much gnashing of teeth and agonizing among Duke faculty and administrators , especially those concerned about equality and dignity for women . // " Men and women agree the double standard persists : men gain status through sexual activity while women lose status , " complained a high-level , female-dominated group chaired by then-president Nannerl O. Keohane , a major 2003 report by the Steering Committee for the Women ? s Initiative at Duke University on the lives of women at Duke . " Fraternities control the mainstream social scene to such an extent that women feel like they play by the men ? s rules . Social life is further complicated by a number of embedded hierarchies , from the widely understood ranking of Greek organizations to the opposite trajectories women and men take over four years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a less jaundiced view . What feminist professors and some others saw as hedonistic excess , many female students saw as being liberated and proud . " Duke was best summarized by a ? Work hard , play hard ? mentality , " recalled a 2006 grad . " While some burned the candle too close , others were able to handle successfully all of their responsibilities and took pride in doing so . " // The party scene  --  or what was left of it after various purges by the Duke administration in recent years  --  was only one of Duke ? s many parts . Most students either stayed away from the wild parties to focus on academics and extracurricular activities or worked as hard as they played . // Most  --  but hardly all  --  of the forty-seven lacrosse players were in the latter category , and something like a bunch of big-man-on-campus fraternity brothers . " In the order of the social universe of Duke undergraduates , " Peter Boyer wrote in The New Yorker , " the lacrosse players ranked at the top of the dominance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a healthy self-confidence was in the eye of the beholder . " ? Laxers , ? as lacrosse players are universally known , tend to be the most desired and most confident guys on campus , " wrote Janet Reitman in Rolling Stone . " They ? re fun . And they ? re hot . " A more jaundiced view of some of the players came from Carly Knight , a third-year student . After the gang-rape allegations against the team broke , she told the Chronicle , the school ? s newspaper , that they exuded " an extreme amount of arrogance , " urinated out their windows , kicked in the door of a friend several times , and were generally disruptive during frequent parties in a room near hers . To such caricatures , Chris Kennedy , an associate athletic director and the administrator closest to the team , had an obvious retort , if one often ignored in the spring and summer of 2006 : " The lacrosse players didn ? t become among the most popular students on campus because they treated people boorishly. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the leaders of the pack at the most spectacular , and notorious , regular party scene of all  --  a Saturday morning , pre-football-game festival of keg parties , binge drinking , beer bonging , outrageous costume wearing , and other hijinks known as Tailgate , held in a parking lot near the stadium . The laxers " are credited with helping to transform tailgate from a small pre-game gathering to a campus-wide drinking event in the last several years , " reported The Chronicle . One highlight was a foam machine and pit for collective , booze-soaked dancing . But the lacrosse station at Tailgate attracted the most attention because of the players ? habit of colorful , often wild , costumes and the obvious fun the players had at the affair . // This was the main opportunity for the laxers to cut loose ; they began rigorous training for the spring season in early February and were busy playing games and practicing during the spring break and post-exam Myrtle Beach bashes enjoyed by many other Duke students . // Much of what went on at these parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right-wing Christian conservatives  --  as good clean fun . // A student later recalled the tradition with fondness : // Some tailgates had every lacrosse team member dress like a WWF wrestler from the eighties and each person mock-wrestled in front of close to a hundred or more tailgaters . The last tailgate party was amazing . About ten guys from the team stayed up all night and built a foam pit that probably measured twenty feet by ten feet and had blue tarp on the sides so that the foam could rise almost three to four feet . The deans , including Dean Sue Wasiolek , were amazed . There are countless letters from people to coach Pressler saying how amazing our tailgates were . Our tailgates were positive . One alum wrote that since he had overcome cancer it was the best part of his new life . // But there was an uglier side to Tailgate . The liability-shy university had pushed the inevitable student drinkathons off campus , and as a foreseeable consequence many students were falling-down drunk by early afternoon . ( No lacrosse players were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And with Duke ? s football team expected to take a drubbing most of the time  --  it was the weakest of the major Duke teams , and in the 2004 , 2005 , and 2006 seasons defeated only one Division I opponent  --  many students treated Tailgate as the main event , showing up at the football games late or not at all . // Things got so out of hand that the new baseball coach made a show of banning his team  --  whose image had been tarnished by a recent steroid scandal  --  from Tailgate . At the request of the administration , Mike Pressler let his team attend but laid down a rule requiring all lacrosse players at Tailgate to leave as a group fifteen minutes before game time and watch at least the first half . They had to check in with the coach before entering the stadium , so he could see whether any had had too much to drink ; on a few occasions , several players recall seeing Duke president Richard Brodhead as they went in to watch the football game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them it looked like they were having a good time . // Players complied with Pressler ? s dictate and went in to the game , but they were virtually alone in doing so . Administration hopes that other students would follow were dashed . So the university forced those who stayed at Tailgate to leave at halftime , perhaps adding to the incidence of drunk driving . // Overall , despite the laxers ? " reputation for some drunken , boorish behavior , " Donna Lisker , director of Duke ? s Women ? s Center , told Sports Illustrated , " fraternities are a bigger problem . " Still , administrators and faculty tended to associate the laxers with the worst excesses of Tailgate and of the party scene as whole . // The lacrosse players also symbolized Duke ? s large investment of resources in having nationally competitive Division I athletic teams . This emphasis was rare among the nation ? s the top academic institutions . " We bond over athletics , " explained Seyward Darby , a nonathlete who was editor in chief of The Chronicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride in my university . " The policy also helped Duke attract some quality students who could have gone to Ivy League schools . // But the emphasis on sports gave many Duke professors a sense of shame about their university . Especially those who were still infected with Ivy League envy even after Duke had soared to the fifth ranking for overall quality in the U.S. News &amp; World Report annual college issue . These academics deeply resented what they perceived as Duke ? s bending of admissions standards and use of scholarship funds to build a championship-caliber lacrosse team . That the lacrosse players by and large compiled academic records indistinguishable from a typical group of fifty Duke nonathletes passed without notice from faculty members who resented their status . // Bending admissions and hiring standards and targeting scholarship money to attract more black and Hispanic students and professors was one thing . The Ivies and all other major universities did that , too . And most academics support racial and ethnic diversity ( although not intellectual diversity ) with the fervor of religious believers . // Bending admissions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially since most team members were the kind of prosperous white boys whom many professors considered overrepresented already . // On campus , this position was championed with particular ferocity by cultural anthropology professor Orin Starn , who wanted Duke to drop " to Division III in the longer term or even just have club sports teams . Students could just as well learn the lessons of leadership , competition , and teamwork competing at the Division III or club level . " Money now spent on athletics could then be transferred to " deserving African-American and other applicants from underrepresented groups to strengthen Duke diversity and excellence . " Leaving aside the probable unconstitutionality of race-based scholarships under recent Supreme Court precedents , neither Starn nor any of his faculty supporters ever supplied evidence that funding for athletics had taken away from Duke offering academic merit scholarships . // Other professors , meanwhile , objected to the idea of athletics  --  especially male athletics  --  altogether . They saw sports as reinforcing ideas such as competitiveness and merit-based success that are out of favor in the contemporary academy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonable displacement for the cultures of moral conduct , ethical citizenship and personal integrity , " wrote Karla F. C. Holloway , a professor of English who would emerge as a vehement critic of the lacrosse players , in the journal Scholar and Feminist Online . Such attitudes , she hyperbolically claimed , reinforced " exactly those behaviors of entitlement which have been and can be so abusive to women and girls and those ? othered ? by their sports ? history of membership . " Holloway cited no evidence for any of these crude , contempt-filled stereotypes of athletes . // Many professors and some students also harbored deep resentment of the affluent social class into which a majority of the lacrosse players were born . More than half of the players came from rich or near-rich families and had gone to northeastern prep schools where lacrosse is big . Many planned to make big bucks in fields like investment banking . Assisted by the influential lacrosse network , eight of the ten seniors on the 2005-2006 team planned to begin careers on Wall Street after graduating . Pressler put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents of recruits , pointing out that his players had great success after graduation. // These tensions reflected two tranformations of Duke ? s culture over the previous two decades that put athletes  --  and many other students  --  on a collision course with thier increasingly radical professors . First , Duke joined schools such as Stanford , the University of Texas , and the University of Michigan as a perennial contender for the Sears Cup , awarded for the cumulative performance of all of a school ? s NCAA sports teams . Like Stanford , Duke wrote off football and focused instead on men ? s and women ? s basketball along with sports perceived as bastions of the upper class  --  such as golf , tennis , and lacrosse . To attract better athletes , the institution spent more on sports and athletics facilities . The number of student athletes on financial aid increased from 194 in 1984 to 308 in 2001 . And the Athletics Department as a whole , led by men ? s basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski , became more autonomous after Coach K forced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ athletics director . // At the same time , more important , Duke sought to join the Ivies , Stanford , and MIT among the nation ? s leading academic institutions . It chose to do so , however , on the cheap : bypassing the sciences ( where the combination of salary and lab costs for a new hire ran around $400,000 ) , the school focused on bringing in big-name humanities professors , for whom the only start-up cost was salary . Politically correct leftist professors were in vogue nationwide , and the leftward slant of Duke ? s humanities and social sciences faculty accelerated in 1995 , when President Nannerl Overholser " Nan " Keohane named History professor William Chafe as her new dean of faculty . As he explained in a 2002 " State of Arts and Sciences Address , " Chafe focused on using new faculty hires to eliminate the " tendency to think of Duke as a place of wealth , whiteness and privilege . " Diversity , rather than traditional conceptions of academic excellence , would be the prime criterion in choosing new professors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E. Roy Weintraub pointed out the obvious flaw in this approach , which abandoned " the development of an ever-more distinguished faculty . " " Have we , " Weintraub wondered , " chosen to settle for using our resources to achieve a more diverse faculty instead of a more intellectually distinguished one ? The record of the past decade seems to indicate that the answer is ? yes. ? " In this , as we , shall see , Duke was hardly alone . // In a 2007 blog posting , former Duke professor Stuart Rojstaczer accurately described Duke ? s two-track path to excellence as a looming train wreck . " The humanities , " he wrote , " are dominated by far left politics and many of these star faculty members were very much on the political left . Duke had never had this level of leftist slant before . . . . Many could care less about college athletics and some were openly dismissive . They were different . They tended to be urban . They tended to be Eastern . They tended to fit into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an oasis for them . " Coupled with Chafe ? s emphasis on far-left diversity hires , by early 2006 Duke ? s faculty had grown well out of step with mainstream student opinion . // Meanwhile , the men ? s lacrosse team was seen as symbolic of a way of life despised by many left-leaning Duke professors and administrators and a much smaller group of students . This resentment was fed by the preexisting stereotype  --  up and down the East Coast  --  of lacrosse players as a privileged , conceited , drunken , boorish , even thuggish mix of rich-kid entitlement and big-jock swagger. // This stereotype was to pervade the media coverage once gang-rape charges placed the Duke team in the spotlight . Explained Newsweek : " Strutting lacrosse players are a distinctive and familiar breed on elite campuses along the Eastern Seaboard . Because the game until recently was played mostly at prep schools and in the upper-middle-class communities on New York ? s Long Island and outside Baltimore , the players tend to be at once macho and entitled , a sometimes unfortunate combination . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they " sometimes behave like thugs . " // Among those who read such stuff with mounting disgust was Stefanie Williams , who went to high school with three of the Duke players in Long Island and managed the University of Maryland men ? s lacrosse team . " I watched kids I grew up with get labeled racists , misogynists , white supremacists and hooligans , " she later wrote in The Diamondback , Maryland ? s student newspaper . " I defended the guys on our team who had often walked me home from a bar , let me crash on their couch , hung out with me on away trips , picked me up when I needed rides , grabbed lunch with me , helped me in my classes and stuck up for me when other guys got too rowdy . . . . While . . . race-baiting journalists continuously commented on the ? white culture ? behind lacrosse , no one seemed to mention the hours of community service that ? culture ? encouraged teams to give back . " // Whatever validity the lacrosse-thug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleges , in some years , the 2005  --  2006 Duke team was branded with it by dozens of journalists and thousands of others who had never met a Duke lacrosse player . People who properly shunned racial and gender stereotypes had no hesitation asserting that the Duke team had it coming because lacrosse players were a bad bunch , and probably racists to boot . // That ? s not how they seemed to Devon Sherwood . " I received nothing but love and appreciation and thoughtfulness from my teammates , " he reflected after the tumultuous 2005-2006 academic year had passed . " People were looking out for me . They never treated me differently from the all-Americans , Matt Zash and Matt Danowski . I felt more accepted by this team than ever before in my lacrosse career . It was like a big family . " // The lacrosse players were also like family to Sue Pressler , Mike ? s wife . She helped recruit them . They played with the Presslers ? two girls , fourteen-year-old Janet Lynn and eight-year-old Maggie . And she shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , productive lives . " This class of 2006 seniors , they were always special , " Sue later reflected . " They were cohesive . There was something magical about this group . I had knee surgery when they were freshmen , and along with the flowers the team sent me , the freshmen sent their own flowers . I thought , ? My gosh , I love these kids. ? " // A more mixed but on balance highly positive verdict came from a seven-member faculty committee that investigated the culture of the lacrosse team and Coach Pressler ? s leadership from 2001 to the spring of 2006 . The gist : Even more than most Duke students and athletes , lacrosse players drank much too much . They were much too loud when drunk . Those living and partying off campus often disturbed the neighbors . They were often cited by Durham police for noise and open-container violations . And those shy of twenty-one often got caught drinking illegally . // But apart from the disputed rape charge , the lacrosse players ? infractions , though numerous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in no serious misconduct . They had no record of racism , sexism , violence , or bullying . They studied hard . They got good grades , among the best of any Duke athletic squad , and better than any other lacrosse team in the Atlantic Coast Conference . Every member of the Class of 2006 graduated with a grade point average above 3.0 . They enrolled in the same kinds of classes as most other Duke students . Of the seniors , two majored in economics , two in engineering , one in public policy , and five in history . Five of the squad ? s ten seniors made the honor roll in each of their four years at Duke : captains Dave Evans , Matt Zash , and Bret Thompson , and Erik Henkelman and Glenn Nick . The team ? s graduation rate was 100 percent . // Because many lacrosse players planned careers in business , banking , and consulting , they often supplemented their academic majors with a seven-course " markets and management " cluster . Given their career aims and the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common for several players to enroll in the same class . Such situations often foster academic-integrity problems , as when fraternity brothers or sorority sisters " share " papers from previous years . But the 2006 Duke lacrosse team ? s academic-integrity record was impeccable . // The team also had a good record of community service , especially with a reading program that targeted black and Hispanic children in the Durham public schools . They showed respect and consideration for the people who did menial jobs for the team , minorities , and women . And even more than past Duke teams , the 2005-2006 team had formed a tight bond with the women ? s lacrosse team . The two teams practiced side by side . // When the legal case against the players collapsed , defenders of the rush to judgment would fall back on the new mantra that the Duke lacrosse players were " no choirboys " or " no angels . " The implication seemed to be that traits shared by the vast majority of college students nationwide could justify the selective public trashing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and many Duke professors and administrators . // Some Duke administrators and others continued to float innuendos , despite the evidence , suggesting that members of the 2005-2006 lacrosse team had been involved in boorish or even thuggish conduct that the committee had somehow missed . But when pressed for examples , these detractors had little to offer . Two Duke grads did cite a case in which lacrosse players broke up a party at a local restaurant by getting into a brawl , with people smashing beer bottles on each other ? s heads . " I remember seeing a guy who I somehow knew to be a lacrosse player , on top of someone else , pounding them with his fist , " one grad recalled . But that occurred in the spring of 1997 , years before any member of the 2005-2006 team had arrived at Duke . // More recent data from Duke ? s Judicial Affairs Office are telling : In the six academic years ending in 2006 , there were a total of 377 reported incidents of academic dishonesty ( such as cheating and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical abuse , fighting and endangerment ; 20 incidents of alleged sexual misconduct ; 171 alcohol-related medical calls ; and 96 incidents of drug-related misconduct . None of these involved lacrosse players , excepting one accused of smoking pot in his room in 2001. // Not that all was idyllic . Not all the younger players always loved all the seniors , any more than kids always love older siblings . There were tensions inherent in the need for the seniors to step up to leadership roles , the arrival of a new group of freshmen , the competition for scarce playing time , the annual ritual of any team that Sue Pressler called " herding to get everyone on the same page to achieve the goal . " And while both men ? s and women ? s teams were loaded with talent and were contenders for national championships , the high expectations brought pressure . " The spirit for both teams at times seemed forced , trying to find a new identity from the previous year ? s team , " reflected an assistant coach for the women ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that identity as their season went on . " The boys ? team never got the chance . // As the season began in February 2006 , they dreamed of winning the national championship that had barely eluded Duke the previous spring . " Duke is loaded this year , " the 2006 Yearbook edition of Face-Off reported . " Just about everybody ? s back and the Blue Devils are ready to run and gun their way back for another crack at the title . " Then senior Casey Carroll , one of the best defenseman in the country , tore his ACL during practice on March 6 . He was out for the season . " That was devastating , just devastating , " Sue Pressler recalled later . It was not the same team without Casey . They struggled to beat Loyola of Baltimore on March 12 , in San Diego . After the game the team had a ceremony to give Casey the game ball . But a game ball was no compensation for an end to his college lacrosse career . // " It ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sue Pressler explained . A tall , athletic woman who was captain of the swimming team at the University of Michigan , a swimming coach at Ohio Wesleyan University , and a tenured faculty member in Physical Education , teaching Exercise Physiology and Kinesiology , Sue understood the passion of young athletes for their sport . " These lacrosse players are some of the most elite student athletes in the country , " she explained , at a time when they were being reviled as the shame of the country . " These kids are driven . They have a passion for their sport . They have a passion for the classroom  --  okay , a few not as much , but many do . They do things that you can ? t teach . It ? s beautiful , and part of it is that they would die for each other . I understand ? work hard , play hard. ? Did they ever let the door slam in your face ? I doubt it . They were everything you ? d want your kid to be  --  polite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task . " // Casey Carroll had one chance of coming back the next year and finishing out his Duke lacrosse career . If they made it to the finals of the national championship , as it happened , they would have played enough games for him to qualify under the arcane rules for such matters . All his teammates would have to do for him to qualify would be to run the table against all of the best lacrosse teams in the country .
