CELL ONE <br> The first time our house was robbed , it was our neighbor Osita who climbed in through the dining room window and stole our TV , our VCR , and the Purple Rain and Thriller videotapes my father had brought back from America . The second time our house was robbed , it was my brother Nnamabia who faked a break-in and stole my mother 's jewelry . It happened on a Sunday . My parents had traveled to our hometown , Mbaise , to visit our grandparents , so Nnamabia and I went to church alone . He drove my mother 's green Peugeot 504 . We sat together in church as we usually did , but we did not nudge each other and stifle giggles about somebody 's ugly hat or threadbare caftan , because Nnamabia left without a word after about ten minutes . He came back just before the priest said , " The Mass is ended . Go in peace . " I was a little piqued . I imagined he had gone off to smoke and to see some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , but he could at least have told me where he was going . We drove home in silence and , when he parked in our long driveway , I stopped to pluck some ixora flowers while Nnamabia unlocked the front door . I went inside to find him standing still in the middle of the parlor . <br> " We 've been robbed ! " he said in English . <br> It took me a moment to understand , to take in the scattered room . Even then , I felt that there was a theatrical quality to the way the drawers were flung open , as if it had been done by somebody who wanted to make an impression on the discoverers . Or perhaps it was simply that I knew my brother so well . Later , when my parents came home and neighbors began to troop in to say ndo , and to snap their fingers and heave their shoulders up and down , I sat alone in my room upstairs and realized what the queasiness in my gut was : Nnamabia had done it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed out that the window louvers had been slipped out from the inside , rather than outside ( Nnamabia was really much smarter than that ; perhaps he had been in a hurry to get back to church before Mass ended ) , and that the robber knew exactly where my mother 's jewelry was  --  the left corner of her metal trunk . Nnamabia stared at my father with dramatic , wounded eyes and said , " I know I have caused you both terrible pain in the past , but I would never violate your trust like this . " He spoke English , using unnecessary words like " terrible pain " and " violate , " as he always did when he was defending himself . Then he walked out through the back door and did not come home that night . Or the next night . Or the night after . He came home two weeks later , gaunt , smelling of beer , crying , saying he was sorry and he had pawned the jewelry to the Hausa traders in Enugu and all the money was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my gold ? " my mother asked him . And when he told her , she placed both hands on her head and cried , " Oh ! Oh ! Chi m egbuo m ! My God has killed me ! " It was as if she felt that the least he could have done was get a good price . I wanted to slap her . My father asked Nnamabia to write a report : how he had sold the jewelry , what he had spent the money on , with whom he had spent it . I did n't think Nnamabia would tell the truth , and I do n't think my father thought he would , either , but he liked reports , my professor father , he liked things written down and nicely documented . Besides , Nnamabia was seventeen , with a carefully tended beard . He was in that space between secondary school and university and was too old for caning . What else could my father have done ? After Nnamabia wrote the report , my father filed it in the steel drawer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> " That he could hurt his mother like this " was the last thing my father said , in a mutter . <br> But Nnamabia really had n't set out to hurt her . He did it because my mother 's jewelry was the only thing of any value in the house : a lifetime 's collection of solid gold pieces . He did it , too , because other sons of professors were doing it . This was the season of thefts on our serene Nsukka campus . Boys who had grown up watching Sesame Street , reading Enid Blyton , eating cornflakes for breakfast , attending the university staff primary school in smartly polished brown sandals , were now cutting through the mosquito netting of their neighbors ' windows , sliding out glass louvers , and climbing in to steal TVs and VCRs . We knew the thieves . Nsukka campus was such a small place  --  the houses sitting side by side on tree-lined streets , separated only by low hedges  --  that we could not but know who was stealing . Still , when their professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church or at a faculty meeting , they continued to moan about riffraff from town coming onto their sacred campus to steal . <br> The thieving boys were the popular ones . They drove their parents ' cars in the evening , their seats pushed back and their arms stretched out to reach the steering wheel . Osita , the neighbor who had stolen our TV only weeks before the Nnamabia incident , was lithe and handsome in a brooding sort of way and walked with the grace of a cat . His shirts were always sharply ironed ; I used to look across the hedge and see him and close my eyes and imagine that he was walking toward me , coming to claim me as his . He never noticed me . When he stole from us , my parents did not go over to Professor Ebube 's house to ask him to ask his son to bring back our things . They said publicly that it was riffraff from town . But they knew it was Osita . Osita was two years older than Nnamabia ; most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perhaps that was why Nnamabia did not steal from another person 's house . Perhaps he did not feel old enough , qualified enough , for anything bigger than my mother 's jewelry . <br> Nnamabia looked just like my mother , with that honey-fair complexion , large eyes , and a generous mouth that curved perfectly . When my mother took us to the market , traders would call out , " Hey ! Madam , why did you waste your fair skin on a boy and leave the girl so dark ? What is a boy doing with all this beauty ? " And my mother would chuckle , as though she took a mischievous and joyful responsibility for Nnamabia 's good looks . When , at eleven , Nnamabia broke the window of his classroom with a stone , my mother gave him the money to replace it and did not tell my father . When he lost some library books in class two , she told his form-mistress that our houseboy had stolen them . When , in class three , he left early every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went and so could not receive Holy Communion , she told the other parents that he had malaria on the examination day . When he took the key of my father 's car and pressed it into a piece of soap that my father found before Nnamabia could take it to a locksmith , she made vague sounds about how he was just experimenting and it ? did n't mean a thing . When he stole the exam questions from the study and sold them to my father 's students , she shouted at him but then told my father that Nnamabia was sixteen , after all , and really should be given more pocket money . <br> I do n't know whether Nnamabia felt remorse for stealing her jewelry . I could not always tell from my brother 's gracious , smiling face what it was he really felt . And we did not talk about it . Even though my mother 's sisters sent her their gold earrings , even though she bought an earring-and-pendant set from Mrs. Mozie , the glamorous woman who imported gold from Italy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month to pay for it in installments , we never talked , after that day , about Nnamabia 's stealing her jewelry . It was as if pretending that Nnamabia had not done the things he had done would give him the opportunity to start afresh . The robbery might never have been mentioned again if Nnamabia had not been arrested three years later , in his third year in the university , and locked up at the police station . <br> It was the season of cults on our serene Nsukka campus . It was the time when signboards all over the university read , in bold letters , SAY NO TO CULTS . The Black Axe , the Buccaneers , and the Pirates were the best known . They may once have been benign fraternities , but they had evolved and were now called " cults " ; eighteen-year-olds who had mastered the swagger of American rap videos were undergoing secret and strange initiations that sometimes left one or two of them dead on Odim Hill . Guns and tortured loyalties and axes had become common . Cult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl who turned out to be the girlfriend of the Capone of the Black Axe , and that boy , as he walked to a kiosk to buy a cigarette later , would be stabbed in the thigh , and he would turn out to be a member of the Buccaneers , and so his fellow Buccaneers would go to a beer parlor and shoot the nearest Black Axe boy in the shoulder , and then the next day a Buccaneer member would be shot dead in the refectory , his body falling against aluminum bowls of soup , and that evening a Black Axe boy would be hacked to death in his room in a lecturer 's Boys ' Quarters , his CD player splattered with blood . It was senseless . It was so abnormal that it quickly became normal . Girls stayed inside their hostel rooms after lectures and lecturers quivered and when a fly buzzed too loudly ; people were afraid . So the police were called in . They sped across campus in their rickety blue Peugeot 505 , rusty guns poking out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came home from his lectures laughing . He thought the police would have to do better ; everyone knew the cult boys had more modern guns . <br> Continues ...
