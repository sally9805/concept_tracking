Ways to make use of this overlooked space Photographs by Steven Gunther Photograph Against the house wall are a shower and an equipment-storage closet , as well as an outdoor sink ( bottom right ) . The gate elevates a potted plant . // Pity the poor side yard . It 's one of the most visible and frequented parts of the landscape . Yet we often treat it like a dog run at a kennel-all paving , no plants . Narrow as these spaces may be , it 's possible to turn them into real gardens , or to use them for extra living space . Two side yards , pictured on these pages , offer proof . Utility with charm Robyn and Dana Hogan and their teenage son Chad have messy hobbiesscuba diving , boogie boarding , and spearfishing . That means wetsuits need to be rinsed off and gear stored away . And very big fish-halibut and sea-bass-need cleaning . Such tasks are better done outdoors whenever possible , so the Hogans decided to install stations to handle these chores in the side yard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow corridor is visible from indoors , Robyn also wanted it to look pretty when it is n't in use . Capistrano Beach landscape architect Theresa Clark managed to fit in an outdoor closet for scuba and fishing gear , a shower to use before and after water sports , and a sink for cleaning fish . ( Robyn found the antique limestone sink in France . ) " I also use the sink as a prep station when I 'm working with cut flowers , " says Robyn . " All the mess stays outside . " There 's a dog door to the space just big enough for the Hogans ' pair of tiny papillons , Roxy and Lucy . A trellis covered with a white-flowered potato vine ( Solanum jasminoides ) creates a picturesque focal point that draws attention away from the neighbor 's house . Garden bench , urns , and antique door trim are final proof that no space is too small to be lovely .

Despite the fact that the space measures just 6 feet wide and is in shade much of the day , the best option seemed to be a pretty garden viewed from inside the house . " We did n't want our only view to be of our neighbor 's gray wall , " Karen says . To create pleasant views , Huntington Beach garden designers Sandy Atherton and Sherry Lewis planted tall , narrow , fast-growing shrubs-including camellias and Podocarpus gracilior-in front of the neighbor 's wall ( at right above ) . For a dash of color in a sunnier spot near the front , they added clematis vines . They left wide strips between large ( 2- by 2 1/2-foot ) slabs of Arizona flagstone for planting , and filled the spaces with giant ajuga and Lamium maculatum ' White Nancy ' . Autumn ferns , begonias , and Loropetalum chinense ' Razzleberri ' spill out into the pathway from beds beside the path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we relied on the texture and color of foliage instead of blooms , " says Lewis . " And as a result , the garden looks great year-round . " Sidebar Small-space strategies * Create an espalier . Training a plant to grow flat against a wall or fence is a great way to soften a narrow space . A wide variety of flowering shrubs and fruit trees lend themselves to this treatment . For sunny spots , consider citrus , ' Climbing Cecile Brunner ' rose , Cotoneaster lacteus , crabapple , edible fig , mirror plant ( Coprosma repens ) , and pyracantha . Camellia , goldenchain tree ( Laburnum watereri ) , Texas mountain laurel ( Sophora secundiflora ) , and vine maple ( Acer circinatum ) are good in part shade . For support , tie the plant 's branches to a lath trellis or to a system of wires attached to the wall . * Attach planters to walls . Flat-backed terra-cotta or stone containers can dress up walls outside windows . Or place flower boxes atop block walls and fill them with plants that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also block out views from neighboring windows , providing more privacy . * Grow vines overhead . For added privacy , install an elevated , horizontal trellis and train vines across it , creating a green roof over your side yard . Hang art . Use the wall between your house and your neighbor 's as an art gallery . Mount a stone basrelief , a copper sun god , or a wrought-iron gate or other piece of found art . // <p>
