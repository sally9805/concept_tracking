8 moves to keep , 8 to ditch <p> Thirty-six-year-old Laura Metcalf has been doing ab work for 15 years . " I do countless crunches at the gym , " says the active mom , who lives in Indianapolis . " But when a trainer recommended I try a full sit-up , I could n't believe how hard it was to do just one , " says Metcalf , who now vows to do a few sit-ups instead of dozens of crunches . <p> Believe it or not , she 'll see better , faster results if she does . In fact , a lot of the moves you see  --  and maybe do  --  every day in the gym are n't the best way to strengthen your muscles , says former Olympic coach and Ormond Beach , FL , strength-training consultant Harvey Newton . " There 's a lot of ' bodybuilding pollution ' out there , " he says . Bodybuilders devise moves to hit every muscle fiber from every angle . Now many of those exercises have become mainstream . <p> Not only does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never get the shape she wants by isolating each and every muscle , " says Patrick Hagerman , EdD , a professor of exercise science at the University of Tulsa . The better bet : Hit a broad range of muscles at once . <p> With that in mind , we asked experts to name their eight top strength-training time wasters . Look familiar ? We thought so . Swap them for our choices , and you 'll save time while you get firm faster , <p> DITCH Ab Crunch That 's right . " This quintessential abdominal move might as well be dubbed ' the great time waster , ' " says Hagerman . Originally designed to isolate the abdominal muscles , the crunch is best for beginners or people recovering from back pain . Because the range of motion in a crunch is so limited  --  and abs get strong fast  --  people can end up doing dozens of crunches without seeing any real progress , he says . <p> DO Sit-Up Lie on back with feet resting flat on floor , knees bent about 90 degrees , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract abdominals , and roll all the way up , bringing chest as close to knees as possible . Roll back down . Start with 10 to 15 sit-ups . <p> <p> Why it works " Sit-ups involve a greater range of motion , so your abs work longer under tension , " says Hagerman . Sit-ups also work your hip flexors ( the muscles at the front of your hips ) , which help maintain proper posture and are often weak from disuse . <p> DITCH Dumbbell Fly Hailed as a cleavage creator , this popular chest exercise isolates just a small part of the pectoral muscle , says Hagerman . " It 's not functional for anything but giving a better bear hug , " he says . And less-than-perfect form can strain the shoulder joints . <p> DO Stair Push-Up Place hands , under shoulders , on a step with arms extended . Walk feet back until body forms straight line from head to heels . Bend elbows and slowly lower chest to step until shoulders are in line with elbows . Press back to starting position and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too challenging , start at a higher step or use an aerobic bench . ) <p> <p> Why it works " Push-ups are one of the best upper body toners because they recruit muscles in your chest , triceps , and shoulders , " says Hagerman . But many women avoid them because they 're too difficult . By performing them on an incline , you lessen the force of gravity slightly , so you can complete more reps and give your torso a total workout . <p> DITCH Seated Leg Extension Whether done on a machine or with ankle weights , this move will help shape your quadriceps . But leg extensions can place dangerous loads on the ligaments and tendons in your knees , says Hagerman . Women 's knees are notoriously fragile : The NCAA tracked knee injuries in college athletes and found women suffered two to four times as many ligament tears as men . <p> DO Planted Step-Up Hold an 8- to 10-pound dumbbell in each hand and stand facing a step . Step up with left leg . Straighten left leg ; at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leg behind you . Bring right leg back down , and lower your body until tip of right toe just touches floor , keeping left foot on step . Immediately repeat , completing a full set ( 10 to 15 reps ) with one leg . Then switch sides . ( For added challenge , make the step higher or step onto a bench . ) <p> <p> Why it works It 's safer , plus your quads you lift your body It also tones your butt , hamstrings and calves . If you prefer machines , try the One-Legged Press . <p> DITCH Side Knee Crunch For years , love-handle loathers have been trying to isolate their obliques ( side torso muscles ) by dropping their knees to the side during ab crunches . In reality , this move puts excess pressure on the fluid-filled disks in your spine while leaving your obliques largely untouched , says Hagerman . " The risks far outweigh the benefits on this one . " <p> DO Straight-Arm Crisscross Lie faceup on floor with knees bent and aligned over hips , and calves raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in each hand , arms extended so towel is stretched over knees . Roll head and shoulder blades up off floor while extending left leg to about 45 degrees from floor and moving towel to outside of right knee . Then extend right leg and bend left knee , moving towel to outside of left knee , keeping shoulders lifted . Continue alternating without dropping torso . Do 10 to 15 reps . <p> <p> Why it works Your obliques are responsible for twisting your torso , so they 're challenged throughout the move . Your abs get a full workout , too  --  without any risky spinal compression . <p> DITCH Upright Row This is another move that was designed to build vanity muscles but ultimately may create more strain than shape . " Standing straight up and pulling weights along your body is awkward and unnatural , " says Newton . Lifting too high can also painfully impinge the shoulder and cause wrist pain . <p> DO Forward-Leaning Lateral Raise Sit on bench with feet together , a 3- to 5-pound weight in each hand . Lean forward at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hang down next to calves , palms facing each other . Squeeze shoulder blades together . Raise arms to sides in an arcing motion until they 're parallel to floor . Pause and then slowly return to starting position . Do 10 to 15 reps . <p> <p> Why it works This move targets the rear shoulder muscles more effectively than the upright row , says Newton . It also targets the often-overlooked rhomboid muscles , which hold shoulders back to help you easily maintain good posture . <p> DITCH Heel Raise Though this move may be useful for walkers prone to shin splints , if you 're doing it for aesthetics , " it 's useless , " says Newton . " The shape of your calves may be largely genetic . " <p> DO Walk on an Incline Find a hill or set the treadmill on an incline and walk for 30 minutes , suggests Newton . ( Your calves also get a good workout during squats , lunges , and step-ups . ) <p> <p> Why it works Your calves help propel you forward up hills . Incline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will also strengthen your heart and burn many more calories than just doing heel raises would . <p> DITCH Side Bend Another supposed love-handle eliminator , this old-school move can actually make your waist look bigger as it unnaturally builds the obliques . " I 'm shocked how many people still do these , " says Prevention advisor Kara Gallagher , PhD , an assistant professor of exercise physiology at the University of Louisville . " The obliques are n't designed to lift in that up-and-down motion . " <p> DO T-Pose Assume full push-up position , with arms extended so body forms straight line from head to heels . Tighten abs and roll body to right side , supporting torso with right arm . Extend left arm straight up , so body forms a sideways T. Hold 5 seconds then switch sides . If balance is a problem , perform the move on your forearm instead of with your arm extended . Repeat 5 to 8 times . <p> <p> Why it works Your obliques are fully engaged to brace your entire torso during this popular core-strengthening move . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This move targets your whole upper body and prevents back pain , " says Gallagher . <p> DITCH Seated Adduction This machine was specially designed to fight inner-thigh flab . Although it does work the adductors ( inner-thigh muscles ) , it 's not the most effective way to target them , says Hagerman . " When you sit on that machine and squeeze in your legs , you 're mostly targeting deep hip rotators you never see , " he says . <p> DO One-Legged Press Sit in leg press machine . Position feet hip- to shoulder-width apart , with legs at 90-degree angles ( adjust seat if necessary ) . Remove left foot from platform and place it on floor , leaving right foot where it is . Hold side handlebars and press lower back to pad . Slowly push platform away and extend right leg without locking knee , then slowly lower the weight . Complete a full set ( 10 to 15 reps ) , then switch legs . <p> <p> Why it works " During a single-leg press , your inner thighs work to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Hagerman . This move also shapes your quads , glutes , and hamstrings , so you get more total toning for your time . Cardio time wasters <p> The weight room is n't the only place you might be wasting precious exercise time . Sloppy form and other common mistakes can dramatically lessen the effectiveness of your aerobic workouts as well , says Prevention advisor Wayne Westcott , PhD . He recommends avoiding these three errors . <p> <p> The Machine Lean If you support yourself on the handles while working out on the StairMaster or elliptical trainer , you can cut your calorie burn by 20% . Our quick fix : Ditch the magazine and jam to music instead . " When you 're trying to read a magazine on the console , you almost need to lean forward and hold your torso steady , " says Westcott . <p> <p> The Single-Speed Wonder Too many people churn out their entire workout on the same setting . After just a few months , your body adapts and starts burning fewer calories . " For one or two workouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whether you 're on the treadmill or at the pool , " doing 30-second bursts of speed will boost your fitness . " <p> <p> The One-Trick Pony Even if you 're addicted to the treadmill , give it a day off and try something different  --  at least once a week , he says . " Cross training challenges different muscles in a variety of ways , which keeps your body adapting and burning fuel even when you 're not working out .
