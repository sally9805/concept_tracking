Wolfcry By Amelia Atwater-Rhodes Random House Amelia Atwater-Rhodes The northern hills of Wyvern 's Court were filled with the trills of tiny bells , the lilting words of storytellers and the songs of choruses . Enraptured children sat in front of me , waiting for me to begin the story of the first avian queen . Blatantly out of place among them was a friend of mine , a serpiente dancer named Urban , who was lounging near the back , managing to look bored and nervous at the same time . " Many , many years ago , our ancestors were a collection of small tribes , each led by a different captain and each squabbling with its neighbors over food , water and shelter . When drought caused famine , they became afraid and so were more protective of their scarce belongings . " In the middle of the worst winter , when early snows had destroyed too many of the crops , a woman named Aleya gave birth to a daughter . She loved her child , but she knew she could never take care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the mountains and left her there , praying that the wild spirits would care for her . " The infant began to cry , and soon a pair bond of hawks landed beside her . They cared for the child as one of their own , teaching her the language of the forest and giving her their most precious gift : the skies . They gave the girl some of their magic and taught her how to change from her human form into that of a golden hawk . " I paused there , looking into the wide eyes of myyoung audience . One of the children had moved closer to Urban and was trying to examine the silk scarf he had tied around his waist-a melos , one of the accessories worn by professional serpiente dancers . Urban glanced at her and she jumped . " But there comes a time when every chick must leave its nest , and as she grew older , the hawk-girl began to wonder about her true mother . Finally , when she was thirteen , she returned to her homeland . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never known , but was horrified by the conditions in which they lived , by the fear and anger that seemed ever present among humans . " The girl led first her family and then the rest of her mother 's tribe into the woods and taught them how to reach the skies . She showed them better ways to hunt , with a hawk 's vision and talons , and so they became healthy and well fed once again . " Later , other tribes joined them , and each took a form from the wilderness-ravens , crows and then sparrows . For the first time , these tribes lived peacefully together , led by the young queen they named Alasdair , which means protector . " The children clapped happily , making the bells hanging from their wrists jingle . I smiled , enjoying the story almost as much as I had during my first Festival-until one of the adults who had been nearby noticed her child reaching for Urban 's melos again and darted forward to scoop her up and away from Urban . Urban pretended not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had told the story of Alasdair the way my mother had used to tell it to me , but I knew that some of these children had learned a darker ending from their parents . Just twenty years before , the myth always would have included the death of Alasdair at the hands of the serpiente . Tales such as these fueled avians ' hatred from the cradle . I tried not to let the avian mother 's reaction to Urban ruin my mood . I knew that many people did not approve of his presence there ; Urban was not just a serpent-an apprentice dancer , at that-he was widely known to be my foremost suitor among the serpiente . As such , he faced the wrath of mothers with eligible sons , and of course the jealousy of avian men our age , in addition to the general prejudice of avians against serpiente . Still , I was glad he had come . Suitor or not , Urban was one of my closest friends . We had grown up together . It meant a lot to me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the avians might react . " Bit of a dull story , " Urban remarked as he came to my side , trying to keep a careful distance between himself and the avians around us . " Lacks intrigue , danger , scandal . " " Well , I 'm sorry that the way my ancestor saved her people from starvation and war is n't racy enough for you , " I said , teasing . Serpiente history-which , unlike the avian stories , was regarded as fact , not myth-involved the brave leader of a clan known as the Dasi seducing a powerful creature called Leben , who had impersonated one of their gods to demand their worship . The story , which was told each year in the dance named after the winter solstice holiday Namir-da , described how Leben had given all of Maeve 's people second forms to try to win her favor . Maeve had been given the form of a white viper . Kiesha , the high priestess of Anhamirak , had been given the form of a king cobra . Seven others had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the god Ahnmik , had been given falcon forms . The Namir-da did not tell the falcons ' story . It also did not include the part about the Dasi being torn apart by a vicious civil war shortly after the gifts had been given . Maeve and the four falcons had been exiled on charges of black magic . The white vipers still lived on the fringes of our society even in modern day , while Cjarsa , Araceli , Syfka and Servos made up the royal house of the falcon empire . Kiesha 's people became the serpiente ; my family were her descendents . " Unfortunately , " Urban continued , his tone making clear that he found nothing unfortunate in it , " I need to run to the nest now . I 'm hoping to catch Salem before he is surrounded by people . " Only the full members of the dancer 's nest had been invited to Salem 's initiation ceremony , and though Urban had grown up in the nest , he had not yet taken his vows . However , the reception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend , including apprentices and wyverns . " You will be there later , right ? " " Of course . I think my parents have already headed over .
