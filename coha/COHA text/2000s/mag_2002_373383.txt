On a Thursday in March 1776 , James Boswell and Samuel Johnson whizzed through the English countryside in a post chaise at 10 m.p.h . Dr. Johnson said contentedly , " Life has not many things better than this . " Transportation has been deteriorating ever since . <P> That ca n't be measured exactly . Travel is , in some crucial way , a subjective emotional experience . The delighted Dr. Johnson 's carriage jounced along down urban corridors of dust or mud . But the rig was , for its time , a Rolls-Royce . Travel is literally a state of mind . When trains got started in the early 19th century , people thought that moving 20 m.p.h. might cause insanity . On the other hand , it is not speed but an enraging motionlessness  --  the stalled freeway , or the runway where you sit for an hour or two awaiting takeoff  --  that causes derangement today . We are spoiled . It has been a while since we sat back in a plane or a car and told ourselves , " Life has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objective profit and loss have suffered too . Airlines explore the temptations of Chapter 11 . Amtrak staggers ahead , feckless and insolvent , through train wrecks and slowdowns . It is time to make very large changes  --  to rearrange the mix of the three basic modes of mass transportation : air , rail and highway . <P> The answer to the nation 's transportation problems clearly lies neither in an expansion of aviation nor in putting more cars on additional highways . My choice would be the oldest mode of the three : rail . It is not a sentimental or nostalgic choice . The aviation industry , like the vast infrastructure for cars , is dangerously overbuilt . In recent years aviation has sucked regional boosters into ill-conceived drives for more airports and more flights , even short ones  --  all at immense expense . <P> Airplanes are indispensable for long trips over oceans , over a continent or half a continent . But air travel makes no sense over short distances . In any case , the evolution of cell phones and e-mail and the Internet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not more . When ideas and images fly so magically , then our clumsy , inconvenient bodies need not do so  --  or not so much . <P> Would it be possible for the U.S. , with its great distances , to divide and organize itself for rail ? To reinvent its railroads in order to make them fast , efficient and attractive in regional systems , aiming for a European scale and speed and coherence in each region ? ( For example : Sacramento-San Francisco-Los Angeles-San Diego ; **58;14989;TOOLONG ; Boston-New **38;15049;TOOLONG ; and so on ) . Yes . <P> Critics of expanding the American rail system make three key arguments : 1 ) Amtrak is hopeless ; 2 ) building a viable rail system  --  upgrading old roadbeds and laying new track , clearing new right of way , buying new equipment  --  could cost as much as $100 billion ; and 3 ) it would be irresponsible for government to pour so much money into a service that the market has shown it will not support . People do n't ride the trains as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are dying .
