<p> TAXES should n't be your first consideration when you 're pondering a new investment . But financial advisers say you should n't give tax planning the cold shoulder , either . <p> " I tell clients to think of the tax code as their friend , " said Gary Schatsky , a financial planner in New York . <p> Mr. Schatsky acknowledges that this is n't how most people view the world . But he said that investors would benefit from careful decisions about which assets to hold in their taxable accounts and which to place in tax-deferred accounts  --  including individual retirement accounts and employer-sponsored 401(k) plans , as well as college savings plans . <p> Rearranging an entire portfolio based on tax issues may not make sense , because the simple act of buying and selling securities may itself result in tax liabilities and trading costs . But financial planners recommend that you keep taxes in mind when investing new money , especially when you are preparing to fund an I.R.A . or another tax-deferred account . <p> Because April 15 falls on a Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make 2006 I.R.A . contributions . Investors under 50 years old can contribute $4,000 to either traditional or Roth I.R.A . ' s for both 2006 and 2007 . As of last year , the contribution limits rose for investors who are at least 50 . Now they can contribute $5,000 to their I.R.A . ' s for both 2006 and 2007 . <p> But once investors sock money away in their I.R.A . ' s , many of them do n't consider the various ways that different investments are taxed , financial planners say . For example , because investors regard their retirement accounts as long-term holdings , they tend to own a lot of stocks in them . But for many holders of traditional I.R.A . ' s , that is often a mistake , Mr. Schatsky said , because when they eventually make withdrawals , they will have to pay taxes at their income tax rate at that time on money earned from capital gains and dividends . <p> In other words , they will have lost out on the lower tax rates for dividends and long-term capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter , with their own advantages and pitfalls . ) <p> Instead , Mr. Schatsky advises putting fixed-income investments that pay interest  --  bonds , certificates of deposit or cash  --  into tax-deferred accounts . Interest payments on these investments are taxed at investors ' income tax rates . <p> Mr. Schatsky also includes real estate investment trusts , or REITs , and preferred stocks in the category of investments that should be owned in tax-deferred accounts . The dividends on REITs are taxed at investors ' income tax rates , because the earnings they distribute to investors have n't been taxed at the corporate level . <p> Some investors may be mistakenly packing their I.R.A . ' s with stocks , based on assumptions made years ago , before taxes were lowered on dividends and capital gains outside of tax-deferred accounts , said Jordan S. Berlin , the chief executive of Weiser Capital Management , the money management subsidiary of Weiser L.L.P. , an accounting and consulting firm in New York . <p> Dividends were taxed at investors ' income tax rates until 2003 , when the taxes on most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That same year , the top tax rate for long-term capital gains was lowered to 15 percent from 20 percent . Before 2003 , many investors preferred to hold dividend-paying stocks in tax-deferred accounts , and Mr. Berlin said that some investors still have n't adjusted their portfolios  --  or their mind-sets . <p> Mr. Berlin agreed with Mr. Schatsky that it was better to hold large-cap stocks that pay dividends in taxable accounts now . But he said that small-cap stocks could go either way , because they do n't usually pay much in the way of dividends  --  if they pay dividends at all . So investors who hold them in traditional I.R.A . ' s wo n't lose much of the benefit of lower dividend tax rates , although they would still lose the advantage of lower rates on long-term capital gains . <p> Mr. Schatsky said that there were other advantages to holding stocks in taxable accounts , especially riskier stocks that might generate huge gains or losses . <p> " If you take a big loss in a tax-sheltered account , you ca n't write it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that stock in a taxable account , you could sell it for a tax loss to offset a big capital gain from another stock you own . <p> On the other hand , if you own a speculative stock that hits the jackpot , there are more options in a taxable account . For example , you can offset part of the capital gains when you sell the stock by also selling a stock that has lost money . Or you can donate the appreciated stock to a charity and avoid paying any capital gains taxes on it , while taking a full income tax deduction on the stock 's current value . Or you can give the stock to someone in a lower tax bracket , like a child or parent . <p> The picture is a bit more complicated with stock mutual funds , because there are great disparities in their tax-friendliness . Generally , financial planners recommend using taxable accounts for holding large-cap index funds that throw off a lot of dividends . But they say that funds in which the managers trade often and generate short-term capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax rates  --  are better in tax-deferred accounts . <p> Buying funds in a tax-deferred account can also help investors avoid paying taxes on money they never made , said David J. Silverman , a New York tax accountant and co-author of the " Taxes for Dummies " books . <p> Investors who buy mutual funds in taxable accounts just before the funds distribute capital gains or dividends will be stuck with a tax bill , even though they did n't own the funds when the money was made . Often , investors wait until after these dividends and gains are distributed before buying the funds . <p> But Mr. Silverman said that investors could avoid this waiting game by buying the funds in tax-deferred accounts . <p> FINALLY , what about Roth I.R.A . ' s ? Financial planners say that they occupy a middle ground . Because you wo n't be paying any taxes when you withdraw the money from them in retirement , you wo n't lose out on the lower tax rates for capital gains and dividends . Along the road to retirement , however , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax-loss selling or donating appreciated stock to charity . <p> Contributions to Roth I.R.A . ' s are not allowed for some high-income taxpayers , although the income limits are rising in 2007 . For example , the amount that individual taxpayers can contribute to a Roth I.R.A . begins phasing out if they earned $95,000 in adjusted gross income in 2006 , and goes to zero if they hit $110,000 . But in 2007 , their contribution limits will begin phasing out at an adjusted gross income of $99,000 , and will be eliminated at $114,000 . <p> Mr. Schatsky said that when a client has all three types of accounts , he recommends putting as many bonds as possible into the traditional I.R.A. , and as many stocks as possible into the taxable account . Then he uses the Roth I.R.A . to reach the appropriate portfolio allocation for that investor 's goals and time horizon , adding stocks or bonds as needed . <p> While tax considerations should be part of the planning process , he said , it is more important to get the overall portfolio allocation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " should n't be the tail that wags the dog .
