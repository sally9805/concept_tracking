Vivi , January 1994 My name is Viviane Abbott Walker . Age sixty-eight , but I can pass for forty-nine . And I do . I altered my driver 's license and kept that gorgeous picture of me when my hair was still thick and I looked like Jessica Lange , and glued it onto every new license I 've had since 1975 . And not one officer has said a word to me about it . I like to think I am Queen of the Ya-Yas , the sisterhood I 've been part of since I was four . But the fact is that all of us are queens . The Ya-Yas are not a monarchy . We are a Ya-Ya-cracy . Caro , who is still more alive than anyone I know , even though she is yoked to an oxygen tank most of the time because of her emphysema . Teensy , who is probably the most sophisticated of us , although she does n't know it , and still cute as a bug . I never know when she 'll be home in Thornton -- right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all raised -- or in Paris or Istanbul . And Necie , our dear , kind Necie , who is still Madame Chairwoman of every charity in the parish , if not the state . As Ya-Yas , we 've grown up , raised our kids -- the Petites Ya-Yas -- and welcomed our grandchildren , the Trs Petites , into this sweet , crazy world . We 've helped one another stay glued together through most any life event you can imagine . Except we have n't buried our husbands yet . Well , Caro tried to bury Blaine when she found out he was gay , but decided he and his boyfriend were too much fun and Blaine too good a cook to kill him . It was the Ya-Yas who brought my oldest child , Sidda , and I back together when we were on the verge of an ugly mother-daughter divorce . They would not stand by and watch it happen , bless their crazy wild hearts . Sidda said it was the three of them and that old scrapbook of mine that I so grandly titled " Divine Secrets " when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Helped her believe I loved her -- even though I was what you might call an " uneven " mother . Sidda has always been melodramatic . Sidda said she especially loved the snapshots . Snapshots are just snapshots as far as I am concerned . Sidda analyzes everything too much , if you ask me . But this morning , I 'm the one who wants to study a photograph . And , of all things , it 's one with my mother in it . This morning I woke from the most vivid memory . It was not so much a dream as a completely clear picture of my mother , surrounded by flowers . It triggered an image that I just knew I had a photograph of . But I had to have my coffee before beginning the search . Photos in this house are not what you would call organized . You have to be an archaeologist to even form a search team . I 've always been too busy living to sit around for hours and arrange the photos and snapshots into proper family albums . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of AARP , but I am not retired . Or retiring , for that matter ! Hah ! I am busy , busy , busy . Work out at the club every single weekday . Bourre with the Ya-Yas . Cruises with Shep . And spending time in that garden of his . He 's out there so much that in order to see him , I have -- for the first time in my life -- put on a pair of deerskin gloves and done a very small amount of digging and weeding . He says it will grow on me . I say , What 's wrong with being a garden amateur ? Mass every Saturday afternoon . Confession twice a month . Reading everything I can get my hands on ( except science fiction , too much like my bad dreams ) . Playing tennis with Teensy and Chick . I am fit as hell . My constitution is amazing . My liver is in fine shape , to the everlasting shock of my doctors . The most trouble I have is a little arthritis in my hands . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in China who live to be one hundred and forty after smoking and drinking all their lives . Oh , there is pain in my life , but it is harder to put a name to it . Sometimes I lie in bed and wonder if there was a typhoid booster or dental checkup that I forgot to give Sidda , Little Shep , Lulu , or Baylor . Something I missed and should have done . Sometimes I lie in bed and wish I had just asked the kids what would have made them feel more loved . But I do not dwell , thank you very much . I follow Necie 's words of wisdom : " Just think pretty pink and blue thoughts . " After one strong cup of Dark Roast Community Coffee , I began scrounging through the hutch drawers where I keep most of our family snapshots . I had to pray to Saint Anthony , Patron Saint of Lost Objects , and he finally helped me find the image I wanted . It was stashed in the back of one of the hutch drawers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the things I love about Catholicism is that there is a saint for everything . If Sidda ca n't find a saint for something , that girl just makes one up . Even has one she calls Saint Madge of Menstruation . I do n't consider that blasphemous , although there was a time when I would have . Now I just call it creative ...
