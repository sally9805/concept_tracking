One way to chart the changing fortunes of presidential candidates is to note their shifting relations with the press . Back in December , an easy-breezy Howard Dean whiled away hours with his press corps , playing ( and routinely losing at ) Oh Hell ! , a card game he taught them . But by January , as his press contingent swelled to more than 50 , his schedule grew tight , and the cards were packed away . Now , with his campaign flagging , Dean is once more cozying up to the media . He 's dealing out the cards again and holding so many press conferences that reporters occasionally run out of questions . <P> Nearly the opposite has taken place on John Kerry 's campaign trail , where one-on-one interviews with the candidate are more rationed . Before his victories in Iowa and New Hampshire , Kerry had lots of time to be chummy , tossing footballs in the aisle of his " Real Deal Express " bus and often grabbing a vacant seat next to a reporter for an off-the-record chat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press contingent has grown to some 55 , the Senator makes fewer off-the-cuff remarks , and he does n't even ride on the bus anymore . He 's up front in a lead car , cocooned by his senior staff . <P> John Edwards ' dealings with the press have been steadier . Outwardly the most charismatic and gregarious in the race , Edwards is closed and guarded with the media . Once a day he strolls through the press section of his plane and chats casually , but the exercise never lasts more than five minutes . More often he sits alone with headphones on , tuning out the press . Part of that may be simple fatigue . Once , during an interview , Edwards simply dozed off . <P>  --  By Perry Bacon Jr. , Mitch Frank , Eric Roston and Douglas Waller
