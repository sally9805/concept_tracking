<p> You know you 're too busy when : <p> - You become distracted mid-application and manage to put deodorant on only one armpit . <p> - E-mails to yourself and sticky-note reminders stop working altogether and you have to make lists on the top of your hand in permanent marker . <p> - The inked reminders on your hand become such a frequent occurrence that your boss asks you if you have a tattoo . And he 's not joking . <p> - You ca n't sleep because your brain wo n't stop working on the six projects you 're juggling even when your body is bone tired , and the only effect Ambien has on you is the sudden supernatural ability to make French toast in the middle of the night ( which you discover when you find the syrup-covered plate on your nightstand ) . <p> - You forget where you 're going while you 're driving . Three times in two days . Once while you 're on your way home from the office . <p> - People ask you how you are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to mind is " busy . " <p> I 'm too busy . <p> I 'm also tired . <p> And I 'm tired of being too busy . <p> The day the Rev. Stephen Bauman came to visit me in Chicago a couple of weeks ago , I was so busy juggling news and tasks and obligations that I had to postpone our meeting . <p> And when we finally sat down to chat , it took me a few minutes to remember his first AND last names . <p> Dave . No . Phil . No . Steve . It 's Steve . Right . OK . Booker . No . Taubman . No . . . . <p> You get the picture . <p> There 's a reason someone came up with the term " scatterbrained . " <p> It seems , Bauman reassured me , that I 'm not alone . What I 'm suffering from is a systemic , cultural problem . <p> A WINDOW <p> We all need a break , says Bauman , longtime senior pastor of Christ Church in New York City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Values , Civility and Our Common Good . <p> " There are simple truths to which we all have access and these truths are lost in the clutter of our day and age , in the clutter and content of our information and everything that bombards us , " Bauman told me . " People are exhausted from it . " <p> Amen , my brother . <p> I 'm overwhelmed , I told him . And not just with tasks to do . The sheer volume of ideas and issues and urgent needs  --  personal and societal  --  and incessant conversations and noise of this American life are simply draining if you attempt to engage them intellectually , emotionally or spiritually . <p> People are looking for a restful moment . They 're searching for something simpler than this . They 're yearning for that still , small voice amidst the daily cacophony of shouted opinions , accusations and vitriol . <p> That 's what I 'm hearing from everyone and with increasing desperation . <p> It was precisely that sense of too much , too busy that led Bauman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His one-minute " prompts , " as they 're called , air on WCBS radio in New York , one of the city 's busiest news stations . <p> What could someone possibly say in a minute that could make a difference ? <p> " One minute is but a meaningless sound bite  --  that 's one response , I suppose , " Bauman wrote in the preface to Simple Truths , a collection of many of his thought-provoking but not expressly religious 60-second messages . " On the other hand , one minute might also be a window on eternity , or at least and more likely , the next hour . " <p> The idea of Bauman 's paid radio spots was to interrupt the rat-a-tat-tat of daily life with a kind of spiritual timeout . <p> BEATLE WISDOM <p> We suffer from chronic " partial attention , " Bauman said , offering one of his own stories as an example . <p> " My daughter called from college . I was working on the computer . I was on the phone with her and I hit call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . I was checking e-mail at the same time . I finished my call and I finished e-mailing . And a full 12 hours passed before I realized she had called , " he said . <p> " We have all of this ability to be in touch , but honest connection or robust connection is a different thing . So that becomes a choice , " he said . " When I can have everything , in order to have a simple life I have to choose one thing , not 15 things , particularly when it comes to determining what is important and meaningful in my life . Part of it is becoming alert . It 's not unlike the notion of waking up  --  waking up to everything that is in my world and my relationship to it . " <p> One message from Bauman 's book that I 've been ruminating on ( which I guess is the point ) was inspired by the death of former Beatle George Harrison after a long battle with cancer . <p> " Interestingly , the obituary I read at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , ' Everything else can wait , but the search for God can not wait , ' " Bauman wrote . " Ahead of his time 40-some years ago , I wonder if he was n't right on time for today . Perhaps it was his prolonged confrontation with mortality that catalyzed this homely wisdom . Given his notoriety , I thought this quiet expression served to amplify the wake-up call we 've experienced these first years of the new millennium . " <p> ' RELIGION AT ITS WORST ' <p> When we 're too busy , we forget about the things that actually matter . We do n't see the people around us . We do n't have time to consider them , to be civil , to make decisions that are kind  --  to others and to ourselves . <p> " We have to choose from this panoply , out of this wonderful cafeteria that is given to us , " Bauman said . " People are longing . They 're desperate . Not for 15 things , but for the one thing that really matters . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think we know what it might be . But , at the end of the day , as Jack Palance told Billy Crystal in " City Slickers , " " That 's what you 've got to figure out . " <p> Whatever it is , when you find it  --  when each of us discovers what it is that really matters  --  it will be simple . <p> " There is a deep yearning in our culture right now for a more substantial conversation about things that matter , " Bauman said . " One of the things that frustrates me most is the fact that the conversation that 's going on among the ' religious ' leaders in our culture is awful . It 's been completely politicized . It 's been co-opted by politics , willingly , for a cozy relationship with temporary power , which is religion at its worst . " <p> Sectarianism , partisanship and the vitriolic verbal attacks that often pass for public discourse are symptoms of a culture that 's too busy to consider civility , he said . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a sense , it 's a simple truth , " he said . " It 's perhaps not the deepest truth , civility , but I think it 's a reflection , a symptom , if you will , of our commitment to the common good . " <p> Sometimes when people suffer a heart attack or a stress-induced ailment , they end up saying it was a " wake-up call . " <p> I do n't want to have to slow down because my body does n't give me any other choice . <p> I do n't want to wake up that way . <p> Do you ? <p> - - - <p> e-mail : cfalsani@suntimes.com Photo : The Rev.
