If you were going to give a gold medal to the least delightful person on Earth , you would have to give that medal to a person named Carmelita Spats , and if you did n't give it to her , Carmelita Spats was the sort of person who would rip it from your hands anyway . Carmelita Spats was rude , she was violent , and she was filthy , and it is really a shame that I must describe her to you , because there are enough ghastly and distressing things in this story without even mentioning such an unpleasant person . It is the Baudelaire orphans , thank goodness , who are the heroes of this story , not the dreadful Carmelita Spats , and if you wanted to give a gold medal to Violet , Klaus , and Sunny Baudelaire , it would be for survival in the face of adversity . Adversity is a word which here means " trouble , " and there are very few people in this world who have had the sort of troubling adversity that follows these three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they were relaxing at the beach and received the distressing news that their parents had been killed in a terrible fire , and so were sent to live with a distant relative named Count Olaf . If you were to give a gold medal to Count Olaf , you would have to lock it up someplace before the awarding ceremony , because Count Olaf is such a greedy and evil man that he would try to steal it beforehand . The Baudelaire orphans did not have a gold medal , but they did have an enormous fortune that their parents had left them , and it was that fortune Count Olaf tried to snatch . The three siblings survived living with Count Olaf , but just barely , and since then Count Olaf has followed them everywhere , usually accompanied by one or more of his sinister and ugly associates . No matter who was caring for the Baudelaires , Count Olaf was always right behind them , performing such dastardly deeds that I can scarcely list them all : kidnapping , murder , nasty phone calls , disguises , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the adversities the Baudelaire orphans survived at his hands . Even worse , Count Olaf had a bad habit of avoiding capture , so he was always sure to turn up again . It is truly awful that this keeps happening , but that is how the story goes . I only tell you that the story goes this way because you are about to become acquainted with rude , filthy Carmelita Spats , and if you ca n't stand reading about her , you had better put this book down and read something else , because it only gets worse from here . Before too long , Violet , Klaus , and Sunny Baudelaire will have so much adversity that being shoved aside by Carmelita Spats will look like a trip to the ice cream store . " Get out of my way , you cakesniffers ! " said a rude , violent , and filthy little girl , shoving the Baudelaire orphans aside as she dashed by . Violet , Klaus , and Sunny were too startled to answer . They were standing on a sidewalk made of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a great deal of dark moss oozing out from in between them . Surrounding the sidewalk was a vast brown lawn that looked like it had never been watered , and on the lawn were hundreds of children running in various directions . It looked exhausting and pointless , two things that should be avoided at all costs , but the Baudelaire orphans barely glanced at the other children , keeping their eyes on the mossy bricks below them . Shyness is a curious thing , because , like quicksand , it can strike people at any time , and also , like quicksand , it usually makes its victims look down . This was to be the Baudelaires first day at Prufrock Preparatory School , and all three siblings found they would rather look at the oozing moss than at anything else . " Have you dropped something ? " Mr. Poe asked , coughing into a white handkerchief . One place the Baudelaires certainly did n't want to look was at Mr. Poe , who was walking closely behind them . Mr. Poe was a banker who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terrible fire , and this had turned out to be a lousy idea . Mr. Poe meant well , but a jar of mustard probably means well and would do a better job of keeping the Baudelaires out of danger . Violet , Klaus , and Sunny had learned long ago that the only thing they could count on from Mr. Poe was that he was always coughing . " No , " Violet replied , " we have n't dropped anything . " Violet was the oldest Baudelaire , and usually she was not shy at all . Violet liked to invent things , and one could often find her thinking hard about her latest invention , with her hair tied in a ribbon to keep it out of her eyes . When her inventions were done , she liked to show them to people she knew , who were usually very impressed with her skill . Right now , as she looked at the mossy bricks , she thought of a machine she could build that could keep moss from growing on the sidewalk but she felt too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the teachers , children , or administrative staff were interested in her inventions ? As if he were reading her thoughts , Klaus put a hand on Violet 's shoulder , and she smiled at him . Klaus had known for all twelve of his years that his older sister found a hand on her shoulder comforting  --  as long as the hand was attached to an arm , of course . Normally Klaus would have said something comforting as well , but he was feeling as shy as his sister . Most of the time , Klaus could be found doing what he liked to do best , which was reading . Some mornings one could find him in bed with his glasses on because he had been reading so late that he was too tired to take them off . Klaus looked down at the sidewalk and remembered a book he had read called Moss Mysteries , but he felt too shy to bring it up . What if Prufrock Preparatory School had nothing good to read ? Sunny , the youngest Baudelaire , looked up at her siblings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was easy to do because Sunny was a baby and only a little bit larger than a loaf of bread . Sunny was also too nervous to say anything , although it was often difficult to understand what she said when she did speak up . For instance , if Sunny had not been feeling so shy , she might have opened her mouth and said " Marimo ! " which may have meant " I hope there are plenty of things to bite at school , because biting things is one of my favorite things to do ! " " I know why you 're all so quiet , " Mr. Poe said . " It 's because you 're excited , and I do n't blame you . I always wanted to go to boarding school when I was younger but I never had the chance . I 'm a little jealous of you , if you want to know the truth . " The Baudelaires looked at one another . The fact that Prufrock Preparatory School was a boarding school was the part that made them feel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or there was nothing to read , or biting was n't allowed , they were stuck there , not only all day but all night as well . The siblings wished that if Mr. Poe were really jealous of them he would attend Prufrock Preparatory School himself , and they could work at the bank . " You 're very lucky to be here , " Mr. Poe continued . " I had to call more than four schools before I found one that could take all three of you at such short notice . Prufrock Prep  --  that 's what they call it , as a sort of nickname  --  is a very fine academy . The teachers all have advanced degrees . The dormitory rooms are all finely furnished . And most important of all , there is an advanced computer system which will keep Count Olaf away from you . Vice Principal Nero told me that Count Olaf 's complete description  --  everything from his one long eyebrow to the tattoo of an eye on his left ankle  --  has been programmed into the computer , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But how can a computer keep Count Olaf away ? " Violet asked in a puzzled voice , still looking down at the ground . " It 's an advanced computer , " Mr. Poe said , as if the word " advanced " were a proper explanation instead of a word meaning " having attained advancement . " " Do n't worry your little heads about Count Olaf . Vice Principal Nero has promised me that he will keep a close eye on you . After all , a school as advanced as Prufrock Prep would n't allow people to simply run around loose . " " Move , cakesniffers ! " the rude , violent , and filthy little girl said as she dashed by them again . " What does ' cakesniffers ' mean ? " Violet murmured to Klaus , who had an enormous vocabulary from all his reading . " I do n't know , " Klaus admitted , " but it does n't sound very nice . " " What a charming word that is , " Mr. Poe said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it reminds me of pastry . Oh well , here we are . " They had come to the end of the mossy brick sidewalk and stood in front of the school . The Baudelaires looked up at their new home and gasped in surprise . Had they not been staring at the sidewalk the whole way across the lawn , they would have seen what the academy looked like , but perhaps it was best to delay looking at it for as long as possible . A person who designs buildings is called an architect , but in the case of Prufrock Prep a better term might be " depressed architect . " The school was made up of several buildings , all made of smooth gray stone , and the buildings were grouped together in a sort of sloppy line . To get to the buildings , the Baudelaires had to walk beneath an immense stone arch casting a curved shadow on the lawn , like a rainbow in which all the colors were gray or black . On the arch were the words " PRUFROCK PREPARATORY SCHOOL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller letters , the motto of the school , " Memento Mori . " But it was not the buildings or the arch that made the children gasp , it was how the buildings were shaped  --  rectangular with a rounded top is a strange shape , and the children could only think of one thing with that shape . To the Baudelaires each building looked exactly like a gravestone . " Rather odd architecture , " Mr. Poe commented . " Each building looks like a thumb . In any case , you are to report to Vice Principal Nero 's office immediately . It 's on the ninth floor of the main building . " " Are n't you coming with us , Mr. Poe ? " Violet asked . Violet was fourteen , and she knew that fourteen was old enough to go to somebody 's office by herself , but she felt nervous about walking into such a sinister-looking building without an adult nearby . Mr. Poe coughed into his handkerchief and looked at his wristwatch at the same time . " I 'm afraid not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The banking day has already begun . But I 've talked over everything with Vice Principal Nero , and if there 's any problem , remember you can always contact me or any of my associates at Mulctuary Money Management . Now , off you go . Have a wonderful time at Prufrock Prep . " " I 'm sure we will , " said Violet , sounding much braver than she felt . " Thank you for everything , Mr. Poe . " " Yes , thank you , " Klaus said , shaking the banker 's hand . " Terfunt , " Sunny said , which was her way of saying , " thank you . " " You 're welcome , all of you , " Mr. Poe said . " So long . " He nodded at all three Baudelaires and Violet and Sunny watched him walk back down the mossy sidewalk , carefully avoiding the running children . But Klaus did n't watch him . Klaus was looking at the enormous arch over the academy . " Maybe I do n't know what ' cakesniffer ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can translate our new school 's motto . " " It does n't even look like it 's in English , " Violet said , peering up at it . " Racho , " Sunny agreed . " It 's not , " Klaus said . " It 's in Latin . Many mottoes are in Latin , for some reason . I do n't know very much Latin , but I do remember reading this phrase in a book about the Middle Ages . If it means what I think it means , it 's certainly a strange motto . " " What do you think it means ? " Violet asked . " If I 'm not mistaken , " said Klaus , who was rarely mistaken , " Memento Mori means ' Remember you will die . ' " " Remember you will die , " Violet repeated quietly , and the three siblings stepped closer to one another , as if they were very cold . Everybody will die , of course , sooner or later . Circus performers will die , and clarinet experts will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there might be a person who lives on your block , right now , who is not looking both ways before he crosses the street and who will die in just a few seconds , all because of a bus . Everybody will die , but very few people want to be reminded of that fact . The children certainly did not want to remember that they would die , particularly as they walked beneath the arch over Prufrock Prep . The Baudelaire orphans did not need to be reminded of this as they began their first day in the giant graveyard that was now their home .
