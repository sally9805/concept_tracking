1 September 28 , 1984 Norwich , Connecticut She did n't feel quite right about the red dress ; it was n't a red dress kind of day . The blue one was nice . She 'd tried on the blue one twice already , but the more she thought about it , the more she knew it had to be green . Yes , green would be best for today . " Green , " she said , satisfied , laying it out neatly on the bed . She put nylons , panties , and jewelry next to it and went downstairs in her slip to vacuum the living room for the third time this morning . By nine she was at the kitchen table , stirring a cup of tea that she had no intention of drinking . She got up twice  --  once to search for cigarettes , then forgot what she was looking for and came back empty-handed ; once to answer the doorbell , but as usual there was no one there . She chewed the skin on her knuckles , studying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seals on the sides of the doors were dappled with mold , a job for Mr. Clean or Clorox or Natural Citrus , she could never remember which . Her nerves were shot , she thought , laughing out loud . " Silly , silly me . " She pinched her wrist until it hurt , glanced up at the second hand sweeping the yellowsunburst wall clock . " One , " she said out loud , and then " two , " but by " eight " she could n't get the words out anymore , and the first tear of the day plunked into her tea . She stared at the murky ripples in the cup , looking for a sign . Why could n't she feel anything ? Why could n't she remember anything ? What was she missing that the rest of the world seemed to have ? She breathed in the warmth rising from the cup , the sweet cinnamon and sassafras collecting around her nostrils , and formed a crooked smile . She would like to have had people think of her as eccentric  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a screw loose . That was the problem and everyone knew it . The ripples in the tea went still ; she watched her reflection transforming into a gingerbread girl , silver candied beads thumb-pressed into a tiara . She smiled at the memory of rolling dough with her grandmother , but only for a second . There was a shadow behind the woman , and it portended bad things . The image of the gingerbread girl began to soak up the tea and then an arm broke away , a leg , and at last the head sank into the murky liquid and the girl with the tiara was no more . The noon bell tolled from Our Lady of Joy on Madison Street . Her eyes snapped up to the clock , then to the telephone on the wall , then to the grocery list on the refrigerator . She had been thinking about the refrigerator off and on all morning , but she did n't know why . She took a deep breath . Where had the morning gone ? she wondered . It seemed as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Groceries and green , " she said evenly , " groceries and green . " That 's why she 'd picked the green dress for today . It was to remind her of something , but what ? Maybe John knew ? John knew everything . She wanted to call John , but they would only tell her he was at work . That 's what they always told her . Work , work , work , could n't they understand that she needed to talk to him ? She shivered . The house suddenly felt cold . She looked at the telephone again , then the door to the living room . Maybe she should turn on the television and check the weather . Maybe she would need a raincoat when she went out . " No , no , silly girl . It 's not supposed to rain all week . You 're just trying to think of excuses not to go upstairs . " She put a hand on her chest , took a deep breath , and slid her fingers beneath the silk slip . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nipple until it was hard , tears running down both cheeks now , and slowly she stood . With her hand still on her breast , she started for the stairs . The mask was in a bottom drawer under a yellow sweat suit she had bought at Neiman Marcus . What she planned to do with a sweat suit , she had no idea . She 'd never worn anything but knee-length dresses all her life . That was about the only thing she was allowed to wear as a child . That was all she cared to wear as an adult . Besides , she was the same weight now that she had been in high school . Sweatpants were for women who either were trying to lose weight or had accepted the fact that they were n't going to . That 's what her neighbor Celia was always saying . That 's why she 'd never put on the yellow sweatpants . Celia ? Why did she just think of Celia ? Why did Celia make her think about the grocery list ? It was Friday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though she had just been to the store on Tuesday . Why in God 's name had n't she remembered to get them on Tuesday ? It must have been one of those senior moments , like Celia was always joking about . She closed her eyes and pursed her lips . " Concentrate , concentrate , " she told herself . " John says you never concentrate enough . That 's why you never get anything done . " A moment later she sighed , pushed Celia from her thoughts , and looked down at the mask , not unlike the way a junkie looks at a tourniquet : wanting it , repulsed by it , repulsed by herself . She lifted her hair and pinned it behind her ears . Then she picked up the mask and held it in both hands , thumbs kneading the rubber collar , tracing the molded cast of the rubber face piece . It was Soviet made and as obsolete as its designers , but then almost everything John handled was obsolete , from dated survival gear to archaic uniforms , things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact the only thing he handled that was new were the medical kits he took to restock nursing homes . The mask had a frightening quality , she thought . She remembered the first time she had seen the boxes in the basement . The cartons were labeled Red Army-SchM-1 M38  --  1941 . Someone had written helmet across the box in Magic Marker . It was n't a helmet , of course , more of a hood , and the face was made to look like that of a giant insect or one of the aliens you see in vintage comic books . It was black and smooth , with a broad forehead and a triangular chin . Its eyes were round glass panes , and over its mouth there was a respirator hose attached , which was supposed to match up to a filter canister , but canisters would be in other boxes that were n't in the house and you did n't need one anyhow unless you were trying not to breathe contaminated air . She could n't explain why she had to put it on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to . That was almost a year ago . By now she had gotten very good at it . She tilted her chin and slipped the hood over her head , pressed the face piece against her cheeks , and sucked the air out of the mask until it was snug . She grasped the footlong hose that protruded from the mouthpiece , took a deep breath , and heard the rushing of air through the intake hose . Then she cupped off the open end of the hose with her hand and felt the stifling discomfort of a vacuum . This was a world where you could n't bring your little problems , your little idiosyncrasies . This was a place of the present , of focus , where you thought about yourself and nothing else . This was the amateur walking the high wire . Things looked different when the senses were ratcheted up to the nth degree ; the world looked unfamiliar through the lenses of the round glass eye portals . She was on the other side of the continuum , anonymous and looking back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put her hand on her face , caressing the slick black rubber . Her husband handled the masks all the time , but John would never have appreciated the beauty , would never have considered putting one on . Poor dismal John in his world of gray . He saw no good , no bad ; no happy , no sad . She knew she was to blame . She knew that she weighed heavily on his mind . John , who worked three menial jobs to support her and all the while she was forgetting or burning his dinner , spending like she was out of control , having no interest in his hands , his lips , unable to respond to his slightest attempts at affection . She knew all that . She knew too that he loved her , even though he understood there was no love inside of her to give back . It was n't that she did n't love him in particular . She had no love for anyone . She was devoid of the feeling and there was nothing he could do , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had come to terms with that long ago . He would be horrified to look at her now . He knew that she had secrets . He knew there were nights she walked the streets alone , was not at the movies with friends . He knew she drank and she did , but only to anesthetize her racing mind . She used the mask when she was home alone , because when she put it on , she was n't responsible anymore . She was n't the disgraceful wife and mother . She was n't a bad girl anymore . She pushed off the straps of her slip and let it fall to the floor . She took a terry-cloth belt from one of John 's old bathrobes and walked mechanically to the bathroom , where she closed the door and pulled the old wicker clothes hamper to the middle of the floor and stepped on it . One end of the belt had been fashioned into a noose , and this she slipped over her head , pulling it snug around the collar of the gas mask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hook she 'd bought at a Home Depot . She slipped the S hook through the antique iron ring that held the light fixture , stuffed a small washcloth into the hose , and let her knees bend until the fixture took the weight of her body . Slowly she picked up her feet and put her hands down , closing her eyes to a faint field of stars , nerve endings prickling . She put her hands on her breasts , then on her stomach , and goose bumps began to rise on her arms and thighs . She felt her head begin to clear , the clutter of her craziness dissipating into the vacuum of space . She groaned at the pleasure , put a foot on the hamper , and pushed to take the weight off the noose . She found the slightest bit of oxygen in the air she sucked through the plugged hose , prolonging the experience ; then she dropped again , and again , until she was nearing climax . One more minute , one more breath ; she arched her foot , toes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she heard a loud snap and a leg of the hamper skidded across the bathroom floor and under the space beneath the closed door . She fell five inches fast and jerked to a stop , arms shooting upward to grab the light fixture , legs kicking frantically to find the hamper again . She could n't die like this , she could n't be here ; she could n't let them see how pathetic she was . She swiped up at the hook above her head , breaking lightbulbs . Glass rained down over her . She began to get dizzy , the glass eye windows fogged , she thrashed about some more , then her arms fell to her sides , muscles contracting , spasms contorting her back . Her fingers were clenched into fists , legs swinging over the broken hamper , feet trying to catch the edge , and then suddenly she managed to touch a corner of the hamper with a big toe . The doorbell rang . She hung there as still as possible , arms at her side , one leg out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hamper now leaning precariously to one side . The doorbell rang again . Celia ? She put pressure on the toe , managing to rise gently a quarter of an inch . The old wicker groaned under her weight . It was enough to relieve the pressure on her neck , but she was panicking and there was little oxygen to be had through the plugged tube . She tried to calm herself , to hold off as long as she dared without breathing , then put pressure on the toe again to rise and catch another breath , letting herself down again . Someone was knocking now , knocking persistently on the door , and no one but Celia ever came to her door anymore . What had she forgotten this time ? Was she supposed to do something for Celia ? Suddenly she thought of the grocery list on the refrigerator . Was she supposed to go to the store with Celia to buy something ? The doorbell quieted . The knocking stopped . Whoever it was had given up . Green and Greg 's mom and groceries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a careful breath . How many more could she get before the hamper broke ? It was Friday and the end of a week of school . The first hint of orange tinged the leaves around the old brick schoolhouse . The sun was low on the horizon , casting long shadows of the maple trees onto the city streets . He ran his hand along the iron picket fence that went around the playground , kicked a tennis ball lost by a dog , and jumped over a fire hydrant . Horns persisted on distant Fremont , where people rushed home from work to the suburbs . His father would be at work until midnight at his second job , stocking nursing homes with medical supplies . He was never at home to take him anywhere . They had never played ball together or gone to a game . The family had never taken a vacation together . It seemed there were always bills to be paid , groceries to buy . He could n't understand why the other boys ' fathers were able to do things his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper was still rolled and stuck in the door . The old blue Nova was still parked at the curb . His mother must not have gone shopping . His heart sank in a long moment of wretched disappointment . He started for the house again , crossed the street , and tried not to doubt her . The windows looked dark at Greg 's . Greg 's mom 's little white Toyota was not in front of her house either . Stop it , he told himself . She wo n't forget . She would n't forget this time . He took the steps two at a time . " Home , " he yelled , letting the screen door bang . He opened the fridge and grabbed a Pepsi , snapped the can , and climbed on the counter , looking in the space above the kitchen cabinets for something to eat . His mother often bought junk food and hid it from herself . She was forever buying things and forgetting about them . He knew most of her hiding places  --  candy in the well on top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs , shoes under the twin beds in the extra bedroom . She had a way of acting as if there were different people inside of her , all fighting for her attention at the same time , all disagreeing . She 'd buy a television for the kitchen and put it in the attic . She 'd light cigarettes only to stamp them out . She 'd fix a drink and pour it down the sink , open a savings account and close it in the same day . She never wore the same clothes all day long , never returned clothes that did n't fit , never read the books she purchased or watched the movies she rented . It was as if she were guided by opposing voices . " Mom ? " he yelled , grabbing a handful of Oreos from an open package , guzzling the soda . " I 'm going next door to Greg 's . " He was only kidding , of course . He could n't go next door until everything was ready . Until his friends got home from school and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Greg 's . He knew about the surprise birthday party two weeks ago . Greg had heard his mother suggest it to Greg 's mom , Celia , who offered to have it at her house so it would be a surprise . She would make him clean his room or do homework or something to take up the time . " Mom ? " No answer . Maybe she was still over at Celia 's ? Maybe she was putting candles on the cake or tying a ribbon on a new bicycle ? Maybe she was hiding in the dining room with the blue eighteen-speed , waiting to yell surprise ? She had a hard time keeping things to herself . Sometimes she would give Christmas presents to people at Thanksgiving . It was n't really his birthday , not until tomorrow , but Greg was going to Six Flags with his parents in the morning , so it was the only time he could be there , and Greg was his very best friend . He knew he 'd be getting the blue bike he saw in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad about last year . She promised she would never forget one of his birthdays again . She 'd go overboard on Nintendo cartridges and other things too , as she was prone to do . Never able to make up her mind , she ended up buying everything she looked at rather than selecting one thing . He looked in the laundry room , walked into the living room , then back through the dining room into the kitchen . " Mom ? " He looked up the stairs . He grabbed the handrail . " Mom ? " he said a little less loudly , a little less enthusiastically . He took the steps two at a time , walked the hall toward the bedrooms . Her door was open and a green dress was laid out on the bed . He saw nylons and jewelry lying next to it . Her purse was hanging on the doorknob , an envelope with one of his father 's paychecks sticking out of it . She should have gone to the bank to deposit the checks before she went shopping . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the hall , and saw the bathroom door was closed . He walked toward it , frowned as he bent over to pick up a piece of broken white cane protruding from under it . " Mom ? " He opened the door slowly . He screamed . She was hanging from the old light fixture , naked , her face and hair covered by a black rubber mask with glass eyes and a respirator hose for a mouth . There was something stuck in the end of the hose , a rag perhaps or a kerchief . The clothes hamper was on its side beneath her feet , spilling yesterday 's underwear and towels on the floor . She had a toe on it ; he could see her foot arched like a ballerina 's , muscles quivering to hold her weight up . He stepped into the room and could see her eyes now through the round glass windows . She was looking down at him , eyes wide , wild , intense . The phone rang . He heard the wicker groaning beneath her trembling foot as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her eyes for the longest time . Then he backed up and sat on the toilet seat and stared at her . The telephone rang again . It would be Greg , calling to tell him the bad news . That his mother had n't come through , once again . And for what ? He knew very well what this was , knew from exploring every inch of the house and his mother 's hiding places , her so-called diary that she managed to write in fewer than a dozen times a year . She had done this to herself . This was the meaning of her " other place , " her " dark world , the only place I can feel pleasure without pain . " It was just one more of her fucking peculiarities , the crazy side of her that everyone was always pretending not to see . This mask , this noose , this thing she was doing to her body was more important than his birthday . This was the kind of shit she woke up thinking about rather than him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the doorbell rang , someone knocked , and he ignored it all . He could still see her eyes from where he was sitting . She was watching him , eyes never blinking , toe trembling on the corner of that hamper . Finally he got up , walked over to the hamper , and kicked it out from under her . She dropped fast ; their eyes locked together as she bounced . He stood there a few feet away , eyes never leaving hers , until he was sure she was dead , until there was no more soul looking back . He heard knocking at the door , persistent now . He walked to the window and looked out to see Celia . She would have known all along it would n't happen . Just like all the other mothers would have known . There never was going to be a birthday party . There never was going to be an eighteen-speed bicycle . She 'd forgotten about him again . Just like the times she forgot to pick him up at school , or when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to parents ' day or the soccer game or the school play . He had all but stopped saying it . That his mother was going to be somewhere or she was going to do this or that . He could n't stand that look on the other kids ' faces . " You did n't forget to do this , did you ? " he said to his dead mother , his chin trembling . " How in the fuck did you remember to do this ? " He wiped angry tears from his eyes with the heels of his hands . " Was this more important than me ? " He went to his room , got his pocketknife , and came back and cut her down . She collapsed in a heap at his feet . He grabbed her under the armpits and dragged her down the hall , where he put her on her bed . It took thirty minutes to get her into the clothes she had laid out , then he brushed her hair and cleaned the mucus and the smeared lipstick from her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then took the mask to his room , where he hid it under his mattress . Back in the bedroom he sat in a corner chair and looked at her until his father got home . It was nearly midnight . The newspapers called it suicide and no one seriously questioned the fact . Mary Dentin had a screw loose , the neighbors told police . Mary was just like her own crazy mother , who stepped in front of a metro bus one Christmas morning . Mary 's grandfather was the only next of kin she had , save husband and son , and he looked less than happy to be drawn into a funeral . That did n't really surprise the boy ; his mother was always uncomfortable around the old man and it seemed there was no love lost between them . When he left after the service that day , the boy never saw him again . His own father was an outsider , even to his mother . He lived with her and he loved her , but he knew less about her than anyone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quit all three of his jobs . He would sit in his threadbare recliner all day with a newspaper in his lap and a pen in his hand . He had taken up his wife 's erratic habits of smoking Pall Malls and drinking Maker 's Mark bourbon . He filled the borders around the printed articles with random words like room road automobile breach germany korea cold . He would write the words in bold print , turning the paper sideways and upside-down , until there was no more room in which to write . Then he would fall asleep in his chair . He would still be there in the morning , staring vacantly at the paper as he bade him good-bye for school . For weeks it went on . The house remained silent , the lamps sparely lit . The phone never rang ; friends never came to visit . It was as if they had all had died together . One day his father showed up at school , the station wagon packed tight with boxes , and they drove west .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
