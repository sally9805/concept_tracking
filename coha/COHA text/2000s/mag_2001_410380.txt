<p> He 's no union leader , lawyer , or human rights investigator . But for the people who labor in the garment sweatshops of New York 's Chinatown , Wing Lam is as close as it gets . <p> The Headquarters of the Chinese Staff and Workers ' Association is situated a few blocks cast of New York 's City Hall . To get to it , you enter through 15 Catherine Street , a grim tenement sandwiched between a fish stall and a Chinese bakery . You then climb a narrow metal staircase , leave the building through a back door above the second floor , and cross an open bridge made of steel plates . This bridge leads down to a second building , which was originally designed for storage and is completely cut off from the street . The arrangement has certain obvious disadvantages , but a few years ago . when someone hoping to intimidate Chinese Staff tried to set fire to the place from above , it fortuitously turned out that the ceiling was made of concrete and would n't burn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divided into several smaller ones by a series of wooden partitions . Wing Lam , the association 's executive director , has his own office  --  a tiny , closet-like affair almost entirely taken up by legal files  --  but he rarely occupies it . Instead , he can usually be found in the main room , where two battered metal desks have been pushed together to form an approximation of a conference table . One day this spring , I found him sitting at the desks , clutching a manila envelope . <p> Lam , who is 52 , has a broad face , longish hair that is constantly flopping down over his eyes , and prominent front teeth . He speaks idiosyncratic English , weeps easily , and , in his own quiet way , can talk almost uninterruptedly for hours at a stretch . As soon as I sat down , Lam opened the manila envelope and pulled out a glossy picture of a man named Jian Wen Liang . <p> Liang had operated a pair of garment factories in Brooklyn that manufactured women 's sportswear . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded that they put in 100-hour weeks without overtime , and had systematically skimmed 5 percent from their wages . The picture showed Liang being led off to jail on March 5 , apparently in handcuffs . Whenever someone new would come into the office , Lam would slide the photo out of the envelope to show it off . " My trophy , " he said , chuckling . <p> Lam could be called a labor organizer , and Chinese Staff a labor organization , although neither term would be entirely adequate . Chinese Staff serves as an intermediary between immigrant workers and labor enforcement agencies , acting as a goad to both sides . Without its encouragement , many workers would be too scared to file complaints against their employers , and without its constant pestering , many prosecutors would n't follow up on them . <p> In New York 's Chinese-language newspapers , the Liang case was big news . The last time anyone could remember a similar prosecution was a decade ago , when another sweatshop owner , Stanley Chang , had become the first garment-factory owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's punishment even made English-language papers like the New York Daily News , which published the story under the headline " Buttonholed at Last . " <p> In general , Liang 's sentence  --  90 days and a $10,000 fine  --  was taken as a sign of the peculiar viciousness of his conduct . He had , the News asserted , operated " some of the worst garment sweatshops in the city . " It would probably be closer to the truth , however , to describe his tactics as fairly typical . Liang ended up in jail because he was peculiarly stubborn , and quite possibly also stupid , but mostly because he was unlucky , this last quality having mainly to do with the fact that he had run up against Wing Lam . <p> One afternoon when I arrived at Chinese Staff 's office , Lam was sitting at the desks with a group of half a dozen women . A collection of clothes labels was spread out before them . The women were grim-faced and Lam looked tense . They were speaking to one another in Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Lam was reading the women the riot act . <p> After the visitors had packed up their labels and left , Lam explained that the group had come to him earlier complaining about a factory owner who owed them nearly $100,000 in back wages . Then he had n't heard from them for several months . Lam had been trying to impress on the women that they were n't going to get their money without fighting for it . Once Chinese Staff determines that a complaint is justified , its chief concern in deciding to pursue a case  --  either by filing a lawsuit or by bringing it to the attention of prosecutors  --  is whether the workers will stick through what can be years of court dates and hearings . " We want them to understand : We are not like government , " Lam told me . " They got to be involved . " <p> A lot of workers bring the stories of their hardships to Lam , thinking that he will be moved by their suffering and will try to solve their problems for them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solving their problems but not , as they might like , quietly , through back channels . Lam used to give his business card to nearly everyone he met , but a few years ago , he discovered that workers were simply flashing his card as a way to win better treatment . Now , he rarely hands out cards . " The main thing : We ask workers ' commitment to help other workers , " he says . " That 's the only way we have strength . " <p> Much of Lam 's work is anachronistic ; the labor conditions he is fighting have been illegal for more than half a century . But having a law on the books and having it enforced are , in this case , two entirely different things . At any given moment , there are more than 3,000 garment factories operating in New York City , and it is estimated that two-thirds of them violate such basic labor standards as paying the minimum wage or compensating workers for overtime . In Los Angeles , there are some 5,000 garment shops , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sweatshops . Similarly in the restaurant trade  --  the other main occupation of recent Chinese immigrants  --  it is routine for workers to get less than the minimum wage , to put in seven-day weeks , and to be forced to give up part of their tips to their bosses . Restaurant workers come to Chinese Staff for help from as far away as Florida . <p> Lam has no legal training , and Chinese Staff has no lawyers ; nevertheless , the group is constantly generating lawsuits against employers  --  as many as a hundred a year-most of which are handled by attorneys from the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund , and from big firms that donate time pro bono . " Wing thinks that if you fight hard enough and long enough you can change the system , " says Ken Kimerling , the fund 's legal director . " He 's given people an opportunity to fight back who otherwise would have just gone on being victims . " <p> Over the years , Chinese Staff has had many legal victories , in cases involving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest win was a $1.1 million judgment against one of Chinatown 's most prominent restaurants , Jing Fong , in 1997 ; after much legwork by Chinese Staff , the state attorney general successfully sued the restaurant for cheating nearly five dozen workers out of tips and wages . It is these occasional triumphs that keep Lam going , Kimerling speculates , in a trade where long-term improvements in working conditions remain elusive . Especially in the garment industry , he observes , " it 's hard to see major changes , except the other way . " <p> Lam is , in addition to lawsuits , an enthusiast of protests , boycotts , and pickets . One picket line he helped organize , in front of the Silver Palace restaurant in lower Manhattan , has been in place for so long now that the placards are in tatters and the cardboard coffin , which is supposed to symbolize the death of " slave labor , " has developed a permanent sag . In its complexity and its sheer duration , the Silver Palace picket is an exemplary Lam crusade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly remember the intricacies of his many campaigns , Lam waved his hands in front of his face , a gesture that conveyed the recognition that he was , in this respect , not entirely normal . ) <p> The battle began back in August 1993 , when a group of Silver Palace workers challenged the restaurant 's practice of confiscating part of each day 's tips . It continued through a seven-month lockout , an unrelated legal dispute that revealed that the owners were keeping two sets of books , and a lawsuit by the state attorney general on behalf of the workers . In 1995 and 1996 , a state court and the National Labor Relations Board awarded the workers a combined $1.1 million ; at that point , the restaurant declared bankruptcy and was reorganized , ostensibly under new management . Five years later , not a dollar of the award has been paid . <p> Lam recounted the saga of the Silver Palace to me one bitter cold evening when I was preparing to go out with the picketers . <p> Chinese Staff has only five full-time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundation grants ) , but every time I visited , the office was filled with volunteers  --  old men , young women with babies , and college students , many , but not all of them , Chinese . On this particular evening , there was a great deal of bustle as several of the restaurant 's " dim sum ladies , " together with a collection of volunteers , assembled their gear . I asked Lam whether he found the story of the Silver Palace disheartening . " I 'm pretty stubborn , " he said . <p> Lam discovered labor organizing in an accidental sort of way . In 1978 , he was working as a shipping clerk in a Long Island City garment factory when , together with another clerk , he learned that the workers were getting paid 50 cents an hour less than their contract required . The factory was a union shop , so the two men took their finding to the union 's leaders , who vowed to get to the bottom of the matter . A union representative came to visit the factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big mouths get the pink slip . " <p> Lam is reluctant to reveal a great deal about his life outside work . When I first approached him late last year , he kept suggesting to me that I write about someone else in the labor movement instead . Eventually , I learned that Lain had been born in Tianjin , had lived in Hong Kong and , later , Brazil . His mother had been a seamstress and his father had worked a variety of odd jobs including , at one point , selling ice cream . Lam arrived in the United States at age 17 , speaking virtually no English , but managed to get a degree in electrical engineering , a subject he says he found " boring . " <p> After losing his job in Long Island City , he went to work for the same union  --  the International Ladies ' Garment Workers ' Union ( ILGWU )  --  that he believed had betrayed him . ( The union is now called UNITE . ) According to Lam , the only reason he got the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment for the troublemaker is to take them in , " and the only reason he took it was that he needed the money . The job involved hiring himself out as a garment worker in order to organize a shop from the inside . Lam found he was quite good at garment work , particularly pressing , but not good at getting along with his bosses . In his three years with the union , he managed to get himself fired twice . <p> While Lam was still with the ILGWU , a group of workers formed Chinese Staff to push for more effective representation from the white-run trade unions , and Lam acted as an adviser . " Union just for show " is a favored phrase of Lam 's , and it is true that while many of the garment factories in Chinatown are unionized , this has not prevented widespread labor-law violations . <p> For its part , UNITE is equally critical of Lam , saying that he ought to be working with the union , not against it . Steven Weingarten , UNITE 's industrial director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put pressure on retailers and manufacturers who subcontract with sweatshops . " We 've got an enormous problem , and the question is , How do we build a strategy that shifts power back to the workers ? " he says . Weingarten acknowledges that many garment shops do not fully comply with their union contracts , but maintains that if UNITE pushed harder , the shops would simply shut down . This argument-that the union can not enforce its own contracts because it would drive work away  --  is precisely what infuriates Lam . <p> Official New York views Chinese Staff 's efforts with decidedly mixed emotions . The group 's work is essential to many labor-law prosecutions , like the Liang case , which according to one of the prosecutors involved would never have gone to court had Lam not convinced the workers to testify . By the same token , Lam is never satisfied ; frequently he attacks the very government agencies he is assisting . " He 's always demanding a little more of you , " the prosecutor says . " He 'll say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felony ? ' He calls once a week with a new case or a possibility . " <p> " There are people who attack him left and right , but he sticks by it , " says Louis Vanegas , the district director of the U.S. Labor Department 's wage and hour division for New York . " He 's persistent . " Vanegas says he has seen many immigrant workers ' groups form , only to get discouraged and give up within a few years . Lam and Chinese Staff , he notes , have stayed the course for two decades . " People get burned out in that kind of work very fast , " Vanegas says . " But Wing has maintained the stamina . " <p> In certain segments of Chinatown , Lam is quite openly despised . In early 1995 , Chinese Staff organized a picket line in front of ling Fong , after a waiter who had challenged the restaurant 's practice of docking tips was fired . Later , a group of students staged a hunger strike in front of the restaurant , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the battle , an ad appeared in several Chinatown newspapers featuring a picture of Lam ; the caption called him " the devil that is destroying the Chinatown economy . " Around the same time , signs went up in front of the restaurant rendering Lam 's Chinese name , Lam Shung , as " Lam Jung , " which means " near death . " It was at that point that Lam started parking his car in a garage , rather than on the street . <p> During the battle over Jing Fong , flyers were circulated that accused Lam of extorting tens of thousands of dollars from various restaurant owners . Though no evidence was ever produced to corroborate this accusation , in Chinatown the flyers succeeded in sowing doubt about Lam 's motives . In 1996 , Lam sued the management of Jing Fong for libel . When the case finally came to trial last winter , one of the owners testified that life in Chinatown would be better if Lam were , in fact , dead . The jury found that Lam had been libeled but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stopped by Chinese Staff 's office , Lam was talking to a young woman with a sad face and a tiny scar at the corner of her mouth . He told me that the young woman had an " interesting story , " which I took to mean that she was miserable , and with him translating , she agreed to recount it for me , minus certain details , such as her name , that could be of use to the INS . <p> The young woman was in her 20s  --  she declined to be more specific  --  and had been brought into the country five years ago by a smuggler who had arranged for her passage by way of Mexico . She had grown up near Fuzhou , a port city in southeastern China , where her mother worked in a factory and her father worked for the government . Although her family was not affluent , they were not poor . She explained her decision to come to the United States by saying , through Lam , " Everybody says America very good . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I asked if she would have come had she known what she knows now , she said , " I do n't know . " <p> The young woman had wanted a job in New York , but had n't been able to find one and had ended up in a Chinese restaurant in New Jersey . She was making about $100 a day , $18 of which she had to give back to her boss . Meanwhile , she owed her smugglers $30,000 . Eventually she left that job , and now she was working in a restaurant in Pennsylvania . There she was earning even less than she had in New Jersey . <p> Fifteen or twenty years ago , most of New York 's Chinatown was Cantonese ; today , new immigrants are increasingly Fuzhounese , and East Broadway south of Canal is commonly referred to as " Fuzhou Street . " Like the young woman , a lot of these new immigrants come with huge debts to notoriously unsympathetic creditors . More established Chinese immigrants tend to blame these newcomers  --  the wu sun fin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wages for everyone . Lam , too , says that wages have been falling in Chinatown and that the influx of new immigrants is partly responsible ; lacking legal protection , they often feel they have no choice but to accept illegal working conditions . In Chinese , he points out , smugglers of illegal immigrants are known as " snakeheads " and their charges as " snakes . " <p> " Where you can find a snake ? " he asks . " Under something . Very dark , very wet . That 's where the snake goes . No-law land . " <p> But for Lam , the Fuzhounese are , in their desperation , no different really from every other low-wage earner . " People think work is better than no work , " he told me . " Unfortunately , the real truth is , even if you work 14 hours , someone is willing to work 16 hours . " It is this same logic , in essence , that underlies American labor law : The minimum wage and the 40-hour week are supposed to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . One of the results , of course , is that millions of jobs have moved overseas , where no such obstacles exist . <p> This dilemma is well understood in Chinatown . Often workers are the only good source of information about what is going on in a garment factory or a restaurant kitchen , and typically they refuse to talk . Indeed , sometimes they will go so far as to rally in support of the bosses accused of exploiting them : One of the stranger twists in the Liang case came when the Labor Department impounded some of the illegally manufactured clothes . Dozens of workers marched on the department 's offices , demanding that the clothing be released . <p> Lam 's response to this frustrating reality has been to expand his ambitions . Along with the seamstress earning $3 an hour , he maintains that office workers and freelancers who work without benefits are also sweatshop workers , as is anyone who accepts inadequate wages or ridiculously long hours in order to keep a job . Among his many goals is to transform mothering into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " People only want to settle for what is possible , " he says . <p> Situated just a few miles east of Chinatown , Sunset Park is an unremarkable Brooklyn neighborhood of attached two-story houses bisected by a busy commercial strip . At one point , the area was populated by Scandinavians , and it is still possible to find a few traces of this era , like the Norwegian flag on the sign for the Sporting Club Gjoa . Overwhelmingly , though , the neighborhood is now Chinese , and the businesses along the strip bear names that translate along the lines of " Million Gold Barber Center " and " Chungyuan Herb Corp . " For the last five years , Chinese Staff has operated a satellite office in Sunset Park in what was once a pizzeria-there are still " his " and " hers " bathrooms and a mirrored wall left over from the previous tenant  --  and a few months ago I arranged to meet Lam there . <p> Most of the garment factories are found at the southern edge of Sunset Park in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I asked Lam to tell me what I should look for if I wanted to find a sweatshop , he laughed and said , " Look anywhere . " In front of one building , we saw two women carrying a heavy load in a brown sack . Lam identified the load as clothes that had been sewn in someone 's home , or homework , which is illegal . In front of another building , a truck was parked and men were unloading boxes of plastic hangers . <p> Liang 's sentence had just been handed down a few days earlier and I wanted to see some of his factories , a project that turned out to be more complicated than I had anticipated . At one point , to try to help me understand the whole tangle , Lam pulled out a piece of scrap paper  --  a flyer announcing a picket of a new Donna Karan store . ( The flyer accused Donna Karan of using sweatshop labor in New York to manufacture $6,000 dresses , an allegation DKNY denies . ) On the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with dates and names and arrows pointing in various directions . One of Liang 's factories had changed its name at least twice , and another had three different addresses in a matter of just a few years , all within five blocks of one another . <p> To avoid giving Liang any ammunition against him , Lam refused to go into any of the factories Liang had operated or that he suspected him of operating still . But he did agree to show me where they were . In one case I got as far as the building 's entryway , which was being used to store bags of shirred fabric in pink-and-purple plaid . In a corner , there was a shrine with a statue of Confucius and an offering of oranges . A heavy curtain covered the entrance to the factory floor . Almost as soon as I lifted it , an elderly man came toward me uttering what I took to be imprecations in Chinese . <p> Walking down the street , I tried , more or less at random , the doors of nearly a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows  --  or , more precisely , by the lack of them . Some of the doors were locked ; the rest opened into rooms filled with piles of precut fabric , and rows and rows of women hunched over sewing machines . I realized that I had probably walked by dozens of similar shops before without noticing them , which is , of course , exactly what Lam is talking about . <p> For decades , New York 's garment factories <p> Drawn their workforce from the constant stream of new immigrants to Chinatown . <p> By Elizabeth Kolbert <p> Photographs by Chien-Chi Chang , Magnum <p>
