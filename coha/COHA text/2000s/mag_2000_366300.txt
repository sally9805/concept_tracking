A mix of politics and cash ... <P>  --  THE ARMS DEALER : Karlheinz Schreiber , shown at right , is fighting extradition from Canada to Germany . He has given millions of dollars to senior officials of the C.D.U . <P>  --  THE OFFICIAL : Ludwig-Holger Pfahls , former head of the counterespionage service , vanished after allegedly taking kickbacks <P>  --  THE TREASURER : Walther Leisler Kiep 's confession that money was placed in secret bank accounts led to the current scandal <P>  --  THE BUSINESSMAN : Frenchman Andre Guelfi , 80 , nicknamed Dede the Sardine , said he gave C.D.U . officials nearly $40 million to help win a contract <P> ... has trashed the C.D.U ... <P>  --  THE SUCCESSOR : Wolfgang Schauble has admitted he took cash from arms dealer Schreiber . But the party is sticking by Schauble for now . One theory : it will wait till the scandal 's end to dump him <P> ... and raised a cry for new leadership <P> As Germans contemplate their political future with the opposition Christian Democratic Union in meltdown mode over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has begun to turn to possible alternative leaders . Wolfgang Schauble , 57 , the party chairman , offered to resign last week but was overruled by the party leadership . <P> Perhaps the leading candidate to replace Schauble at the moment is Christian Wulff , 40 , an attorney who is the party 's deputy chairman . Wulff is telegenic and one of the leaders of the " Jungen Wilden , " the Young Wild Ones , a group of up-and-coming , fortysomething local politicians in the C.D.U . Wulff was an early critic of former Chancellor Helmut Kohl 's , even trying to block Kohl from running for a fifth term in 1998 . " The C.D.U . does not accept that anybody puts himself outside the legal system , " Wulff said last week , referring to Kohl 's refusal to name the source of illegal contributions to the party . A big liability for Wulff is that he is the C.D.U . ' s party leader in Lower Saxony , home of the current Chancellor , Gerhard Schroder . In the last election in Lower Saxony , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Another Young Wild One with a chance of succeeding Schauble is Peter Muller , 44 , a former judge from the Saarland , Germany 's coal belt . Unlike Wulff , Muller has a successful track record against the Social Democrats , having led his party to victory in state elections last September . But Muller joined the chorus against Kohl relatively recently , raising credibility questions . <P> One possible successor to Schauble is not young at all . Kurt Biedenkopf , prime minister of Saxony , is a white-haired 70-year-old . What Biedenkopf lacks in youth , however , he makes up with credentials : he was an early and outspoken critic of Kohl 's autocratic domination of the party . While that was considered a liability with Kohl in power , Biedenkopf now stands out as the party 's conscience , in much the same way Jimmy Carter appeared so attractive to an American electorate revolted by the Watergate affair . <P>  --  By Charles P.
