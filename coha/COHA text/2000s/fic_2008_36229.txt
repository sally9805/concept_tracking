Frank Temple III walked out of the county jail at ten in the morning with a headache , a citation for public intox , and a notion that it was time to leave town . <br> It was n't the arrest that convinced him . That had been merely a nightcap to an evening of farewells  --  Frank hanging from the streetlamp outside of Nick 's on Kirkwood Avenue , looking down into the face of a bored cop who 'd seen too many drunks and saying , " Officer , I 'd like to report a missing pair of pants . " <br> It had n't been the hours in the detox cell , either . Frank was one of six in the cell , and one of just two who managed not to vomit . Sitting with his backagainst the cold concrete block wall listening to some poor son of a bitch retch in the corner , Frank considered the jail , the people who checked in and did n't check out the next morning , the way he would . He considered the harsh fluorescent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality of the air , the hard looks the men inside developed to hide the hopelessness . It would be the same when the sun rose as when it set , except you would n't be sure when that happened , could n't even use the sun to gauge the lack of change . He considered all of that , and knew that if he could understand only one thing about his father , it was the decision he 'd made to avoid this place . <br> This was the second time Frank had been in a jail . The first was for a drunk driving charge in a small North Carolina town two years earlier . He had failed the Breathalyzer but requested field sobriety testing anyhow , his booze- addled brain sure that he could pass . After watching Frank stumble and stagger through the first exercise , the cop put an end to it , said , " Does n't look like your balance is too good , kid . " Frank , leaning against the car for support , had waved him closer , as if about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cop leaned down , and when he was close enough , Frank whispered , " Inner ear infection . " <br> He had the cuffs on and was in the back of the car before he was finished explaining the connection between one 's sinuses and one 's balance . His was not a receptive audience . <br> So this was the second trip to a jail , and even if his father had n't found a coward 's way to avoid a life sentence , the number would be the same . Frank would n't have visited . But he also could n't hide the thought , listening to those drunks mumble and belch and vomit beside him , that maybe the reason he put himself in situations like this was because he wanted a taste . Just a taste , that was all , something he could walk back into the free world with and think  --  that 's what it would 've been like for him . <br> He 'd been chased into the night of drinking by one disturbing phone message and one pretentious professor . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't heard in many years . <br> Frank , it 's Ezra . Ezra Ballard . Been a long time , has n't it ? You sound older on your message . Anyhow , I 'm calling because , well . . . he 's coming back , Frank . I just got a call from Florida telling me to open up the cabin . Now , I 'm not telling you to do anything , do n't even care if you call me back . I 'm just keeping my word , right ? Just keeping my word , son . He 's coming back , and now I 've told you . <br> Frank had n't returned the call . He intended to let it go . Knew that he should , at least . By the end of the day , though , he was done in Bloomington . A single semester of school  --  his fifth college in seven years , no degree achieved or even threatened  --  and Frank was done again . He 'd come here to work with a writer named Walter Thorp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them for it ) , whose work Frank had admired for years . Bloomington was closer to home than Frank had allowed himself to come in years , but Thorp was a visiting professor , there for only one semester , and he could n't pass up that chance . It had gone well , too . Thorp was good , better even than Frank had expected , and Frank had worked his ass off for a few months . Read like crazy , wrote like crazy , saw good things happening on the page . The last week of the semester brought an e-mail from Thorp , requesting a meeting , and Frank used that as encouragement to push Ezra Ballard 's call out of his mind . Focus on the future , do n't drown in the past . <br> <p> That was his mantra when he went to the cramped office on the third floor of Sycamore Hall , sat there and listened as Thorp , glancing occasionally at that gold watch he always wore on the inside of his wrist , complimented Frank 's writing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the semester , that Frank clearly had " powerful stories to tell . " Frank nodded and thanked his way through it , feeling good , validated in his decision to come here , to ignore that phone call . <br> " I 've never done this for a student before , " Thorp said , arching an eyebrow , " but I 'd like to introduce you to my agent . " <br> Frank could n't even feel the elation yet ; this was that much of a surprise . Just looked back at Thorp and did n't speak , waited to see what else would be said . <br> " In fact , " Thorp added , tracing the edge of his desk with a fingertip , eyes away from Frank 's , " I 've already mentioned you to him a few times . He 's interested . Very interested . But he was wondering  --  we both were , really  --  have you ever given thought to writing nonfiction ? Maybe a memoir ? " <br> Frank got it then . He felt his jaw tighten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old- fashioned window behind Thorp 's head and wondered what the great writer would look like flying through it , landing on the terrace three floors below . <br> " I only ask because your story , and the way it intersects with your father 's story , well , it could be quite compelling . To have that in addition to your own narrative gifts , Frank , is quite a package . Nate  --  he 's my agent  --  he thinks the market would be fantastic . You might even be able to get a deal on just a synop and a few sample chapters . Nate thinks an auction would be possible , and that 's the sort of circumstance where the dollar figures can go through the  --  " <br> He had the good sense not to follow Frank out the door and down the steps . Ten hours later , Frank was in the jail , all the amusement left in his drunken mind vanishing when the booking officer looked up from the paperwork and said , " No middle name ? " <br> Nope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your middle name was an easy thing  --  provided you had one . But he did n't . Just that Roman numeral tacked on the end , Frank Temple III , the next step in the legacy , a follow- up act to two war heroes and one murderer . <br> They 'd put him into the detox cell then , left him there to wait for sobriety , left him with swirling thoughts of his father and Thorp and the message . Oh , yes , the message . He 'd deleted it , but there would be no need to play it again anyhow . It was trapped in his brain , cycled through a dozen times as he sat awake waiting for morning . <br> He 's coming back . <br> He was not allowed to come back . Frank and Ezra had promised one another that , agreed that they 'd let him live out his days down there in Miami so long as he never tried to return , but now there was this phone call from Ezra saying that after seven years the son of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that old bluff . <br> All right , then . If he would return , then so would Frank . <p> He was northbound by noon , the Jeep loaded with his possessions . Except loaded was n't the right word , because Frank always traveled light so he could pack fast . The quicker he packed , the easier it was to ignore his father 's guns . He did n't want them , never had . Through nineteen states and who knew how many towns in the last seven years , though , they 'd traveled with him . Other than the guns , he had a laptop computer , two suitcases full of clothes , and a pile of books and CDs thrown into a cardboard box . Twenty- five years of life , it seemed like he should have more than that , but Frank had stopped accumulating things a long time ago . It was better to be able to move on without being burdened by a lot of objects that reminded you only of where you 'd just been . <br> West through Illinois before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always blanketed Chicago , then across the state line and into Wisconsin as the sun disappeared , the destination still hours ahead . Tomahawk , a name Frank would 've dismissed as clichT if he 'd written it for a North Woods lake town . The town was real enough , though , and so were his memories of it . <br> His father would n't be there . Devin Matteson would be . If Ezra 's call was legitimate , then Devin was returning for the first time in seven years . And if Frank had an ounce of sense , he 'd be driving in the opposite direction . What lay ahead , a confrontation with Devin , was the sort of possibility that Grady Morgan had warned him he had to avoid . Grady was one of the FBI agents who 'd brought down Frank 's father . Grady was also a damn good man . Frank had been close to him for a while , as close as he had been to anyone for a few months during the worst of it , but then the media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind . They had n't talked much since . <br> He drove past Madison in the dark and pushed on . He had n't eaten all day , just drank Gatorade and swallowed ibuprofen and drove , hoping to do it all in one stretch , with just a few stops for gas and to exercise sore muscles . Before he reached Stevens Point , though , he knew he was n't going to make it . The hangover had killed his appetite , but he 'd needed food if he was going to stay awake , and now the fatigue was beginning to overpower him . There was a rest stop ahead , maybe the last one he 'd see for a while , and he pulled off and parked . Lowered the driver 's seat as far as it would go , enough to let his legs stretch a bit , and then he slept . <p> It was a Big Brother kind of thing , no doubt about it , but Grady Morgan had kept an active monitor on Frank Temple III for seven years . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no role whatsoever in anything that could still be considered an active investigation for Grady . But nobody had noticed or cared or commented yet , and as long as they did n't , he 'd keep watching . Without a touch of remorse . He owed the kid at least this much . <br> The feelers Grady had out there in the world , computers that ran daily checks on Frank 's fingerprints and Social Security number , had been quiet for a long time . As had the phone lines and the e-mails and the mailbox . No word from Frank in quite a while , and there were times when Grady ached to speak to him , check in , but he did n't . He just went to work every day and eyed the calendar that showed retirement was not far away and hoped that Frank would continue to stay off the radar screen . Grady did n't want to see a blip . <br> Here was one . The wrong kind of blip , too , an arrest in Indiana , and when it first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swirl go through his stomach , and he actually looked away from the screen for a moment , not wanting to read the details . <br> " Shit , Frank , " he muttered . " Do n't do this to me . " <br> Then he sighed and rubbed a forehead that was always growing , chasing the gray hair right off his skull , and he turned back to the computer screen and read the details of the arrest . When he got through , he let out a breath of relief . Public intoxication . That was it . The second arrest in seven years , the second time Grady had felt this chill of sorrow , and the second time he could roll his eyes and chalk it up as No Big Deal , Kids Being Kids . <br> He hoped . <br> As he pushed back from his desk and walked to the window and looked out at the Chicago skyline , he sent a silent request to Frank Temple III somewhere out there across the miles . <br> Tell me it was just fun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some buddies having beers and chasing girls and laughing like idiots , like happy , happy idiots . Tell me that there was no fight involved , no temper , no violence , not even a closed fist . You 've made it a long way . <br> A long , long way . <br> Frank III had been eighteen years old when Grady met him . A slender , good- looking kid with dark features contrasted by bright blue eyes , and a maturity that Grady had n't seen in a boy of that age before , so utterly cool that Grady actually asked a psychologist for advice on talking to him . He 's showing nothing , Grady had said . Every report we 've got says he was closer to his father than anyone , and he is showing nothing . <br> He showed something in the third interview . It had been just him and Grady sitting in the Temple living room , and Grady , desperate for some way to get the kid talking , had pointed at a framed photograph of father and son on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to play ? <br> The kid had sat there and looked at him and seemed almost amused . Then he 'd said , You want to know what he taught me ? Stand up . <br> So Grady stood up . When the kid said , Take that pen and try it to touch to my heart . Hell , try to touch it anywhere . Pretend it 's a knife , Grady had n't wanted to . All of a sudden this was seeming like a real bad idea , but the kid 's eyes were intense , and so Grady said what the hell and made one quick thrust , thinking he 'd lay the pen against the kid 's chest and be done with it . <br> The speed . Oh , man , the speed . The kid 's hands had moved faster than anybody 's Grady had ever seen , trapped his wrist and rolled it back and the pen was pointing at Grady 's throat in a heartbeat 's time . <br> Half- assed effort , Frank Temple III had said . Try again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried again . And again , and again , and by the end he was working into a sweat and no longer fooling around , was beginning to feel the flush of shame because this was a child , damn it , and Grady had done eight years in the Army and another fifteen in the Bureau and he ran twenty miles a week and lifted weights and he could beat this kid <br> But he could n't . When he finally gave up , the kid had smiled at him , this horribly genuine smile , and said , Want to see me shoot ? <br> Yes , Grady said . <br> What he saw at the range later that afternoon  --  a tight and perfect cluster of bullets  --  no longer surprised him . <br> Seven years later , he was thinking about that day while he stared out of the window and told himself that it was nothing but a public intox charge , a silly misdemeanor , and that there was nothing to worry about with Frank . Frank was a good kid , always had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stayed away from a certain kind of trouble . <br> That was all he needed to do . Stay away from that kind of trouble . <p> <br> Continues ...
