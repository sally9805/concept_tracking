<p> Fox Sports President Ed Goren woke up Monday morning , turned on the TV to check out the stock market and could n't believe what he was hearing . <p> He tuned to CNBC , but instead of listening to analysts discuss stocks , bonds and the futures market , anchor Mark Haines was moaning about the New York Mets ' collapse . Then he was talking to a CEO in Illinois gushing about the Chicago Cubs . <p> Who wants to talk stocks when you can address the New York Yankees ' postseason rotation ? " It 's amazing , " Goren says , recalling that morning . " All anyone 's doing is talking baseball . Oh , and by the way , the market is at an all-time high . It 's wonderful . " <p> Major League Baseball , which drew a record 79.5 million fans this year with perhaps its most dramatic regular-season weekend since the advent of the wild card , is poised to conquer the world . The postseason tournament starts today with three best-of-five Division Series ; a fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is scheduled to open Thursday . <p> " This sport , " Commissioner Bud Selig says , " is the most popular it 's ever been . It has been our national pastime . It still is our national pastime . It always will be our national pastime . " <p> Especially with this postseason 's contenders , who have a chance to dominate the headlines , talk shows and , most important , TV ratings for all of October . <p> " I could never have imagined this type of momentum going into the postseason , " says Turner Sports President David Levy , whose TBS cable network showed the Colorado Rockies ' dramatic win against the San Diego Padres on Monday to make the postseason and will carry all first-round games and the National League Championship Series . " This postseason , with the teams involved we have , is an absolute dream for a network . " <p> For the first time , baseball will have five of the top seven markets represented in the playoffs . They also have the Yankees , Philadelphia Phillies and Boston Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Midwest and the Rockies , Los Angeles Angels and Arizona Diamondbacks for the West . <p> " This is such a baseball marketing dream , it 's almost like it was fixed . It 's unreal , " Minnesota center fielder Torii Hunter says , laughing . " Can you imagine the TV ratings ? It 's going to be crazy . You 're talking about Cub fans all over the country . You got America 's team , the Yankees . You got the Red Sox Nation . You got the underdogs like Cleveland . <p> " I ca n't wait to sit back on my couch and watch it . I want to see good commercials , too , like the Super Bowl . Do n't give me any punk commercials . Show me the kind that has everyone talking like the Super Bowl ones . " <p> Entwined in the culture <p> MLB actually has been creating its version of YouTube , named " actober , " with fans and stars , such as James Caan and Survivor host Jeff Probst re-enacting dramatic postseason moments in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Probst impersonated Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter and former major leaguers Bobby Thomson and Kirk Gibson in a video . <p> " Our fans tell us that baseball has a greater cultural historical significance than any other sport , " says Tim Brosnan , MLB executive vice president of business . " If you take a momentous event in life , whether marriage , the birth of your child , your first job , and relate it to a sports event , nine out of 10 people will give you a baseball game . <p> " The 2001 postseason is my favorite of all time because everybody who lives in New York had friends , relatives or a neighbor that was impacted by 9/11 . I really believe that baseball and the postseason played a pretty strong role in helping what was a difficult recovery . That will always be special to me . " <p> This time , instead of helping a nation recover , the postseason could mend plenty of broken hearts . The Cubs have not won the World Series in 99 years . The Indians last won in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drought in baseball , have n't won a World Series in 27 years . The Rockies have never made it to a World Series . <p> And if you talk to Yankees fans , seven years seems like an eternity . <p> " We 're the underdog , " Cubs President John McDonough says . " Come on , it 's been 99 years . We lost 96 games last year . How can you be a bigger underdog than that ? " <p> Are the Cubs really baseball 's Cinderella team ? <p> " Nah , " Goren says . " There 's one good reason . ( Cubs manager Lou ) Piniella does n't look good in glass slippers . " <p> The Cubs , America 's lovable losers , figure to hog the spotlight as long as they 're in the postseason . <p> Everyone again will hear about the curse of the billy goat . <p> The black cat that darted in front of their dugout in 1969 . <p> And , yes , news organizations will try to track down Steve Bartman , the fan who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NLCS , perhaps costing the Cubs a shot at the World Series . <p> " I do n't want to sound presumptuous and say what 's good for the Cubs is good for baseball , " says McDonough , who has spent 24 years in the organization , " but from a TV ratings standpoint , it 's seismic . The Cubs are a significant attraction . Everyone , it seems , can relate to us . <p> " We 've had the same logo for 80 years . Played in the same ballpark for 93 years . We 've been on the same TV station for 60 years . The same radio station for 70 years . People have become accustomed to these things . And because of the ticking clock syndrome , we 've always been the underdog . " <p> Levy says the inclusion of the Cubs could make this a cherished postseason with sky-high ratings . For the regular season , viewership was up 25% on ESPN and 13% on ESPN2 . It was down 4% on Fox , but 20 of the 29 U.S. markets with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MLB research . <p> " I knew before the year started that baseball is in an up-cycle , " Levy says , " but what we 're seeing now is people excited about the postseason before it even happens . This could n't have worked out any better . " <p> Wild finish <p> As late as last Thursday , eight NL teams were vying for four spots , with the possibility of a five-way tie . There could have been a four-way tie involving two divisional titles and a wild card as late as Sunday . The Phillies did n't know until Monday night they were playing the Rockies . <p> No wonder Selig got excited last weekend listening to Phillies President David Montgomery fondly recall the 1994 day they announced the addition of a wild-card entrant in each league . <p> " Commissioner , when we decided to go with all of this , did you ever believe it could be this good ? Did you ever ? " Montgomery asked Selig . <p> " We have numbers today that nobody could ever have thought about , including me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local TV ratings . Our national ratings . The amount of interest is legendary . This business is hitting on all cylinders . <p> " Just to see what happened in New York , what happened in Philadelphia , in Colorado and San Diego , is just fascinating . If somebody wrote this plot , nobody would have believed it . " <p> Who would have imagined just three months ago that the Yankees and Cubs would be in the playoffs and the Mets and Milwaukee Brewers would be sitting home ? Or that the Diamondbacks , without Randy Johnson , would win the NL West ? Or that the Phillies would overcome a seven-game deficit with 21/2 weeks left to win the NL East ? <p> " This last week has been as exciting as any I 've seen in sports , " says Jeff Moorad , Diamondbacks chief executive officer . " Now we have tremendous excitement and build-up towards the postseason . The fact that markets across the country  --  big and small  --  are represented in the postseason is a testimony to the commissioner 's grand plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitive balance might be reflected in the division series , where there is no heavy favorite or huge underdog . <p> " What 's really intriguing is not only with the markets involved , " HBO host Bob Costas says , " but that all of the teams in the American League are good enough to get to the World Series and none of the National League 's are so good that none have a chance . <p> " I ca n't see any series where there is a prohibitive favorite until the World Series , where the American League would be favored because it is clearly superior to the National League . " <p> Yet the Yankees and Cubs have defied the odds by simply making it to the postseason . Both , thought to be out of it in June , resurrected into contenders . <p> " They went through the same kind of hell to get here , " Goren says . " The two veteran managers ( Piniella and the Yankees ' Joe Torre ) held up stoically while everyone around them was panicking . Now after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In typical Cubs fashion , it was perfect . " <p> Although the perfect culmination of this baseball season might be a World Series between these teams , Goren says the ultimate drama would be a showdown between the Cubs and Red Sox . <p> " Now that the Red Sox have won , " Goren says , " the Cubs are the missing piece . <p> " We 're in the middle of football ( on Sunday ) , and someone says , ' Would n't it be great to see the Red Sox and Cubs in the World Series ? ' I turned around and said , ' If that happened , what would I have left in life ? ' I would have to retire . You want that at some point , but do you want all of that now ? <p> " And then , " Goren says , " there are some sick people that can see the Red Sox and Cubs go down to the ninth inning of Game 7 , something goes wrong and the World Series is canceled . <p> " Could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> OBJECT = c1scov03 IB01CUBSmain03.jpg03 IB01JETER203.jpg03 IB02SHILLING03.jpg03 c02angelsjump03.jpg03 <p> # Find Documents with Similar Topics Below are concepts discussed in this document .
