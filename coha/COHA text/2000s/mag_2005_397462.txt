Section : Health FIGHTING ANOREXIA The age of their youngest patients has slipped to 9 years old , and doctors have begun to research the roots of this disease . Anorexia is probably hard-wired , the new thinking goes , and the best treatment is a family affair . <p> EMILY KRUDYS CAN PINPOINT the moment her life fell apart . It was a fall afternoon in the Virginia suburbs , and she was watching her daughter Katherine perform in the school play . Katherine had always been a happy girl , a slim beauty with a megawatt smile , but recently , her mother noticed , she 'd been losing weight . " She 's battling a virus , " Emily kept on telling herself , but there , in the darkened auditorium , she could no longer deny the truth . Under the floodlights , Katherine looked frail , hollow-eyed and gaunt . At that moment , Emily had to admit to herself that her daughter had a serious eating disorder . Katherine was 10 years old . <p> Who could help their daughter get better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark , would ask themselves repeatedly over the next five weeks , growing increasingly frantic as Katherine 's weight slid from 48 to 45 pounds . In the weeks after the school play , Katherine put herself on a brutal starvation diet , and no one  --  not the school psychologist , the private therapist , the family pediatrician or the high-powered internist  --  could stop her . Emily and Mark tried everything . They were firm . Then they begged their daughter to eat . Then they bribed her . We 'll buy you a pony , they told her . But nothing worked . At dinnertime , Katherine ate portions that could be measured in tablespoons . " When I demanded that she eat some food  --  any food  --  she 'd just shut down , " Emily recalls . By Christmas , the girl was so weak she could barely leave the couch . A few days after New Year 's , Emily bundled her eldest child into the car and rushed her to the emergency room , where she was immediately put on IV . Home again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It took one more hospitalization for the Krudyses to finally make the decision they now believe saved their daughter 's life . Last February , they enrolled her in a residential clinic halfway across the country in Omaha , Neb.  --  one of the few facilities nationwide that specialize in young children with eating disorders . Emily still blames herself for not acting sooner . " It was right in front of me , " she says , " but I just did n't realize that children could get an eating disorder this young . " <p> Most parents would forgive Emily Krudys for not believing her own eyes . Anorexia nervosa , a mental illness defined by an obsession with food and acute anxiety over gaining weight , has long been thought to strike teens and young women on the verge of growing up  --  not kids performing in the fourth-grade production of " The Pig 's Picnic . " But recently researchers , clinicians and mental-health specialists say they 're seeing the age of their youngest anorexia patients decline to 9 from 13 . Administrators at Arizona 's Remuda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many calls from parents of young children that last year , they launched a program for kids 13 years old and under ; so far , they 've treated 69 of them . Six months ago the eating-disorder program at Penn State began to treat the youngest ones , too  --  20 of them so far , some as young as 8 . Elementary schools in Boston , Manhattan and Los Angeles are holding seminars for parents to help them identify eating disorders in their kids , and the parents , who have watched Mary-Kate Olsen morph from a child star into a rail-thin young woman , are all too ready to listen . <p> At a National Institute of Mental Health conference last spring , anorexia 's youngest victims were a small part of the official agenda  --  but they were the only thing anyone talked about in the hallways , says David S. Rosen , a clinical faculty member at the University of Michigan and an eating-disorder specialist . Seven years ago " the idea of seeing a 9- or 10-year-old anorexic would have been shocking and prompted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids this age all the time , " Rosen says . There 's no single explanation for the declining age of onset , although greater awareness on the part of parents certainly plays a role . Whatever the reason , these littlest patients , combined with new scientific research on the causes of anorexia , are pushing the clinical community  --  and families , and victims  --  to come up with new ways of thinking about and treating this devastating disease . <p> Not many years ago , the conventional wisdom held that adolescent girls " got " anorexia from the culture they lived in . Intense young women , mostly from white , wealthy families , were overwhelmed by pressure to be perfect from their suffocating parents , their demanding schools , their exacting coaches . And so they chose extreme dieting as a way to control their lives , to act out their frustration at never being perfect enough . In the past decade , though , psychiatrists have begun to see surprising diversity among their anorexic patients . Not only are anorexia 's victims younger , they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more likely to be boys , more likely to be middle-aged . All of which caused doctors to question their core assumption : if anorexia is n't a disease of type-A girls from privileged backgrounds , then what is it ? <p> Although no one can yet say for certain , new science is offering tantalizing clues . Doctors now compare anorexia to alcoholism and depression , potentially fatal diseases that may be set off by environmental factors such as stress or trauma , but have their roots in a complex combination of genes and brain chemistry . In other words , many kids are affected by pressure-cooker school environments and a culture of thinness promoted by magazines and music videos , but most of them do n't secretly scrape their dinner into the garbage . The environment " pulls the trigger , " says Cynthia Bulik , director of the eating-disorder program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill . But it 's a child 's latent vulnerabilities that " load the gun . " <p> Parents do play a role , but most often it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies of anorexics have shown that the disease often runs in families . In a 2000 study published in The American Journal of Psychiatry , researchers at Virginia Commonwealth University studied 2,163 female twins and found that 77 of them suffered from symptoms of anorexia . By comparing the number of identical twins who had anorexia with the significantly smaller number of fraternal twins who had it , scientists concluded that more than 50 percent of the risk for developing the disorder could be attributed to an individual 's genetic makeup . A few small studies have even isolated a specific area on the human genome where some of the mutations that may influence anorexia exist , and now a five-year , $10 million NIMH study is underway to further pinpoint the locations of those genes . <p> AMY NELSON , 14 , A NINTH grader from a Chicago suburb , thinks that genes played a role in her disease . Last year Amy 's weight dropped from 105 to a skeletal 77 pounds , and her parents enrolled her in the day program at the Alexian Brothers Behavioral Health Hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting better , her father found the diary of his younger sister , who died at 18 of " unknown causes . " In it , the teenager had calculated that she could lose 13 pounds in less than a month by restricting herself to less than 600 calories a day . No salt , no butter , no sugar , " not too many bananas , " she wrote in 1980 . " Depression can run in families , " says Amy , " and an eating disorder is like depression . It 's something wrong with your brain . " These days , Amy is healthier and , though she does n't weigh herself , thinks she 's around 100 . She has a part in the school play and is more casual about what she eats , even to the point of enjoying ice cream with friends . <p> Scientists are tracking important differences in the brain chemistry of anorexics . Using brain scans , researchers at the University of Pittsburgh , led by professor of psychiatry Dr. Walter Kaye , discovered that the level of serotonin activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal levels of serotonin are believed to be associated with feelings of well-being , these pumped-up levels of hormones may be linked to feelings of anxiety and obsessional thinking , classic traits of anorexia . Kaye hypothesizes that anorexics use starvation as a mode of self-medication . How ? Starvation prevents tryptophane , an essential amino acid that produces serotonin , from getting into the brain . By eating less , anorexics reduce the serotonin activity in their brains , says Kaye , " creating a sense of calm , " even as they are about to die of malnutrition . <p> Almost everyone knows someone who has trouble with food : extremely picky eating , obsessive dieting , body-image problems , even voluntary vomiting are well known . But in the spectrum of eating disorders , anorexia , which affects about 2.5 million Americans , stands apart . For one thing , anorexics are often delusional . They can be weak with hunger while they describe physical sensations of overfullness that make it physically uncomfortable for them to swallow . They hear admonishing voices in their heads when they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compulsively , and even when they can count their ribs , their image in the mirror tells them to lose more . <p> When 12-year-old Erin Phillips , who lives outside Baltimore , was in her downward spiral , she stopped eating butter , then started eating with chopsticks , then refused solid food altogether , says her mother , Joann . Within two months , Erin 's weight had slipped from 70 to 50 pounds . " Every day , I 'd watch her melt away , " Joann says . Before it struck her daughter , Joann had been dismissive about the disease . " I used to think the person should just eat something and get over it . But when you see it up close , you ca n't believe your eyes . They just ca n't . " ( Her confusion is natural : the term anorexia comes from a Greek word meaning " loss of appetite . " ) <p> Anorexia is a killer  --  it has the highest mortality rate of any mental illness , including depression . About half of anorexics get better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain chronically ill  --  exhausting , then bankrupting , parents , retreating from jobs and school , alienating friends as they struggle to manage the symptoms of their condition . Hannah Hartney of Tulsa , Okla. , was first hospitalized with anorexia when she was 10 . After eight weeks , she was returned to her watchful parents . For the last few years , she was able to maintain a normal weight but now , at 16 , she 's been battling her old demons again . " She 's not out of the woods , " says her mother , Kathryn . <p> While adults can drift along in a state of semi-starvation for years , the health risks for children under the age of 13 are dire . In their preteen years , kids should be gaining weight . During that critical period , their bones are thickening and lengthening , their hearts are getting stronger in order to pump blood to their growing bodies and their brains are adding mass , laying down new neurological pathways and pruning others  --  part of the explosion of mental and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with eating disorders stop consuming sufficient calories , their bodies begin to conserve energy : heart function slows , blood pressure drops ; they have trouble staying warm . Whatever estrogen or testosterone they have in their bodies drops . The stress hormone cortisol becomes elevated , preventing their bones from hardening . Their hair becomes brittle and falls out in patches . Their bodies begin to consume muscle tissue . The brain , which depends at least in part on dietary fat to grow , begins to atrophy . Unlike adult anorexics , children with eating disorders can develop these debilitating symptoms within months . <p> Lori Cornwell says her son 's descent was horrifyingly fast . In the summer of 2004 , 9-year-old Matthew Cornwell of Quincy , Ill. , weighed a healthy 49 pounds . Always a picky eater , he began restricting his food intake until all he would eat was a carrot smeared with a tablespoon of peanut butter . Within three months , he was down to 39 pounds . When the Cornwells and their doctor finally located a clinic that would accept a 10-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back seat of her car and drove all night across the country . Matthew was barely conscious when he arrived at the Children 's Hospital in Omaha . " I knew that I had to get there before he slipped away , " she says . <p> With stakes this high , how do you treat a malnourished third grader who is so ill she insists five Cheerios make a meal ? First , say a growing number of doctors and patients , you have to let parents back into the treatment process . For more than a hundred years , parents have been regarded as an anorexic 's biggest problem , and in 1978 , in her book " Golden Cage , " psychoanalyst Hilde Bruch suggested that narcissistic , cold and unloving parents ( or , alternatively , hypercritical , overambitious and overinvolved ones ) actually caused the disease by discouraging their children 's natural maturation to adulthood . Thirty years ago standard treatment involved helping the starving and often delusional adolescents or young women to separate psychologically  --  and sometimes physically  --  from their toxic parents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Dr. Ellen Rome , head of adolescent medicine at the Cleveland Clinic . <p> Too often these days , parents are n't so much banished from the treatment process as sidelined , watching powerlessly as doctors take what can be extreme measures to make their children well . In hospitals , severely malnourished anorexics are treated with IV drips and nasogastric tubes . In long-term residential treatment centers , an anorexic 's food intake is weighed and measured , bite by bite . In individual therapy , an anorexic tries to uncover the roots of her obsession and her resistance to treatment . Most doctors use a combination of these approaches to help their patients get better . Although parents are no longer overtly blamed for their child 's condition , says Marlene Schwartz , codirector of the Yale eating-disorder clinic , doctors and therapists " give parents the impression that eating disorders are something the parents did that the doctors are now going to fix . " <p> Worse , the state-of-the-art protocols do n't work for many young children . A prolonged stay in a hospital or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some kids , but many others are too young for it to be effective . Back at home , family mealtimes become a nightmare . Parents , advised not to badger their child about food , say nothing  --  and then they watch helpless and heartbroken as their child pushes the food away . <p> In the last three years , some prominent hospitals and clinics around the country have begun adopting a new treatment model in which families help anorexics get better . The most popular of the home-based models , the Maudsley approach , was developed in the 1980s at the Maudsley Hospital in London . Two doctors there noticed that when severely malnourished , treatment-resistant anorexics were put in the hospital and fed by nurses , they gradually gained weight and began to participate in their own recovery . They decided that given the right support , family members could get anorexics to eat in the same way the nurses did . These days , family-centered therapy works like this : A team of doctors , therapists and nutritionists meets with parents and the child . The team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a severe , life-threatening disease like cancer or diabetes . Food , the family is told , is the medicine that will help the child get better . Like oncologists prescribing chemotherapy , the team provides parents with a schedule of calories , lipids , carbohydrates and fiber that the patient must eat every day and instructs them on how to monitor the child 's intake . It coaches siblings and other family members on how to become a sympathetic support team . After a few practice meals in the hospital or doctor 's office , the whole family is sent home for a meal . <p> " I told my daughter , ' You 're going to hate this ' , " says Mitzi Miles , whose daughter Kaleigh began struggling with anorexia at 10 . " She said , ' I could never hate you , Mom . ' And I said , ' We 'll see ' . " The first dinner at the Miles home outside Harrisburg , Pa. , was a battle  --  but Mitzi , convinced by Kaleigh 's doctor she was doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 45 minutes of yelling and crying , Kaleigh began to eat . Over the next 20 weeks , Kaleigh attended weekly therapy sessions , and Mitzi got support from the medical team , which instructed her to allow Kaleigh to make more food choices on her own . Eleven months later , Kaleigh is able to maintain a normal weight . Mitzi no longer measures out food portions or keeps a written log of her daily food intake . <p> CRITICS POINT OUT THAT THE Maudsley approach wo n't work well for adults who wo n't submit to other people 's making their food choices . And they charge that in some children , parental oversight can do more harm than good . Young anorexics and their parents are already locked in a battle for control , says Dr. Alexander Lucas , an eating-disorder specialist and professor emeritus at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota . The Maudsley approach , he says , " may backfire " by making meals into a battleground . " The focus on weight gain , " he says , " has to be between the physician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment is n't right for everyone : families where there is violence , sexual abuse , alcoholism or drug addiction are n't good candidates . But several studies both in clinics at the Maudsley Hospital and at the University of Chicago show promising results : five years after treatment , more than 70 percent of patients recover using the family-centered method , compared with 50 percent who recover by themselves or using the old approaches . Currently , a large-scale NIH study of the Maudsley approach is underway . <p> Mental-health specialists say the success of the family-centered approach is finally putting the old stigmas to rest . " An 8-year-old with anorexia is n't in a flight from maturity , " says Dr. Julie O'Toole , medical director of the Kartini Clinic in Portland , Ore. , a family-friendly eating-disorder clinic . " These young patients are fully in childhood . " Most young anorexics , O'Toole says , have wonderful , thoughtful , terribly worried parents . These days , when a desperately sick child enters the Kartini Clinic , O'Toole tries to set parents straight . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't choose to have it and parents do n't cause it . " Then she gives the parents a little pep talk . She reminds them that mothers were once blamed for causing schizophrenia and autism until that so-called science was debunked . And that the same will soon be true for anorexia . At the conclusion of O'Toole 's speech , she says , parents often weep . <p> Ironically , family dinners are one of the best ways to prevent a vulnerable child from becoming anorexic . Too often , dinner is eaten in the back seat of an SUV on the way to soccer practice . Parents who eat regular , balanced meals with their children model good eating practices . Family dinners also help parents spot any changes in their child 's eating habits . Dieting , says Dr. Craig Johnson , director of the eating-disorder program at Laureate Psychiatric Hospital in Tulsa , triggers complex neurobiological reactions . If you have anorexia in the family and your 11-year-old tells you she 's about to go on a diet and is thinking about joining the track team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful about how you approach her request . " For some kids , innocent-seeming behavior carries enormous risks . <p> Children predisposed to eating disorders are uniquely sensitive to media messages about dieting and health . And their interpretation can be starkly literal . When Ignatius Lau of Portland , Ore. , was 11 years old , he decided that 140 pounds was too much for his 5-foot-2 frame . He had heard that oils and carbohydrates were fattening , so he became obsessed with food labels , cutting out all fats and almost all carbs . He lost 32 pounds in six months and ended up in a local hospital . " I told myself I was eating healthier , " Ignatius says . He recovered , but for the next three years suffered frequent relapses . " I 'd lose weight again and it would trigger some of my old behaviors , like reading food labels , " he says . These days he knows what healthy feels like . Ignatius , now 17 , is 5 feet 11 , 180 pounds , and plays basketball . <p> Back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has changed . For two months Katherine stayed at the Omaha Children 's Hospital , and slowly gained weight . Emily stayed nearby  --  attending the weekly therapy sessions designed to help integrate her into Katherine 's treatment . After Katherine returned home , Emily home-schooled her while she regained her strength . This fall , Katherine entered sixth grade . She 's got the pony , and she 's become an avid horsewoman , sometimes riding five or six times a week . She 's still slight , but she 's gaining weight normally by eating three meals and three or four snacks a day . But the anxiety still lingers . When Katherine says she 's hungry , Emily has been known to drop everything and whip up a three-course meal . The other day she was startled to see her daughter spreading sour cream on her potato . " I thought , ' My God , that 's how regular kids eat all the time ' , " she recalls . Then she realized that her daughter was well on the way to becoming one of those kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 , Eldersburg , Maryland . By the time she was 10 , Erin had survived leukemia . But nothing prepared her or her family for what came next . Angry voices , she told her mother , were telling her not to eat  --  and she ended up in the hospital again . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Now Erin ( with her brother David , 14 , and sister , Caroline , 8 ) has gained weight and begun to eat normally .

Hannah says she feels fine and does n't agree that her old problem might be back . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Ignatius Lau , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 , Ignatius thought being skinny would ' make me more athletic , better at sports and more attractive .
