<p> The most indispensable photographs show us who we are the formal portraits of our great-grandparents as newly arrived immigrants and our own parents on their wedding day ; the candid snapshots of our youthful selves and of our own children at moments in time gone forever . They mean little to anyone whose life is not tied to the memories . <p> Pictures that teach us how to see are the next most indispensable photographs . William Carlos Williams wrote in his novel The Great American Novel that there is " nothing more wonderful than to see the pears attached by their stems to the trees . Earth , trunk , branch , twig and the fruit : a circle soon to be completed when the pear falls . " A perfectly seen photograph , such as Alfred Stieglitz 's Apple and Gable , Lake George , 1922 , is thus indispensable because it triggers the imagination and makes us appreciate something we might have ignored . It is " larger " than its subject . It gives meaning to life . Photography is the great American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and take a picture but because still photographs have the ability to help us see clearly and give value to things both great and small . <p> Indispensable photographs should not be confused with photographs of important historic events : the joining of the rails at Promontory Point ; the Wright brothers ' plane lifting off at Kitty Hawk ; the first man on the moon ; the horrors of Auschwitz , My Lai , and Kent State ; Ike rallying the troops on D-day ; Martin Luther King , Jr. , giving his " I Have a Dream " speech ; John F. Kennedy , Jr. , saluting his dead father . These images are part of our collective historical consciousness and are vitally significant , but their importance is inherent in the subjects they depict , not in the manner in which they frame moments in time . <p> Ten indispensable American photographs in chronological order : <p> Lewis Payne , by Alexander Gardner ( 1865 ) . Here is one of the first celebrity portraits . Payne was a criminal ; he had attempted to assassinate President Lincoln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hanged for his role in the plot . There were 10 conspirators ; Alexander Gardner photographed 8 of them , but Lewis Payne was the only one who knew how to play to the camera and use his good looks to seduce his contemporaries and every succeeding generation . The portrait of Payne is indispensable in reminding us that the camera can make celebrities out of both the worthy and the unworthy . The image is not the reality . <p> A Harvest of Death , Gettysburg , Pennsylvania , by Timothy O'Sullivan ( 1863 ) . This is one of the greatest war photographs . It is a eulogy to all who have fallen in battle , a meditation on life and death . It simultaneously honors the men by forever hallowing the ground on which they fell and presents their once-pulsating bodies as human debris , used and abused . This image makes sacred the sacrifice but shows there is no glory . <p> Running ( Galloping ) , by Eadweard Muybridge ( 1878-79 ) . William M. Ivins , Jr. , of the Metropolitan Museum of Art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that what was reasonable was true , and it would end up by believing that what it saw in a photograph of was true . " No group of photographs illustrates this arresting observation better than the human and animal locomotion studies Eadweard Muybridge made in the late 1870s and 1880s . Rebecca Solnit , in her brilliant recent book River of Shadows : Eadweard Muybridge and the Technological Wild West , describes this photographer as " the man who split the second , as dramatic and far-reaching an action as the splitting of the atom . " She continues : " He had begun transforming photography into a scientific instrument revealing the secret world of motion . The medium had started out far slower than the human eye .... It was now going to cross a great divide , to bring into visibility , as the telescope and microscope before it , a world hidden to the eye . " Muybridge 's cameras froze the most basic actions , and the impact of his pictures on art matched their impact on science . as such , was part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Head Cloth , Ellis Island , by Lewis Hine ( 1905 ) . A great portrait is supposed to be able to reveal the character , the essence , of the individual . Hine 's portrait of this unnamed young woman on the threshold of a new life reveals little about her except her ability to be totally in the moment - to proclaim , " I am here . " The marvel of this portrait is that one feels her courage without knowing anything of her past or her future . The photograph is homage to the individuality of each immigrant to our shores . <p> Pepper No. 30 , by Edward Weston ( 1930 ) . Edward Weston could turn a pepper into a monument . He transformed the most mundane subjects - a cabbage leaf , a piece of seaweed , a torso , a tree - into works of profound beauty and spirituality . But as Professor Alan Tractenberg reminds us in an essay on Weston , saying that a rock is " more than a rock " is ultimately an act of faith . It does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject as sublimely beautiful or as the equivalent of some spiritual force of nature . Once someone has seen a Weston photograph , he or she understands the camera to be a powerful tool for revealing form and detail , and it is difficult to again see any of his subjects - be they shells or carrots or kelp or sand dunes - in the same way . <p> Farmer 's Kitchen , Hale County , Alabama , by Walker Evans ( 1936 ) . In 1936 Fortune magazine assigned the writer James Agee and the photographer Walker Evans to collaborate on a series of articles about the daily lives of tenant farmers in the Deep South . Their work was subsequently published as a book with the title Let Us Now Praise Famous Men . Evans and Agee were unable to view these families as a " social problem " and saw dignity and grace where others saw poverty and squalor . No image challenges assumptions about quality of life more than Farmer 's Kitchen . A dishcloth hangs on a hook , as elegant as a fine piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as functional and as aesthetically pleasing as those broken vessels of ancient civilizations that grace museum showcases . Someone cared enough to place a simple , single bowl just so on a shelf before the open doorway . To Evans , this tenant family 's home has an inherent balance and grace , and he teaches us that the value we place on things comes from how we see , not how much they cost . <p> Mount Williamson , Sierra Nevada , From Manzanar , California , by Ansel Adams ( ca. 1944 ) . There are scores of indispensable nineteenth-century photographs of the American West . Photographs by Timothy O'Sullivan , William Henry Jackson , and others brought to the attention of Congress the necessity of preserving the wilderness . I choose the twentieth-century work Mount Williamson , by Adams , however , because millions of people saw it in the 1955 Museum of Modern Art exhibition The Family of Man and the book that followed . It was the first truly great landscape photograph many people experienced . Unlike most all pretty color pictures , Adams 's photograph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American spirit . <p> Trolley-New Orleans , by Robert Frank ( 1955-56 ) . Traveling around the United States on a Guggenheim fellowship in the mid-1950s , Robert Frank used his camera to capture the complexity and confusion within American society . Postwar prosperity did not mean all was well in the 48 states . Jack Kerouac wrote in his introduction to Frank 's book The Americans that the photographer " sucked a sad poem right out of America onto film . " Using his little camera , Frank captured the big issues facing Americans : alienation , isolation , integration , quality of life . Trolley - New Orleans is like a sad song telling us that no matter how different we seem to be from one another , whatever our particular woes are , we all are on a journey through time together , each of us occupying our own space but sharing a destiny and a destination . Kerouac said of Frank , " You got eyes , " and Frank 's eyes have helped us all to see . <p> Demonstrators Blasted Against a Doorway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1963 ) . Empathy . A great work of art can make the viewer feel the power , the pain , the positions of the subjects depicted . The pictures of the civil rights movement constitute a golden age of American photojournalism , a period when masterpieces of documentary photography were made that struck many hearts and changed many minds . The Charles Moore photograph from the Birmingham riots is a classic , like a frieze on a Grecian urn , and is as piercing as the jet of water from the firemen 's hose . It is indispensable because it exemplifies the emotional and political power of a great news photograph while teaching the importance of humanity . <p> Unfitted Film Still #48 , by Cindy Sherman ( 1979 ) . Cindy Sherman has produced a rich and complex body of images of herself , but they are not self-portraits . Her portraits tend to be " types " of women we recognize from movies and pictures and the grocery store but do n't really know at all . Sherman 's work , beginning with her seminal series Untitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture , fantasy , ego , and vulnerability . Her images remind us that photography , like life , is both fact and illusion . Her pictures , like all indispensable photographs , help us uncover what is real and what is not . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By Gail Buckland <p> <p> Gail Buckland is the author of Reality Recorded : Early Documentary Photography and is a coauthor , with Harold Evans , of They Made America : From the Steam Engine to the Search Engine - Two Centuries of Innovators . <p>
