Stepping into the Tornado " Change is like a storm , " Mama said gently . , " It 's all windy and upsetting , but the sun has to come out eventually . " She kissed my forehead and tried to smooth down my hair . Grandma Cookie must have been eavesdropping from the dining room because she poked her head in and added sarcastically , " Maybe if ' Mrs. unfulfilled ' had n't up and left her husband there would n't be any changes . " " Oh , Ma , for Pete 's sake , give it a rest , " Mama snapped . " I told you it was a mutual decision . " This led to some general bickering , which I tried to ignore as background noise , hearing it without listening . I stared out the window of Grandma 's front room and saw myself in the dusky glass . I did n't hardly recognize the girl in the window . She looked all scrawny and pinched , a little like Grandma Cookie . Other kids had parents who 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned into such a basket case . I guess because if there is one thing I hate , it 's change . Change caused the storm in my dream that night . My worries and fears whipped into a cyclone , whirling around all of this stuff  --  the divorce , our house being sold , Daddy leaving , me feeling sick all the time . The dark funnel movedforward , creeping ever closer to Grandma 's house . I watched from her porch , petrified and filled with dread . When I tried to yell , all that came out was a whisper . Daddy appeared , and came running to save me , but the tornado grabbed him . " Daddy ! " I called . " Come back ! " But just like that , he was gone . Mama came out on the porch with her knitting . She said , " I 've had it with this turmoil ! " All of a sudden , the tornado sucked up her basket , and Mama jumped right in after it . Grandma was in the living room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to hide like anything , but I did n't want to stay with Grandma . I was afraid of the storm , but I could n't stay put . Following Mama , I stepped into the tornado . Up I went , twisting and swirling . I was afraid to go up and I was afraid to go down . My legs felt like rubber and my stomach flapped into my throat . I 'd fling into something and be killed for sure . But I gained control , and found I could fly . I swerved right out of that tornado and decided I 'd fly to the mountains . I was convinced that if I could just get to the woods , everything would slow down . Everything would be safe and lovely , like all the picnics , and summer swims , and autumn walks at my uncle 's mountain farm . I flew to a spot in the woods where the ground seemed to shimmer and play tricks with the light . The plants were soft and close , the air smelled like warm pitch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Here is peace and courage , Willa Jane . " " Who 's there ? " I asked . " Win some , lose some , " the little voice said , giggling . " Win some what ? " Ignoring my question , the child said , " We 're country girls , you and I , no doubt . " The voice faded and was gone with the dream . I woke in the hushed darkness of Grandma Cookie 's spare bedroom . Mama slept in the other single bed , not three feet away . " Mama , " I whispered . She answered immediately , " Waddya need , Wil ? " " I want to go to the country , " I said . " What country is that ? " " The countryside . Like trees and mountains and fresh air . Like at Uncle Andrew 's . Could we do that , Mama ? " " Sounds like a good plan , Sweet Pea . " We had been staying at Grandma Cookie 's while the divorce went through and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'd moved in with Uncle Jackson and Aunt Lena , and my perfect cousins , Rudy and Zack , who looked like models and had gobs of friends . Unlike me . My best friend , Etta Myers , moved away last summer right before all the divorce talk . I wrote Etta long letters , but once she got settled , she wrote back less and less . Then I sort of lost interest in drumming up new friends . I knew I ought to try , but it seemed like so much work . Daddy left after Christmas and it burned me up that he was leaving me to go stay with the perfect cousins . He wanted to go back to college , " to do something meaningful with his life . " I guess that being my daddy was n't meaningful enough . Ever since then , Grandma Cookie made it her job to lecture Mama on the evils of divorce at every opportunity . " Blah-blah , you married too young . Blab-blab , the first divorce in the family . Yackety-yak , what kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it was pointless because Grandma Cookie had no intention of altering her opinion on anything , ever . I listened to it all , and it drove me crazy . My stomach was always churning and I forgot what normal felt like . After missing a million days of school , Mama and my fourth-grade teacher , the principal , and the school psychologist all agreed to a home-school situation . What I needed was " security and consistency . " When we were alone , Mama said , " You do n't have to think about school unless you want to think about school . Your studies can wait until you 're back on your feet . " She said it with conviction . But she looked around nervously , as if truant officers or school security could be skulking in Grandma 's closets . When Mama finally got her money out of the house settlement , she announced that we had overstayed our welcome at Grandma Cookie 's . " It 's time to get out of Dodge , " she said .

" The next day , in the dim light of early morning , we fled the city . With a twinkle in her eye , Mama noisily revved the Honda and squealed away from the curb , speeding down the block without a backward glance . I looked back . Grandma Cookie watched from the porch and waved good-bye , looking bummed out that she had no one left to scold . Continues ...
