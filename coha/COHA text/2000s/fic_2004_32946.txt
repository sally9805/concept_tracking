Chapter One " The Fix " Douglas Langley owned a little sandwich shop at the intersection of Fourteenth and T streets in the District . Beside his shop was a seldom-used alley and above his shop lived a man by the name of Sherman Olney , whom Douglas had seen beaten to near extinction one night by a couple of silky-looking men who seemed to know Sherman and wanted something in particular from him . Douglas had been drawn outside from cleaning up the storeroom by a rhythmic thumping sound , like someone dropping a telephone book onto a table over and over . He stepped out into the November chill and discovered that the sound was actually that of the larger man 's fists finding again and again the belly of Sherman Olney , who was being kept on his feet by the second assailant . Douglas ran back inside and grabbed the pistol he kept in the rolltop desk in his business office . He returned to the scene with the powerful flashlight his son had given him and shone the light into the faces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light , the bigger one saying , " Hey , man , you better get that light out of my face ! " They did however show proper respect for the discharging of the .32 by running away . Sherman Olney crumpled to the ground , moaning and clutching at his middle , saying he did n't have it anymore . " Are you all right ? " Douglas asked , realizing how stupid the question was before it was fully out . But Sherman 's response was equally insipid as he said , " Yes . " " Come , let 's get you inside . " Douglas helped the man to his feet and into the shop . He locked the glass door behind them , then took Sherman over to the counter and helped him onto a stool . " Thanks , " Sherman said . " You want me to call the cops ? " Douglas asked . Sherman Olney shook his head . " They 're long gone by now . " " I 'll make you a sandwich , " Douglas said as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not necessary . " " You 'll like it . I do n't know first aid , but I can make a sandwich . " Douglas made the man a pastrami and Muenster on rye sandwich and poured him a glass of barely cold milk , then took him to sit in one of the three booths in the shop . Douglas sat across the table from him , watched him take a bite of the sandwich . " What did they want ? " Douglas put to him . " To hurt me , " Sherman said , his mouth working on the tough bread . He picked a seed from his teeth and put it on his plate . " They wanted to hurt me . " " My name is Douglas Langley . " " Sherman Olney . " " What are they after , Sherman ? " Douglas asked , but he did n't get an answer . As they sat there , the quiet of the room was disturbed by the loud refrigerator motor kicking on . Douglas felt the vibration of it through the soles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot , " Sherman said . Douglas looked at him , not knowing what he was talking about . " Your fridge . The compressor is bad . " " Oh , yes , " Douglas said . " It 's loud . " " I can fix it . " Douglas just looked at him . " You want me to fix it ? " Douglas did n't know what to say . Certainly he wanted the machine fixed , but what if this man just liked to take things apart ? What if he made it worse ? Douglas imagined the kitchen floor strewn with refrigerator parts . But he said , " Sure . " With that , Sherman got up and walked back into the kitchen , Douglas on his heels . The skinny man removed the plate from the bottom of the big and embarrassingly old machine and looked around . " Do you have any chewing gum ? " Sherman asked . As it turned out , Douglas had , in his pocket , the last stick of a pack of Juicy Fruit , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folded it into his mouth , then lay there on the floor chewing . " What are you doing ? " Douglas asked . Sherman paused him with a finger , then , as if feeling the texture of the gum with his tongue , he took it from his mouth and suck it into the workings of the refrigerator . And just like that the machine ran with a new steady hum , just like it had when it was new . " How 'd you do that ? " Douglas asked . Sherman , now on his feet , shrugged . " Thank you , this is terrific . All you used was chewing gum . Can you fix other things ? " Sherman nodded . " What are you ? Are you a repairman or an electrician ? " Douglas asked . " I can fix things . " " Would you like another sandwich ? " Sherman shook his head again and said . " I should be going . Thanks for the food and all your help . " " Those men might be waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pistol . He could feel the weight of it in his pocket . " Just sit in here awhile . " Douglas felt a great deal of sympathy for the underfed man who had just repaired his refrigerator . " Where do you live ? I could drive you . " " Actually , I do n't have a place to live . " Sherman stared down at the floor . " Come over here . " Douglas led the man to the big metal sink across the kitchen . He turned the ancient lever and the pipes started with a thin whistle and then screeched as the water came out . " Tell me , can you fix that ? " " Do you want me to ? " " Yes . " Douglas turned off the water . " Do you have a wrench ? " Douglas stepped away and into his business office , where he dug his way through a pile of sweaters and newspapers until he found a twelve-inch crescent wrench and a pipe wrench . He took them back to Sherman . " Will these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrench and got down under the sink . Douglas bent low to try and see what the man was doing , but before he could figure anything out , Sherman was getting up . " There you go , " Sherman said . Incredulous , Douglas reached over to the faucet and turned on the water . The water came out smoothly and quietly . He turned it off , then tried it again . " You did it . " " It 's nothing . An easy repair . " " You know , I could really use somebody like you around here , " Douglas said . " Do you need a job ? I ca n't pay much . Just minimum wage , but I can let you stay in the apartment upstairs . Actually , it 's just a room . Are you interested ? " " You do n't even know me , " Sherman said . Douglas stopped . Of course the man was right . He did n't know anything about him . But he had a strong feeling that Sherman Olney was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 're right , " Douglas admitted , " But I 'm a good judge of character . " " I do n't know , " Sherman said . " You said you do n't have a place to go . You can live here and work until you find another place or another job . " Douglas was unsure why he was pleading so with the stranger and , in fact , had a terribly uneasy feeling about the whole business , but , for some reason , he really wanted him to stay . " Okay , " Sherman said . Douglas took the man up the back stairs and showed him the little room . The single bulb hung from a cord in the middle of the ceiling and its dim light revealed the single bed made up with a yellow chenille spread . Douglas had taken many naps there . " This is it , " Douglas said . " It 's perfect . " Sherman stepped fully into the room and looked around . " The bathroom is down the hall . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sure I 'll be comfortable . " " There 's food downstairs . Help yourself . " " Thank you . " Douglas stood in awkward silence for a while wondering what else there was to say . Then he said , " Well , I guess I should go on home to my wife . " " And I should get some sleep . " Douglas nodded and left the shop . ( Continues ... )
