U.S. strategy in the Asia-Pacific ( hereinafter , A-P ) has three main pillars . The first is to minimize the risk of major war and to keep security competition under control . This objective is pursued by maintaining  --  and , in some respects , strengthening  --  U.S. military capabilities in the region . The second pillar , which I emphasize in this article , is the pursuit of open markets consistent with broader U.S. economic strategy in an era of increasing globalization . Toward that end , Washington seeks to maximize trade and investment ties with A-P countries , albeit always on its own terms . The third pillar is to project American values , from the rule of law and the principles of democracy to American-style capitalism and Western concepts of human rights . Although I focus in this article on the policies of the Clinton administration , my underlying premise is that U.S. strategy will exhibit a fundamental continuity under the new Bush administration. ( n1 ) <p> Among observers on both sides of the Pacific  --  including academics , policy analysts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of U.S. hegemony . ( Indeed , these two perspectives reflect the thinking not just of Asian and American observers , but of observers across the world . ) According to the first interpretation , the United States can be seen as a fairly benign ( or perhaps even benevolent ) hegemon . A clearly self-interested Washington seeks  --  and , for the most part , provides  --  both military stability through existing alliance commitments and economic stability through a common ( if unequal ) prosperity achieved by growing economic interdependence . As the largest stakeholder in global affairs , the United States pursues its milieu goals rather unapologetically . At the same time , U.S. hegemony is relatively inclusive and consensual by past great power standards . Indeed , this interpretation would assert that American officials seek to maintain U.S. dominance primarily through the exercise of " soft " power. ( n2 ) In other words , the United States tries to persuade other countries of the benefits that flow from converging with the American model . More broadly , an emphasis on soft power suggests that the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard " power declines , as it almost inevitably will over time . From this perspective , Washington 's support for China 's entry into the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) could be seen as an effort to reassure Beijing that the United States is not trying to contain China 's growing power . American officials hope that , as a result , Chinese leaders will be more likely to recognize areas in which U.S. interests ( e.g. , open markets and the rule of law in world commerce ) complement their own . <p> The second basic interpretation of U.S. hegemony suggests that the common denominator among the three pillars of U.S. strategy for the A-P is a desire to extend , rather than simply ' maintain , American primacy in a region in which no potential counterweight currently exists . From this perspective , the United States is neither balancing against rising Chinese power nor trying to preempt a resurgence of Japanese power . Rather than striving for stability , as many observers presume it is , the United States is seen as actively pursuing greater imbalance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied with the status quo , in which it already enjoys an unrivaled strategic position and economic preponderance unimaginable only a few years ago , Washington seeks to extend its lead whenever and wherever possible . In the economic realm , U.S. " leadership " in pursuing what it describes as mutual benefit might be more appropriately termed " coerced cooperation " In this sense , Washington 's idea of " partnership " is that other countries should conform to American preferences on issues such as trade policies , financial regulation , worker rights , and environmental protection . What Washington really seeks , from this perspective , are vassal states willing to accede to the U.S. vision . An Overview of U.S. Economic Strategy for the Asia-Pacific <p> Economic Liberalism as the Ideological Linchpin of U.S. Foreign Economic Policy <p> Stated simply , the centerpiece of U.S. economic strategy for the A-P is the maintenance and expansion of open markets . As elsewhere in the world , in the A-P Washington 's primary objective is to enlarge the group of countries with market economies committed to the rule of law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " open markets " are to the United States today what " open Seas " were to Great Britain in the nineteenth century . In most respects , the United States is in fact a liberal hegemon ( in the nineteenth century economic sense ) . ( n3 ) From a Smithian ( as opposed to Listian ) perspective , the key to economic growth is allocative efficiency , something best achieved by markets rather than by states . As a matter of ideological principle , therefore , Washington seeks a world economy marked by free trade , currency convertibility , and unfettered capital mobility . <p> Judging from its behavior , the United States has narrowed its economic goals over the last decade . During the Cold War , market liberalization was only one of several economic objectives Washington sought . Indeed , it was arguably subordinate to two other critical objectives : first , the reconstruction of Western Europe and Japan and , second , the development of " third world " countries that were critical for containing the spread of communism . Today , by contrast , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly single-minded purpose . Reinforced initially by the collapse of the Soviet Union , America 's faith in market liberalism has been fed by a host of recent developments , including the extraordinary robustness of the U.S. economy in the late 1990s , the continuing stagnation of the Japanese economy , and the crony capitalism lessons of the Asian Financial Crisis . Undaunted by contradictory lessons about the causes of the financial crisis  --  namely , lessons that call into question the pace of financial globalization internationally and the readiness of many countries to participate in such a process  --  the United States promotes economic openness as strongly as ever . Seeking to capitalize on its current strength , a position only enhanced by fallout from the Asian Financial Crisis , the United States continues to push toward the construction of a rules-based international economic system created in its own image . <p> APEC : U.S. Strategy and Economic Regionalism in the Asia-Pacific <p> The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum ( APEC ) plays a modest , but not insignificant , role in U.S. strategy for the A-P . Washington 's policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of American efforts to advance economic multilateralism . Although the United States continues to rely significantly on unilateral actions and bilateral negotiations to maintain and expand open markets , multilateralism has become an increasingly important means for promoting American interests . Specifically , the United States has sought to establish a reinvigorated regulatory regime  --  of which the WTO is the institutional center  --  to govern international economic competition . From government procurement to investment policy , from intellectual property rights to agricultural policy , and from labor standards to environmental regulations , Washington is trying to promote economic structures and practices consistent with its own system . <p> Especially because the United States was belatedly invited to join APEC  --  over the reservations of some participants  --  Washington has always focused on ensuring that APEC is compatible with the basic WTO regime . Above all , the United States guards against any sign that the forum could degenerate into a discriminatory trade bloc , hoping instead that this regional group can serve as a building block for global economic liberalization . Indeed . Washington has long tried to spearhead APEC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutionalized process working toward concrete goals of freer trade and investment . <p> The United States has also tried to use APEC as bargaining leverage against its non-Asian economic partners , namely the European Union , by generating a " ' fear of exclusion " that the United States would shift emphasis to regional economic groups such as the North American Free Trade Agreement and APEC if satisfactory progress could not be made at a global level . This strategy was first employed in trying to spur a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round in the early 1990s . More recently , and perhaps with less credibility , given APEC 's slow progress , the United States has hoped that the specter of concerted regionalism from Washington ( in both the Americas and the A-P ) will help to jumpstart a new Millennium Round of global trade talks under the WTO . <p> These global considerations notwithstanding , many of Washington 's objectives within APEC are specific to the region . Even in the wake of the Asian Financial Crisis , the A-P arguably remains the most economically dynamic region in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to secure ever wider and more stable access to A-P markets . Furthermore . Washington sees APEC as an important opportunity for institution building in a region characterized by a relative institutional vacuum compared to Europe or the Americas . Looking beyond the forum 's narrow economic objectives , the United States clearly believes that greater economic interdependence  --  and , most importantly , a more institutionalized interdependence  --  will enhance prospects for stability and peace in the A-P . That said , Washington has always insisted privately if not publicly  --  that it be a full participant in any regional arrangement . In this context , recent proposals for monetary cooperation and free trade agreements among the " ASEAN + 3 " countries ( the ten members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) plus Japan , South Korea , and China ) will bear watching , especially for the response of the new Bush administration . <p> " Open Markets " as an Impetus for Political Change <p> As the foregoing suggests , U.S. economic strategy in the A-P serves a wide variety of foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among these is the widespread belief among U.S. policymakers that economic liberalization increases the likelihood of long-term political liberalization , although , as President Clinton was careful to note in arguing to Congress that China should receive permanent normal trade relations , there is absolutely no guarantee of political change . With South Korea and Taiwan for inspiration , American officials believe that the growth of market capitalism can lead to the rule of law and , eventually , to the development of democratic institutions . <p> In this sense , U.S. policy toward China ( as well as other developing countries in the A-P ) reflects the broader goal of enlarging the group of market-oriented , capitalist economies and democratic polities that was a hallmark of Clinton 's foreign policy . By enmeshing A-P countries in Western markets for financial capital , goods , and technology , it is argued , the U.S. preference for political liberalization is also served . As articulated by Clinton and his senior officials , the strategy of opening markets in the A-P therefore represents a fortuitous confluence of U.S. economic and security interests . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benefits that would accrue to the United States from a Free Trade Area of the Americas. ( n4 ) ) In the case of China , Clinton argued that further reform and opening in the economic realm will reduce the power of the Chinese government over its own people . If this leads to significant political change over time , as the theory suggests it will , China 's rising power will arguably be of less concern from a U.S. perspective . A Tale of Two Hegemons <p> The United States as a Benign Hegemon <p> For the most part , Washington acts as if it is a benign ( or perhaps even benevolent ) hegemon . As suggested by former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright 's reference to the United States as " the indispensable nation , " U.S. officials generally see themselves as working with  --  rather than striving to achieve dominance over  --  other countries . Lawrence Summers , Clinton 's Treasury Secretary , even described the United States as the world 's " first nonimperialist superpower . " ( n5 ) Just as the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markets would lead to a more prosperous and peaceful world , so , too , does it regard economic growth as an important means for maintaining international stability at the beginning of the twenty-first century . From this perspective , the current U.S. position is little different from that expressed by Secretary of State George C. Marshall in announcing his June 1947 plan for postwar reconstruction in Europe : " The United States should do whatever it is able to do to assist in the return of normal economic health in the world , without which there can be no political stability and no assured peace . " ( n6 ) <p> Today , as Washington enjoys power unimaginable even a decade ago , the greatest threat to the United States is arguably the weakness of other countries , especially regional powers such as China and Japan . In the A-P , prospects for economic stagnation , social dislocation , political instability , and regional military conflict remain serious concerns , especially in the extended wake of the Asian Financial Crisis . In China 's case , the economic challenges facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banking system are just two of the developmental headaches facing a country trying simultaneously to reform its state-owned enterprises , cope with an increasingly restive society , and deepen its participation in the world economy . For its part , Japan remains mired in a decade-long recession Elsewhere in Northeast and Southeast Asia , painful recovery efforts continue in the aftermath of the financial crisis . Asian-style capitalism , although by no means a dead model , is not the ascendant force it was only a few years ago . <p> For the United States , a major stakeholder in the region , this means that the biggest challenge to American interests  --  as defined by economic well-being at home and stability abroad  --  is the weakness of other countries in the A-E Although the United States benefits by dealing from the strongest hand and clearly wants to maintain this crucial advantage , it gains little from regional powers that are unnecessarily weak . In weakness , these countries can create problems for the United States . U.S. interests are not served if , for example , economic or political weakness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three mare engines of the world economy or to provide reinforcement for U.S. security efforts in the region ( as outlined in the revised military guidelines ) . If political weakness during the financial crisis meant , as it did , that Tokyo was unable to stimulate its economy  --  largely because the government was unable to convince international financial markets that it was serious about banking reform  --  then the United States might actually have preferred a stronger Japan . Along the same lines , if a stagnant Japan means that the United States will have to continue absorbing a disproportionate percentage of world exports  --  especially from East Asia  --  Japanese weakness is not good for America . Here , of course , the same argument would apply to China , South Korea , and Southeast Asia as well : Washington does not want to become a permanent market for distress goods . Chronic trade deficits , at least at current levels , are not sustainable in the long run  --  whatever short-term benefits they have provided during the record-length economic expansion the United States has recently enjoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or weak countries per se , but countries with certain kinds of strengths and weaknesses . For example , Japanese strength in certain areas serves U.S. interests quite well ; Japanese weakness in other areas may serve U.S. interests even better . In short , the United States wants an A-P that is strong and prosperous , albeit strictly on Washington 's terms . This means an economically dynamic , socially stable , politically democratic , law-abiding region in which American supremacy  --  especially military supremacy is unchallenged . If this sounds like Washington wants to have its cake and eat it too , it does . That said , there is a fundamental recognition in Washington that weak powers even potential adversaries , such as China  --  can pose a significant challenge to U.S. interests . In this spirit , Washington supports the continued development of a market economy in China , so long as its evolution conforms to U.S. priorities . The key is a " cooperative " China , by which Washington means a China that acts in accordance with basic U.S. interests . From this perspective , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong China . <p> Given its unrivaled strategic position and preponderant economic power , the United States feels little insecurity at present . In John Mueller 's words , Washington is an " unthreatened wealth-seeker. " ( n7 ) Although American officials seem to believe that the United States will benefit from greater openness in the world economy at least as much as other countries  --  advanced industrial and developing ones alike  --  any residual uncertainty about who will benefit the most is mitigated by several factors . First , American primacy is Currently so great that there would be little danger to U.S. interests even if other countries were to enjoy faster economic growth for , say , the next decade . At the very least , Washington enjoys the luxury of observing events for a while . If necessary , U.S. strategy could be changed long before any truly adverse shift in relative power could occur . It is important to note that the United States has not yet concluded that China or any other country aims to supplant it as the dominant power in the A-P . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen as inevitable . In sum , Washington currently sees no country as having either the capability or the fixed intention to challenge its primacy . Second , American reservations about a loss in relative power might be partially offset as long as the loss is accompanied by a continued institutionalization of the international economic system consistent with American values . ( That would , for instance , reduce the possibility that another country could successfully employ a mercantilist strategy . ) Although the United States might prove unwilling to pursue only absolute gains in the long run , the nature of the current world economy certainly makes it more willing to find out who  --  itself or other countries  --  will actually benefit the most from greater openness . In much the same way , other expected benefits from economic openness ( e.g. , increased political liberalization and reduced security competition ) also mitigate concerns that U.S. power might be diminished in relative terms . <p> Imperial America <p> Most American officials undoubtedly do believe that an open international economic system is , in the words of Charlene Barshefsky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutual benefit . " As described earlier , one interpretation of U.S. hegemony is that it is fairly benign , with Washington perhaps even content to pursue absolute gains for a while , if necessary for regional stability . According to the second interpretation of U.S. hegemony , however , the basic aim of American strategy is to increase its relative power , especially by extending its strategic dominance in military capability but also through an aggressive U.S.-led " globalization " of the world economy . Examples in the security realm include Washington 's pursuit of national missile defense and an IT-driven revolution in military affairs. ( n8 ) Already the preponderant power , Washington actively seeks to further its lead . In the A-P , for example , what might appear to be balancing against rising Chinese power ( e.g. , the proposed development of theater missile defense and a strengthening of U.S.-Japanese military cooperation ) is in fact the pursuit of greater imbalance . The United States is not worried about peer competitors , either in the A-P or globally , because there are no such candidates at present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its primacy in almost imperial fashion . In this sense , the United States not a status quo power seeking stability ( i.e. , maintenance of the current imbalance ) but an unsatiated power trying to find the right mix of stability and greater imbalance . <p> Evidence of a similar approach can be found in U.S. economic strategy . Washington has redoubled its efforts in recent years to use the international economic system  --  especially the WTO and the International Monetary Fund ( IMF )  --  to set rules of the game that favor the most technologically advanced and competitive countries . Although this policy may benefit other Group of Seven countries as well , especially relative to the developing world , the United States can be seen as pushing especially hard for greater international openness in specific economic activities where its lead is currently unchallenged . Good examples here would include the WTO 's Information Technology Agreement . Basic Telecommunications Agreement , and Financial Services Agreement . In its final year in office , the Clinton administration worked feverishly to shape international rules for electronic commerce , another area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from open markets . <p> In general , U.S. strategy in the A-P ( and elsewhere ) has been to force open economies so that U.S. companies  --  from Citibank to America Online  --  can extend their competitive edge . Although Washington 's priorities undoubtedly have an instrumentalist aspect , one closely related to the influence of big business on domestic politics . U.S. support for open markets should not be dismissed merely as the promotion of private interests . There is every reason to believe that Washington 's efforts to " rig the system " reflect a strategic effort to extend American economic dominance in an era of increasing globalization . Just as the United States is trying to extend its strategic dominance in military capability by pursuing national missile defense and an IT-driven revolution in military affairs , it is also aggressively seeking the adoption of economic policies in the international system that will allow the United States to exploit new frontiers of economic activity in which it clearly is best positioned to succeed . <p> In U.S. strategy , " globalization " means the spread of American norms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction of intergovernmental and transnational regimes based on American conceptions ' of capitalism and the rule of law . Recent examples include Washington 's use of the IMF to promote changes in the economic structures and practices of Asian countries during the Asian Financial Crisis and Clinton 's efforts to include labor and environmental standards on the WTO agenda for a new Millennium Round of global trade negotiations . In this sense , the term " benevolent hegemon " is truly an oxymoron : no one will benefit more from convergence around American standards and practices than the United States itself . Although many American officials may genuinely perceive a complementary relationship between U.S. interests and global interests , it is hard to deny that Washington is consciously trying to harness globalization narrowly to its own advantage . Here , U.S. economic strategy vis vis globalization is neither passive nor defensive ; it is actively seeking to reshape the international economic system ever more in the American image . Life under U.S. Hegemony <p> According to the first interpretation of U.S. hegemony , Washington 's concerns about relative power are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Asian Financial Crisis , American primacy is unchallenged . So great is the gap , in fact , that U.S. interests would not be seriously jeopardized even if other economies were to grow faster for the immediate future . To be sure , Washington is still concerned with positional advantage in the international system and clearly believes it will benefit at least as much as other countries from greater openness in the world economy , but the United States enjoys the luxury of being able to monitor developments safely from its privileged economic and military position . In fact , the greatest threat to U.S. interests at present might actually stem from the weaknesses  --  especially economic weakness but also political instability and military insecurity  --  of other countries in the A-P region . The second interpretation of U.S. hegemony , by contrast , suggests that Washington has embraced globalization in the economic realm in much the same spirit as it has embraced national missile defense and an IT-driven revolution in the military realm . Sensing the prospect for further advantage , the United States aggressively seeks to exploit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , other countries must find consolation in the prospect that economic success is possible within an American-dominated system . Especially if U.S. hegemony is viewed as being relatively benign , mutual economic benefit represents an important opportunity . Although the more imperial view of U.S. hegemony would suggest that any economic growth enjoyed by other countries is likely to be restricted to absolute rather than relative gains , the prospect for economic development  --  albeit perhaps a dependent form of development  --  should not be dismissed . <p> Another source of hope for other countries is the prospect that America 's lead will not last as long as Washington currently anticipates . By seeking to extend the dominance it enjoys today , rather than maintaining the status quo , the United States is likely over time to find itself the object of concerted balancing efforts by other countries . In this sense , U.S. strategy could ultimately backfire . Indeed , balancing is just one of several dangers to an imperial America . Given the recognized tendency of markets to concentrate wealth in the short run but to diffuse wealth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to result in a process of uneven national economic development , one that Robert Gilpin and others have argued typically reduces the relative power of hegemons over time. ( n9 ) <p> Failing either successful balancing or uneven development , there is also the prospect that the United States will become increasingly constrained by the very same institutions ( e.g. , WTO ) it helped to create . Although dominant powers always exert disproportionate influence over international governance , it is possible that the rules created by Washington may grow in weight to the point where even the United States may find its range of action constrained by a new institutional context . Any of this a long time off , however . Although it would be intellectually reckless to speculate about how long U.S. dominance will last , the end of the twentieth century was clearly not the end of the American Century . <p>
