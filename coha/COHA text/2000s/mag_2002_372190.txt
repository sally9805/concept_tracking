If you want to know why New York City can survive anything you throw at it , one good place to start is the Louis Faurer retrospective at the Houston Museum of Fine Arts . In the 1940s and ' 50s , when Faurer roamed the streets with his 35-mm camera , New York was already a cyclotron for every human impulse . The saintly and the unsanitary spun around at high speed . In his pictures the city was a place of immigrant bustlers . Raw bloodlines howl from their faces . The streets were full of plump , sexy cars , carnal Fords and pontoon-fendered Buicks . By some reports Faurer could be a difficult , saturnine man . But he had a gift for seizing thunderbolts from New York 's crackling air . He made just a handful of great pictures , but in them you find the city we still know  --  so intricate in mood , so darkly complicated that it 's plainly vulnerable . Invincible too . <P> Faurer was 84 when he died last March  --  too soon to see this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the museum 's curator of photography . It remains in Houston through April 14 , then moves to Andover , Mass. , San Diego , Chicago and Philadelphia  --  though , oddly , not to New York City . In the exhibition catalog Louis Faurer ( Merrell ; 208 pages ; $65 ) , Tucker notes that Faurer is one of the " missing links " between the Depression-era documentary photography of Walker Evans and the darker moods and more ragged manner of Robert Frank 's great 1958 book The Americans . That 's exactly right . Faurer , who grew up in Philadelphia , never attended college or art school . He simply started taking pictures during the Depression , the era of socially conscious " concerned photography . " But by the time he moved to New York in 1946 , he was discovering a more personal style . If this was " concerned photography , " it was concerned not with social conditions but psychic ones  --  boredom , isolation , acidity , glee , the feral thrusts of the libido and a weirdly sinister expectancy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it did to the tabloid-news photographer Weegee , the king of every New York tar pit . <P> As he looked for ways to make his pictures say more , Faurer became increasingly fascinated with multiple-exposure shots like Accident , New York , N.Y. , one of the great photographs of the postwar years . ( Faurer 's personal archives were messy ; we are sure only that the picture was taken sometime between 1949 and 1952 . ) The nominal subject is a boy turning away from the site of a car accident . At the center of the image is a bit of morbid official graffiti  --  a chalk outline of the victim 's body that is unmistakably phallic , so that love and death are strangely and also childishly intertwined . The boy hugs himself in a gesture that may or may not be dread . His expression is soft and distracted , as though he is thinking over the hard realities of life . But by double exposing the film in his camera Faurer also added to the accident scene a wedding party on the steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience , street realism and stick-figure abstraction  --  all in one magnificently congested frame .
