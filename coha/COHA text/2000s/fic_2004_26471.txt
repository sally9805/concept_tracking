Wonder When You 'll Miss Me A Novel Chapter One At school I was careful not to look like I watched everything , but I did . The fat girl fell into step beside me . She had a handful of gumdrops and sugar on her chin . " There are all kinds of anger , " she said . " Some kinds are just more useful than others . " A locker slammed behind us . I tried not to speak too loudly , because no one except me saw her . " I 'm not angry , " I whispered . " Saying you 're not angry is one kind , " she said . " Not very useful at all , though . " I ignored her and brushed hair out of my eyes . There were days when she was a comfort and days when she was a nightmare . I had yet to determine what kind of day this would be . We made our way outside . The fat girl had stringy brown hair and wore a blue blouse that was spotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the autumn day was blissful and warm , but I was freezing . We pressed ourselves against the courtyard wall to watch the crowd file by . When I turned my head she followed my gaze and patted my shoulder . " Do n't get your hopes up , Faith , " she said . " Sweetie , I 'm telling you , that is never going to work out . " She was talking about Tony Giobambera , who had dark curly hair all over his body and smiled with his mouth but not with his eyes ; who walked slowly , like a man with a secret . I said , " You never know . " She said , " Actually , I do know . " Then she sucked off a big piece of chocolate . Tony Giobambera settled on his rock and lit a cigarette . I followed the fat girl to a place where we could watch him . He smoked like the cigarette was an extension of his ropey arm and rough hand . When he leaned back and blew a stream into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the black curl that fell over one eye . Then Tony Giobambera smiled in our direction and I wanted to disappear . " Nothing like a little attention to send you over the edge , " the fat girl said . " What would you do ? " I said . " I mean I do n't think you 'd do anything different . " " I 'd think about getting even , " she said . " I 'd think about making something happen . " Instead I found a better place on the grass where I could see him but pretend to stare off into space , thinking about more important things than how much I would give up just to have Tony Giobambera run his finger along my cheek and my throat again . - - - It was after what I did , the long summer after I 'd shed myself completely and was prepared to come back to school like a whole new person , only inside it was still me . It was at an end-of-the-summer party a week before school started . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humid and heavy . I sang softly to myself , thinking of how different I looked , of what it would be like to walk into a party in normal-person clothes bought from a normal store . I smoothed the front of my new sleeveless green blouse . I could hear the party behind the big white door . I took a deep breath and rang the bell , but nothing happened . I leaned over a little and through the windows I saw people draped over couches and moving in the dark . I rang the bell again , then tried the door . It was open . Inside , Led Zeppelin blasted from the stereo . A guy and a girl curled up together in the corner of the foyer . In the living room , people stood in clumps along the wall or splayed themselves over couches and chairs . The house rang with noise . I walked down a hallway . I put my hands in my pockets , then took them out again . In the kitchen I found a beer but did n't open it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basement . A few muscled guys and a pale , fragile-looking girl sat around the kitchen table flipping quarters into a glass . They slurred their words , laughing loudly and hitting each other in the back of the head when a quarter missed the cup . Drink , drink , drink ! they chanted . The girl smoked a cigarette with a glazed smile . One guy glanced up at me , but looked away quickly . I blushed anyway . I wandered downstairs to the basement , where I recognized a few people from last year 's English class . They sat in a circle around a reedy guy with long blond hair and a red bong , hanging on every word he had to say . He told a complicated story , something involving a car and the police , but I could n't follow it . Every so often one of the girls shook her head . " Fuck , " she said , and ran her tongue over her braces . " Holy fuck . " I went back upstairs and walked from room to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but no one seemed to . Disappointment pushed me outside . I tripped my way down wooden stairs , away from the bright lights of the house toward the small latticed huddle of a gazebo . Inside there was a bench and I sat , slapping away mosquitoes , with a tightness in my chest that made me want to scream . How could everything change so much and stay exactly the same ? I 'd lost forty-eight pounds and my skin had mostly cleared up . I 'd missed a whole semester of school and disappeared for seven months . It seemed like no one had even noticed I was gone . I pulled my knees to my chest and picked at the vines that climbed the trellis overhead , ripping off leaves and stripping them down to their veins . I was wondering how I would possibly survive the whole next year , when Andrea Dutton came stumbling out of the trees . Wonder When You 'll Miss Me
