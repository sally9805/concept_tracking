Chapter One : Burgoyne &; Selar Selar stared at the desert in the middle of Burgoyne 's living room , then looked in astonishment at the Hermat . She held their child close to her , looked as if she wanted to say something , said nothing , and instead looked back at the desert . " Too much ? " inquired Burgoyne solicitously . Cautiously Selar walked the perimeter of the red desert sands . She felt heat radiating from the sands . A heat lamp above gave a fair approximation of a desert sun . " This , " she said slowly , " is insane . " Burgoyne looked rather surprised . " I do n't know why you would say that . " " Why I would say that ? " The Vulcan doctor had walked around the desert and wound up back next to Burgoyne . The infant , Xyon , cooed blissfully . " Burgoyne ... there is a desert ... in the living room . Why is there a desert in the living room ? " " Not enough space in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Selar said with forced patience . " Yes , I suspected it was n't , " Burgoyne admitted . " You do n't like it ? " " That is also not the point . It has nothing to do with like or dislike . The question is why you felt a need to construct a replica of a desert in a room normally reserved for matters of socialization . " " For you . " " I do not recall asking you to construct such a thing . " " Yes , I know you did n't ask . I was doing it to try to make you feel at home . " Selar let out a long , patient , and  --  ultimately  --  emotionless sigh . " Burgoyne , " she said finally , " we need to talk . " " All right , " Burgoyne said reasonably . S/he went to a chest of drawers and pulled out a couple of large blankets . This action puzzled Selar somewhat , but things were quicklymade clear when Burgoyne spread the blankets out on the sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other one , indicating that Selar should take a seat next to hir . Selar was sorely tempted to remain standing , but decided that matters would be simpler if she just humored the Hermat for a while . So she sat on the blanket that was a few inches away from Burgoyne . Burgoyne looked quite ready to listen to anything that Selar was prepared to say . " Go ahead , " s/he prompted . " Burgoyne , " she said slowly , " first , I should acknowledge the efforts to which you have gone . Obviously , you are aware that my native Vulcan is somewhat arid and desert-like in many places . Unlike the other Starfleet personnel who are taking advantage of the cooling-off period , you have chosen not to reside in San Francisco , in proximity to the Academy . Instead , you have obtained this lovely residence here in Nevada , on a stretch of territory that is not unlike Vulcan . " " I wanted to make you comfortable . " " I know . Your attention to my comfort and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you think I might have , has been very ... " She cast about in her mind for the right word . " Flattering , " she finally settled on . " And I have been willing to accommodate your endeavors because ... frankly , I had not developed a workable strategy to the contrary . However  --  " " However what ? " s/he prompted . " You can tell me anything , Selar . You know that . " " No . I do not know that , " Selar replied . " There are many things that I can not tell you because it is a waste of time . There are things that you do not wish to hear , and , therefore , you tend not to hear them . " " What sort of things ? I 'm listening now . " " Burgoyne ... " She drew a deep breath . " I do not love you . " " Yes , you do , " Burgoyne said cheerily . Selar let the breath out , shaking her head . " You see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that you 're afraid  --  " " No . I am not afraid . " She rose and walked around the interior desert , shaking her head in a combination of frustration and amusement . " I am Vulcan . I am logical . I am able to put the reasonable aspects of a relationship ahead of any foolish emotional entanglements . And , logically , it is utterly unreasonable to think that any long-term relationship between us could work . " " Excuse me , Selar , " Burgoyne said , indicating the child who was happily burbling on the blanket , " but we already have a long term commitment , and that 's him . He 's as much my child as he is yours . " Selar was silent . " I said , ' He 's as much  --  ' " " I heard you , Burgoyne , " she said softly . " My hearing is quite acute , as I am sure you are aware . " Burgoyne leaned back against the nearest wall , watching Selar with open confusion . " Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hir tone that seemed vaguely warning . " The child has Vulcan ears , and the face is of a generally Vulcan cast . As for his reproductive system ... " " He is singularly male . Yes , I know . " She raised an eyebrow . " You say that with a hint of regret . " Burgoyne 's lips thinned . " You keep talking about how you know nothing about emotions , Selar . About how above them you are . So , if it 's all the same to you , do n't start attributing emotions to how I say things , considering you claim to be unfamiliar with them . " " Very well , " she said . " The point is ... your genetic contribution seems minimal to nonexistent . " " I 'm still his father . " " And for that , you will always have my gratitude . But  --  " " Gratitude , " Burgoyne interrupted her , snorting disdainfully . " You know , Selar , I 'm starting to wonder if you know the meaning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciative awareness or  --  " " That 's not what I mean and you know it ! " It seemed as if Burgoyne 's meticulously crafted control was starting to erode . Selar could n't help but think that if Burgoyne was in some sort of " competition " to see who could keep themselves reserved longer , s/he did n't have a prayer . S/he was pacing furiously . Still sitting on the floor , Xyon 's attention was now caught by hir , and he watched hir as s/he moved back and forth . " How much more do I have to be there for you ? I was there for you when you were in the grip of pon farr . I was there for you , for emotional support , during your pregnancy . I saved your life  --  " " Burgoyne , I know that  --  " " Saved your life ! " s/he shouted over her . " I was so linked into your mind that I fought monsters and kept you alive so that you could give birth to our son in a hostile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monster , not plural . " " Who cares ? " " I care . We might as well be precise . " Burgoyne covered hir face with hir hands . " Selar ... does it matter whether it was one monster , two , or twenty ? The point is , you owe me your life , and the life of Xyon . " " I am very well aware of that , " Selar said reasonably . " But what did you expect of me , Burgoyne ? Did you believe that I would come to love you because of those things ? " " I believed that , at the very least , you would n't reject me out of hand . " " It is not out of hand . It is ... " " What ? What is it ? " Selar looked away . " Burgoyne ... you want me to give something of which I am not capable . " " I do n't believe that , " Burgoyne said firmly . " I do n't believe that you 're incapable of love . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that 's as far as I 'll take it . " S/he shook hir head in exasperation . " You know what ? I 'm starting to wonder why I even bother . " " As am I , " Selar said reasonably . " What did you think was going to happen here , Burgoyne ? " She steadied herself . " It is my fault . You see , Burgoyne ... I was operating out of gratitude . Believe it or not , " she added dryly . " Let 's just say I 'm skeptical , " Burgoyne said , but s/he sounded uncertain . " I agreed to come out here , to reside with you in this domicile , because I believed that you were ... entitled in some way . That , after everything you had been through in connection with me and this child  --  " " Xyon . " " Yes . Xyon . " She frowned . " I know his name . " " That may be , but you never say it . You just say , ' this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name . It 's as if you 're trying to distance yourself even now . " " I am trying to do nothing of the kind . The point is , Burgoyne , that you had gone to a great deal of effort to create a safe and nurturing environment for both my child  --  " " Our child , " Burgoyne immediately corrected . " Our child ... and me , " Selar continued . " And I have resided here for eleven days , thirteen hours and fifty-seven minutes . I have given you time to get to know your child  --  " " Our child . " This time Selar took longer to make the correction . An observer might have concluded that the unflappable Vulcan was becoming just the least bit annoyed . " Our child , " she said slowly . " But I believe that I have falsely given you the impression that this could possibly attain some sort of long-term status , when such is not the case . " " Would you like to know , " Burgoyne said , " what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspect you will tell me whether I desire to know or not . " " Absolutely true . " Burgoyne took a steadying breath . " I thought I could walk away , Selar . I thought I could accommodate your biological need , provide you with a child , and then turn away and leave him or her in your hands . And I suppose I also thought that we would have time to sort things out . After all , we were going to be continuing to serve on the same ship . Neither of us was going anywhere . So you could say that a false sense of security set in . Well , we 're not on a ship together , and if we 're going to raise this child as a couple  --  " " Burgoyne . " Even Selar 's endless patience was waning " We are not a couple . We are not going to raise this child together . I am his mother . " " And I am his father . " " But according to Vulcan law , my interests in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Burgoyne . S/he had stopped pacing , and was now facing Selar in a rather challenging pose . " So now we get down to it . " " Get down to what ? " " You feel that you 're more important to Xyon 's future than I am . You 're intending to cut me out of all interest in his development and growth . " " For you to be ' cut out , ' " Selar said , with what she felt to be fairly reasonable consideration , " you would have had to be ' cut in ' in the first place . You have not been . It has always been my intention to be this child 's primary parent . " " Why ? " " Why ? " Selar blinked at the question . " Yes . Why ? " S/he gestured toward Xyon , who  --  it seemed to Selar  --  was actually beginning to look a little concerned , as if aware that his parents were having a disagreement . " You keep telling me how incapable you are of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be if you ca n't even love your child ? " " A Vulcan mother . One who will teach Xyon about his heritage and raise him in the Vulcan way , as per Vulcan law . " " Well , you know what ? " Burgoyne said defiantly . " We Hermats have a few laws of our own . That child right there is as much Hermat as he is Vulcan , no matter what the biological tests might say right now . " " I think , " she told him , " that if you do some serious study into the matter , instead of confining your awareness on the topic to emotional outbursts , you will find that not to be the case . Vulcan genes tend to dominate . This is true in Vulcan/Human pairings , and is true as well in this union . Burgoyne , I think it would be best if you were reasonable . " " I am being reasonable . Xyon 's entitled to know of his Hermat heritage . " " But he needs to be raised as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What are you saying ? " " I am saying that it is my intention to return with Xyon to Vulcan , to reside there , and to raise him as a Vulcan . He will be taught the orderly discipline of logic , he will be  --  " " He will be my son , with no opportunity to truly grasp his heritage . " " His heritage ? " She shook her head and actually looked amused , or as close to that as she came . " Burgoyne , this is foolishness . The fact that he is your son flatly contradicts that he could even have a heritage . Hermats do not have sons , or daughters . All of you are mixed genders . " " We prefer the term ' blend . ' " " Blend . If that is your phrase of choice , fine . The point is , your calling him your son precludes the very claim to Hermat upbringing that you bandy about . If he has one heritage , then he is not Hermat . " " You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you referring ? " Burgoyne looked left and right , as if s/he were about to impart some great , secret knowledge . In a lowered voice , s/he said , " There is a prophecy ... a Hermat prophecy , going back centuries . A prophecy that says there will come a child ... a child who is Hermat , but not of Hermat ... a child with pointed ears and alien head , but of Hermat heart . One who will unite the fractious Hermat population and guide us forward into a golden age . And that prophesied child ... could very well be our son . " Selar was stunned . She looked from the baby back to Burgoyne . " Is any of that true ? " she inquired . Burgoyne opened hir mouth to continue the boasts , then sighed and sagged , like a deflated balloon . " No . It 's all lies , " s/he admitted . " But it sounded good , did n't it ? " Selar 's lips twitched ever so slightly . " Sometimes , Burgoyne , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then think of this , " Burgoyne told her . " You said these past eleven days were so that I could get to know the child . Eleven days ? Eleven days , Selar ? The truth is that people spend a lifetime getting to know their children , and even at the end of that , they can still be as much of a mystery as they were at the beginning . The sad thing is that you do n't understand that . The fortunate thing is that I do . The child needs both of us , Selar . Both of us . It is only ... logical . " " But I do not love you , Burgoyne , " she said firmly . " I feel as close to you as ... " " You 'll allow yourself to be ? " She frowned slightly at that . " This is accomplishing nothing , Burgoyne . " Burgoyne seemed about to argue further , but then s/he sighed , looking fatigued . " You know ... you 're probably right . I admit that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps we 've hit a stalemate simply because we 're going back and forth over the same ground . That perhaps tomorrow might bring fresher views and new insights . " " I do not know that I agree , " said Selar , " but I concur that it is possible . You are suggesting that we ' sleep on it , ' as they say . " " As they say , " agreed Burgoyne readily . " Very well , Burgoyne . I owe you much , I admit that . So I certainly owe you a night 's consideration . Let us consider matters tomorrow . " Burgoyne bobbed hir head ... and then reached toward Selar with hir right hand , the first two fingers extended . Selar was a bit surprised , but hid it with practiced ease . She hesitated a moment , and then extended the first two fingers of her own right hand . Their fingers touched , caressed each other gently in the Vulcan custom that served as an open display of affection . " There , " smiled Burgoyne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so horrible now , was it ? The world did n't come to an end . Maybe there is hope for us , Selar . What do you think ? " " There are always ... possibilities , " Selar said diplomatically . Dreams tumbled about in Burgoyne 's head , images that s/he could not determine , nor did s/he wish to . They were too upsetting in nature , and were best left for another time . S/he awoke and sat up in hir bed , then glanced at the chronometer . But that simply verified what s/he knew instinctively : it was the middle of the night . S/he had no idea why ... but suddenly s/he wanted Selar . There was no rhyme , no " logic " to it . It was n't as if Selar would be interested . And even if she was , it was insane to think that an act of passion in the middle of the night could settle the differences between them . " Then again , at least it would be a start , " Burgoyne murmured to hirself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hir bedroom and down the hall to where Selar slept . The door , s/he was pleased to see , was unlocked . That might be considered a very good sign . S/he stepped quietly into the room , allowing hir catlike eyes to adjust to the dimness , and padded over to the bed . S/he knelt down upon it ... and , instantly , the absence of warmth indicated to hir that the bed was empty . This did not immediately concern hir . S/he reasoned that the baby must have stirred , cried for his mother . Hermat parents tended to keep their children in the room with them during the early days . Selar had not felt it necessary : with those impressive ears of hers , there was no way Selar would not hear him should he stir in the night . So Selar was undoubtedly in the adjoining room , tending to little Xyon 's needs . That was what Burgoyne kept telling hirself , right up to the point where s/he entered the baby 's room and found that empty as well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a walk . These and other explanations tumbled about in Burgoyne 's head as s/he went from one room to the next , and to the next , still fighting down a combination of anger and panic . But as s/he moved through the house , s/he went faster and faster until  --  by the time s/he was inspecting the exterior in the last , flagging hope that Selar and Xyon would be out there  --  s/he was practically sprinting . S/he bolted to the outside . The desert air was surprisingly sharp in hir lungs as s/he bounded around the perimeter of the house . By now s/he was moving on all fours , balancing the spring in hir powerful legs with hir knuckles . S/he moved away from the house , hir nostrils flaring , trying to catch a scent in the air . And s/he picked one up . No ... there were three . There was Selar , and Xyon ... and there was the faint , burning whiff of ozone that told hir a small ship had come . Come and gone . Gone ... with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blood-red full moon that hung in the sky , and then s/he threw back hir head and let out a scream that sent small animals scurrying . A scream that carried across the desolation of the peaceful night desert , and seemed to go on until morning .
