In the pilot of Joey , America 's favorite Friend  --  well , America 's favorite Friend who could be persuaded to do a spin-off  --  moves to L.A. and lands a TV role as a male nurse , but turns it down . Days later the new show is a hit , and the actor who took the role instead has become a megastar . <P> The makers of Joey know TV series do n't get on the air until months after taping . But why should Joey be any more realistic about life in Hollywood than Friends was about Manhattan real estate ? This is one of many ways that Joey signals its determination to deliver what NBC desperately wants : familiar , Friends-style humor to kick off Thursdays at 8 p.m . E.T . exactly as we remember it  --  nothing less and nothing more . <P> Successful sitcom spin-offs  --  Frasier , Laverne &; Shirley  --  give their lead characters new challenges and foils and find a fresh voice that suits them . In this show , Joey Tribbiani , Matt LeBlanc 's sweet-hearted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his equally Noo Yawky sister Gina ( The Sopranos ' Drea de Matteo ) . We also meet his nephew Michael ( Paulo Costanzo ) , a rocket scientist ; his sharky agent , Bobbie ( one-woman brass band Jennifer Coolidge ) ; and his bland , pretty , married neighbor Alex ( Andrea Anders ) . But none of these types are fresh or memorable . There 's no Niles . Not even a Squiggy . <P> Deftly written , Joey sets up running gags and delayed payoffs with the precision of the special forces laying mines , much as Friends did . No , exactly as Friends did , and that 's a problem . It reminds us that five-sixths of the Dream Team is missing . And where Joey does change , it 's abruptly and implausibly . When he was funny on Friends , it was usually unintentionally . He still is , but when the writers need someone to deliver a Chandler-style zinger , they just lend Joey 50 IQ points for five seconds . When Gina , visiting Joey 's TV taping , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he cracks , " That 's because you 've got big fake boobs and you 're crazy . " <P> That 's a funny line  --  but not for our Joey . And Joey 's pilot is funny , but it is also sad , like a high school Mr. Popularity continuing to go to homecoming after he has graduated . " Change can be good , " Joey says about his relocation . True , and his show needs more of it if it wants to become comfort food and not just leftovers .
