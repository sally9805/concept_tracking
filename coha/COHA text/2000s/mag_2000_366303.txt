When magician DAVID COPPERFIELD found himself in a bind he could n't escape , he got some real masters-of-the-universe help from former CIA and KGB insiders . After a Dec. 12 performance in Moscow , Copperfield had his seven trucks and all his equipment seized by the Russian promoters , who claimed he owed them money . The State Department was unable to help , and after three weeks without his trucks , a desperate Copperfield turned to IGI , a security agency populated with former CIA and FBI insiders . The ex-spooks reached out to the KGB vets they had spied on in the past . " In Russia , they are the people that know the terrain the best , " says IGI vice president Jack Devine . " They know how to negotiate . " Evidently . According to Devine , the " negotiators " came up with an agreement " which was comfortable for all parties . " The ordeal cost Copperfield more than $500,000 , but on Jan. 15 his magic convoy finally disappeared from Russia , crossing the border into friendlier Finland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
