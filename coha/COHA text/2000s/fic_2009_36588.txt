THE PHOTOGRAPHER <p> Especially when he was alone Alec Malone had the habit of slipping into reverie , a semiconscious state not to be confused with dreams . Dreams were commonplace while his reveries presented a kind of abstract grandeur , expressionist canvases in close focus , untitled . That was how he thought of them , and not only because of the score in the background , German music , voices , trumpets , metronomic bass drums , and now and again the suggestion of a tango or a march . The reveries had been with him since childhood and he treated them like old friends paying a visit . The friends aged as he did , becoming increasingly abstract now that he had begun to lose sight in his right eye , a hole in the macula that began as a pinprick but was now the size of an o . That eye saw only the periphery of things with any clarity . The condition was annoying , not disabling , since sight was a function not of one eye but of two and Alec 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an adventure . He did not permit himself to drive in fog because objects had a way of vanishing altogether . And there was some amusement - when he closed his left eye and looked at a human face with his right , that face appeared as an expressionist 's death's-head , an image very like Munch 's The Scream . <p> Alec had the usual habits of one who lived alone : a fixed diet , a weekly visit to the bookstore , a scrupulously balanced checkbook , and a devotion to major league baseball and the PGA Tour . He worked when he felt like it . He described himself to himself as leading a chamber-music sort of life except for the Wagnerian reveries . They were neutral fantasies , meaning they had nothing to do with the life he wished he had led - Alec was quite content with the one he had - or might lead in the future . He did not count himself a prophet . He returned often to his childhood but rarely lingered there . His childhood was so long ago that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have happened to someone else and were incomplete in any case , washed-out colors side by side with ink-black holes , a half-remembered country governed by a grim-faced man with a long nose , a figure from antiquity , perhaps a bildnis from Dnrer 's sketchbook . Alec considered the long-nosed man a family heirloom , grandmother 's silver or the pendulum clock on the mantel , the one whose ticks and tocks sounded like pistol reports . He lost his footing in those early years in which the domestic life of his own family was usurped by the civic life of the nation . That was the life that counted . The Malone dinner table , his father presiding , was a combination quiz show and news conference . <p> Quick now , Alec . How many congressional districts in Iowa ? Which nations were signatories to the Locarno Pact ? Who wrote " Fear of serious injury can not alone justify suppression of free speech and assembly . Men feared witches and burned women . It is the function of speech to free men from the bondage of irrational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel House ? <p> Where is Yalta ? <p> Question : What 's the difference between ignorance and indifference ? <p> Answer : I do n't know and I do n't care . <p> Hush , Alec . Do n't disturb your father when he 's talking to Mr. Roosevelt . Do n't you know there 's a war on ? <p> + la recherche du temps Roosevelt . The president inhabited the house in Chevy Chase like a member of the family or a living god , present everywhere and visible nowhere . Alec 's father called him the Boss . The Boss wants this , the Boss wants that . The Boss sounded a little tired today but he 's leaving for Warm Springs tomorrow . In his reveries Alec conjured the president in his White House office , talking into the telephone in his marbled Hudson River voice , commanding an entire nation - its armies , its factories and farms , all its citizens great and small . Yet Alec had no sense of him as a man - not then , not later - and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was great . He was the greatest man his father had ever met , and he had met many , many of the highest men in the land , shaken their hands , spoken tOte-a-tOte , worked with them , worked against them . The Boss was different . The Boss lived on a different level , deriving his strength and his courage from - and here his father faltered , uncomfortable always in the realm of the mystical . Finally he said , His legs are useless , you know . He can hardly walk . But he likes a martini at the end of the day just like the rest of us , and there the comparison ends . Alec , I 'd say he 's Shakespearean . That 's the best I can do . <p> Alec nodded , wondering all the while which of Shakespeare 's kings his father had in mind - Macbeth , Richard III , Coriolanus ? Henry V , no doubt , though that comparison did not seem apt . Shakespeare 's kings suffered the consequences of their will to power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not that they did not have ample assistance from others - wives , false friends , rivals , the Fates . When the president died Alec 's father was inconsolable . Washington was suddenly a darker , lesser place . Then he was summoned by Harry Truman - they had never gotten along - who extended his hand and asked for help , not an easy thing for him to do . Mr. Truman was a prideful man , often vindictive . Of course Senator Malone agreed to do whatever Mr. Truman wanted done . There was a war on . Each man did his part willingly . But it was n't the same . <p> For years Franklin D. Roosevelt figured in Alec 's reveries but eventually faded as Alec drifted upward , forward to his young manhood and early middle age and beyond , what he considered his meridian years - when he was out of his father 's house , out of his orbit , out from under , married to Lucia Duran and working in what his father dismissively called " snapshots " but which every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to follow him into politics , commencing a dynasty ; state attorney general , his father thought , then governor , and after that anything was possible . The Boss had been a governor . <p> No , Alec told his father . <p> But - why ever not ? <p> I do n't believe in dynasties , Alec said , which was the truth but not the salient truth . The salient truth was that the civic life of the nation held no attraction . He preferred Shakespeare 's life to the life of any one of his kings or pretenders , tormented men always grasping for that thing just out of reach . Deluded men . Men adrift on a sea of troubles , some of their own making , some not . In any case , the Fates were in charge , part of the human equation along with ambition and restlessness . Alec was satisfied with his photography and his reveries , including the mundane , the look of ordinary things and the time of day , what the weather was like outside and who was present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bright sunlight , red and yellow roses proliferating . Life 's excitement lay just outside the frame of reference , grandeur felt but not seen yet grandeur all the same . Alec 's reveries were his way of bringing life down to earth , so to speak . <p> It is reliably reported that the people of Milan , where Verdi lay dying in the winter of 1901 , put sheaves of straw in the street outside his hotel to deaden the sound of horses ' hooves so that the great composer might have peace in his last days . Alec liked to believe that Verdi was composing a melody up to the end , another opera or requiem , surprised that his street was so quiet ; annoyed , perhaps , because he was accustomed to commotion , shouts , arguments , even a burst of song . Alec imagined the residents of the neighborhood laying straw before dawn , even the children . Verdi honored the Milanese by choosing the hotel and they would repay the honor . If God granted him another month he would give them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's plan , then at least the maestro would have silence . That was the least they could do . Verdi had given them much pleasure , many occasions for laughter and tears , cries of Bravo ! And his own life had been marked by terrible tragedy , his wife and young children dying within a few years of one another . Verdi found happiness and repose in his music . The Requiem alone was sufficient for any man 's creative life on this earth . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
