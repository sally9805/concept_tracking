Samuel Mockbee is eager to show off the buildings his Rural Studio has designed throughout Hale County , Ala . Driving his pickup truck , he barrels past catfish farms , abandoned barns and sleepy towns , pointing out houses and community structures along the way . Even the 100degree temperature and nearly 100% humidity do n't seem to slow him down . It is only when he reaches the hamlet of Mason 's Bend and the home of Alberta Bryant that this bear of a man with a bushy graying beard slips into low gear and momentarily seems to surrender to the heat . Plopping down on Bryant 's couch , Mockbee rests his straw hat to the side and catches up with one of his studio 's earliest clients . <P> Bryant is not your typical home buyer . She is very poor , and previously lived in a decrepit shack with openings large enough to allow animals to walk through . But Mockbee , 55 , is not your average architect . A recent recipient of a " genius " grant from the MacArthur Foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a man with a mission . Rural Studio finds people and communities in need of buildings and , using inexpensive and unusual materials , designs structures that are practical and affordable , but at the same time unconventionally beautiful . <P> A Mississippi native and graduate of Auburn 's architecture school , Mockbee has long been troubled by the poverty found in the South . He got his first hands-on experience with low-cost housing in the early 1980s , when he worked in Canton , Miss. , with a nun who was finding homes for that area 's poor . <P> In 1993 , now teaching at Auburn , he used what he had learned in Canton to develop the Rural Studio . Mockbee sees the studio , which is financed by the university and such philanthropic groups as the Alabama Power Foundation , as a way to train a new generation of students in his belief that " architecture is a social art . It has to function in an ethical , moral way to help people . " <P> Rural Studio has been dubbed Redneck Taliesin South and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the studio have more design freedom than students at Frank Lloyd Wright 's famed Taliesin studios . And unlike Habitat , which to date has built 100,000 affordable houses , the Rural Studio turns out only a few handcrafted homes , farmers ' markets and community buildings each year . <P> Hale is an ideal laboratory for the studio 's architectural experiment . This region of west-central Alabama is one of the poorest stretches in the nation . The writer James Agee and the photographer Walker Evans passed the summer of 1936 here while preparing their Depression-era classic Let Us Now Praise Famous Men . While prosperity has come to parts of this area , the region is still dotted with the shacks chronicled in Evans ' haunting photographs . <P> The Bryant House exemplifies the studio 's approach to affordable housing . After Mockbee asked Bryant and her husband Shepard if he could build a home for them , he introduced the couple to some of the Auburn architecture students assigned to the project . The students quizzed the family about how many bedrooms it needed as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then started on the house .
