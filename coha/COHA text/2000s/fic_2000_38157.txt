DO N'T THINK OF IT AS laying off workers , " the Devil told his Chief Executive Officer , Punky Wilkenfeld , a large round man with bloodshot eyes and wobbly knees . " I think of it as downsizing to a more user-friendly mode of production . I guess what I 'm saying , Punky , is that we ca n't spend all eternity thinking about nothing more important than the bottom line . Maybe it 's finally time to kick back , reflect on our achievements , and start enjoying some of that well-deserved R &R; we 've promised ourselves for so long . " <p> As always , the Devil tried to be reasonable . But this did n't prevent his long-devoted subordinate from weeping copiously into his worsted vest . " What will I do ? " Punky asked himself over and over again . " Where will I go ? All this time I thought you loved me because I was really , really evil . Now I realize you only kept me around because , oh God . For you it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Devil folded his long forked tail into his belt and checked himself out in the wall-sized vanity mirror behind his desk . He was wearing a snappy handmade suit by Vuiton , gleaming Cordovan leather shoes , and prescription Ray-Bans . The Devil had long been aware that it was n't enough to be good at what you did . In order for people to know it , you had to look good , as well . <p> Roger " Punky " Wilkenfeld lay drooped over the edge of the Devil 's desk like a very old gardenia . The Devil could n't help himself . He really loved this guy . <p> " What can I tell you , Roger ? " the Devil said , as gently as he could . " Eventually it comes time for everybody to move on , and so in this particular instance , I 'll blaze the trail , and leave you and the boys to pack things up in your own good time . Just be sure to lock up when you leave . " <p> THE DEVIL WENT to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coast , sold off his various penthouses and Tuscan villas , and settled into the reflective life as easily as an anemone in a tide pool . <p> Every day he walked to the local grocery for fresh fruits and vegetables , took long strolls into the dry amber hills , or rented one of the Nouvelle Vague classics he 'd always meant to watch from Blockbuster . He disdained malls , televised sports , and corporate-owned franchise restaurants . He tore up his credit cards , stopped worrying about the bottom line , and never once opened his mail . <p> In his heyday , the devil had enjoyed the most exotic pleasures that could be devised by an infinite array of saucy , fun-loving girls named Delilah . But until he met Melanie , he had never actually known true love . <p> " I guess it 's because love takes time , " the Devil reflected , on the night they first slept together on the beach . " And time has never been something I 've had too much of . Bartering for souls , keeping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so forth . And then , as if that 's not enough , having to deal with all the endless constant whining . Oh please , Master , please take my soul , please grant me unlimited wealth and fame and eternal youth and sex with any gal in the office , I 'll do anything you ask , please please . When a guy 's in the damnation game , he never gets a moment 's rest . If I 'd met you five years ago , Mel ? I do n't think I 'd have stopped working long enough to realize what a wonderful , giving person you really are . But I 've got the time now , baby . Come here a sec . I 've definitely got lots of time for you now . " <p> They moved in together . They had children - a girl and a boy . They shopped at the Health Food Co-Op , campaigned for animal rights , and installed in energy efficient Aga in the kitchen . They even canceled the lease on the Devil 's Volvo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These turned out to be the most wonderful and relaxing days the Devil had ever known . <p> Then , one afternoon when the Devil was sorting recyclable materials into their appropriate plastic bins , he received a surprise visitor from his past . Melanie had just taken the kids to Montessori . The Devil had been looking forward all day to catching up with his chores . <p> " How they hanging , big boy ? I guess I imagined all sorts of comeuppances for a useless old fart like yourself , but certainly never this . Wasting your once-awesome days digging through garbage . Cleaning the windows and mowing the lawn . " <p> When the Devil looked up , he saw Punky Wilkenfeld climbing out of a two-door Corvette . Clad in one of the Devil 's old suits , he looked slightly out of place amidst so much expensive retailoring . Some guys know how to hang clothes , the Devil thought . And some guys just do n't . <p> " Why , Punky , " the Devil said softly , not without affection . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pal . But they do n't call me Punky anymore . " <p> " Oh no ? " The Devil absently licked a bit of stale egg from his forepaw . " Nope . These days , people call me Mr. Wilkenfeld . Or better yet , the Eternal Lord of Darkness and Pain . " <p> " It 's like this , Pop , " Punky continued over Red Zinger tea in the breakfast room . " When you took off , you left a trillion hungry mouths to feed . Mouths with razor-sharp teeth . Mouths with multitudinously  --  forked tongues . Frankly , I did n't know what to do , so I turned the whole kit-and-kaboodle over to the free-market-system and just let it ride .. We went on the Dow in March , and by summer we 'd bought out two of our closest rivals - Microsoft and ITT . I even hear Mr. Hot-Shot Heavenly Father 's been doing a little diversifying . Does n't matter to me , either . Whoever spends it , it 's all money . " <p> " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Punky , " the Devil said graciously . " I mean , excuse me . Mr. Wilkenfeld . " <p> Punky finished his tea with a long , parched swallow . " Ahh , " he said , and hammered the mug down with a short rude bang . " I guess I just wanted you to know that I have n't forgotten you , Pops . In fact , I 've even bought this little strip of beach you call home , and once we 've finished erecting the new condos , we 'll move on to offshore oil rigs , docking facilities , maybe even a yachting club or two . Basically , Pop , I 'm turning your life into scrap metal . Nothing to do with business , either . I just personally hate your guts . " <p> The Devil gradually grew aware of a dim beeping sound . With a sigh , Punky reached into his vest pocket and deactivated his digital phone with a brisk little flick . <p> " Probably my broker , " Punky said . " He calls at least six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former charge d'affaires , whose soft pink lips were beaded with perspiration and bad faith . Poor Punky , the Devil thought . Some guys just never learn . <p> " And wants know the best thing about this shoreline redevelopment project , Pop ? There 's absolutely nothing you can do about it . You take it to the courts - I own them . You take it to the Board of Supervisors - I own them . You organize eight million sit-down demonstrations and I pave the whole damn lot of you over with bulldozers . That 's the real pleasure of dealing dirt to you born-again types , Pop . You got ta be good . But I do n't . " <p> The Devil watched Punky stand , brush himself off , and reach for his snakeskin briefcase . Then , as if seeking a balance to this hard , unaccommodating vision , he looked out his picture window at the hardware equipment littering his back yard . The Devil had been intending to install aluminum siding all week , and he hated to see unfulfilled projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One second , " the Devil said . " I 'll be right back . " <p> " Sorry , Pop , but this is one CEO who believes in full-steam-ahead , toot toot ! Keep in touch , guy . Unless , that is , I keep touch with you first - 11 But of course before Punky reached the front door the Devil had already returned from his back yard with the shearing scissors . And Punky , who had belonged to the managerial classes for more eons than he cared to remember , was slow to recognize any instrument used in the performance of manual labor . <p> " Hey , Pop , that 's more like it , " Punky said slowly , the wrong sun dawning from the wrong hills . " I could use a little grooming if only to remind us both who 's boss . Here , see , at the edge of this cloven hoof ? What does that look like to you ? A hangnail ? " <p> Punky had crouched down so low that it almost resembled submission . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a million tiny bits . <p> " Seagulls do n't mind what they eat , " the Devil reflected later . He was standing at the end of a long wooden pier , watching white birds dive into the frothy red water . " Which is probably why they remind me so much of men . " <p> The Devil wondered idly if his life had a moral . If it did , he decided , it was probably this : <p> Just because people change their lives for the better does n't mean they 're stupid . <p> Then , remembering it was his turn to do bouillabaisse , the Devil turned his back on the glorious sunset and went home . <p>
