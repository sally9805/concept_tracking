Mars steals the show and Ceres celebrates 200 years . // Several planetary matinees are showing this month . It 's not often you get a chance to see Venus and Saturn side by side , and during daylight hours on July 15th they pair up in the same eyepiece field . In the following week , the moon crosses in front of four planets . This occultation series starts off with South Americans watching the moon cover up Saturn on the morning of July 17th . The marquee event for North Americans happens a few hours later when Venus succumbs to the moon 's bright limb and reappears from behind the nearly invisible side . Indonesians have a chance to see Jupiter occulted mid-morning on the 19th . Not to be outdone , Mercury performs a lunar disappearance on the 19th for global citizens in a strip from northern Europe across the north pole to western Canada . At night , Mars commands the southern sky , a blazing orange orb nestled in front of the Milky Way . But the triumphant God of War must accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed . Starting this month Mars begins to noticeably fade and shrink . Observe it as often as you can to get the most from the tapestry of its subtle surface detail . By summer 's end , its increasing distance from Earth will challenge your skills to the core . Notice the phase of the moon when it passes Mars and Antares on the 2nd and 29th . The moon is noticeably less full at the end of the month . The ancients , using the stars as background reference points , recognized that the moon circled Earth in about 27.3 days . The longer lunar month ( from one full moon to the next ) of 29.5 days is needed for the moon to catch up with the sun-Earth line . Finding the gas giant Neptune is easier than you may think . At 8th magnitude , it 's within range of 7 x 50 binoculars and a snap in a 4-inch scope . Just follow the map on page 63 . Will this be your first summer to see the beautiful but elusive noctilucent clouds ? Last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wispy , 50-mile-high nighttime clouds . Some scientists consider it a sign of global climate change . On your next dark summer night , walk away from the campfire to bathe in the glow of our galaxy : the Milky Way . Billions of distant stars shine in unison to produce the celestial river that courses through so many of humanity 's mythologies . Discover the many deep-sky treasures - star clusters and nebulae - embedded along its vast shorelines as you slowly peruse it with binoculars . Butterflies on a Summer 's Night If the splendor of the Milky Way is like a field of white flowers in an alpine meadow on a summer 's day , then the beautiful star clusters M6 and M7 are the prominent butterflies floating in the sky . Located halfway between Scorpius 's stinger and the tip of Sagittarius 's teapot spout , they are easy naked-eye puffs to spot from a dark sky .

Although he has received credit for the discoveries , chances are these nebulous spots have been recognized since the dawn of humanity , when curious eyes first began watching the skies . From the northern vantage points of Europe and Canada , Sagittarius and Scorpius unfortunately wallow in the horizon murk , forcing observers to use binoculars to get a glimpse . On the other hand , small backyard telescopes instantly reveal the wondrous collection of bright stars scattered across each field . The northern cluster , M6 , was nicknamed the " butterfly " by French astronomer Camille Flammarion . He enthusiastically described the bright stellar group as " one of the most attractive clusters in the heavens for small instruments , a completely charming group whose arrangement suggests the outline of a butterfly with open wings . " The southernmost cluster of the two , M7 , is richer in brighter stars and readily resolves with binoculars . Should you ever get the chance to travel south , make sure these two clusters top your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starfields of the Milky Way flowing behind M7 elude description . Globular Grazing As you follow the asteroid Ceres this month , you 'll run into a round , gray fuzz . This is the distant globular star cluster Charles Messier numbered 54 . At low power in a small scope , M54 shows no sign of individual stars . In a dark sky with a 10-inch scope at high power , you may begin to spot some granularity as its 15th-magnitude stars pop in and out of view . The great 19th-century observer John Herschel was able to resolve M54 into countless stars using his lower-tech 18-inch polished metal mirror . Next , swing your scope over to M22 , one of the sky 's best ( and closest ) globulars , just northeast of the star at the top of Sagittarius 's teapot lid . Its brightest stars shine at magnitude 10.7 , easily within reach of a 4-inch scope . An 8- to 10-inch scope at 250x allows you to resolve stars right in the core . Mars and Neptune at Their Best The month of July opens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high in the south-southeast shortly after sunset . Mars is at its best for June and July and better than it has been for a decade . Mars outshines its neighbor , Antares , 7 deg to the west . The Red Planet 's magnitude soars to - 2.1 . On July 2 the three objects , Mars , the moon , and Antares , form a noticeable triangle that attracts attention . Photograph Globular cluster M22 provides one of the finest sights in Sagittarius . Jack Newton Photograph The bright star clusters M6 and M7 lie amid a rich Scorpius Milky Way star field that is ideally suited for binoculars . Jason wars // Mars puts on a fine display this month and is well-placed for viewing . It shines brightly in the southern region of the constellation Ophiuchus , the 13th and often overlooked constellation of the zodiac . Mars passed opposition on June 20 , marking the middle of its best period for viewing . Spanning 20 " on July 1 and shrinking to 17 " by July 31 , its apparent size diminishes rapidly as Earth pulls ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to observe this orange  --  hued world . Telescopically , Mars represents the biggest challenge of all the planets due to its small size . Medium-sized telescopes ( 8 inches and up ) will show Mars quite well , but larger scopes offer much more . Remember that the apparent size of Mars is smaller than the crater Copernicus on the moon . Check out the moon to give yourself an idea of what to expect when viewing Mars . During the first two days of July you 'll find the magnitude 7 globular cluster , M19 , lying north of Mars and within the same low-power telescopic view . Within days , Mars moves farther west in its reverse ( retrograde ) path , caused by Earth 's orbit overtaking that of Mars . Features on Mars prove fascinating to follow . Each night a similar face presents itself to observers , due to the almost identical rotation period of Mars compared with Earth . In early July , the dark feature called Solis Lacus appears .

By the third week , Syrtis Major slips from view , and the bright region called Hellas dominates , perhaps to be mistaken for a polar ice cap . Photograph Venus hangs out with winter stars in the predawn sky on July 25 , 1993 . Jerry Schad // If you 've never seen Neptune before , this month presents your best chance to spot it . Neptune passes very close to the magnitude 5.1 star , Upsilon ( Upsilon ) Capricorni , easily found in binoculars or by the unaided eye from dark sites . Check the location of Upsilon Cap using a star chart . Pointing your scope in that direction , you will see Neptune as well . Upsilon Cap is a red star , providing a lovely color contrast with Neptune 's distinct blue cast . Neptune is much fainter , shining at magnitude 7.8 . On July 20 , the giant planet passes a mere 5 " south of Upsilon Cap - an excellent opportunity to see a distant planet move slowly relative to a background star from night to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky ) on July 30 when it lies 2.7 billion miles from Earth . Uranus is almost as easy to find as Neptune , and that 's because it lies 20 north of Deneb Algedi , the magnitude 2.8 star at the northeastern end of Capricornus . The seventh planet brightens to magnitude 5.7 in time for next month 's opposition . Look for the three distinctive stars of 5th and 6th magnitude in a straight line to the north of Deneb Algedi . Uranus moves closer to the lower pair , showing an ever-changing aspect of the triangle formed between the planet and the two stars . In early August Uranus passes between the lower pair . Tremendous planetary action occurs in July 's early morning skies . Three brilliant planets pop over the eastern horizon before dawn . Venus rises first , shining brilliantly at magnitude - 4.1 . It lies 6 deg south of the Pleiades for a few days around Independence Day ( July 4 ) . Saturn rises shortly after Venus as dawn breaks in early July , but watch them on following mornings as Venus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line-of-sight effect , of course , but very photogenic even so . Saturn shines at magnitude 0.2 . By July 15 , only a 43 " gap of sky separates the two planets , though in reality Saturn is 820 million miles farther away . The spectacular pairing , combined with the backdrop of the Hyades and Aldebaran , rises three hours before the sun . The duo of Venus and Saturn on July 15 is a warm-up for the spectacular view that awaits the early riser on July 17 when a lovely crescent moon joins them . Aldebaran also lies nearby , and all four objects ( Venus , Saturn , the moon , and Aldebaran ) lie within a 4 deg circle . Watch between 4 A.M. and 5 A.M. local time for the best view , by which time Jupiter rises . Later the same day , during daylight on July 17 , the crescent moon occults Venus for observers across the entire United States . The event takes place about noon for observers in the Mountain Daylight time zone , earlier for those farther west , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jupiter rises 1 hour and 40 minutes before sunrise . It 's quite obvious at magnitude - 1.9 , even in a brightening sky . Mercury joins Jupiter for a few days , passing 1.9 deg south of Jupiter on July 13 , at magnitude 0 . Mercury reaches greatest elongation west of the sun on July 9 at magnitude 0.4 and brightens each day . By July 17 it shines at magnitude - 0.9 and lies only 45 ' southeast of the slim crescent moon . Later the same day the moon occults Mercury for observers in Alaska and the extreme northwestern United States . Summer Meteors The end of July is particularly active for a number of minor meteor showers . This month is also the time of the early build-up for one of the strongest performers of the year , the Perseid meteor shower . Included in the activity is the Delta Aquarids during the last week of July , which can produce up to 20 meteors an hour . The Alpha Capricornids often produce bright , slow fireballs , but both showers are affected strongly by moonlight through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming of the Perseid shower after July 17. // Central Meridian Longitudes on Mars Photograph // Parry Crater Lying in the western region of the moon , south of Mare Nubium , is a collection of three fragmented craters : Fra Mauro , Bonpland , and Parry . The sun rises on this section of the moon shortly after first quarter . Fra Mauro was made famous when the Apollo 14 astronauts , Alan Shepard and Ed Mitchell , landed just a few miles north of the fragmented crater . Thirty-mile  --  long Parry is the youngest and most complete of the three craters in this area , although its southeastern wall is broken by a rifle . A small craterlet impinges its southwestern wall , and a prominent rifle running north-south along the inner western wall shows up in most scopes . Sunset on Parry , which occurs near last quarter , is dramatic , and if the timing is right you 'll see the pointed shadows of the crater walls . Watch for 30 minutes or so to spot the amazing changes in shadow lengths . The crater walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicative of its significant age compared to a crisp , fresh crater such as Copernicus , which lies to the north . There 's no central peak , but here 's a challenge : Can you spot the two tiny craters on the flat crater floor ? You wo n't be able to see the Apollo 14 site , nor the nearby site where Apollo 12 set down . Ceres Celebrates Two Centuries Since Its Discovery Two hundred years ago , on the night of January 1 , 1801 , the Italian monk Giuseppe Piazzi discovered the last piece of the solar system puzzle : the " missing planet " that was thought to lie between Mars and Jupiter . Instead it turned out to be piece number one of the asteroid belt . At 625 miles ( 1000 km ) across , Ceres is the largest of the rocky , irregular bodies . Even if you took Ceres and all the tens of thousands of asteroids discovered since then and compacted them , the result would be considerably smaller than Mars . Photograph Parry crater ( arrow ) offers rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As far as we know , the streets of Palermo , Italy , on that night were not disturbed by echoing shouts of " Eureka ! " We might presume the moment was marked like many significant discoveries , with some sort of , " Hmm , that 's odd . " Piazzi noticed a star out of place and the following night recognized that it had moved . In essence , this is how we still find asteroids today , by their motion against the background sky , but with digital cameras instead of our eyes . From an urban backyard with a 3- or 4-inch scope , you can readily jump over to Ceres near the base of the teapot asterism in Sagittarius . Luckily , in this area not many stars shine brighter than Ceres 's magnitude 7.5 . Just to be sure , make a quick sketch and return a day or two later to see which " star " moved . On the evening of the 7th , Ceres forms a tight pair with a brighter 6.3  --  magnitude star to its south . From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south ( a bit less than half the moon 's apparent diameter ) from Zeta ( Zeta ) Sag , the lower left star of the teapot . The largest asteroid gives us a treat on the evening of the 25th when it grazes the southern flank of the bright Sagittarius globular star cluster M54 . Ceres will outshine any of the cluster stars , whose brightest members glow at 15th magnitude . While you are checking out Neptune in Capricornus ( see page 63 ) , take a couple minutes to catch asteroid 20 Massalia . On the 27th , Massalia passes a mere 2 ' south of a 6.5-magnitude companion to Rho ( Rho ) Cap . At magnitude 9.9 , Massalia is more of a challenge than Neptune , but with Rho Cap as a signpost , you should be able to nail it without much trouble . This is a perfect opportunity to watch an asteroid move in as little time as an hour . Noctilucent Clouds No longer the sole domain of the northern skywatcher , the most delicate and majestic phenomenon of the twilight sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , observers in Colorado reported noctilucent clouds . These ephemeral waves and whorls float near Earth 's menopause , some 50 miles ( 80 km ) up , joining the realm of meteors and aurorae . Noctilucent clouds form when water vapor condenses onto meteoric dust to form ice crystals . This is why they look somewhat like the more pedestrian , wispy ice-crystal cirrus clouds . Noctilucent clouds are so thin that they are invisible in daylight , appearing only when the background sky is sufficiently dark . A popular but as yet unproved conjecture is that global warming is affecting the upper atmosphere 's temperature structure , allowing noctilucent clouds to spread much farther south than usual . Keep on the lookout for delicate , cloudy veils that glow with a lovely bluish-white hue . This comes in stark contrast to regular clouds that appear dark against the twilight glow : The sun has set for normal clouds . Noctilucent clouds become visible only in summer and when the sun sits between 6 deg and 12 deg below the horizon , either in the northwest or northeast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under moonlight because normal cirrus clouds can masquerade as noctilucent clouds .
