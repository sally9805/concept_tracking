<p> The crossroads of Bethelview Road and Atlanta Highway in Forsyth County is n't a particularly friendly stretch to walk . <p> Construction trucks , beat up pickups and high-end SUVs roar by , spewing fumes . There 's little to look at but strip centers , thousands of cigarette butts and dead vines that snake up through the rusting street signs . <p> It 's fitting , if of course unintentional . This is a crossroads with an unfriendly past . <p> Twenty years ago Wednesday , at this very spot , hundreds of white segregationists set upon a group of determined black people who had come to this mostly white county for what they called a " brotherhood march " to commemorate the newly minted Martin Luther King Jr . federal holiday . <p> The whites lining the then-desolate intersection hurled insults , rocks and bottles , causing serious injury only to the American illusion that , nearly a quarter-century after the passage of the landmark Civil Rights Act banning racial discrimination in public accommodations and facilities , maybe the country was past such rancor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country poured into the then-rural county of about 36,000 people , sparking the largest civil rights protest since the 1960s and putting Forsyth County in a spotlight that still burns at the psyche of some of its longtime residents . <p> " People do n't like to talk about it , " said local historian Annette Bramblett , who is white . " The county is constantly being portrayed inaccurately . " <p> What happened in Forsyth County might have happened in a number of places . That it occurred in Forsyth was a matter of happenstance . But it also reflected the county 's history . <p> " In 1912 , in one month , Forsyth County 's entire African-American population , over 1,000 citizens , was driven systematically from the county in the wake of the rape and murder of a white woman and the lynching of her accused assailant , " Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun wrote in deciding a case that arose from the aftermath of the 1987 marches . <p> Shock of the moment <p> At the time of the marches , the county was virtually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birthday with a march through a county where blacks were said to be not welcomed was all the motivation the late civil rights leader Hosea Williams needed . <p> He did n't hesitate to organize a group to take the trip north to Forsyth County . <p> State Rep. Tyrone Brooks did n't attend the first march . He said he did n't think it would " amount to anything . " <p> What protesters saw when they arrived that chilly , breezy morning said otherwise . <p> " It was an awesome sight , " said former state Rep. Billy McKinney , who was there . " The whole hill on one side of the roadway was filled with people . " <p> " We started to walk , slowly , with the bus driving behind us . Rocks , bricks and bottles started raining down on us , " he said . <p> No one was seriously hurt , but the open hostility was shocking . News of the incident spread quickly , and before the day had ended , plans were being made to return . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary people from across the country , garnering national attention and seemingly sentencing Forsyth to a lifetime reputation as the place where black people were n't welcome . <p> Herman Heard , a longtime barber in Cumming , says the county did n't deserve the spotlight . <p> " The only reason Hosea Williams came here was to stir things up so he could get more money for the NAACP , " said Heard , who is white . " I do n't think the march had any bearing on anything . We were scapegoats . The people throwing the rocks and bottles came from Fulton County , Dawson County , and other places and we still get blamed . " <p> The landscape today <p> Today , Forsyth County is a place where families earn twice the national median income and spend like they mean to show it . Entire subdivisions of $700,000 homes are not uncommon . <p> " In 1987 , we thought the county was doomed , and no one would ever want to move here , " school superintendent Paula Gault said . " Obviously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live there now  --  only one in five has been there since the 1980s , local officials estimate , and it 's still one of the nation 's fastest-growing counties . It 's politically conservative , too : President Bush carried Forsyth with 83 percent of voters in 2004 , the highest support among any Georgia county , according to the state Republican Party . <p> But despite the growth and the wealth , Forsyth also is still partly rural  --  with rusting chicken coops , squat houses and trailers . <p> It 's still overwhelmingly white . Black residents accounted for 1.8 percent of the population in Forsyth County in 2005 , according to the U.S. Census Bureau . <p> A new outlook <p> And it 's still a place where , even last week , an old-timer at the county courthouse feels comfortable enough to drop a racial slur into casual conversation with a white reporter . Unlike when Forsyth was mostly rural , the openly menacing attitudes toward minorities are long gone , said Ozell Sutton of Atlanta , a retired U.S. Justice Department official who monitored the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Blacks do n't seem to live in fear if they live out there , " said Sutton , who is black . <p> Perhaps nothing illustrates that point as well as the experience of Carmona Gibbs , a black Muslim who carefully researched Forsyth County and knew all about the history and decided to move there anyway . <p> " We thought , if it 's a racist place , we 'll help make the change , " Gibbs said . <p> She said she sometimes feels stares at the grocery store , but wonders if it 's as much the head scarf she sometimes wears more than her skin tone . Either way , her infant twins often help break the ice . <p> " People have been cordial and friendly , which surprised me because of what everyone was saying and what I saw on the Net , " Gibbs said . " I have n't encountered any racism . I expected some . I 'm a black Muslim in a scarf . Most people told me I would have a hard time .

She owns her own legal services business , is active in the local chamber of commerce and mentors at a local school . <p> " You 're going to encounter idiots wherever you are . But , as far as someone calling me the n-word , no , that 's never happened , " she said . <p> And what of white attitudes ? <p> Canadian Sandra Campbell owns the Country Gourmet diner in downtown Cumming . <p> " If someone of a different race comes in , no one stops and stares , " Campbell said .
