I KISS THE RING OF MY LATE MOTHER-IN-LAW when I need help With her difficult son-when he paces the house at night shouting at the rats that are n't there , or panics , fearful that the floor is falling in , that the roof is blowing off , that the neighbors are talking about him . I ask her to send me an angel helper when I must calm him and put him to bed . <p> I 'm afraid that if I am in a car wreck , Merilyn 's diamond will be stolen from me while I lie unconscious : grave robbers before I 'm dead . I wonder if I should hide it in a safe , but when Linky 's oupa told the burglars that nobody had keys to the safe-that the house had been bought ten years ago and the previous owners had lost the key , and that there was nothing in the safe anyway-the guy with the gold-capped front tooth said , We 'll press you to talk , Oupa , and plugged the iron in , good and hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shat himself and his heart gave in . He died in his own excrement while they searched his garage , fetched his wrench , his blowtorch . They ripped the safe out of the wall , bust it open , and found only dust and silence . <p> I love this ring too much not to wear it . I 've told my family to order an autopsy if I am murdered ; let a surgeon search my stomach because with my dying breath I will swallow this stone whole . I practice slipping it off quickly-it 's become a tic . My husband kisses my head when he sees me do that . Do n't drop it down a grate , he says . I remind him a thief will have to disembowel me for it . <p> Author Affiliation
