<p> Pete Wilson , the TV news anchor with the best exasperated sigh in the business , died unexpectedly Friday night , a day after having a heart attack during hip replacement surgery . <p> Wilson , 62 , underwent the surgery at Stanford Hospital late Thursday and suffered a massive heart attack . Doctors battled to keep him alive until Friday night , when he was taken off life support . He succumbed at 9:20 p.m . <p> " He was just walking out the door a couple of days ago , " said KGO-TV colleague Wayne Freedman . " Looking forward to getting this taken care of and getting back out on the golf course . " <p> The hip replacement was Wilson 's second . He had one about 12 years ago , according to family spokesman Chapin Day . Oddly enough , in 2005 another well-known Bay Area broadcaster , sports announcer Bill King , also died following surgery to repair his artificial hip . <p> Wilson was a Bay Area institution .

Although he won six local Emmys and two prestigious Peabody awards , TV viewers will probably remember him above all for his on-air demeanor . <p> Other news anchors read the news . Wilson instructed you . He gave you the impression he had some things to tell you , and you 'd be wise to sit up , pipe down and pay attention . And , if it was one of those stories that piqued his ever-vigilant sense of outrage , there was likely to be eye-rolling , deep sighs , and even some head-shaking at the ridiculousness of it all . <p> " Pete somehow had the ability to convey that he had some questions about what he was about to tell you , " said KGO-TV News Director Kevin Keeshan . <p> " What you saw is what you got with Pete , " said longtime friend and colleague Vic Lee .

Or a potential travesty . " <p> The remarks caused an outcry in the Bay Area , with several members of the Board of Supervisors demanding that Wilson be fired . Wilson addressed the issue on his show , insisting that he supported both same-sex marriage and adoption for same-sex couples , but never apologized . He did , however , say his language was " inappropriate . " <p> Although the controversy eventually died down , his objectivity was often the subject of discussion . Some wondered how Wilson could be an objective news anchor and an opinionated radio talk-show host at the same time . <p> The answer , say friends , was simple . He was n't either one  --  he was just Pete .

They called them " Pete 's rants . " <p> And if you really wanted to see passion , you should have played golf with him . <p> " You could hear him coming two holes away , " Freedman says . " He did his own play-by-play and color commentary . " <p> What might not come through in those stories was the sense of affection with which they were told . It is n't easy to be both extremely opinionated and well-liked , but Wilson seemed to pull it off . <p> " He was unbelievably loyal , " Freedman said . " I was always trying to get him to join my golf club . He was always talking about it , but I got the sense that he did n't want to leave his regular foursome .

" It said ' Pete Wilson . ' He just hung them there and never said a word . " <p> A passionate student of politics , Wilson probably would have gotten a huge kick out of a misunderstanding that arose from his death . A rumor spread that former California Gov . Pete Wilson had died . Sean Walsh , former press secretary to the former governor , was contacted by a San Diego newspaper and said he had " no idea " how the rumor started . That 's because he was n't in the Bay Area . When people around here heard that Pete Wilson died , their first thought was n't that it was the politician . They thought , instead , that it was the local media institution . <p> " There 's a seat over here in the newsroom where he sat , " Freedman said . " And nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time . " <p> A Vietnam veteran and Mill Valley resident , Wilson was born in Wisconsin in April 1945 and graduated from the University of Wisconsin in journalism and creative writing . He began his broadcasting career at a small country-western station in Milwaukee while going to graduate school . <p> Keeshan said Wilson was nervous about the surgery . <p> " He was a little apprehensive , " Keeshan said . " He dedicated the last half hour of his radio show to it and basically had people call up and give their nightmare stories about hip replacement surgery . That was kind of Pete 's way of dealing with it . " <p> Even before the surgery , Wilson was already looking forward to getting back in the anchor chair , Keeshan said . <p> " One of the last conversations I had with him ( Friday ) was about cutting a hole in the floor under the anchor desk " so Wilson could keep his legs straight while recuperating from the surgery , Keeshan said .

Politicians and reporters do n't always agree , and we have two different jobs to do . " <p> In a statement , San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom said , " While I did not share his views on many issues , I speak for all San Franciscans when I say that our hearts go out to the Wilson family during this difficult time of loss . " <p> Wilson is survived by his wife , Sandra , and son , Brendan . A public service is pending .
