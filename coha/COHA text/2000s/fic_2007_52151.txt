IT WAS GOOD RIDDANCE THAT PUT Adrian Littlefield on the lecture circuit . Before Riddance he 'd self-published a couple pastel-covered self-help books with fashionably gerundial titles-Learning to Love in the Present Tense and Making the Best of the Worst case Scenarios . They were widely ignored and only sold to his family and folks at the church where he youth-pastored back in those early years of marriage and parenthood . He 'd done a workbook on dividing family duties between spouses and written a couple of articles for the ministerial press but otherwise was going nowhere and barely making ends meet until , after she left him , he wrote Good Riddance : Divorcing for Keeps and it changed his life . It held that some divorces , like some marriages , are made in heaven . And we ought to be thankful for them . The key to living in concert with God 's Will or the Natural Order or what the Fates had in mind for you was to learn to accept the direction in which your love life was taking you , even when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of neither too much of one thing nor too little of another , too many heartbreaks or too few . It was , like tsunamis and famines , hurricanes and genocides , God 's way of culling humanity 's herd of lovers , for reasons that were unknowable to mortals , but part , nonetheless , of a larger plan . Shit happens , Adrian Littlefield told his readers unambiguously ; we must go with the flow . That 's life , get over it , get on with it . It took him three weeks to write it , a month to get an agent , and another month to get a contract and a fat advance from a publisher in New York . It was an immediate hit . The first printing sold out in a week . The paperback rights went for a quarter million . The invitations followed . He worked up a little forty-minute shtick for the keynotes and workshops . He could bend his presentation , peppered with tastefully suggestive humor , around the occupational curiosities of any professional association . He had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and did a little chalk talk with a really attractive and earnest-looking studio audience-in postproduction . He traveled three months out of every four from his home office in Findlay , Ohio , where he housed , next to his Victorian farmhouse , in a barn he 'd refurbished with money from his books , The Center for Postmarital Studies-an elaborate tax shelter , along with the foundation that raised funds to advance the work of the CPMS , which was primarily to pay its principal apostle , himself , to spread the word such as it was revealed to him . Some nights , posting the latest newsletter to the Web site or linking a recent interview so his followers could listen in , he felt not a little like Paul writing to the various churches . If , as that great circuit-rider wrote , it is better to marry than to burn , was it not much better still to divorce than to smolder ? " Exes , " Adrian 's favorite slogan held , " you ca n't live with " em and you ca n't shoot " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In the years since Riddance was released , he 'd written The Good Riddance Workbook and Questions &; Answers About Good Riddance , thereby giving the trilogy his publisher said really would saturate the market . The more offers that came into the CPMS , the more he raised his fees for speaking , which had the effect of making him seem worth that much more , which brought , of course , more offers . He counted it an irony , and a pleasant one , that he 'd become a de facto itinerant preacher-the calling he 'd felt early and often in his youth-albeit one preaching a secularized gospel that was a hybrid of pop psychology , warm fuzzies , personal witness , and cultural study . That he homilized not from the pulpits of great cathedrals but from the lecterns of convention hotels struck him as part of the Creator 's plan for him . He 'd stopped saying " Gawd " in the deeply reverential tone of his Methodist training and taken rather to the user-friendly , guilt-free parlance of nature and creation . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Also it paid better . Likewise he 'd given up " The Reverend " in favor of " Doctor " Adrian Littlefield for the scholarly , vaguely medical ring that it added to his brief . He had acquired a D.D. , mail-ordered from one of the agencies that advertised in clergy magazines , and an honorary doctorate from his alma mater , Ohio Wesleyan , where he 'd given the commencement speech the year after his book came out . He was certainly not the first to observe that the high priests of the current culture had secular rather than sacred credentials . Not lost on him either was the happy fact that divorcing , formerly seen as a failure , had been the essential key to his success . Though the scandal cost him his job as the long-suffering and underpaid youth pastor at the Findlay United Methodist Church , as soon as his wife " left " him , he became the tragically abandoned single father of two young children . Once the book came out , with excerpts published in Redbook and Esquire , interviews on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd become a kind of local hero . He even did a sit-down with Oprah to chat and answer questions from the audience , which appearance alone had accounted for a massive third printing of Riddance and an audio book . When he found himself , as he often did , disembarking from some posh hotel , with the hefty stipend of his speaking fee cooling in his briefcase , the limo idling at curbside , waiting to take him to the plane , the appreciation of conventioneers ringing in his ears , and a young woman waking in the bed in the suite upstairs to find him gone but not , he could convince himself , entirely forgotten , Adrian Littlefield 's heart filled with thanksgiving for the failure he had made of his marriage . " All things , " he told himself , " work together toward some good . " If God was a practical joker , well then he would grin and bear it . He offered , in such moments , silent and abundant thanks and praise to Whomever Was In Charge and might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearts . It was the annual meeting of the National Association of Family Law Attorneys ( NAFLA ) in Connecticut that brought Adrian to the Foxwoods Resort Casino : a high-stakes bingo parlor parlayed by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation into one of the most profitable gaming parlors in the country . It rose out of the hilly forests between Norwich and the coast , like something out of " Kubla Khan , " its lights blazing in the darkness , a pleasure-dome on the " rez . " " Eighty-six thousand dollars an hour , twenty-four hours a day , 365 days .. . " the limo driver who met his flight in Hartford said ; " that 's how much they net in profit . Pretty good revenge , eh ? We gave them fire water and reservations , they give us keno and the dollar slots . They do n't call it wampum for nothing . " The shops and restaurants and conference center and hotel all played into the tribes master plan of revenge : to disencumber as many of their oppressors of as much money as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitable locale for the divorce attorneys to hold their annual meeting . Dr. Littlefield was the keynote speaker . His fee was fifteen thousand , first-class travel , ground transport , premium lodging , and meals . His books and videos sold briskly after his lectures . He signed them " Best Wishes-A . L. " ; and if the purchaser was a divorced woman of a certain age and style , he 'd add , " every available benevolence . " He thought this sounded a literary chord , and while what he wrote was far from literary , he thought the pretense would do no harm . In most cases he would fly into a venue the night before , check in , order a chicken salad from room service , watch a movie , and go to bed . He would be up early the next morning to walk , then ready himself for his standard fifty-minute speech , fifteen minutes of Q &A,; and whatever it took to sign all the books . Then he 'd make for the airport and the next venue . But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the sea in New England . He 'd been going nonstop for most of the year , and the pictures in the preregistration packet looked inviting . There was a " Traditional Yankee Clambake " scheduled at Mystic Seaport , the usual golf outing , and " A Day on Beautiful Block Island . " He 'd never been to Block Island , but he had kept a picture of the place in his imagination for years . The brochure photo of handsome couples assembled around fruity drinks , smiling from the porch of an elegant Victorian hotel caught his eye . He told the organizers he 'd be staying for the entire conference , and while he would n't golf with the attendees , he 'd be happy to eat with them and wanted to take the trip to the island . They were happy to book him two more nights in the suite knowing that their members would be pleased at the chance to visit with the renowned expert . The tour bus from Foxwoods to Point Judith took an hour . The boat from Point Judith to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Galilee , Rhode Island , to the town of New Shoreham at the Old Harbor . Stepping aboard the car ferry Anna C , Dr. Adrian Littlefield tried to imagine what crossing water must have added to the romance his former spouse must have felt en route to the first of her several assignations . He took a seat on the middle deck of the ferry among the conferees from NAFLA , who sat in a block in the first few rows of benches , but was careful to get an aisle seat for the escape he planned once the boat was on its way . They waited for cars and day-trippers to board , admiring the small fleet of fishing vessels in Point Judith . The Enterprise and Lady Helen and Stormy Elizabeth-it was not so much the names as the black riggings and booms and spools of netting that put him in mind of life 's entanglements . He thought he might begin another series of books entitled Life 's Entanglements . " Good Riddance was a miracle for me ! I have to tell you , Doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled at the red-haired woman sitting next to him , " that 's very flattering . " " No really , Doctor . It gave me permission to ... I hope I 'm not interrupting your ... " " No , no , not at all . I 'm glad you liked it . " " I mean before your book I never would have , you know , felt empowered . " She emphasized the middle syllable of " empowered " as she had with " permission . " " Yes , yes , " Adrian said , and looked deeply into her blue eyes trying to imagine what idiom from the lexicon of daytime talk shows she would give out with next , a scrutiny which the red-haired woman mistook for interest . Of course , there 's so much baggage we had to let go of first , my ex and me , before we could , you know , grow up and grow apart , you know , together . " Adrian nodded and smiled and stood and took her hand and held it meaningfully before looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Too much Java , " he said , to explain himself , and the man next to the red-haired woman pointed toward the rear of the ferryboat where they all had boarded . " Head 's at the back , Dr. Littlefield . We 'll save your spot . " Adrian smiled and made his move to the back of the boat just as it was disembarking and climbed the stairs to the open upper deck . Block Island was the site of his former wife 's first infidelity . He 'd only ever seen it in pictures : photos that she 'd brought home from her trip to New York that April , ostensibly to visit her friend Christina . " I just need to get away from Findlay and family and kids , " she told him , " just for a week , a little perker-upper . Christina has taken the time off of work ; we 're going to do girl things . " Clare was thirty-three at the time . They had a son and a daughter , ages eight and four . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palpable . " Oh , Ben invited us out to the island for the weekend , " she told him when she returned from the week away , having left him with the children and the house and his own work to manage . " You remember Ben , do n't you ? Uncle Harold 's friend , the artist . You know , Harold and Olive 's neighbor . Christina and I ran into him in Soho at the studio , and he invited us out to the island for the weekend . We could n't get theater tickets so we decided to go . Harold and Olive were going to come , too , but canceled at the last minute . " Adrian remembered the determinedly plural references and the way it seemed calculated to work against his suspicions . And the supposed serendipity of it all , all very last-minute and carpe diem , nothing planned . Clare labored to make everything sound like happenstance , which of course made her the more suspect . He rummaged through the photographs for any that included Christina . But there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ben in the kitchen , Ben and Clare smiling from their places at a table on the porch of what looked like an old hotel . The table was clearly set for two . Where , he wondered , was Christina ? Where were Harold and Olive ? Where were the photos of the " girl things " they had done ? Afraid of the answers , he never asked . He 'd met Ben once , the year they all drove east to visit Harold and Olive in Westchester . Harold was wealthy and worked in the city making investments for an insurance company . All of Harold and Olive 's friends were , like them , fiftyish , well off , fit , and always grinning . None of them smoked . They all took vitamins . Everyone observed some New Age regimen to guarantee a particular wellness . Ben was the **45;2457;TOOLONG next-door neighbor and artist , who lived on his earnings as an illustrator but was really just waiting to sell his oils . He was tall and smooth skinned and deeply tanned , and his white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'd done some covers for Life Magazine and the Saturday Evening Post . Clare had confessed to Adrian the crush she 'd had on Ben as a girl when visiting at her uncle 's after her parents " divorce ; Ben had made a fuss over her in some way she never elaborated , something to do with Rockefeller Center . He would have been in his thirties then , and she 'd always " felt really very flattered , you know , that he 'd make such a fuss over a fifteen-yearold girl . " Clare 's father had left when she was twelve , for reasons that were never made clear to her . One day he came in and said that he would always love her , and then he left . Her mother always looked a little wounded after that but never said a word about the divorce except , " I 'm a one-man woman , " which is why , Clare reasoned , her mother never remarried . After that they spent most summers and most Christmases with Uncle Harold and Aunt Olive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predictable to Adrian-the woman abandoned by her father as a child , looking for an older man 's approval , attention , etcetera-it was all embarrassingly usual , unremarkable in every way . They had arranged their little off-season tryst while Adrian , the earnest ignoramus , stayed home with the kids and the church work-the reliable , garden-variety cuckold and bumpkin . The Anna C. sounded its horn once and made its way out past the harbor 's bars and seafood restaurants , out past the sunbathers waving from shore , out past the rock pilings covered with cormorants into the open water followed by maybe two dozen gulls that soared alongside the ferry for food tossed from passengers . Adrian Littlefield , seated between strangers on the long bench on the top deck , considered his fellow passengers from the isolation he had learned to wrap around himself in public transit . There were couples with children , college students in packs of various sizes , Asian tourists , and pairs of lovers , some obviously married , some obviously not . He watched as they grew more affectionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touching and hugging and holding and even kissing grew more manifest as the mainland grew more distant . This he assigned to the crossing of water , the sense of privacy that passage to an island must add to the sense that all lovers share of being alone against the world and its elements . When the island came into view , he could see the tall sand cliffs , the green headlands , and the litter of sailing boats . From the dock in Old Harbor , Block Island seemed to Adrian like a postcard of the up-market Yankee resort-huge painted Victorian hotels overlooking the harbor with red , white , and blue buntings hanging from their broad verandas , sloops and schooners and power yachts scattered around the seafront , brightly painted shop fronts done up for the season , and an abundance of cedar-shingled housing , graying but not particularly aged . Everywhere there were tanned and happy people in shorts and sandals and designer eyewear going about no particular business . There were bicycles and mopeds and cars for hire . The dockside was busy with day-trippers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were grandparents there to welcome their visiting families and the predictable vignettes of arrival and departure that are all the business of ports of call . Adrian Littlefield waited while the other passengers disembarked . The organizer from the NAFLA group was reminding the attorneys , " Be back for the four o'clock ferry back ! We have the installation of officers ball tonight at Foxwoods ! " This gave the group five hours to tour the island , maybe take a swim , maybe browse the shops for souvenirs . Adrian waited for the rest to leave . He wanted to do his tour alone . He walked up the town , looking over the offerings in store windows , admiring the lithe bodies of women in beachwear , looking into the faces of men . At the top of Main Street , where the road turned sharply left , he came to the National hotel . It looked familiar to him . He climbed the front steps and took a seat on the long porch where lunch was being served . He ordered iced tea and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seafood chowder , crab cakes , and bruschetta . A little taste of everything , he thought . He had a good view of the harbor and the foot traffic coming and going along the Main Street front . There were fathers with cell phones , their teenagers on holidays with their noncustodial parents-subversive daughters being courted by their new stepmothers , young boys bristling at the new men in their mothers " lives . There were young couples traveling en famille , with toddlers and infants and bored preteens . He could see in the faces of the young husbands the fear he had felt in himself at that age , that he 'd be overwhelmed at any minute by the duties and expenses and decisions . He could see in the faces of their wives the worry and regret and second-guessing . How , they seemed to be asking themselves , had they gotten themselves into this predicament ? They had been young and footloose and passionate , and now they were homebound and bored and fatigued by motherhood and family life . They had been creative and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vexed by the daylong needs of their offspring . Adrian tried to reckon the ones who would make it and the ones who would n't . He tried to guess , by something in the way they walked or interacted , which of the children for whom this would be the last real family vacation . In the future there would be other configurations of adults and siblings in their lives . Partners , companions , significant others , spousal equivalents , stepparents , stepsisters , half brothers . But for many this would be the last vacation where mother and father shared the same time of their lives . He was aware of a kind of psychic wince that always registered wrongly as a smile on his face whenever he looked at children and thought of his own children 's pain , courageously borne in the years after their mother left . Of course , there was nothing he could do . Still he suffered a kind of survivors " guilt that what had been the best change in his life and the lightning rod of his success had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hobbled his son and daughter somehow . He had been a good parent and a good provider , but he had not loved their mother . And now , in their young adulthood , he could see in the lives of his son and daughter that essential mistrust of their own hearts , a wariness about the love of others that made it difficult for them to form intimate attachments . He looked for early signals of such things in the manner and conduct of the children passing by . He could see as well the older men eyeing the younger women and felt a quiet kinship with them . Adrian had counted it among the blessings of age that the abundance of women he found attractive was ever broadening even if his sexual prowess began to falter . The older he got , the more younger women there were to look at . Their beauty , at every age , took more of his breath away than it had as a boy . Of course , he no longer " blamed " Clare for her infidelities . Nor could he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were the necessary precipitators of necessary events-an evolution , a natural elaboration of an order whereby the universe of love and attachment purges itself of anomalies . A man of fifty-something-as Adrian was now , as Ben was then-could not easily resist the proffered affections of a woman twenty years his junior . Nor could a woman unhappy in her home life , tired of small towns and small children , bored by her husband 's regular and routine affections , worried over the pressing and passage of time , be expected to travel in the off-season with a handsome artist to a distant island to sail and walk deserted beaches and talk over dinner , idling away the remains of the day , and not offer her body to him . Especially when he had made a fuss over her as a girl . It was only " natural " for a woman at loose ends and a man in his fifties to fall into a fitful consortium should the occasion arise . Adrian Littlefield had himself made a habit of confirming this in the years since , every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the one where he was currently hired to hold forth . Attended as they always were by more than a few of the recently divorced , or the recently traded-in for a younger , fresher model , or the recently disappointed in love or perennially discontented with life , these professional conferences provided cover for those occasions when the sexually rejected might reconfirm their sexiness . Chief among the obligations-Adrian knew this from his own experience-of every newly divorced man and woman was to demonstrate that no sexual dysfunction had occasioned the breakup . As the keynoter and visiting expert at these confabs and conventions , Adrian was often the focus of much of the free-floating , unattached , ready-willing-and-able sexual energy of the registrants , a number of whom , it never failed , would make known in the usual ways to Adrian their availability for more intimate conversations on related themes . He was possessed , after all , of a certain celebrity in these circles . He was famously single , well spoken , well dressed , well paid , and the center of an hour or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspire , entertain , inform , and uplift his listeners . This almost always suited his own purposes . He had no less an appetite for a stranger 's affections than any man or woman . And while he sometimes missed the predictable lovemaking of the married life , he found it hard to count as anything but good fortune that the eighteen years since the dissolution of his marriage had been characterized by more abundant if more distant , more passionate if less precise , hungrier if less often sated , more memorable if often nameless , sexual encounters . If each partner in these arrangements felt equally " used , " it was , all the same , a fellow feeling that seemed to him and to no few of the women he had had sex with , enough . That bodies could pleasure and could be pleasured , free of social , emotional or intellectual encumbrances , seemed to Adrian a good and wholesome thing . And he made it his mission to attend to his partner in ways that would overwhelm whatever residual regret she might otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these women he had maintained an ongoing correspondence , some of which had ended sooner , some later , and some remained pleasant and unpredictable addenda to his professional life . Sometimes he would invite one of them to join him on an extended speaking tour . They would spend a week or maybe two weeks together . They 'd begin to behave like real companions . He 'd remember how she drank her coffee and order room service accordingly . She 'd pack and unpack his things between hotels . They would tell each other secrets over dinner . It warmed something in Adrian he could never quite identify . Getting to know someone after he had gotten to have sex with them was a reversal of the usual arrangement by which the business of intimacy was in the main conducted , but for a variety of reasons , it appealed to him . The flesh , Adrian sometimes pointed out in his workshops , is far less particular than the heart or the mind when it came to finding " suitable " partners . Sex between people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be quite , well , satisfactory , especially on a time-fixed basis . Whereas , he would likewise observe , there were people who could be attracted in every possible way , intimate in all ways in the conduct of their lives together , but sexually uninspired . These were but a few among the many mysteries his programs dealt with . And Adrian had seen in the faces of the registrants at Foxwoods , in the small talk of the NAFLA conferees , in the body language of their pairings and couplings and comminglings at the welcome reception the night before , chitchatting with wines and finger foods , the men in their best business-casual attire , the women wanting to look professional but sexy-he had seen it all-the whole register of human want and willingness and desire . Adrian could see it now , watching from the long porch of the National hotel , the parade of suffering humankind , bearing their various histories and fears of missed chances and discontents along the esplanade , the mercilessly sunlit day unfolding around them : It was inevitable . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his audience , " to quote Professor Bowlby , is told in three volumes : Attachment , Separation , and Loss . " Or if the time allowed only a thumbnail version , " Love , " he 'd say , quoting Roy Orbison , " hurts . " He finished his meal , left a large gratuity , and asked the waitress for a local phone book . In the directory he looked for Ben Walters . There was only one , on Pilot Hill Road . He looked at the map . It was a little ways southwest of town . He went down to the taxi ranks near the boat docks and climbed in an old station wagon with ISLAND HACK &; TAXI TOURS on it . " Tour of the island ? " the old woman at the wheel asked him . " How long does it take ? " he asked . " How long do you have ? " " I have to be back for the four o'clock ferry . " " No problem , " she told him . " That 's acres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Adrian sat in and introduced himself : " Adrian Littlefield . " He extended his hand . " Gloria , Gloria Dodge . You 're welcome to the island . First time here ? " " Yes , well ... yes , my first time . " She drove out of the parking lot and turned northward going out past the hotels , the local bars , the long beaches packed with sunbathers . Adrian kept a map and watched the sights and signposts go by . Gloria kept up the travelogue . " The island is only seven miles long by three miles wide , shaped like a pork chop , less than eleven square miles . " Gloria had this tour spiel memorized . Adrian looked at the unfolded map of the island that he 'd been given by the tour organizers . Block Island did , indeed , look like a pork chop with the narrow , bony end to the north and the squat , round , meaty end to the south . There was a profusion of dune and seascape as they drove out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little rougher water . It was named for the people who did n't want to pay the dime a week to help with the upkeep of the beaches . They could swim there free . " Adrian smiled and nodded and feigned interest . The old station wagon bumped along out what he read was Corn Neck Road past Bush Lot Hill toward Chaqum Pond at the north end of the island . " Many people live here year-round ? " he asked . " I guess they figure around nine hundred now . Most of these homes are seasonals . People from Providence and Hartford and Boston and New York . Many of the same families are coming for generations . I 've been here my entire life . We raised seven children here . Seventeen grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren . They 'll all be coming home next week . My husband 's birthday . " " Wow , " said Adrian , and looked out at the sea . At the end of the road was a rock beach , a small parking lot , and off to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 're making it into a museum . My son is on the volunteer committee . If you want to get out and have a look , I 'll wait . " Adrian shook his head , and she backed the car around to the other side of the road on which they 'd come . " How old wul your husband be ? " " Well , he 'd have been eighty , but he died last year . Still , we figured we 'd get together anyway and celebrate , you know .... It 's all just family . " " That must be very hard , " said Adrian , a little worried that he 'd gotten more information about Gloria than he ever wanted but figuring now there was no turning back . " Well , of course , we all miss him terribly . He was the dearest man , and the grandchildren were so sad , so beautiful .... They wanted to have a cake and get out all the pictures . I ca n't wait to see them . They 're coming from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , everybody 's favorite . He always loved it when they came to visit us here on the island . " " Wo n't that be nice ? " Adrian said . " Look at those beautiful yachts ! " They 'd come to the marina at the Great Salt Pond and the New Harbor area . Sailboats tied to their moorings rocked in the wide basin . Fashionably clad boaters walked up and down the docks . A restaurant called Dead Eye Dicks was doing a brisk luncheon trade . The old wagon passed a small graveyard on the left . " He 's buried in there , " said Gloria . Adrian said nothing , hoping the conversation might take another turn . " Fifty-eight years we were married . But we 'd been " together " for years before that . I met him when I was thirteen . It was February . I was ice-skating with friends and all they could do was laugh at me because I kept falling and I could n't stand up .

" And after he had rescued me , he sat me on a bench on the shore and knelt and untied my skates and helped me on with my boots , and I thought , What a beautiful boy , what a beautiful boy . " " You were very young , " Adrian said . The car turned south on the West Side Road . " Well , it was three years later . I was sixteen . I was walking into town and he stopped his truck and asked if I wanted a lift . And at first I said , " No thanks , " because I did n't want to be too easy , but he just leaned over and said , " Are you sure ? " and I thought , Well ... why not ? I climbed in and we 've been together ever since . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry him .

We had the wedding on New Year 's Eve . It was 1941 . He left for the navy three days later . He was a UDT man . Well , you know , growing up on the island , he knew how to swim . I was nineteen . He was twenty . " Adrian looked at the weathered old woman beside him and tried to imagine her at nineteen . He tried to imagine what it took to marry a man and sleep with a man who was leaving for war and might never return . He wondered if she had been faithful to him . He wondered if he had been faithful to her . He wondered if they discussed such things in those days . " What was his name ? " Adrian asked her . " Bob . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes were red and watering now . There was no sadness in her voice . Only resignation . But her eyes were brimming with real tears . They 'd nearly made it to the southeast corner of the island . Gloria pulled into a parking area below another lighthouse . " Take a walk out there and you 'll be able to see the end of Long Island , " she said , " and Mohegan Bluffs and the Southeast Lighthouse . They had to move the thing back a few years ago . It would have fallen into the sea . And you can say you stood in Rhode Island and saw New York . " Adrian had no interest in the lighthouse or Long Island or a walk in the sand , but he figured Gloria might want a moment to compose herself . So he took the path out among the scrub trees and Rosa rugosa shrubs to where a wooden deck overlooked the high bluffs and the beach below . He stood and looked at the seascape , killing what he figured was enough time for Gloria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car , where she was finishing a cigarette . " Some view , is n't it ! " " Yes , yes it is , spectacular . " They got back into the car ; Gloria started the engine and backed out the drive . The car worked its way north now returning to the town of New Shoreham near the Old Harbor . There were still two hours before the return ferry . " Do you know Pilot Hill Road ? " Adrian asked . " Do you know someone by the name of Ben Walters ? " " There was a Walters up that way , all right . Just above Tug Hole . His wife was sick in some way . I think she died . Summer people from New York . He painted . You know , pictures . I do n't know if he still comes or not . Do you want to go by there ? How do you know them ? " " Friend of the family " Adrian said .

He did n't know what he was supposed to feel or think about it . Ben Walters had only been the first of the infidelities he was sure of . He remembered a time when he hated the name and the idea of another man touching his wife in that way . He 'd tried to outgrow those primitive feelings . He could remember , as a much younger man , wishing for the kind of marriage Gloria had had-those long years , those children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren , that love and grief and routine . Adrian could remember the times as a young family man driving through small towns in Ohio with Clare on a Sunday afternoon , looking into the tall windows of turn-of-the-century homes with their gingerbread and clapboard and backyard gardens , trying to imagine the orderly good-old-days lives of the inhabitants of such places , where everyone had a huge front porch on which they sat in the evening drinking lemonade and telling stories and waving at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how he awoke one morning to find he had the very thing , a settled life in Findlay , Ohio , in an old house with a wide porch and wooden floors and knickknacks and radiators and a wife whose unhappiness seemed to grow in direct proportion to his happiness . He 'd wanted that life : the settled , **29;2504;TOOLONG Rockwell print of an existence where he 'd eventually be the senior pastor of a thriving church where everyone knew everyone and everyone 's business and kept an eye out for each other 's children and were determined to live happily ever after . At about the same time Clare was getting tired of all ofthat . She wanted to know if he 'd consider moving to New York He could maybe manage one of her Uncle Harold 's companies . They could live in Westchester . There would be more money , she was sure . He could commute to the city by train , like Uncle Harold did , to his office in midtown . She could do photography or videos or something artistic , and the kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care center and then to a Montessori school . She could come into the city on Friday nights for the theater ; they could ice-skate at the rink at Rockefeller Center as she had done as a girl visiting Uncle Harold after her mother and father divorced . They would have interesting friends , an interesting life . She was tired of Ohio and Findlay and the Methodist Church . She did n't want to be a senior pastor 's wife . She did n't want a summer place on Lake Erie . She did n't want to grow old in an old house in the Midwest with a man who was going nowhere . He told her he thought there were no geographic cures . " Unhappiness , " he told her , in the way she hated that ministers had of speaking in slogans , " is portable . " Gloria had turned up High Street , and it turned into a dirt road at Pilot Hill . She braked suddenly at the entrance to a small two-track drive on the right . " I think that 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait . Take your time . " Adrian had n't a clue what he was supposed to do or what it was he wanted to find . What if Ben Walters was there and knew who he was ? Maybe Ben 'd read one of his books or seen him on Oprah or heard him on the radio and knew the connections . What if he did n't know Adrian 's connections to the woman he had seduced here almost twenty years ago and how it changed all their lives and left his children motherless and him with his hands full of duty and detail ? What if he was only a withered old man walking around in tennis shorts and sandals with leathery skin and a bald head ? What if he was senile at seventy-something or disabled in some way ? Or what if he was n't ? What would they have to say to each other ? Adrian could feel his heart racing as he worked his way up the little gravel drive to the clearing in the woods where a little cedar-shingled cottage appeared surrounded by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semicircle and badly in need of paint . The place was tiny , a story and a half with a screened porch , inside of which was what looked like the main door . There was no sign of life anywhere around the place . No car , no open windows ; the grass was a little overgrown . He tried the screen door , walked in , then knocked at the main door and listened hard for the sound of any movement inside . There was none . He tried the doorknob , but it was locked . There was nothing . Only the sound of catbirds in the thick woods around the place and the smell of the sea and the movement of the breeze in the greeny things around the place . There was as well the small noise of a wind chime hanging from a hawthorn tree in the yard and , at a distance , the noise of children down the hill near what he guessed was the freshwater pond at the base of the hill . Adrian looked in the window . The interior was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen ; a fieldstone fireplace at one end of the main room ; a small hallway leading to what must be the bedroom or bedrooms-maybe two . There were no signs of recent life inside the house . Adrian walked around to the bedroom window . Through the sheer curtains he could see an old metal bed , a bureau , and a chair . OfF to one side was a sink and a mirror . The bed was made . There was no disorder to the room . He looked out across the yard . There was a small shed with windows and a small porch . It was , he reckoned , the artist 's studio . He looked inside and saw an easel and a table and jars full of brushes and rags hung from hooks on the wall . No canvases or works in progress were anywhere to be seen . Adrian walked back across the yard and sat in one of the Adirondack chairs and propped his elbows on the wide arms . He rested his chin on his folded hands and wondered what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ben Walters would be here in midsummer if he was going to be here at all . The place 's vacancy had about it a permanence that was , to Adrian , palpable . He figured that Ben Walters , now nearing seventy-five , widowed and alone , his little artistic career having come to nothing , must be summering out in assisted living or a nursing home probably after the second or third stroke had left him paralyzed or dumbstruck . Or maybe he 'd lost a leg to diabetes or had bypass surgery or a lung removed . Or maybe he had Alzheimer 's and did n't know one day from the next or his last name or who the President of the United States was . Or maybe he was dead , and the deserted house a portion of his estate that would have to be settled . Anyway , Adrian was sure , he was never going to be making the trip or walking the beach or sweeping anyone else 's wife off her feet , not in this life , and likely not in another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with . It was good that he came here to make this clear . Adrian tried to imagine how it must have been for Clare . Getting her friend Christina to cover for her , getting here , getting it on with the old fart , the romance of it all , the distance from Findlay , Ohio , the hopes for a new , more exciting life . She 'd gotten as far as Cleveland in the years since . She 'd married again and divorced again , and again and again . She seemed , these long years since , every bit as discontented , only older . The children had each spent hours with counselors learning to love their mother without having to approve of her " inappropriate choices , " and to maintain the proper " emotional borders " between themselves and their mother s chaotic life . It occurred to Adrian that if she outlived him , much of his hard-earned estate would work its way to her , through the generosity of his children who would surely use a portion of their inheritance to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as ever , in need . Oh well " is what he told himself when such things came to him . There was nothing about this place , his coming here , that had the sense of portent he had imagined when he first made arrangements to travel here . He had simply married the wrong woman . He had chosen wrongly . He had mistaken good sex , hardly a difficult thing at twenty-something , for true affection . He knew it early in the marriage . He remembered the mornings he would awake beside her , knowing that there was nothing about her that he really treasured , really admired , really needed . She was not , he knew , a great mother , an exceptional human , or a particularly good woman . They had had good sex , made good babies , not brought out the worst in each other . But neither had they brought out the best . And he had been , stupidly , willing to live with the consequences of his poor decisions , to tolerate waking next to a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an ordinary life free of the larger vexations . He had not , in his marriage to her , abused her physically or verbally . He had tried his very best to make her happy . He had n't drunk or gambled or cavorted with other women . He 'd done his share of diapers and dishes . He had tried to support her efforts to find more interesting things to " do " than " wife and mothering . " He had been , in all ways he thought , the reliable husband , the hedged bet against hunger and loneliness , the other body in the bed . He had not , he knew it now , ever loved her entirely . Sitting in the Adirondack chair on Ben Walters 's deserted front lawn , Adrian wondered if she 'd ever known how much he really did n't love her . Maybe something in her sensed that emptiness and railed against his willingness to live in a loveless if otherwise functional marriage . Maybe it was this that drove her to do what she had done . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , enough would never be enough . Which aberration of desire , he now wondered , offended God or Nature or the Fates the most ? He walked back to the car where Gloria was just finishing a cigarette . She pressed it out in the ashtray and started the engine . " Anyone home ? " " No one , nothing there . " " Too bad , " she said , " you 've come all this way . " Oh well , " Adrian said , " another time maybe . " She backed out to Pilot Hill Road and drove Adrian back to the ferry docks . He gave her a fifty-dollar bill and thanked her for the tour . " But it 's only thirty dollars . " " Buy a little cheer for the birthday party . " " That 's really good of you , " Gloria said , folding the crisp note into her shirt pocket . " May I ask you , " Adrian said , leaning back with one foot out of the car , " may I ask you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever , in those fifty-eight years you were married to Bob , did you ever wonder , " What the hell am I doing here ? ' - you know , with the kids and the work and the routine ? " " No , " she said without hesitation , " never once . I was just so glad to have him home , safe , after the war . I 'd missed him so . And I thought , I always thought , what a beautiful man , what a good man he was . So I can tell you , we had our hard days , sure . But no , I never wondered about being with him . I wish I were with him now . I can still feel him . " There was a catch in her breath . Her hands dropped from the steering wheel of the old wagon . Adrian said nothing . " The young these days are so unhappy , so impatient , so full of expectations . All we wanted was to survive it . To be together . To get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the children . Nowadays they just want too much . Whatever they have , they think there must be more . They want so much they do n't know what they want . " She was staring at a point in the middle of the steering wheel . She caught her breath again . " Yes , yes , I suppose that 's it . " Adrian wondered what it was he wanted . He had long since lost hope of a woman who could love him as a wife would and love his children as a mother . That mix of passion and sacrifice seemed quite impossible to him now , not because such women did not exist , but because he lacked what it was they wanted . Though he had housekeepers and nannies and tutors and teachers and therapists for his children ; though he could find a woman any night of the week to pleasure and who would pleasure him ; there had not been nor would there be , he now knew with certainty , anyone like Gloria in his life-a woman who would mourn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was , the old man he hoped to be ; who would love him and outlive him and keep him alive in the daily lives and times of his people , his children and his children 's children . He could feel the wave of sadness rising in him that he knew , if he did not move , would overtake him . He closed the car door and made for the ferry . " Safe home ! " she shouted after him . Boarding the boat , Adrian blew kisses . Author Affiliation THOMAS LYNCH has published three collections of essays , including Booking Passage : We Irish and Americans ( 2005 ) .
