Chapter One " You were the chief investigator at the scene of the accident ? " Seated at the defense table , Jackie Flowers kept her voice low . Courtroom 12 was as tight as a shoe box and the jurors were so close they could have heard Assistant District Attorney Tom Tuttle break wind . " Objection ! " Tuttle sprang to his feet and two jurors winced . " This is a manslaughter case , " Tuttle said , oblivious to the judge 's pained expression as his words echoed in the airless room . The walnut slats covering the wall behind the bench made Jackie feel as if she were trapped inside a pipe organ . " ' Accident ' is hardly appropriate in view of the fact that Ms. Flowers ' client decapitated - " " My client has already sworn under oath , and he intends to repeat that testimony in this court " - gracefully rising , Jackie caught the same two jurors , now joined by a third , gazing at her client with renewed interest - " that he secured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chains . It came unhitched and sailed across the median into oncoming traffic . That sounds like an accident to me . " " Overruled , " the judge said . " If this were a murder case , Mr. Tuttle , you would n't be assigned to it . " Jackie strode to center stage . Accident . Focus the jury on the accident , not her client . Or , God forbid , the victim . In her cobalt suit and two-inch alligator heels she stood eye to eye with the seated witness . Positioning herself directly between him and the jury box , she hooked a honey blonde curl behind her ear and softly continued . " What was the condition of the road ? " " Irregular . " " Help us out , Officer . Do n't you mean washboard ? " " I guess . " " And you were able to ascertain the exact section of that washboard asphalt where my client 's trailer came unhitched ? " Damned if he did , damned if he did n't . Admit Jackie 's client @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know where to look for that wire and bolt ? The biggest mistake most cops made was getting in a pissing match with the lawyer instead of focusing on the jury . The witness looked helplessly at the DA and Jackie smiled . With every eye in the courtroom on her , she could afford to be generous . " You told this jury your job was to examine the highway for evidence that the hitch was or was n't bolted . What precisely were you looking for ? " " Metal bolt and piece of wire . " Sweat prickled his upper lip . " What did you find ? " " Bottles , cans , rubber . You name it . " The officer gave a weak laugh and tried to look past Jackie at the jury . " Some people think I-25 's their personal dump site . " " How high are the weeds at the side of the road ? Eighteen inches ? " " Thereabouts . " " So you used a metal detector . " " Well , no . " She took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Beg pardon ? " Now she was leaning over the witness stand . " When you got down on your hands and knees on the shoulder of I-25 and dug through all those weeds and trash looking for a three-inch scrap of wire and a sheared-off steel bolt ! " " I - " " No further questions , Your Honor . " Tuttle and his two assistants fled through the door behind the bench as soon as the gavel dropped . Jackie watched her client being manacled and led off by a deputy laden with chains , pepper spray , stun gun - enough junk to stock a militiaman 's RadioShack . Until he hit that pothole , he 'd been just another carpenter on his way to work . Albeit one with two previous DUIs to his credit . Shaking her head , she took her time packing her briefcase with the blank legal pads and unopened Rules of Criminal Procedure that were her stock-in-trade . When the courtroom finally cleared she left . On this first Monday in April , the fourth-floor corridor of Denver 's City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bleating walkie-talkies and screeching cell phones . The marble pillars and terrazzo floors made the clattering heels of hookers and their higher-priced attorneys audible from the far end of the hall , and a tide of shackled prisoners whose color-coded scrubs denoted their presumed level of culpability streamed from the sheriff 's private elevator . Jackie stood aside for a trio of women in washed-out olive and pea-green jumpsuits destined for drug court . " We 'll knock it down from manslaughter to neg homicide . " It had taken ADA Tom Tuttle eight minutes to recognize his case was going down after his chief witness bailed out . Record time . " The only negligence is your office going to trial with this case . " " Come on , Jackie . " He was trying not to beg . " What choice did we have ? Sixteen-year-old honor student driving down I-25 in a brand-new Mustang , minding his own business - " " That cop never even looked for a bolt , and you know it . " " Your client 's been busted twice for drunk driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The most we 'll consider is careless . " " Careless driving ? " A felon shuffling by in leg irons and Day-Glo orange turned to look , and Tuttle lowered his voice . " Duncan Pratt 's not going to like that . " Since when did the Denver district attorney have to bless every plea ? " He 'll like it more than an acquittal . When my guy takes the stand tomorrow all bets are off . " Tired of waiting for the public elevator , Jackie started for the stairs . " Hear about that six-year-old boy who 's been reported missing out by the country club ? " Tuttle was at her elbow . The marble staircase behind the elevator bank conferred an unwanted intimacy and she quickened her pace . " Another missing kid , right up your alley . " " Missing kid ? " " Did n't you defend that sleazebag accused in one case last year ? " Why did every DA take his brethren 's defeats so personally ? " My client walked , " she said . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six-year-old boy . " " Maybe you 'll be lucky enough to defend another innocent client . " " Keep filing on the wrong guys , and what do you expect ? " She began counting the steps to the lobby . " So you 've already made a bust ? " " He 's only been missing since yesterday . " Not even long enough to file a missing person 's report . DAs were all alike ; they took it personally and they saw a pervert behind every bush . " Maybe he ran away . " Tuttle 's smile pitied her . " How far can a six-year-old run ? " Jackie stepped through the City and County Building 's majestic doors and into the sunlight . Standing with her adversary beneath the fifty-foot columns , she gazed down at beds of purple and yellow pansies whose festivity mocked the grim business within . Across Civic Center , the gold dome of the state capitol gleamed but clouds were massing to the north . " You know how easy it is to lure a kid , " Tuttle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it takes is something bright and shiny . " A little girl in a frilly dress . A man in a dark sedan easing to the curb and leaning out the window . A handsome man , with a snap-brim hat and an easy smile - Blinking away the memory of the public safety film shown so many years ago to her grade school class , Jackie started down the granite steps . Since when did evil wear a snap-brim hat ? ( Continues ... )
