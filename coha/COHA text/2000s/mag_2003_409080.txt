Dear Dr. Cory : My grandpa passed away and I 'm feeling blue . Do you have any suggestions toward making me feel better ? Amber Zitzloff Monticello , Minnesota Dear Amber : It is very normal for you to be feeling blue . The best thing you can do is to keep talking about your feelings with your mom or dad and other family members . In fact , you will be helping them by letting them talk about their feelings as well . Not only can you talk about your sad feelings , but you can also talk about the good times with your grandpa . You will probably find yourself laughing about some of those times . Laughter can be a nice relief and important in the healing process . Eventually the hurt does get less , but the happy memories will always be with you . // I am glad that you are able to discuss the fact that you are feeling sad . Feelings that are hidden usually come out later and maybe not in such a healthy way . Dear Dr. Cory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period yet . My friend has and so have some other girls . Is it normal that I have not started yet ? Name withheld Troy , Michigan Dear Reader : Yes , it is normal . Menstrual periods usually begin about two years after the start of puberty , often just before the age of thirteen , but some before then and some after . Once the menstruation cycle begins , periods will probably be irregular until the body adjusts to all the changes going on . It is a good idea to keep track of your menstrual cycle on the calendar in case any questions or concerns come up . Later in life , physicians who take your medical history may ask at what age you began menstruation . It is good to keep this kind of information in a safe place with your medical records . Photograph // Dear Dr. Cory : I am nine years old and I have asthma . I have to do a lot of running , and I run out of breath easily . How can I control it ? Kiriabeth Crespo Tampa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wheezing , coughing , chest tightness , or even chest pain during or after exercise . Sports that involve running or any intense activity for long periods of time ( such as soccer , basketball , or hockey ) can cause more problems than sports using short bursts of energy ( such as baseball , football , short-distance track events , golfing , or gymnastics ) . Asthmatic symptoms can be worsened in cold , dry air , so some people with asthma can better tolerate sports performed in warm , moist air ( such as swimming ) . People with asthma brought on by activity can still exercise . They just learn to control their asthma with medication and find the sport that works best for them . Many athletes with exercise-induced asthma have excelled-even winning Olympic gold medals ! Dear Dr. Cory : I am thirteen years old and I have a question : What is the best way to get rid of acne besides getting a medical treatment or buying acne products ? Silvia Gonzales , California Dear Silvia : Try gently cleansing your face every morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Harsh , frequent scrubbing will irritate your skin , making the acne worse . Take good care of your skin by eating a well-balanced diet , getting eight to ten hours of sleep , drinking lots of water , and being physically active for at least an hour each day . If possible , avoid wearing make-up and skin creams . If you feel you need to use these products , use only oil-free , waterbased or non-comedogenic products . // You can also try an over-the-counter acne medicine such as benzoyl peroxide . Follow the instructions carefully . If your condition does not improve , then your doctor may want to prescribe a stronger medication such as tretinoin ( Retin-A ) or antibiotics . Caring for acne requires careful supervision from your doctor . Improvement may seem slow at first , since low doses of prescriptive medicine are used to avoid irritation . But results are often seen within three to four weeks . Pills and lotions made from " natural " ingredients ( alternative medicines ) are not regulated by such agencies as the Food and Drug Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of scientific testing that is required of over-the-counter or prescribed medicines . Therefore , little is known about how well they work or their side effects , such as how an ingredient might affect a certain type of allergy . See you next issue !
