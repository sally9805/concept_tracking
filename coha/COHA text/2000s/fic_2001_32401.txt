Three Months Later Minus 3 Days Jason brought the open-topped Peace Corps Jeep to a stop and turned off its ignition . The engine coughed once and died . He hauled himself up by the roll bar and studied the browned valley ahead . The Ethiopian Orthodox monastery known to locals as Debra Damarro loomed against the rolling hills , a square fortress hewn from solid rock . Why the ancients had built here , in such a remote corner of Tigre in northern Ethiopia , so far from the beaten track of worshipers , was beyond him , but then so was the tenor of Orthodoxy in general . And Christianity , for that matter . Acacia trees swayed in the courtyard , serene in the afternoon heat . Jason kept his eyes fixed on the iron gate where Daal insisted he would be met and speedily serviced . The Eritrean invasion was only three days old , but already the Eritrean Peoples Liberation Front ( EPLF ) had brought the border dispute as far south as Axum to the west ; it was a wonder they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't taking the sudden invasion along its northern border lying down . They were obviously keeping the enemy forces occupied elsewhere , where more than a single remote monastery was at stake . It was not the first time Eritrea had made this absurd claim to the land beyond its drawn borders . Absurd because even the pagans knew that Orthodox Ethiopians would defend their northern holy sites to the death . The queen of Sheba had first brought Solomons wisdom and , according to many , his child , here to her castle near Axum , fifty miles to the southwest . The Jewish religionhad swept through the hills , and several hundred years later , the Ark of the Covenant had followedalso to Axum , the priests insisted . A growing contingent of scholars at least agreed with the Ethiopian orthodox community that the Arks last known resting place was indeed somewhere in northern Ethiopia . Christianity had first come to Africa here , along this northern border . And now for the second time in ten years , Eritrea was openly disputing that border . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Absurd . Most of the relief workers in the surrounding towns had already fled south to the country 's capital , Addis Ababa , with the first evacuation order . Most . But not Jason Marker . Daal , his Irob interpreter , had begged him for this one favor . To deliver this one orphan stranded at this remote monastery to safety . And why would he risk his life to save a single child in a land where a hundred thousand would die in the next famine ? Why would he head north , closer to the EPLF forces , instead of blazing a trail south as demanded by the Corps ? Perhaps because he was in the Corps : the kind of man who at least on occasion threw caution to the wind for a sense of greater purpose . Or maybe to appease the guilt he felt at having decided to leave Ethiopia for good . But most likely because he was n't really risking his life at all . The Eritreans would probably not harm an American . Daal had sworn nothing less before running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would engage in this one last humanitarian mission and close this chapter in his life . And just as wellworking in Ethiopia had been like trying to extract water from a bag of flour . Jason wiped the rolling sweat from his forehead , rubbed his hand on his khakis , and dropped back into the seat . The monastery seemed quiet enough . He reached for the key , and the faint rumble of an engine drifted through the air . His hand froze . It was n't the Jeep 's engine , of course . He had n't turned the key . Jason scanned the horizon quickly . The road ran past the monastery and climbed the hills to the right , disappearing into valleys and reappearing on the distant hills beyond like a tan snake . He saw the trucks then , tiny dots slinking into a valley several miles off . A small grunt escaped his throat , and for a terrible moment he could n't think . He snatched up his binoculars and peered at the trucks . EPLF ! It was an EPLF column , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . Which meant what ? That Daal had been wrong ? Jason 's doctorate was in agriculture , not military maneuvers , but he hardly needed an education to tell him that this was not good . His heart was doing the job splendidly . He spun around in a panic and grabbed for the old bolt action .30-06 he used for the occasional hunt . His sweaty palm slapped at the worn wood stalk and managed to claw it off the back seat before sending it clattering to the floorboards behind . What was he thinking ? Take on the Eritrean army with a thirty-ought-six ? Jason fired the Jeep 's engine , shoved the stick forward , and dropped the clutch . The old World War II vehicle jerked forward . He tore for the gate , blinking against the simple thought that he was headed the wrong way . He should be leaving . It was n't terribly clear why he did continue for that closed iron gate . At any moment his arms would yank the steering wheel and whip the Jeep through a one-eighty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran for the gate and threw it open . Jason roared through and braked the Jeep into a skidding stop , three meters from the monastery 's foundation . Wide , sweeping steps cut from sandstone rose to an arching entry . Heavy wooden doors gaped open to a dark interior . Behind him the gatekeeper was yelling in Amharic . Jason slid from the seat and bounded up the steps two at a time . He ran through an internal circuit and into the cavernous sanctuary . He slid to a stop on the polished stone floor . To say that the room was empty would have misstated the matter . Although Jason was indeed alone in the huge domed sanctum , an imposing silence filled the space , heavy enough to resonate through his skull with a distant ring . His blood pounded through his ears . High above him a yellow face covering half the dome peered down unblinking , engaging his eyes . Sire ! Jason spun . The voice echoed across the sanctuary . " Sire , you are not permitted in this room . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you have a Father Matthew here ? I have to see him ! " The white-draped priest stared at Jason as if he 'd just swallowed a small boulder . He held an ancient text in his arms , a huge book browned by time . Jason lowered his voice . " Please , man . Forgive me , but I have to see Father Matthew immediately . Do you know that there are soldiers " " It 's quite all right , Phillip . " Jason turned to the new voice . An old priest wearing the same traditional white garb as the other priest shuffled with small steps from a doorway on his left . " Come , come , come . " He motioned for Jason to follow . " Father Matthew ? " " Yes , of course . And you are the good man Daal promised , yes ? Then come , come . " The priest pulled at a wiry white beard that hung a good foot off his chin . He smiled and his large oblong eyes flashed knowingly , as if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part that he was now executing perfectly . Jason glanced at the first priest , who had bowed his head to Father Matthew . " We do n't have all day , young man . You have come for the boy , yes ? " Jason faced Father Matthew . " Yes . " He headed for the old man , who nodded and shuffled hurriedly from the room . They walked into a passageway cut from the same sandstone as the monastery 's exterior . The whole structure was literally one large rock , carved and chipped away over many years , not so unusual in northern Ethiopia . Jason hurried after the priest , who moved very quickly considering his small steps . They descended a flight of steps by the light of a torch 's flickering flame and then followed a tunnel farther into the earth . He 'd never been so deep in a monastery . Stories of the secret underground caverns were common , but Jason had never suspected they were much more than small enclaves . Certainly not serviced by the well-worn passageways he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith , " the old man said with a hint of sarcasm . " Amazing . " " And it makes us priests feel rather special , crawling through the earth like moles while the flock wanders above . " This was no ordinary priest . A tad eccentric from his years below the surface perhaps . " The mortals above are carrying guns now , " Jason said . " You do realize that , Father . The EPLF is less than five minutes up the road . " " Precisely . Which is why we are hurrying . You think I walk with such haste every waking hour ? " " You knew they 'd be coming ? That 's not what Daal told me . He said this would be a simple in-and-out trip to collect the orphan and take him to safety . Somehow it is n't feeling quite so simple . " " Ah , Daal . He was always a bit smooth with the tongue . Rather like a lot of priests I know . It 's a case of humanity , I suspect ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but made clearer with insistence . " He shuffled on and held up a finger , half turning . " What you can not establish with wit you can always further with a little volume , do n't you think ? " Ordinarily Jason would have chuckled at the old man 's own wit , but the image of those trucks plowing over the hills outside tempered his humor . The priest was muttering now , and his echoes sounded like a chuckle through the tunnel . They hurried deeper into the earth . " Maybe you could just bring the child out to the Jeep , " Jason said . He was having a hard time communicating his urgency to the old senile goat . " Maybe I should go back and " " Do you believe in God ? " They broke into a torch-lit room furnished with a single wooden table and two chairs . The priest turned to face him . His long eyes sagged in the surreal orange light . " Do I ... yes , of course " " Or do you just say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt in your eyes , young man . " Jason blinked , stunned . Father Matthew was clearly out of touch . Outside a war was looming and he wasted time philosophizing about God in the bowels of some lost monastery . The old man spoke hurriedly now . " Do you believe that Jesus Christ was a madman ? " " What ? " " Do you believe that when he announced that his disciples would do greater things than he had , he was delusional ? " " What does this have to do with anything ? We have to get out , man ! " " I thought not , " the priest said . " You do not believe . And yes , we are short on time . But our lives are in God 's hands . " " That 's fine , but if you would n't mind I would like to get out of here before the bullets start flying . I 'm not sure your God is quite so attentive to my interests . " " Yes , I can see that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me here in the first place , if you 're so confident that God will save you ? " " You are here , are n't you ? I will assume that he sent you . So then he is saving us . Or at least the child . Unless we are too late , of course . " Jason shoved the logic from his mind and tried to control his frustration . " Then please help your God along and get me the kid . " The priest studied Jason 's face . " I want your word . You will die before allowing Caleb to come to harm . " Jason balked at the man 's audacity . " Swear it . " It was an insane moment and he spoke quickly , to appease the man . " Of course , I promise you . Now get him please . " " We found him at the gate when he was a baby , you know . Abandoned here by a retreating Eritrean commander who had just killed his mother during the last war . She was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy seeking absolution for his sins . " Father Matthew stared unblinking , as if the revelation should explain some things . But the tale sounded rather par for the course in this mad place . " The boy is no ordinary child . I think you will see that soon enough . Did you know that he has never seen beyond the gate ? You will only be the fourth man he has ever laid eyes on in his ten years of life . He has never seen a woman . " " He 's been in this monastery his whole life ? " " I raised him as a son . Where I go he goes . Or in this case where I stay , he has stayed . Except now . Now God has sent you to deliver the boy and I am bound by a vow to remain here . " He reached inside his tunic and withdrew an envelope . He handed the brown packet out to Jason , who looked unsure . " These are his papers , granting him refugee status outside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impression that I was taking him to Addis Ababa . " " As long as he is in this country , his life is in danger . You must deliver him to safety beyond our borders . " Jason was about to tell the old man that he was losing true north when a door suddenly burst open to their right . A boy ran into the room , grinning from ear to ear . " Dadda ! " He spoke in Amharic , but he did n't look Ethiopian . His skin was a creamy tan and his dark hair hung in loose curls to his shouldershe was clearly of mixed race . A simple cotton tunic similar to the priest 's covered his small frame . The boy ran up and threw his arms around the priest 's waist , burying his face in the man 's tunic . Father Matthew palmed the envelope , smiled , and dropped to his knees to hug the child . " Hello , Caleb . " He kissed him on his forehead and looked into the boy 's eyeseyes as brilliant blue-green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time has come , my son . " He smoothed the boy 's hair lovingly . Caleb faced Jason with those large , round , eyes . The priest had prepared the boy already , and Jason wondered what the boy knew . A tremor shook the ground and Jason instinctively glanced up . It was a shell ! A shell had detonated outside ! Father Matthew 's hand grabbed Jason 's and pressed the envelope into his palm . The old man 's eyes were misted by the flame 's light . " Promise me , my friend , I beg you ! Take him beyond our borders . " " I will . I will . Get us out of here ! " The priest 's eyes lingered for a brief moment , searching for truth . He whirled for the boy , who stared at the ceiling as another rumble shook the room . He snatched Caleb 's hand . " Follow me ! Run ! " The small shuffle steps Father Matthew had employed to lead Jason down gave way to long strides , and Jason raced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an enigma but certainly no idiot . His voice called back as they ran . " They are firing on the village behind the monastery . We still have time . I have asked the others to distract them if necessary . " " Distract ? " " We have a moat behind for water . It will be burning with oil . " The child ran silently , on the heels of his father . They burst into the same sanctuary Jason had been scolded for entering earlier . Now another figure stood at its center , spinning around to face them as they rushed in . She wore a navy blue tunic not unlike you might see on any street corner throughout Ethiopia , but the woman was clearly not Ethiopian . A hood shrouded a deeply tanned face . She seemed to arrest even the old priest 's attention for a moment . " Oh yes , I 'd nearly forgotten about you , dear , " Father Matthew said . He turned to Jason . " This is the nurse Leiah . She came to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp in Eritrea that was overrun . " " A woman , " Jason said , not because the discovery was notable , but because everyone knew women were strictly prohibited past the gates of any Ethiopian Orthodox monastery . Yet here was most definitely a woman . A Frenchwoman . The woman glanced at the door leading to the courtyard and then back to Jason . She approached him quickly . " Take me with you ! " she said in perfect English . She turned to Father Matthew . " Father , tell him he must take me with him ! " Her blue eyes begged . She grabbed his shirt and tugged gently toward the door . " Hurry ! We have to leave . " A loud detonation shook the sanctuary and Jason ducked with the sound . " Take her , " the priest said . He knelt and took Caleb in his arms again . He drew the boy close and whispered in his ear . When he pulled back , tears snaked from his eyes , wetting each cheek . " Remember what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Listen to your heart ; the eyes will deceive . Remember . " He spoke in Amharic . " Let 's go ! Hurry , " Jason urged them . For all the talk of delivering these to safety , they would n't make it past the front gate if they did n't leave now . Assuming the gate was not already overtaken . " Dadda ... " the boy said . " Go with God , Caleb . His love is better than life . " " Dadda ... " Jason grabbed the boy 's arm and tugged him toward the arching entry . Leiah , the woman , was already at the door craning for a view on either side . She spun to them . " Hurry , hurry ! " " Jason , " the priest said . " What 's soft and round and says more than it should ? " Jason spun back . " Wha ? " " The hem of a tunic . " Father Matthew smiled . " An old Ethiopian riddle about modesty that will make sense to you one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran from the monastery together , Leiah in the lead , with Jason and the boy following behind . The midday sun blinded Jason for an instant . He released the boy 's hand and took the steps more by feel than by sight . Behind him Father Matthew 's voice urged a faltering boy . " Go ! Run . Run to the truck and climb in . It will be all right . Remember my riddle , Jason . " There was no sign of soldiers on this side of the monastery , but the detonations of what Jason assumed to be mortar fire shook the ground behind them . Black smoke boiled into the sky . Father Matthew 's burning moat . Oil . Jason spun to see the boy picking his way down the broad steps on his tiptoes . His round eyes glanced around , petrified . Jason bounded up the steps , grabbed the boy around the waist , and ran for the Jeep . " Give him to me ! " the nurse demanded , her arms outstretched from the back seat . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set him on the seat beside her . The boy immediately covered his eyes with his hands and buried his head in her lap . " Get us out of here ! Hurry , man ! " Leiah said . " I am . I am ! Hold on ! " The engine roared to life with the first turn of the ignition . Jason rammed the shift stick forward and floored the accelerator . The Jeep spun in a circle , raising dust on all sides . He angled the vehicle for the gate and grabbed another gear . Behind them an explosion shook the courtyard . They were lobbing the explosives to the front ! Ahead the gate was closed . The gatekeeper ran out , pointing frantically to Jason 's rear . He glanced back and saw the first truck emerging from a cloud of smoke beside the monasterya Land Rover painted in desert camouflage . Jason did n't let up on the gas pedal . He had the engine wound out in third gear , screaming for the closed gate . " Open it ! Open the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . The gatekeeper flew for the latch , like a ghost in his flowing white robes . He shoved the gates open and ran for the monastery , uttering sharp cries barely heard above the thumping explosions behind them . The Jeep struck one of the gates with a clang and shot out onto the driveway . Jason shoved the gearbox into high gear , veered off the road in his haste , corrected with a jerk of the wheel , and centered the vehicle on the road leading from the valley . " Stay on the road ! Watch the potholes ! " Her warning came too late and their right wheel pounded through a hole the size of a Volkswagen . Jason cleared the seat a good foot before crashing back down . He glanced back to see Leiah 's white face . The boy was still buried in her lap , oblivious to the world . " Watch for the holes ! " Leiah yelled . " I am ! " Behind them a huge explosion ripped through the air , like a thunderclap rumbling across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chest , loud in his ears , spurred by a mixture of terror and euphoria . Machine guns stuttered in long bursts . This was no abstract attack on a village . They were destroying the monastery wholesale , an unspoken taboo , even during an invasion . The monasteries had survived a thousand years precisely because of the reverence they commanded . Slaughter of women and children was far more common in this land than the destruction of a shrine . They had nearly reached the crest of the first hill when Jason looked back again . What he saw ran through his chest like a spike on the end of a sledgehammer . He caught his breath . The monastery was without ambiguity history , crumbled and smoking , a remnant of its former structure . No soul could possibly have lived through such a pounding . And if one or two did manage to find the sunlight alive , a ring of trucks with mounted machine guns awaited to make certain they did not savor it too long . Jason saw the destruction in a glance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight that nearly drove him from the road . It was the sight of a lone truck barreling down the road behind them . Leiah must have seen the look on his face , because she spun to face the valley . Machine-gun fire cut through the air , a small popping sound , like popcorn in a microwave . " Move it ! They 're catching us ! " she screamed . Something snapped in Jason 's mind . The euphoria of their escape was smothered by horror . They were being pursued . " Faster ! Drive faster ! " " Shut up ! I 'm driving as fast as I can ! Just shut up and let me drive ! " They crested the hill and roared into the next valley . For a few seconds , maybe ten , they were alone with the growling of their own engine . And then the larger Land Rover broke over the hill and screamed after them . Jason felt panic wash over his spine . They were going to die . He knew that with dread certainty .
