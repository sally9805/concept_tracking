HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES AND E-WASTE MANAGEMENT IN THE EUROPEAN UNION <p> As a result of expanding international production and trade , a consumer in Berlin , Boston , Beijing , or Bangalore can choose between many similar manufactured goods in her local store . For example , she can purchase a cell phone , laptop , freezer , stove , or vacuum cleaner made by a large multinational company that is a household name around the world . Similarly , environmental activists in San Francisco , Shanghai , Surat , and Stockholm might share a growing concern about the ecological and human health risks posed by discarded electronic and electrical products  --  so-called e-waste . In fact , societies around the world are struggling with growing levels of e-waste , which contains myriad hazardous substances that present significant environmental and human health problems. 1 <p> The European Union ( EU ) has emerged as a global leader on hazardous substances policy. 2 While such policy has been a cornerstone of EU environmental policy since the 1960s , the EU has recently developed a series of new policy initiatives to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substances . These new policies govern the use , recycling , and disposal of hazardous substances in electronic and electrical products and expand regulations on the production , use , and sales of tens of thousands of chemicals . While these policies regulate the management of hazardous substances and e-waste across 27 European countries , EU policy also increasingly shapes decisions by policymakers , manufacturers , and consumers around the world . <p> Three recent EU policy developments  --  two " directives " and one " regulation , " in EU terms  --  are of particular significance to the future management of hazardous chemicals and e-waste. 3 The first directive covers waste electrical and electronic equipment ( WEEE ) , 4 and the second outlines restrictions on the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment ( RoHS ) . 5 WEEE and RoHS entered into force in February 2003 . Finally the regulation on the registration , evaluation , and authorization of chemicals ( REACH ) will soon be finalized and will become legally binding in 2007 . <p> WEEE , RoHS , and REACH are noteworthy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts . Furthermore , aspects of the new hazardous substances and e-waste standards are the highest in the world . As such , they are drawing considerable attention from policymakers , regulators , company managers , and environmental activists from around the globe . Because of growing international trade and the diffusion of policy ideas and information , producers and users of chemicals , heavy metals , and manufactured goods in markets such as the United States , Japan , and China will be affected by EU policy . In effect , new , higher EU regulatory and product standards are likely to push many global standards upward through a process that political scientist David Vogel calls " trading up . " 6 EU Politics , Hazardous Substances , and E-Waste <p> Over the past decade , the EU has grown dramatically in terms of its national membership , market and population size , and environmental policy ambitions. 7 As of 1 January , 2007 , the EU consists of 27 member countries  --  up from 12 countries in 1994 ( see Figure 1 ) . Three more countries ( Croatia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged in membership negotiations , and several others have expressed a desire to join in the future . At 27 members , the EU population is approximately 485 million ; roughly one in 14 people in the world live in the EU. 8 The size of the EU economy  --  roughly $11 trillion  --  is similar to that of the United States ( population 300 million ) . <p> Parallel to the EU 's growing size , EU legal and political authority has also been greatly expanded through the adoption of a series of European treaties since the late 1980s . This expansion of EU policymaking competence includes most environmental policy issues , where European environmental policies are now among the most harmonized areas of member state policy. 9 As the EU 's geographical scope and legal authority have expanded , the EU has become a central driving force on European hazardous substances and waste management and , in some respects , a regional and global leader in sustainable development initiatives . The chart below summarizes the current EU environmental policymaking process . <p> EU officials periodically adopt broad strategies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Linked to its 2001 Sustainable Development Strategy , the EU set the goal to " by 2020 , ensure that chemicals are only produced and used in ways that do not pose significant threats to human health and the environment . " 10 This is almost identical to the 2020 goal adopted on an EU initiative at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002. 11 In addition , EU integrated product policy aims to reduce resource use and the environmental impact of waste. 12 The EU Sixth Environment Action Programme ( 20022012 ) also outlines priorities for chemical management , including generating more scientific data , accelerating risk management , and making substitutions for hazardous chemicals . " Natural resources and waste " is one of the Environment Action Programme 's four priority areas , focusing on the need to reduce waste volumes and improve recycling . <p> The Sustainable Development Strategy and the Sixth Environment Action Programme reconfirm the EU commitment to the precautionary principle in reference to hazardous substances  --  a commitment included in the 1992 Treaty on European Union . An oft-cited definition of the precautionary principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irreversible damage , lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation . " 13 More recently , the European Commission has argued that the precautionary principle should be taken into consideration across environmental and human health issues. 14 This somewhat broader application has been supported by the European Court of Justice. 15 WEEE and RoHS <p> E-waste is a rapidly growing problem in the EU . The waste electric and electronic equipment ( WEEE ) and restriction of hazardous substances ( RoHS ) directives are intended to tackle this problem by addressing hazardous substances in electronic and electrical products and waste streams . WEEE is designed to increase European recovery and recycling of electrical and electronic equipment , thereby reducing the quantity of e-waste going to final disposal . Through the concept of extended producer responsibility , consumers can return all regulated electrical and electronic equipment ( free of charge ) to the producers , who are responsible for recycling , reprocessing , and safely disposing of the equipment and its components . Thus , WEEE provides incentives to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly ways and to take future waste management requirements into account as they design new products . <p> The WEEE directive regulates ten different product categories ( listed in Annex 1A of the directive ) : large household appliances ; small household appliances ; information technology and telecommunications equipment ; consumer equipment ; lighting equipment ; electrical and electronic tools ; toys , leisure , and sports equipment ; medical devices ; monitoring and control instruments ; and automatic dispensers . In addition , the directive includes long lists of regulated individual products under each of the 10 product categories ( found in Annex 1B of the directive ) . Each EU member state is required to design a national implementation system . Furthermore , EU legislation , consistent with policy developments under the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal , prohibits member states from exporting hazardous wastes to developing countries to rid Europe of such problems . <p> As a critical supplement to the WEEE directive , the RoHS directive strictly limits the use of 6 toxic substances in 8 of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Table 1 ) . However , the two WEEE-regulated product categories that are not initially covered by RoHS  --  medical devices and monitoring and control instruments  --  may be added later . The Rolls directive currently covers four heavy metals ( lead , mercury , cadmium , and hexavalent chromium ( Cr-VI ) ) and two chemicals , polybrominated biphenyls ( PBB ) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDE ) , all of which are common in electrical and electronic goods . Maximum allowed concentrations of each substance are 0.1 percent by weight with the exception of cadmium , which is limited to 0.01 percent by weight . <p> Concentration limits set under the RoHS directive are by weight of homogeneous material , which means a material that can not be mechanically disjointed into different materials . In the context of the RoHS directive , mechanically disjointed is defined as separated by mechanical actions such as unscrewing , cutting , grinding , and crushing . As such , maximum allowed concentrations set by the RoHS directive do not apply to the total weight of the finished product but to anything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an electrical product that is covered by a single plastic case that contains 1,500 parts per million ( 0.15 percent ) of the flame-retardant PBB would violate the directive no matter the size or weight of the overall product . REACH <p> The registration , evaluation and authorization of chemicals ( REACH ) regulation seeks to improve chemical management and regulation through the generation of better risk assessment data and stricter controls of the most hazardous chemicals . In many ways , REACH is a response to charges that EU chemical policy provided inadequate human health and environmental protection . For example , existing policies , dating back to the 1970s and early 1980s , distinguished between " existing " ( pre-1981 ) and " new " chemicals ( post-1981 ) . These policies left all pre-1981 chemicals essentially unregulated and their risks largely unassessed . The 1993 Regulation on Existing Substances placed existing chemicals under EU authority , but controls remained lower than for new chemicals . For most of the tens of thousands of existing chemicals , which make up more than 95 percent of all commercial chemicals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toxicity , and ecosystem or human health effects . REACH is designed to change this . <p> In addition , because producers need to present risk assessment data for every new substance they want to bring to market  --  information not required for existing substances  --  the separation between existing and new substances creates disincentives for innovation and substitution . Such incentives are particularly perverse because more information exists about newer chemicals , which might substitute for older ones , in terms of their properties and environmental behavior . Many critics also believe that the influence of precaution on EU chemical management remains too limited. 16 To this end , critics argue that European chemical assessment and regulation continue to rely too heavily on the need for clear scientific proof of harm . Also , significant differences in national implementation of EU chemical policy remain , yielding uneven regulatory outcomes for older policies . <p> The new REACH regulation will replace many existing chemical laws and abolish the regulatory distinction between existing and new chemicals . It requires approximately 30,000 existing substances to undergo a registration procedure over the next 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemicals produced or imported into the EU in quantities greater than 1 metric ton annually . Exceptions are made for polymers and intermediaries , and certain kinds of products are covered by separate regulations ( for example , pesticides , pharmaceuticals , and cosmetics ) . Chemicals manufactured in quantities greater than 1,000 metric tons per year and those that are carcinogenic , mutagenic , and reproductive toxicants will be registered during the first three years . For chemicals that are handled in quantities of at least 10 tons per year , the manufacturer or importer will have to compile a chemicals safety report . <p> During REACH 's evaluation process , a newly established European Chemicals Agency located in Helsinki , Finland , and designated national authorities in member states will collaborate and evaluate those chemicals identified during the registration procedure as being of particular concern . Such evaluation will assess the need for additional risk reduction measures in the form of use restrictions or complete bans . Chemicals determined to be of serious concern , based on the evaluation process , can be required to undergo an authorization process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities before selling or using such chemicals . Companies that want to keep using a chemical of high concern would also have to demonstrate to relevant authorities that the chemical can be used safely and that there are no viable alternatives for particular uses . EU Environmental Politics <p> The development of WEEE , RoHS , and REACH involved extensive negotiations between the European Commission , the European Council , and the European Parliament . It also included extensive stakeholder participation and intense lobbying by private sector and civil society groups . During the negotiations , many changes and compromises were made to proposed policies , particularly with respect to REACH . <p> The adopted versions of WEEE , RoHS , and REACH may not be as " green " as some had hoped . In contrast , others think the policies are much too costly , inflexible , and stringent . Nevertheless , WEEE , RoHS , and REACH significantly raise EU standards for the management of hazardous substances and e-waste . While the adoption of each policy is important , the directives ' long-term ability to change producer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building more sustainable societies . <p> Since the adoption of WEEE and RoHS , member states have worked to translate these directives into national legislation and regulations covering public authorities , domestic firms , and consumers . Five countries  --  United Kingdom , Germany , France , Spain , and Italy  --  account for 80 percent of all e-waste in Europe. 17 As such , effective implementation of WEEE and RoHS in these countries is critical for overall success in tackling the e-waste problem . Some EU countries , notably Belgium , Denmark , the Netherlands , and Sweden , had adopted domestic electronics waste legislation even before WEEE , and therefore needed to make only limited additions. 18 For many other countries , the implementation of WEEE demanded much domestic legislative and practical action. 19 In particular , the United Kingdom has been slow to translate the new EU legislation into domestic law. 20 <p> Simply put , REACH is one of the largest and most complex environmental policies in European history . Because it is so recent , there have been only limited efforts on implementation to date . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lobbying , involving all major EU organizations , member states , and a host of environmental , consumer , and industrial interest groups . Whereas supporters of WEEE , RoHS , and REACH stress their contributions to greater human health protection and sustainability , opponents have expressed concerns about , for example , the economic costs to individual firms and consumers and potential implications for international trade and/or jobs . <p> Environmental and consumer advocacy groups view WEEE as " common sense in practice . " 21 They also strongly support RoHS and REACH , arguing that too many substances about which too little is known have been used and released into the environment for too long. 22 Many EU member states also pushed for each of the three policies . In the 1990s , several environmental leader states wanted to move EU waste management policy further away from landfilling practices toward increased producer responsibility for the recovery , recycling , and environmentally sound disposal of e-waste . In this respect , WEEE is a continuation of earlier EU policy on recycling and increased producer responsibility . <p> EU member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are stricter than EU policy as long as these national policies comply with existing EU law ( primarily the principle of free movement of goods within the EU internal market ) . As such , member states may regulate additional products that are not specifically listed under the WEEE directive . Much European policy on extended producer responsibility was pioneered by Germany , the Netherlands , Denmark , and Sweden . Officials in these countries have worked to " trade up " their stricter national regulations to the EU level through EU processes designed to harmonize standards within the internal market. 23 Furthermore , firms from member states with more stringent domestic regulations often work with their national governments to upload policies to the EU level so their competitors are subject to similar requirements . <p> Similarly , member states have often led by example on hazardous substances management . Like many environmental groups , by the late 1990s officials from green leader countries , including Austria , Denmark , Germany , the Netherlands , Sweden , and the United Kingdom , were voicing dissatisfaction with the slow pace of EU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1999 , member states requested that the European Commission develop a new strategy for more effective chemical management , which initiated the policy process leading to the creation of REACH. 25 Some states , including Denmark , the Netherlands , and Sweden , have adopted national phase-out goals for hazardous substances that they are pursuing concurrent to EU goals . Sweden also adopted a goal of becoming a " mercury-free society , " which includes an intention to ban the use of mercury completely as of 2007. 26 <p> Many member-state representatives worked closely with the Directorates-General ( DG ) Environment staff in the European Commission on WEEE , RoHS , and REACH . Leader states used the common technique of placing national experts in DG Environment staff and advisory positions to assist in the development of background documents and policy proposals . DG Environment , under the leadership of commissioners Ritt Bjerregaard ( Denmark , 1995-1999 ) and Margot Wallstrm ( Sweden , 1999-2004 ) also focused much political attention on chemical safety and the management of e-waste . <p> In the European Parliament , the Committee on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to strengthen environmental standards related to WEEE , RoHS , and REACH. 27 As such , this committee generated and helped to organize a great deal of EU-level support for WEEE , RoHS , and REACH . Committee members , Green Party Members of the European Parliament ( MEPs ) , and other MEPs from numerous EU countries also pressed for strong legislation during parliamentary plenary reviews of legislative proposals during the co-decision procedures with the Council of Ministers. 28 <p> WEEE , RoHS , and REACH do more than raise national regulatory standards across EU member states ; they also greatly increase the responsibilities of private sector entities . Traditionally , waste management and the assessment of chemicals were the responsibility of public authorities . In contrast , WEEE , RoHS , and REACH shift much of the responsibility for e-waste management and the generation of risk assessment data onto producers and users . WEEE increases the responsibility of producers of electronic and electrical products to recycle their own products after they have been used . RoHS mandates that producers remove regulated hazardous substances from a long list of products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generate extensive data about existing chemicals and provide such data to authorities for assessment and regulation . <p> The European chemical industry is Europe 's third largest manufacturing industry  --  directly employing 1.7 million people  --  and it has been particularly active in the policy process. 29 In fact , it has been said that REACH " attracted more hostility from industry than any other item of EU environmental legislation in 30 years . " 30 Major chemical companies such as Bayer , BASE and Shell Chemicals initially rejected outright the idea of creating a registration , evaluation , and authorization scheme for existing chemicals. 31 They argued that it would be too economically and administratively burdensome , threatening their international competitiveness. 32 As demonstrated by a change in policy position over time , the European chemical industry has moved away from opposing REACH per se to trying to reduce industry requirements , as it became clear that a proposal would go forward . <p> Much has been said about economic costs of the new EU policies , particularly regarding REACH . In 2001 , the European Commission estimated an additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry as a result of REACH. 33 In contrast , an industry estimate projected additional costs of 7.8 billion. 34 Other industry-commissioned studies predicted 2.35 million job losses and a 6.4 percent reduction in German gross domestic product ( GDP ) alone . The studies also estimated the cost to the French chemical industry at 29 billion to 54 billion over 10 years and 670,000 jobs. 35 These studies , however , have been widely attacked as being based on " false economics " in their calculations of direct and indirect costs. 36 REACH defenders also stress that environmental and human health benefits must be considered , and that benefits should be included from stimulated innovation and reduced costs of cleaning up contaminated sites and managing wastes that come as a result of proactive regulation. 37 <p> Some EU bodies such as the Commission 's DG Enterprise , and EU parliamentary committees , such as the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy and the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection , have shared many of the financial concerns expressed by chemical industry officials. 38 The industry also receives support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from many conservative and socialist MEPs . In general , compared to REACH debates , there has been less private sector opposition to WEEE and RoHS . Those debates centered more on practical aspects of implementation  --  such as the design of national organizations for collection and e-waste management , than on their general desirability. 39 Nevertheless , the concerns and lobbying activity of private sector stakeholders were integral to the development of all three hazardous substances and e-waste policies . The EU 's Global Reach <p> Expansion of EU hazardous substances and e-waste policy under WEEE , RoHS , and REACH already influences firms and political actors beyond the EU 's borders-from the its recent inclination to enact ambitious and comparatively high environmental policy standards , yield both international economic and political influence . International Markets and Economic Influence <p> With a population of nearly 500 million and an annual market of about $11 trillion there are few large multinational companies that do not operate or sell their products in the EU . Regulatory standards set in Brussels can have significant implications for international production and trade . If non-EU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EU , they will have to comply with EU product rules and standards . Most firms operating in multiple markets prefer to produce their products to as few different standards as possible , and they often follow the highest regulatory standard . This is particularly likely for products where major producers compete across markets . For example , if HP or Dell needs to redesign their laptops or substitute chemicals used in their production to meet EU standards , WEEE , RoHS , and REACH may also affect laptops made and bought outside the EU . <p> This international market-based influence of WEEE , RoHS , and REACH reflects a broader change in global standard setting . Historically , many product standards for consumer and environmental protection were set in the United States because of the size of the U.S. economy and the stringency of early U.S. standards. 40 Whereas U.S. chemical policy in the 1970s and the early 1980s often acted as an inspiration for European policymaking , the EU has taken over the role as leader in chemical policy development. 41 The EU is increasingly replacing the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center of much global regulatory standard setting is shifting from Washington , DC , to Brussels. 42 New EU policies  --  and similar policies being enacted in response in other parts of the world  --  are also engendering responses in international markets . <p> In other words , the importance of WEEE , RoHS , and REACH extends far beyond the EU border through processes of international economic integration and trade . One U.S. engineer recently noted that RoHS " is probably the biggest change in electronics in 50 years " for the United States ( and global ) electronics business. 43 A recent report also suggests that the costs to U.S. firms for complying with REACH are far lower than the benefits of continued and expanding transatlantic trade. 44 This suggests they must adjust and absorb the costs of doing so . In addition , a rapidly growing market in consulting services to help producers comply with the growing array of national and international regulations has emerged . Such services are likely to quickly diffuse information about the new EU chemical and waste policies and the responsibilities they place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . International Political Influences <p> Policy ideas and information about environmental and human health risks travel across borders . They do so in part because individuals and organizations with similar values and interests import and export information and ideas for strategic purposes . For example , policymakers , regulators , and environmental or consumer advocates might ask why , if certain substances are deemed too risky for use in Europe , are they still being used in the United States or China ? Similarly , if firms can afford to collect their used electronic products in Europe for recycling and/or disposal , some actors will ask why they oppose such responsibilities in the United States or elsewhere . In fact , such questions are already being asked , and the politics of chemical and e-waste management already show signs of change well beyond EU borders . <p> Many non-EU governments look to the EU for policy guidance about hazardous substances and e-waste management . For example , in 1998 , Japan enacted legislation on the recycling of household appliances that requires industry to establish a recovery and recycling system for discarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of e-waste more broadly . Because much of Japanese environmental legislation tends to follow EU legislation , Japan may look to the EU for further policy guidance on how to improve hazardous substances and e-waste management . China  --  the world 's largest producer of cellular phones and color TVs  --  is in the process of developing and implementing RoHS-like legislation , which , after some delays , is scheduled to enter into force in 2007. 46 China has also expressed interest in copying ideas underpinning REACH . In addition , South Korea is in the process of finalizing its own national RoHS legislation modeled after the EU's. 47 <p> European actors also want other jurisdictions to adopt similar chemical and waste policies . Now that EU standards have increased , European officials , European environmental organizations , and European firms have shared interests in exporting EU standards to other countries and in uploading such standards into international agreements . Political scientist David Vogel argues that such shared interests lead to coalitions of environmental actors and firms  --  " Baptists and bootleggers "  --  that use market forces to " trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-standing EU strategy , dating from the first Environment Action Programme in 1973 , of active engagement in international forums to achieve goals that could not be obtained solely at a regional level. 49 As such , the EU can be expected to pursue the uploading of its new chemical and waste management policies in a host of international forums . <p> In the United States , recycling legislation is largely left to the discretion of states . Some states with a high concentration of high-tech industries such as California , Florida , New York , Oregon , Texas , Virginia , and Washington have taken legislative measures on e-waste that go beyond federal U.S. regulations with an eye toward the latest European policy developments. 50 In 2003 , California passed an electronic waste recycling act that bans the sale ( after 1 January 2007 ) of electronic devices that are prohibited under RoHS . In 2006 , New York City Council members debated whether to require producers of a long list of electronic products to set up a city-wide take-back system. 51 Several U.S.-based companies , including Apple , AT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in WEEE management in the United States and internationally. 52 In addition , California and other states looking to strengthen their chemical policies are closely following developments in REACH . <p> The EU and the United States are the two main global producers and users of chemicals : Europe accounts for more than one-third and the United States accounts for one-fourth of global chemical production with extensive transatlantic trade in chemicals. 53 Furthermore , the EU and the United States are also large generators of e-waste . Together , the U.S. government and industry organizations have lobbied intensively against these EU policy developments , targeting the European Commission , the European Parliament , and national politicians and policymakers. 54 Yet while U.S.-based firms have lobbied European officials extensively over REACH and other proposals , they typically do not carry the same political influence in Brussels and other European capitals as they do in Washington , DC . <p> Despite this interest in EU policy developments from U.S. states , municipalities , and firms , the U.S. federal government and some industry organizations have been fierce critics of WEEE , RoHS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their major criticisms , the U.S. State Department and the United States Mission to the European Union distributed a report by the National Foreign Trade Council in 2003 on several EU policy developments , including WEEE , RoHS , and REACH , that argued : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Needless to say , the European Commission and many European politicians and policymakers strongly reject these claims . EU officials assert that the precautionary principle is not " non-scientific " but an indispensable principle for guiding decisionmaking on risk under conditions of uncertainty regarding effective environmental and human health protection . WEEE , RoHS , and REACH are also designed to stimulate technical innovation to reduce the use of hazardous substances and make recycling and disposal of e-waste easier . In addition , the European Commission argues that all recent EU legislation is compatible with the rules of the World Trade Organization . <p> Although the Bush administration and the U.S. chemical industry continue in their strong opposition to much EU environmental policymaking , a growing number of other countries , U.S. states , and private firms are looking to the EU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substances and e-waste . Once WEEE , RoHS , and REACH are fully operational , they are likely to further influence international production and regulatory standards . REACH , for example , will generate massive amounts of information about chemicals and is likely to improve the ability to comparatively assess the risks of various chemicals . Environmental advocates in the United States , China , and many other places will pay close attention to such information . Conclusion <p> Like the burning of fossil fuels , the use of chemicals and heavy metals has radically improved human life , making it considerably less " nasty , brutish , and short , " even as they pose severe ecological and human health risks . The same can be said for the growing use of electronic products , which results in mountains of e-waste . A critical question before public , private , and civil society actors concerns how best to preserve and enhance the tremendous gains in human well-being made for many of us from the use of chemicals , heavy metals , and modern technology , while engendering more environmentally and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better living through chemistry "  --  to cite the old DuPont slogan  --  will require higher regulatory standards to more effectively manage chemical hazards and e-waste . <p> Ongoing EU efforts to deepen economic and political integration , raise regulatory standards , and promote sustainable development are guided by a series of EU-wide strategies , action programs , and policies adopted in recent years . Critics have argued , however , that some of these efforts may not be compatible. 56 For example , EU economic policies tend to promote Western-style consumption while EU environmental policy supports waste minimization and recycling . In this respect , the EU  --  and all member states  --  faces the critical challenge of formulating and implementing a coherent strategy for promoting economic growth that is socially and environmentally sustainable . Nevertheless , as the EU seeks to do this , policymakers , regulators , corporate managers , environmental and consumer activists , and consumers not just in Europe but across the globe will be affected . <p>                   @ @
