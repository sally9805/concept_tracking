1 . The Linguistic Problem <p> Problems of theory often tend to be problems of language and this is especially-though not exclusively-the case in the so-called humanities . The debate on the nature of fiction is a case in point . The problems concerning the concept of fiction start with the fact that the term " fiction " has been applied to a considerable variety of phenomena at different times and in different places . This would not , in and of itself , create too much of a problem if only scholars were sufficiently aware of this fact . <p> In the English-speaking world , the term " fiction , " when used to denote a type of text , often relates only to narrative fictional texts . This can be illustrated by reference to the German translation of Wayne Booth 's The Rhetoric of Fiction as Die Rhetorik der Erzhlkunst , i.e. , " The Rhetoric of Narrative Art . " But the book deals exclusively with narrative fiction and not with fictional texts in general , as the use of the German term Fiktion would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons that the debate on fictionality , which is grounded in logic and the philosophy of language , centers largely on narrative texts-after all , this approach to the issue is dominated by English-speaking scholars . Some scholars explicitly mention this " limitation " ( e.g. , Richard Routley ( n1 ) ) without being aware , however , of the problems it entails . Jonathan Culler is one of the few scholars who actually address these problems . He , too , applies the term " fiction " in the common sense as it is used by " publishers , booksellers , and most readers , except some theoretically inclined specialists . " According to Culler " fiction " is an umbrella term denoting " imaginative prose narratives . as opposed to poetry , on the one hand , which will not be found in the fiction section , nor on the fiction bestseller list , and to non-fiction on the other " ( 2 ) . Even though Culler himself proceeds to discuss the issue of fiction only with respect to narrative texts , he does draw attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one hand , contrasts fiction with poetry and . on the other , with nonfictional narratives such as reports , historiography , etc . <p> While in the English-speaking world the use of the term " fiction " in its everyday sense has led to poetry being banned from the realm of fiction and . thus , in most cases , from recent theories of fictionality , ( n2 ) English-speaking scholars do sometimes include drama in the scope of what they call " fictional discourse . " John Searle , for instance , discusses the specific conditions which constitute fictionality in dramatic texts ( 327-29 ) . <p> The vast majority of German-speaking scholars consider it natural that a theory of fictionality must in equal measure refer to narrative , dramatic , and poetic texts ; this is exemplified , for instance , by the texts on which Rainer Warning bases his discussion of the pragmatic relation to fictionality . Only a few individual scholars , such as Kate Hamburger or Harald Fricke , exclude " poetry " or , more precisely , certain varieties of " poetry " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fictionality and the specific textual markers that these theories establish as signals of fictionality. ( n3 ) <p> If a theory of fictionality can be defined by criteria deriving from the explicitly stated or implied extension ( n4 ) of this very term , it is obviously just as possible for the extension of the term to be delimited by a theory of fictionality . As I will try to show , it seems necessary to define criteria of fictionality in relation to specific groups of texts , yet it must be noted that this can not be the exclusive approach and that one has to be aware of the differing status of various individual criteria or sets of criteria . <p> It is obviously impossible to cover all the different concepts of fictionality within a single theory . Nevertheless , if we wish to engage in a discussion of the nature of fictionality-and the subject seems to have gained in importance recently-it seems necessary first to take a critical look at what aspects the existing theories of fictionality actually refer to . It is equally important to make explicit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have informed these various concepts . Only then , as a second step , will it be possible to discuss how " useful " such an explicitly stated or merely implied extension of a given concept of fictionality may actually be . 2 . The Problem of Function <p> The terminological problem and the problem ofthe potential extension ofthe concept of fiction are linked to the question of the function that a concept of fiction is expected to fulfill , i.e .. the question of the purpose for which the term " fiction " is employed or for which a theory of fictionality has been constructed . Among literary scholars , at least , there seems to be agreement that the concept of fiction serves , or may possibly serve , to establish a typology of texts , for instance , to distinguish fictional from nonfictional texts . Widespread and generally accepted as the distinction between fictional and nonfictional texts may seem , it remains unclear how this distinction can be applied to the multiplicity of historically given groups of texts . <p> Earlier scholarship was prone to posit either explicitly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of literary texts in general or of certain specific types of literary discourse , such as the literary form of narrative . Nowadays , however , it is becoming increasingly clear that " fictionality " is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition of " literature . " Siegfried Schmidt 's changing views on the problem of fiction can be taken as exemplary of this development. ( n5 ) Karlheinz Stierle , too , assumes that fiction is primarily a literary or an aesthetic phenomenon . This becomes especially clear when he characterizes " fictionality " as the self-referentiality of language ( " Die Fiktion " 181 ) . ( n6 ) Like Stierle 's work , Wolfgang Iser 's is haunted by the problem of how to distinguish between " literature " and " fiction . " Iser asserts that the " act of feigning . has since time immemorial been considered the fundamental characteristic of literature " ( " Akte " 129 ) . Yet he then goes on to explain that " the literary fictional text " can be distinguished from other forms of fiction because the former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution is unsatisfactory : Iser acknowledges the existence of " fictionality " outside literature while simultaneously elevating fictionality to a defining characteristic of literature . After all , even though literary history provides many examples of fictions that put their fictionality on display , there are just as many instances of fiction that do not . One need only think of the strategies of authentication prevalent in several varieties of eighteenth-century novels , novels which devote a considerable degree of energy to veiling their fictionality . <p> Thus , it seems more fruitful to take a closer look at the various attempts to establish basic distinctions between " literature " and " fiction . " Searle gives three reasons why " literature " ought to be distinguished from " fiction . " Unfortunately , none of them survives closer scrutiny . It is impossible to distinguish " literature " from " fiction , " as Searle does , by defining " literature " as a comparative term and " fiction(ality) " as one with a categorizing function . Neither , as we shall see later ( section 3 below ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristic . And finally , it seems highly problematic to leave the definition of a text 's literariness to the reader while arguing at the same time that it is the author who decides on a given statement 's fictionality. ( n7 ) As Gottfried Gabriel points out , " fictionality " is neither a sufficient nor a necessary condition of literature since there exists literature which is nonfictional just as there are fictional discourses which are not perceived as literary ( " Fiction and Truth " 543 ) . ( n8 ) Marie-Laure Ryan ( " Fiction as a Logical " ) puts things more vaguely by claiming that literature need not necessarily be fictional , just as fictionality can manifest itself outside literature , only to assert that literariness and fictionality achieve " their purest manifestation " in literature ( 121 ) . This list of views could easily be extended ad infinitum . What it demonstrates is that the precise relation between " literature " and " fiction " still requires clarification . <p> It seems obvious that the answer to the question whether a particular group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to define fictionality . The fact that the theoretical terms employed depend to such a high degree on the nature of the respective underlying theories need not create undue concern . This is a problem the humanities share with other fields of knowledge , including , according to recent views , the sciences ( Stegmller . Theorienstruktur 45-47 ) . What makes the matter in hand so problematic is the fact that the concept of the literary must always be defined as historically variable  --  if only because the modern concept of literature did not exist prior to the eighteenth century ( Escarpit ) . Hence , if the binary opposition of " literary " versus " nonliterary " is to make any sense at all . it will have to be flexible enough to permit us to label one and the same type of text as either literary or nonliterary. depending on which period of literary history we are actually dealing with . But if " fictionality "  --  irrespective of how one defines it  --  is to be considered a necessary , let alone a sufficient condition of literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and be exclusive to them . If . therefore , the definition of the literary text changes over time , there can be no logically necessary relation between fictionality and literature . Nor does such a relation exist empirically , as has rightly been noted ( see Anderegg ; Stempel 390 ; and Ihwe and Rieser 72 ) . To mention only one example : whereas Aristotle quite explicitly excluded the didactic poem from the realm of poetry , later authorities have included it ( Fabian ) . In fact , none ofthe usual criteria of fictionality applies to the didactic poem . Conversely , there are texts , such as advertisements , which are traditionally considered nonliterary , yet which , to a large extent , fulfill the usual criteria of fictionality . Nevertheless , they are not generally considered literary . This is not to say that there is no relation between fictionality and literature . The question is merely what that relation consists in . <p> As can easily be demonstrated , even studies aiming at establishing a historicizing concept of fictionality implicitly stress the systematic character of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discourse as " the illocutionary mode of acting as if " den illokutionren Modus eines Als-ob-Handelns ( 191 ) , and defines it as linked to a specific communicative situation . Thus , he does not . as he claims , provide a " definition based on the historical situation in question . " but rather a " systematic description "  --  an approach he himself rejected originally . Not until Warning discusses the different manifestations of the literary according to his criterion with reference to texts from the Middle Ages to modernity does he begin to historicize . Similarly , the debate between Hans Robert Jauss and Warning , on the one hand , and Hans Gumbrecht , on the other , as to whether the authors and the audiences of the medieval romance possessed a consciousness of fictionality and regarding the issue when the distinction between " fiction " and " reality " was first made . presupposes a systematically defined concept of fictionality ( see Warning 19498 ; Jauss ; and Gumbrecht ) . This is because change can only be measured against standards that remain constant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had changed or what changes had taken place . <p> Consequently , it is necessary to distinguish between a concept of literature , poetry , or such like , a concept that can only be reconstructed historically , and a concept of fictionality , which must be systematic . While the former is grounded in historically-changing norms and conventions , and differentiates certain groups of texts within the sum total of texts , the latter is theory-based and seeks to establish a specific mode of relating " language " to extralinguistic reality . If one thus takes " fictionality " to be such a systematic concept as opposed to the historically changing concept of " literature , " then it is possible to describe historically variable relations between the two concepts that might provide important insights into a given literary system. ( n9 ) <p> Whereas literary studies and linguistics discuss fiction(ality) primarily in terms of textual typology , in the philosophy of language the debate on the nature of fictionality focuses almost exclusively on the issue of the referential quality of such terms as " Pegasus , " " Sherlock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem of how the truth of propositions containing such terms can be determined . This line of scholarship investigates how we can possibly retain the notion of a referential semantics , i.e. , a system that establishes meaning through the relationship between language and the real world , in the face of terms and phrases that have no corresponding entities in extralinguistic reality . Richard Rorty provides an overview of the most important attempts at solving the problem from Bertrand Russell to Saul Kripke , without ever evincing an awareness of the fundamental ambiguity of his term " fictional discourse . " Whereas Searle does , indeed , discuss a particular type of discourse , and in so doing makes an explicit distinction between fictional discourse and the theory of fiction ( 329 ) , the majority of the attempts to approach the issue in terms of the philosophy of language are not at all concerned with the problem of how fictional discourse is constituted . What they are interested in is the epistemological question of what happens when one talks about fiction . <p> Thus it is remarkable that Nicholas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory demands a " sharp differentiation between the function of proper names of characters within fiction and their function outside of fiction in predications concerning those characters " ( 101 ) , a demand which implies that other theories do not make this distinction . It is difficult , however , to understand why a theory that treats the truth of propositions about fictional phenomena  --  a theory that must needs be metalinguistic  --  should be identical with a theory of fictionality , since this would mean that one and the same theory would cover the truth of such propositions as " Rome is the capital of Italy " and " Rome i.e. the word ' Rome ' is monosyllabic . " Consequently , we have to question the wisdom of an approach that seeks to discuss metafictional propositions  --  a form of discourse that links propositions to other propositions ( or more precisely : texts )  --  within a theory of referentiality that is by definition grounded in the relationship between language and extralinguistic reality . Moreover , the question remains as to how to apply to fictional discourse itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such markers are prone to counterintuitively " normalize " the specificities of fictional texts . Nevertheless , we have to admit that , even though the philosophy of language does not , or does not primarily , discuss the conditions that constitute fictional discourse , ( n10 ) but rather focuses on the truth-value of propositions containing nonreferential terms or phrases , the subtlety and precision to be encountered in the discussion of referentiality by the students of philosophy is such that it ought not to be neglected by students of linguistics , literary theory , or semiotics . <p> Apart from the two functions of the concept of fictionality just sketched  --  fictionality as a criterion to differentiate between " literary " and " nonliterary " texts and fictionality as a specific quality of a specific type of proper names  --  there is another way of defining the concept , a way enabling us to subsume the broadest variety of groups of texts or types of proposition under it . This possibility has existed since Hans Vaihinger 's Philosophy of " As If " ( 1911 ) , whose subtitle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fictionality : A System ofthe Theoretical , Practical and Religious Fictions of Mankind . Such a broad concept of fiction is to be found predominantly among theories based more or less exclusively on a vague understanding of nonreferentiality , namely on the simple fact that fictional propositions refer in one way or another to things that are " nonreal . " This is a criterion that most  --  but not all  --  texts traditionally considered literary share with deductive theories as well as with dreams , lies , hypotheses , conditional clauses , and the like ( van Dijk 336 ) . Applied in this manner , the concept of fiction , however , loses its differentiating function and ceases to be useful for distinguishing groups of texts . Furthermore , a number of studies have already introduced distinctions making clear that it is not merely counterintuitive but also theoretically untenable to assign fictional narratives to the same category or type of discourse as hypotheses , ( n11 ) lies , ( n12 ) or counterfactual propositions ( Ryan , " Fiction " ) . These arguments are valid even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , naturally , dependent on the criteria of fictionality implied by each of these perspectives . <p> Another question that ought to be raised in this context is whether it is sensible to discuss the specific character of theoretical terms in the context of a theory of fiction . After all , a closer scrutiny of the " fictionality " ( or more precisely : the constructedness ) of theoretical terms reveals that , especially with respect to the problem of referentiality , there are fundamental differences between this type of constructedness and the structure and function of fictional discourse in literature. ( n13 ) Hence , it is not surprising that Iser has such difficulties in finding a common basis for the various concepts of fiction prevailing in different scholarly and scientific disciplines . This difficulty does not arise from a " specific characteristic ofthe fictive " in the sense of an ontological quality , but rather from something much simpler , namely the fact that different types of discourses use the same term for very different purposes of analysis ( " Das Fiktive " 547 ) . The fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is employed for such diverse purposes is due to the way " fiction " or " the fictional " are used in everyday speech , where they serve as antonyms of " reality " or " the real . " Thus , it is this use ofthe term " fiction " according to the custom of everyday speech , a custom based on the vaguely-defined criterion of nonreferentiality , that explains the particular popularity of the term . <p> Quite apart from the terminological problem and the problem of function , the issue of fictionality is haunted by yet another problem , a problem deriving from the very nature of concept formation . This is because the majority ofthe various theories of fictionality are based on a classificatory understanding of concepts , an understanding that I now wish to problematize. 3 . The Conceptual Problem <p> In the strict sense of the term we are dealing with a classificatory concept if it is possible to break down a given field of objects or ideas into disjunct subcategories . With respect to the matter in hand , this would mean that any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or nonfictional . Classificatory concepts contrast with comparative concepts , " relational concepts , which enable us to make comparisons in terms of ' more or less ' . " ( n14 ) Recent research has thrown into doubt the usefulness of a classificatory concept of fiction . For instance , Harald Weinrich , in his debate with Stierle , points out that purely fictional types of texts can be distinguished from purely nonfictional types but that there is a " scale " of texts in-between these poles consisting of types of texts characterized by a greater or lesser degree of fictionality ( " Fiktionssignale " 525 ) . ( n15 ) Hence , Weinrich coins the term " signal of fictionality "  --  obviously in analogy with his term " signal of irony . " According to Weinrich , the majority of texts are characterized by a " mixture of signals , some of which point to fictionality and others to nonfictionality " ( 526 ) . <p> Weinrich 's suggestion has two advantages . First , it is possible , by drawing on recent developments in the philosophy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a concept neither purely classificatory nor purely comparative  --  a precise conceptual status . Second , Weinrich 's position permits us to include in our theorizing the historical variability of concrete instances of fictionality . And that is a crucial advantage , since , obviously , there is a fundamental difference between a text veiling its fictionality and one flaunting it . <p> Apart from classificatory and comparative concepts , the contemporary philosophy of language also distinguishes so-called " ( proto ) type concepts . " One of Franz von Kutschera 's examples may serve to illustrate this : the term " pyknic " represents such a type concept. ( n16 ) Here , too , it is possible , to claim that a certain human being is either a pyknic or not , but nevertheless not all pyknics are pyknics in the same way , just as fictional texts are not all fictional in the same way . Pure cases of pyknics tend to be rare and most human beings ' physical statures display both pyknic and nonpyknic characteristics . " Here it makes sense to say : A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , i.e. , being a pyknic is not merely a question of ' either/or ' but also of ' more or less ' " ( 200 ) . Thus ( proto ) type concepts contain both classificatory and comparative aspects . In the light of Weinrich 's ideas , we can now also conclude that this state of affairs is also characteristic of fictionality . By extending Wittgenstein 's notion of family resemblance , von Kutschera has rendered the conceptual structures sketched above more precise  --  a matter that can not be further discussed in this context . <p> It is my view that the basic idea of the type concept will play a crucial role in overcoming certain aporias of the debate on fictionality . I will provide only a brief sketch of the logical operations involved , using the example of fictionality discussed in this article . According to the notion of the type concept , predicates such as " being fictional , " i.e. , predicates displaying the double nature of being both classificatory and comparative , are defined with respect to specific classes of examples and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the resultant class of fictional texts or utterances is conceived of as the set of objects which are more similar to the elements of the class of examples E i than to the elements of the class of examples E k , with i ? k. ( n17 ) This conceptual frame would make it possible to establish sets of potential characteristics of fictional texts , an operation to be grounded on texts that one intuitively deems to be particularly fictional . Such an approach would enable us to describe , moreover , how in specific texts these characteristics are combined and realized in different ways . The type of conceptualization involved is that which Wittgenstein developed using the notion of " game . " Consequently , fictionality would not consist in the necessary and exclusive presence of one or more elements in all fictional texts , ( n18 ) but rather in a complex of elements that might vary from text to text . This approach would make it possible to specify criteria of fictionality in relation to different discourses , styles , and genres . The criterion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hence it is necessary to take a closer look at the criteria themselves . 4 . The Difference between " Signals of Fiction " and " Characteristics of Fiction " <p> The question of whether fictionality is grounded in textual structures , or whether it can be described only in relation to specific attitudes either on the part of the author or the audience , has been debated at least since Schmidt 's statement on the issue ( " Ist ' Fiktionalitt ' ? " ) . On closer inspection this debate does not seem particularly fruitful . Two aspects render it particularly pointless . On the one hand , the debate is complicated by the fact that the discussion depends on the definitions of predicates such as " textual structure , " " linguistics , " " textual theory , " and " pragmatics . " On the other hand , this debate is fraught with the problem that the majority of the participants fail to distinguish between the characteristics of fiction and the signals of fiction . Stierle seems to be moving towards such a distinction in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " fictionality " as being anchored in textual structures . In his answer Stierle argues that it is necessary to distinguish between the question of " which characteristics define fictionality ? " and the practical issue of " how can I discover these characteristics in a given text ? " ( " Fiktion " 523 ) . Using the commonest of the common criteria of fiction , I will illustrate both the necessary distinction between characteristics of fiction , on the one hand , and signals of fiction , on the other . I will also discuss the rather questionable distinction between textual and nontextual characteristics of fiction  --  a distinction only possible for the characteristics of fiction , since the signals of fiction are , by definition , textual . <p> A majority of theories of fiction use as a criterion of fictionality the nonreferential quality of proper names and definite descriptions such as " the author of L ' ducation sentimentale . " It does not matter whether this criterion is employed within the context of referential semantics , of speech act theory , of possible-worlds semantics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " or in entirely intuitive ways. ( n19 ) Whether or not a name like Frederic Moreau in Flaubert 's L'Education sentimentale is referential can not be gleaned from the text itself but can only be ascertained on the basis of a " knowledge of the world . " Consequently , the nonreferentiality of proper names and definite descriptions obviously does not constitute a signal of fiction , but , if anything , a characteristic of fiction , a characteristic , moreover , which in isolation does not provide either a necessary or a sufficient condition of fictionality. ( n20 ) Yet it is precisely this characteristic that many scholars ascribe to the realms of " textual structure , " " semantics , " etc. ( n21 ) Conversely , some scholars reject the notion of textual criteria of fictionality altogether : " There is no textual property , syntactical or semantic , that will identify a text as a work of fiction , " Searle posits , which is why " the identifying criterion for whether or not a text is a work of fiction must of necessity lie in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not only does Searle here fall back into naive intentionalism , which in itself must be considered outdated , ( n22 ) but in his example passage he also identifies the omniscient narrator of a novel by Iris Murdoch as the author . Hence , he ascribes intentions to an entity that is established through the text , intentions that are traceable only in the text and can thus be accessed only through the text . The same is true of other approaches that base their conventions of fictionality on a " contract between author and reader " ( Searle 331 ) . The reader must , after all , be informed in one way or the other , must receive some sort of signal that he or she is to apply the relevant conventions. ( n23 ) <p> Thus it does not seem to he particularly helpful to continue debating the " level " at which a theory of fiction ought to be placed . What is crucial is the distinction between characteristics of fiction and signals of fictionality . Signals of fictionality are relevant within communicative situations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the audience of a text recognizes that text as fictional  --  always granted that the audience possesses an adequate knowledge of the discursive conventions contemporary with that text . Characteristics of fiction , on the other hand , are components of a theory that attempts to reconstruct a historically given understanding of fictionality by explicitly stating the conditions to be fulfilled in order to characterize a text as more or less fictional . Naturally , these conditions exceed what has been explicitly signalled . Otherwise , it would be possible to define fictionality merely by " reading it off from the texts . Hence , signals of fictionality can be understood as the historically variable manifestations of characteristics of fictionality . This insight has two consequences . First , all signals of fictionality must be traceable to characteristics of fiction , but not the other way around . Second , the enduring characteristics of fiction must be defined in such a manner as to permit different forms of manifestation . Thus , characteristics of fiction can not be described simply as a complex of elements , but have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , I will have to take a brief look at some frequently-mentioned criteria of fictionality , criteria which assume different positions on the scale between the criterion of referentiality , on the one hand , and that of a contract between author and reader , on the other . The former criterion is usually understood as based in textual structure , the latter as being nontextual . A number of studies agree that fictional texts possess a specific way of staging the speech situation  --  though these studies tend to differ with respect to the particular criteria and their theoretical premises . All these approaches tend to double the speech situation . Thus , at the level of production , they distinguish between the author of the text as a whole , as opposed to the text 's internal speaker or narrator , and , at the level of reception , between a textual addressee or a textually-implied reader as opposed to the text 's external audience . The text read by the external audience thus includes the role of an internal reader , just as the text 's author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n24 ) Some studies attempt to limit the speech criterion to only one genre . Thus , Harald Fricke distinguishes between narrative texts , whose fictionality he determines semantically  --  i , e. , through the criterion of referentiality  --  and dramatic texts , to which he exclusively assigns the doubling of the speech situation . Hence , he falls prey to fundamental absurdities , since , just as one must not confuse the hic-et-nunc-deixis of the dramatis personae in drama with the deixis " between actors and spectators ( or between playwright and reader ) " ( 443 ) , the " here " and the " now " in a novel are merely textual phenomena and the " I " of the narrator is not identical with that of the author. ( n25 ) <p> The fictionality of dramatic texts can be defined relatively easily . After all , ever since there have been theaters , the fictionality of the dramatic text has been marked institutionally  --  not to mention the multiplicity of fictional signals either textual or connected to a play 's performance . Even the most naive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on stage with the actual historical figure . Things get more complicated when Napoleon appears in a novel. ( n26 ) Even experienced critics still find it hard to distinguish clearly between the author and the narrator or speaker . The distinction between author and narrator , we must not forget , is a relatively recent methodological innovation  --  it did not occur until the twentieth century . The distinction between fiction and nonfiction , however , reaches back to sixteenth-century Italian literature at the latest , where we encounter concepts of fictionality prefiguring Coleridge 's " willing suspension of disbelief . " ( n27 ) Hence , the twofold system of communication inherent in the distinction between author and narrator can not as such be considered a signal of fiction . Rather , the distinction constitutes a characteristic of fiction , postulated within a theory of fiction because of manifest interpretive difficulties occasioned by unreliable narrators or an indubitably male author letting " his " story be told by a female narrator . Thus it is not the doubling of the role of the speaker that constitutes fictionality , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is considered fictional that one assumes a split between the author and the narrator and one between the implied audience and the reader . Hence , the text must express its own fictionality in such a manner as to preclude a nonfictional reception , or else the text will create ineluctable difficulties of understanding . <p> Consequently , the evolution of a general convention of fictionality is not due to the doubling of the communicative situation as such , but to certain cases in which a text 's internal communicative situation is staged in a particularly ostentatious manner. ( n28 ) This convention of fiction posits that within a specific group of texts  --  i.e. , the group which generally encompasses so-called literary texts in the modern sense  --  there is an a priori distinction between a communicative situation internal to the text and one external to it . The question of whether and to what extent such a distinction might be applicable also to certain nonliterary texts and discourses still requires further clarification. ( n29 ) A second question still to be clarified is that of whether it is possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a structural characteristic that forces us to adhere to the convention of fictionality even in cases in which an individual text seeks to obscure its own fictionality , i.e. , in certain forms of the first-person novel or in certain forms of poetry that pretend to be based on personal experience . Thus , we have finally arrived at the criterion of the " as if " which , ever since Vaihinger , has played a dominant role in a whole range of different theories of fictionality . <p> Even though Vaihinger was the first to explicitly name the " as if " as a criterion of fiction , there were previous attempts to theorize this phenomenon . Thus , European literary theory has known the criterion of verisimilitude ever since Aristotelian poetics , and the Italian Renaissance rediscovered it in the second half of the sixteenth century ( Weinberg , I : 349-52 ) , As Manfred Fuhrmann explains , this criterion of verisimilitude has always been used to problematize the distinction between the real and the non-real ( see also Kablitz 71n.11 ) , and thus , verisimilitude must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if . " If my subsequent analyses cast " as if " in the central role of a theory of fictionality , then it is not least because the concept of verisimilitude provides a historical foundation for the concept of the " as if "  --  though , of course , in a historically specific form. ( n30 ) Le vrai peut quelquefois n'estre pas vraisemblable , Boileau posits in his Art poetique ( 3.48 ) , This leads us directly to the problem of how fiction might be constituted , since fiction must be distinguished from the " true " or the " real " just as much as from the " false " or the " unreal . " ( n31 ) It was Margaret Macdonald who , for the first time after Vaihinger 's " model of explaining the world " ( Welterklrungsmodell )  --  a model I will not discuss in greater detail  --  employed the category of " as if " in discourse analysis . Unfortunately , the English original of Macdonald 's brilliant essay ( 1954 ) has remained virtually unnoticed . Had it received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fictionality could have been dispensed with . Long before Searle , Macdonald makes use of the category of " pretending " in order to describe the **26;1645;TOOLONG of fictional characters , ( n32 ) The category of " pretending " refers to the fact that the novelist invites his audience " to Imagine that .. , " " Pretend that . " and even " Suppose that . " or " Let it be granted that . " ( 171 ) , i.e. , it refers to the " acte de fiction " with which Grard Genette , too , is concerned . Ultimately , it establishes a definition of narrative fiction  --  and , as Macdonald makes clear , narrative fiction only ( see above n. 2 )  --  according to which narrative fiction does not make " true " or " false " statements but creates " reality , " though " a reality " whose " realness " resides entirely in its being constituted through language ( see esp , 175 ) . ( n33 ) <p> Searle , whose article I have quoted repeatedly , elevates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ category of " fictionality " : " the author of a work of fiction pretends to perform a series of illocutionary acts , normally of the representative type " ( 325 ) . Searle 's definition of the verb " to pretend " is as follows : " to engage in a performance which is as if one were doing or being the thing and is without any intent to deceive " ( 324 ) . Although Searle unambiguously refers to the concept of the " as if , " his approach remains problematic . Quite apart from the fact that he does not distinguish between author and narrator , he links the " as if " to illocutionary acts . After all , if one says that one is pretending the performance of speech acts of the representative type ( statements , assertions , descriptions , explanations , etc. ) , that must necessarily mean that one is not actually performing them . Thus Felix Martnez-Bonati seems to be right when he claims : <p> It is not possible to imagine narrated and described events if they are not actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . If the reader were to take the novelistic sentences not as effective assertions but as merely pretended assertions , they would not make sense to him , and he would not be able to derive from them the image of the fictional world . ( 429 ) <p> Rorty is even more radical in his critique of Searle 's solution to the problem of fictionality . According to Rorty , Searle 's solution is not only " trivial " ( 73 ) , but actually threatens to undo the relevance of Searle 's speech act theory for the establishing of meaning : <p> Searle tells us that words can mean the same when the rules governing their use change , because we pretend to obey the old rules . But if pretense is as good as reality , this throws doubt on the original claim that rules for performing speech-acts determine meaning . ( 73-74 ) . ( n34 ) <p> Since Searle 's attempt to ground the " as if " of fictional speech in speech act theory has met with such fundamental criticism even from philosophers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursue this line of argument any further . This can also be said of Gabriel 's approach , which he developed at the same time as Searle and which exhibits the same set of problems . Gabriel , for instance , claims that the speaker of a fictional text " speaks as if he were performing a particular kind of speech act , but in fact he is not performing this particular speech act at all . " ( n35 ) <p> If speech act theory 's attempts to define the nature of fiction must therefore be considered to have failed because of its insufficiently differentiated concepts of " speaking as if " ( Gabriel , " Fiction " 246 ) , we must ask ourselves in what way the " as if " can be operationalized more adequately . Iser does not reach any satisfactory conclusion either , since , while he does define fiction on the basis of an " as if " - relation , he also speaks of the " Als-Ob-Fiktion " and the " Fiktion des Als-Ob. " ( n36 ) This raises the question of whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fiction or whether " as if " itself is to be considered a fiction , i.e. , " feigned . " But it does not make sense to posit that the logical relation forming the very basis of " feigning " ( = fiction ) is , itself , " feigned . " At the end of the day , Iser defines fictionality only with respect to the " world represented , " more precisely : with respect to the Einklammerung ( " bracketing " ) of the world represented in the text ( 139 ) . ( n37 ) Moreover , structural linguistics has long considered the specific acts Iser calls " the acts of feigning , " i.e. , selection and combination , as basic categories of how linguistic utterances are constituted in general. ( n38 ) Consequently , selection and combination can hardly be termed specific characteristics of fiction . Nevertheless , intuitively , the " as if " - criterion seems to work so well that we should not abandon it merely because of the many difficulties it entails . Perhaps the following approach will render this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to return to the principle of similarity discussed at the end of the passage dealing with the terminological problem . Let us assume , first of all , that fictional texts are characterized by a certain set of characteristics , due to which different fictional texts share similarities , and that we can call a text fictional even if the exact configuration of the characteristics it displays differs from those displayed by other texts . This would permit us to be content with simply collecting these characteristics and hoping that their sum covers what we would " intuitively " consider fictional . Yet , such an approach would enable us to do no more than reconstruct a concept of " fictionality " based on the notions of everyday speech , as became evident in Wittgenstein 's example of the game . <p> We could , however , move beyond this state of affairs and ask what these characteristics have in common , thus asking the question as to what their " fictionality potential " consists in . Wittgenstein 's concept does not seem to lead us any further in this respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstraction , which consists in extrapolation from individual characteristics . Structuralism has , however , provided the basic idea that an object is not characterized so much by the elements it consists of but by the relations existing between these elements ( Piaget 81 ) . I wish to apply this concept to the problem of fictionality and to describe the similarity between the various characteristics as a " structure of fictionality . " If the " as if " is supposed to characterize fictional texts , then it has to be made visible within the principles which constitute discourse itself , or else we will encounter the difficulties sketched above . A text achieves an " as if " - structure through its very discourse-constituting procedures if it is structured in such a manner that it appears to be the manifestation of a specific type of discourse and yet signals that it does not really belong to this type of discourse . Thus , I believe it possible to define fictionality as an " as if " - structure , according to which fictional texts constitute themselves through a certain set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nonfictional discourse . Yet at the same time , fictional texts also contain other structures that reveal this isomorphism to be feigned . Hence , the traditional type of novel constitutes itself based on structures equally valid for the kind of oral narrative delivered by an eyewitness of a particular event , but the narrator in a novel is capable  --  due , for instance , to his omniscience  --  of possessing a degree of power over " his world " such as no normal narrator would ever possess . Dramatic texts seem to display their " as if " - structure even more glaringly . Because of the dominance of Kte Hamburger 's approach , the paradigmatic status dramatic texts have for a theory of fictionality has long been overlooked. ( n39 ) In the theater  --  which for the purposes of our argument we assume to be the traditional type of proscenium stage  --  it is the proscenium that serves as the central element constituting fiction . The proscenium functions as an explicit marker declaring that everything beyond it must be understood in terms of an " as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of classical tragedy retain certain general structures of " normal " dialogic communication . And it is the Theater of the Absurd which by abandoning these " normal " structures actually proves how important they are for constituting any dialogue . <p> The definition of fictionality as an " as if " - structure thus refers to what a particular set of texts have in common structurally . It has to be noted , however , that the " as if " - relation must always be seen in the context of a specific type of discourse . ( The problem of how to define any type of discourse  --  a definition potentially involving various levels  --  can not however be treated within the confines of this article ) . The " as if " - structure becomes manifest in particular texts or types of texts through different characteristics or signals whose common denominator is precisely that they share the basic dual structure defined earlier. ( n40 ) I wish to stress that the definition of " as if " sketched here is distinguished from traditional concepts by not referring only to the referential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the fictive world of the text and extratextual reality . The concept of " as if " that I wish to promote refers also to the relations between structures of discourses . The referential structure itself is only a partial element of that larger structure . As the examples cited above show , the term " structure , " as used here , refers also to the structure of the communicative situation , i.e. , not merely to syntactic or semantic phenomena but to " pragmatic " ones as well . The attempt at defining fictionality as sketched in this article is distinct both from approaches focusing on the principle of linguistic deviation , ( n41 ) and from approaches that seek to portray fiction simply as an " imitation " or " representation " of normal discourse. ( n42 ) It does , however , make possible the integration of already-established criteria , for instance , the criterion of referentiality , even though a certain degree of redefinition might be required. ( n43 ) <p> This also applies to the new characterization of descriptive passages in fictional narrative suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ texts are " superabundant , " i.e. have no explanatory function within the context of plot development , " they create the illusion of providing a description of a continuum of reality . They construct a background against which the narrative action appears to be merely selective " ( 80 ) . Hence , fictional narrative texts feign their ability to overcome the incompleteness of the reality they constitute . Kablitz thus redefines the criterion of the " incompleteness " of fictional worlds , ( n44 ) by focusing not on the de facto incompleteness of the " fictional world , " which is always constituted by a limited number of propositions , but on the " as if " - structure of fictional discourse , a structure seeking to create the " illusion " of limitlessness . Consequently , Kablitz 's theory can successfully incorporate a specific type of particularly nonillusionist narrative , that of the nouveau roman , since it can be shown how in the nouveau roman the exuberance of description makes transparent the illusion of completeness . Thus , the nouveau roman turns the " as if " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 82-84 ) . And this , in turn , proves that the systematic criterion of fictionality , as posited in this article , is capable of adequately describing historically different manifestations of fiction.
