<p> Divisadero By Michael Ondaatje 273 pages . Knopf. $25 . <p> In Michael Ondaatje 's " Divisadero " an illuminating exchange takes place between Lucien Segura , who will go on to become a famously mysterious French writer , and Marie-Neige , the young bride of a brutal older man . Lucien and Marie-Neige have been " like two flammable matches side by side in a tinderbox . " But their attraction , like many of the undercurrents in this turbulent , wandering novel , is one of many strong passions that can only indirectly be expressed . <p> Lucien has just been partially blinded by glass shards . Glass shards are among the recurring motifs here , and blindness exists among Mr. Ondaatje 's characters in many metaphorical forms . And so , since he and Marie-Neige love the same Dumas stories and happen to be living in Gascony , the homeland of Dumas 's D'Artagnan , she begins reading " The Three Musketeers " to Lucien aloud . When he Marie-Neige a question about the book 's first chapter , she is confused : Should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just go on , " Lucien tells her . " Not knowing something essential makes you more involved . " <p> " Divisadero " is a dramatic illustration of how Mr. Ondaatje follows that same precept . It is a book that improves on second reading because it is so willfully elliptical at first . Among the essential things the reader can not know , for instance , is what bearing the first half of the book has on the second , since they seem to be almost totally unrelated . Yet it turns out that there are many parallels , echoes , resonances , impulses , chirps ( the book is ever-attentive to symbolic import of bird life ) and creative curlicues that will present themselves to the patient admirer of Mr. Ondaatje 's work . <p> Speaking of patient : This author 's best books , of which " The English Patient " is the most prominent , all rely on such methods to a certain degree . Mr. Ondaatje does not write in mundanely linear ways , nor does he see events as isolated instances . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divisions in experience to break the spell of an ordinary world . But " Divisadero , " with a title that denotes distance , division and a street in San Francisco , is a more stubbornly eclectic Ondaatje book than most . <p> In what follows , numbers indicate elements of the book that will repeat themselves . The novel begins in California , in a rural paradise ( 1 ) , among family members whose relations are more acts of will than accidents of birth ( 2 ) . ( Numbered elements of the book are those that will repeat themselves . ) Claire and Anna were born at the same hospital and have been raised as twins , although they had different mothers . Their father is a tough , overbearing man ( 3 ) , which is made monstrously clear after Anna develops a passionate , unstoppable attraction ( 4 ) to Coop , the family 's young hired man . Coop has also been made part of this family , but that counts for nothing when the girls ' father catches him with Anna . A violent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this family 's life forever . <p> This explosion , Anna thinks later , was " in retrospect something very small , something that might occur within just a square inch or two of a Breughel , but it set fire to the rest of my life . " It made Anna leave the farm and permanently lose touch with Coop and Claire . Claire spends much of her time on horseback ( 6 ) , while Coop goes to Nevada and creates a whole new life as a gambler . " Divisadero " has a highly literary sensibility ( 7 ) , to the point where Coop is tricked into slipping up at a card game by talk of Tolstoy . <p> Distant war ( 8 ) ominously colors the periphery of the story . Coop 's gambling career is at its peak when the first gulf war begins , although it barely registers in the casinos of Nevada . " For the three thousand gamblers inhaling piped-in oxygen at the Horseshoe , the war is already a video game , taking place on a fictional planet , " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II rumble ominously from the fringes of the narrative . <p> Coop 's dealings with cards and women eventually destroy him , but not before he has re-encountered Claire , stirred her old memories and deeply hurt her by confusing her with Anna . All of this has been intercut with other facets of the story , to the point where it might be expected to continue . But then it disappears . And we are with Anna in France , where she finds meaning in her own life by plumbing the history of Lucien , now a famous dead literary figure . If this is arguably the most noxious conceit overworked in today 's fiction , trust Mr. Ondaatje at least to express it exquisitely . Taking up residence in Lucien 's house , Anna tells herself : " The manoir had once been the writer 's home , and she found herself in some modest contrapuntal dance with him . " Modest ? Hardly . It is contrapuntal in the extreme . <p> Since Mr. Ondaatje writes with such grace , he brings a haunting , sensual delicacy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anna and Raphael , who is more or less Lucien 's adopted son and has a fine , rustic way of keeping fragrant herbs in his pocket in case a loaf of bread comes along , wind up highly attuned to what happened between Lucien and Marie-Neige in the same setting . The water tower ( 9 ) that Coop once repaired morphs into a belfry repaired by Marie-Neige 's husband . The Sanskrit concept of gotraskhalana which has to do with calling a loved one by the wrong name , is everywhere within these goings on , and those who are not linked to the lives of others are linked to many different versions of themselves . Anna looks at birds ( 10 ) and knows that her secretive nature has created a flock of Annas within herself . <p> A more accurate synopsis of " Divisadero " would include the many loose ends and secondary developments that create an initial opacity . This underbrush is so dense that it takes work to cut through it and Mr. Ondaatje 's overview . But he is a writer of intense acuity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initially difficult , but the more you give " Divisadero , " the more it gives in return . <p> #
