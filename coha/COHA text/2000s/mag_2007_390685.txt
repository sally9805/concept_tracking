Westport Wash &; Wax proudly bills itself as the only solar powered carwash in the state of Connecticut . The proprietors , brothers Craig and Scott Tiefenthaler , have just covered the roof of their business with 18 panels . The total cost : $21,000 , with the state 's taxpayers footing 60 percent of the bill . This sort of behavior drives economists and global-warming skeptics to distraction . Even with the massive government subsidy , it 'll take seven years for the owners to recoup their investment . And on sunny days , the panels provide only enough juice to run the shop 's refrigerators and lights . " To run my main motors , I 'd need a city block of solar panels , " says Craig . At first blush , the carwash has all the hallmarks of a greenwash : a feel-good gesture that detracts attention from painful efforts that could really influence energy use . People who are serious about using less energy could skip the carwash altogether and bathe their vehicles with a hose and cold water . And if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should drive their Porsche Cayenne SUVs less frequently . But the Tiefenthalers , who have no advertising budget , have clearly made an economically rational choice . Within two weeks of installing the panels in August , the carwash was featured in the two local newspapers , a Web site covering Westport and the cable-news channel that covers Fairfield County . The New York Times has called , too . " We regard it as an effective form of advertising because of the image we 're trying to maintain and create , " Craig says . For companies large and small , going green is now a surefire way to cut through the clutter . A recent issue of the New York Times travel section included a brief article-complete with Web address-describing in loving detail the features of the Proximity Hotel , a green inn in Greensboro , N.C. Some hot hotels feature roofs with happening pool scenes . The Proximity 's roof features solar panels and a vegetable garden . The Wall Street Journal recently profiled Citigroup 's efforts to save $100 million on energy costs . Among the measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the heat in a Tampa office from 72 to 78 . ( It failed because sweltering employees revolted . ) Citigroup is going through one of its periodic dark nights of the soul . The giant bank is on the hook for billions of loans to private-equity deals , and its stock sits at April 2000 levels . Were Citigroup to trumpet loudly its efforts to improve the bottom line by jacking up ATM fees , it would be pilloried . But when an unloved Fortune 500 company turns the office into a sweatbox , it is hailed as a planetary savior . In the current Zeitgeist , green companies that do what they 're supposed to do-save money , raise profits-can earn valuable free air time that doubles as an objective third-party endorsement . And for an embattled company , going green is the ultimate conversation changer . Wal-Mart , the poster child for low wages , skimpy benefits and unfashionable merchandise , has been lauded for its no-brainer efforts to increase the mileage of its mammoth truck fleet and its decision to offer more organic foods . Google @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boeing 767 , is reaping a huge propaganda jolt from the 1.6-megawatt solar installation recently activated at its headquarters . ( Double bonus : Google uses the system to charge plug-in hybrid cars ! ) In July , McDonald 's earned a supersize portion of positive press when its U.K. unit announced it would convert 155 delivery trucks to run on biodiesel made from McNasty leftover french-fry grease . The media love these stories , in part because advertisers-who are increasingly building their brand images by associating themselves with alternative energy-love the content . As a result , many companies might be better off dispensing with high-concept advertising altogether . ( I do n't get about half those Geico caveman ads anyway . ) Forget about the focus groups and the Gucci-wearing ad hipsters . Buy a few solar panels , offset some carbon and crank out some press releases-on recycled paper , naturally . Let word slip that your CEO lunches on organic salads , and has started eating with his hands rather than using wasteful plastic utensils and paper plates . And if something really bad happens , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go carbon-neutral . Patriotism used to be the last refuge of scoundrels . Now that refuge might be environmentalism . Imagine how much better off Britney Spears would be if she had shown up at the MTV Music Video Awards in a Prius , performed in a bustier laden with light-emitting diodes and concluded by suggestively planting a tree to offset the emissions created during her disastrous show . illustration : <p>
