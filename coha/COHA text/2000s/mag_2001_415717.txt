Automotive Headnote A new car for the new president . Photograph With its tall roofline , obviously thick skin and fender-mounted flag stanchions , there 's no mistaking the president 's new limousine for any other stretched Cadillac Do Ville . If you 're still not sure , read the license plate . // On the final Monday of Bill Clinton 's presidency , the White House and the chief executive prepared for a five-day visit with an imposing visitor , one that would soon become a trusted regular in George W. Bush 's administration . No , this was not a foreign dignitary or an adviser . This was the new presidential limousine . While the car 's official public debut was the morning of Jan. 20 , when both the old and new presidents shared the back seat , Secret Service spokesman Jim Mackin said , " President Clinton got to break the car in because new White House vehicles are put into service as others are taken out . Had this car been ready to use in November , or even August , we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , government-contract tone when the carmaker announced that it secured the commission of the newest presidential limousine through a standard government bid process . Though the process of getting the job may have been mundane , the car itself is not . As you might expect of a vehicle that could be thought of as the roadbound equivalent of Air Force One , this is a very special automobile . And , though it may have started life as your uncle 's Cadillac DeVille , it 's one of a kind . Of course , given the need for maximum security , no one-from Cadillac or the Secret Service-will tell exactly how this car differs from other Cadillac DeVilles . Even basic technical details like exterior dimensions and curb weight are classified . But , Cadillac does admit that the car is equipped with such enhancements as an integrated 10-disc CD changer , a foldaway desktop and reclin- Photograph With its tall roofline , obviously thick skin and fender-mounted flag stanchions , there 's no mistaking the president 's new limousine for any other stretched Cadillac Do Ville . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // ing rear seats with massag- ing , adaptive cushions . Regardless of the secrecy surrounding the car 's specs , even the most casual observer can see that this Cadillac is a rolling fortress . Compared to previous presidential limousines , this DeVille is clearly a protective conveyance and not simply a parade vehicle . The car 's small backlite , thick A-pillars and heavily armored appearance announce its purpose . We do know that this Cadillac is less of a Caddy beneath its bulletproof skin than Air Force One is a basic Boeing 747 . Insiders at Cadillac say this limo " is a completely unique vehicle with no shared technology , design or learning passed between it and any production vehicle . " An examination of its exterior suggests that the only stock components are the headlights , taillights and wreath-and-crest emblem atop the grille . Like DeVilles at your Caddy dealership , this one has Night Vision-but the camera has been moved from its spot in the middle of the grille to an undisclosed location . And , the drivetrain behind the presidential grille is n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on what 's underneath a Cadillac Escalade , with some intense modifications . Note that even the standard DeVille 's flush-style door handles have been replaced by a loop-type design apparently borrowed from the 1992-99 generation Buick LeSabre , providing added leverage for opening the extra-thick , heavy doors and doubling as grab-handles for the Secret Service agents running alongside the car . Every inch of the limo 's metal skin is backed by military-grade armor , which offers the highest level of protection with the least weight and bulk penalty . The car 's windows  --  which do not open-are actually transparent armor . All the car 's armor is at least 5 in. thick , giving the president maximum protection in attack . The interior is also environmentally sealed to protect the occupants from chemical and airborne germ-warfare terrorism . Careful study shows that the wheel openings are larger than stock to accommodate the size of the Goodyear run-flat tires . The front fenders , which carry the flag stanchions , have small spotlights to illuminate the flags . The car 's front bumper houses foglights and special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or clear on the passenger 's side . Connected to the trunklid are five antennas . Inside , there is room for Photograph Photograph Photograph CADILLAC ONE With 5 in. worth of ballistic armor under its skin , and added height and length , the presidential limo up the scales at close to 4 tons . It 's probably based on a modified Escalade platform , riding on fun-flat tires . The dark leather interior is environmentally sealed against chemical attack . // Inside , there is room for six people to join the president , all on leather seating . Two sit up front , flanking a consolemounted communications center . In back , behind a glass partition , there are three rearfacing seats with cushions that can be folded up separately against the partition . The president and another passenger sit in the individually reclining rear seats . A folding desk separates the two rear seats , and storage compartments in the interior panels contain communications equipment . The presidential motorcade includes a special rolling communications center , so the limo need not carry as much communications equipment as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so thick , blocking out most natural light , the president gets needed light from a fluorescent halo lighting system in the headliner . And naturally , the president has his own switches for the climate-control and sound systems . After all , presidential comfort is as important as presidential security .
