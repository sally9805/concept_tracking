These facts are known : When Hurricane Katiina hit New Oileans , Mt . Cowdiey had already evacuated safely to a town in western Mississippi . A longtime iesident of the Crescent City , Mr. Cowdrey had plenty of past experience with hurricanes and always had an emergency plan . ( In fact , his previous hurricane story , " Grey Star , " appealed in our Jan. 2003 issue and is currently reprinted on our Website . ) Here 's the speculation : After Katrina , when Mr. Cowdrey returned to his home near Tulane , he found that his muse had moved in . How else to explain the suing of stories we 've received over the past two years ! SWEATING , JIM GUEST TREKKED along the street where he 'd spent most of his life . All the way , he marveled that it could be so absolutely empty . The lawns were dead , the magnolias dying . White dust covered the brown leaves , and a dry pungent reek almost like burning sulfur set him coughing . In the distance he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but here on Lark Street the vacant bungalows stood silent . Power lines hung like Christmas festoons , poles interlaced like jackstraws . A clapboard garage had floated into the roadway and lay becalmed , like an ark that had failed . The sky was a blue steel bowl , the sun blinding . With every movement an effort , Jim seemed to breast a tide of molten wax . Just beyond the garage , No. 488 came into view . Well , it was still there , not looking abandoned so much as never lived in . The big pines he 'd planted as seedlings had all blown down , but they 'd fallen away from the house instead of crushing it . Next door , Dr. Dreyfus 's house had been impaled by a boat , a pricey SeaCraft with twin outboards now suspended in midair . Both houses bore the watermark , what people were calling the bathtub ring , almost at the level of the eaves . He hated the thought of going inside 488 , seeing what had happened there - especially if Madame Lott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awaited him . Yet he 'd come a long way , and could n't turn back now . Back before Katrina - everything these days was reckoned BK or AK , as it had once been antebellum or postbellum - back in those distant times , Madame Lott had been Jim 's private oracle , consulted with a mixture of faith and irony . As a scientist - before retirement he 'd taught biology at the university - of course he knew it was all nonsense . Consulting her had been a gag at first , like sitting down with one of the Tarot readers who infested the sidewalks around Jackson Square . And a gag it seemed ( who was the " mystery woman with flame-colored hair " whose fate was entwined with his own ? ) until Madame Lott remarked that if he drank less coffee , he 'd get rid of his " migrant headaches . " How the devil did she know he had migraines ? ( And , by the way , the prescription worked . ) That first visit to her Royal Street " studio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set the pattern . She 'd opened a narrow doorway to another realm in Jim 's careful , fact-obsessed life . Sure , she faked a lot , that went with the Reader and Advisor game - intuition did n't come at anybody 's beck and call . Yet from time to time insights emerged from her purple-glossed lips that were hard to explain . About his father , for instance - the revelation that finally had convinced him there was more to her than turbans and twaddle . " I see a man with white hair , " Madame Lott had intoned . " Somebody close to you , somebody you love . He 's facing a storm . I see the flash and I hear the thunder . " Only Jim 's father qualified in the white-haired and close department . He was a cool , dim , abstract man , a bookkeeper whose frustrated yearnings for science had helped nudge Jim into the field . He 'd never really thought about loving his father until two weeks later , when he astonished himself by breaking down after learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had shot himself . Then there was the case of Dot , Jim 's wife . One day in 1997 the seeress had announced , " The woman in your bed , she carrying a dangerous baby in her womb , a baby she wo n't be able to get rid of . " Since 55-year-old Dot was in no danger of contracting motherhood , he 'd ignored this bit of fantasy until she was diagnosed with disseminated and inoperable cancer that had originated in her cervix . After her death left him stunned , dry-eyed , a man suddenly adrift and alone in a universe without meaning , he 'd asked Madame Lott to tell him about heaven and hell and God and all that . " Heaven and hell , " she 'd said , " is something you makes up . Your hell is youi hell . Your heaven is youi heaven . Sometimes you wills " em without even knowing it . " " What about God ? " " Nobody knows him , whatever they say , so do n't you try . Go read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And watch out for false comforters , the ones who deny that life is hard . Only death is easy . " Why in the world did that make him feel better - hearing that God was unknowable , death was easy , and he made his own heaven and hell ? Yet that night , as if weary of his private Hades , he wept and slept , and next day began a slow recovery from his grief . Since her days of glory , when she 'd been all three Fates rolled into one , Madame Lott had definitely gone down in the world . By the last time he 'd seen her , the week before the storm , Royal Street was a fading memory - like other marginal businesses , Madame Lott had been driven out by soaring French Quarter rents . Now she handed out advice on love , death , and ( ironically ) money in a large dingy room , formerly an agency specializing in cut-rate travel , in a strip mall on Airline Drive . Her neighbors were a remainder outlet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several boarded-up storefronts . What had been the show window was swathed in muslin drapes that created a dusty gloom . In the noontime shadows , her fat fingers had rested lightly on the backs of his pale bony hands , occasionally stroking the hairs like the strings of a zither . She was n't a pamist - she 'd explained that many times ; she touched his hands to ( why else ? ) sense his aura . That day he 'd figured his aura must be cloudy , because she hit him right off with a truly startling pronouncement : " There be dead folks in your attic . " After a moment to get over his shock , he told her , " I finished the attic years ago . Turned it into a ree room . I spend a lot of time up there . No corpses anywhere - I 'd have noticed . " He 'd felt sorry for her , overflowing her iron folding chair and handing out fake insights . When he first met her , she 'd been a handsome caf-aulait woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of merely hokey . Now she was just one more American behemoth , her huge sagging bosom overhanging the card table like an avalanche waiting to happen . On the wall , dim in the shadows , hung decaying travel posters for Aruba and Curaao and framed photos of two solemn brown babies - grandchildren , Jim supposed . He indulged a brief fantasy of Madame Lott at home , stringing up one of her bras like a hammock and rocking both children to sleep in the giant cups . And she was n't improving her reputation by filling his attic with imaginary corpses . When he told her she was wrong , the woman-mountain stirred uneasily and muttered , " Well , maybe there used to be some dead folks up there . " Oh fine , he thought . Anew tense - the Past Prophetic . " I 've lived in the house off and on since it was built , " he pointed out . " I grew up there . There 's nevei been a corpse in the attic . " She sighed deeply and tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not dead . I hear somebody gasping for breath . And now they be quiet , so quiet . " " So this happens in the future ? That does n't tell me much . The future 's even longer than the past . " " Oh no , Mr. Jim , " she said , suddenly decisive and firm . " The future ai n't long . It ai n't long at all . " And in that , as it turned out , she 'd been dead right . On a sulfurous August day , the last day he 'd seen or ever would see Lark Street as it was supposed to be , clothed in a hundred shades of green and heavy with summer scents , Jim had clipped his privet hedge and brooded about life 's monotony . Snick , snick , snick . Keep everything level . Right . Nothing ever happens in New Orleans . Dull goddamn town . Snick , snick , snick . Life had been tedious since Dot 's passing had left him alone . He was not an exciting man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " " sensible , " " means well " - in brief , a bore ) . Well , his trade had been teaching science to undergraduates ; he was n't supposed to be lively . Back when he was a student himself , he 'd dated and thought cautiously about marrying a girl named Gwen - only he thought about it so long that she married somebody else , moved to a town upstate , and for twenty years they communicated only by Christmas cards . In time he 'd relapsed into a not-too-uncomfo'rtable bachelorhood , expecting to live and die that way , perennially alone and boring . He still shook his head when he remembered the day the Dean had sent Dot to straighten out the Biology Department 's finances . ( Like Jim himself , the Accounts Payable had been scrupulously honest but muddled . ) She was slender , with suspiciously red hair and a quick , sardonic wit , in spite of which she managed to set his budget right without making him feel like an idiot . Afterward they began meeting for coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked him . But she 'd just escaped from an abusive husband and wanted a gentleman the second time around . She seemed to like his somewhat gaunt good looks , old-fashioned courtesy and quiet smile . After a brief courtship they married , and his life had never been the same . When Papa shot himself , Jim had moved back into the house in Lakeside , by then an aging subdivision of shade trees , deep greensward , and bird-named cul-de-sacs ending in small circles . He never even thought of selling it , - he 'd grown up there , learned to swim and paddle a pirogue on the Seventeenth Street canal , played inept but enthusiastic baseball in Lark Street , which had always been kid-friendly and almost without autos . The anonymous interior of the house reflected its occupation by two isolated men in succession . The only emotional focus was an oil portrait of his mother , who 'd died when he was three and existed only as a lady with wide-spaced gray eyes and a surprised expression , imprisoned eternally under glittering varnish in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under Dot the picture stayed , but the house changed . She 'd done poorly out of her first marriage but well out of her divorce , so she quit her job and they lived on his salary and spent the income from her shrewdly invested community property on improvements to their lifestyle . He 'd never been to an auction sale , but for two or three years they went every few months , buying handsome , solid furniture that Dot refinished in her spare time . Without obvious nagging , she somehow inspired him to turn the dusty attic into a ree room that became their favorite relaxing spot . Here they took it easy in elderly but still comfortable chairs , whacked a ball around a pocket billiard table if they felt athletic , otherwise read mysteries and drank their evening wine . Through a casement window they looked down at Lakeside - once part of the cypiiie , the great cypress swamp that had absorbed the river 's overflows for millennia - now , dried out by pumps and canals , an extended pine-and-magnolia grove where thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dot bought a genuine 1950s jukebox with a pile of authentic 45-rpm vinyl records and a diamond-needle Cobra tone arm , so they could listen to the music of their teen years - early Elvis from the days of " Heartbreak Hotel , " mid-course Sinatra , platters of the Platters , Al Hibbler quavering out " Unchained Melody " and Satchmo growling " Mack the Knife . " While he listened , Jim worked at an old desk - his ambition was to write a book called " Vanished Worlds " on extinct New World species like the pas " senger pigeon , Carolina parakeet , and Florida wolf - while Dot relaxed with bright heaps of seed catalogues and , increasingly , travel brochures . She became uncannily adept at squeezing the lowest rates out of airlines , finding comfortable hotels at off-season prices , saving and exploiting bonus miles . Protesting mildly all the way , Jim let her drag him to Moscow and Macchu Picchu , Shanghai and Siena . How 'd she locate that villa in Tuscany , find an affordable bug-free room for the Camivale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capuchin monks to open their boniest and most fascinating Roman grotto for the Guests , though at the time it was closed to the public ? Somehow . She was Miss Sweet Persuasion , never obviously pushing yet nearly always getting her way . When she died , all his life 's adventure went with her . Now he hardly ever left Lakeside except during Mardi Gras , when he fled the crowds to an upriver town called Bonaparte where his old girlfriend Gwen greeted him gladly . She 'd lost her husband , started a business to fill the gap , and wore a groove to Baton Rouge airport , jetting off to foist educational materials on school boards throughout the Englishspeaking world . A little of her dynamism woke him up , a lot tired him ; Gwen found his inertia first restful , then hypnotic . Come to think of it , things had been much the same back when they were dating . Now as then , they enjoyed each other best in small doses . Otherwise , he relaxed into a life built around habitual tasks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His mother 's portrait held its old place of honor , and silver-framed photos of Dot against a dozen exotic backgrounds crowded a marble mantelpiece she 'd salvaged from a defunct mansion . Exotic figures found homes in this nook and that cranny - shadow puppets from Java , plague-doctor masks from Venice , a Ch'ing statue of the Goddess of Mercy in fading reds and greens . Here he dreamed away his days , usually content though sometimes weary of the sameness of existence . Indeed , of existence itself . In dark moments he wondered how long death would take to find him . He asked Madame Lott , and her answer had been worthy of the Pythoness at Delphi . " Death will come for you too soon , " she intoned , " and too late . " " And what , " he snapped , " is that supposed to mean ? " She gave him an odd sort of smile . She 'd had some dental work , and one of her incisors was now encased in gold , with a star-shaped porthole through which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon to pass , " she explained . " Just ask anybody . And also too late , because death do n't never come in time to save you from sorrow . " Hard to argue with that now . JIM HEARD about Hurricane Katrina on the news , I but paid no attention to it until Gwen called . A storm I 1 snob , he quietly scorned nervous Nellies , convinced &gt; that anything could be ridden out if he ran the bathtub full of water and laid in an ample supply of sardines and bread . Had n't he survived three big ones and a dozen little ones in the course of his life ? But Gwen was worried , and called from Bonaparte to tell him so . " I do n't like the way it 's waltzing around the Gulf , " she said . " You . know it 's picking up energy all the time . Come on up , Jim . Beat the crowd . Besides , I want to see you , " she added . " It 's too damn prim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . " He spent another five minutes grumbling , just to make her realize he was doing it for her , not because he was scared of some damned storm . Then he packed a few clothes , and went outside to close the storm shutters . He waved languidly to his neighbors , who seemed as casual as he . Dr. Dreyfus was parking his Lexus . A lesbian couple - Jean and Carol , was it ? - who lived on the other side were walking their pugs , Bunch and Bundle . In the yard that backed on his , the Campbells " kids were enjoying their new pool as noisily as usual . He considered , then decided against emptying his fridge . How long would he be gone , after all ? He tossed his suitcase into the trunk of his car and took off . It was Saturday , August 27 , 2005 , a day in the doldrums , windless and searing . The last storm coordinates he noted before turning off and unplugging his TV made him uneasy - Katrina had finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Orleans . A Cat 3 , she was as big as Hurricane Betsy had been , back in 1965 - the strongest storm he 'd ever lived through . He wanted to ask Madame Lott about Katrina , and drove twenty miles up the Airline before cutting over to I- 10 . But her studio was closed and locked , so he slid Ella Sings Cole Poitei into his car 's CD player , turned up the air conditioning , and headed without undue haste northward toward the land of loess bluffs and kudzu infestations . Three hours later he was drinking iced tea on the long curving porch of Gwen 's neat , elderly house among the walled gardens and wisteria of Bonaparte 's Old Town . She smiled at him , a big busty woman with closecropped gray hair and a formidable Armenian nose ( her maiden name had been Sarkosian ) . " It takes a hurricane to make you come see me , " she complained , as if it were all his fault . Then she launched her conversational surfboard on a tide of gossip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Bony Part . Who was sleeping with whom . Who was sleeping with what . Juicy little scandals from a juicy little town . Some teenage kids of local bigwigs had been caught buck nekkid in a Sweet Dreams Motel with Mazla for lubrication and Ecstasy for , well , ecstasy . Jim smiled tolerantly and succumbed to a summer trance , sipping the cold tea and enjoying the hum of her voice as if he were napping near a beehive . He became aware that Gwen had fallen silent . " You have n't heard a word I said , " she accused him . " Not true . I heard everything . " " Meaning you heard but you did n't listen . In your own world as usual , dammit . What are you thinking about now ? " " Fried catfish . Good old Ictaluius fuicatus . That joint down on the river still open ? I wo n't be here long , so let 's make the most of it . " They spent the next couple of hours eating good fish and drinking bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curving Mississippi , a vast brown anaconda with countless glittering scales now touched by the setting sun . Small tugs muscled enormous barge trains upstream against " the current , and flights of small birds flashed low over the water . Above the bar a TV blared sports bulletins about local teams and updates on the hurricane nearing New Orleans . They asked a waitress to turn it down , for despite the casualness of their talk , something seemed to be happening between them - something both old and new . That night Gwen assigned him to her guest room . Then changed her mind , and just about the time he was getting sleepy , knocked at his door and joined him in bed . Nothing but snuggling happened then , but he woke before dawn ready for action and feeling strongly that he 'd better not waste his opportunity . He tickled her awake and found her agreeable . So they became lovers again , after a lapse of forty years , on the solid adult grounds of long affection and close proximity . After his unaccustomed exertion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slept long and woke late . At first he did n't know where he was . A pink sky hovered over him , yet a bedside clock said ten-twenty . Okay , the sky was actually a pink tester , and a roseate symphony of swags , ruffles , and other femstuff surrounded and enveloped him . Soft-spoken Dot had n't cared for furbelows , but pushy , domineering Gwen doted on them . Speaking of Gwen , her side of the bed was not only empty but cool . Between the double hillocks raised by his feet , Jim next contemplated a TV gazing blankly at him from a marble-topped table . He felt pretty blank himself , knowing there was something he needed to check up on , but for several minutes unable to remember what it was . Oh yeah , Katrina . He fumbled at the bedside table , found the remote and turned the set on . The first thing he saw was a satellite image of the Gulf and the two-bladed red symbol of the hurricane , now labeled Category 5 . The image was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gent with waxed and gleaming head , ordering a mandatory evacuation . Jim pulled pillows randomly behind his back to prop himself up . The damn thing was a five . Of course it 'd weaken when it hit the continental shelf - they almost always did - but back home it 'd be Betsy all over again . Roof tiles would go flying , trees would fall , the lines would go down , the power would fail . The city might take weeks to recover . Thank God his house was sound and strong , a proven veteran of many storms . Goddamn , he thought , J wish I 'd emptied that fridge . Had he brought enough clean clothes ? Would he have to sample Napoleonic fashions at Wal-Mart ? He stumbled into the bathroom , not even bothering to grimace over the pink toilet cozy , the pink tiles , the shower curtain decorated with pink bunnies and duckies . Heading down to breakfast , he found Gwen in the kitchen , the room where she actually spent her days , kissed her goodmorning , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her maid Olivia , an ebony woman of middle age who worked two hours on Sunday morning , cooked him an enormous breakfast of ham and eggs and biscuits and everything he was n't supposed to eat , and Jim pigged out because , after all , he needed to keep his strength up in these trying times . When Olivia departed to make the beds - beds because Gwen had rumpled her own , to preserve appearances - she commandeered him for church and they set forth in her Audi . Bonaparte 's Protestants worshipped in marble Greco-Roman temples , and so , paradoxically , did its handful of Jews . The priest ( genus Episcopalianus ) gave a fluent sermon on the Kingdom of Heaven , which unlike the kingdoms of the Earth operated on the pure generosity of a God whose essence was love . Then he offered a brief prayer for the people of the Gulf Coast , so soon to feel the wrath of Nature , whose ways for some reason did not mirror those of its Creator . Jim enjoyed the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From time to time Gwen turned on a wall-mounted flat-screen TV that was one of the newest gadgets in her all-purpose kitchen , and they watched repeated scenes of orating weatherpersons , the tormented Gulf , and the impacted highways leading away from it . The phone rang several times : people who ran bed-and-breakfasts were hunting rooms for new arrivals they could n't accommodate . Gwen hesitated to take in strangers , but finally accepted an NOPD cop on his honeymoon , and in due course a thick-bodied young man named Tommy Leboeuf and his new bride , Lydia - who ( Jim thought privately ) looked less like a blushing bride than a hooker from a Texarkana truckstop - showed up in a shiny new pinkchampagne-colored Cadillac . The Leboeufs went straight to bed . To make room for them , Jim moved into Gwen 's room , murmuring as he unpacked for the second time that he hoped he was n't destroying her reputation as a Christian woman . " Honey , " she replied , " desperate times require desperate measures . " That night they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the storm passing over the mouth of the Mississippi and veering eastward , back into the open Gulf , heading now for the Redneck Riviera with its white sand beaches , endless bungalows , and garish motel-and-casino strips . Jim understood that the storm 's counterclockwise winds must also be pushing the Gulf into Lake Pontchartrain , the lake into the city ; the thought kept him restless , and his unease made sleep difficult for her . Toward dawn he fell asleep at last , only to wake suddenly to the incessant rattling of window sashes . Greenish daylight filtered through the drapes , and so did the wind , setting all Gwen 's furbelows into tremulous motion . He dressed , hastened downstairs , and found her in the kitchen , sitting at the battered table where they ate , left hand pressed to her mouth , gazing at the TV screen . When Jim touched her , she took his hand without turning to look at him . " Where 's that ? " he asked , staring at a widening breach in a concrete floodwall , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or need to hear her answer . The wall guarded the Seventeenth Street Canal , less than six blocks from Lark Street . Lakeside was doomed . He muttered , " The future ai n't long at all . " That afternoon they took a siesta together , lying side by side in their underwear on Gwen 's bed . They held each other and Gwen cried for friends she 'd known , for houses where she 'd partied , for the deleted portion of her youth and memories . Jim wanted to cry , but could n't . Grief stifled him . What do you do when your life is nothing but the past , and the past is suddenly swept away ? Bonaparte had a wild night of howling wind , tossing boughs , and crashing trees . It was only the western edge of the storm , but the power went off , the air conditioning died , and Jim and Gwen retreated to the front gallery , where they sat in the tumultuous darkness , holding hands . She said more than once , " Jim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Next day the power came back on and they viewed the scope of the catastrophe in New Orleans . Television showed three-fourths of the city submerged in water , with islands of fire . Where was the President , where was the army , where was everybody ? Days slipped by like a road without mileposts as the world gazed at hunger , filth , and thirst in the Superdome , exhausted people sweltering on blinding- white freeway bridges that rose out of newborn lakes and marshes , bodies floating and swelling at familiar intersections gone unrecognizable . Looters stumbled through knee-deep water , toting stolen TVs in a city without power . On quiet Uptown streets , oaks gracefully mirrored themselves in canals where no canals were supposed to be . And Jim was so far away , so comfortable , so safe . He felt bubble-wrapped . Bonapartians gave fund- raisers for evacuees who 'd run out of money ; churches prayed for the dead and gathered food and clothing for the living . People Jim had never met stopped him on the street to ask how things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew ! Olivia hugged him and cried against his shirt and refused to take any money for the extra trouble he was giving her . He held her and for the first time cried too , not for anything he 'd lost , but for the utterly unexpected kindness of strangers . The town was full of refugees now , and they had little to do but gossip . They checked maps posted on Google and divided into castes based on how deep their houses had flooded . Jim gained some cachet at a charity jazz brunch when an Uptowner remarked that his house was high and dry on the natural levee of the Mississippi . Jim said , " Mine was on the natural levee of the Seventeenth Street Canal , " and the Uptowner retired from the field , badly worsted . Yet the Davy Jones Award did n't go to Jim . During a break when the musicians were lunching , the pianist commented en passant that his concert grand at home was under twelve feet of water . Somewhat staggered by this - what were they talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupidly saying he did n't suppose it would be worth much now . The musician replied , " Well , not as a piano , " returned to his bench , and launched into a riff , triumphant in this curious sweepstake where you won by losing . Those stories were nonfiction . There was also plenty of fiction to be heard . Tommy Leboeuf came up with new and more colorful tales at every gathering . At the jazz brunch he became the center of attention by revealing that he 'd earned a week 's leave to get married by first serving at the Superdome during the worst of times . While he was there , a predator took advantage of the darkness and disorder to rape two children , and when Tommy and his partner caught him , they threw him to the mob and watched them tear him limb from limb . " Me , I'da liked to jern in , " cept I was on duty , " he said , and all the polite folks in their ice-cream suits and summer dresses nodded agreement . Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fled the city before the storm hit , wigwagged to each other with raised eyebrows , but said nothing . Still , Gwen had had enough of her Cadillac-driving charity cases with their tall tales , and she told them they 'd have to leave . They departed while she and Jim were out to dinner , taking with them a harvest of knickknacks from the house . A couple of days later , Jim saw the cop and his lady friend on TV . They 'd been arrested in St. Louis on a warrant for a stolen Cadillac . Lydia was a hooker ( " exotic entertainer , " said the reporter ) , though from Biloxi and not Texarkana . Their stories had one real element : Tommy Leboeuf was a cop , and soon faced charges of desertion as well as grand theft , auto . Gwen said , " Well , how about that lying , thieving sonofabitch ! " But Jim said that a crooked cop made him homesick . That joke was typical of his dry humor . But an undercurrent of horror ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a staple of TV news , and every time he saw one he thought of what might be waiting for him at 488 Lark Street . He could n't shake the image of dead people sprawled out and rotting in the recreation room he and Dot had worked so hard to build out of the dusty emptiness . Who could have taken refuge there , and when and why ? Alas , there was an obvious answer . Most of his neighbors lived in one-story ranchstyles built on slabs . His attic might have been the highest spot around when the floodwall collapsed and a tsunami poured into Lakeside . Several neighbors kept keys to bis house for emergencies , as he kept keys to theirs , so getting in would n't have been a problem for old Dr. Dreyfus , the Campbells , Carol and Jean , and their little dogs , Bunch and Bundle . Was that what had happened ? Hehadno way to find out , - thelandlines were down and when he tried to call into area code 504 on Gwen 's cell phone , he roused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything was out of service . In front of the TV , he stared hypnotized at stories about desperate people trying to break out of attic prisons , images of rescuers from airboats and helicopters breaking in . Here , the searchers found only a guttered candle , a half-empty Fritos bag , a plastic water bottle . There , the remains of an old man who 'd holed up and drowned clawing at a roof he could n't break through . A black kid pointed to what had been his house and told a CBS reporter , " Mama 's up there , and she 's stuck to the floor . " By now Jim had forgotten what sound sleep meant . He woke and dozed and woke again . He wanted to go home and , at the same time , wanted never to go home . Life went on all around him , yet increasingly apart . Gwen had wasted enough time away from her business , and spent the days at her phones and her PC , lining up customers for new textbooks and multimedia gadgetry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewing such depressing sights as the overgrown and cricket-haunted Confederate cemetery , and the Catholic basilica whose many spires made him think of a crown of thorns . He ate often with strangers , devouring information about New Orleans with greater appetite than the bland , heavy food . Refugees swapped stories as they consumed burgers at Cow-Cow Boogie or munched huge , tasteless crab salads at the Plantation Kitchen . All of them except Jim carried arsenals of gadgetry that beeped and vibrated and played the opening bars of " My Blue Heaven , " and by one means or another they all seemed to have reached hundreds of contacts who were ready and willing to give eye-witness accounts of the city . So he learned that Uptown now was dry and the power back on . Bourbon Street was flourishing again , all sleaze , noise , and neon . The casinos were rushing repairs , seeing gold in a new flood , this time of construction workers pouring into town to stuff the pockets of their jeans with FEMA money . Whores were , as ever , fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plaquemines Parish was mostly under the Gulf , patrolled by pompano , redi ish , and mackerel instead of the Isleo fishermen whose ancestors had come from the Canaries centuries ago to catch them . Poor-white St. Bernard Parish had hardly a house standing . Lakeside ? Still forbidden country , daytimes roasting in the merciless sun , nighttimes dark under a sliver of new moon . One day five weeks after the storm he told Gwen , " I 've got to go back and see what 's left of my house . If anything . " She nodded . She 'd been expecting the news , had been Googling the situation too , and had already reached her own conclusions . She 'd changed her locks after the Leboeufs departed , and now gave him a set of the new keys . " You wo n't find much down there , " she warned . " I 'm flying to Albuquerque . Those people need bilingual textbooks whether they know it or not . When you come back , just let yourself in . You know where everything is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see .... Put it in the garage . We can park our cars outside for a while . " All this was brusque and businesslike , and it did n't go down at all well . Where did she get off , taking charge of his future ? After all , his life had been destroyed , not hers . All he could feel now was the sense of loss , a palpable absence like an amputee 's phantom limb . What to do about it he did n't yet know . Until he faced the bodies of his neighbors lying amid the wreckage of his home , he could n't decide . .. decide . .. decide what ? Maybe whether to bother living on . His father had faced that question once , and decided not to . When he was packed and ready to go , Gwen surprised him by embracing him passionately , then holding his head in both hands and crying against his cheek . He whispered , " I 'll be back , I 'll see you soon , " over and over . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed it . TRAFFIC ON 1-55 south was heavy but moving well , 1 a river of homebound license plates . 1-10 east was frantic , the center lanes filled with swaying empty FEMA * trailers under tow , racing to dates with the homeless . Trucks and cars filled the other lanes like rush hour on a California freeway , a traffic jam moving at 75 mph , everybody driving with the pedal to the metal , frantic for their first sight of bad news . When the city rose out of the marshes , Jim did n't see much destruction at first , just blue plastic tarps covering damaged roofs . Expecting police roadblocks in Lakeside , he turned into the Uptown . Here , instead of hysteria , an eerie quiet prevailed - the traffic sporadic , the streets clear , Chinese walls of debris piled along the curbs , huge yellow trucks and handling machines with bigger teeth than the denizens of Jurassic Park hunkering between the oaks on the wide grassy median of St. Charles Avenue . He smelled for the first time the dry stink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , carpets and wood soaked with the foul residue of departed floodwater . Yet some people were home and starting to clean up . Duct-taped refrigerators lined the streets like fat tombstones , many with spraypainted epitaphs , some political ( Cheney Inside - Do Not Open ) , some gastronomical ( Free Lunch - Maggots Only ) , some vaguely erotic ( Mr. Trashman ! Take me , I 'm yours ! ) . On doors and housefronts he saw spraypainted signs , many enigmatic like X/OB , but others perfectly clear , like U LOOT - I SHOOT . A hand-painted sign on a barricaded shop that sold Persian rugs warned : I AM INSIDE SLEEPING WITH A BIG DOG AN UGLY WOMAN TWO SHOTGUNS AND A CLAW HAMMER That made him smile , his congested spirit lightened . Suddenly he felt hungry , and began to search for food . Outside Magnum 's , a four-star restaurant whose roof had mostly blown off , he found chefs in tall white hats making hamburgers on open grills , adding to each a dollop of bleu cheese and a squirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eat a burger - Finally some food with an attitude ! - drink an icy Coke that tasted better than Mumm 's , and troll for information . Some customers had brought folding chairs , la Mardi Gras . Others lolled on green grass that had never tasted floodwater , or huddled under battered oaks and ate palms in scant spots of shade . Like all New Orleans crowds , they were noisy as a cage of toucans , - gossip had always been a popular local sport , and everybody talked to everybody , for everybody had a story to tell . A young guy wearing a T-shirt that said Thanks Katrina , That Was a Hell of a Blow Job told about meeting two girls who 'd come to town to save abandoned animals ; he offered to share his house with them and wound up living in a Noah 's Ark of dogs , cats , horses , and chickens . ( " But no nooky , " he added in an aside to Jim . " Just my luck , those ol " gals only like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so gnarled as to resemble a driftwood statue told gutturally how he 'd stayed home through the whole damn thing , the storm and the aftermath , drinking bottled water and eating MREs cadged from the army . " Vot I care about floods for , anyvay ? " he demanded . Jim talked to a young woman named Molly . Attired in shorts , bra , and flip-flops , she 'd wrestled a defunct refrigerator to the curb , then come out for food . Her freckled face shone with grease , her body with a fine sheen of perspiration . She told him he 'd have trouble entering Lakeside . The water was all gone , pumped back into the lake , but the power was still out and the army had blocked all the usual entry routes . The only people living half normally in the area were in the big houses along the lakeside ridge , where behind the green levees the ample L.A.-style dwellings of the rich and tasteless had passed through the storm almost unscathed . Then Molly had an idea . " Look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hummers are from out of town . When they stop you , show them your driver 's license and say - what street did you say you lived on ? " " Lark . " " Tell them your house is right off Lakeshore Drive and the power 's on there . They wo n't know the difference . Say you 've already been there and you left to get ice , is all . " In the end Jim 's problem , like so many , solved itself . He drove down Elysian Fields between rolling prairies of wreckage that would have done honor to a major war . When he passed Hummers , young guys in cammies waved languidly at him or simply sat , cradling their rifles and chewing gum . Nobody stopped him until the wreckage itself did . At the border of Lakeside he had to get out and walk the last mile under the dazing sun , clambering over toppled poles and trees , watched by starving dogs uncertain whether to beg him for help or eat him . And so he came back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced the front door open , stared and gasped . Then scuffed inside over stinking mud that lay caked and gray on what had been honey-colored heart-pine floors . The silver-framed pictures had vanished , maybe into the hands of looters . The furniture had floated here and there in the oddest way - a new Sony TV was standing on its head , while the dining room table had ascended the stairs about halfway before becoming stranded . Protected by its layers of varnish , his mother 's portrait in oil looked down on the ruin , astonished but unharmed . The bathtub ring was roughly at four feet . Yet the flood had initially been much higher . The tsunami had rushed down Lark Street , knocked in windows , filled the houses , then subsided to the lower level - where it sat , and sat , and sat for weeks on end . As a result , black mold made the pale walls look like monochrome Jackson Pollocks . Thirteen inches of rain had come through the roof and contributed to the ruin . In the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buzzed and unseen frogs brayed as they had in the pools of the vanished cyprire . Tiny flies hovered around the fridge amid whiffs of graveyard odor . Jim knew the creatures well ; common fruit flies , Drosophila melanogaster - he used to breed them in his lab . Getting to the second floor was tough . The table had lodged at a precarious angle , blocking his way , and he had to wrestle it loose and tip it over the banister , back into the ruin of the dining area . But at last he stood panting and streaming sweat in the upstairs hall . He touched the doorknob of the bedroom where he and Dot had slept for twenty years . Then thought : No , I do n't want to see it , and thank God she ca n't . He climbed the last flight of steps , the ones he 'd built himself when he was preparing to floor and insulate the attic , and pulled open the door at the top . Above him the suspended ceiling and the pink battens of insulation were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown rafters . The wind must have roared through here , emptying his desk , taking south all but one page of prophetically named Vanished Worlds . The pocket billiard table balanced like an acrobat on the legs of an overturned captain 's chair . One of the retired armchairs had been flung against the far wall and smashed . Yet a guitar he 'd trucked around the country back in the Sixties - his sole adventure before Dot came along - still hung from a nail in a sheltered corner , a fragile survivor of the wind 's manic attack . The jukebox stood unmoved , seemingly ready to light up in orange and purple glory . A green anole lizard basking in a dapple of sunlight on the selection keys turned its head and watched Jim with an eye like a tiny bead of black glass . So Madame Lott had been wrong . Nobody had died here . He 'd come all this way , slogging through the ruins , risking heatstroke , only to gaze on the mutilated face of everything he 'd been and done with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He leaned over and vomited ; a fist seemed to close on his chest , and for a few seconds he could n't breathe . Time compressed , then expanded , and he was out on Lark Street again . He really did n't know how he 'd gotten out of the house , and yet here he was , drifting along like any idler , watching through the swags of power lines as guys in gloves , masks , plastic coveralls , and blue hardhats came around a huge trash pile blocking the corner . Accompanied by a big brown dog , they began making their way slowly toward him across the blasted plain that once had been his part of New Orleans . He wondered whether they might take him for a looter , maybe arrest him . But they passed him by , attentive to their jobs , paying him no attention - except for the dog , a rangy mutt with bloodhound in his genes and furrows above his eyes , who sniffed warily in the vicinity of Jim 's feet until his trainer pulled the leash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through house after house , kicking in doors where they had to , trusting the dog 's educated nose as to whether they should enter or not . Afterward they spray-painted X/OB on the walls , and now he understood its meaning : House checked - no bodies . They reached 488 , and the dog began to bay . For the first time , somebody went inside . Jim watched with a tingling sense of having missed something all-important . After five minutes the searcher emerged and put in a call on a cell phone . Then the team dawdled until , with an unholy racket , a helicopter dropped out of the sky and landed with all the usual rattle and roar beside the errant garage , the prop creating its own mini-hurricane . When two " guardsmen in brown and green-spotted fatigues jumped out and carried a stainless steel gumey into his front door , Jim started forward , moving like a man breasting a strong chill current , trying to shout , and angry at the way everybody ignored him . Then the gurney reappeared , carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could do was stare . The guardsmen loaded it , jumped aboard again , and the helicopter departed in a tornado of white dust . The guy whod gone into the house spray-painted X/1B on Jim 's front door , and he and his team moved on . SO NOW HE KNEW the score . During his life people had often called him boring , but never stupid . In a dream he entered his house again , this time with singular ease , delighting in the soft glow of the honey-colored pine floor , the gleam of the silver picture frames on the mantel . The shadow puppets danced sinuously on their bamboo wands , dark eyes watched him through the Venetian masks , and the Goddess of Mercy raised two fingers in serene blessing as he passed . Upstairs the jukebox began to play " Unchained Melody , " the 1956 version that he 'd heard the first time and danced to ( clumsily , of course ) with Gwen at a high school hop . Jim ascended the stairs without effort , glancing en passant into the bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a long while , thinking that Dot must have made the bed and tidied up . The attic stairs , the open door . The recreation room was crowded - Dot leafing through a Better Homes and Gardens , Papa relaxing in one of the tattered old easy chairs , and the mother he could hardly remember gazing through the casement window at a bygone Lakeside of building sites , scattered new homes , and small thin pines . Madame Lott was there too , dandling two sleeping brown babies on her wide lap , and Jim recalled suddenly hearing her say once that she owned a house in the Ninth Ward . He tried to tell her , No , I want this but not yet , Gwen " s waiting for me , I have n't finished with life , this is too soon . She looked at him and shook her head , somehow conveying , without anything being said , that Gwen had only been an interlude , that she and he were n't made to stay together for long . Then Dot looked up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray eyes - he 'd been all of three years old when she 'd seen him last - and Papa raised his head and smiled one of his rare smiles . Home , really home at last and forever , Jim relaxed and moved with open arms toward the other inhabitants of his personal heaven .
