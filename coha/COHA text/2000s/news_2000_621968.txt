<p> When it comes to movies , everyone 's got an opinion . And when it comes to Oscars , everyone 's convinced that his or her personal favorites are eminently more deserving than the next guy 's . <p> That 's why the Academy Awards , defined as ever by politics , sentiment and studio campaigns , are so much fun to watch . For one night a year , we 're all vicarious participants in the biggest popularity contest on the globe . <p> Think of it as emotional aerobics , a purge fest . An actor you love wins the gold , and you get to whoop and stomp and feel for a minute that you did it together . The next minute , your favorite movie loses to some bloated schlock , and you rant at the TV  --  venting hostility you would n't dare exhibit in any other context . <p> I suspect we 'll have less to be angry about this time . Last year was a very strong movie year , and some outstanding films and performances are likely to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago with the " Titanic " sweep , there may be redemption when the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences hands out its 72nd annual Oscars . <p> I 'm predicting a strong showing for " American Beauty , " with wins for best picture , actor , director , original screenplay and cinematography  --  and possibly Annette Bening as best actress . But the awards will be more evenly spread this year : " The Cider House Rules , " " Topsy-Turvy , " " Boys Do n't Cry , " " The Matrix , " " Tarzan " and " Star Wars : Episode I  --  The Phantom Menace " all stand a good chance to share the spoils . <p> What follows are my predictions , not personal choices , in the top categories . I did n't see any nominees in the animated short or live-action short categories and so eliminated them from my list . <p> BEST PICTURE <p> Ever since its release in September , " American Beauty " has been the front-runner for the top Oscar . A dark , intricate drama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination of critical favorite and box-office hit . In a banner year for films , it was the top achiever and an important sign that Hollywood may be tiring of its own soggy formulas . By recognizing " Beauty " with its highest honor , the academy can reinforce that perception of a new , grown-up agenda . <p> " Beauty 's " lead has n't stopped Miramax , of course . An Oscar magnet in recent years with " The English Patient " and " Shakespeare in Love , " the company is waging a huge campaign for " The Cider House Rules , " a coming-of-age tale based on a John Irving novel . <p> If this scenario sounds familiar , it 's because DreamWorks , the studio behind " American Beauty , " was considered a shoo-in to win best picture for last year 's " Saving Private Ryan . " It lost to " Shakespeare in Love , " which left the impression that Miramax had cornered the market on winning Oscars . <p> " The Cider House Rules " barely got noticed when it was released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a warm-and-fuzzy ad campaign that ignores the film 's tragic aspects and its African American characters  --  it 's turned into a late-blooming hit . According to Las Vegas oddsmaker Lenny Del Genio , it 's running neck and neck with " American Beauty . " <p> I think " Beauty " has the edge , partly because Miramax is suffering a backlash for its aggressive campaigning , but mostly because " Beauty , " with its freshness and sophistication , promises a new direction for Hollywood entertainment . <p> The other nominees have n't a prayer . " The Insider , " Michael Mann 's expose of journalism and tobacco lobbyists , suffers the penalty of a box-office failure . Opinions on Frank Darabont 's prison fantasy " The Green Mile " are widely split between supporters and those holding their noses , and " The Sixth Sense , " the popular hit about a psychic child , is probably perceived as having won its award already , in the form of a box-office bonanza . <p> Prediction : " American Beauty . " <p> BEST ACTOR <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington , who brought dignity and passion to the flawed " The Hurricane , " and Kevin Spacey , who gave shape to all the conflicting emotions of a dropout dad in " American Beauty . " Both are great actors , and both have won previously in the supporting actor category : Washington for " Glory " ( 1989 ) , Spacey for " The Usual Suspects " ( 1995 ) . <p> But that was before Spacey forged ahead with a Screen Actors Guild award . He has " American Beauty 's " momentum behind him , as well as DreamWorks ' Oscar counterattack against Miramax . He 's also perceived as a world-class actor and may get points for his Broadway triumph last year in Eugene O'Neill 's " The Iceman Cometh . " <p> Washington could have an advantage if Oscar voters choose to honor an African American in order to assuage their guilt about the lack of minority roles , and overlook the fact that his film manipulated the truth about his character , **28;31;TOOLONG Rubin Carter . Still , I think the tide has shifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who played the whistle-blower in " The Insider " but probably will be hurt by his prima-donna reputation and his film 's poor box-office showing ; my personal choice , Richard Farnsworth , who was sublime as a gentle retiree on a spiritual pilgrimage in " The Straight Story " ; and Sean Penn as the jazz guitarist in " Sweet and Lowdown . " That 's a magnificent set of performances , but I 'm betting on Spacey . <p> Prediction : Kevin Spacey , " American Beauty . " <p> BEST ACTRESS <p> Hilary Swank won a Golden Globe and several critics ' awards for her shattering performance as Brandon Teena , the real-life Nebraska woman who masqueraded as a man and was murdered at 21 . Swank scraped the corners of her soul to play this part and was so unforgettable that it 's hard to imagine anyone having played it better . <p> Annette Bening won the Screen Actors Guild award for her role as Spacey 's slave-to-materialism wife in " American Beauty . " Sentiment could be on her side , since her husband , Warren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his achievement as a producer , on Oscar night : If Bening wins , the couple will walk home with a matched set . This is a very tight race , but I think Swank still has the edge , if only on the strength of her brave work . <p> Golden Globe winner Janet McTeer was sensational as a wayward mom in " Tumbleweeds , " but her picture was n't seen by enough people . The other candidates are dark horses : Julianne  --  Moore for her philandering Brit in the opaque " The End of the Affair " and Meryl Streep , who tied Katharine Hepburn 's record of 12 nominations , this time for playing an inner-city teacher in " Music of the Heart . " <p> Prediction : Hilary Swank , " Boys Do n't Cry . " <p> BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR <p> Tom Cruise does n't just act : He sweats , he squints , he grinds his jaw and gets that caged-man-gone-wild look in his eyes . " Magnolia , " the epic drama that cast him as a TV sex guru with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the guy was in a decathlon . <p> A lot of people are impressed by that kind of cardiovascular emoting , and Cruise , who won the Golden Globe for this role , could be Oscar-bound . He won nominations in the lead-actor category for " Born on the Fourth of July " ( 1989 ) and " Jerry Maguire " ( 1996 ) , and many in Hollywood think it 's time to validate the box-office champ . <p> But Cruise may lose votes because of " Magnolia 's " tendency to irritate a big chunk of the audience . He 's also got tough competition from Haley Joel Osment , the brilliant 11-year-old who played the psychic kid in " The Sixth Sense , " and Michael Caine , who gave a warm performance as an ether-addicted doctor in " The Cider House Rules " and won the Screen Actors Guild award for his work . Caine already has an Oscar , though , for " Hannah and Her Sisters " ( 1986 ) , and Osment has n't the body of work behind him that Cruise has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidates : Michael Clarke Duncan , the gentle giant in " The Green Mile , " and Jude Law , so dazzling as a spoiled expatriate in " The Talented Mr. Ripley . " <p> Prediction : Tom Cruise , " Magnolia . " <p> BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS <p> Here 's a category with five first-time nominees , all but one  --  Catherine Keener  --  in their 20s . Angelina Jolie may have the edge for her hell-raising mental patient in " Girl , Interrupted . " She 's a little overbearing for some tastes , but she 's got the chops and she knows how to hold the screen . There 's also a sentimental factor : If she wins , she and Jon Voight would become the first father-daughter Oscar winners since Henry and Jane Fonda . <p> Chloe Sevigny , who played the small-town object of Swank 's affection in " Boys Do n't Cry , " is probably the next strongest contender . Starting with her debut in " Kids , " she 's racked up a series of impressive performances , each one free of affectation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who gave unexpected shadings to her working-class mom in " The Sixth Sense " ; Keener , the wacky office worker of " Being John Malkovich " ; and Samantha Morton , the mute waif in " Sweet and Lowdown . " Strong performers , but I 'm betting on the formidable Jolie . <p> Prediction : Angelina Jolie , " Girl , Interrupted . " <p> BEST DIRECTOR <p> British stage director Sam Mendes made a spectacular debut with " American Beauty , " balancing humor and tragedy and drawing uni formly excellent performances from a large cast . He 's an amazing talent , and his achievement here is probably the most impressive stage-to-screen transition since Mike Nichols directed " Who 's Afraid of Virginia Woolf ? " in 1966 . <p> He also won the Directors Guild of America prize , which nearly always is matched by Oscar . <p> Wunderkind Spike Jonze delivered the year 's most original film in " Being John Malkovich , " but his film was n't nominated for best picture and it 's unlikely that a director can win without the film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Miramax machine pushing him for " The Cider House Rules , " but he was n't nominated for a Directors Guild award . The other nominees , Michael Mann for " The Insider " and M. Night Shyamalan for " The Sixth Sense , " are highly respected , but I think this is the year for Mendes and his gorgeous " Beauty .
