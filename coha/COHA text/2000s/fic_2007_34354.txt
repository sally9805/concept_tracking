Chapter One 1 . On Vikar 's shaved head is tattooed the right and left lobes of his brain . One lobe is occupied by an extreme close-up of Elizabeth Taylor and the other by Montgomery Clift , their faces barely apart , lips barely apart , in each other 's arms on a terrace , the two most beautiful people in the history of the movies , she the female version of him , and he the male version of her . 2 . This is the summer of 1969 , two days after Vikar 's twenty-fourth birthday , when everyone 's hair is long and no one shaves his head unless he 's a Buddhist monk , and no one has tattoos unless he 's a biker or in a circus . He 's been in Los Angeles an hour . He 's just gotten off a six-day bus trip from Philadelphia , riding day and night , and eating a French dip sandwich at Philippe 's a few blocks up from Olvera Street , the oldest road in the city . 3 . There in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and says , " Dig it , man . My favorite movie . " Vikar nods . " I believe it 's a very good movie . " " Love that scene at the end , man . There at the Planetarium . " Vikar stands and in one motion brings the food tray flying up , roast beef and au jus spraying the restaurant -- and brings the tray crashing down on the blasphemer across the table from him . He manages to catch the napkin floating down like a parachute , in time to wipe his mouth . Oh , mother , he thinks . " A Place in the Sun , George Stevens , " he says to the fallen man , pointing at his own head , " NOT Rebel Without a Cause , " and strides out . 4 . Tattooed under Vikar 's left eye is a red teardrop. 5 . Is it possible he 's traveled three thousand miles to the Movie Capital of the World only to find people who do n't know the difference between Montgomery Clift and James Dean , who do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few blocks north of Philippe 's , the city starts to run out and Vikar turns back . He asks a girl with straight blond hair in a diaphanous granny dress where Hollywood is . Soon he notices that all the girls in Los Angeles have straight blond hair and diaphanous granny dresses . 6 . She gives him a ride , staring at his head . She seems odd to him ; he wants her to watch the road . I believe perhaps she 's been taking illicit narcotics , he thinks to himself . " Uh , " she finally starts to say , and he can see it right there in her eyes : James Dean , Natalie Wood ... What will he do ? She 's driving and , besides , she 's a girl . You ca n't smash a girl over the head with a food tray . " Montgomery Clift , " he heads off her blunder , " Elizabeth Taylor . " " Elizabeth Taylor , " she nods . " I 've heard of her ... " pondering it a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no idea who Montgomery Clift is . " You can let me off here , " he says , and she drops him where Sunset and Hollywood Boulevards fork , at a small theater-7. - where he goes to the movies . A silent European film from the late twenties , it 's the worst print Vikar has seen-less a movie than a patchwork of celluloid-but he 's spellbound . In the late Middle Ages a young woman , identified in the credits only as " Mlle Falconetti , " is interrogated and hounded by a room of monks . The woman does n't give a performance , as such ; Vikar has never seen acting that seemed less to be acting . It 's more an inhabitation . The movie is shot completely in close-ups , including the unbearable ending , when the young woman is burned at the stake . 8 . Afterward , he makes his way farther west along Sunset before cutting up to Hollywood Boulevard . Where once was the Moulin Rouge nightclub at the corner of Vine is now a psychedelic club called the Kaleidoscope . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Along Hollywood Boulevard are shabby old jewelry shops , used bookstores , souvenir stands , porn theaters . He 's startled there are no movie stars walking down the street . Still hungry from having sacrificed his French dip sandwich at Philippe 's , he orders a chicken pot pie at Musso &; Frank , where Billy Wilder used to lunch with Raymond Chandler while they were writing Double Indemnity , both drinking heavily because they could n't stand each other . 9 . He spends a few minutes looking at the footprints outside the Chinese Theatre . He can find neither Elizabeth Taylor nor Montgomery Clift . At the box office he buys a ticket and goes inside to watch the movie . As Vikar traveled on what seemed an endless bus to Hollywood , the Traveler hurtles through space toward infinity . Dimensions fall away from the Traveler faster and faster until , by the end of the movie , he 's an old man in a white room where a black monolith appears to him at the moment of death . He becomes an embryonic , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind of starchild as well , a product of no parentage he acknowledges , vestiges of an earlier childhood falling away from him like dimensions . Vikar tells himself , I 've found a place where God does not kill children but is a Child Himself . He 's now seen two movies , one of the Middle Ages and one of the future , in his first seven hours in Los Angeles . Vikar crosses Hollywood Boulevard to the Roosevelt Hotel , built by Louis B. Mayer , Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford in the year the movies discovered sound . 10 . Vikar walks through the Roosevelt lobby , which has a statue of Charlie Chaplin . With its stone arches and palm fronds , it 's slightly seedy ; the first Academy Awards were held here forty years before . At the front desk , he asks for room 928 . The young clerk behind the front desk says , " That room 's not available . " His long hair is tucked into his collar beneath his coat and tie . " Are you certain ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Vikar says , " Montgomery Clift lived in that room . " " Who ? " Vikar restrains the urge to pick up the small bell from the desk and lodge it in the philistine 's forehead . For a moment he considers the image of the clerk having a bell for a third eye , like a cyclops . People could walk up and ring it , and every time they did , this infidel would remember Montgomery Clift . " Montgomery Clift , " Vikar says , " lived here after making A Place in the Sun , when he was filming From Here to Eternity . " 11 . The clerk says , " Hey , man , have you seen Easy Rider ? I usually do n't go to movies . I 'm into the Music . " " What ? " " The Music . " The clerk turns up the radio . There 's a song playing about a train to Marrakesh : " All aboard the train , " the singer sings . It 's horrible ; they 've forgotten A Place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something narcotics-related about the song . " Montgomery Clift 's ghost lives in this hotel , " Vikar says . " No , " the clerk answers , " that 's that D.W. guy . " " D.W. ? " " It 's in the brochure . He died here or something , busted . " He adds , " I do n't mean busted like by the cops-I mean broke . His ghost rides up and down the elevators trying to figure out where to go . " " D.W. Griffith ? " " I think that 's him , " the clerk nods , impressed , " yeah , D. W. Griffin . " He looks at the register . " Room 939 is available , that 's in the other corner at the other end of the hall , so it 's like Room 928 except backward . " " All right . " " By now , " the clerk shrugs , " they may have changed around all the numbers anyway . " " The ninth floor is probably still the ninth floor , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yeah , " he allows , a sense of revelation sweeping over him , " the ninth floor is probably still the ninth floor . " In the register Vikar signs Ike Jerome , which is not an alias . No one , including himself , calls him Vikar yet . He pays cash ; the clerk gives him the key and Vikar heads to the elevator . " That was heavy , man , " the clerk calls after him , " that thing about the ninth floor . " 12 . When Vikar steps in the elevator and pushes the button for the ninth floor , one by one all of the other floors light up too . At each floor , the door slides open . Vikar feels someone brushing past him , leaning out and peering just long enough to determine it 's the wrong floor , before continuing on to the next . 13 . Vikar ca n't see the Chinese Theatre from the window of room 939 , but he can see the Hollywood Hills and the Magic Castle above Franklin Avenue . Houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rounded like space ships . Leaning far to the right and staring west toward Laurel Canyon Vikar could also see , if he looked for it , the speck of the house that he 'll live in nine years from now . The morning after his first night in the Roosevelt , he walks down the hallway and finds , as the clerk advised , room 928 at the other end , and peers in as the maid makes it up . From its window overlooking Orange Street , Montgomery Clift could n't see the Chinese Theatre either . 14 . That first night in the Roosevelt , Vikar has the same dream he always has after every movie he sees , the same dream he 's had since the first movie he ever saw . In his dream there 's a horizontal-shaped rock and someone lying on the rock very still . The side of the rock seems to open , beckoning to Vikar , like a door or chasm. 15 . Vikar stays at the Roosevelt three nights . When he checks out , he asks the clerk where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orange . " When you get to Sunset , " he says , " see if you can hitch a ride west . " He motions with his thumb . " That will be to your right , man . " " I know which direction is west . " " That 's where the Music is . " " Thank you , " Vikar says , leaving quickly , still inclined to lodge the desk bell in the clerk 's head . 16 . He sees phosphorescent cars and vans painted with cinemascopic women with stars in their hair and legs apart and the cosmos coming out of the center of them , bearing travelers and starchildren . At Crescent Heights , Sunset winds down into the Strip 's gorge , and Vikar stands as if at the mouth of wonderland , gazing at Schwab 's Drugstore .... ... he knows the story about Lana Turner being discovered there is n't true , but he also knows that Harold Arlen wrote " Over the Rainbow " there and that F. Scott Fitzgerald had a heart attack there . Vikar is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived somewhere around the block . Actually , he 's unclear about F. Scott Fitzgerald , beyond the fact he was a writer whose work included The Women , starring Joan Crawford , although he did n't get a screen credit . 17 . Across the street , on an island in the middle of the intersection , is a club called the Peppermint Lounge . Another kid with long hair points Vikar north , up the boulevard into the canyon . " Check it out , " he advises , staring at Vikar 's head , " about half way up you 'll come on this old fucked-up house where people crash . " The hippie adds , in a manner at once conspiratorial and breezy , " Lots of chicks up there who do n't wear anything , man . " 18 . An hour later , halfway up Laurel Canyon Boulevard , grand stone steps swirl into the trees , to a ruin a little like Gloria Swanson 's mansion in Sunset Boulevard . William Holden 's role in Sunset Boulevard was written for Montgomery Clift , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a younger man kept by an older actress was too much like him ; at the time Clift was seeing an older actress , one of the rare romantic relationships with a woman he had . Someone at the country store in the belly of the canyon tells Vikar the house is where Harry Houdini lived while trying to become a movie star in the twenties , making movies with titles like The Man From Beyond , Terror Island , The Grim ... The Grim ... The Grim what ... ? 19 . The only chick Vikar finds who does n't wear anything is three years old . Standing in the clearing of what was once the house 's great living room , she has dark curls and a preternatural gaze . She looks at Vikar , the pictures of the man and woman on his head , the tattooed teardrop beneath his left eye . She 's undecided whether to laugh or cry . A paternal distress at the vulnerability of the little girl standing alone before him sweeps through Vikar , and he feels a surge of rage at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes the man and girl study each other there under the cover of the canyon 's trees . " Zazi. " 20 . Vikar turns to look over his shoulder at the voice behind him . The most beautiful woman he 's ever seen off a movie screen calls to the little girl . With long auburn hair and a tiny perfect cleft in her chin , in the same gossamer dress that all of the young women in Los Angeles wear , she smiles at the tattooed man a cool , almost otherworldly smile he 's never seen , its source a secret amusement . At the same time , he 's relieved to sense in the woman the same concern for the girl 's safety that he feels . The woman 's eyes lock his ; he smiles back . But she 's not smiling at him , rather she 's smiling at her power to enchant him-and it 's like a stab to his heart for him to realize that he is the reason for her concern , that she would believe for a moment he could hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his and she softly says the girl 's name again , it 's as if trying not to provoke a wild animal only feet away . " Zazi . " This time the young woman glides slowly to the middle of the ruins to take her daughter and back away from Vikar slowly , clutching the girl to her . Neither the woman nor the girl takes her eyes off him . The woman looks at Vikar a moment longer as if to make certain the spell will hold long enough to get the girl to safety . Then she turns and carries the child across the boulevard to a house on the opposite corner , the small girl watching Vikar over her mother 's shoulder . 21 . Like the wild animal the woman believed he was , Vikar stalks the grounds of the Houdini House in the dark , pounding on the walls , trying to remember . The Grim ... ? Houdini was related to one of the Three Stooges by marriage . I 'll bet I 'm the only one in this Heretic City who knows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has secret passages leading to all parts of the canyon , although he never finds one . The house across the boulevard on the corner , where the young woman took her daughter , once belonged to Tom Mix . Now it 's occupied by an extended family of hippies led by a musician with a Groucho Marx mustache . Hippies and musicians everywhere ... 23. ... but something has happened , it 's become a ghost canyon . Above the ruins of the house , Vikar sees caves in the hillside . A fire burns in one and he makes his way to it , climbing through the trees . The cave has two entrances , forming a small tunnel . Inside the cave , a young couple huddles around the fire . 24 . Vikar stands in the mouth of the cave . The young man and woman look at Vikar , at his bald illustrated dome , and spring from the fire lurching for the cave 's other opening . Vikar watches them run off the hillside into the night air , then plummet the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house below . (
