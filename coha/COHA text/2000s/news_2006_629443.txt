<p> AS Tony Emanuel rolled gray paint over a graffiti-tagged Montrose resale shop , a dreadlocked and tattooed observer could n't resist the urge to tell the city employee he was defacing a celebrated art form . <p> " I 'd prefer to see writing on the wall than to have a gray city , man , " said Rick Pierceall , 35 , a local tattoo artist . <p> " Would you like someone to walk into your house and paint it with graffiti ? " retorted Emanuel , an inspector for the Neighborhood Protection Corps . <p> " No ... but nobody tagged inside this business , man , " Pierceall said , adding that he has never vandalized property with graffiti . <p> " Outside , inside , top side , any side - it do n't belong here , " Emanuel replied , effectively ending the argument . " No one had permission to tag up this building . " <p> Since taking over graffiti-abatement duties last month , Neighborhood Protection has aggressively tackled graffiti by covering it with the gray paint that city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering other strategies , such as chemical sprays , but " snot " remains Houston 's primary weapon in the war against graffiti . <p> " My goal is to show ( the vandals ) there 's only one gang in town - Neighborhood Protection - and we tag in gray , " said Houston Police Department Assistant Chief Brian Lumpkin , head of Neighborhood Protection . <p> Investigating complaints <p> The program , formerly under the mayor 's Anti-Gang Office , now uses city inspectors to monitor graffiti complaints reported to 911 and the 311 help line . Hate speech and high-profile graffiti are painted over first by county probationers and jail trusties working off community service hours . <p> Officer John Eixman , graffiti-abatement coordinator , is investigating more than 1,200 graffiti complaints . <p> " We do n't want to be a citywide paint-over service , " Eixman said . " We want owners to take care of property , but we understand they 're the victim . " <p> City ordinance requires property owners to remove graffiti within 30 days of receiving a city notice . Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiver for the city to paint over it . If they do n't sign the waiver or address graffiti in a timely manner , the city can place a lien on the property . <p> Patricia Harrington , Anti-Gang Office director , said her office did not have the resources to address all graffiti complaints . <p> " It 's a better fit for Neighborhood Protection because they have more staff and resources , " she said , adding that only a small part of graffiti in Houston is related to gangs . <p> The rest of the graffiti is spray-painted or scrawled in marker or chemicals by vandals who seek to deface property with crude messages or nicknames . Other vandals consider themselves artists because they " bomb " ornate " pieces " on abandoned buildings , rail cars or drainage ditches . <p> " The whole purpose of putting a name up somewhere is to maximize high visibility , " said GONZO247 , a longtime Houston graffiti artist whose Aerosol Warfare artist collective promotes legal graffiti art on canvas . <p> Better than nothing ' <p> Kelly DeHay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graffiti , had noticed a spike in graffiti around town . DeHay applauds the city 's latest efforts but thinks the gray paint is an ineffective deterrent that 's becoming its own eyesore . <p> " Gray paint is better than nothing ; however , in the Montrose area we have a lot of businesses that are bright colors , " he said . " It just looks odd to have a red or green building that 's partially covered in gray paint . " <p> On a recent tour of Montrose , Emanuel pointed out graffiti on structures the city had repeatedly covered in gray . The owner of the resale shop , a red building , that Emanuel painted recently said the city had covered it at least 10 times last year only to see fresh tags follow each new coat of paint . <p> " We keep this up , the whole city will be gray , " Emanuel joked while rolling yet another layer of paint over tagged telephone poles , utility boxes and pay phones . " But we have to keep doing this to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint may not be the city 's only weapon , however . Last week , Eixman watched a vendor demonstrate a chemical spray that dissolves graffiti . The city is considering using the process . <p> Cameras suggested <p> DeHay and the resale-shop owner , who declined to give his name for fear of retaliation , think the city would be more effective if it also conducted undercover investigations . DeHay thinks it could start by installing cameras in habitually tagged locations . <p> " I know we ca n't put a policeman on every corner , but it just seems like these kids wo n't stop until they get caught , " he said . <p> Undercover operations take time and manpower that the understaffed Police Department does n't have , Lumpkin said . In the meantime , he encouraged business owners to install their own video cameras . <p> Many people interviewed , including taggers , say the gray paint only affirms certain locations as tagging hot spots . <p> " In reality , no one is going to get rid of the city 's graffiti , period , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " fellujah " wrote in response to questions a Houston Chronicle reporter posted on a Houston graffiti Internet board . " It has been going on for years now and it is only growing . As far as using the gray buff , it is only a new canvas being set . " <p> Lumpkin said the paint is a short-term solution to help the city get caught up on covering as much graffiti - some tags are up to five years old - as possible . On a recent weekend , a group of Harris County probationers covered graffiti along the Southwest Freeway with 17 gallons of paint . <p> " We 'll keep painting over graffiti until , hopefully , taggers get discouraged " or they grow out of their destructive phase , he said . <p> Lumpkin said the strategy is effective in other areas . The East End has seen a decrease in graffiti since residents there have taken it upon themselves to repeatedly cover it . <p> Harrington of the Anti-Gang Office added that the city can not stop graffiti , but it can control the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " I 've driven by lots with huge trash dumps . Solid waste picks them up , and the next day you have another pile . You just have to stay on it and control it as best you can . " <p> Prosecuting taggers <p> Police have successfully prosecuted taggers . In 2003 , two young men were arrested and charged with felony graffiti after an off-duty police officer saw one of them spray-painting " Rebs " on a highway exit sign along Texas 288 . <p> Keith Thomas Hayes , 23 , of Magnolia , and Adam Russell Berry , 26 , of Dayton , both pleaded guilty to felony graffiti charges . Each was sentenced to six years of probation . <p> Hayes declined to comment , and Berry could not be reached . <p> " These guys consider themselves artists in the ( Jean-Michel ) Basquiat vein , " said Neal Davis , Hayes ' defense attorney . " They 're not people who are out there just defacing government property for no reason . " <p> Their vandalism cost the Texas Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs . <p> GONZO247 thinks most of Houston 's taggers are thrill-seeking suburban youths . <p> " It 's not little ghetto kids doing it nowadays , " he said . " It 's rich suburban kids . They 're getting spray paint and terrorizing the town . " <p> Records show Hayes lives in his family 's Montgomery County home - appraised at $305,500 - in a subdivision where homes sit on 2- to 3-acre lots . <p> Pierceall , the tattooed graffiti enthusiast , said Houstonians can look to the " Basquiat " exhibit at the Museum of Fine Arts , Houston to see that graffiti has become a viable art form . <p> The exhibit , however , includes the artist 's graffiti-inspired works painted on canvas , said MFAH director Peter Marzio . Jean-Michel Basquiat was a middle-class Brooklyn youth who tagged " SAMO " on New York 's subways in the late 1970s before becoming a famous artist . <p> " There are lots of people who are frustrated and want , for one reason or another , to assert their individuality or power or authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to violate other people 's rights by spray-painting on someone 's property , " Marzio said . " In that sense , it 's interesting . It 's just too bad it 's illegal . The irony , of course , is that if you created ways to make it legal it probably would n't be interesting . That 's the edge , the irony . " <p> NOTES : robert.crowe@chron.com 1-3 . AARON M. SPRECHER PHOTOS : FOR THE CHRONICLE @x YOU ASKED , SHE ANSWERED !
