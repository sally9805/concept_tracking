Because hard sf is so hard to write well , most of its best practitioners are branded as hard sf writers regardless of what else they publish . ( When was the last time you heard someone refer to " the poet Joe Haldeman " or " the fantasist Greg Bear " ? ) Paul McAuley 's most recent novel , The Secret of Life , is definitely hard sf , but his previous three novels-the Confluence trilogy-were planetary romances in the vein of Gene Wolfe and Jack Vance . And his latest story for us is a work of alternate history , one that will have people referring to " the ingenious Paul McAuley . " <p> PHIL IS FLYING . HE IS IN the air , and he is flying . His head full of paranoia blues , the Fear beating around him like black wings as he is borne above America . The revelation came to him that morning . He can time it exactly : 0948 , March 20 , 1974 . He was doing his program of exercises as recommended by his personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little gym he 'd had made from the fifth bedroom . And in the middle of his second set of situps something goes off in his head . A terrifically bright soundless explosion of clear white light . He 's been having flashes - phosphene afterimages , blank moments of calm in his day - for about a month now , but this is the spiritual equivalent of a hydrogen bomb . His first thought is that it is a stroke . That his high blood pressure has finally killed him . But apart from a mild headache he feels perfectly fine . More than fine , in fact . Alert and fully awake and filled with a great calm . It 's as if something took control of me a long time ago , he thinks . As if something put the real me to sleep and allowed a constructed personality to carry on my life , and now , suddenly , I 'm fully awake again . The orthomolecular vitamin diet , perhaps that did it , perhaps it really did heighten synchronous firing of the two hemispheres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm ready to put everything in order . And without any help , he thinks . Without Emmet or Mike . That 's important . By this time he is standing at the tall window , looking down at the manicured lawn that runs out from the terrace to the shaggy hedge of flowering bougainvillaea , the twisty shapes of the cypresses . The Los Angeles sky pure and blue , washed clean by that night 's rain , slashed by three white contrails to make a leaning A. A for affirmation , perhaps . Or A for act . The first thing , he thinks , because he thinks about it every two or three hours , because it has enraged him ever since Emmet told him about it , the very first thing I have to do is deal with the people who stole my book . A week ago , perhaps inspired by a precursor of the clear white flash , Phil tried to get hold of a narcotics agent badge , and after a long chain of phone calls managed to get through to John Finlator , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight to the top . And he 'd been right , Phil thinks now . If I want a fed badge , I have to get it from the Man . Get sworn in or whatever . Initiated . Then deal with the book pirates and those thought criminals in the SFWA , show them what happens when you steal a real writer 's book . It all seemed so simple in the afterglow of revelation , but Phil begins to have his first misgivings less than an hour later , in the taxi to LAX . Not about the feeling of clarity and the sudden energy it has given him , but about whether he is making the best use of it . There are things he 's forgotten , like unformed words on the tip of his tongue . Things he needs to deal with , but he ca n't remember what they are . He is still worrying at this , waiting in line at the check-in desk , when this bum appears right in front of him , and thrusts what seems like an unraveling baseball under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pirated novel : Phil 's simmering anger reignites , and burns away every doubt . It is a cheap paperback printed by some backstreet outfit in South Korea , the thin absorbent paper grainy with wood specks , a smudged picture of a castle silhouetted against the Japanese flag on the cover , his name far bigger than the title . Someone stole a copy of Phil 's manuscript , the one he agreed to shelve , the one his publishers paid handsomely not to publish in one of those tricky deals Emmet is so good at . And some crook , it still is n't completely clear who , published this cheap completely illegal edition . Emmet told Phil about it a month ago , and Phil 's publishers moved swiftly to get an injunction against its sale anywhere in the USA . But thousands of copies are in circulation anyway , smuggled into the country and sold clandestinely . And the SFWA , Phil thinks , the Science Fiction Writers of America , Emmet is so right about them , the Swine Fucking Whores of Amerika , they may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edition , but their bleatings about censorship and their insidious promotion of this blatant violation of my copyright proves they want to drag me down to their level . Me : the greatest living American novelist . Erich Segal called me that only last month in a piece in The New York Review of Books ; Updike joshed me about it during the round of golf we played the day after I gave that speech at Harvard . The greatest living American novelist : of course the SFWA want to claim me for their own propaganda purposes , to pump my life 's blood into their dying little genre . And now this creature has materialized before Phil , like some early version or failed species of human being , with blond hair tangled over his shoulders , a handlebar mustache , dressed in a buckskin jacket and faded blue jeans like Hollywood 's idea of an Indian scout , a guitar slung over his shoulder , fraying black sneakers , or no , those were his feet , bare feet so filthy they looked like busted shoes . And smelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this indigent , his hand thrust toward Phil , and a copy of the stolen novel in that hand , as he says , " I love this book , man . It tells it like it is . The little men , man , that 's who count , right ? Little men , man , like you and me . So could you like sign this for me if it 's no hassle .... " And Phil is seized by righteous anger and great wrath , and he smites his enemy right there , by the American Airlines First Class check-in desk . Or at least he grabs the book and tears it in half - the broken spine yielding easily , almost gratefully - and tells the bum to fuck off . Oh , just imagine the scene , the bum whining about his book , his property , and Phil telling the creature he does n't deserve to read any of his books , he is banned for life from reading his books , and two security guards coming and hustling the bum away amid apologies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly . He screams and struggles , yells that he , Phil , is a fake , a sell-out , man , the guitar clanging and chirping like a mocking grasshopper as he is wrestled away between the two burly , beetling guards . Phil has to take a couple of Ritalin pills to calm down . To calm his blood down . Then a couple of uppers so he can face the journey . He still has the book . Tom in half , pages frazzled by reading and rereading slipping out of it every time he opens it , so that he has to spend some considerable time sorting them into some kind of order , like a conjuror gripped by , stage flop sweat in the middle of a card trick , before he can even contemplate looking at it . Emmet said it all . What kind of commie fag organization would try to blast Phil 's reputation with this cheap shot fired under radar ? Circulating it on the campuses of America , poisoning the young minds who should be drinking deep clear drafts of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Man in the High Castle . A story about an author locked in the castle of his reputation , a thinly disguised parable about his own situation , set in a parallel or alternate history where the U.S.A. lost the war and was split into two , the East governed by the Nazis , the West by the Japanese . A trifle , a silly fantasy . What had he been thinking when he wrote it ? Emmet was furious when Phil sent him the manuscript . He wasted no words in telling Phil how badly he had fucked up , asking him bluntly , what the hell did he think he was doing , wasting his time with this lame sci-fi crap ? Phil had been stuck , that 's what . And he 's still stuck . Ten , fifteen years of writing and rewriting , two marriages made and broken while Phil works on and on at the same book , moving farther and farther away from his original idea , so far out now he thinks he might never get back . The monster does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brilliant New . The Great Unfinished . Whatever . And in the midst of this mire , Phil set aside the Next Great Novel and pulled a dusty idea from his files - dating back to 1961 , for Chrissake - and something clicked . He wrote it straight out , a return to the old days of churning out sci-fi stories for tiny amounts of money while righteously high on speed : cranked up , cranking out the pages . For a little while he was so happy : just the idea of finishing something made him happy . But Emmet made him see the error of his ways . Made him see that you ca n't go back and start over . Made him see the depth of his error , the terrible waste of his energy and his talent . That was when Phil , prompted by a research paper he discovered , started on a high protein/low carbohydrate diet , started dosing himself with high levels of water soluble vitamins . And then the pirated edition of The Man in the High Castle appeared , and Emmet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in Phil a fine hot sweat of shame and fury . Phil puts the thing back in his coat pocket . Leans back in his leather  --  upholstered First Class seat . Sips his silvery martini . The anger is still burning inside him . For the moment he has forgotten his doubts . Straight to the top , that 's the only answer . Straight to the President . After a while , he buzzes the stewardess and gets some writing paper . Takes out his gold-nibbed , platinum-cased Cross fountain pen , the pen his publishers gave him to mark the publication of the ten millionth copy of the ground-breaking , genre-busting The Grasshopper Lies Heavy . Starts to write : Dear Mr President : I would like to introduce myself . I am Philip K. Dick and admire and have great respect for your office . I talked to Deputy Narcotics Director Finlator last week and expressed my concern for our country .... THINGS GO smoothly , as if the light has opened some kind of path , as if it has tuned Phil 's brain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flies to Washington , D. C. and immediately hires a car , a clean light blue Chrysler with less than a thousand miles on the clock , and drives straight to the White House . Because there is no point in posting the letter . That would take days , and it might never reach the President . All Phil would get back would be a photograph signed by one of the autograph machines that whir ceaselessly in some White House basement .... No , the thing to do is subvert the chain of command , the established order . So Phil drives to the White House : to the White House gate . Where he gives the letter to one of the immaculately turned out Marine guards . Because of an act of wanton piracy , Sir , the young people , the Black Panthers etc etc do not consider me their enemy or as they call it The Establishment . Which I call America . Which I love . Sir , I can and will be of any Service that I can to help the country out . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brainwashing Techniques .... Phil walking up to the White House gates in the damp Much chill , handing the letter , written on American Airlines notepaper and sealed in an American Airlines envelope , to the Marine . While still buzzing from the uppers he dropped in the LAX washroom . And driving away to find the hotel he 's booked himself into . Everything going down smoothly . Checking in . Washing up in his room . Wondering if he should use the room menu or find a restaurant , when the phone rings . It 's his agent . Emmet is downstairs in the lobby . Emmet wants to know what the hell he 's up to . And suddenly Phil is struck by another flash of light , igniting at the center of his panic , and by the terrible thought that he is on the wrong path . Phil 's agent , Anthony Emmet , is smart and ferocious and tremendously ambitious . A plausible and worldly guy who , as he likes to put it , found Phil under a stone one day in the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories for a living and trying to write straight novels no one wanted to publish . Emmet befriended Phil , guided him , mentored him , argued with him endlessly . Because ( he said ) he knew Phil had it in him to be huge if he would only quit puttering around with the sci-fi shit . He persuaded Phil to terminate his relationship with the Scott Meredith Agency , immediately sold Phil 's long mainstream novel Voices from the Street to a new publishing outfit , Dynmart , guided Phil through endless rewrites . And Voices , the odyssey of a young man who tries to escape an unfulfilling job and a failing marriage , who is seduced by socialists , fascists , and hucksters , but at last finds redemption by returning to the life he once scorned , made it big : it sold over two hundred thousand copies in hardback , won the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award , was made into a movie starring Leslie Caron and George Peppard . But the long struggle with Voices blocked or jammed something in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel about interned Japanese in the Second World War , The Grasshopper Lies Heavy , which received respectful but baffled reviews ; a slim novella , Earthshaker , cannibalized from an old unpublished novel . And then stalled silence , Phil paralyzed by the weight of his reputation while his slim oeuvre continued to multiply out there in the world , yielding unexpected translations in Basque and Turkish , the proceedings of a symposium on the work of Philip K. Dick and Upton Sinclair , an Australian mini-series which blithely transposed the interned Japanese of The Grasshopper Lies Heavy into plucky colonial prisoners of war . Phil has n't seen his agent for ten years . It seems to him that Emmet still looks as implausibly young as he did the day they first met , his skin smooth and taut and flawless , as if made of some material superior to ordinary human skin , his keen black eyes glittering with intelligence , his black hair swept back , his black silk suit and white silk shirt sharp , immaculate , his skinny black silk tie knotted just so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitman ; he looks right at home in the plush , candlelit red leather booth of the hotel bar , nursing a tall glass of seltzer and trying to understand why Phil wants to see the President . " I 'm on the case about the piracy , " Emmet tells Phil . " There 's absolutely nothing to worry about . I 'm going to make this - " he touches the frazzled book on the table with a minatory forefinger - " go away . Just like I made that short story collection Berkley wanted to put out go away . I have people on this day and night , " Emmet says , with a glint of dark menace . " The morons responsible for this outrage are going to be very sorry . Believe me . " " I thought it was about the book , " Phil says . He 's sweating heavily ; the red leather booth is as snug and hot as a glove , or a cocoon . " But now I 'm not sure - " " You 're agitated , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this would unbalance anyone . And you 've been self-medicating again . Ritalin , those huge doses of vitamins .... " " There 's nothing wrong with the vitamins , " Phil says . " I got the dosages from Psychology Today . " " In a paper about treating a kid with schizophrenic visions , " Emmet says . " I know all about it . No wonder you 're agitated . Last week , I understand , you called the police and asked to be arrested because you were , what was it ? A machine with bad thoughts . " Phil is dismayed about the completeness of Emmet 's information . He says , " I suppose Mike told you about that . " Mike is Phil 's driver and handyman , installed in a spartan little apartment over Phil 's three-door garage . Emmet says , " Of course Mike told me that . He and I , we have your interests at heart . You have to trust us , Phil . You left without even telling Mike where you were going . It would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just happen to be in Washington on business . " " I do n't need any help , " Phil tells Emmet . " I know exactly what I 'm doing . " But he 's not so sure now that he does . When the light hit him he knew with absolute certainty that something was wrong with his life . That he had to do something about it . He fixed on the first thing that had come into his head , but now he wonders again if it is the right thing . Maybe , he thinks unhappily , I 'm going deeper into what 's wrong . Maybe I 'm moving in the wrong direction , chasing the wrong enemy . Emmet , his psychic antennae uncannily sensitive , picks up on this . He says , " You know exactly what to do ? My God , I 'm glad one of us does , because we need every bit of help to get you out of this mess . Now what 's this about a letter ? " Phil explains with great reluctance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it 's containable . " " I thought that if I got a badge , I could get things done , " Phil says . The martini he 's drinking now is mixing strangely with the martinis he drank in the air , with the speed and Ritalin he took in LAX , the speed he took just now in his hotel bedroom . He feels a reckless momentum , feels as if he 's flying right there in the snug , hot booth . " You 've got to calm down , Phil , " Emmet says . Candlelight glitters in his dark eyes as he leans forward . They look like exquisite gems , Phil thinks , cut with a million microscopic facets . Emmet says , " You 're coming up to fifty , and you are n't out of your mid-life crisis yet . You 're thrashing around , trying this , trying that , when you just have to put your trust in me . And you really should n't be mixing Ritalin and Methedrin , you know that 's countraindicated . " Phil does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth . He says , " It 's as if I 've woken up . As if I 've been dreaming my life , and now I 've woken up and discovered that none of it was real . As if a veil , what the Greeks call dokos , the veil between me and reality has been swept away . Everything connects , Emmet , " Phil says , picking up the book and waving it in his agent 's face . Loose pages slip out , flutter to the table or to the floor . " You know why I have this book ? I took it from some bum who came up to me in the airport . Call that coincidence ? " " I 'd say it was odd that he gave you the copy I gave you , " Emmet says . " The agency stamp is right there on the inside of the cover . " As Phil stares at the purple mark , he adds , " You 're stressed out , Phil , and that weird diet of yours has made things worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't need to do anything except leave it all to me . If you 're honest , is n't this all a complicated ploy to distract yourself from your real work ? You should go back to L.A. tonight , there 's a Red Eye that leaves in two and a half hours . Go back to L.A. and go back to work . Leave everything else to me . " While he talks , Emmet 's darkly glittering gaze transfixes Phil like an entomologist 's pin , and Phil feels that he is shriveling in the warm darkness , while around him the noise of conversation and the chink of glasses and the tinkle of the piano increases , merging into a horrid chittering buzz . " I hate this kind of jazz , " Phil says feebly . " It 's so goddamn fake , all those ornate trills and runs that do n't actually add up to anything . It 's like , at LAX , the soupy strings they play there . " " It 's just background music , Phil . It calms people . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pops it in his mouth and chews , his jaw moving from side to side . " Calms people . Yeah , that 's absolutely right . It deadens them , Emmet . Turns them into fakes , into inauthentic people . It 's all over airwaves now , there 's nothing left but elevator music . And as for TV .... It 's the corporations , Emmet , they have it down to a science . See , if you pacify people , take away all the jagged edges , all the individualism , the stuff that makes us human - what have you got ? You have androids , docile machines . All the kids want to do now is get a good college degree , get a good job , earn money . There 's no spark in them , no adventure , no curiosity , no rebellion , and that 's just how the corporations like it . Everything predictable because it 's good for business , everyone hypnotized . A nation of perfect , passive consumers . " Emmet says , " Is that part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do need to get you on that Red Eye . Away from this nonsense , before any real damage is done . Back to your routine . Back to your work . " " This is more important , Emmet . I really do feel as if I 'm awake for the first time in years . " A man approaches their booth , a tall overweight man in a shiny gray suit and cowboy boots , black hair swept back and huge sideburns framing his jowly face . He looks oddly bashful for a big man and he 's clutching something - the paperback of The Grasshopper Lies Heavy . He says to Phil , " I hope you do n't mind , sir , but I would be honored if you would sign this for me . " " We 're busy , " Emmet says , barely glancing at the man , but the man persists . " I realize that , sir , so I only ask for a moment of your time . " " We 're having a business meeting , " Emmet says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step backward . " Hey , it 's okay , " Phil says , and reaches out for the book - the man must have bought it in the hotel shop , the price sticker is still on the cover - uncaps his pen , asks the man 's name . The man blinks slowly . " Just your signature , sir , would be fine . " He has a husky baritone voice , a deep-grained Southern accent . Phil signs , hands back the book , a transaction so familiar he hardly has to think about it . The man is looking at Emmet , not the signed book . He says , " Do I know you , sir ? " " Not at all , " Emmet says sharply . " I think it 's just that you look like my old probation officer , " the man says . " I was in trouble as a kid , hanging about downtown with the wrong crowd . I had it in my head to be a musician , and well , I got into a little trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probation officer , Mr. McFly , he straightened me right out . I own a creme donut business now , that 's why I 'm here in Washington . We 're opening up a dozen new franchises . People surely do love our deep-fried creme donuts . Well , good day to you , sir , " he tells Phil , " I 'm glad to have met you . If you 'll forgive the presumption , I always thought you and me had something in common . We both of us have a dead twin , you see . " " Jesus , " Phil says , when the man has gone . The last remark has shaken him . " You 're famous , " Emmet tells him . " People know stuff about you , you should n't be surprised by now . He knows about your dead sister , so what ? He read it in a magazine somewhere , that 's all . " " He thought he knew you , too . " " Everyone looks like someone else , " Emmet says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Because a waiter is standing there , holding a white telephone on a tray . He says , " There 's a phone call for Mr. Dick , " and plugs the phone in and holds the receiver out to Phil . Even before Emmet peremptorily takes the phone , smoothly slipping the waiter a buck , Phil knows that it 's the White House . Emmet listens , says , " I do n't think it 's a good idea , " listens some more , says , " He 's not calm at all . Who is this Chapin ? Not one of - no , I did n't think he was . Haldeman says that , huh ? It went all the way up ? Okay . Yes , if Haldeman says so , but you better be sure of it , " he says , and sets down the receiver with an angry click and tells Phil , " That was Egil Krogh , at the White House . It seems you have a meeting with the President , at twelve-thirty tomorrow afternoon . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mess this up . " So now Phil is in the White House - in the anteroom to the Oval Office , a presentation copy of Voices from the Street under his arm , heavy as a brick . He 's speeding , too , and knows Emmet knows it , and does n't care . He did n't sleep well last night . Frankly , he did n't sleep at all . Taking a couple more tabs of speed did n't help . His mind racing . Full of weird thoughts , connections . Thinking especially about androids and people . The androids are taking over , he thinks , no doubt about it . The suits , the haircuts , the four permitted topics of conversation : sports , weather , TV , work . Christ , how could I not have seen it before ? He scribbles notes to himself , uses up the folder of complementary hotel stationery . Trying to get it down . To get it straight . Waves of anger and regret and anxiety surge through him . Maybe , he thinks in dismay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few days that I 'm really human , seeing things that are n't there , like the bum at the airport . Until they come for me , and take me to the repair shop . Or junk me , the way you 'd junk a broken toaster . Except the bum seemed so real , even if he was a dream , like a vision from a reality more vibrant than this . Suppose there is another reality : another history , the real history . And suppose that history has been erased by the government or the corporations or whatever , by entities that can reach back and smooth out the actions of individuals who might reveal or upset their plan to transform everyone and everything into bland androids in a dull gray completely controlled world .... It 's like one of the weird ideas he used to write up when he was churning out sci-fi stories , but that does n't mean it is n't true . Maybe back then he was unconsciously tapping into some flow of greater truth : the truth he should deliver to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly has a great desire to read in his pirated novel , but it is n't in his jacket pocket , and it is n't in his room . " I riot rid of it . " Emmet tells him over breakfast . " You got rid of it ? " " Of course I did . Should you be eating that , Phil ? " " I like Canadian bacon . I like maple syrup . I like pancakes . " " I 'm only thinking of your blood pressure , " Emmet says . He is calmly and methodically demolishing a grapefruit . " What about all the citrus fruit you eat ? All that acid ca n't be good for you . " " It 's cleansing , " Emmet says calmly . " You should at least drink the orange juice I ordered for you , Phil . It has vitamins . " " Coffee is all I need , " Phil says . The tumbler of juice , which was sitting at the table when he arrived , seems to give off a poisonous glow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we 're finished with breakfast , are n't we ? Let 's get you straightened out . You can hardly meet the President dressed like that . " But for once Phil stands his ground . He picked out these clothes because they felt right , and that 's what he 's going to wear . They argue for ten minutes , compromise by adding a tie Emmet buys in the hotel shop . They are outside , waiting for the car to be brought around , when Phil hears the music . He starts walking , prompted by some unconscious impulse he does n't want to analyze . Go with the flow , he thinks . Do n't impose anything on top of it just because you 're afraid . Because you 've been made afraid . Trust in the moment . Emmet follows angrily , asking Phil what the hell he thinks he 's doing all the way to the comer , where a bum is standing with a broken old guitar , singing one of that folk singer 's songs , the guy who died of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song about changing times . There 's a paper cup at the bum 's feet , and Phil impulsively stuffs half a dozen bills into it , bills which Emmet snatches up angrily . " Get lost , " he tells the bum , and starts pulling at Phil , dragging him away as if Phil is a kid entranced beyond patience at the window of a candy store . Saying , " What are you thinking ? " " That it 's cold , " Phil says , " and someone like that -a street person - could use some hot food . " " He 's is n't a person , " Emmet says . " He 's a bum - a piece of trash . And of course it 's cold . It 's March . Look at you , dressed like that . You 're shivering . " He is . But it is n't because of the cold . March , Phil thinks now , in the antechamber to the Oval Office . The Vernal Equinox . When the world awakes . Shivering all over again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desks covered , it seems , in telephones , is stiflingly hot . Emmet is schmoozing with two suits - H. R. Haldeman and Egil Krogh . Emmet is holding Haldeman 's arm as he talks , speaking into the man 's ear , something or other about management . They all know each other well , Phil thinks , and wonders what kind of business Emmet has , here in Washington , D.C. At last a phone rings , a secretary nods , and they go into the Oval Office , which really is oval . The President , smaller and more compact than he seems on TV , strides out from behind his desk and cracks a jowly smile , but his pouchy eyes slither sideways when he limply shakes hands with Phil . " That 's quite a letter you sent us , " the President says . " I 'm not sure , " Phil starts to say , but the President does n't seem to hear him . " Quite a letter , yes . And of course we need people like you , Mr. Dick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact . Someone who can speak to young people - well , that 's important is n't it ? " Smiling at the other men in the room as if seeking affirmation . " It 's quite a talent . You have one of your books there , I think ? " Phil holds out the copy of Voices from the Street . It 's the Franklin Library edition , bound in green leather , his signature reproduced in gold on the cover , under the title . An aide gave it to him when he arrived , and now he hands it to the President , who takes it in a study of reverence . " You must sign it , " the President says , and lays it open like a sacrificial victim on the gleaming desk , by the red and white phones . " I mean , that 's the thing is n't it ? The thing that you do ? " Phil says , " What I came to do - " And Emmet steps forward and says , " Of course he 'll sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives Phil a pen , and Phil signs , his hand sweating on the page . He says , " I came here , sir , to say that I want to do what I can for America . I was given an experience a day ago , and I 'm beginning to understand what it meant . " But the President does n't seem to have heard him . He 's staring at Phil as if seeing him for the first time . At last , he blinks and says , " Boy , you do dress kind of wild . " Phil is wearing his lucky Nehru jacket over a gold shirt , purple velvet pants with flares that mostly hide his sand-colored suede desert boots . And the tie that Emmet bought him in the hotel shop , a paisley affair like the President 's , tight as a noose around his neck . He starts to say , " I came here , sir , " but the President says again , " You do dress kind of wild . But that I guess is the style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an individual style . " For a moment , the President 's eyes , pinched between fleshy pouches , start to anxiously search Phil 's face . It seems that there 's something trapped far down at the bottom of his mild gaze , like a prisoner looking up through the grill of an oubliette at the sky . " Individual style , that 's exactly it , " Phil says , seeing an opening , a way into his theme . The thing he knows now he needs to say , distilled from the scattered notes and thoughts last night . " Individualism , sir , that 's what it 's all about , is n't it ? Even men in suits wear ties to signify that they still have this one little outlet for their individuality . " It occurs to him that his tie is exactly like the President 's , but he plunges on . " I 'm beginning to understand that things are changing in America , and that 's what I want to talk about - " " You wanted a badge , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is n't that right ? A badge to help your moral crusade ? " Emmet and Haldeman and Krogh grinning as if sharing a private joke . " The badge is n't important , " Phil says . " In fact , as I see it now , it 's just what 's wrong . " Haldeman says , " I certainly think we can oblige , ca n't we , Mr. President ? We can get him his badge . You know , as a gift . " The President blinks . " A badge ? I do n't know if I have one , but I can look , certainly - " " You do n't have one , " Haldeman says firmly . " I do n't ? " The President has bent to pull open a drawer in the desk , and now he looks up , still blinking . " But we 'll order one up , " Haldeman says , and tells Emmet , " Yes , a special order . " Something passes between them . Phil is sure of it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wrapped in mattress stuffing , and there 's a sharp taste to it that stings the back of his throat . Haldeman tells the President , " You remember the idea ? The idea about the book . " " Yes , " the President says , " the idea about the book . " His eyes seem to be blinking independently , like a mechanism that 's slightly out of adjustment . " The neat idea , " Haldeman prompts , as if to a recalcitrant or shy child , and Phil knows then , knows with utter deep black conviction , that the President is not the President . Or he is , but he 's long ago been turned into a fake of himself , a shell thing , a mechanical puppet . That was what I was becoming , Phil thinks , until the clear white light . And it might still happen to me , unless I make things change . " The neat idea , " the President says , and his mouth twitches . It 's meant to be a smile , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing , that you could write a book for the kids , for the , you know , for the young people . On the theme of , of - " " ' Get High on Life , " " Haldeman says . " Get High on Life , " " the President says . " Yes , that 's right , " and begins a spiel about affirming the conviction that true and lasting talent is the result of self-motivation and discipline ; he might be one of those mechanical puppets in Disneyland , running through its patter regardless of whether or not it has an audience . " Well , " Haldeman says , when the President finishes or perhaps runs down , " I think we 're done here . " " The gifts , " the President says , and bends down and pulls open a drawer and starts rummaging in it . " No one can accuse Dick Nixon of not treating his guests well , " he says , and lays on the desk , one after the other , a glossy presigned photograph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a picture of the White House . Emmet steps forward and says , " Thank you , Mr. President . Mr. Dick and I are truly honored to have met you . " But the President does n't seem to hear . He 's still rummaging in his desk drawer , muttering , " There are some neat pins in here . Lapel pins , very smart . " Haldeman and Emmet exchange glances , and Haldeman says , " We 're about out of time here , Mr. President . " " Pins , that 's the thing . Like this one , " the President says , touching the lapel of his suit , " with the American flag . I did have some .... " We 'll find them , " Haldeman says , that sharpness back in his voice , and he steers the President away from the desk , toward Phil . There 's an awkward minute while Egil Krogh takes photographs of the President and Phil shaking hands there on the blue carpet bordered with white stars , in front of furled flags on poles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera flash . Phil blinks them away as Emmet leads him out , through ordinary offices and blank corridors to chill air under a gray sky where their car is waiting . " It went well , " Emmet says , after a while . He 's driving the car - the car Phil hired - back to the hotel . Phil says , " Who are you , exactly ? What do you want ? " " I 'm your agent , Phil . I take care of you . That 's my job . " " And that other creature , your friend Haldeman , he takes care of the President . " " The President , he 's a work of art , is n't he ? He 'll win his third term , and the next one too . A man like that , he 's too useful to let go . Unlike you , Phil , he can still help us . " " He was beaten , " Phil says , " in 1960 . By Kennedy . And in 1962 he lost the election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced , he said he would give up politics . And then something happened . He came back . Or was he brought back , is that what it was ? A wooden horse , " Phil says , feeling hollow himself , as empty as a husk . " Brought by the Greeks as a gift . " " He wo n't get beaten again , " Emmet says , " you can count on that . Not in 1976 , not in 1980 , not in 1984 . It worked out , did n't it - you and him ? " He smiles , baring his perfect white teeth . " We should get you invited to one of the parties there . Maybe when you finish your book , it 'll be great publicity . " " You do n't want me to finish the book , " Phil says . He feels as if he 's choking , and wrenches at the knot of his tie . " That 's the point . Whatever I was supposed to do - you made sure I did n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Emmet says . " Is this another of your wild conspiracy theories ? What is it this time , a conspiracy of boring , staid suits , acting in concert to stifle creative guys like you ? Well , listen up , buddy . There is no conspiracy . There 's nothing but a bunch of ordinary guys doing an honest day 's work , making the world a better place , the best way they know how . You think we 're dangerous ? Well , take a look at yourself , Phil , You 've got everything you ever dreamed about , and you got it all thanks to me . If it was n't for me , you 'd be no better than a bum on the street . You 'd be living in a cold-water walk-up , banging out porno novels or sci-fi trash as fast you could , just to keep the power company from switching off your lights . And moaning all the while that you could have been a contender . Get real , Phil . I gave you a good deal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the guy at the hotel , the donut guy , got ? He was supposed to be a singer , and someone just like you did something to him . " " He could have changed popular music , " Emmet says . " Even as a donut shop operator he still has something . But would he have been any happier ? I do n't think so . And that 's all I 'm going to say , Phil . Do n't ever ask again . Go back to your nice house , work on your book , and do n't make trouble . Or , if you 're not careful , you might be found dead one day from vitamin poisoning , or maybe a drug overdose . " " Yeah , like the folk singer . " Phil says . " Or a car crash , " Emmet says , " like the one that killed Kerouac and Burroughs and Ginsberg in Mexico . It 's a cruel world out there , Phil , and even though you 're washed up as a writer , be thankful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Because you want to make sure I do n't count for anything , " Phil says , and finally opens the loop of the tie wide enough to be able to drag , it over his head . He winds down the window and drops the tie into the cold gritty wind . " You stupid bastard , " Emmet says , quite without anger . " That cost six bucks fifty. , Pure silk , a work of art . " " I feel sick , " Phil says , and he does feel sick , but that 's not why he says it . " Not in the car , " Emmet says sharply , and pulls over to the curb . Phil opens the door , and then he 's running and Emmet is shouting after him . But Phil runs on , head down in the cold wind , and does n't once look back He has to slow to a walk after a couple of blocks , out of breath , his heart pounding , his legs aching . The cold , steely air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given Emmet the slip . Or perhaps Emmet does n't really care . After all , he 's been ruined as a writer , his gift dribbled away on dead books until nothing is left . Except for that one book , Phil thinks . The Man in the High Castle . The book Emmet conspired to suppress , the book he made me hate so much because it was the kind of thing I was meant to write all along . Because I would have counted for something , in the end . I would have made a difference . He walks on , with no clear plan except to keep moving . It 's a poor neighborhood , even though it 's only a few blocks from the White House . Despite the cold , people are sitting on the steps of the shabby apartment houses , talking to each other , sharing bottles in brown paper bags . An old man with a terrific head of white hair and a tremendously bushy white moustache sits straight-backed on a kitchen chair , smoking a cheap cigar with all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knitted caps and plaid jackets bounce a basketball against a wall , calling to each other in clear , high voices . There are Christmas decorations at most windows , and the odors of cooking in the air . A good odor , Phil thinks , a homely , human odor . A radio tuned to a country station is playing one of the old time ballads , a slow , achingly sad song about a rose and a brier twining together above a grave . It 's getting dark , and flakes of snow begin to flutter down , seeming to condense out of the darkening air , falling in a slanting rush . Phil feels the pinpoint kiss of every flake that touches his face . I 'm still a writer , he thinks , as he walks through the falling snow . I still have a name . I still have a voice . I can still tell the truth . Maybe that journalist who interviewed me last month , the one who works for the Washington Post , maybe he 'll listen to me if I tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bum is standing on the corner outside the steamed window of a diner . An old , fat woman with a mottled , flushed , face , gray hair cut as short as a soldier 's . Wearing a stained and tom man 's raincoat that 's too small for her , so that the newspapers she 's wrapped around her body to keep out the cold peep out between the straining buttons . Her blue eyes are bright , watching each passerby with undiminished hope as she rattles a few pennies in a paper cup . Phil pushes into the diner 's steamy warmth and uses the pay phone , and then orders coffee to go . And returns to the street , and presses the warm container into his sister 's hand .
