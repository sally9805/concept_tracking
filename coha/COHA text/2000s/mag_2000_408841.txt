ANSWERS TO YOUR QUESTIONS ABOUT FAST WEIGHT LOSS ; TEENS AND BODY IMAGE ; WEIGHT GAIN AT MENOPAUSE ; TESTING FOR NUTRIENT DEFICIENCIES ; AND MORE . // Q A friend of mine recently told me about a company that performs a blood test to determine vitamin and mineral deficiencies . Is this test worth my while ? A " There is no simple blood test to measure your vitamin or mineral status , " says Chris Rosenbloom , Ph.D. , R.D. , and associate professor of nutrition at Georgia State University , Atlanta . " That is not something accepted in the nutrition community , and claims like that should raise a red flag . " Detecting vitamin and mineral deficiencies is a complex process , Rosenbloom says . " There is a different test to determine the status of each nutrient , and the tests are very expensive . " Even detecting iron deficiency usually requires more than just one test . What 's more , some of the tests that are used to assess vitamin and mineral levels - such as a blood test for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your body 's calcium is in your bones ; only 1-2 percent is actually in your blood . However , your blood calcium is so important for keeping your heart pumping and your nervous system humming that the body will maintain normal blood calcium levels at the expense of your bone calcium . " You could have osteoporosis and still have normal blood calcium levels , " Rosenbloom explains . The best way to assess your nutritional status is to record everything you eat and drink for three days and have the results analyzed by a registered dietitian . Or , make the analysis yourself using nutritional software or a nutrition Web site such as www.cyberdiet.com . The U.S. Department of Agriculture 's Food and Information Center ( www.nal.usda.gov/fnic ) has links to other nutrition analysis sites and a listing of nutritional software . " If you find that you 're getting less than 75 percent of the RDA for a particular nutrient , you may have a problem with that nutrient , " Rosenbloom says . Q You oppose a " quick fix " approach to weight loss . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends on how much you need to lose . If you have 50 extra pounds , you 're likely to lose weight more quickly at first than if you have 10 pounds to lose . Consider how long it took you to gain the weight , and as a rule , do n't lose more than 1/2-1 pound a week , says Jo Ann Hattner , R.D. , M.Ph. , a spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association . If you lose weight too fast : 1 ) you 're likely to gain it back ; 2 ) you 'll lose muscle along with fat ; and 3 ) you 're probably on an eating plan that 's too restrictive and does n't meet your nutritional needs . Q I 've gained 40 pounds in the two years since I took a sedentary job . I consume 1,200-1,900 calories day and do 7-10 hours of moderate to high  --  intensity exercise a week but ca n't seem to lose the weight . What am I doing wrong ? A Research shows that people significantly underestimate how much they eat and overestimate how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Calories can be sneaky , whether it 's the soft drinks between meals or grabbing a handful from the candy bowl at the office . All of those extras add up , and you 're probably not counting them , " says Chicago nutritionist Janet Helm , M.S. , R.D. , a spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association . It is also tough to estimate calories in unpackaged foods , particularly at restaurants . You have no idea how much butter was mixed into your mashed potatoes or how much oil was poured into your spaghetti marinara . You may be underestimating portion sizes , too . You may have heard that a food has 200 calories a serving , but you may be eating three servings , Helm says . As for exercise , you may be counting total time spent at the gym ( parking , changing clothes , resting ) rather than actual exercise time . For help , contact a registered dietitian and a trainer who specialize in weight loss . Q My 15-year-old daughter and her friends constantly complain that they 're too fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of them are painfully thin . Is it my imagination , or do girls today have more body-image problems than we did ? Why is this happening ? A " Girls do seem to have a poorer body image today , " says psychologist Alan Feingold , Ph.D. , an associate research scientist at Yale Medical School in New Haven , Conn . Researchers ca n't confirm this observation with hard numbers , Feingold says , because studies have generally been short-term . Also , studies have measured body satisfaction in so many different ways that comparing the results over time is like comparing apples and oranges . However , Feingold 's research does show one strong trend : a growing gender gap . Before 1970 , girls were no more unhappy with their bodies than were boys . " Now , girls are much more dissatisfied than boys , " says Feingold , co-author of a review in Psychological Science last year of 222 body-image studies over the past 50 years . He attributes this to increased pressure on girls and women . It used to be that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the kids and have dinner ready for her family , he says . " Now , they are expected to be super mothers , successful on the job and sexy . Even in the workplace , they seem to be judged on their looks . " Q My mother is 50 years old , and she is starting to go through menopause . She has always had a great metabolism , but lately she has been gaining weight , despite increasing her exercise activity . She is very discouraged . Is there anything she can do to stop the weight gain ? A " Reassure your mother that this is a very common complaint , " says gynecologist and menopause expert Michelle Battistini , M.D. , director of PENN Health for Women at the University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia . " Women frequently gain weight in their late 40s and early 50s , and then the weight gain tapers off . " Some of this weight gain appears to be easier fat gain that 's related to hormonal changes that start occurring even before the onset of menopause . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also due to a more-sedentary lifestyle . Even though your mom is extending her workouts , she may be less active in the rest of her life . It is particularly important for her to do weight training , which will help her preserve muscle mass and thereby maintain her metabolism . She also should scrutinize her eating habits . Many women start eating out more at this age because their children are no longer in the house . " They may have a glass of wine with dinner and not count those hidden calories , " Battistini says . Also , many menopausal women turn to soy products to relieve hot flashes - but they forget that soy products can be high in calories . If you are drinking soy milk three times a day , Battistini says , what other food ( i.e. , calories ) are you dropping from your diet ? Your mother may want to exercise longer , harder or more frequently . But she should not try anything drastic . " I tell my patients to save themselves the time and trouble of dieting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixes . " Q I 've been weight training for two years and have slimmed down quite a bit . However , my thigh muscles have gotten too large . I 've started lifting less weight and doing more repetitions , but the muscles still wo n't decrease in size . How can I lose some of the muscle without putting back the fat ? A " Do n't try to lose muscle ! " says Chicago fitness trainer CC Cunningham , a spokeswoman for the American Council on Exercise . Muscle actually takes up less space than the same amount of fat . Check your overall level of body fat and perhaps increase your walking or running to try to get leaner thighs . And be happy that you are able to get that sort of muscle strength and definition . As you get older , you will inevitably lose muscle and strength ; so , the more muscle you bank in your youth , the more you 'll have in reserve for later years . " You 're less likely to become weak and frail when you 're older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for maintaining your metabolism . If you hang on to your muscle , you 'll probably gain less fat as you age . Do n't reduce your weights so much that you can perform more than 12-15 repetitions . Doing dozens of reps with light weights will only cause you to lose strength and may even overstress your joints . Q As an avid hunter , I consume some meats that do not come packaged with nutrition information . How does wild game like venison , wild hog and rabbit compare with beef , ham and chicken ? A " Because wild animals are very active , they 're generally leaner , " says Chicago nutritionist Janet Helm , M.S. , RD . " But as with most meat , the fat content depends on the cut . Loin cuts are leaner than ribs . " Three ounces of roasted venison contain 134 calories and 2.7 fat grams ( 1.1 grams saturated ) . This is nearly identical to select-grade ( the leanest cut ) eye of round and much leaner than T-bone steak ( 275 calories and 21 fat grams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 3.8 fat grams ( 1.1 grams saturated ) per 3-ounce serving  --  slightly less than pork tenderloin . Other pork cuts have significantly more fat . As for wild rabbit : 3 ounces contain 147 calories and 3 grams of fat ( 0.8 gram saturated ) , essentially the same as skinless chicken breast . ( Leave the skin on and the chicken contains twice the fat and saturated fat . ) No matter what kind of meat you eat , trim all visible fat , use low-fat preparation methods and keep your portions small . " Three ounces is the size of a deck of cards , " Helm says , " but most people eat twice that amount .
