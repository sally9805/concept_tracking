1 Two Years Earlier // One weekday afternoon in May 2004 , General George Casey bounded up the stairs to the third floor of his government-furnished quarters , a beautiful old brick mansion on the Potomac River at Fort McNair in Washington , D.C. His wife , Sheila , was packing for a move across the river to Fort Myer , in Virginia , the designated quarters of the Army 's vice chief of staff . // " Please , sit down , " Casey said . // In 34 years of marriage , he had never made such a request . // President Bush , Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and the Army chief of staff had asked him to become the top U.S. commander in Iraq , he said . // Sheila Casey burst into tears . Like any military spouse , she dreaded the long absences and endless anxieties of separation , the strains of a marriage carried out half a world apart . But she also recognized it was an incredible opportunity for her husband . Casey saw the Iraq War as a pivot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would likely define America 's future standing in the world , Bush 's legacy and his own reputation as a general . // " This is going to be hard , " Casey said , but he felt as qualified as anyone else . // Casey 's climb to four-star status had been unusual . Instead of graduating from West Point , he had studied international relations at Georgetown University . He 'd been there during the Vietnam War and was a member of ROTC , the Reserve Officers ' Training Corps . He remembered how some students had spit on him and hurled things when he crossed campus in uniform . In 1970 , after his graduation and commissioning as an Army second lieutenant , his father and namesake , a two-star Army general commanding the celebrated 1st Cavalry Division , was killed in Vietnam when his helicopter crashed en route to visit wounded soldiers . // Casey had never intended to make the Army his career . And yet he fell in love with the sense of total responsibility that even a young second lieutenant was given for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years in the Army , he was going to be the commander on the ground , as General William Westmoreland had been in Vietnam from 1965 to 1968 . Casey had no intention of ending up like Westmoreland , whom history had judged as that era 's poster boy for quagmire and failure . // Casey had never been in combat . His most relevant experience was in the Balkans  --  Bosnia and Kosovo  --  where irregular warfare had been the order of the day . He had held some of the most visible " thinker " positions in the Pentagon  --  head of the Joint Staff strategic plans and policy directorate , J-5 , and then the prestigious directorship of the Joint Staff , which served the chiefs . But aside from a 1981 stint in Cairo as a United Nations military observer , he had spent little time in the Middle East . // After getting Sheila 's blessing , Casey met with Rumsfeld . The two sat at a small table in the center of the secretary 's office . " Attitude " was important , Rumsfeld explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers to let the Iraqis grow and do what they needed to do themselves . The general attitude in the U.S. military was " We can do this . Get out of our way . We 'll take care of it . You guys stand over there . " That would not spell success in Iraq , Rumsfeld explained . As he often would describe it later , the task in Iraq was to remove the training wheels and get American hands off the back of the Iraqi bicycle seat . // For the most part , Casey agreed . // " Take about 30 days , and then give me your assessment , " Rumsfeld directed . // Casey was heartened that Rumsfeld and he shared a common vision . But he was surprised that the secretary of defense had devoted only about 10 minutes for a meeting with the man about to take over the most important assignment in the U.S. military . // The president held a small dinner at the White House for Casey and John Negroponte , the newly designated ambassador to Iraq , their spouses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a way to say good luck . // Casey went to see Secretary of State Colin Powell , who had served in the Army for 35 years and been the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the 1991 Gulf War . Powell did not conceal his bitterness . Rumsfeld is screwing it all up , he told Casey . Marc Grossman , one of Powell 's senior deputies and an old friend of Casey 's , put it more pointedly . " These guys at DOD are just assholes , " he said , " and I do n't have any more patience for them . " // Casey concluded that there was no clear direction on Iraq , so he invited Negroponte to his office at the Pentagon . // Negroponte , then the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , had volunteered for the Iraq ambassadorship . At 64 , he was a 40-year veteran of the Foreign Service . He believed that an ambassador was the executor of policy made in Washington . He and Casey agreed that they were n't getting much guidance from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we get over there ? " Casey asked , and they started to hammer out a brief statement of purpose . The goal was a country at peace with its neighbors , with a representative government , which respected human rights for all Iraqis and would not become a safe haven for terrorists . // The general and the ambassador were pleased with their draft . They had laid out mostly political goals , despite the fact that the United States ' main leverage was its nearly 150,000 troops on the ground . * * * // In Iraq , Casey relieved Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez , who had been the junior three-star in the Army when he had taken command of the forces the previous year . Casey asked him to stick around for a while after the change of command ceremony . Over dinner , Sanchez unloaded his bitterness about the lack of support he felt he had received from the Army , the Pentagon and Washington . " This is ten times harder than Kosovo , " he said . // Casey could relate . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ethnic cleansing and other violence in the Balkans . // He met with officers from the CIA station in Baghdad . They posed ominous questions : Could the whole enterprise work ? What was the relationship between the political and military goals ? Casey and Negroponte had settled on the political goals , but how would Casey achieve the military goal of keeping Iraq from becoming a safe haven for terrorists ? As he was briefed and as he read the intelligence , he saw that terrorists had safe havens in at least four Iraq cities  --  Fallujah , Najaf , Samarra and , for all practical purposes , the Sadr City neighborhood in Baghdad . // As Casey had passed through neighboring Kuwait on his way to Baghdad , the Third Army officers had a message for him : " If you want to understand this , you need to talk to Derek Harvey . " // Harvey , a 49-year-old retired Army colonel and Middle East specialist who worked for the Defense Intelligence Agency , was a controversial figure within the U.S. intelligence world . He believed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information in the field rather than relying solely on reports and statistics . // In the late 1980s , Harvey traveled throughout Iraq by taxicab  --  500 miles , village to village  --  interviewing locals , sleeping on mud floors with a shower curtain for a door . He resembled the television detective Columbo  --  full of questions , intensely curious and entirely nonthreatening . After the 1991 Gulf War , when the CIA was predicting the inevitable fall of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein , Harvey , then a major , insisted that Hussein would survive because members of the Sunni community knew their fortunes were tied to his . He was right . Months before the 9/11 terrorist attacks , Harvey wrote an intelligence paper declaring that al Qaeda and the Taliban leadership in Afghanistan posed a strategic threat to the United States . // After the 2003 invasion of Iraq , Harvey had intermittent Army assignments in the country , traveling quietly , talking to insurgents , sitting in interrogation rooms . // One of his approaches was so-called DOCEX  --  document exploitation . He spent hours poring over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saddam 's briefcases . It was clear to him early on that a vacuum existed in Baghdad . Where was political power ? // Harvey made scouting missions into the provinces in an SUV , making contact with tribes , learning that former Baathist regime leaders , generals and other former officers were reuniting . He studied documents and letters found in buildings that U.S. forces had raided . Together with his interviews , they told a story : The old regime elements had plans to create a violent , hostile environment . // Within U.S. intelligence agencies , a debate was taking place about how much real organization existed among the insurgents . Who was really in control ? Harvey found that the insurgency was based on the old trust networks of professional , tribal and family relationships connected with the mosques . Guidance , instructions and exhortation  --  even the planning documents for operations  --  were often written in the religious language of holy war . // Harvey found that U.S. units had reported a lot of attacks when they first arrived , but the longer they stayed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the troops had appeased or vanquished the insurgents . Rather , near the end of their tours , they ventured out into the population less and less  --  sometimes never . He also concluded that only 22 to 26 percent of the violence directed at U.S. forces was being reported . // General Sanchez never bought into Harvey 's conclusions about the insurgency , even as officially measured violence in the classified SECRET reports kept rising . During one four-month period in mid-2004 , the attacks doubled from about 1,000 a month to 2,000. * * * // Casey summoned Harvey to a meeting in early July 2004 . Harvey found the general on a balcony at his new headquarters at Camp Victory , gazing out over Baghdad . Casey held up two cigars . // " Do you smoke ? " // Harvey nodded . // " Okay , come with me. " // What 's really going on in Iraq ? Casey asked . // The Sunni insurgency is growing and getting worse , Harvey explained . It 's organized . It 's coherent . And its members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They believe they are doing well , and by any measurement they are  --  the number of attacks , their logistics , their financing , their external support , freedom of movement , ability to recruit . Every trend line was going up . Way up . // The insurgency is not a guerrilla war designed to win political power , he said . " It 's all about wearing you out , getting you to leave and subverting the existing order , and infiltrating and co-opting the emerging Iraqi institutions . " // The Iraqi government was weak , he added . It needed to be stronger , much stronger , but the United States was not going to change the attitudes or the culture . " We have to work around them , " he said . " You 're not going to force them to make decisions that they 're not comfortable with . We do n't have the leverage . We really don't. " // Harvey said the Americans must learn to operate with humility , because there was so much they did n't understand about how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , but we 're delusional . We get these glimpses , and we extrapolate . But if you really dig , what 's it all really based on ? Only whispers of the truth . " We do n't understand the fight we 're in , " he said . // Harvey said the revelations about abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib months earlier had inflamed Iraqis . Photographs of smiling U.S. soldiers alongside naked , hooded , manacled and leashed inmates had flooded newspapers , television screens and the Internet . They had spread like a lightning bolt through Iraqi society and sent a devastating message : The U.S. occupation was the new oppressor. // As their cigars burned down and their conversation drew to a close , Harvey fixed his gaze on the new commanding general . " We 're in trouble . " // In Washington , infighting over the war had gone from bad to worse within the administration since the 2003 invasion . // " Control is what politics is all about , " legendary journalist Theodore H. White wrote . War is also about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the strategy and policy are supposed to be set . But from the start , no one in the administration had control over Iraq policy . // In the early days of the war , the president 's national security adviser , Condoleezza Rice , and Hadley , her deputy at the time , had worked on Iraq nonstop and yet they never got control over the policy making . They were no match for Rumsfeld . The president had signed a directive before the invasion , giving the authority for an occupation to the Defense Department . // Bush and Rumsfeld 's selection of L. Paul Bremer , a career diplomat , to act as the viceroy of Iraq further diminished the role of Rice and Hadley , as well as Powell at the State Department . Bremer all but ignored the National Security Council . // " We 're all told to stay out of it , " Hadley complained to a colleague . " This is Don Rumsfeld 's thing . " // Bremer , who as a presidential envoy had a direct reporting line to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and abruptly . Some of those decisions proved disastrous , such as disbanding the Iraqi army and excluding from government service tens of thousands of former members of Saddam 's Baath Party . // Rumsfeld had his own view of how the U.S. should proceed . He would send out one of his " snowflakes , " brief documents asking questions , looking for details , demanding answers , when it was unclear to him what had happened . Though unsigned , everyone knew they represented his orders or questions . But if a snowflake leaked , it provided deniability. // The snowflake sent on October 28 , 2003 , was two pages long and classified SECRET : " Subject : Risk and the way ahead in Iraq . In discussing the way ahead in Iraq , all agree that we should give Iraqis more authority more quickly . " // Powell had a different view . Control was about security . In the first year after the invasion , Bush and Rice repeatedly expressed worry that the oil production in Iraq and availability of electricity were dropping  --  visible signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invasion . // " Petroleum is interesting . Electricity is interesting , " Powell said , but added , " Mr. President , none of this makes any difference unless there 's security ... Security is all that counts right now . " //
