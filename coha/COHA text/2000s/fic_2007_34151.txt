Chapter One The tiny , southern California town of San Carmelita had its picturesque areas where Hollywood celebrities browsed for antiques , shopped quaint boutiques , and sunned themselves on pristine beaches . But Saul 's pawnshop was n't in any of those areas . Saulie 's was on the other side of town , the part of town that the city council frequently discussed at meetings , trying to figure out new , cheap ways to spruce up the neighborhood . Or at least keep tourists out of it , so they would n't get themselves mugged or perforated by a stray bullet . Nestled snugly between a tattoo parlor and a porn store , Saul 's shabby little hockshop had been trading valuables of questionable ownership for instant cash for over fifty years . But Saul himself was neither shabby nor questionable . He was a character , and he also had character ... which made him one of Savannah Reid 's favorite people . As she and her friend , Detective Sergeant Dirk Coulter , left Dirk 's old Buick and walked up the sidewalk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to allow a teenage boy and his pit bull to pass , giving the dog and his master plenty of room . Wearing full gang attire and a surly , wanna-piece-of-me ? scowl on his face , thegangbanger looked threatening enough without his wide-jawed , excessively toothsome companion . And while the streetwise Savannah had kids like him for lunch on a bologna sandwich spread with plenty of mustard and a dab of mayo , she made it a point to avoid pit bulls whenever possible . Dirk nudged her with his elbow . " Afraid of a little puppy dog ? " he said . " Puppy dog , my hind end , " she replied , her Southern drawl thick , despite all her years on the West Coast . " Remember when we saw a ' pup ' like that one take a chunk out of a patrolman 's thigh a few blocks from here ? All because the cop jumped over a fence and into the wrong yard , chasing a perp ? " Dirk shuddered . " Gross . Like I 'm gon na forget that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked graveyard back then . " Savannah felt her own little chill . During the years she and Dirk had served together on the San Carmelita police force , they had seen some pretty nasty stuff in the noonday sun , too . Heart-wrenching , soul-scarring images that kept you awake at night . Unless you read a lot of trashy novels right before bedtime and ate a lot of chocolate-Savannah 's remedies for just about any of life 's unpleasantries . Dirk was still a cop-still collecting nightmare material . Savannah had moved on to greener pastures and become a private detective . Well , sometimes the grass was greener ... when she actually had a paying client or two . Then there were the other times , like this one , when she had absolutely nothing to do except tag along with Dirk . As they passed one seedy establishment after another , she wondered if there was n't a better way to spend a Saturday afternoon than hanging out on the bad side of the tracks with a guy who had been gruff in his twenties and grumpy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were solidly in their forties , he had worked his way up to a five-star curmudgeon . Dirk let go with a deep , chest-rattling cough , which he tried his best to suppress . She knew why . And it was n't going to work . " That 's the third chest cold you 've had this spring , " she said . " Not to mention the four sinus infections and all the sore throats . " He growled under his breath . " So , do n't mention it . Do n't you start nagging me , woman . I wo n't stand for it . " " Since when ? I 've nagged you to quit smoking since the day we met . Pointing out all of your faults keeps me from having to focus on my own . So , why stop now ? " " Because I 'm gon na fly into a blind rage if you do n't . I 've had enough of your- " More gagging and coughing took his breath away , along with the rest of his argument . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rages , " she said . " I live in fear . " When they reached Saul 's front door , Dirk opened it and stood aside for her to enter . Savannah liked that . Right after a cigarette , he might smell like a Las Vegas casino , but Dirk was still an old-fashioned gentleman . Dark and dank , the tiny pawnshop needed a good airing . The only bright spots in the glum establishment were the glass-front counters that held treasures ranging from estate jewelry and fake estate jewelry to dented French horns and antique typewriters . A small gnome of a man appeared at the tinkling of the silver bells that hung above the door . He was wiping his hands on a dirty cloth as he came out of the back room , a hopeful look on his wizened face . But at the sight of Dirk , his bright , entrepreneurial grin disappeared . " Oh , it is only you , " he said with a slight Slavic accent . " I must say this to you , I 'm not a happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lie to his customers , to deceive them , to deliver them into the hands of the law . If word gets around that I do this ... " " The guys who are trying to unload their stolen crap will take it elsewhere , " Dirk told him . " That 's a good thing , right ? " Saul grimaced . " I suppose so . " He turned to Savannah and his eyes lit up ever so slightly . " I am happy to see you , though , Savannah , my dear . It is not every day a pretty woman comes into Saul 's store . " " Forget about the pretty girls for a minute , Saulie , " Savannah said , giving him the benefit of a brief smile before turning all-business , " and tell us about the ugly mug you 're expecting to come in here this afternoon . " " Ah , that one . " Saul shook his head . " He 's a bad fellow , I tell you . About a month ago , he comes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has no papers for . And when I refuse to buy it , he gets so very angry , I swear I think he is going to shoot me with it . " " And you were probably right , " Savannah told him . " Always trust your instincts , Saul . In your business you ca n't afford not to . " Dirk glanced down into one of the glass cases , then bent over , taking a better look at a bowie knife with a rosewood handle . " Tell me exactly what he said when he called you this morning . " Saul cast a quick look at Savannah . " I will not repeat exactly what he said in front of a lady , but he told me he had a woman 's Raymond Weil watch and a gentleman 's Tutima . Said he wanted to be rid of them this afternoon . Well , that Tutima rang a bell in my brain . Saul may be old , but he 's not so stupid as some think . I grabbed the ... what you police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick while I still had him on the phone . And there it was , third item on the page : a Tutima with ' Merry Christmas , Uncle Carl ' engraved on the back of it . So , I asked him if it was clean , mint condition , and he said , ' All except for a short message on the back . ' Claims he 'd had it engraved for his beloved uncle , but dear Uncle Carl-may he rest in peace-passed away before he could give it to him on Christmas . " " Heartbreaking story , " Savannah muttered . " Ai n't it though ? " Dirk added . " Let 's get this bastard . " " And return Uncle Carl 's watch to him ... whoever he may be , " she said . Saul 's eyes brightened at the prospect . " I have suffered too many losses from these no-goods who come in here and sell me stolen items . And then you police come along behind them , take the merchandise and leave me with nothing but empty hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them in the act and let him take the loss for a change-let him be the one who is disappointed and upset . " " A good feeling ? " Savannah laughed . " Oh , Saul , you have no idea how good you 're going to feel if we nail this guy . Revenge is better than a hot fudge sundae ... with two cherries on top ! " Half an hour later , they were ready for the vendor of fine , recently pilfered goods to walk through the door . Savannah stood behind the counter , trying to look like a proper pawnshop clerk-which meant trying not to stare at the pretty sparklies in the jewelry cases that were constantly snagging her attention . And Dirk sat on a folding chair , just inside the door that led to the back room , within earshot , but out of view of anyone coming into the shop . As Saul chattered nervously away in Savannah 's ear , she wondered briefly if it might be a mistake , asking this frail , elderly man to cooperate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart attack right in the middle of the takedown ? She was current on her CPR , but she could n't imagine bouncing up and down on that skinny little rib cage . Savannah would never be accused of being a lightweight ; she was a " real " woman , gifted with a sturdy , hearty frame and plenty of feminine embellishments to flesh it out . She knew she had the capacity to mash old Saul flat as a flitter-as her Granny Reid would say . Savannah had never been sure exactly what a flitter was , but she was certain you could easily slip it under a tight door . And sure as shootin ' , nobody wanted to be one . " So , tell me , pretty Savannah ... when are you going to come in here and shop for an engagement ring ? " Saul wanted to know as he rubbed some jewelers ' rouge on a cloth and began to buff a candlestick . " Uh ... maybe when I find somebody I want to be engaged to . " Saul nodded his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you with those beautiful blue eyes and all that shiny dark hair ? You must have suitors lined up outside your doorway with flowers and candies . No ? " " Mmm , not so 's you 'd notice , Saulie . " She gave him a flirty grin that deepened her dimples . " There 's plenty of room on my porch if you want to show up with roses and a box of Godiva 's chocolates . " " Ah , I 'm too old to do anything but look . But how about that one in there ? " He nodded toward the back room where Dirk sat . " Any chance of him wanting to put a ring on your finger someday ? " Savannah snorted . " More like , any chance of me holding still for it ? Saulie , go wash your mouth out with soap , saying a thing like that . It 'll never happen . That one in there wants to marry me about as much as I want to marry him . " " And how much is that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hinted at a younger , more virile fellow still lurking inside his timeworn body . A cough rumbled on the other side of the door , followed by some throat clearing . " You two hens wan na stop cackling in there , " Dirk said , " and stay sharp ? In case you have n't looked at a clock lately , this afternoon is just about up . It 's a quarter to five . This guy better show soon . I 'm getting hungry . " " Oh , stop your griping , " Savannah snapped . " I told you I 've got a chicken stewing on the back burner at home . You 're getting a free chicken and dumplin ' dinner tonight . Biscuits , too . That should enough to-oh-heads up . We got company coming . " She turned to Saul . " Is that your buddy ? " Saul craned his neck to look out the window . He jumped to attention . " That 's him ! That 's the one who calls himself R.L. Can you imagine a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , instead of a proper name ? That alone shows what a hoodlum he must be . I would wager he 's already spent time in prison . " Instantly , Savannah thought of a dozen good ol ' boys from her home state of Georgia who went by assorted initials in lieu of full names . She knew a J.D. , a J.P. , a J.R. , and a J.B. , just for starters . All fine , upstanding , proud sons of the South-they had n't served more than thirty years of hard prison time between them . And most of that was for " thumpin ' " on other , less upstanding , good ol ' boys who 'd been asking for it . Nope . Saulie 's theory just did n't hold water . But R.L. looked like he might be an exception . He did look like a hoodlum , from the metal-studded leather vest that he wore with no shirt underneath , to the spiked dog collar around his neck , from the five-inch-high black Mohawk , to the swastika tattoo proudly displayed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormous skull-and-crossbones ring on his right forefinger that would be nasty in a fistfight , should one ensue in the process of taking him into custody . No , R.L. did n't look like your average accountant or Sunday school teacher . He looked like exactly the kind of guy Savannah enjoyed busting-somebody who continually did nasty , ornery things to nice people , but was cocksure that they would forever get away with it . She loved proving them wrong . As he sauntered through the front door , she rearranged her face from a self-satisfied smirk to the look of a moderately bored clerk who was looking forward to going home at five sharp . " May I help you ? " she asked R.L. as her eyes casually scanned the rest of his person , looking for any telltale bulge that might signify a weapon-other than the oversized skull ring . But the ring was all she saw . He walked past her and over to where Saul stood . " Nope . Saul here is my man , " he said . " I called earlier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Weil and the Tutima ? " Saul laid his polishing cloth down on the counter . Savannah noticed that his hand was trembling . Again , she felt a pang of concern for her old friend . This sort of thing was nerve-wracking on anyone , let alone an octogenarian who had lost his wife only a year ago and had survived a triple bypass just last winter . " That 's me . " R.L. glanced over at Savannah , then toward the front door and the back of the store . " Let 's do some business . And do n't take all day about it either , old man . I got places to go , things to do . " Saul bristled at the " old man " comment , pulled himself a couple of inches taller , and stuck out his chin . " Not so fast , young man . Saul takes his time and conducts his business in proper fashion . Let me see what you have to sell and , if you wish to do business with me , remember to address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave a little snort , then dug into the front pocket of his jeans . He pulled out a couple of fine watches and dumped them onto the glass countertop as though they were nothing but a couple of carnival trinkets . " There , " he said . " I told you they were expensive stuff . New . Never even worn . So do n't go trying to cheat me . I want full price for these . " Saul pulled a pair of glasses from his shirt pocket , then took his time unfolding them and slipping them on . As he studied the pieces carefully , turning each one over and over in his expert hands , he said , " I 'm sure you came by these fine pieces in a perfectly legal way . Eh , my impudent fellow ? " R.L. started to answer , then paused , mentally snagged on the word impudent . Then , unable to decide if he 'd been insulted or not , he said , " Sure . Like I told you , legal all the way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Saul cleared his throat , looked up from the watches , and gave Savannah a big , toothsome smile . Suddenly , he looked years younger and decades stronger . " These watches , " he announced in a loud , clear voice , " are exactly as we thought . We can conclude our business now if you like . " At his words , Savannah reached under her jacket and pulled her Beretta from its holster . She pointed the barrel at a spot a couple of inches below R.L. 's Mohawk . " Freeze , " she told him . " Do n't you even twitch , son , or you 'll have a whole new hairdo with a permanent part . " Half a second later , Dirk came around the corner , his revolver drawn . When he saw the suspect , he smiled as brightly as Saul . " Well , hello again , " he said . " I remember you , you worthless pile of dog crap . I busted you about two years ago for robbing a church 's poor box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about days of yore , Savannah was moving around the counter , intending to position herself between their suspect and the doorway . But she was watching him , his every movement ... most importantly , his eyes . And she knew the instant he made the decision . " No ! " she shouted as he spun on his heel and headed for the doorway . " Do n't you run , you little- " She banged her hip hard on the corner of the glass cabinet as she rounded it , but she hardly felt the pain because of the jolt of adrenaline that had hit her bloodstream . She headed for the door , about six steps behind their now-on-the-run thief . R.L. and his ugly leather vest shot out the door with Savannah on his heels and Dirk behind her . He took off down the sidewalk , running with the grace of a recently decapitated chicken , knocking his fellow pedestrians aside and a kid off his bicycle . But what he lacked in beauty , he made up in determination . The guy was pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a couple of blocks , she could hear Dirk huffing and puffing behind her . An excellent runner with longer legs than hers , he normally overtook and passed her when they were in a footrace . But this time it was she who was in the lead when their quarry changed routes and headed down a side street toward the old mission . (
