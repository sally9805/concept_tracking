I rarely go back to the ranch where I was born or to the neighboring land where I bore the fourth generation of a ranching family . My people live where hardpan and sagebrush flats give way to the Missouri River Breaks , a country so harsh and wild and distant that it must grow its own replacements , as it grows its own food , or it will die . Hereford cattle grow slick and mean foraging along the cutbanks for greasewood shoots and buffalo grass . Town lies an hour or more north over gumbo roads . Our town was Malta , population 2,500 , county seat of Phillips County , Montana , and the largest settlement for nearly one hundred miles in any direction . // " Get tough , " my father snapped as I dragged my feet at the edge of a two-acre potato field . He gave me a gunnysack and started me down the rows pulling the tough fanweed that towered over the potato plants . I was learning then the necessary lessons of weeds and seeds and blisters . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the garden when I was eight . My mother had to pry my fingers from around the handle of the hoe , she said , and she also said I was stupid not to wear a hat in the sun . But she was proud . My granddad hooted with glee when he heard about it . // " She ? s a hell of a little worker , " he said , shaking his head . I was a hell of a little worker from that day forward , and I learned to wear a hat . // I am sometimes amazed at my own children , their outrage if they are required to do the dishes twice in one week , their tender self-absorption with minor bumps and bruises . As a mom , I ? ve had to teach myself to croon over thorn scratches , admire bloody baby teeth and sponge the dirt from scraped shins . But in my mind , my mother ? s voice and that of her mother still compete for expression . " Oh for Christ ? s sake , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for a moment I struggle . For a moment I want to tell this new generation about my little brother calmly spitting out a palm full of tooth chips and wading back in to grab the biggest calf in the branding pen . I want to tell them how tough I was , falling asleep at the table with hands too sore to hold a fork , or about their grandmother , who cut off three fingers on the blades of a mower and finished the job before she came in to get help . For a moment I ? m terrified I ? ll slip and tell them to get tough . // Like my parents and grandparents , I was born and trained to live there . I could rope and ride and jockey a John Deere as well as my brothers , but being female , I also learned to bake bread and can vegetables and reserve my opinion when the men were talking . When a bachelor neighbor began courting me when I was fifteen , my parents were proud and hopeful . Though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers were very promising . He and his father ran five hundred cow- calf pairs and five hundred head of yearlings on 36,000 acres of range . // After supper one spring evening , my mother and I stood in the kitchen . She held her back stiff as her hands shot like pistons into the mound of bread dough on the counter . I stood tough beside her . On the porch , John had presented my father with a bottle of whiskey and was asking Dad ? s permission to marry me . I wanted her to grab my cold hand and tell me how to run . I wanted her to smooth the crumpled letter from the garbage can and read the praise of my high school principal . I wanted her to tell me what I could be . // She rounded the bread neatly and efficiently and began smoothing lard over the top , intent on her fingers as they tidied the loaves . // " He ? s a good man , " she said finally . // In the seventh grade , my daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from horse to bicycle , from boot-cut Levi ? s to acid-washed jeans . She delighted me with her discoveries . Knowing little of slumber parties , roller skates or packs of giggling girls , sometimes I was more her peer than her parent . She wrote , too , long sentimental stories about lost puppies that found homes and loving two-parent families with adventurous daughters . Her characters were usually right back where they started , rescued and happy , by the end of the story . She ? d begun watching television . // " Do you hate Daddy ? " she asked once , from the depths of a divorced child ? s sadness . // " Your daddy , " I replied , " is a good man . " // In the manner of good ranchmen , my father and John squatted on their haunches on the porch facing each other . The whiskey bottle rested on the floor between them . John ? s good white shirt was buttoned painfully around his neck . Dad had pushed his Stetson back , and a white band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangely delicate . When I moved to the doorway , their conversation was shifting from weather and cattle to marriage . As Dad tilted back heavily on one heel to drink from the neck of the bottle , John looked down and began to plot our life with one finger in the dust on the floor . // " I been meaning to stop by . . . , " John said to the toe of his boot . He looked up to catch Dad ? s eye . Dad nodded and looked away . // " You figured a spot yet ? " He spoke deliberately , weighing each word . Like all the big ranches out there , John ? s place had been pieced together from old homesteads and small farms turned back to grass . // " Morgan place has good buildings , " John replied , holding Dad ? s gaze for a moment . He shifted the bottle to his lips and passed it back to Dad . // " Fair grass on the north end , but the meadows need work , " Dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the west through the screen door . The setting sun was balanced on the blue tips of the pines in the distance . He worked at the stiffness of his collar , leaving gray smudges of dust along his throat . Settling back , he spoke with a touch of defiance . // " If a person worked it right . . . " Then his eyes found his boots again . He held his head rigid , waiting . // Dad smoothed one hand along his jaw as if in deep thought , and the two men squatted silently for several minutes . Then Dad drew a long breath and blew it out . // " Old Morgan used to get three cuttings in a rain year , " he said at last . John ? s head rose and he met my father ? s steady look . // " A person might make a go of it , " John agreed softly . Dad ? s shoulders lifted slightly and dropped in mock defeat . He placed a hand on each knee and pushed himself up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grinning . Twisting suddenly , Dad reached down and grabbed the whiskey . He held it high in a toast , then leaned forward and tapped John ? s chest with the neck of the bottle . // " And you , you cocky sonofabitch ! Don ? t you try planting anything too early , understand ? " They were still laughing when they entered the kitchen . // I talk to my father twice a year now , on Christmas and Father ? s Day . We talk about the yearling weights and the rain , or the lack of rain . When I moved away from our community , my parents lost a daughter , but they will have John forever , as a neighbor , a friend . He is closer to them in spirit than I am in blood , and shares their bewilderment and anger at my rejection of their way of life . As the ultimate betrayal , I have taken John ? s sons , interrupting the perfect rites of passage . The move was hardest on the boys , for here they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they mourned this loss of prestige . // " I used to drive tractor for my dad , " the elder son once told his friends , and they scoffed . " You ? re only eleven years old , " they laughed , and he was frustrated to bitter tears . He would go back to the ranch , that one . He would have to . But he returned there an outsider , as his father knew he would . He did not stay . The first son of the clan to cross the county line and survive found it easier to leave a second time , when he had to . Had he chosen to spend his life there , he would have had memories of symphonies and tennis shoes and basketball . When he marries and has children , he will raise them knowing that , at least sometimes , cowboys do cry . // I stuck with the bargain sealed on my parents ? porch for more than twelve years , although my faith in martyrdom as a way of life dwindled . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women collected dress patterns and ceramic owls . It was hard to shine when all the good things had already been done . Dorothy crocheted tissue covers and made lampshades from Styrofoam egg cartons . Pearle looped thick , horrible rugs from rags and denim scraps . Helen gardened a half acre of land and raised two hundred turkeys in her spare time . And everyone attended the monthly meetings of the Near and Far Club to answer roll call with her favorite new recipe . // These were the successful ranchwomen who moved from barn to kitchen to field with patient , tireless steps . For nearly ten years , I kept up with the cycles of crops and seasons and moons , and I did it all well . I excelled . But in the end , I couldn ? t sleep . I quit eating . It wasn ? t enough . // I saved for three years and bought my typewriter from the Sears and Roebuck catalogue . I typed the first line while the cardboard carton lay around it in pieces . I wrote in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the keys thick and rich with ink . At first I only wrote at night when the children and John slept , emptying myself onto the paper until I could lie down . Then I began writing during the day , when the men were working in the fields . The children ran brown and wild and happy . The garden gave birth and died with rotting produce fat under its vines . The community buzzed . Dorothy offered to teach me how to crochet. // One day John ? s father , furious because lunch for the hay crew was late , took my warm , green typewriter to the shop and killed it with a sledgehammer. // A prescribed distance of beige plush separated us . On a TV monitor nearby , zigzag lines distorted our images . John ? s face looked lean and hard . My face showed fear and exhaustion . The years were all there in black and white . Mike , our marriage counselor , stood behind the video camera adjusting the sound level . We were learning to communicate , John and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a list of priority topics we had prepared for this day . Our job was to discuss them on camera . Next week we would watch our debate and learn what areas needed improvement . We talked by turns , neither allowed to interrupt the other , for three minutes on each topic . // John was indignant , bewildered by my topics . I , on the other hand , could have written his list myself . Somewhere in a dusty file drawer is a film of an emaciated , haggard woman hesitantly describing her needs and dreams to a tight- jawed man who twists his knuckles and shakes his head because he wants to interrupt her and he can ? t . His expression shows that he doesn ? t know this woman ; she ? s something he never bargained for . When it ? s over , they are both shaking and glad to get away . // " John , " Mike once asked , " how often do you tell your wife that you love her ? " // " Oh , I ? ve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I cut into the conversation from my corner of the ring . // " You only told me you loved me once , and that was the day we were married , " I said . // " Well , " John said , injured and defensive , " I never took it back , did I ? " // The break , when it came , was so swift and clean that I sometimes dream I went walking in the coulee behind the ranch house and emerged on the far side of the mountains . It ? s different here  --  not easier , but different . And it ? s enough . //
