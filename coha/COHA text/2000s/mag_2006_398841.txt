Section : WHO 'S NEXT 2007 MUSIC : He brought soul and spirituality back to hip-hop . Is there anything he ca n't do ? <p> In person , Lonnie Rashid Lynn Jr . is a soft-spoken man who prays before each meal  --  a mix of Christian , Buddhist and Muslim rituals  --  and speaks lovingly of writing children 's books . This may come as a surprise to people who know him professionally as Common , the Isaac Hayes-cool rapper who brought groove , soul and stealth sexuality back to hip-hop . Then again , maybe not . Common is , after all , the street-smart dude from the South Side of Chicago who has made a trademark of wearing fine Italian tweed hats on his elegantly bald head . " I guess I 'm a little schizophrenic , " says Common , 34 , with a laugh . " People think I 'm laid back or even shy in person , then they see me onstage , or hear me on my records , and it 's , like , Who is that guy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that question in the new year . Common will costar with none other than Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe next fall in " American Gangster , " Ridley Scott 's film about New York City cops who take on a Harlem drug kingpin  --  Common is one of the bad guys , in case you 're wondering which side of his personality he 'll be tapping into . He 's also playing a villain next month in " Smokin ' Aces , " starring Jeremy Piven as a Vegas magician who snitches on the mob . " I play a thoughtful killer , and I have to say it was really fun , " says Common . " Does that scare you ? " Piven , a fan of Common 's music , personally lobbied to get him the part . " A lot of rappers ' acting cadences are a couple clicks off , " says Piven . " But Common 's right there in the pocket . He 's a natural . " <p> If all this seems as if Common is going Hollywood  --  did we mention his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took him 13 years and six albums to break through , so he 's not about to throw all that hard work away for a little red-carpet action . The rapper is fully aware of the underground following that propped him up in the early days , and many of those discerning fans are still around . " In the beginning , only a select group was paying attention to me , " he says . " Cats would come up to me and say , ' Man , you ai n't getting the love that you deserve . ' I 'd say , ' Do n't sweat it , man , it 's gon na come . The fact that you even know about me means it 's already happening ' . " <p> That love was quadrupled and squared in 2005 with the release of " Be , " an album saturated in social commentary and deep spirituality . Common 's salt-of-the-earth approach is one of the things that made him stand out in the bling-obsessed rap world . It 's hard to remember the last time we heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love and brotherhood . " Preaching turns people off , " says Common . " When you want to deliver the message , let it live through example . Do n't beat people over the head with it . It 's like eating healthy food  --  you want it to taste good . You ca n't just give them a meal with no flavor . You 've got to add that sauce . " <p> Next on Common 's menu : " Finding Forever , " one of 2007 's most anticipated releases . The CD , coproduced by his friend and mentor Kanye West , is due out in June . Common says it 's a mix of vintage soul , progressive jazz and what he calls " futuristic boom bap . " West has already proclaimed that it 's the best rap album of the year  --  and the year has n't even started . " I 'd be lying if I said I do n't want to sell millions and become a household name , but I wo n't lose myself to do it , " says Common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who do n't love the music . It 's become the new dope game  --  they 're in it to make money . If they could obtain that same kind of money or fame by dancing on one leg like a fool , they 'd be doing that . " <p> The rapper says there 's little danger that he 'll turn his back on his music . Even if he wanted to become the new Denzel , he 's still that eclectic rapper from Chicago whom some studios are hesitant to take a chance on . " I 'm in an in-between area as far as popularity goes , " he says . " Some people know Common , some people do n't . Sometimes my name gets me in the door . Or it works the other way around , and they do n't want me ' cause I 'm a rapper . My agent just told me he 's fighting to get me in because they do n't want anybody with a hip-hop background . He had to explain to them , ' He 's not your regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is buying , so cashing in on Common 's unusual appeal can be hard to resist , especially when your business manager is  --  your mother . Mahalia Hines , a former primary-school teacher , is partly behind the branding of Common , which includes his authoring three children 's books and designing his own hat line , Soji . " My mom said , ' You 've got to multitask ' , " he says . " I said , ' It 's creativity . I ca n't just flip switches . ' An album is my child  --  I have to give it the proper attention . But I 've learned how to give two , even three , children love . I just hope I do n't become one of those fathers who plays favorites . " Or one of those rappers who go Hollywood and never look back . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : SMOKIN HOT : With Alicia Keys <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : wearing his other hat rapping in Miami <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By Lorraine Ali <p>    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
