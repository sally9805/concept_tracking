The expression " sent up the river " finds its roots in New York penal history . From the early 1800s on , convicted felons from New York City were literally " sent up the river " to Sing Sing , the gloomy penitentiary perched above the banks of the Hudson River at Ossining . <p> My arrival there was July 17 , 1985 , after receiving a fifteen years to life sentence under New York state 's Rockefeller drug laws . To my eyes , when the transport bus stopped in front of the gates , the view of the river was awesome , spreading out from the prison like a smooth , still carpet . The contrast of the natural beauty of the surroundings and the daunting facade of Sing Sing was mind-boggling . Then , once inside , as the bus inched past the giant concrete wall , I looked up and saw gun towers with armed guards . Seagulls circled high above , giving the prison the look of a medieval castle . <p> In the heart of the prison complex was the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inmates ) were processed . There I , and the others with me on the bus , were taken off and steered like cattle into a holding pen . Our cuffs and chains were removed and , one by one , we were called to another room where we were reunited with our property and given our cell assignments . <p> I was assigned to B Block . With some 660 prisoners , this is reputed to be the world 's largest cellblock . To get there we had to travel past other parts of the prison . Long , concrete corridors and tunnels connected Sing Sing 's many buildings , most of which were in horrendous condition . Slabs of peeling paint hung from the ceilings . A thin film of moisture , residue from the nearby river , covered the battleship-gray walls . The smell of mildew , disinfectant , and body odor from the 2,300 men who filled the prison made me nauseated . <p> At several checkpoints along the way we stopped while guards known as turnkeys opened the steel gates that were strategically placed throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an escort officer or an authorized movement pass . About 300 yards and countless steel gates later a door swung open and I took my first steps into B Block . <p> The noise hit me like a freight train . Rap music from radios hanging on cell bars blasted throughout the tiers . Prisoners shouted at one another from across the rows of cages stacked one on top of another , four stories high . The voices of hundreds of convicts ricocheted off the steel bars , creating a thunderous din . The block resembled a giant airplane hangar full of human cargo . <p> While I stood there , stunned , another set of gates opened . A guard led us to a cell that had been converted into an office for the officer in charge . This OIC ran the daffy activities of the block and attended to the custodial upkeep of the prisoners who lived there . I was astonished by the enormity of his task . As I gazed out over the tiers , I saw prisoners running buck wild up and down the corridors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men on the other side . The place was filthy , raucous , and crowded . <p> The cell I was assigned was a windowless , fifty-four square foot solid metal cube , number W-429 . It contained a small bed with steel springs and a torn , piss-stained mattress . A toilet with an old , porcelain bowl squatted in the corner next to a small metal locker . A portable lamp with a built-in electrical outlet was clamped over the bed . Graffiti covered the walls . I threw my property sack on the floor , sat on the bed , which was more like a cot , and held my head in my hands to drown out the noise . <p> Shortly after , a guard cracked the cell gates , signaling it was time for lunch . I followed a group of prisoners to the mess hall and took my position in line . This place was as loud and confusing as the cellblock . Hundreds of prisoners , some eating , some leaving , some standing in line , filled the massive , high-ceilinged room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another coifs food tray for some bread . " Hey , motherfucker ! " he screamed in my face . " What 's wrong with you ? Do n't ever reach over my food again or I 'll kill you . " <p> I backed away and apologized . I learned quickly that this gesture , like so many others in prison , was a sign of disrespect . The subculture there carried its own set of rules , known as the " convict code , " which prisoners lived and died by . The best that a new jack could do was to learn the code as quickly as possible and pray that in the meantime his rookie mistakes would n't get him murdered . <p> One of the worst parts about life as a new jack was being checked out by all the other prisoners . Not having a crew was dangerous . The prison was infested with predators and scam artists searching for men who had n't hooked up with a gang for protection . B Block was more dangerous than the other blocks because it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prisoners in transit status knew that they would be moving out so they lived for the moment , not caring about anything or anyone . <p> The way for a new jack to protect himself was to join a crew and find safety in numbers . Some inmates joined racial gangs for protection , but you could find just about any kind of group to hang with to show that you were n't doing time solo . You 'd start by playing basketball or handball with someone , then meeting his friends . If they liked you , you became " one of the crew . " <p> I found a crew by pumping iron with two older Puerto Ricans . After we 'd worked out together a couple of times , Roberto , who was doing twenty-five years for murder , took me under his wing and showed me the ropes . He told me that it was important to always have a weapon handy in case something went down . I said I was n't looking for trouble . " It does n't matter , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want it or not . " Later that day , we were hanging out in my cell when Roberto opened his green army jacket . From the inside pocket he removed a shank  --  a six-inch sharpened piece of metal with the end wrapped in black electrical tape . He offered it to me . <p> " No , Roberto , I do n't want that . " <p> " Do n't be stupid , Tony . You got ta have something . " He looked at my locker and reached for a small box full of batteries . He snatched my laundry bag and pulled out a sweat sock . " Perfect , " he said , loading the sock with a handful of batteries and knotting the end . It became an instant blackjack . " You can use socks for a lot of different things , " he said , " from brewing coffee to smashing someone 's skull . " He placed a boot on my bed and demonstrated , raising the lethal sock over his shoulder and smashing it down on the boot . " One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I broke many heads like this , and cracked many nuts , too , " he laughed . <p> " Nuts ? " <p> " Not the kind you eat . The kind you get when you 're backed up . " <p> " Backed up ? " His explanations were starting to confuse me . <p> " Yeah , backed up because you got no pussy . " He reached for the jar of Vaseline in my locker . Instinctively my fists clenched and I looked around for a guard . Roberto grabbed another sock from my bag and filled the inside with a scoop of Vaseline . " Here , " he said , handing me the sock . " When you get lonely , all you got to do is stick your dick inside and you 'll be all right . " <p> I looked at the sock and tried to imagine fucking it . " I do n't think so , " I said shaking my head in disbelief . <p> " Look , " he said angrily . " You 'll do a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been down for a decade and have fifteen more to go ! " He was yelling now ; the veins in his neck bulged . " I did shit even I could n't believe but I had to in order to survive . Doing time will change you  --  face it . " He calmed down when he saw the look on my face . He could tell his sermon rattled me . " Just keep an open mind , Tony . It 's the only way to beat all this time you got ta do . " <p> I 'd never thought about time and its consequences . In the street , " time " was a relative concept , flowing in and out like the tide . Sometimes you had more , sometimes less . Here , it controlled you , grabbed you by the throat and made you hyperaware of your existence . Roberto spent many hours educating me about doing time . His lessons probably saved my life . <p> One day , he asked me if I 'd do his laundry for him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer . " He waved a finger in my face . " You never do nobody 's laundry . " Doing someone 's laundry was the first step toward becoming his punk , he said . <p> I remained on good terms with Roberto and his Latino crew but , despite having a crew , danger still existed . Much of the danger was brought on by drugs . Sing Sing was awash in them . And where there are drugs , there 's violence . Different crews would fight each other over distribution turf . I tried to keep a low profile but learned that what Roberto had said was true : trouble has a way of finding you in prison , whether you 're looking for it or not . To survive in this environment I had to become comfortable with violence . I was n't a violent person on the outside , but I learned that violence was deeply imbedded in the prison culture , where the strong preyed on the weak . Either you defended yourself or you were victimized , plain and simple . It could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard when a young blond-headed guy complimented me on my sunglasses . I made the mistake of letting him try them on . A week later I was walking through the block when I ran into the same guy . He was leaning against the steam pipes with two other prisoners . <p> Casually , he walked over and stepped in front of me , blocking my path . He took a broken , rusty razor blade out of his pocket and waved it in front of my face . " I want those sunglasses , motherfucker , " he said . Because I 'd let him try on my sunglasses , he figured I was easy prey and now he was testing me . <p> My friend Roberto had taught me to look at the size of the weapon before reacting . As a rule of thumb , if the weapon was n't deadly , you should fight back at all costs . If you did n't , word spread that you were a coward , which meant that your ass would be on the line with others . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay to run but always return with an equal-sized weapon . <p> I looked at the razor blade . It was less than an inch long . It could n't kill me , I figured . I made my choice and looked square into the guy 's face . I was ready to fight because I knew that my survival at Sing Sing depended on it . If I let him take my glasses , I 'd be pegged a pussy . The predators would find out and make my life more hellish than it already was . " Use that , " I growled , " and I 'll kill you . " I stared him down with pure hatred in my eyes , thinking about how I 'd fucked up my entire life , lost my family , and now I 'd be spending my best fifteen years in this rat hole . The piece-of-crap con must have seen the fire in my eyes and everything that was behind it . He quickly put away the blade and tried to make a joke out of it . I walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn that I could get out of most situations simply by feigning toughness , or " fronting , " as prisoners say , putting on a certain face or using certain words and speaking with absolute conviction . There were times , however , when violence was unavoidable . Often it boiled down to being in the wrong place at the wrong time . <p> One day I was walking the flats , the ground-level area of the block , when I saw this guy Nicky whom I knew from the weight room . At 6 ' 2 ? and 240 pounds of solid muscle , Nicky was a monster . The week before , he 'd noticed my sneakers and asked me what size they were . " Ten , " I said . Funny , he wore the same size , too . Since I 'd once seen Nicky whack a guy over the head with a forty-pound dumbbell just for looking at him the wrong way , I figured it 'd be a good idea to get on his good side . I told him I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 'd nodded and thanked me . <p> The next day , Nicky spotted me at the rear of the cellblock and motioned me over to him . As I got closer I noticed that his face wore a strange expression and his eyes were bloodshot . From his breath I could tell he was drunk on jailhouse wine . " Give me your sneakers , " he demanded . <p> " I did n't get my new ones yet , " I said . <p> " You think I give a shift ? " Before I could answer , he unleashed a powerful upper cut that caught me square under my chin . I sailed backwards to the floor  --  and my sneakers came off ! He hit me so hard I literally flew out of my sneakers . To this day , I do n't know whether they 'd been untied and flew off from the impact or if he 'd knocked me unconscious long enough to yank them off my feet . Whatever the case , shortly after hitting the floor , I popped back up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget about it . No one wanted to start trouble with a guy like Nicky . Besides , people said he went crazy every so often , usually when he was high or drunk . If I left it alone , Nicky would be fine with me , they said . It was good prison politics . <p> Sure enough , the advice was sound . The next day in the weight room Nicky acted like nothing had happened . " Hey Tony , what 's going on ? " he said , slapping me on the back and flashing a smile . " Thanks for the sneakers , " he said . I noticed that he was wearing them . <p> " Hey , all right , " I replied . " They fit okay ? " <p> " Sure do , man , thanks again . " <p> It was good to have guys like Nicky on your side . <p> About six months into my stay I tried to get a job as an electrician in the prison . Getting assigned to certain jobs could guarantee general population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And this would get me transferred to A Block , the main housing area . After that , I would n't have to worry about being shipped out to a possibly worse facility elsewhere in the state . <p> I went to the chapel where the administration had set up a committee to assign qualified prisoners to work assignments . I approached a counselor and said I 'd like to work as an electrician . I said I had skills to offer Sing Sing and that I wanted to spend my time doing something constructive , something that could get me a job in the real world once I got out . <p> " Look everyone , " the counselor called out . " This man wants to be rehabilitated ! " He doubled over in laughter . <p> I looked at his pudgy face , red with glee , and I thought of everything I 'd gone through to get to this sorry place , how I was standing there like a fool , begging for a job that paid pennies . This time I did n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I shot back , not bothering to disguise the hostility in my voice . " I know lots of guys in here who want to improve themselves . " A few heads turned . The room grew quiet . <p> " Rehabilitation does not exist , " the counselor said flatly , glowering at me . <p> " Really , " I continued . " You mean to tell me that your job amounts to nothing more than locking people up ? You do n't believe in giving prisoners a chance to do something constructive with their time ? " <p> He did n't respond . I knew I should 've kept my mouth shut , but I was sick of the crap . All the prison was good for was warehousing men , infantilizing them , and then churning them out like so many widgets on the day of their release . I stepped closer to read his nametag . " Mr. Cody , " it said . He was a civilian employee , not a cop . Fuck it , I thought , feeling empowered for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cody , " I said , enunciating both syllables in his name . " With that kind of attitude maybe you should n't be a counselor . " <p> He stared at me hard and tapped his pen nervously on the desk . I decided to back down . " Look , man , I 'm sorry . I got a family to support . I could really use a job . " <p> " I do n't have a job for you , " he said , his voice rising . " Now get out ! " <p> As I left , a counselor sitting in the rear of the chapel got up and walked out with me . He introduced himself as Dennis Manwaring , the Special Subjects Supervisor . " I heard what you said about your family , " he said . " Why do n't you come by my office tomorrow morning and we 'll see what we can do . " I looked in his eyes and I trusted him . <p> The next day , after a brief interview , Dennis signed the necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , I was staying at Sing Sing . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Metamorphosis , 1991 <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Nightmare of Justice , 1988 <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : After the Whitney , 1994 <p> By Anthony Papa and Jennifer Wynn <p> <p> While in prison , Anthony Papa became an award-winning artist and received clemency in 1996 from Governor George Pataki .
