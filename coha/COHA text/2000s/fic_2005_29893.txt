A Taste of Crimson By Marjorie M. Liu Dorchester Publishing Marjorie M. Liu The Man was around , which meant that Keeli had to slip out of Butchies through the back , leaving Shelly in the weeds with five tables , one of which had been screaming for their fries just before that familiar starched white shirt ghosted through the front doors . " H.I . Bob is here , " Shelly whispered , and just like that , Keeli had to drop everything and dodge . Health Inspector Bob , aka The Man . A man who had a distinct disliking for werewolves . He had already fined Jim Butchie three hundred dollars for keeping Keeli on as a waitress . Not that werewolves were the reason cited , but it did n't have to be . The Man had a reputation , and every other restaurant in the city - the ones that did n't discriminate - had suffered from his twitchy fingers and high fines . Blame it on a new law from the Feds , which now required the Food and Health industry to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggressive " diseases . Employers were n't supposed to discriminate based on blood-test results - that , at least , was still illegal - but enforcement was a joke . Humans were running scared nowadays . Or at least , a little nervous . Keeli was lucky - she still had a job . Even the most progressive restaurants fired their non-humans servers after a run-inwith the Man . Of course , most restaurants were n't owned and run by Jim Butchie , an ex-trucker who embodied the two most sacred words in Keeli 's vocabulary : fuck you . Butchies was a greasy hole situated in the armpit of east downtown , the round and smelly fringe of the city . Good cheap food , and open twenty-four hours a day . Jim lived above his restaurant and could always be counted on to poke his nose into everyone 's business , at every hour of the day . Jim did n't seem to need much sleep . One of the busboys had probably gone up to his apartment by now and told him about H.I . Bob . Keeli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's back door . The smell was overwhelming , but she did n't move . She listened to the dishwashers in the pit . Young men , new to the country , chattering in a patois of Spanish , Chinese , and English that had become common in the lower classes . Keeli spoke it fluently . She cleaned her fingernails to kill time , scraping out bits of food from beneath her long nails . She hated the feel of grease on her skin , her odor after a night on the job . The scent of wolf , drowned out by the scent of fries and hamburgers . It could be worse . At least you have a job . You work in a place where the people like you . Yes . She had nothing to complain about . Not like the rest of her clan , especially the men , many of whom were finding it difficult to land even grunt work . Everyone in this part of town knew each other 's business - especially if you were fang or fur . And no one was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street that they 're lined up for shit , and suddenly life becomes difficult for all of us . And it was only going to get worse . Everyone in the underground knew about the human attack on the vampires . Rumor called it a rogue element , but that was shit , just some lame excuse . Keeli did n't imagine for one instant the humans would stop at just the vampires . The only surprise was that the werewolves had n't been targeted first . When it came to pure visceral reaction , wolves usually got the boot up the ass before the fangs . We just are n't sexy enough . Keeli glanced down at her striped stockings , her scuffed Doc Martins . Her torn black T-shirt barely covered her lean midriff , and her spiked hair had been dyed a fresh shade of pink just that morning . Yeah , she radiated sex appeal . Not . Of course , that was the way she wanted it . She was sick of expectations . She heard Jim 's voice over the clanging pots and running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , H.I . Bob said something nasal , irritating . Hackles raised , Keeli edged deeper into the shadow cast by the dumpster . The alley was poorly lit , but she always had trouble judging what humans could see or hear , and she never underestimated others . A dangerous thing , her grandmother had taught her . Arrogance leaves you vulnerable . Vulnerable . Something Keeli had vowed to never let herself be . She shifted , stretching cramped muscles . She did not like sitting still for long periods of time - it was the wolf in her , the need to run , to feel the ground beneath her feet , the rush of air in her hair , against her skin , drawing out each breath like it was her last living moment in the world - Keeli sagged against the wall , savoring the cool damp brick . Her fingernails felt too sharp . The wolf rolled within her chest , close to the surface . Too close . Jim 's voice got loud and then receded , followed quickly by H.I . Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retreat was near an end . She 'd have to go back in soon . She had responsibilities , tables waiting . Shelly needed help . Keeli swallowed hard . It would be so easy to walk away from all this . But if she did , all her work - the slow process of proving her self-control to the clan and her grandmother - would be worth nothing . She could not allow that . She was finally making her own way , defying expectation . Nothing was worth losing that independence . At the end of the alley , she heard a sudden burst of laughter . Men , drunk . Keeli 's lip curled . There were a lot of bars in east downtown , with patrons of the human and werewolf variety . The only difference was that werewolves rarely drank enough to become intoxicated . Too much risk . Control over the wolf could be a tenuous thing - for some wolves more than others . And let 's face it - no one likes a drunk , wolf or not . Especially when they sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peering at the alley mouth . Butchies 's back door was close to the main drag , so Keeli had a fine view of the sidewalk . She heard the men coming , sounding four strong . A stumbling walk , alternating pace from fast to slow . A pause ; the sound of a zipper . Piss . More laughter . I 'll have to remind myself not to walk that way after my shift . I have to deal with enough awful smells . From the other direction , a new sound . Soft soles . A light quick tread . Woman . What shitty timing . Keeli 's stomach tightened as the woman drew near . She would have seen the men by now , who were still motionless , loudly comparing the size of their dicks . " Turn around , " Keeli breathed . " Come on , lady . Common sense . " Keeli listened hard , heard a shift in the woman 's gait . It faded slightly , but not enough . Not enough . She crossed the street . The laughter stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman on the other side of the street , walking quickly , almost stumbling over her feet . A short bulky figure wrapped in a long coat . Curls , blond and bouncing . Still , silence . Keeli held her breath . Maybe these guys were n't shit , maybe they would let her go . Maybe - The whistles began . Even as Keeli stepped away from the shadows , moving toward the alley mouth , she heard more laughter , low and hard . A growl rose up in her throat . " Sweet , " said one man , and another murmured , " Come on . " Keeli burst from the alley just in time to see the men take off after the woman . Drunk , but quick : they crossed the street in seconds and ran down the woman . A circle of arms , rough hands ; she screamed . And then Keeli was there and the wolf was high in her throat , clawing at her skin , roping muscle , bone ; a terrible strength , and the fury was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunger . She burst into the circle of men , breaking them apart with sharp kicks , biting nails into flesh . Close up , they smelled like the docks ; fish and machine grease , mixed with alcohol . Big men , taller than her by a foot , with shoulders thick and broad . Keeli slammed her foot into a kneecap - savored the sharp crack , the scream torn from the man 's throat . Hands wrapped around her waist . Keeli grabbed meaty fingers and yanked back ; they snapped and she tightened her grip , twisting , grinding broken bone . Her assailant 's screams made her eardrums vibrate . He tried to wrench free , hauling Keeli off her feet . She tucked her knees to her chest and refused to let go . When he whirled near one of his wide-eyed friends , she kicked out , landing a boot heel into the man 's chin . Fur pressed though her skin , sleek as her rage , consuming her body as she sank deeper into fire . Yes , she thought . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man trapped against her screamed even louder . Keeli released him and fell to her feet . Her claws scraped concrete . The men ran - this time , away - but in two quick steps Keeli captured a straggler . Strong - the wolf in her was strong - and she slammed him into the ground , wrenching his left arm behind his back . Canines slid gentle against her lip , jaw narrowing , jutting sharp . Keeli lowered her head . She felt a presence , then , at her side . Strong hands grabbed a fistful of her hair and yanked hard . Keeli did not think ; she whirled , snarling , and sank her teeth into flesh . Blood filled her mouth , hot and bitter . It tasted good . And then - oh , oh , fucking shit what have I done - the blood turned sour and she ripped her head away , gasping . Gone too far , too far . She had bitten a human - and oh , if not one then how about another , because she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood - and there was still a man beneath her , the man she had been going to kill - and the old rage felt so damn good - Keeli leaned over and vomited . Again , she felt hands in her hair , gentler this time . " It 's all right , " whispered a man , in a voice so dark , Keeli shuddered . Her gaze slid sideways and slowly , slowly , up . Sagging leather boots filled her vision , and then black silk robes - reminiscent of old Asia - belted tight around a narrow waist , hugging a lean chest and bony shoulders . A pale striking face , with more bone than flesh , framed by loose black hair threaded with braids . His right cheek glittered . And his eyes ... Keeli stared for one precious moment , lost in the velvet underground of that deep-set gaze . And then a click - the recognition of Something Not Quite Right , and she realized what he was , and what she had bitten . Relief made her weak , as did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another fresh swell of inexplicable rage . " Vampire , " she growled , embarrassed at how her voice broke on that one word . " Get the hell away from me . " " No , " he said , so calm , quiet . As though the warmth dripping on her hand , the blood from his torn arm , meant nothing . Her bite , meaningless . " Not until you release the human . " The man beneath her trembled . She smelled piss , sour sweat . His friends were long gone . He was all she had left , and the wolf still wanted him dead . One bite , a break in his neck . He would never hurt anyone again . Never again . No one 's ever going to get hurt again . " You must calm yourself , " whispered the vampire , as though he could read her thoughts . He bent so close they brushed noses . Keeli froze . " Please . Control the wolf . You have witnesses . " It was the ' please ' that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his voice . Her gaze darted sideways . Jim , Shelly , and a handful of strangers stood a short distance away . Everyone but Jim stared at her with eyes that seemed too full of shock , numb horror , to ever fade away into a forgivable memory . Shelly had her arms wrapped around the victim of the attempted rape , her straight red bob pressed against blond curls . Jim stood over them both . He looked worried . Shame burned away the rest of Keeli 's rage , sending the wolf on swift retreat . Everything she had worked for - trying so hard to fit in - to be , for once , more woman than wolf - " This is not how you wish humans to remember your kind , " whispered the vampire , still close . His cheek shimmered ; round lines , etched in gold . For the first time , Keeli noticed his scent . Dry , with a hint of wild grass , horse hair . The taint of age . " This is not how you wish them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still holding down the shivering man . She was fully human again . Pink skin , clear nails . She let go of her captive and slid off his back . He continued to lie there , his eyes squeezed shut . She almost touched him - to comfort , reassure - and then memory resurfaced . " He deserved it , " she said . " Deserved to be scared , for what he was going to do to that woman . " " Maybe , " said the vampire . " But you would have given up your own life to do it . He 's not worth that . " Keeli looked at the vampire ; really looked , hard , and saw nothing but calm acceptance . No anger . She glanced down at his arm . " I 'm sorry , " she said , and it was one more shock to add to her collection : apologizing to a vampire . " Will you be all right ? " His mouth twitched . " I 've had worse . " He stood and held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Awful , disgusting . Vampires are monsters . Monsters beneath a veneer of refinement , big money . Hypocrites and fakes . Pretending to be better , more human than everyone else . Maybe this one is different . Yeah , and maybe she had n't just lost herself to the wolf . Keeli pushed away from him , scrambling to her feet . She heard sirens and found herself saying , " You should go . The cops will be here soon . They might have a mech with them . " The vampire hesitated . He glanced at Jim and the others , still hanging back , watching . " What of you ? I can carry the both of us . " Keeli shook her head . " I do n't run . Ever . " The vampire 's eyes narrowed . " And will you think I 'm a coward if I leave you ? " Why the hell am I having this conversation ? " You 're a vampire , " Keeli said . " I already think you 're a coward . Amongst other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mouth . " Good-bye , wolf . " " The name is Keeli , fang-boy . " " Michael . And I 'm not the only one with fangs . " He reached out , a blur , and brushed Keeli 's lips with cool fingertips . She was too surprised to say a word - surprised at the gentleness of his touch , surprised at her reaction to it . She saw blood on his fingers ; he had wiped her mouth . " When they ask , you did not bite anyone , " he said quietly , and then leapt into the air - up and up - a shadow passing into shadow , into the night , until he was gone . Not even an outline against the dim stars . " Thanks for helping me , " she murmured . The sirens were loud now , eardrum-shattering . She looked at Jim and Shelly ; the weeping woman , her weeping attacker . Keeli squared her shoulders and prepared herself for a long and difficult night . ( Continues ... ) by Marjorie M.
