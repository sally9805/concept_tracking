Chapter One ACT ONE , SCENE ONE , the Storyteller thought to himself , and could n't hold back a dizzying rush of anticipation . The truth was that ordinary people committed perfect crimes and perfect murders all the time . But you did n't hear about it for the simple reason that the killers never got caught . And neither would he , of course . That was a given in the story he was about to tell . Which did n't mean that today was n't nerve-racking . Actually , this was the most intense moment in the past couple of insane years for him . He was ready to kill somebody , a complete stranger , and he had figured out that New York City was the right place for his first . It almost happened just outside a basement restroom in Bloomingdale 's , but he did n't feel right about the location . Too crowded , even at half past ten in the morning . Too noisy , and yet not noisy enough to provide the proper distraction . Plus , he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unfamiliar territory of Lexington Avenue , or especially down into the claustrophobic IRT subway tunnels . When it felt right , he 'd know it , and act accordingly . So the Storyteller moved on and decided to catch a flick at the Sutton Theater on East 57th Street , a funky , run-down place that had obviously seen better days . Maybe this was a good place for a murder . He liked the irony , even if he was the only one who got it . Yes , maybe this was going to work out great , he thought as he sat in one of the two small auditoriums inside . He began to watch Kill Bill Volume 2 with seven other Tarantino aficionados . Which one of these unsuspecting people would be his victim ? You ? You ? You there ? The Storyteller spun the tale inside his head . There were two loudmouths in identical New York Yankees baseball caps , worn backward , of course . The irritating morons did n't shut up once through the interminable ads and trailers . They both deserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who did n't talk to each other at all , not once in fifteen minutes before the houselights went down . Killing them would be a good deed , almost a public service . A fragile-looking woman , early forties , seemed to be having the shakes two rows in front of the moldy oldies . Bothering no one-except him . And then a big black dude with his sneakered feet up on the seat in front of him . Rude , inconsiderate bastard in his old-school Converses that must have been at least size fourteens . Next , a black-bearded movie nerd who probably had seen the movie a dozen times already and worshipped Quentin Tarantino , of course . Turned out , it was the bearded wonder who got up about halfway through the movie , just after Uma Thurman was buried alive . Jesus , who could walk out on that classic scene ? Duty-bound , he followed , a couple of seconds behind . Out into the dingy hall , then into the men 's room , which was located near theater two . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? His first murder ? The beginning of everything he 'd dreamed about for months ? Make that years . He was pretty much on autopilot , trying not to think about anything except doing this right , then getting in and out of the movie theater without anybody noticing his face or too much else about him . The bearded guy was standing at the urinal , which was kind of good news , actually . The shot was nicely framed and art-directed . Wrinkled , grungy black T-shirt that said NYU FILM SCHOOL with a clapsticks logo on the back . Reminded him of a character out of a Daniel Clowes comic book , and that graphic shit was hot right now . " And ... action ! " he said . Then he shot the poor bearded loser in the back of the head , watched him drop like a heavy sack to the bathroom floor . Lie there-nothing moving . The blast roared through his head in the tiled room , louder than he 'd dreamed it would be . " Hey-what the ? What happened ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around as if there was an audience watching him in the men 's room . Two guys from the Sutton Theater crew had entered behind him . They must have been curious about the noise . And how much had they seen ? " Heart attack , " he said , blurted it out , tried to sound convincing . " Man just fell over at the urinal . Help me get him up . Poor guy . He 's bleeding ! " No panic , no affect , no second thoughts whatsoever . Everything was pure instinct now , right , wrong , or indifferent . He raised his gun and shot both theater workers as they stood walleyed and dorky at the door . He shot them again when they were down on the floor . Just to be careful . Professional . And now he was really shaking , legs like J-E-L-L-O , but trying to walk very calmly out of the men 's room . Then out of the Sutton Theater onto 57th , heading east on foot . Everything outside feeling completely unreal and otherworldly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 'd killed three people instead of just one . His first three murders . It was just practice , but he 'd done it , and you know what ? He could do it again . " Practice makes perfect , " the Storyteller whispered under his breath as he hurried toward his car-his getaway car , right ? God , this was the best feeling of his life . Of course , that did n't say much for his life up to now , did it ? But watch out from here on , just watch out . For Mary , Mary , quite contrary . Of course , he was the only one who got that . So far , anyway . ( Continues ... )
