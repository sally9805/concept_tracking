Step inside this confortable retreat with its fabulous views of the North Carolina mountains . // This Charlotte couple spent several years scouting their home state for the perfect spot to locate a mountain retreat . Then they spent another two years deciding on a plan . " We wanted relative proximity to Charlotte , privacy , and a big view , " recalls one of the owners . They found the expansive vistas and privacy they sought atop Summit Ridge , just a 2 1/2-hour winding drive from Charlotte , overlooking the quaint town of Banner Elk . Inspiration for the plan came on a family vacation to Glacier National Park . The couple was charmed by the simple beauty of Montana 's national park lodges , including Lake McDonald Lodge , built in 1913 . The visit left them yearning to cocoon in the rustic elegance and charming details of lodgestyle living year-round . Architect Mark Paullin and designer Missy Luczak of the Charlotte-based architectural and design firm Meyer Greeson Paullin Architecture helped the couple recreate a rough-hewn look and feel in this comfortable mountain setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " say the owners . " He had spent a great deal of time in Montana and had a great feel for the mountains , the style we wanted , and a sense of building something that really fits in with the site . " The original plan was to construct the house up against the road , until the owners pointed out a cliff at the back of the lot where they envisioned a picnic area . The rock cliff was such a picturesque spot that both Mark and builder Matthew Collins agreed they should put the house there . Dropped back about a third of the way into the lot , the form of the house was designed to follow the natural topography . Now , it appears to be an extension of the rocky cliff on which it 's perched rather than a manmade structure .

Mossy green and sunny yellow fabrics mix with fiery reds and bronzy browns that reflect the changing seasons . Truly , the design is such that even if the natural palettes , wonderfully rustic surfaces , and architectural elements do n't lull you into believing you 're outdoors , one of the many windows will . " We knew that we could n't re-create a 100-year-old lodge , but what we could do was give a feeling of age by using wood everywhere , " says Mark . Painted V-groove paneled walls , large pine trusses , and hardwood floors blend with the stonework . Handcrafted details complement natural stains on the wood , and an abundance of glass takes full advantage of the views .

" We really focused the majority of the common area 's design around the fireplace , " says designer Missy Luczak . A handcrafted staircase creates a vestibule just inside the front door . // The interior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ omnipresent , breathtaking view is also.by design . Multiple tables and sink-in seating are positioned toward western-facing windows where mountains become awash in the brilliance of the setting sun . Windows to the east look to seasonal beds of shrubs or flowers where wildlife comes to graze . Upstairs , the master suite allows for comfortable hibernation . The space is tucked under the eaves , and the downy bed rests under a series of eyebrow windows . Downstairs , a finished basement houses four additional bedrooms and a game room . When the couple is home alone , the family room , dining room , kitchen , and master suite become one living space-ensuring that the expansive five-bedroom house lives much smaller . " The house functions incredibly well , whether it 's just us there alone for the weekend or we have a houseful of company , " say the owners . A welcoming foyer opens to the living and dining rooms . " Lake McDonald Lodge has a wonderful two-story common area with a great stone fireplace and a balcony that we really loved , " says one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mimic that look with rustic wooden beams looming overhead and a stone fireplace as the focal point . The custom dining table stands beside a wall of windows to take advantage of the spectacular view . " I shopped for that piece forever . Then I finally gave up , designed the table myself , and had it made locally , " says Missy . " The table was modeled after an old trestle table I saw in an antiques store , " she says . The dark walnut finish was matched from a set of antique chairs , and a distressed finish gives the piece an appropriately aged appearance .

An antique table pulls up to the banquette , and just outside , a wraparound porch affords many places to enjoy the view . " I chose teak furniture for the porch because it will weather like stone and turn a silvery gray to match the teak railings , " says Missy . " Virtually anywhere you sit in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's something to look at architecturally or simply what the window is fining outside , " say the homeowners .

A patio perch and leafless trees afford those who brave the cold a breathtaking view . // <p>
