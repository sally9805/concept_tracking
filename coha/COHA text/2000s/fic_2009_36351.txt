Always a Bloody Ghost <p> " Tosser ! " Cried the raven . <p> There 's always a bloody raven . <p> " Foolish teachin ' him to talk , if you ask me , " said the sentry . <p> " I 'm duty-bound foolish , yeoman . " said I. I am , you know ? A fool . Fool to the court of Lear of Britain . " And you are a tosser , " I said . <p> " Piss off ! " said the raven . <p> The yeoman took a swipe at the bird with his spear and the great black bird swooped off the wall and went cawing out over the Thames . A ferryman looked up from his boat , saw us on the tower , and waved . I jumped onto the wall and bowed - at your fucking service , thank you . The yeoman grumbled and spit after the raven . <p> There have always been ravens at the White Tower . A thousand years ago , before George the 2nd , idiot King of Merica , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legend says that as long as there are ravens at the Tower , England will stand strong . Still , it may have been a mistake to teach one to talk . <p> " The Earl of Gloucester approaches ! " Cried a sentry on the west wall . " With his son Edgar and the bastard Edmund ! " <p> The yeoman by me grinned . " Gloucester , eh ? Be sure you do that bit where you play a goat and Drool plays the Earl mistaking you for his wife . " <p> " That would be unkind , " said I. " the Earl is newly widowed . " <p> " You did it the last time he was here and she was still warm in the grave . " <p> " Well , yes . A service that - trying to shock the poor wretch out of his grief , was n't I ? " <p> " Good show , too . The way you was bleatin ' I thought ol ' Drool was givin ' it to you right proper up the bung . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall when opportunity presented . <p> " Heard he was going to have you assassinated , but he could n't make a case to the King . " <p> " Gloucester 's a noble , he does n't need a case for murder , just a whim and a blade . " <p> " Not bloody likely , " the yeoman said , " everyone knows the King 's got a wing o'er you . " <p> That was true . I enjoy a certain license . <p> " Have you seen , Drool ? With Gloucester here , there 'll be a command performance . " My apprentice , Drool - a beef-witted bloke the size of a draught horse . <p> " He was in the kitchen before the watch , " said the yeoman . <p> The kitchen buzzed - the staff preparing for a feast . <p> " Have you seen Drool ? " I asked Taster , who sat at the table staring sadly at a bread trencher laid out with cold pork , the King 's dinner . He was a thin , sickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of constitution , and a predisposition toward dropping dead at the slightest provocation . I liked to tell him my troubles , sure that they would not travel far . <p> " Does this look poisoned to you ? " <p> " It 's pork , lad . Lovely . Eat up . Half the men in the England would give a testicle to feast thus , and it only mid-day . I 'm tempted myself . " I tossed my head - gave him a grin and a bit of a jingle on the ol ' hat bells to cheer him . I pantomimed stealing a bit of his pork . " After you , of course . " <p> A knife thumped into the table by my hand . <p> " Back , Fool , " said Bubble , the head cook . " That 's the King 's lunch and I 'll have your balls before I 'll let you at it . " <p> " My balls are yours for the asking , milady , " said I. " Would you have them on a trencher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like peaches ? " <p> Bubble harrumphed , yanked her knife from the table and went back to gutting a trout at the butcher block , her great bottom rolling like thunderclouds under her skirt as she moved . <p> " You 're a wicked little man , Pocket , " said Squeak , waves of freckles riding o'er her shy smile . She was second to the cook , a sturdy , ginger-haired girl with a high giggle and a generous spirit in the dark . Taster and I often passed pleasant afternoons at the table watching her wring the necks of chickens . <p> Pocket is my name , by the way . Given to me by the Abbess who found me on the nunnery doorstep when I was a tiny babe . True , I am not a large fellow . Some might even say I am diminutive , but I am quick as a cat and nature has compensated me with other gifts . But wicked ? <p> " I think Drool was headed to the princess 's chambers , " Squeak said . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady sent for a cure for melancholy . " <p> " And the git went ? " Jest on his own ? The boy was n't ready . What if he blundered , tripped , fell on the princess like a millstone on a butterfly ? " Are you sure ? " <p> Bubble dropped a gutless trout into a bushel of slippery cofishes . " Chanting , ' off to do ma duty ' , he was . We told him you 'd be looking for him when we heard Princess Goneril and the Duke of Albany was coming . " <p> " Albany 's coming ? " <p> " Ai n't he sworn to string your entrails from the chandelier ? " Asked Taster . <p> " No , " corrected Squeak , " That was Duke of Cornwall . Albany was going to have his head on a pike , I believe . Pike , was n't it , Bubble ? " <p> " Aye , have his head on a pike . Funny thing , thinkin ' about it , you 'd look like a bigger version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Taster , pointing to my jester 's scepter , Jones , who is , indeed , a smaller version of my own handsome countenance , fixed atop a sturdy handle of hardened hickory . Jones speaks for me when even my tongue needs to exceed safe license with knights and nobles , his head pre-piked for wrath of the dull and humorless . My finest art is oft lost in the eye of the subject . <p> " Yes , that would be right hilarious , Bubble - ironic imagery - like the lovely Squeak turning you on a spit over a fire , an apple up both your ends for color - although I daresay the whole castle might conflagrate in the resulting grease fire , but until then we 'd laugh and laugh . " <p> I dodged a well-flung trout then , and paid Bubble a grin for not throwing her knife instead . Fine woman , she , despite being large and quick to anger . " Well , I 've a great drooling dolt to find if we are to prepare an entertainment for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the north tower , the quickest way there atop the outer wall . As I crossed over the great main gate house , a young spot-faced yeoman called . " Hail , Earl of Gloucester ! " Below , the greybeard Gloucester and his retinue were crossing the drawbridge . <p> " Hail , Edmund , you bloody bastard ! " I called over the wall . <p> The yeoman tapped me on the shoulder . " Beggin ' your pardon , sirrah , but I 'm told that Edmund is sensitive about his bastardy . " <p> " Aye , yeoman , " said I. " No need for prodding and jibe to divine that prick 's tender spot , he wears it on his sleeve . " I jumped on the wall and waved Jones at the bastard , who was trying to wrench a bow and quiver from a knight who rode beside him . " You whoreson scalawag ! " Said I. " You flesh-turd dropped stinking from the poxy arsehole of a hare-lipped harlot ! " <p> The Earl of Gloucester glowered up at me as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart , that one , " said the yeoman . <p> " Too harsh then , you reckon ? " <p> " A bit . " <p> " Sorry . Excellent hat though , bastard , " I called , by way of making amends . Edgar and two knights were trying to restrain the bastard Edmund below . I jumped down from the wall . " Have n't seen Drool , have you ? " <p> " In the great hall this morning , " said the yeoman . " Not since . " <p> A call came around the top of the wall , passing from yeoman to yeoman until we heard , " The Duke of Cornwall and Princess Regan approach from the South . " <p> " Fuckstockings ! " Cornwall : polished greed and pure born villainy ; he 'd dirk a nun for a farthing , and short the coin , for the fun . <p> " Do n't worry , little one , the King ' ill keep your hide whole . " <p> " Aye , yeoman he will , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ill have you walking watch on the frozen moat all winter . " <p> " Sorry , Sir Jester , Sir , " said the yeoman . He slouched then as not to seem so irritatingly tall . " Heard that tasty Princess Regan 's a right bunny cunny , eh ? " He leaned down to elbow me in the ribs , now that we were best mates and all . <p> " You 're new , are n't you ? " <p> " Just two months in service . " <p> " Advice , then , young yeoman : When referring to the King 's middle daughter , state that she is fair , speculate that she is pious , but unless you 'd like to spend your watch looking for the box where your head is kept , resist the urge to wax ignorant on her naughty bits . " <p> " I do n't know what that means , sir . " <p> " Speak not of Regan 's shaggacity , son , Cornwall has taken the eyes of men who have but looked upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fiend ! I did n't know , sir . I 'll say nothing . " <p> " And neither shall I , good yeoman . Neither shall I. " <p> And thus are alliances made , loyalties cemented . Pocket makes a friend . <p> The boy was right about Regan , of course . And why I had n't thought to call her bunny cunny myself , when I of all people should know - well , as an artist , I must admit , I was envious of the invention . <p> Cordelia 's private solar lay at the top of the North Tower on the outer wall , up a narrow spiral staircase lit only with the crosses of arrow loops . I could hear giggling as I topped the stairs . <p> " So I am of no worth if not on the arm and in the bed of some buffoon in a cod piece ? " I heard Cordelia say . <p> " You called , " said I , stepping into the room , codpiece in hand . <p> The ladies in waiting giggled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrieked at my presence - disturbed no doubt , by my overt manliness , or perhaps by the gentle clouting on the bottom she received from Jones . <p> " Pocket ! " Cordelia sat at the center of the circle of girls - holding court , as such - her hair down , blond curls to her waist , a simple gown of lavender linen , loosely laced . She stood and approached me . " You honor us , Fool . Did you hear rumors of small animals to hurt , or were you hoping to accidently surprise me in my bath again ? " <p> I tipped my hat , a slight , contrite jingle there . " I was lost , milady . " <p> " A dozen times ? " <p> " If you want a navigator I 'll send for him , but I 'll not lend him Jones or my coxcomb . And hold me blameless should your melancholy triumph and you drown yourself in the brook , your gentle ladies weeping damply around your pale and lovely corpse . Let them say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she was in her navigator , but lost in heart for want of a fool . ' " <p> The ladies gasped as if I 'd cued them . I 'd have blessed them if I were still on speaking terms with God . <p> " Out , out , out , ladies , " Cordelia said . " Give me peace with my fool so that I might devise some punishment for him . " <p> The ladies scurried out of the room . <p> " Punishment ? " I asked . " For what ? " <p> " I do n't know yet , " she said , " but by the time I 've thought of the punishment , I 'm sure there 'll be an offense . " <p> " I blush at your confidence . " <p> " And I at your humility , " said the princess . She grinned , a crescent too devious for a maid of her tender years . Cordelia is not ten years my junior ( I 'm exactly not sure of my own age ) , seventeen summers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king 's daughters , she 's always been treated as if fragile as spun glass . But , sweet thing , her bark could frighten a mad badger . <p> " Shall I disrobe for my punishment ? " I offered . " Flagellation ? Fellation ? Whatever . I am your willing penitent , lady . <p> " No more of that , Pocket . I need your counsel , or at least your commiseration . My sisters are coming to the castle . " <p> " Unfortunately , they have arrived . " <p> " Oh , that 's right , Albany and Cornwall want to kill you . Bad luck , that . Anyway , they are coming to the castle , as is Gloucester and his sons . Goodness , they want to kill you as well . " <p> " Rough critics , " said I. <p> " Sorry . And a dozen other nobles as well as the Earl of Kent are here . Kent does n't want to kill you , does he ? " <p> " Not that I know of . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And do you know why they are all coming ? " <p> " To corner me like a rat in a barrel ? " <p> " Barrels do not have corners , Pocket . " <p> " Does seem like a lot of bother for killing one small , if tremendously handsome fool . " <p> " It 's not about you , you dolt ! It 's about me . " <p> " Well , even less effort to kill you . How many can it take to snap your scrawny neck ? I worry that Drool will do it by accident some day . You have n't seen him , have you ? " <p> " Father is marrying me off ! " <p> " Nonsense . Who would have you ? " <p> The lady darkened a bit , then , blue eyes gone cold . Badgers across Blighty shuddered . " Edgar of Gloucester has always wanted me and the Prince of France and Duke of Burgundy are already here to pay me troth . " <p> " Troth about what ? " <p> " Troth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Troth , troth , you fool , not truth . The princes are here to marry me . " <p> " Those two ? Edgar ? No . " I was shaken . Cordelia ? Married ? Would one of them take her away ? It was unjust ! Unfair ! Wrong ! Why , she had never even seen me naked . <p> " Why would they want to troth you ? I mean , for the night , to be sure , who would n't troth you cross-eyed ? But permanently , I think not . " <p> " I 'm a bloody princess , Pocket . " <p> " Precisely . What good are princesses ? Dragon food and ransom markers - spoiled brats to be bartered for real estate . " <p> " Oh no , dear fool , you forget that sometimes a princess becomes a queen . " <p> " Ha , princesses . What worth are you if your father has to tack a dozen counties to your bum to get those French poofters to look at you . " <p> " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fool 's second , for you merely carry the drool cup for the Natural . What 's the ransom for a jester , Pocket ? A bucket of warm spittle . " <p> I grabbed my chest .. " Pierced to the core , I am , " I gasped . I staggered to a chair . " I bleed , I suffer , I die on the forked lance of your words . " <p> She came to me . " You do not . " <p> " No , stay back . Blood stains will never come out of linen - they are stubborned with your cruelty and guilt ... " <p> " Pocket , stop it now . " <p> " You have kilt me , lady , most dead . " I gasped , I spasmed , I coughed . " Let it always be said that this humble fool brought joy to all whom he met . " <p> " No one will say that . " <p> " Shhhh , child . I grow weak . No breath . " I looked at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off a chair , to the floor . " But I want you to know that despite your vicious nature and your freakishly large feet , I have always- " <p> And then I died . Bloody fucking brilliantly , I 'd say , too , hint of a shudder at the end as death 's chilly hand grabbed my knob . <p> " What ? What ? You have always what ? " <p> I said nothing , being dead. , and not a little exhausted from all the bleeding and gasping . Truth be told , under the jest I felt like I 'd taken a bolt to the heart . <p> " You 're absolutely no help at all , " said Cordelia . <p> The raven landed on the wall as I made my way back to the common house in search of Drool . No little vexed was I by the news of Cordelia 's looming nuptials . <p> " Ghost ! " said the raven . <p> " I did n't teach you that . " <p> " Bollocks ! " Replied the Raven . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ghost ! " <p> " Piss off , bird , " said I. <p> Then a cold wind bit at my bum and at the top of the stairs , in the turret ahead , I saw a shimmering in the shadows , like silk in sunlight - not quite in the shape of a woman . <p> And the ghost said : <p> " With grave offense to daughters three , " Alas the King a fool shall be . " <p> " Rhymes ? You 're looming about all diaphanous in the middle of the day , puking cryptic rhymes ? Low craft and tawdry art , ghosting about at noon - a parson 's fart heralds darker doom , thou babbling wisp . " <p> " Ghost ! " Cried the raven , and with that the ghost was gone . <p> There 's always a bloody ghost . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
