Here 's a handy time saver for next week : skip just about all the post-Iowa analysis . If history is any guide , almost all of it will be wrong . For instance , if somebody says " the road to the White House leads through Des Moines , " ask him if he 's using Amelia Earhart 's map . Yes , Jimmy Carter used Iowa in 1976 to show he was a serious contender , but that 's about it . More often than not , Iowa fades into insignificance by the time New Hampshire votes . Wait a minute , you say . Would n't big Iowa victories provide momentum for front runners George W. Bush and Al Gore in New Hampshire ? Let 's look at the record . <P> George Bush shocked Ronald Reagan with a 2-point win in 1980 . That prompted Bush to proclaim he had " the Big Mo , " and prompted an NBC analyst to suggest that " Ronald Reagan is politically dead . " Eight years later , it was future President Bush 's turn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish . That was the year Pat Robertson dominated headlines with a second-place finish . It was also the year Dick Gephardt won the Democratic contest , while Michael Dukakis finished third . It 's possible , of course , that front runners Bush and Gore could both win Iowa and lose New Hampshire , then go on to win their nominations . But if that happens , it will be thanks to South Carolina , Arizona , California or Texas voters  --  not to what happened in Iowa . <P> Do you plan to savor the new polls ? Spend your time more productively by rearranging your sock drawer . Why ? Consider 1984 . On the eve of the New Hampshire primary , the New York Times reported that Walter Mondale " now holds the most commanding lead ever recorded this early in a Presidential nomination campaign by a nonincumbent . " His nearly 3-1 triumph in Iowa had given him a 57-8 lead in national polls over nearest rival Jesse Jackson . And less than 24 hours later , Gary Hart beat him by 10 points in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that poll an anomaly ? Not exactly . Four years earlier , on the eve of the New York primary , the New York Daily News showed Carter with a 55-37 lead over Ted Kennedy . Actual results : Kennedy 59 , Carter 41 . What happened ? Pollster Lou Harris explained that " Kennedy benefited from the light vote . " <P> Were these polls right or wrong ? That 's largely irrelevant . The real point is , they do n't matter . At this stage of a campaign , voters ' minds are subject to change without notice . Even in Iowa and New Hampshire , where candidates take out residency papers , last-minute changes are commonplace . And national polls measure almost nothing worth thinking about . Most people have n't even begun to contemplate the campaign , and their choices are a thin gruel of name recognition and vague impression . <P> Now , since history is not necessarily destiny , this year could be different . Maybe a strong Steve Forbes showing in Iowa persuades him to spend millions on TV ads in New Hampshire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill Bradley supporters in New Hampshire . The likely result , though , is that Iowa will once again prove to be the Brigadoon of American politics , disappearing into the mists , never to be heard from until the next leap year dawns .
