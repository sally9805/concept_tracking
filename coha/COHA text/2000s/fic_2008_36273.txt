" Forty-four is too young for a woman to die . " Isaac Richmond sipped black coffee from a U.S. Army mug , then fixed his ice-blue eyes on the framed photograph in his other hand . He rested the mug on the coffee table . " You do n't agree . " <p> " It 's only right for you to feel that way , Colonel Richmond , " I said . " But no , I do n't think there 's such a thing as ' too young to die . ' ? " I drank some coffee . It was instant , but I like instant . Guilty pleasure . <p> Isaac Richmond had been retired from the army for twenty years , but a cursory examination of his study told me a lot . There were photos of Richmond in full dress uniform receiving medals and commendations , shaking hands with generals . In other photos he wore green camouflage BDUs  --  boarding a transport plane , standing in a mess hall , sitting in a jeep on a downtown Saigon street . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee mugs . Not one thing gave testimony to the two decades of Richmond 's life since he retired his commission . <p> And then there was the man himself . He was harder at seventy-four than I was , still ( if barely ) a year shy of forty . He held himself in perfect posture and even his silver hair stood at attention , trimmed just slightly longer than a standard-issue crew cut . Clearly this was a man who defined himself by his military service , so I addressed him by rank and he did n't correct me . <p> " You have children , Mr. Dudgeon ? " <p> " No , sir . " <p> " Believe me , there is such a thing as ' too young to die . ' If you ever have kids , you 'll understand . " He cleared his throat and handed me the photograph . " My daughter . Joan . " <p> Joan Richmond looked remarkably like her father  --  the same erect posture , the same blue eyes , the same compact features . Sharp chin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the features conspired to make him look like a hard-ass , whereas on Joan the overall impression was that of a shy librarian . Proper , but not a prude . Not beautiful , but pleasant to look at . Friendlier than her father . And fragile . <p> Before coming to Richmond 's house in Dearborn Park , I 'd read over the newspaper coverage of his daughter 's murder , six weeks earlier . Joan Richmond was single , lived alone . She was the head of payroll for HM Nichols , a midsize department store chain . The man who killed her , Steven Zhang , was a naturalized American citizen who 'd come from China thirteen years earlier . He was a freelance IT consultant Joan had hired to update the employee payroll system and optimize the database . After shooting Joan to death , he 'd gone home and killed himself , leaving behind a wife and young daughter . And a written confession that sounded all kinds of crazy . The cops investigated and collected the results of various forensic tests and cleared the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angelo sent Richmond my way ? <p> " Colonel Richmond , I am sorry for your loss but I 'm not sure what I can do for you . Do you think the police got it wrong ? " I set the photograph on the coffee table between us . Isaac Richmond 's mouth tightened , twitched once . <p> " This is a very intimate business between us , Mr. Dudgeon , and I am not accustomed to discussing my personal life with strangers . " His mouth tightened again and , although I had n't noticed any room for improvement , his posture got even straighter . " I 'm sorry , " he said , " that 's not fair . I called you , you did n't call me . " <p> I reached into my briefcase and withdrew a form , signed it , and handed it to him . " Standard nondisclosure agreement . I 'm not in the habit of spreading the details of my clients ' personal lives around the schoolyard , Colonel . " <p> " No , I 'm sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He put the form on the table , next to the photo of his dead daughter . " It just goes against my nature to discuss such things . I spent twenty-six years in military intelligence . Our division motto was Learn All , Say Nothing . I 've been living by that motto since I was a very young man . It made me a somewhat distant husband and father , I 'm sorry to say . My wife  --  Joan 's mother  --  died when Joan was only seven years old . Bad heart . . . genetic . Joan grew up on military bases all over the world , raised really by a succession of army matrons , and I was not there very often . She was like an orphan with a wide assortment of kindly aunts , but we were redeployed regularly and even those relationships never had the time to deepen . " <p> He sat for a minute saying nothing . The look on his face suggested that he was back in time , on army bases in Germany and Korea and who knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was I ? Yes , right . I was absent for much of Joan 's upbringing . She developed into an exceedingly intelligent young woman but very inward , quiet , not as socially confident as she should have been . Eventually she moved stateside , matriculated from Northwestern  --  double major : Economics and Accounting . Summa cum laude . " He drank down the rest of his coffee , which had long since gone cold . " She could 've done so much . But she was a whiz at math and I suppose a career in accounting shielded her from having to deal with people , to some extent . And she was good at it . <p> " My parental failings notwithstanding , Joan welcomed me into her life when I eventually settled in Chicago and we managed to build a friendly relationship . A good relationship . There were boundaries I could not cross  --  she was not going to pretend that we had much history and I was not invited to offer fatherly guidance . And she insisted on calling me Isaac , never Dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily , and we dined together every Saturday . I suggested that we make it a weekday  --  Saturday is prime dating time for young working people  --  but Joan did n't seem interested in dating . I do n't think she was a lesbian , and even if she were , one presumes she would still go out on dates . She just seemed uncomfortable with the idea of romantic relationships of any kind . No doubt a result of her upbringing . Collateral damage of my service , I 'm afraid . " Richmond shook it off with a rueful chuckle . " Listen to me . An old man wallowing in his regrets , while you sit nodding politely and wondering what the hell any of this has to do with you . " <p> <br> Continues ...
