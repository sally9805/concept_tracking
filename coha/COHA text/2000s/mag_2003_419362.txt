<p> " There are no such things as incurable ; there are only things for which man has not found a cure . "  --  Simon Baruch <p> Losing Weight with Tea <p> Can tea keep the calories from sticking to your ribs ? If Dr. Liang-Che Tao has it right , you can cleanse greasy fingers by dipping them into a bowl of tea and the tea will not appear oily . They do it in China . Dr. Tao theorizes that tea in your GI tract will somehow miraculously take away the fat molecules before they can lodge in your tissues . Dr. Tao lost weight by drinking tea , and he is able to keep the weight off . <p> Over 800 readers have requested a copy of Dr. Tao 's tea diet . See " A Brisk Tea Diet " in this issue and visit our Web site at www.satevepost.org to hear from the many Post readers who are investigating Dr. Tao 's tea diet success . Vitamin Therapy for Macular Degeneration <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> I have heard that vitamins might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study findings have been publicized and accepted as valid . Gladys DeKruyter Oak Brook , Illinois <p> <p> A major study shows that taking vitamin and mineral supplements can reduce the risk of vision loss in people with intermediate or advanced age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) in one eye only . <p> " The nutrients are not a cure for AMD , nor will they restore vision already lost from the disease , " said Dr. Paul Sieving , director of the National Eye Institute . " But they will play a key role in helping people at high risk for developing advanced AMD keep their vision . " <p> The Age-Related Eye Disease Study ( AREDS ) was sponsored by the National Institutes of Health and involved 4,757 participants , 55 to 80 years of age , in 11 research centers around the country . Results are published in the October 2001 issue of Archives of Ophthalmology . <p> Daily doses used in the study were : 500 milligrams of vitamin C , 400 international units of vitamin E , 15 milligrams of beta carotene , 80 milligrams of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxide . Copper should be taken with zinc , because high-dose zinc is linked to copper deficiency . <p> Study data indicate that the same nutrients have no effect on the development of cataracts . Magnetic Inserts Helped His Foot Pain <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> I never heard of peripheral neuropathy until I was hit with it last year . Since then I have read about it in the Post on occasion , searched the Internet for info , and had every test you could imagine to try and find out the cause . None was found . If it is n't due to diabetes , the doctors do n't seem to have a clue . The answer I usually get after all the tests is that " you are getting old . " Well , I know that ! I am 62 years old and this earthly body is wearing out . But I think that there must be some other answer . <p> Before PN , I could run up to 15 miles at a time , but would not run over 22 miles in one week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of days after running just two or three miles . Then I was encouraged to try magnetic inserts . I put them in my socks and wear them to bed at night . I also put them in my slippers when I was watching TV or reading . <p> It took a little while , but my feet started feeling much better . The ankle weakness has improved along with the numbness and sharp pain . I have been walking six miles just about every day and started running again . I am now up to two miles and rising with no ill effects . I urge anyone with PN to try the magnetic inserts ( purchase the best ones ) for some relief . Leon Wilczynski Covington , Louisiana <p> Swallowing Problem After Bypass Surgery <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> First , I want to thank you for your " Medical Mailbox . " We readers are truly blessed to get medical insight not only from you but also from your readers . <p> Perhaps you or your readers can help my husband . It has been five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and since that time he has not been able to eat or drink without aspiration . The only explanation we ever get is that his swallowing muscles are very weak  --  diagnosed as " dysphasia with aspiration . " He is tube-fed and has a capped tracheostomy . <p> He has had a good bit of speech therapy but still is unable to pass the so-called " cookie swallowing test . " My husband had no problem eating or drinking prior to his operation . Any help we can get will be appreciated . Mrs. John E. Grevish Greensburg , Pennsylvania <p> <p> Have any of our readers or their loved ones experienced swallowing problems after open-heart bypass surgery ? We hope our readers will let us know of any such cases . We will share with you any suggestions we receive . <p> Coincidental medical illnesses  --  including stroke and Parkinson 's disease  --  account for many cases of swallowing disorders . <p> The ability to swallow requires the precise coordination of over 100 muscles in the head and neck by nerves in the brain . As a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat . Speech therapy to strengthen muscles in the mouth and throat is often recommended . <p> Postsurgical patients often continue to recover for about one year . We believe you have cause to be guardedly optimistic . Folate and Other B Vitamins Help Heart Patients <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> I read that a six-month regimen of folic acid , vitamin B 12 , and vitamin B 6 can help prevent recurrence of blocked arteries in patients who have undergone coronary angioplasty . Can you tell me how much one should take ? <p> Our son had a heart attack in June 2001 . Although bypass surgery was recommended , he opted to try diet , exercise , and medications , and is doing fine . Might the vitamin B therapy be helpful for him ? Jo Callison Eldorado , Texas <p> <p> You are referring to a recent study conducted by Dr. Guido Schnyder , an assistant professor in the cardiology division at the University of California at San Diego . Heart patients in the clinical trial were treated with daily doses of folic acid ( one milligram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vitamin B 6 ( 10 milligrams ) for six months . One year later , data show that those on the vitamin regimen were nearly 40 percent less likely to have needed repeat angioplasties or heart bypass operations than those taking dummy pills . <p> An earlier study by Dr. Schnyder and his colleagues showed a 48 percent reduction in the development of restenosis after six months of vitamin therapy . <p> " It was important to follow these patients for another six months because that 's the time frame in which restenosis typically occurs , " he explained . " We 've now shown that the vitamin combination did not just delay the development of restenosis ; it prevented it . " <p> Researchers believe the treatment works by lowering excess levels of the amino acid homocysteine , implicated in cardiovascular disease . <p> Dr. Schnyder advises that the safe and inexpensive vitamin therapy be considered as adjunctive therapy for patients undergoing coronary angioplasty . Some cardiologists believe it might help promote healthy blood vessels in heart patients such as your son and those with high blood pressure as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had blockage in the carotid arteries leading to the brain . He avoided an endarterectomy by improving his dietary and exercise habits and taking generous morning and evening doses of vitamin C , Slow-Mag , folic acid , B 6 , and B 2 . Thirty years later , his blockage was reduced from nearly 90 percent to less than 50 percent . He is no longer a candidate for surgical removal of plaque from his carotid arteries and continues to be a leader in his community . Coping With Breast Cancer <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> I was recently diagnosed with breast cancer and am undergoing treatment and surgeries . I would greatly appreciate any information you can provide . I am new to all this and , at age 32 , was not at all expecting to have to deal with cancer . <p> I have made my career my top priority since high school . Now I can truly say that all the long hours just do n't matter . To all the workaholics out there , please remember to live a healthy , balanced life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer me . Tiffany Indianapolis , Indiana <p> <p> I 'm happy to respond to your e-mail and offer my humble advice . I would begin reading and studying everything available about past experiments and current research on breast cancer . <p> Keep optimistic . I have a dear friend and neighbor who had breast cancer and surgery nearly 40 years ago . A few years ago , she won the backstroke competition in the Master Swimmers ' Program in Ft . Lauderdale in the 80-and-over age group . <p> My secretary of 25 years is also a breast cancer survivor . When I went to the hospital for her surgery , we were relieved to learn that her tumor did not contain the most aggressive type of breast cancer cells . The most difficult part of her recovery was due to pain from muscles taken from her back for breast reconstruction . My advice to you , should you ever opt for a mastectomy , would be to purchase the best , prettiest padded bras you can find and forego the pain of breast reconstruction with borrowed muscle tissue from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is handled , I would advise you to go back to school . Consider studying breast cancer genetics and join the effort to discover a cure and ways to prevent this pervasive disease that affects so many women and their families . If I were 32 years old , I would put less important activities on hold and cocoon with medical books and become very involved in breast cancer research at a major university medical center . <p> You might ask our archivist Steve Pettinga to send you a copy of the Jan. /Feb. 2002 Post article " Surviving Breast Cancer . " What Sexual Partners Should Know <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> My friend says she is safe because her boyfriend uses a condom . Does a condom prevent viruses that cause hepatitis and AIDS ? <p> You ask a good question . The human papilloma virus is infectious through the skin . It can be contracted from contact with skin in infected areas the condom does n't cover . This virus is known to cause cervical cancer many years after the original infection . Hepatitis might also occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We do n't know if the HIV virus can be spread through skin contact . It is believed to be most often spread through bodily fluids . <p> Condoms do not protect from all sexually transmitted diseases . Beat the Winter Blues <p> A new three-step plan might help people combat symptoms of mild depression such as eating too much , low energy , tension , and difficulties with sleep and concentration . <p> Dr. Marie-Annette Brown recently completed a study at the University of Washington to explore the effects of light , exercise , and vitamin therapy on women 's moods . Findings from the eight-week clinical trial show that most participants experienced relief from their symptoms by getting more bright-light exposure during the day ; going for a brisk outdoor walk 20 minutes a day , five days a week ; and taking a specific combination of vitamins and nutrients , including B vitamins , selenium , and vitamin D. In addition , 25 percent of the women in the study lost weight , even though they had not been asked to diet . <p> " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The more you build your life around light and exercise , the more energetic , healthy , and trim you will be . " <p> The study was conducted from October into December , a time of increasing rainfall and declining hours of daylight in the Pacific Northwest . The researchers found that even the cloudiest day delivered more light to the eyes than the brightest indoor lighting . <p> More information about Dr. Brown 's Levity Program is available at www.satevepost.org or by writing to our editorial offices . Medicare Coverage for Alzheimer 's Disease <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> A cousin read in the Sept. /Oct. 2002 " Medical Mailbox " about Alzheimer 's treatment being covered by Medicare . How can we get more information on this ? His wife is receiving the medication , and it is very costly . Marcia Nelson via e-mail <p> <p> On September 1 , 2001 , Medicare contractors were informed they can no longer automatically deny claims based solely on the Alzheimer 's diagnosis . Previously , most Medicare computers were programmed to reject all claims related to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medicare would provide payment for specific speech , occupational and rehabilitation therapies , " said Tom Scully , an administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services .

Reader Remedies for Blepharitis <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> First , let me confess that I had always thought you were a man until I read your delightful article about having dinner with President Reagan in the Sept. /Oct . Post ! <p> I am writing about Robyn Hope 's problem with blepharitis . An allergic reaction to glaucoma drops caused me to develop a severe case of blepharitis . The treatment prescribed by my doctor was similar to that described by Dr. Valluri . The doctor changed my medicine and , after several months of the treatment regimen , the blepharitis disappeared . Sara Manis Jamestown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is my home remedy for crusty eyes . When I was 14 years old , I read in a magazine that applying castor oil to one 's eyelashes daily would promote growth of the lashes . Thinking it would be nice to have long lashes , I started the practice . Needless to say , it did n't make my eyelashes grow any longer . But to my amazement , it took away the scales and the itching of my eyes . <p> I put the oil on at night after showering , just prior to bedtime . If my eyes are a bit dry during the day , I put on a smaller amount , as it burns a bit . Hope this helps someone with this problem . Barbara McDonald Fostoria , Ohio <p> <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> I have had blepharitis for several years . Whenever I go to the doctor for an eye exam , I get a prescription for Tobradex . I use one drop in the morning and one drop in the evening for seven to eight days . It stops the symptoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sapphire , North Carolina <p> <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> The treatment my doctor prescribed for blepharitis closely follows the one in your column . He recommends using tear-less baby shampoo that is now on the market . Claire Webster Larned , Kansas <p> <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> I suffer with blepharitis . My ophthalmologist was treating me with eye scrubs and drops . One day I asked my family doctor if handling a cat could cause this problem . He said yes . <p> I stopped holding my neighbor 's cat and within a month my eyes started to improve . I no longer have this problem . I had been seeing my eye specialist every three months for two years . Joan Curtis Aulisio Dalton , Pennsylvania <p> <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> I had blepharitis and tried medications , eye washes , and eye drops without success . <p> Then I read in the newspaper about flaxseed oil for the condition . It worked for me . I take 1,000 milligrams of organic flaxseed oil each morning and evening . Edith Hurlbut Eastsound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women with blepharitis than from men who suffer from the condition . We asked Indianapolis ophthalmologist Dr. Thierry Wilbrandt about his experience with treating the chronic condition . <p> " In my practice , I treat many more women than men for this problem , " he said . " It is believed that hormonal changes in women may make them subject to the eye condition . The problem comes with age . Women may begin getting ' dry eyes ' in their 40s and frequently require use of artificial tears in their 70s . " <p> Dr. Wilbrandt explained that blepharitis tends to recur . He was very optimistic , however , that the symptoms can be cured . <p> Readers may send their letters to 1100 Waterway Blvd. , Indianapolis , IN 46202 or via e-mail : **29;987;TOOLONG .
