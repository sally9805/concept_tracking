Section : Reports : Social Movements The social movement renaissance in the Americas <p> The 2003 Latin American Studies Association conference featured numerous sessions directly and indirectly related to the reemergence of social movements in our hemisphere . The academic interest in this topic is paralleled by the growing recognition on the part of governments and international institutions that social movements are a force with which to be reckoned . Social actors can no longer be dismissed as anti-growth or anti-globalization fringe elements . Their role as generators of ideas , framers of public opinion and articulators of a range of policy options is real and attracting attention . <p> Social movements are influencing political processes in tangible ways , as well as altering the manner in which impoverished and marginalized citizens throughout the Americas view themselves in relation to political systems and processes that have largely failed to promote the public interest or reverse growing inequality and poverty . <p> Today 's social movements are reemerging at a time when we are witnessing the results of the seismic shifts in relations between markets , politics and society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Latin America in the 1980s and 1990s . Much has been written about the spread of democracy throughout the hemisphere , and yet governments in the Americas are increasingly accountable to the austerity requirements of international institutions , such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund . This policy environment has narrowed the ideological " wiggle room " between political parties once sharply differentiated by their approaches to macro- and microeconomic policy and the role of the state . The capacity of any political party to respond to growing popular demands for access to education , health care , environmental justice and other elements of the withering social safety net has decreased dramatically . <p> In turn , political parties find their ability to negotiate for the demands of their constituents severely truncated , fostering widespread disillusionment among their constituencies . According to Philip Oxhorn , in 1996 an average of only 14% of Latin Americans considered the policies being pursued by their politicians as viable and acceptable solutions to their personal dilemmas . This disenchantment has created a gap between politics and people . New social and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and solutions to that gap . Social Movement Mechanics <p> Social movements are groups of individuals , associations and organizations , including community-based groups , policy-oriented think tanks or nongovernmental organizations ( NGOs ) , which coordinate formally and informally with each other to enact some form of political or social change . Individually , their structure includes elements normally associated with " civil society " groups . Linkages between organizations in this framework tend to be more political and quite fluid in nature , with diverse participants contributing at varying levels at different times in the movement 's lifecycle . Movements are increasingly " cross-border " in nature , as well , although it is almost impossible to determine the precise moment when in its development cycle a movement shifts from a group of concerned individuals , associations and organizations to a full-blown social movement involving substantial portions of the citizenry . <p> Analysts continue to debate the relative long-term implications of structural fluidity and the capacities that flow from it . For now , this fluidity is paying significant dividends by creating a framework that is structured enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability to heighten public consciousness about issues that might not otherwise have been near the center of political discourse . <p> Consider the World Social Forum ( WSF ) phenomenon . The WSF began in Porto Alegre , Brazil in 2001 as a gathering of about 10,000 individuals seeking an alternative to the narrowly focused priorities of the World Economic Forum ( WEF ) held annually in Davos , Switzerland . By 2003 , the WSF had grown to 100,000 international participants and was headlined by leading progressive activists and opinion makers , including newly elected Brazilian President Luiz Incio " Lula " da Silva , whose victory was in no small part due to his political solidarity with Brazil 's diverse social movements . <p> The WSF describes itself as " an open meeting place where groups and movements of civil society opposed to neo-liberalism and a world dominated by capital or by any form of imperialism , but engaged in building a planetary society centered on the human person , come together to pursue their thinking , to debate ideas democratically , formulate proposals , share their experiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , national and regional forums on every continent are replicating the WSF model . Talks have begun for a North American Social Forum in 2005 . The Multiplier Effect <p> The growth of social movements has a powerful multiplier effect in all areas of civic , economic and political life . This effect is particularly acute in Latin America , where many countries have a history of suppression of public dissent , sometimes through officially sanctioned violence or other extreme measures . <p> Social movement organizations in Latin America and throughout the world are working to reconstitute the very meaning of citizenship and to hold democracy accountable to its highest ideals . Social movements are more likely than other elements of civil society to put issues of gender , race , class and culture at the center of the political discourse , thereby adding to the political vocabulary . Sonia E. Alvarez has labeled this type of engagement " cultural politics , " a strategy designed to redefine the very meaning of what can be considered " political . " <p> This kind of politicization has the potential to expand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent , private institutions to act on equity and justice concerns . The nature of this particular kind of activism is designed to create significant shifts in public interest , attitude and debate . <p> Argentine analysts Catalina Smulovitz and Enrique Peruzzotti have documented a process they term " societal accountability . " They argue that by spotlighting and successfully framing their messages around an issue , social movements provide political space in an otherwise apathetic climate for branches of the government - such as the judiciary - to investigate and hold accountable actors in other parts of the bureaucracy . Smulovitz and Peruzzotti cite the processes that led to the 1992 impeachment of Brazilian President Fernando Collor de Mello on corruption charges and the recent development and implementation of election monitoring mechanisms in Mexico as examples of societal accountability at work . Social movements have become integral actors in the efforts to consolidate nascent and vulnerable Latin American democracies that continue to exhibit elements of the social and economic policies of their authoritarian predecessors . <p> Increasingly , social movements consider tracking and critiquing the emergence of neoliberal economic policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role in consolidating democracy . The Free Trade Area of the Americas ( FTAA ) , in particular , has become a magnet for social movements with diverse interests . FTAA <p> If completed , the FTAA - scheduled to take effect in January 2005 - will encompass 34 nations and more than 800 million people . Throughout the hemisphere , networks of social movements composed of small and mid-level farmers , indigenous peoples , environmentalists , community-based groups , academics , labor unions , think tanks and policy-oriented organizations are constructing a comprehensive critique of the agreement , whose current form , they predict , will bring negative social and environmental impacts . Beverly Bell of the Center for Economic Justice surveyed nine of the hemisphere 's most influential grass-roots social movements and found that the model of economic integration that the FTAA represents is the central target for their advocacy and mobilization activities . <p> While some government officials would dismiss these groups as " protectionists " who arc against free trade , this description is too often nothing more than a generalization . In studying the social movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Miami political scientist William C. Smith has found an insider-outsider dynamic at work in social movements . Smith identifies two types of elements involved : one located on the fringes of the political process , waging a campaign of opposition and protest , and another situated not directly at the negotiating table but close enough to exert some degree of influence on the process . In other words , social movements are rarely homogeneous forces that share a common objective , but instead display great degrees of political heterogeneity . <p> To date , policy makers have been slow to entertain seriously the demands of social movements and other civil society actors regarding the social , environmental , economic justice and equity issues involved in the FTAA . In 1998 , in response to growing social movement action , the negotiators established the Committee of Government Representatives on the Participation of Civil Society ( CGR ) . The " committee , " however , is little more than an on-line mailbox on the official FTAA website inviting civil society actors to submit their suggestions and analyses to the trade ministers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizations and held concurrent to the trade negotiations at the VIII Trade Ministerial in Miami in November 2003 also proved contentious . Initially , many civil society organizations rejected participation in the forum based on their repeated claims that it was developed in a manner neither transparent nor accessible to the diverse range of civil society groups throughout the hemisphere . What actual impact the proceedings of the alternative forum and any future similar forums will have on the FTAA negotiations remains as yet unclear . <p> The continued closed-door nature of the FTAA negotiations , combined with the absence of a formal effective structure for citizen engagement at the domestic and hemispheric levels , has led in turn to only greater calls for transparency and accountability . Social movement groups have devoted significant resources and time to politicizing and localizing trade issues in an effort to leverage the power of their members as voters and consumers . Ironically , in the United States , these messages are resonating with a growing chorus of business and political interests whose current concerns include the loss of US manufacturing jobs , the growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worrisome trends . <p> This in no way means that business and social movement interests have merged . Rather , the convergence signifies the diversity of calls for a fundamental reassessment of international trade policy . <p> Social movements have succeeded in spreading awareness and criticism of the FTAA . Many take as evidence of their impact the inability of trade ministers to come to a consensus around the original " single undertaking " FTAA vision in Miami ; instead , the ministers opted to mask their differences by agreeing to an " la carte " version : a thin skeleton of an agreement with only a promise to resume negotiation of divisive issues such as agricultural subsidies and the so-called Singapore issues at a later date . <p> Can social movements and those who represent their political gains , such as Brazil 's Lula , shift the trajectory of the FTAA and other economic integration debates by raising issues of market access for developing nations and the need to prioritize the elimination of poverty and inequality ? The FTAA debate is taking place within the context of a broad-scale critique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This discussion of the nature , vision and timing of economic integration is one of the healthiest and most timely debates in which citizens can engage . Policy makers would do well to take the demands of such groups seriously . <p> Social actors can no longer be dismissed as anti-growth or anti-globalization fringe elements . Their role as generators of ideas , framers of public opinion and articulators of a range of policy is attract-attention . <p> By Tanya Dawkins and Eduardo Moncada <p>
