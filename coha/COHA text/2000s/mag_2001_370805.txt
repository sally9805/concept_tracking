The author of the best-titled book of the ' 90s ( We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed with Our Families : Stories from Rwanda ) has taken on another grim reconstruction : a 27-year-old murder . No car-chase thrills here , merely the gathering of string , knotted together to lasso the perpetrator , who is the guy everyone thought it was all along . Gourevitch is more interested in context , argot and character than plot . The book is the better for it . <P>  --  By Belinda Luscombe
