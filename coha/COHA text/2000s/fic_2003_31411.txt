One of the downside risks of producing your own suicide is that you probably wo n't get the opportunity to reshoot . It 's pretty much a one-take business . Barring , of course , a complete disaster , in which case you wo n't be in any frame of mind to consider the results with any objectivity . You may not , in fact , be in any frame of mind at all . You may be reduced to hanging in there out of pure reflex , your organism metabolizing in spite of your express wishes to the contrary . This ugly thought occurred to Charlie Berns as he fed a rubber hose through a specially drilled hole in the doggie door that led out to the patio of his 5,400-square-foot house in the Beverly Hills Flats . If push came to shove , he would rather go through with the indignities of his present situation than wind up in vegetableville . Charlie shuddered at the prospect and resolved to be very careful . The 560 SEL was parked as close to the house as he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his vindictive gardener had denuded months ago . Jos Garca y Garca and his brother-in-law Pepe had backed up a truck in broad daylight and gone around the yard uprooting and reclaiming unpaid-for plants . As a parting gesture his gardener had chain-sawed a lemon tree with such precision that it fell squarely into the pool , where it still lay , its dying limbs drooping in the air . Mr. Kim , the pool man , had at first merely cleaned around the tree , fishing out the soggy , overripe lemons and stacking them like cannonballs on the edge of the patio . Then when Charlie failed to remit in the little envelope stuffed under the door every month , he too stopped coming . His parting gesture had been a paroxysm of expletives in Korean , accompanied by spitting and stamping his feet on the deck . That morning Charlie had gone to Thrifty on Canon and bought seventy-five feet of hose , some putty to fill in the air pockets around the hole in the doggie door , masking tape to seal off any windows that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Gallo Hearty Burgundy . In the house a CD of Eine Kleine Nachtmusik blared from the player . It had been a choice between Mozart and Mitch Miller , with Mozart winning out in the end because of the class factor . Charlie wanted to go out in a classy manner . At this stage of the game , gestures were important . After leaving Thrifty , he had dropped two envelopes in the mailbox , one to Daily Variety and the other to The Hollywood Reporter , containing up-to-date rsums of his credits . Often , in the deadline pressure , they mixed up credits or omitted the most significant ones from the obit . And there was n't much you could do about asking for a correction . As he ran the hose along the Spanish-tile patio , he heard the whine of the vacuum machine sucking up leaves down the street in counterpoint to the low-key hum of pool motors . Sounds of a Beverly Hills morning . Empty houses being tended . For months , since Charlie had been evicted from his office at the Burbank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day long , and he was familiar with the quiet and the sounds that punctuated it : the pizzicato of lawn mowers , the drone of air conditioners , the whomp of tennis balls , the whoosh of German-made disk brakes , the demented chirping of overfed birds . He looked down at his Rolex and saw that it was almost eleven . It was Sunday . No mail . No last-minute reprieve from the governor . His mailbox was filled daily with a collection of letters from lawyers all over Southern California containing threats of varying degrees of explicitness . Before he stopped returning Charlie 's calls , his own lawyer , George Melvin , had recommended Chapter 11 , after , of course , Charlie took care of his legal fees . " You ca n't expect me to handle bankruptcy papers for you on a contingency basis , Charlie , can you ? " They were in George Melvin 's Century City office with a view clear to Mulholland and back . The lawyer was sitting beside his beveled-glass conference table cracking pistachio nuts . Nobody in town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angeles magazine ran a feature on the new type of interactive executive . " Who else is going to do it ? " " I ca n't do contingency work . It 's against the bylaws of the firm . " " George , is n't everything in this town on contingency , one way or another ? " Well , whether George Melvin liked it or not , as executor of his will , he would soon be presiding over the distribution of Charlie 's assets , such as they were . It would be a feeding frenzy with meager pickings . Charlie carefully slit the end of the hose with an X-Acto knife and fit it over the exhaust pipe of the Mercedes . Then he took a large piece of heavy-duty electric tape and bound it around the tail pipe tightly to prevent leaking . When he was finished , he tugged gently on the hose and was pleased when it did n't slip off . He had considered various ways of pulling the plug . Completely hopeless with firearms , he immediately eliminated blowing his brains out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and did n't see why he should start now . He ruled out pills as well . You never knew exactly what the right dosage was , or whether you 'd throw up first and just get very sick . In any case he would have been reduced to an over-the-counter product . His Valium prescription had been shut off months ago . His doctor was n't returning his calls either . And hanging was just too technically complex , requiring a strong-enough rope , a strong-enough place to hang the rope , the proper noose . If you did n't do it right , it could be a terrible mess . Asphyxiation by Mercedes exhaust seemed the best way of going about it . Nothing jarring , nothing overly technical or unpleasant . He would just drift across the border without any formalities , transported by the efficiency of German engineering . Auf wiedersehen ... Have a nice day .... It was while imagining the purring pistons of the engine of the 560 SEL that he suddenly realized the gas tank was low . Typical of all the decisions he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car , figuring there was no point in checking out with a full tank . He had no idea how much exhaust it took to do the job . This was one time he did n't want to be caught short . He tried to remember where he had left the keys after coming back from Thrifty that morning . He put away the X-Acto knife and walked back through the bleeding flower beds to the patio , looking around on the rusting deck furniture for his keys , which were nowhere to be found . He retraced his steps , starting from the back door to the kitchen where he had entered earlier . While in the kitchen he absently opened the refrigerator and found nothing but a bottle of flat Perrier . On the counter , however , was the rapidly defrosting cherry cheesecake . He sliced off a small piece to tide him over , eating it right off the knife . He decided to put what was left in the freezer . Opening the freezer door , he discovered a microwave pizza that he thought he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point leaving any assets unamortized . He took it out , popped it into the microwave , then resumed looking for his car keys . They turned out to be in his jacket pocket , draped over the banister in the hallway , where he had left them when he had gone upstairs to tape the windows shut . Charlie went back out the patio door to the Mercedes , turned the key in the ignition and watched the gas needle barely budge off the empty mark . Back inside the house , he grabbed his $1,900 French leather jacket and then could n't remember where he had left his wallet . The microwave beeped . He opened the door , looked at the bubbling cheese strands running off the edge , and decided to pass . It required all his concentration to remember that his wallet was in the back pocket of a pair of dirty jeans lying in a heap upstairs in the bathroom . His cleaning lady had volunteered to go on the cuff when he explained to her about his cash-flow problem , but Charlie had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the mire of genteel poverty . Since he rarely went out , he did n't need much in the way of clean clothes . Frozen pizzas were basically maintenance-free . So he wound up living off the fat of the land , a Bedouin in his own house . Actually he had been doing quite well in this scaled-down existence until they disconnected the TV cable . The sons of bitches came right in the middle of Donahue and pulled the plug . Charlie lay there on the couch and watched three transvestites and their mothers dissolve into snow . Sometimes , late at night , he could get a decent signal off the rusted 1950s roof antenna . That was the point at which he started sleeping during the day . There was no one to disturb Charlie during the day because his phone was cut right after they clipped the cable . Not that anybody would have called him . Certainly not Brad Emprin . When his agent of twenty years , Jerry Belcher , bought the ranch after a triple bypass , the agency had tossed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk of a twenty-eight-year-old ex-network development director . They had their first and last lunch at a trendy pasta place on Melrose . They sat uncomfortably on minimalist Italian furniture , amid a cacophony of conversation from tables too close to one another , as his new agent put away a skimpy pasta primavera without cheese . Brad Emprin was concerned about cholesterol . He ate a low-fat , high-fiber breakfast every morning , then ran three-point-five miles , showered and got into the office by eight so that he could read scripts before the phones started ringing . " You know how many scripts I take home on an average weekend ? " Charlie shook his head . " Twelve , maybe fifteen . They 're piled up next to my bed . Sometimes on a Friday night , I just grab something to eat and get right into bed , knock off a half a dozen before falling out . " " That 's great , Brad . " " You got to keep up with the material . That 's the name of the game  --  material . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Brad attacked lunch . Finally , Charlie looked at him and asked the inevitable question , " So what 's going on ? " Brad took a sip of his San Pellegrino water and cleared his throat . He flexed his jaw muscles trying to dislodge a pasta strand from his teeth . " Things are a little slow at the moment , Charlie , but I 've got feelers out all over town . In fact just yesterday I was talking about you to someone . " " Who 's that ? " " Deidre Hearn . " " Who ? " " She 's a very bright lady . Started out as a reader for Mike Corvene a couple of years ago . Now she 's at a major studio . " " She 's a reader ? " Brad drained the Pellegrino , looked off for a moment at an anorexic woman talking like a machine gun at the next table . " She 's this close to Norman . " He indicated by placing his thumb and forefinger a fraction of an inch apart . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point of talking to someone about me doing a picture if that person ca n't say yes ? " " I think she 's having sex with Norman . Maybe not . Someone told me he thought she was having sex with Norman .... Look , Charlie , the point is that this lady is going to be running a studio someday . She 's hot . I know it . And she 's aware of you . " " Aware of me ? " " Name of the game . Client awareness . We talk about it in the staff meeting all the time . " " Great . " " She 's a pistol . I 'm telling you .... " Charlie closed his eyes for a moment , rubbed them gingerly . Often this was an effective means of dissipating anger . When he opened them , however , Brad Emprin was still sitting across from him talking about client awareness . Charlie put his finger to his lips to indicate that his agent should be quiet . " Brad , I want you to watch my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't need any more people aware of me . There are a number of lawyers and collection agencies around town that are already aware of me . " " I understand what you 're saying , Charlie . " " Do you ? " " Absolutely ... " Brad Emprin sat across from him nodding for a long time , then excused himself to use the phone . When he got back , the check had arrived . " I 'm afraid we 're going to have to split this , Charlie , " he said , shaking his head sadly . " It 's the new agency policy . No more client lunches . " He stared at the check for a minute , then : " Thirty bucks 'll cover you . You got a parking ticket you need validated ? " The phone calls that followed were punctuated by long beats of silence interspersed with Brad 's list of people who were aware of Charlie Berns . Then Brad was in meetings when he called and took a day or so to get back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlie hung up on him . And when the phone company yanked the line , he was n't bothered anymore by Brad Emprin . As he drove south on Beverly Drive Charlie wondered what the reaction to his suicide would be at the Monday-morning staff meeting where they sat around and discussed client awareness . Whatever else Brad Emprin and his colleagues would say , they would n't be able to say that people were n't aware of him that particular morning . They all would have read the trades on their Exercycles before the staff meeting and they would be aware that Charlie Berns , fifty-two , producer of such films as et cetera , sucked a Mercedes tail pipe that morning in his Beverly Hills home . He pulled into the gas station on Little Santa Monica and went directly to the full-service pump . The short Iranian with the klos T-shirt handed him the clipboard . Charlie signed on a Union 76 credit card that had been cut off two months ago . It gave him some satisfaction to stiff the Iranians . They were taking over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he was concerned . He was out of here . Let the Iranians line up behind the rest of them . Charlie left the gas station and headed back across Beverly Hills . He drove up Canyon Drive for the last time , dry-eyed , without regrets . Turning the corner at Elevado , he passed a minivan full of tourists with their maps to the stars ' homes . There were no stars anymore on Charlie 's block ; the houses were all owned by Arabs , Iranians , Koreans and people like Charlie , who had bought in the sixties and could n't afford to pay their gardeners anymore . Charlie pulled to the end of the driveway , then put it in reverse and backed carefully over the vacant flower beds , getting as close to the patio as possible and out of view from the street . Leaving the engine on , he got out , crouched over the tail pipe and started to reattach the hose . The door chimes rang . Charlie ignored them . When they persisted , he got up , went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player . Back outside , he returned to the task of reattaching the hose with a leakproof fit . Humming along with Eine Kleine Nachtmusik , working intensely , Charlie did not notice the figure approaching him from the end of the driveway . " Hello ? " the figure called . Charlie did n't hear . Mozart was at a crescendo . The figure was practically on top of him before Charlie turned around and looked up at a tall skinny kid standing over him with a knapsack . " I think your bell 's out of order . " Charlie stared at this young man , drawing a blank . " I tried calling you lots of times , but your phone 's out of order . The phone company said it 's been disconnected .... When I decided to come out here , you were the first person I called . When I could n't get you on the phone I decided to come out anyway . Nobody knows where you are . My mother 's kind of worried .... What are you doing anyway ? You left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard over the Nachtmusik . Charlie scratched his head . Recognition flooded through a moment before the kid said , " You okay , Uncle Charlie ? " His sister Janice 's youngest kid Lionel . Several years ago at a funeral in New Jersey Lionel had gotten him in a corner and bent his ear about wanting to write for the movies . Charlie had mumbled some vague encouragement , promised to help him when he was ready to come out to Hollywood and try to break into the business . Charlie had n't expected him to show up . Certainly not on the day of his suicide . " I would have called if your phone was n't on the blink . But you said that whenever I got out here , I should get in touch . So here I am . " " How long are you out here for ? " " For as long as it takes . " " It takes to do what ? " " Make it . I got a script with me . I want you to read it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life of Disraeli . " Suicide requires a fair amount of concentration . You do n't want to get interrupted when you 're in the middle . It opens the floodgates to all sorts of equivocations and doubts . Lionel 's arrival on Charlie 's patio at that moment did precisely that . It threw Charlie off . He had been cruising along , dealing with the preparations in an orderly fashion . Now , instead , he found himself in his kitchen splitting the microwave pizza with his nephew . They were sitting across from each other at the bar as Lionel described his odyssey across the country in a Trailways bus , gathering material , as he put it . It was all grist for the mill , life real and raw out there west of New Jersey . " My next script 's going to be about Nebraska . The story of a modern-day cowboy , except this guy 's a crop duster , but you intercut his story , see , with his alter ego a hundred years ago . Kind of a parallel structure ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burgundy . " What are you working on now , Uncle Charlie ? " " I 'm sort of between pictures . " " I saw Jailbreak the other night on TV . They cut the hell out of it . " " Yeah , they do that . " " Ca n't show tits on TV , huh ? " Charlie shook his head solemnly . " They show almost everything else . They got people with their tongues down each other 's throats on the soaps in the afternoon . That 's why I wanted to do this picture on Disraeli . There were standards back then . People just did n't whip their clothes off . They did n't even sleep in the same bedroom .... " " Lionel , " Charlie interrupted , " how 'd you get here ? " " I took the bus , I told you . A hundred and twenty-nine dollars . From Newark . " " No . I mean to my house . You do n't have a car . The bus station 's downtown . " " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment of hesitation before asking , " Where are you staying ? " His nephew smiled a half-baked little grin , shrugged and said , " I was kind of hoping ... here . " " Here ? " " You said that I could stay with you when I came out here . " " I did ? " " Uh-huh . I 'm kind of short on money . " A silence of some duration followed . Lionel dove into the cherry cheesecake and Charlie poured himself another glass of Hearty Burgundy . Finally : " How short of money are you ? " " I got a couple of hundred . " " Two hundred dollars ? " " A hundred eighty actually . " " That 's not going to go too far in this town . " " I figure I 'll sell my script . " " I do n't know how hot Disraeli is right now . " " Would you read it ? I really want to know what you think about it . " And he was off the bar stool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound manuscript , handed it to Charlie . The title page read Bill and Ben . Charlie stared at it for several seconds . " William Gladstone and Benjamin Disraeli , " Lionel explained . " They were kind of like Jules and Jim . I was thinking about Tom Cruise as Disraeli . " At three o'clock in the morning Charlie , not yet dead , lay awake in his upstairs bedroom , his mind spinning at high rpm . He was n't thinking , as might be expected , about the fortuitous arrival of his nephew shortly before he was planning to pollute his brain with carbon monoxide . Nor was he thinking about Benjamin Disraeli , though Lionel had stood over him until he had read all two hundred pages of his screenplay . He was thinking about Bobby Mason . One of the qualities that had helped Charlie Berns survive in Hollywood as long he did was a nearly photographic memory for details . Every morning he read the trade papers , culling a collection of seemingly trivial facts about the shifting tides around him . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the daily reading of the Koran . It gave him solace to know that the show went inexorably on in spite of earthquakes , assassinations and wars . Somewhere in town at every moment a deal was being cut . He slept better knowing that . But he was n't sleeping at the moment . He was remembering a filler item in the gossip column of The Reporter that mentioned that Bobby Mason , the biggest black box-office attraction in the world , was considering a conversion to Judaism following an emotional location scout of the Holy Land for his current picture . Bobby 's manager had said that his client was interested in scripts with a Jewish theme . One of the early scenes in Lionel 's script depicted the baptism of the young Benjamin Disraeli into the bosom of Christ , renouncing his Judaism . It was an easy lift , as far as Charlie was concerned . Downstairs in the guest room his nephew Lionel was presumably asleep . Charlie would have to explain some things to him in the morning . A few hours ago Charlie Berns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or , more accurately , his tail pipe . But that was before Lionel showed up with a script . A producer was someone who had a property . And Charlie now had a property . Or would in the morning when he optioned the rights to Bill and Ben . It was overly warm in his bedroom . And then he remembered why . He got out of bed , stripped off the perspiration-drenched pajama shirt and started carefully to peel the masking tape off his sealed windows .
