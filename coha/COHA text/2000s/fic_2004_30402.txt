Chapter One hush HUSH , MOTHER SAYS . Madeleine is sleeping . She is so beautiful when she sleeps , I do not want to wake her . The small sisters and brothers creep about the bed , their gestures of silence becoming magnified and languorous , fingers floating to pursed lips , tip toes rising and descending as if weightless . Circling about her bed , their frantic activity slows ; they are like tiny insects suspended in sap , kicking dreamily before they crystallize into amber . Together they inhale softly and the room fills with one endless exhalation of breath : Shhhhhhhhhhhhh. madeleine dreams A GROTESQUELY FAT WOMAN lives in the farthest corner of the village . Her name is Matilde . When she walks to market , she must gather up her fat just as another woman gathers up her skirts , daintily pinching it between her fingers and hooking it over her wrists . Matilde 's fat moves about her gracefully , sighing and rustling with her every gesture . She walks as if enveloped by a dense storm cloud , from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinding as a sunbeam . mme. cochon ON MARKET DAY , children linger in their doorways . They hide tight , bulging fists behind their backs and underneath their aprons . When Matilde sweeps by ; trailing her luxurious rolls of fat behind her , the children shower her . They fling bits of lard , the buttery residue scraped from inside a mother 's churn , the gristle from Sunday dinner 's lamb . The small fistfuls have grown warm and slippery from the children 's kneading , and the air is rich with a comforting , slightly rancid smell . Mme. Cochon , are you hungry ? they whisper as she glides by . Matilde thinks she hears curiosity in their voices . She smiles mildly as she continues on , dodging the dogs that have run out onto the street , snuffling at the scraps . It feels , somehow , like a parade . It feels like a celebration . surprise ONCE , AS MATILDE made her way through the falling fat , she was startled by a peculiar but not unpleasant throb , which originated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other corners of her broad back . She wondered if the children were now hurling soup bones , and made an effort to move more swiftly , but suddenly the joyous barrage slowed to a halt . The children stood absolutely still , lips parted , yellow butter dripping onto their shoes . They stared at her with a curiosity Matilde did not recognize . Hearing a restless fluttering behind her , she twisted about and glimpsed the frayed edges of an iridescent wing . With great caution , she flexed her meaty shoulder blades and to her delight , the wing flapped gaily in response . Matilde had , indeed , fledged two pairs of flimsy wings , the lower pair , folded sleekly about the base of her spine , serving as auxiliary to the grander ones above . flight LEAPING CLUMSILY , all four wings flapping , her fat , like sandbags , threatening to ground her , Matilde greets the air with arms spread wide open . A puff of wind lifts the hem of her skirts , seems to tickle her feet , and Matilde demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the wind harnesses Matilde 's impressive buttocks and dangles her above the cobblestones , above the hungry dogs , above the dirty children with fat melting in their fists . stirring MADELEINE STIRS in her sleep . hush WHEN MADELEINE SLEEPS , Mother says , the cows give double their milk . Pansies sprout up between the floorboards . Your father loves me , but I remain slender and childless . I can hear the tumult of pears and apples falling from the trees like rain . Smooth your sister 's coverlet . Arrange her hair on the pillowcase . Be silent as saints . We do not wish to wake her . madeleine dreams ON DARK MORNINGS , when the church still lay in shadow , Saint Michel looked absent-minded , forlorn , penned in by the lead panes that outlined the sad slope of his jaw . She thought him by far the most heartbreaking of the saints , and occasionally yearned to squeeze the long , waxen fingers that were pressed together so impassibly as they pointed towards heaven . He had been a prince once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mouth closed . In defiance of medieval conventions , even his portraits attest to his hunger : his lips are always ajar , teeth wetly bared , as if about to bite into his tenants ' capons or cheeses or one of their firm daughters . In his castle 's feasting hall , he liked to stage elaborate tableaux vivants , resurrecting the classical friezes he had seen in his travels , himself always cast as the hero or the young god , a bevy of peasant girls enlisted as dryads , pheasants and rank trout imitating eagles and dolphins . Imagine the depravity , the priest whispers : women with nipples as large and purple as plums , birds molting , dead fish suspended from the rafters , and rising in the midst of them all , the achingly glorious Michel , oblivious to the chaos surrounding him . His vanity was unmatched ! penitence AND THEN a PLAGUE STRUCK , a drought descended , and Michel found God . While outside his castle walls the pestilence raged , Michel was struck by the face of the crucified Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs . His fair face had been obliterated by tears and blood ; His perfect body was desiccated and dotted with flies . Wracked by self-reproach , the prince vowed to destroy his own beauty ; he surrendered himself and his lands to the monastery at Rievaulx , where he spent the rest of his days inflicting torture upon himself . He suffered through flagellations , hair shirts , and fasting while the abbot meticulously chronicled his decline : Prince Michel can barely leave his pallet ; his flesh has fallen away ; repeated flaying has reopened and infected old wounds ; his sackcloth has spawned monstrous lesions about his groin . It was as Michel wished . When he finally expired , his face was contorted in anguish , his loveliness effaced by tears and blood . The abbot washed the ravaged body and laid it upon its bier , but by morning the saint had been miraculously restored to perfection , his body whole and sound , his face flawless and somber . This is the Saint Michel depicted in the cathedral window . Even the devout find it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have loved him more , she thought , if he had remained mutilated . recognition ON A SUNDAY IN SUMMER , a blade of empyreal light illuminated his once melancholy face , and she instantly recognized it as her own . Why , it 's me , she said to herself , without wonder . I have been looking at myself all along . And the face was no longer lengthened in sorrow , but bright and fluid with color . She stood up from her family 's pew and walked towards the stained glass , her eyes locked with her own . At the altar , she pivoted on her toes and faced the congregation . Look upon me , she said . Stepping down from the altar , she approached a stout man sitting in the front pew , the collection plate balanced on his knees , and she touched his chest , with all the tenderness in the world . His stiff Sunday vest peeled away like an orange rind , and she grazed her fingertips against the polished , orderly bones of his rib cage . Beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she blew on it , it began to unfurl its sanguine petals , one by one . His heart unfolded before her . She worked her way down each pew , gently touching and blowing as she went , and when she looked around she noticed , with pleasure , that the small flowers she had uncovered were of a heliotropic variety ; their delicate heads nodded to her wherever she went , following her movements like those of the sun . animals THE SMALL , PLIANT SIBLINGS heed Mother 's bidding . Among the morning chores is the task that gives them most delight . First , you must sweep the walkway . After that , you must kiss grandmother 's forehead . You must also lug empty pails to where Papa is milking . Only then are you entrusted with Mother 's heirloom , a hand mirror whose face you hold out to the morning air like a butterfly net , catching the chill in midflight . Madeleine is as still as a mummy , but when they hold the mirror beneath her nose , ghostly shapes appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the results . A rabbit ! Madeleine exhales again : an anteater ! A menagerie of vaporous animals escapes from her nostrils and instantly disappears : the mirror records and erases in the same moment . Jean-Luc captures a whale . Claude , a pregnant sow . Beatrice says that she sees only cows . Do not worry , Maman . Madeleine is still sleeping . she dreams WHEN M. MARAIS ordered a new viol , he requested that the instrument 's head be fashioned after the face of his neighbor 's youngest daughter , Charlotte . She sat diligently before the master craftsman as he whittled away her likeness , until M. Marais was pleased with the result and announced the portrait complete . With the beautiful viol nestled between his thighs , he drew the bow across the strings . It is as if you were singing , he told the girl . This is how I imagine your voice . That is not me , Charlotte declared . That is only my face . I think I will name her Griselda . From then on , whenever she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next door and say hello to her face . Allo , Griselda ! she would exclaim , putting M. Marais terribly out of sorts . the marriage AS SOON AS CHARLOTTE was confirmed , M. Marais visited her father and asked for her hand in marriage . Although the father argued persuasively in favor of Charlotte 's several older sisters , praising one 's graceful figure , another 's delicate needlework , another 's splendid hair , the acclaimed musician would accept none other than Charlotte herself . So the father relinquished her , ruefully , for she was his favorite and he had hoped to spend his old age watching her bloom into womanhood . consummation AT THE NUPTIAL HOUR , the servants passed through Charlotte as if she were a shade , a ghostly emanation of her corporeal groom . For the ceremony , attended only by the master craftsman and her regretful father , she had been dressed in filmy white . She had reflected , like the moon , M. Marais 's bulky and brilliant mass of figured silks , brocades , velvets , rocaille lace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scullery maid and begged directions to the bridal chamber . The oaken door sighed like the entrance to a vault . Quick , quick ! These garters are insufferable ! Through the crack , she could see a naked sliver of M. Marais , flanked by two menservants he was swatting about the head . It 's me , Charlotte , she announced through the opening . How strange it sounded finally to say it . The musician shrieked and clutched himself , girlishly modest , trying to conceal both his breasts and his groin . Go away ! he exclaimed , like a woman shooing hens . Go away this instant ! Charlotte hurriedly shut the door and skittered back a few paces : she imagined that she should feel relief but instead was experiencing a peculiar sense of disappointment . Glancing down , she saw the gaping keyhole . It winked at her , wisely , like a friend . Charlotte knelt , and looked inside . The keyhole was like a telescope , unfolding before her the lush landscape of M. Marais 's body . She spied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nipples peeking out from his breasts , like two rosy cherubs in a cumulus cloud . The menservants had stripped him down to an exoskeleton of garters and restraints , but the more clothes he shed , the less naked he seemed , as if his flesh , freed from its constricting network of laces and stays , could finally embrace him in all its splendor . He stroked his voluptuous stomach and then settled himself , purring , onto the enormous bed . It groaned rapturously beneath him . Unseen , Charlotte 's bright brown eye flickered in the keyhole , wet with pity and desire , guttering like a candle . her wish CLOISTERED IN M. MARAIS 'S ESTATE , Charlotte grew lonely and wistful and depended more and more upon the companionship of her face , Griselda . When the violist took his afternoon nap , Charlotte would steal into his practice rooms and carefully lay the instrument down on its back . Stretching out beside it , she would slide her hands up and down the supine viol , delighting in its smooth expanses and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she traced the fingers of her right hand up and down the viol 's strings , she would , with her left hand , mirror the same movement along her own body , trailing her fingernails from her chin to her mons . I wish , she said to Griselda , that I had strings too . hirsute AS THE LONELY DAYS PASSED , Charlotte silently watched her body sprout resilient black hairs . At first it seemed as if only her brush of pubic hair had run amok , scaling up her stomach like a vine , but one morning , while reading an epistolary novel , she rested a bristling chin on her palm and realized that Griselda was granting her secret wish . By that evening , a dense , furry trail was already creeping up her decolletage . M. Marais , squinting across the lengthy dinner table , was dismayed . inscription THE MUSICIAN methodically withdrew the carving knife from where it burrowed in the turkey 's haunches , which sputtered in protest as he pulled it out . Rising with a sigh , he trundled down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to quiver with his seismic grace . The knife dripped fowl juices onto the tiles , leaving a trail of congealing fat as if M. Marais , like Hansel lost in the woods , might need to find his way back to his seat . Charlotte panted softly . My husband will slice me open , she told herself . And she imagined two identical wounds-the f-holes , the chiseled curves out of which the viol cries-inscribed in her own torso , curling up from her pelvic bones like a sly smile . Her network of organs and intestines would be pinkly exposed , like the wonderful wax anatomical woman she had seen last year at the fair . Charlotte 's fingers began to scrabble at her laces . She could smell M. Marais as he drew nearer-the fermenting scent of the enormously fat-and she bared her stomach , resplendent with black and horse-like hairs . But when her husband seized her , he gripped only her chin , tilting it in the air , maneuvering her head this way and that , and eyed her with the patience of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gullet , and she watched as the shorn hair fell into her lap , plummeting in quick , sad clumps like lead-filled pigeons from the sky . relic AFTER DINNER , the musician retired and Charlotte , as was her habit , sneaked into Griselda 's chambers . The lovely viol languished by the windowsill , and Charlotte crept up on her from behind , her silver sewing scissors glinting in the starlight . Continues ...
