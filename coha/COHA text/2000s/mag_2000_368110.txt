One big goal of the Democratic Convention was to prove that Al Gore has the experience to be President . Not executive experience , but the really important stuff  --  body surfing and mountain climbing , making igloos and cocoa and a dinosaur diorama with the kids , shooting pool and watching Star Trek with Tommy Lee Jones , chasing through the woods with coon dogs in the middle of the night , wrapping a turkey in aluminum foil and roasting it in the fireplace . At this convention , Gore 's image was the thing being cooked inside the shiny wrapper . And the message ? As his old friend Bob Delabar put it Thursday night during a podium discussion of All Things Al , Gore " always seemed to me to be a regular and easygoing fellow . " <P> That 's a stretch . The Vice President is many things , but easy-going is not one of them . He is extraordinarily intense . If Americans decide they want a regular guy in the White House , they 'll elect George W. Bush , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hiding it . The parade of Gore relatives was exhausting and a little pointless ( news flash : Gore 's brother-in-law thinks he 's great ) . But from time to time , the real Gore did come through . During All Things Al , some of the speakers were arrayed on one of those groovy multilevel platforms the 5th Dimension once used to sing Up , Up and Away on shows like the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour . A former Gore aide named Michela Alioto described the Vice President 's management style : " If you had an idea , you 'd e-mail it to him , and he 'd e-mail his response right back . " Now , that 's Al Gore . Barbara Mikulski , the earthy Senator from Maryland , described him as a young politician : " If you thought he was tough as a reporter , you shoulda seen him in Congress ... He wanted those polluters to pay . And I 'll tell you , he was really effective . He wanted to look out for American families . " <P> Have I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The convention did , endlessly , because Gore wants to make a virtue out of his aggression . It worked , as the Regular Guy offensive generally did when it highlighted things about him that are already familiar . The biographical film narrated by Tipper Gore was effective because it showed Gore as a loving family man , and he is that . Best of all , it was a chance to show off photos of Al and Tipper as young marrieds in the 1970s  --  a scruffy hunk and his blond babe . As a 30-year-old woman sitting in the hall was heard to say , " Gore was hot  --  who knew ? "
