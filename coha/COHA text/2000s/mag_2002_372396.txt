This bluesy wallop of an album is filled with songs about grotesques , but there 's no danger of its turning into a rock-opera Winesburg , Ohio . That 's because front man E ( Mark Oliver Everett ) chooses humor over bathos ( " Ma wo n't shave me , Jesus ca n't save me , " he growls on the superb Dog Faced Boy ) . Which is not to say he 's snide ; Friendly Ghost and Woman Driving , Man Sleeping are as sweet as anything in the James Taylor songbook  --  they 're just not saccharine . The lyrics float over an array of power chords , samples , overdubs and scratches  --  no two songs sound alike  --  but it 's not musical bricolage . Just the best album so far this year . <P>  --  J.T.
