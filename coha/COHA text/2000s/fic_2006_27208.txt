Chapter One A Smile for Run-Run There , in old Siam , do you see the boy with dirty ears sitting as proud as a prince on the tall old elephant ? Oh , how those two love each other ! The boy , whose name is Run-Run , sometimes sleeps between the elephant 's front legs , safe from the world . But what a terrible mischief the elephant got that boy into ! It happened on a day like today , hot as an oven with its doors flung open . They were returning from clearing the tangled stumps of aged jackfruit trees for the new mango plantation over on the hillside . The tall elephant would get a stump between his great yellow tusks and shove with his padded forehead . Out came the stump , squealing like a bad tooth . " Walking Mountain ! " the boy shouted with a smile , for that was the elephant 's name . " A morning 's work under this sun is enough , big brother ! Your old bones ache , eh ? Come , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Half a century old , was Run-Run 's elephant , with his final set of teeth ! Walking Mountain had carried the boy 's father on his neck , and his father 's father . Brave mahouts , they commanded elephants many times their size . Mahouts had been Run-Run 's tutors . Now , only half grown , he , too , was a mahout , with his father 's colored headdress packed away under his grandfather 's porcelain amulet . But how many years could Walking Mountainremain on his legs ? One day he would lie down , lame and toothless , and refuse to get up . In the river , Run-Run washed his ears and the red dust out of his hair , as if to avoid a scolding from his mother . He had been barely eight when she was mauled by a tiger . They say she 'd fought the wild creature , even biting off his ear . Someday , Run-Run would meet that great cat , that awful , one-eared beast , and then , watch out , murderer ! " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muttered . " Afraid to venture out of the jungle and show your ugly eyes around here , eh ? " Tight-lipped , he replied to his own question . " Dreamer ! And what if he has been shot dead by a hunter ? Aye , dead and eaten by flies ! " I bless the flies , " he added . Now he gave his head a toss , and his long and black hair wrapped itself around his neck like a wet towel . Run-Run and the tall elephant turned up the road leading to his hillside village . Tucked far below the hazy teak mountains to the north , shady Chattershee would be hard for anyone in the kingdom of Siam to find . No one except the pariah dogs who could be heard barking as Walking Mountain shuffled by ; no one except the fruit bats , the wild green parrots , and a tiger or two . Summer was brief with airless days , bringing heat as fiery as dragon 's breath . Dust rose in clouds like gnats . Nevertheless , Run-Run had smiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around his neck would buy grain for his elephant . Fresh hay , too , brought to the plantation by bullock carts from he knew not where . He 'd slap his noisy coins on the counter and pick out a treat of spindly sugarcanes for his tall friend . And why not a fat , juicy piece of cane for himself , Run-Run , to chew ? Oh , how that great walking mountain could eat ! Two hundred pounds a day . Three hundred ! Hardly a blade of grass was left at the edges of the plowed fields to dine upon . For miles around , plantation elephants had browsed the tree branches up beyond reach . But being so tall , Walking Mountain could stand on his hind legs and stretch himself to amazing length to search out a high mango or luscious fruits dangling on the wild fig trees . " Elephant boy ! " called out the beekeeper , old Bangrak . He sat in the breathless shade of a flame tree . " Look ! Here is a watermelon I grew for you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Run-Run , running his tongue around his lips . " In exchange for what , sir ? " " My wind chimes have n't struck a note in weeks . If I breathe more dust , I 'll spit mud bricks ! Give this road a river splash , eh ? " " Two watermelons , " said Run-Run , for bargaining was as natural to him as breathing . Sometimes a trade in river water arose out of the choking April dust . He would be sorry to see the monsoon rains come and put his splendid business at an end . " Did you say two melons ? " " Indeed , sir . " " Thief ! " The old man wagged a dried hand in front of his face as if to clear a swirl of dust . Said Run-Run , " I am ashamed of myself ! Nevertheless , a melon for Walking Mountain . Another for me . " " Prince of rascals ! " " Two watermelons , large and sweet , or good-bye , friend of my father , " the elephant boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , old Bangrak gave a snarl in disgust , but with a smile tucked into his white beard . For him , too , bargaining was a skill and an entertainment to be admired . It was relentless bargaining that had allowed him to send his son off to the city and to school . It was rumored that the boy could already read and write . Such an achievement was the talk of the village . " Two watermelons are too much ! " Old Bangrak insisted . " Three would be more to my liking , " said Run-Run . " Scamp ! Two ! It is agreed ! " Run-Run called to his elephant . " Give an ear , Walking Mountain ! To the river , magnificent one ! " Run-Run climbed to the elephant 's neck and took his familiar place . With a light touch of the bull hook left to him by his father , Run-Run turned the elephant toward the river below . " Go ! " There Walking Mountain filled his long trunk with water . He hardly needed a command from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After several trips the red dust was settling over the road like a fresh coat of paint . Continues ...
