1 <p> Rachel and I tumbled into the tall grass at the bottom of the hill , having survived yet another Daddy-just-one-more sled ride from the edge of our front porch . I collapsed on my back , trying to find oxygen between gasps of laughter , and looked up at the summer sky . My daughter , with limbs sprawled in a wide X and her head against my foot , shouted her delight toward the house . " We did it ! We made it ! " <p> Seconds before , airborne and soaring toward record distance , Rachel reached for an octave above the normal human voice range , squealing a note that rang on in my head , and I suspected invited half the neighborhood 's canine population to play . I laughed and put my fingers in my ears , rolling them in an exaggerated twist as if she 'd deafened me . <p> She moved to lay her head upon my chest and quieted herself there , listening to my racing heart . <p> I stroked her hair , inhaled the scent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tickle of green . <p> " Is it okay ? " she asked . <p> " It 's okay . " <p> " It 's too fast , " she said , raising herself up and pushing a bony elbow into my gut . <p> " Oh , so now you 're the doctor . " <p> She smiled . " Someday , " she said . " For now , you 're the doctor . " <p> " Do n't worry . I 'm okay . " I scowled at my seven-year-old . " Really . " <p> We rested together , staring at the sky full of clouds of hippopotami , horses , rockets  --  whatever Rachel imagined . Mostly I gasped and oohed . In a moment I found myself blinking away tears , overwhelmed with the enormity of it all . <p> It was so ordinary . A summer Saturday morning without an agenda . It 's hard for me to describe beyond the sense I had of emerging , as if I 'd been submerged for so long , and now , just to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would burst my heart . I smiled , taking it in , gulping in ordinary life as if I 'd never have a chance again . <p> As Rachel chatted on with her running commentary of sky castles , fiery dragons , and fairies , other images drifted through my mind , pictures of painful chapters that set my current joy into sharp contrast . Traveling with Joanne through the dark tunnel of postpartum depression . My mother 's battle with cancer . Memories of an intensive care unit visit while I was the too-young patient , watching my own heart monitor and wondering if life would be cut short . <p> Joanne 's voice swept me into the here and now . " What 's going on ? " <p> I looked up to see her standing on the covered porch , eyeing a bottle of vegetable oil that was set on the white railing . <p> Rachel lifted her head , her blond hair dotted with grass seed . " We 're sledding , Mommy . " <p> Joanne 's hands rested firmly on her hips . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottle . " And I 've been looking for this . " She was serious , but her eyes betrayed her attempt at scolding me . Her happiness at my delight in our little Rachel could n't be spoiled by my summer antics . <p> I exchanged a mischievous glance with Rachel . She betrayed me in a heartbeat . " It was Daddy 's idea . " <p> " Women ! " I said , grabbing my daughter by the waist and swinging her around in a circle . " You always stick together ! " <p> As I trudged up the hill with Rachel folded around my back , I grunted exaggerated puffs . " You 're getting so big . " <p> I set her on the top step and kissed her forehead . She started pulling away . " Wait . " I picked at the seeds in her hair . " You 'll need to brush this out . " <p> She opted for the shake-it-out method . " I 'm a rock star . " <p> I smiled . My star . For Joanne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us stick together through a valley of misery . <p> Joanne reappeared , carrying lemonade in tall , sweaty glasses . She handed me one and kissed me . She had thin lips to go with sharp , elegant features , dark eyes alight with mystery , and hair the color of caramel . She could have been a model before big lips became the rage . <p> I 'd been to hell and back with Joanne , but the last six months , I 'd sensed a real change in her . She seemed settled , somehow . Content . More romantic toward me  --  the way she had been back in my medical school days . Our relationship , once teetering on the precipice of divorce , was now solidly a safe distance from the edge . I 'd seen significant pieces of my life 's puzzle fall together in the last few years . When the marriage one finally clicked into place , everything else brightened with it . It was as if I 'd been living my life in black-and-white and someone just invented color . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There seemed a surface calm , but I sensed a deeper stirring . I 'd become a champion at reading her . I knew the quiet of her bitterness , the bubbly way she prattled on when she felt guilty , and the aloofness that dared me to pursue her into bed . For a moment our eyes met . It was only a flash , but in that instant , I felt the foreboding that threatened my wonderful ordinary-life euphoria . <p> I took her hand . " What 's up ? " <p> She lowered her voice , but even at that volume , sharp irritation cut at the edges of her words , clipping them into little fragments . " Your father . " <p> I raised my eyebrows in question . <p> " His neighbor called . " <p> I waited for more , but it seemed the silence only uncapped her annoyance . In a moment she was on the verge of tears . <p> " He always does this . Every time we have plans , he has a crisis . " <p> Plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I started to protest , but she interrupted , pushing her finger against my lips . " You know they 're going to announce that you 've made partner . " <p> I smiled . Partner . A year early . Just reward for the practice 's highest revenue producer nine months in a row . Another puzzle piece in my wonderful life about to connect . <p> " Which neighbor ? " <p> " That Somali family , " she said , flipping her hand in the air . " A woman . She has an accent . She said his place is a wreck . He 's ill . " She seemed to hesitate before adding . " He 's asking for you . " <p> It was my father 's way . The crab fisherman would n't pick up the phone and let me know he needed me . He sent word around the block and expected me to show . " Define ' ill . ' " <p> Joanne imitated the neighbor 's accent . " Mister Gus is n't eating . He toilets in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbor meant , I knew it could n't be good . I walked into the house to my study and picked up the phone . I was listening to the endless ringing on the other end when Joanne entered . " Not a good sign , " I said . " He does n't pick up . " <p> " What are we going to do ? " <p> I looked at my wife . Petite . Strong . And so able to read my thoughts . <p> She threw up her hands . " We 're going to the shore , " she said . " Just like that . " <p> I nodded . I was predictable . Family first . We had to go . <p> She glared at me . I read the silence , loud and clear . That 's why I love you ... and hate you . <p> " I 'll call Jim . The practice will understand . " <p> Joanne shook her head . " This is your night , David . The moment you 've been waiting for . And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't say anything . She had me pegged . <p> " I 'll see if Kristine will take Rachel for the weekend . " <p> " Let 's take her with us . " <p> Joanne 's face hardened . " With us ? That place is so ... "  --  she paused , apparently mulling over adjective options  --  " crusty . " <p> It was the gentlest description of several other options that came to mind . <p> " We 'll take care of the crisis and stay at that seaside bed and breakfast . It will be fun . A chance for her to see her grandfather . " I let a hopeful smile tease at the corners of my lips . " Even if he is crusty , he does adore her . " <p> Joanne sighed in resignation . " Yes , he does . " She tipped her glass against mine . " As long as we do n't have to sleep there , " she said , shivering as if that thought was horrifying . She gave me a **26;720;TOOLONG look . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the porch and into the humidity we Virginians call summer . As I called for Rachel , I followed the border of the house , my prize lawn soft beneath my bare feet . From her perch on the back deck , my daughter ambushed me with open arms . <p> " Can we sled some more ? " <p> I looked at the blue sky and my Southern Living home , and I pushed aside a fleeting presence . A ripple beneath the calm . <p> I 'd been through too many hard times to trust the peace . Nothing this great can last forever . <p> " We 're going to Grandpa Conners ' , " I said , trying my best to sound excited . <p> Rachel wrinkled her nose . To her , the shore meant stinky crabs and everything smelling fishy . <p> I poked her nose with a finger . " You 're too much like your mother . " <p> She poked me back . " You 're too much like your father . " <p> A sudden breeze lifted Rachel 's hair against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distance , a small thundercloud hung over the horizon . Not today . I do n't want to travel the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel in the rain . <p> My daughter squeezed my neck , bringing a smile to my face and pushing my anxieties aside . I nestled my face into her hair , trying to find an earlobe . She giggled , and everything seemed right again. 2009 by Harry Kraus <p> 2 <p> Joanne packed in a rush , throwing in enough clothes for one night . I added my medical bag and swimwear for myself and Rachel , slipping in her little fishing rod and reel on the sly , hoping to escape from family obligations with Dad long enough to hear Rachel 's delight over reeling in a croaker or if we were lucky , a catfish or two . <p> With our sights set on the Eastern Shore of Virginia , we left our suburban home west of Richmond by eleven . By noon we were sitting at a picnic table outside Pierce 's Pit Barbeque near Williamsburg . <p> Joanne wiped Carolina Red sauce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those clouds . " <p> To the east , fluffy popcorn clouds darkened the sky above the pines . I grunted a response and shoved the last of a shredded pork barbecue sandwich home . The clouds bothered me , too . I 'd seen the tenacity of storms coming off the Chesapeake , and I did n't like the idea of being over the water on the lonely twenty-three mile bay bridge-tunnel between Norfolk and the Eastern Shore . But my job , as chauvinistic as it sounded , was to offer a rock solid reassurance to my women . " Not to worry , " I said . " They come up fast and burn out fast . We 'll be fine . " <p> A distant rumble punctuated the end of my sentence . Joanne raised her eyebrows at me and stayed quiet for Rachel 's sake . <p> " Jim says they 'll miss us for dinner , " I said . <p> Joanne smiled . " I 'm sure he 'll drink enough to make up for all of us . " <p> I chuckled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a savvy businessman and a competent physician , but I worried that his liver would die before he did . When I told him this , he joked it would likely last forever , as often as he 'd drowned the organ in pickling juice . <p> I remembered the uncomfortable moment like it happened yesterday . I had put my hand on his shoulder . " Are you really okay ? " <p> His face reddened above his silk tie . " Mind your own business , " he 'd said , ending the conversation . <p> Joanne gathered our trash and looked at Rachel . " Let 's use the ladies ' room . Last stop before Grandpa 's house . " <p> Rachel closed her lips around a straw and pulled noisily at the last of her soda . <p> I watched them go and stood to take a better look at the sky . Having grown up in a small fishing town on " the shore , " as we called it , I turned my eyes constantly to the horizon . It was second nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indoor occupation as a family physician . <p> Moments later we were on our way again , east on Interstate 64 and moving shoulder to shoulder with a steady flow of Virginians escaping to the beach . <p> Joanne fretted in heavy traffic and liked it even less when the rain started . Soon the isolated plunk , plunk , plunk , closed together into a steady rhythm . I turned on the wipers and glanced at my wife . She needed something else to think about . " Why do n't you call ahead to the Bayside Bed and Breakfast ? " <p> I squinted through the windshield and frowned , noticing a fraction too late that I was about to pass my exit . I changed lanes quickly , a maneuver that rocked my Ford Explorer and prompted an expletive from Joanne . " Look out ! " she screamed . <p> A horn blared . An old red convertible with the top down pulled up beside us , all occupants screaming . Three angry white men , with their hands in the air , lifted a redneck welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backseat , a tattooed man seated beside a surfboard , clasped his hands together as if carrying a handgun and jerked his arms back and forth as if experiencing a handgun 's recoil . <p> " Idiots , " I muttered . " Do n't look at them . " I bolstered my bravado by laughing at their predicament . " Looks like they ca n't put the top up because of the surfboard . " <p> " You almost hit them . " <p> " I know . " I hesitated . " Blind spot . " Inside , I cringed . I did n't enjoy being the cause of conflict . I glanced in the rearview mirror and wished for a Rolaids . <p> We exited toward the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel , a manmade wonder crossing above and below miles of open water near the mouth of the Atlantic Ocean . Behind us , the red convertible followed . From the front , the bumper and grille heaved forward with menacing shiny braces exposed in a snarl of chrome . I watched as he nestled in behind me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tapped the steering wheel and shifted my eyes from the road to the mirror , fighting the churning anxiety in my gut . <p> I glanced at Joanne . At least for the moment , she ignored me . I wished I had n't eaten that second barbeque . <p> The red car hugged my bumper . He followed for two blocks , then pulled off , engine revving , likely seeking refuge from the pounding rain . <p> I took a deep breath and turned to see that Rachel had fallen asleep . Oh , to be that trusting , I thought . <p> Joanne folded her flip phone . " No service . " <p> " Maybe it 's the storm . " <p> She sighed . <p> I squeezed her hand . I love you . <p> She did n't squeeze back . <p> The rain picked up again before the first tunnel . The bay churned white beneath us . I suspected the water gushing onto my SUV was at least half bay , half rain , a miserable recipe for corrosion . <p> In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we exited the tunnel , and my alarm grew as we began to cross the open water . I squinted ahead , looking for the safety of the next island . Just before the start of the second tunnel , the storm accelerated , and wind gusts forced me to a crawl . Once on the man-made island , with my wipers set to frantic , I pulled into a parking lot with the others seeking safety off the open bridge . <p> Five minutes later the red convertible reappeared , top up , surfboard jutting from the trunk . The three angry men stopped directly behind me , at a right angle to us , hemming us in . Faces to the windows , they leered at us through the downpour . <p> My eyes studied the rearview mirror . Joanne turned around and cursed under her breath . I double-checked the locks and waited . <p> There we sat , each second stretched unmercifully by our circumstance . My chest tightened . I wiped my forehead and forced a smile at Joanne , an implant I was certain she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slackened . I wanted the license plate number but could n't get it since I had only a view of the side of the car . I studied the vehicle , wishing I knew cars . It was old . Beautiful and restored . High back fins bordered the trunk . I guessed late fifties , a Chevy perhaps , with paint too new for its owner to tolerate a dent . <p> I started the SUV , flashed my brakes , and put it in reverse to warn the driver I meant business . <p> The red car sat there . I backed up an inch . Then two . <p> " What are you doing ? " Joanne whispered . <p> " I want him to move . " <p> I backed a total of two feet , until my bumper must have been nearly kissing his car . He sat there , unmoving , daring me to continue . <p> Joanne pleaded , " Stop . " <p> I looked ahead , judging the distance between the front of my Ford and the concrete wall  --  a secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided the foundation for the man-made island . " Hang on . " <p> I shifted into drive , cut hard to the left , and gunned the accelerator , hopping over a concrete wheel stopper intended to keep me from parking too close to the wall . My front bumper scraped the wall , but my momentum was enough . We completed the turn and fishtailed into the wet parking lot . <p> My evasive move took my nemesis by surprise . I sped across the parking lot and onto the bridge road , with lightning flashing and the red convertible dead on its wheels . Inside the tunnel I pushed the accelerator , rocketing past the speed limit  --  pushing eighty , ninety , and then one hundred miles per hour . Fortunately , traffic in the tunnel was sparse . Changing lanes in the tunnel was illegal , but I was jazzed and afraid . I had no idea what kind of drug or psychosis was driving the man in the red convertible , and I had little interest in finding out . <p> Weaving around slower traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain again and tangled in traffic . I made four passes , one around a large delivery truck emblazoned with a large blue crab . In the mirror there was no sign of the red convertible . <p> I slowed the SUV , dared my heart to do the same , and glanced at Joanne . She was pale , eyes closed and knuckles whitened around the shoulder strap . " It 's okay , " I said . " He 's not following us . " <p> Joanne uncurled her fingers from their death grip on the seatbelt harness . <p> The storm slackened , with the rain soon a nuisance drizzle . I glanced around at Rachel . She slept with her arms around Bobo , her little stuffed Pound Puppy . I was amazed that she could sleep through such craziness . I stole a second look , savoring the air of peacefulness around her . My eyes landed on Bobo . He struck me as a bit scary . With one missing eye , the remaining one seemed to stare blankly ahead , boring into me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm and those crazy men in the red convertible . <p> We drove in silence , exhausted from the rain or rednecks or both . I tried to recapture some optimism about my wonderful life , but my earlier mood had been destroyed . The suddenness of our trip , the storm , the inoperable cell phone , and the red convertible all combined forces against us . <p> It was weird in a heavy sort of way . I 'm not suspicious by nature , but I felt weighted by our experience . I could n't admit it , but I knew Joanne sensed it , too . " I want to go home , " she said , gripping my hand . <p> " We 'll be fine , " I said , unconvinced . " The storm 's over . " I pointed up the road . " Look , here we are . Wake up Rachel .
