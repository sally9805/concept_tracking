// IT COULD N'T HAVE HAPPENED at a worse moment . The men had set off in their scouting parties after Tatanka , Uncle Buffalo . Only women , old people and boys like Iktomi remained behind in the Sicangu Lakota camps . Soon the camps , too , would be on the move . But before the lodges could be taken down and packed up for the journey , Mato came . The bear . Heca was the first to see it . He and some of the other small boys had been among the cottonwoods , hunting rabbits , when the great black beast had roared out its challenge . No one had ever seen boys run so fast . But when they raced into the camp circle , shouting for their fathers , who was there to greet them ? MATO HAD RUMBLED into the camp , bellowing and tearing apart anything within her path . The beast destroyed five lodges before the people managed to drive her away with stones and shouts . Afterward , stunned women and weeping children staggered around , wondering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night Mato emerged from the forest , roaring her defiance . First she attacked the pony herd , slashing and scattering the animals . As the people fled in terror , Mato turned toward the camp . Her sharp claws ripped apart the heavy hides covering the lodges . She overturned drying racks . She chased small children from their beds and scattered brave-hearted women . Only old Sunhpala , a scarred werrior of nearly 70 winters , stood and fought The old man flung his lance at the great hairy creature , but Mato easily knocked it aside . The animal then fell upon the old man and crushed him as a boy might snap a twig . Iktomi had only marked 12 winters upon the earth . He had been considered too small to go with his age mates to hold horses for the hunters . Now he and Maga were the oldest boys remaining in camp . While the old men sat and smoked , planning what to do next , Iktomi knew he and Maga had to face the bear . " Man 's road can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warned before leaving for the buffalo hunt . " Soon you will put your feet upon that road . " IT HAD HAPPENED SOONER than either could have imagined . Only two ponies remained nearby , and it would be at least a day before the others were recovered . The elders turned the ponies over to two other boys who rode off to seek help . The remaining people mourned the death of old Sunhpala and considered what else to do . " It 's not for these old men to defend the camp , " Iktomi told Maga . " This is our test . We should go and face Mato . " Maga laughed . Iktomi had never been best at anything . In footraces , he had always been near the last . Almost all the others their age had pulled a man 's bow before he had . And now the stone-faced boy with the serious eyes was talking about fighting a bear ! " Better to wait for the men to return , " Maga declared . " They 'll be back soon . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Your mother ? My sisters ? " MAGA HUNG HIS HEAD . Iktomi motioned toward the cottonwoods . It was n't an impossible task , Iktomi told himself . After all , the boys had strong lances . You needed swift feet only if you planned to run away He did n't . No boy could ever stand up to a bear in a test of strength , but that was n't his plan . The best hunters were patient , and who was more patient than Iktomi , the spider ? " How will we do it ? " Maga asked . " First we will follow Mato 's trail and find her den , " Iktomi explained . " Then we 'll make the appropriate prayers . Wakantanka will tell us what to do . " Maga shook his head and muttered to himself . He followed , though . The boys had little difficulty tracing the path of the bear through the forest . Mato had torn through the greening plants like a cyclone . It seemed odd to Iktomi , this furious attack on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cottonwood trees , with Mato nearby Why should the beast attack now ? He soon had his answer . As the boys approached a clearing , they detected the mouth of a cave . Close by were two small cubs . One of the cubs limped awkwardly The broken shaft of a boy 's hunting arrow rested in its right hind leg . So it was n't Mato who had struck first . Heca had not told the whole story A ROAR FROM BEHIND THEM annnunced the annearance of Mato . Maga instinctively sought the refuge of the nearest cottonwood . Iktomi turned and faced the angry bear . He looked helplessly at his lance . Even his father could not be certain to kill a bear as large as the one in front of him now And what benefit would the people have from the death of this creature ? Had n't his father taught him how important it was to maintain the sacred harmony of the world ? Mato was doing no more than protecting her family . Was n't that what Iktomi was doing ? " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have no quarrel . " As Mato thundered closer , Maga cried out in alarm . " Do n't you see ? " Iktomi asked . " She was only protecting her cubs . " Iktomi remembered an old chant , sung by his grandfather when they had gone hunting rabbits five long summers before . The boy sang it . He held his empty hands out to each side , closed his eyes , and sang the chant a second time . " Mato , give me your power . Let me walk the world in harmony with all things . " The bear paused before the boy . Cautiously the animal reached out with a paw and touched Iktomi 's bare chest . The boy shuddered , but he forced himself to remain still . He opened his eyes and studied the power and strength of the animal before him . " We have brought disharmony to this place , " Iktomi said , sighing . " Forgive us , Mato . " MATO 'S SHARP CLAWS TORE the flesh of Iktomi 's shoulder but only a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The boy winced but refused to cry out . Mato appeared satisfied . She turned back toward the clearing and joined her cubs . When the boys returned to the camp , they were met by cries of alarm . Iktomi 's mother raced over . " What 's happened ? " Gnaska , one of the elders , asked . " We have made peace , " Iktomi announced . It was Maga , though , who told the story The others listened with wonder and amazement . Only Heca , who had started it all , shrank from sight . " It 's a wise man who can judge what 's required and provide it , " Gnaska observed . " We will make the appropriate prayers and restore the harmony of the world . Tomorrow , when the ponies are all back , we will set out after the hunters . " After the others had left to resume breaking down their lodges , Gnaska took Iktomi aside . " It 's good the people have strong hearts among their young men , " the old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claw . " Mato has left her mark on you so that we can be reminded of her power . " Iktomi nodded somberly . Then he smiled . // <p>
