Life as a 13-year-old is hard . There is a lot of responsibility . Everyone wants you to be perfect . Some people want you to get a job at the age of 13 . Thirteen is the beginning of a different stage of life . <P> When you 're 13 , your interest in girls changes . You start wanting them to do stuff for you . Plus , your girlfriend has to be pretty . Also , she has to know how to fight because I do n't want her to be getting punked and then I have to jump in . So that 's what I pretty much like in a girl . <P> At 13 most teens like sports . They want to be the best on the team , but there is always somebody better than you . I like to play basketball the most because all you have to do is put the ball in the basket . Football I like because you get to hit people that are talking trash . The only way you can get to play sports is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very hard at school . I have to be bad in order to be considered cool . I sometimes do things that are n't good . I have talked back to my teachers and been disrespectful to them . I do want to be good , but it 's just too hard . Since I 've been in junior high , I have been to four different schools . Some schools really tried to help me , but I had been suspended so many times they just had to kick me out . I go to a school now that I like , and I 'm really trying to do better . It 's still hard because I do n't know anybody . I want to go back to my old schools so I can see my friends graduate .
