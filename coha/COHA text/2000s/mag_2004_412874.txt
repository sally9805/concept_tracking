THE NEW FEDERAL ANTISPAM LAW DOES N'T SEEM TO BE WORKING . WILL ANYTHING STOP THE E-MAIL ONSLAUGHT ? // ON JANUARY 1 , 2004 , the most sweeping federal antispam law ever enacted took effect . Coauthor Senator Conrad Burns ( R-Montana ) said that CAN-SPAM ( Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing , the bill 's full name ) was supposed to " put an end to the bothersome e-mail people see each day in their in-boxes " by imposing harsh penalties against " kingpin " spammers and by allowing people to opt out of marketing mailing lists with a simple mouse click . But if you 're receiving less junk e-mail now , you are in the minority . By all accounts , CAN-SPAM has failed to restrain the inundation of spam that is slowly drowning the Internet . Brightmail , which filters spam for some 300 million user accounts worldwide , reports that in January 60 percent of incoming e-mail messages worldwide was spam-up 2 percent from the levels observed in December , just before the law took effect . Photograph SENATOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end to the bothersome e-mail people see each day in their in-boxes. " // Perhaps the most striking consequence of the law is that it may have driven a number of spammers offshore . America Online , whose 33 million customers have long been a major target for spammers , says that immediately after the law took effect , it saw a 10 percent jump in spam originating overseas-beyond the reach of U.S. antispam laws . IT 'S THE LAW CAN-SPAM REQUIRES COmmercial e-mail messages to include an opt-out mechanism so you can tell senders to remove you from their mailing list . Also outlawed are false and deceptive headers and subject lines . Companies must include a postal address in their marketing e-mail . MX Logic , a self-described " commercial e-mail defense company , " determined that of 40,000 unsolicited commercial e-mail messages it reviewed in a four-week survey , 97 percent violated the CAN-SPAM law . The most common violations , MX Logic officials say , involved failing to include a valid postal address or a clear opt-out mechanism . The law also bans popular spamming techniques such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Prohibited , as well , is " dictionary attack " software , which randomly generates e-mail addresses in an effort to come up with at least A some real recipients . The toughest penalties under CAN-SPAM include jail time for spammers who falsify the header information in e-mail messages or who hack into someone else 's computer to send bulk e-mail . Convicted spammers are also subject to jail time for registering five or more e-mail accounts , for giving false information when signing up for those accounts , or for using the accounts to send unsolicited bulk e-mail . Burns and various CAN-SPAM supporters-among them Microsoft , Yahoo , and the telecom consumer advocacy group Telecommunications Research and Action Center-say that the law 's steep fines and jail terms will , in time , weed out the worst offenders . They say that CAN-SPAM will make junk e-mail easier to spot and filter . But spammers seem to be paying little attention to the law . STRONG FIRST STEP ? EVEN THOUGH spam is as rampant as ever , Burns remains optimistic about the new law . He says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he also points out that CAN-SPAM was n't meant to be a spamslaying silver bullet . " The industry now has a way to legitimize and put integrity into the practice of sending commercial e-mail , " he says . " CAN-SPAM is great for companies like ours that play by the rules , " contends Paul McDonnell , cofounder of direct e-mail marketer IMarket Offers . He and many other e-mail marketers appreciate that CAN-SPAM presents a single set of rules to an industry previously struggling to navigate the shoals of 34 existing state antispam laws . " This makes compliance much easier , " McDonnell says . But what is good for the e-marketing industry may not be great for the eternally spammed . The CAN-SPAM law does not proscribe unsolicited e-mail , so long as it 's CAN-SPAM-compliant . Critics view this as a major flaw , while known spammers see it as a loophole that will keep them in business . Scott Richter , whose name regularly appears on the Register of Known Spam Operations list of top spammers ( see find.pcwprld.com/40988 ) , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All I have to do is add my postal address to outbound e-mail messages , and it is business as usual . " California state senator Debra Bowen , a Democrat who supported a more stringent California law that the federal law superseded , says the situation has deteriorated . " CAN-SPAM does not can spam at all ; it gives it the congressional seal of approval , " she asserts . California 's antispam law mandated an opt-in approach that prohibited sending unsolicited commercial e-mail without the recipients ' prior consent or without an established business relationship . Bowen argues that marketing e-mail should be prohibited unless it is requested by users . WAIT AND SEE " CAN-SPAM 'S IMPACT on consumer in-boxes will take time , " says J. Howard Beales III , director of the FTC 's Bureau of Consumer Protection , which is among the federal agencies charged with enforcing the CAN-SPAM Act . The FTC has other obligations under CAN-SPAM . One is that the agency must write regulations governing the labeling of pornographic messages . It must consider mandatory labels for unsolicited e-mail in general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do-not-spam registry similar to the telemarketing do-not-call registry . The FTC has proposed requiring adult-related e-mail to have the phrase " **25;6482;TOOLONG " at the beginning of message subject lines , making them easy for recipients to filter out . The problem with this and other CAN-SPAM mandates , from Beales 's point of view , involves enforcement . " I have expressed some doubts about the enforceability of CAN-SPAM , " Beales says . Spammers are difficult to locate , and if they 're found outside the United States , enforcement becomes even more difficult . " Without strict enforcement , I do n't see how any antispam law can work , " says Sam Simon , chair of the Telecommunications Research and Action Center , a supporter of CAN-SPAM . According to Beales , the ETC has filed nearly 60 antispam cases under antifraud laws , yet the volume of spam has continued to rise .

Howard Beales III , director of the FTC 's Bureau of Consumer Protection . // EXISTING LAWS ONE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , New York 's state attorney general Eliot Spitzer and Microsoft sued Scott Richter and his company OptInRealBig.com in New York and Washington states , respectively , alleging that they had violated each state 's consumer protection laws by sending billions of illegal and deceptive unsolicited e-mail messages . Richter , who insists that the charges are false , says he lost some business initially but now sends as many e-mail messages as he did before the suits were filed . Many observers view laws as just one element in fighting spam . " We feel that the CAN-SPAM law will , when combined with other tools and weapons , have a positive impact , " says America Online spokesperson Nicholas Graham . Analysts agree better spamfighting technology ( see " Tech Weapons of Spam Destruction " ) is needed . The research firm IDC estimates that by 2007 messaging security will be a $1.1 billion business , up from $236 million in 2002 . " Spam laws on their own mean nothing , " says Richi Jennings , e-mail analyst with Ferris Research . " Any solution will have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BY RAMON G.
