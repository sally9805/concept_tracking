BETTY RUFFLE ELLlCOTT CITY , MARYLAND Note : For testing purposes only , we used Classico di Napoli Tomato &; Basil pasta sauce . Sidebar Cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When preparing pasta for a casserole , keep in mind that it will continue to cook in the oven . * Save those extra bits and pieces of cheese to shred and toss with pasta . Shredded cheese , as well as pasta , absorbs liquid from the sauce , so add at the last minute to prevent the dish from drying out . * Fry leftover cooked pasta ( without sauce ) in a small amount of oil in a nonstick skillet . Like hash brown potatoes , the noodles will become crisp and golden brown on the outside and soft and tender on the inside . * Pantry ingredients , such as canned artichokes , roasted red bell peppers , sun-dried tomatoes , and olives , are great for spur-of-the-moment pasta creations . * Fire up the flavor of commercial marinara sauce with hot and spicy salsa or a dash of dried crushed red pepper flakes . Just before serving , toss in a handful of finely chopped fresh vegetables for texture , or whisk in a little light cream cheese or sour cream for richness . Sidebar Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to three days or frozen for up to one month . Prepare pasta according to package directions , cooking for the minimum amount of time ; drain and rinse under cold running water . Toss pasta with a splash of olive oil , or lightly coat with vegetable cooking spray to prevent the strands from sticking together . Place in a zip-top plastic freezer bag , and refrigerate or freeze . When ready to serve , remove the cold or frozen pasta from the bag , and drop into a large pot of rapidly boiling water , stirring just until hot ( about 1 to 3 minutes ) . Drain and use as desired . // <p>
