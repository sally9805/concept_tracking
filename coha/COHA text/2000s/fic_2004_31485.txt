Chapter One " It 's a halyard . " " No , it 's a stay . T'e headstay . " The thirty-meter schooner Ima Hooker swooped closehauled into aquamarine swells so perfect they might have been drawn from a painting by the semimythical Maxfield Parrish . Overhead , the rigging sang in a faint but steady breeze . That gentle zephyr , smelling faintly of brine , was the only relief for the sweltering figures on her deck . Julian mopped his brow and pointed to the offending bit of rigging . " Look , there 's a rope- " " A line , " Poertena corrected pedantically . " Okay , there 's a line and a pulley- " " T'at 's a block . Actually , it 's a deadeye . " " Really ? I thought a block was one of those with cranks . " " No , t'at 's a windlass . " Six other schooners kept formation on Hooker . Five of them were identical to the one on whose deck Julian and Poertena stood : low , trim hulls with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a " topsail schooner rig . " What that meant was that each mast carried a " gaff sail , " a fore-and-aft sail cut like a truncated triangle with its head set from an angled yard-the " gaff " - while the foremast also carried an entire set of conventional square sails . The after gaff sail-the " mainsail , " Julian mentally corrected ; after all , he had to get something right-had a boom ; the forward gaff sail did not . Of course , it was called the foresail whereas the lowest square sail on that mast was called the " fore course , " which struck him as a weird name for any sail . Then there were the " fore topsail , " " fore topgallant , " and " fore royal , " all set above the fore course . The second mast ( called the " mainmast " rather than the " aftermast , " for some reason Julian did n't quite understand , given that the ship had only two masts to begin with and that it carried considerably less canvas than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but compensated by setting a triangular " leg of mutton " fore-and-aft sail above the mainsail . There were also staysails set between the masts , not to mention a flying jib , outer jib , and inner jib , all set between the foremast and the bowsprit . The seventh schooner was different-a much bigger , less agile , somehow unfinished-looking vessel with a far deeper hull and no less than five masts-and , at the insistence of Captain Armand Pahner , Imperial Marines , rejoiced in the name of Snarleyow . The smaller , more nimble ships seemed to regard their larger sister with mixed emotions . No one would ever have called Snarleyow anything so gauche as clumsy , perhaps , but she was clearly less fleet of foot , and her heavier , more deliberate motion almost seemed to hold the others back . All of the ships carried short-barreled cannon along their sides . Snarleyow mounted fifteen of them to a side , which gave her a quarter again the broadside armament of any of her consorts , but all of them carried a single , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well . And every single one of them had ropes everywhere . Which was the problem . " Okay . " Julian drew a deep breath , then continued in a tone of massive calm . " There 's a line and a pu-block . So why is n't it a halyard ? " " Halyard hauls up t'e sail . T'e stay , it hold t'e pocking mast up . " The Pinopan had grown up around the arcane terminology of the sea . In fact , he was the only human member of the expedition ( with the exception of Roger , who had spent summers in Old Earth 's blue-water recreational sailing community ) who actually understood it at all . But despite the impression of landsmen-that the arcana existed purely to cause them confusion-there was a real necessity for the distinct terminology . Ships constantly encounter situations where clear and unambiguous orders may mean the difference between life and death . Thus the importance of being able to tell hands to pull upon a certain " rope " in a certain way . Or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while maintaining tension . Thus such unambiguous and unintelligible orders as " Douse the mainsail and make fast ! " Which does not mean throw water on it to increase speed . " So which one 's the halyard ? " Julian asked plaintively . " Which halyard ? Countin ' t'e stays'ils , t'ere 's seventeen pocking halyards on t'is ship .... " Hooker 's design had been agreed upon as the best possible for the local conditions . She and her consorts had been created , through human design and local engineering , to carry Prince Roger and his bodyguards-now augmented by various local forces-across a previously unexplored ocean . Not that there had n't , as always , been the odd , unanticipated circumstance requiring last-minute improvisation . The fact that a rather larger number of Mardukan allies than originally anticipated had been added to Roger 's force had created the need for more sealift capacity . Especially given the sheer size of the Mardukan cavalry 's mounts . Civan were fast , tough , capable of eating almost anything , and relatively intelligent . One thing they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since the cavalrymen who rode into battle on their backs averaged between three and three and a half meters tall . Carrying enough of them to sea aboard the six original schooners had turned out to be impossible once the revised numbers of local troopers had been totaled up . So just when everyone had thought they were done building , they-and somewhere around a quarter of the total shipbuilding force of K'Vaern 's Cove-had turned to to build the Snarleyow . Fortunately , the local labor force had learned a lot about the new building techniques working on the smaller ships , but it had still been a backbreaking , exhausting task no one had expected to face . Nor had Poertena been able to spend as much time refining her basic design , which was one reason she was ugly , slabsided , and slow , compared to her smaller sisters . She was also built of green timber , which had never been seasoned properly and could be expected to rot with dismaying speed in a climate like Marduk 's . But that was all right with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about was that she last long enough for a single voyage . Although she was scarcely in the same class for speed or handiness as Poertena 's original , twin-masted design , Snarleyow was still enormously more efficient than any native Mardukan design . She had to be . The nature of the local weather was such that there was an almost unvarying wind from the northeast , yet that was the very direction in which the ships had to sail . That was the reason for their triangular sails . Their fore-and-aft rig-a technology the humans had introduced-made it possible for them to sail much more sharply into the wind than any local vessel , with its clumsy and inefficient , primitive square-rigged design , had ever been able to do . Similar ships had sailed the seas of Earth all the way up to the beginning of the Information Age , and they remained the mainstay for water worlds like Pinopa . " Now I 'm really confused , " Julian moaned . " All right . Tying something down is ' making fast . ' A rope attached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rope tied to the mast is a ' stay . ' And a bail is the iron thingamajig on the mast . " " T'e boom , " Poertena corrected , wiping away a drop of sweat . The day , as always , was like a steambath , even with the light wind that filled the sails . " T'e bail is on t'e boom . Unless you 're taking on water . T'en you bail it out . " " I give up ! " " Don ' worry about it , " the Pinopan said with a chuckle . " You only been at t'is a few weeks . Besides , you got me an ' all t'ose four-armed monstrosities to do t'e sailing . You jus ' pull when we say ' heave , ' and stop when we say ' avast . ' " " And hold on when you say ' belay . ' " " And hold on tight when we say belay . " " I blame Roger for this , " Julian said with another shake of his head . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked from behind him . Julian looked over his shoulder and grinned at Nimashet Despreaux . The female sergeant was frowning at him , but it slid off the irrepressible NCO like water off a duck . " It 's all Roger 's fault that we 're in this predicament , " he replied . " If it was n't for him , I would n't have to learn this junk ! " Despreaux opened her mouth , but Julian held up a hand before she could retort . " Calmly , Nimashet . I know it 's not Roger 's fault . It was a joke , okay ? " Despreaux 's frown only underscored the classical beauty of her face , but it was dark with worry . " Roger 's ... still not taking Kostas ' death very well , Adib . I just do n't ... I do n't want anybody even joking about this being his fault , " she said , and Poertena nodded in agreement . " T'e prince did n't maroon us here , Julian . T'e Saints an ' whoever set t'at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armorer shrugged . " I guess it was n't very pocking punny . " " Okay , " a chagrined Julian said . " You 've got a point . Roger has been sort of dragging around , has n't he ? " " He 's been in a funk , is what you mean , " Despreaux said . " Well , I 'm sure there 's some way you could cheer him up , " Julian suggested with an evil grin . " Oh , pock , " Poertena muttered , and backed up quickly . After a crack like that the fecal matter was about to hit the impeller . " Now this is a mutinous crew , if ever I 've seen one . " Sergeant Major Eva Kosutic said , joining them . She looked from Despreaux 's furious face to Julian 's " **32;954;TOOLONG " expression and frowned . " All right , Julian . What did you say this time ? " " Me ? " Julian asked with enormous innocence but little real hope of evading the consequences . The sergeant major had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up just as the action was hottest . Which come to think of it , described her in bed as well . " What would I have said ? " Now he looked from the sergeant major to the fulminating Despreaux , decided that coming clean offered his best chance of survival , and shrugged with a repentant expression . " I just suggested that there might be a way to cheer Roger up , " he admitted , then , unable to help himself , grinned again . " I guarantee I 'm right . God knows I 've been more cheerful lately . " The sergeant major rolled her eyes and crossed her arms . " Well if that 's your attitude , you 'll damned well be less cheerful for a while ! " She looked at the three noncoms and shook her head . " This is a clear case of His Evilness ' finding work for idle hands . Poertena , I thought you were supposed to be conducting a class in rigging . " " I was trying to get Julian up to speed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length of rope to the deck . " T'at 's not going too good . " " I 've got all the stuff loaded in my toot , " Julian said with a shrug . " But some of the data seems to be wrong , and the rest just seems to be hitting and bouncing . I mean , what 's ' luff ' mean ? " " It 's when the sail flaps , " Kosutic replied , shaking her head . " Even I know that , and I hate sailing . I guess we should 've known better than to try to teach Marines to be sailors . " " We do n't really need them , Sergeant Major , " Poertena told her . " We 've got plenty of Mardukans . " " We need to work on our entry techniques , anyway , " Julian pointed out . " We 've been engaging in all these open-field maneuvers , but when we take the spaceport , it 's going to be mostly close quarters . Whole different style , Smaj . And we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sergeant major frowned , then nodded . She was sure Julian had come up with that because it was more fun than learning to sail . But that did n't mean he was wrong . " Okay . Concur . If we wanted sailors , we should 've left you on the DeGlopper and brought Navy pukes . I 'll talk the change over with the Old Man . If he approves , we 'll start working on close combat techniques for the rest of the voyage . " " Besides , " Poertena pointed out gloomily , " we might need them before t'en . I 've never seen a place like t'is t'at did n't have pirates . " " And then there 's the ' fish of unusual size . ' " Julian chuckled and gestured out over the emerald waters . " So far , so good , right ? " " Do n't laugh , " Despreaux muttered . " I read that log . I do not want to tangle with something big enough to bite a boat in half , even a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a tug on her earlobe . " If worse comes to worst , we can always give Roger a pocket knife and throw him at it . " " Ooooo ! " Julian shook his head . " You have n't even met one of these little fishies and you hate them that much ? " * * * Prince Roger Ramius Sergei Alexander Chiang MacClintock , Heir Tertiary to the Throne of Man , turned away from the creaming waves to look across the shipboard bustle . The sergeant major had just broken up the huddle around Julian , and the four NCOs were headed in four different directions . He took a moment extra to watch Despreaux make for the fo'c'sle . He knew his depression was beginning to affect her , and that he needed to snap out of it . But the loss of Kostas was the one wound that would not seem to heal , and he 'd had too much time to think about it since the frenetic haste of getting all seven ships built had eased into the voyage itself . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged in frantic efforts to train native troops , fight barbarian armies , build ships , or simply hike through endless jungle . For that matter , nothing was actively attempting to kill him , devour him , assassinate him , or kidnap him , and a part of him was distantly amazed to discover just how much having that respite depressed him . Having time to think , he had learned , was not always a good thing . He supposed he could pull up the list of casualties on his implanted toot . But there would n't be much point . When they 'd first landed , the Marines of Bravo Company , Bronze Battalion of the Empress Own Regiment , had been just so many faces . And the officers and crew of the Assault Ship DeGlopper , long since expanding plasma , had just been blurs . But since some time after the pilots of the shuttles had brought them to deadstick landings on this backward hell , some time between the internecine fighting that had erupted at the first city they 'd visited and the furious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than faces . In many ways , they had become more than family-as close as a part of his own body . And each loss had been like flaying skin . First the loss of half the company in Voitan , fighting the Kranolta . Then the constant low-level seepage as they battled their way across the rest of the continent . More good troops killed in Diaspra against the Boman , and then a handful more in Sindi against the main Boman force . The ones who fell to the damnbeasts and the vampire moths . And the crocs .
