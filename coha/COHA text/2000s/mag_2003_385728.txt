FOREIGN POLICY The embargo must go <p> The subject of Cuba and U.S. policy toward that troubled and ill-governed island has surfaced again in the highest quarters of our land . The island was discovered by Columbus on October 27 , 1492 . Four hundred and ten years later it became a republic . On May 20 , 1902 , one Toms Estrada Palma assumed the presidency of the fledgling nation . He was hand-picked by Maj. Gen. Leonard Wood , serving the administration of President McKinley . Cuba 's race and class divisions reflected four centuries of Spanish colonial rule and an economic dependence on slavery , up until the 1870s . In the 19th century , disparate elements of Cuban society  --  planters , peasants , and slaves  --  coalesced to oppose Spanish rule . In a succession of bloody conflicts and cruel reprisals , the toll in lives was staggering . <p> The word filibuster , deriving from the Dutch for freebooter or buccaneer , was early on applied to American adventurers who sought to take a hand in wresting Cuba from Spain . Presidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to discourage these incursions as a violation of U.S. and international law . In 1850 , Gov . John Quitman of Mississippi , having conspired to support an expeditionary force under the command of Cuban rebel leader Narciso Lpez , was indicted under federal law . Nothing daunted , Seor Lpez organized another expedition . The good ship Pampero , on August 3 , 1851 , steamed from New Orleans with 400 unlucky lads , including Cuban and Hungarian exiles and some 200 young American adventurers . <p> A week later with high hopes they landed at Playtas , 140 miles from Havana . The anticipated Cuban uprising against the Spanish did not occur . The invasion party marched six miles and encountered Spanish forces that defeated them handily . The fifty who had fled back to their ship were intercepted by Spanish gunboats , returned to shore , summarily tried , and shot . Lpez was captured and publicly garroted . One hundred and sixty young Americans were sent to prison in Spain . Embarrassing negotiations led to their ransom and return , a painful precursor to our buy-back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But homegrown rebellion on the island did eventually take hold , gaining traction in the ten-year war that began in 1868 , and in Jos Mart 's War of Independence of 1895 . Came then the explosion of the battleship Maine on February 15 , 1898 , U.S. intervention , victory , occupation , and the subsequent efforts of two McKinley-appointed governors to establish an infrastructure and seed the rudiments of democracy . A NEW CUBA <p> The delegates to the first Cuban constitutional convention in 1900 were educated men who knew well enough the difference between independence and the regime they were being asked to accept as a condition of raising their own flag . The ringer was the so-called Platt Amendment to the Cuban Constitution , passed not by their Congress , but by ours . Fashioned by our secretary of war , Elihu Root , and placed before the U.S. Congress by Sen. Orville Platt of Connecticut , it entitled the U.S. to intervene decisively in Cuba 's internal and external affairs whenever such intervention was deemed necessary : to enhance stability on the island , oversee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bases , and guard against anything 's being done in Cuba that would imperil U.S. interests . <p> The Platt Amendment was abrogated in 1934 under FDR . It is unremembered in the United States , but well remembered in Cuba . The pejorative Platista as a term of disparagement has entered their lexicon . The memory of it is a factor in U.S.-Cuban relations . At the time of Cuban independence , Secretary of State John Hay observed that " dealing with Cuba is like trying to conduct a polite conversation with a squirrel on your lap . " Sixty years after Cuban independence , I served as administrative assistant to Attorney General Robert Kennedy during the Cuban Missile Crisis ; I would have upgraded the metaphor from squirrel in our lap to bear in our backyard . The sigh of collective relief when Khrushchev blinked and turned his ships back from the quarantine line was heard around the world . <p> More decades have passed since that high-water mark of nuclear threat , generated by the supremely poor joint judgment of Messrs . Castro and Khrushchev . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revive an economy shattered by the collapse of the Soviet Union and the resulting termination of its $10 billion annual Cuban subsidy . The good news is the economic blow was so severe that Castro had to allow creeping capitalism to soften it . Beauty parlors and pet shops could be operated on free-market terms ; also restaurants in private homes , if no more than 12 patrons were present at any one time . If Pablo is No. 13 at the door , he 'll have to wait outside under the kindly surveillance of the police . <p> But the doleful consequences of the Soviet sayonara were obvious to all of us on the six-man , bipartisan delegation of current and former members of Congress . With a grant from the Ford Foundation , the delegation gained the permission of both governments to travel to Cuba in 1996 . In that year , some 60,000 other Americans visited , without U.S. permission . The number is now pushing 200,000 per annum , and one assumes from administration pronouncements that Treasury and Justice will come down harder on such lawbreakers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government officials , congressmen and staff , human-rights activists , and other knowledgeable folks , we also consulted with Cuban officials , including Ricardo Alarcon , the smooth , well-informed president of the National Assembly , Castro 's kept legislature . We met as well with middle-level bureaucrats , farmers , industrial spokesmen , church leaders , students and faculty of Havana University , foreign diplomats , and private citizens  --  including members of the " dissident " community , their names given to us by their Miami-based former countrymen . Dr. Castro himself was preoccupied with a gaggle of Foreign Ministers , which , I am told , was just as well , as he prefers monologue to dialogue . In any event , though we had diverse viewpoints going into Cuba , these merged on return in a unanimous report to Congress , with observations and conclusions seconded by two subsequent congressional visits . They all called for unrestricted travel and an end to the embargo . My own observations : <p> Cuba 's physical plant and infrastructure are in a shambles . The termination of the annual Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 13 million to 8 million barrels a year is reflected in the wretched state of public services and utilities . Wheezing , overcrowded buses inch along past endless lines of patient commuters . Bicycles built for one but carrying two compete for space on the potholed streets with a generation of dented and fuming vehicles that went into honorable retirement everywhere else in the world forty years ago . As European and Canadian tourism grows , the grand facades of old Havana , crumbling from neglect , are only just now beginning to receive the attentions of local and foreign architects and builders . <p> In sum , if the intent of the past two generations of U.S. policy towards Cuba has been to render its economy comatose  --  energy consumption cut in half , vehicular travel horse- and mule-drawn or fixed in time to the 1950s , agricultural production inadequate , diet restricted , plumbing and street lamps non-operational , professional classes earning less than busboys in the gleaming Veradero tourist hotels , and too many of her fairest daughters walkers of the night streets  --  I would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , the intent for the past four decades has been to alter Cuba 's form of government or to remove its leader , well , we know the answer to that . Someone once defined insanity as the constant repetition of the same act in expectation of a different result . Granted , the same can be said of Dr. Castro . Feeling the hot breath of incipient entrepreneurship , he now requests his people to engrave socialism in their Constitution . His request is their command . Well balanced , these twin insanities are lighting our way , so to speak , into the 21st century . <p> Bear in mind that the original rationale for the embargo and ancillary policies , in l960 , was to protest Cuba 's expropriation of American properties and her progressive satellization by the Soviet Union . The latter ended , along with the Soviet subsidy , 13 years ago , at which point the dagger at our throat became an orphan at our doorstep . A further concern , that Cuba was exporting revolution , has also faded into a history replete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted failure of doctrinaire socialism as a viable road to prosperity in Cuba itself . <p> Embargoing a socialist country per se does not commend itself as national policy . Certainly not to the pope , or the prominent lay Baptist , Jimmy Carter . The list of skeptics of our present policy includes governors , U.S. senators , state legislators , and the entire agricultural community except producers of sugar , rum , and cigars . Meanwhile , disinterested observers  --  and that would include most Americans  --  can be forgiven for wondering what exactly are the immunizing charms of Red China , North Korea , and North Vietnam , whose forces have killed or maimed hundreds of thousands of young Americans , which remain ruthless Communist dictatorships , yet are considered more deserving of U.S. outreach and qualified for U. S. trade , than this impoverished island under the cruel governance of one who can threaten his own people but no longer ours . Why this distinction ? <p> The voice of the embargo is the voice of the United States . But the hand is that of Little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nay , insisting , that one megalomaniacal , septuagenarian ideologue and his cadre of automatons keep us apart . What about Castro himself ? There is never any excuse for a slavemaster , but it repays the time given to reflect on his predecessors . I went to the encyclopedia for an objective description of the regimes that governed the pre-Castro Cuban Republic . One could list the names of the some dozen caudillos who exercised power before the Batista coup of 1952 . Suffice to say that despite the high-sounding and unimplemented Constitution of 1940 , no Cuban leader 's name is revered in Miami . If the name of Jos Mart is evoked , recall that he was the leader of Cuba 's 1895 revolution , and was killed that same year in a gun battle with Spanish forces , depriving Cuba of a truly democratic progenitor . <p> Respecting Cuba 's regime immediately pre-Castro , the encyclopedia has this to say : " Cuban politics before 1959 consisted of graft , corruption , maladministration , fiscal irresponsibility , and social insensitivity especially toward Afro-Cubans . Foreign read U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land , 90% of the essential services , and 40% of the sugar production . Income from sugar was augmented by a vigorous tourist business based on hotels , casinos , and brothels . Havana became especially attractive during the years of U.S. Prohibition as a source of liquors and pleasure . Yet the prosperity of the 20s , 30s , 40s , and 50s enriched only a few Cubans , mainly politicians and their families . The average rural worker earned $91 a year . " <p> That was the apple cart the Jesuit-schooled Fidel set out to upset . Latin American Communist movements were alive and assertive when Fidel , who initially disdained Communism and criticized its restrictions on human rights , came of age as a ranking law-school graduate , well-read in the classics and a renowned baseball and basketball player . But the lure of the Left could be detected , and the siren song of socialism was evident in a letter he wrote , I believe from jail , at age 25 : " With what joy would I bring revolution to this country from top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the hate and ill will of one or two thousand people , among them some relations , half my friends , two-thirds of my colleagues , and four-fifths of my old comrades at university . Have you noticed the number of invisible links which a man who is anxious to live in accord with his ideas must break ? What makes me suffer most , is to think that if all the generous men there are on earth were to respond to our appeal , all the charlatans , parasites , mediocrities , and egoists of every kidney would vanish at once . " <p> Fidel 's deliberate alienation not only of friends but of family , in pursuit of his rapidly reddening star , was reciprocal . Most fled to the United States , including some of the finest families , plus the cream of the business , professional , and academic communities . Some of the homebound dissidents ruefully commented on the relative ease of opposing Castroism  --  from Florida . WILL THE MAJORITY RULE ? <p> Cuban charm , expressed especially in music and dance , continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultural sensibility . There is a mild uneasiness with our official policy of blanket rejection . I say mild because the Cuban question is not of the first importance in any but one or two of the fifty states of the Union . Yet the policy of enforced isolation is insisted upon by the first wave of Cuban migrs to this country  --  men and women gifted , resourceful , and well organized , who left all behind and understandably would like to recruit Uncle Sam to get it all back , either as restored citizens of a new Cuba or as newly minted Americans merely following the old example of their countrymen . <p> It is arguable that majorities in America rule only when they care to . Until then , some foreign policies derive from the focused efforts of well-educated , well-financed , and firmly dedicated minorities . During my race for the Senate from Missouri 26 years ago , I gave a light-hearted talk entitled " Toward an American Foreign Policy "  --  as distinct from a hyphenated American foreign policy . It was embellished with a reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign managers correctly pronounced this the stupidest of my several mistakes . I was certainly taken to task by every spokesman for the revealed truths of each of our politically active minorities . <p> Nevertheless , there is in the case of Cuba one inconsistency on the part of the pro-embargo community that would seem glaring enough to give hypocrisy a bad name . We insist that Uncle Sam do nothing to replenish the coffers of the Castro government . Yet , if 60 Minutes correctly calculated , nearly $1 billion dollars per year are sent to Cubans by expatriate friends and families . The dollars are spent in dollar stores owned and operated by ? The Cuban government . By the way , anxious as we are for Cuba to make restitution for nationalized properties , is it sensible to hobble post-Castro Cuba 's ability to do so ? Then again , our international lawyers may be tasked to prepare a response to Cuba 's likely suggestion that the costs to her of the 40-year embargo should offset , perhaps exceed , the costs of expropriation . This , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day in the morning : normalization of relations . <p> How do we get there , and what do we do for the rest of the night ? That is the core question we put to the human-rights activists within Cuba we were explicitly told to consult by their anxious brethren in the migr community . First , we asked what they thought of Helms-Burton . Most Americans would probably identify Helms-Burton in a multiple-choice questionnaire as a vintage British automobile . But as the restrictive U.S. law , it has been big news in Cuba and the regular object of well-orchestrated island-wide demonstrations and protests . It is the law that tightens the embargo and punishes not only Americans but other folks who test it . We call it , said one whimsical dissident , " The Helms-Burton-Castro Act . " Why ? Because it gives El Supremo one more reason to blame the U.S. for an economy sagging of its own miserable socialist weight . Again , we asked , what to do ? Simple , they said . Dispatch a fleet of cruise ships to Cuban coasts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dump Americans on this island from one end to the other , and the spirit of change will take wing . <p> Mind you , we were not talking to the Cuban Chamber of Commerce , or any other official spokesmen for that tight little island , but to the dissidents  --  who were clearly saying : The more America , the better . Curious to hear , at this end : the less America , the better . Curious , too , that the latter voices dominate the former . <p> Now , before I 'm taken away for questioning , I wistfully recall the sage words of President Ronald Reagan in his 1984 address to the Kennan Institute on U.S.-Soviet Exchanges : " The way governments can best promote contacts among people is by not standing in the way . " The fall of the Soviet Union was still five years off , so he was talking about contacts with the Evil Empire , the main repository of real and present danger . In the darkest days of the Cold War it was President Eisenhower who inaugurated the famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of a defanged Cuba less deserving of such consideration ? For balance let us now listen to President Clinton , in his second State of the Union address : " We must pursue a deeper dialogue with China for the the sake of our interests and our ideals . An isolated China is not good for America .... Engaging China is the best way to work on our common challenges ... and to deal frankly with our fundamental differences like human rights . " China s , Cuba no ? <p> May I conclude by suggesting to anyone who for any reason is a staunch supporter of the embargo and our policy of isolation and wishes to remain comfortable with that view , do not visit Cuba . But to anyone willing to expose such bias to the hazards of inquiry , by all means go if legally permitted . Vaya con Dios , and enjoy the company of a bright , lively , gracious , artistic , fun-loving , and amazingly cheerful and friendly crowd , the Cuban people . <p> By James W. Symington <p> <p> Mrs. Symington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of protocol , was a member of the bipartisan delegation that visited Cuba in 1996 . <p>
