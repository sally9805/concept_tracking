Already dreaded by high schoolers , the SAT won no new fans when it emerged in early March that 4,600 tests were scored incorrectly . A week later , an additional 1,600 tests were found to need rechecking . A guide to the debacle : <P> Who 's to blame ? The rain , apparently . The morning of the October 2005 testing was so wet that the answer sheets expanded , which meant they misaligned with the scoring scanners . Because the whole process is mechanized , nobody noticed until late December , when two students asked to have their tests rescored by hand ( for a fee ) , which took about a month . Those misscored tests led to the rechecking of the entire year 's tests  --  which was not finished until early March . <P> How serious is the problem ? Tiny . The 4,600 affected tests were 0.8% of the 495,000 taken that day . Only 16 tests were underscored 200 points or more ; 95% of the scores were 10 to 90 points too low . Those will be fixed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be adjusted . " The SAT has been around since 1926 , " notes the College Board 's Chiara Coletti . " In that time there has n't ever been an error of this kind . " <P> And the 1,600 other tests ? Every time the SAT is given , some score sheets need a second look  --  to investigate irregularities like possible cheating . That 's why those 1,600 tests were set aside before rechecking began . They resurfaced last week . Those results will be ready this week . <P> Are the problems fixed ? The contractor that scores the tests is working on technical solutions . Critics carp that the system still has no real safeguards , but the College Board says hand scoring is an adequate control . It is requested by someone from nearly every sitting , giving ample opportunity to catch glitches.
