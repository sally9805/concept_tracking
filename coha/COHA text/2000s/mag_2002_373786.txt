JIMMY CARTER Peace <P> Almost everyone agrees that Jimmy Carter was not our best President , but as former Presidents go , he 's tops . This was confirmed when the Nobel Committee recognized him for his " untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts , to advance democracy and human rights , and to promote economic and social development . " The committee acknowledged the role he played while President in the 1978 Camp David accords , when he forged a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel , and for the work he has done since leaving office in 1981 . In 1982 Carter and his wife Rosalynn founded the Carter Center , which promotes human rights , democracy and health care . He has traveled the world from East Timor to Haiti mediating conflicts and monitoring elections , and promoted Habitat for Humanity , an organization that builds housing for low-income families . Though Carter , a Democrat , received a congratulatory call from President George W. Bush , the honor was not devoid of politics . In its statement the committee noted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of power , Carter has stood by the principles that conflicts must as far as possible be resolved through mediation and international cooperation based on international law . " Committee chairman Gunnar Berge said the choice of Carter , who opposes unilateral U.S. action against Iraq , should be interpreted as criticism of the Bush Administration 's hard-line policy on Iraq . <P> IMRE KERTESZ Literature <P> It is hardly surprising that Hungarian novelist Imre Kertesz , 72 , is not well known in the U.S. : only two of his books have been translated into English . But he is also somewhat of a stranger in his native country . His low profile may be in part because of the dense themes in his writing . Sent to Auschwitz at age 14 in 1944 , Kertesz was transferred to , and subsequently liberated from , Buchenwald in 1945 . He returned to Hungary only to endure communist rule for four decades . In his novels and essays he revisits the Holocaust , pondering , in the words of the Nobel Committee , " the fragile experience of the individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grimly accepting of these ghastly events . His 1975 novel , Fateless , concerns a young boy shipped to Auschwitz who survives by conforming in thought and behavior . Within hours of the Nobel Prize announcement , his books sold out at Hungarian bookstores . <P> DANIEL KAHNEMAN Economics <P> In the field of economics , theoretical models are predicated on people behaving rationally . Daniel Kahneman proved otherwise , perhaps because he is not an economist . A professor at Princeton University , Kahneman , 65 , is a cognitive psychologist . In his studies he has shown that people are not particularly wise about assessing probability . His work , he has said , was inspired by such curiosities as finding that when polled , subjects said they would travel 20 minutes to save $5 on a $15 calculator but not spend the same time to save $5 on a $125 jacket . Kahneman won the prize , according to the committee , for " having integrated insights from psychological research into economic science . " Upon learning that he had won , Kahneman locked himself out of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't always go hand in hand .
