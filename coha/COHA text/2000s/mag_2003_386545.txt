Section : A CENTURY OF FLIGHT The Enterprise . The Blackbird . The Enola Gay . A vast new Smithsonian facility outside Washington , D.C. opens December 15 , with scores of restored aircraft and spacecraft , many on display for the first time <p> LARS McLAMORE and Samantha Gallagher are standing on the wings of a Focke Wulf 190 , a German World War II fighter . They peer under the forward engine cowlings , searching for a place to attach straps so a crane can hoist the airplane onto a flatbed trailer . It 's about 9 a.m. outside a Maryland storage facility operated by the Smithsonian 's National Air and Space Museum ( NASM ) . The Focke Wulf , a rare F model built in 1943 , is a veteran of both the Eastern and Western Fronts and the only fighter aircraft of that vintage with electrically operated landing gear and flaps . It has been in storage for years , and McLamore and Gallagher have to get it to the museum 's new facility near Dulles International Airport , 40 miles away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until its front wheels clear the ground . But the tail does n't rise , and this piece of aviation history needs to be level , lest it be damaged when placed on the flatbed . The crane lowers it to the ground . " Everything about this move is trial and error , " says McLamore , an aircraft maintenance specialist . <p> It 's no ordinary move . Fifteen years in the planning , the new Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center  --  scheduled to open December 15 and keyed to the 100th anniversary of the Wright brothers ' historic flight  --  will ultimately contain more than 200 aircraft in its 245,000-square-foot aviation hall , which is more than 980 feet long , nearly 250 feet wide and , at its apex , 103 feet tall . Also making their December debut will be an Imax theater , an observation tower from which visitors can observe airplanes coming and going at Dulles , and a 47,000-square-foot aerospace hail ( which then will close to the public to undergo finishing touches ) . The entire five-building Dulles-area facility , about as large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ohio , will contain more than 17 acres of floor space . <p> On the workers ' fourth attempt , the Focke Wulf rises perfectly level about seven feet in the air . Gallagher clambers into the semi 's cab and eases the flatbed under the aircraft , and half a dozen workers strap it down . The plane does not face straight ahead ; rather , its nose is angled some 45 degrees off center , to reduce the overhang . Otherwise , the 34.5-foot wingspan would be too wide for highway loads , which are restricted to 30 feet . A few days later , after the workers have repeatedly checked their cargo , this strange convoy of flatbed and five escorts ( including a police cruiser ) crawls out of the parking lot a little before midnight , when traffic is minimal . Barely going 15 miles an hour , the vehicles wend their way onto the Washington Beltway . <p> SMITHSONIAN OFFICIALS had longed for another aviation facility for decades . The National Air and Space Museum , which opened on the Washington , D.C. Mall in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only about 10 percent of the museum 's collection . ( The bulk of the holdings have been in storage or on loan to other museums . ) In 1988 , the St. Louis-based architectural firm Hellmuth , Obata + Kassabaum , designers of the modernist NASM building on the Mall , won a NASM-sponsored competition to design the supplemental facility . Congress then authorized $8 million to complete the plan , which centered around a curved-roof aviation hall inspired by a Zeppelin hangar . <p> Congress authorized no money to build the facility , so the Smithsonian launched a campaign to raise more than $300 million . Steven Udvar-Hazy , a Hungarian immigrant and pilot who made a fortune in the aircraft-leasing business , made a $60 million donation , at the time the largest single gift in the Institution 's history . He has said his donation was motivated largely by a desire " to give back to America part of the rewards " that aviation had given him ( see page 20 ) . <p> But the slumping economy since 2000 has slowed private donations , and museum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new facility . Because the shortfall has delayed construction of the restoration and preservation shop , only 82 of the planned 200 aircraft will be on display come opening day . <p> In the early days of the center 's construction , Tom Alison , chief of NASM 's collections division , often sat down with William Jacobs , the senior exhibits designer , to arrange paper cutouts of the aircraft on a printout of the floor design . But a close look at some of the actual artifacts , like " Flak Bait , " the nickname of a Martin B-26 Marauder , prompted them to change their plans . Built in 1943 , this twin-engine warbird survived an extraordinary amount of antiaircraft fire while logging 207 combat missions in European skies  --  more than any other American aircraft during World War II . But it turned out the plane could n't be fully restored in time to make the museum 's opening . <p> Similarly , curators had wanted to hang a 1918 Spad XVI and a 1930 Curtiss Gulfhawk from trusses in the hall , but neither plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truss weighs 120 tons and is anchored to a pair of 170-ton concrete blocks 30 feet deep in the ground . ) American aviation legend Billy Mitchell had flown the Spad biplane in World War I , earning himself the Distinguished Service Cross for " repeated acts of extraordinary heroism in action . " The Gulfhawk was flown regularly by the renowned stunt pilot Al Williams . But both aircraft suffer from deterioration of the wing spars , where cables would be attached , so they 'll stay on the floor . And sometimes a piece has unexpectedly shown up . After the Air France Concorde was retired from service this past May , the company donated one of the supersonic jets to the museum years ahead of schedule , forcing another round of musical aircraft . <p> Probably the best known  --  and most controversial  --  artifact on display is the Enola Gay , the B-29 Superfortress that dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima on August 6 , 1945 . Dismantled in 1960 , it has been in storage ever since . Before its forward fuselage went on display at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veterans , faulted the proposed display text , which described the damage caused by atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki . They charged that the text overemphasized casualties and underplayed the fives that the bombings presumably saved by abruptly ending the war ; the exhibit subsequently added information about deaths prevented and focused on the aircraft 's technical advances . Since then , Smithsonian experts have carefully restored the entire plane . The new Enola Gay exhibit acknowledges the plane 's role in the bombing and presents details such as the B-29 's having been the first pressurized bomber , but does not mention atomic bomb casualties . <p> The new exhibit has prompted protests . In Japan , an atomic-bomb survivor group said this past August that displaying the aircraft is insensitive to victims of the atomic bombing . In the United States , an eclectic coalition of nuclear weapons opponents charged in a petition last month that omitting casualties of the atomic bombings and the larger debate over use of the bombs would make the weapons more likely to be used in the future . The petition signees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctorow . NASM 's director , Gen. John R. ( Jack ) Dailey , a former Marine Corps pilot , said , " We 're going to present the aircraft primarily in terms of its technical capabilities , and leave the interpretation as to how it was used to the visitor . " <p> Among the other craft to go on display this month is the space shuttle Enterprise . Though it never reached outer space , the shuttle served as a test vehicle for atmospheric flights and landings . There 's a Lockheed SR-7I Blackbird , the Air Force spy plane ; though nearly 40 years old , it still holds the record as the fastest , highest-flying operational jet ever built . ( In 1990 , it streaked more than 2,000 miles per hour across the continental United States in 1 hour 7 minutes , not including takeoff and landing . ) Also on view will be the Cessna 180 Spirit of Columbus , in which Geraldine Mock made history in 1964 as the first female pilot to fly around the world . <p> Inside the Udvar-Hazy Center , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemingly endless expanse . A catwalk , or " skyway , " suspended from the ceiling appears to float in midair . The airplanes hanging high up in the rafters do n't make much of an impression from the floor , but when you 're up on the skyway , they look as though they 're zooming past you within arm 's reach . Suspended close to the ground is a Chance Vaught F4U Corsair . With its gear down and its left wing dipping for a steep bank , it seems to swoop with intent . " It 's set up for a carrier landing , " says Dailey , who joined the Marines in 1956 to fly Corsairs , as his father had done in World War II and Korea . " The long nose of the aircraft meant you essentially had to be in a turn all the way to touchdown so that you could see the landing signal officer between the nose and the wing . " <p> IT 'S ALMOST 2 A.M. when the Focke Wulf convoy turns into the Udvar-Hazy Center entrance . Now an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the road stands in the way of the airplane 's left wingtip . Two men jump out of a van , seize the sign and yank it out of the ground . The convoy rolls on . ( They would replace the sign later . ) By 2:30 , a crane lifts the 60-year-old warbird from the flatbed and carries it to the center of the hall , where it joins other World War II veterans . Like the other artifacts on display , the Focke Wulf has two stories to tell  --  its place in history and how the heck it got here . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Opening the vast Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center near Dulles Airport in Northern Virginia required 15 years of planning and a good deal of delicate , heavy lifting ( the midnight move of a rare , 7,000 pound German World War II fighter , the Focke Wulf 190 , from a Maryland storage facility to the Northern Virginia center ) . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : The new facility will eventually hold some 335 artifacts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex includes the aviation hall ( welcoming the world 's fastest jet , the SR-71 Blackbird , in September ) and a tower affording views of Dulles International Airport . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : About 40 percent of the planes to be displayed will be military aircraft .
