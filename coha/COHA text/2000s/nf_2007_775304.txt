COURTING VENOM // Being Clarence Thomas // Dallas attorney Eric Moye received his copy in the mail from a fellow Harvard Law School alum . He started reading it but stopped to make a copy of the copy for a friend . He continued reading , absorbed , enchanted , depressed , exhilarated . Couldn ? t put it down  --  except to make more copies . // It wasn ? t a John Grisham thriller , but it might as well have been . " An Open Letter to Justice Clarence Thomas from a Federal Judicial Colleague " created an enormous buzz when the University of Pennsylvania Law Review published it in January 1992 . Written by A. Leon Higginbotham Jr. , chief judge emeritus of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit , it was part history lesson and part admonition . Crafted with scholarly precision , it contained eighty-five footnotes and numerous citations of important court cases . But the essence of it read like a stern grandfather lecturing his bullheaded grandson : Don ? t forget the roots of your success , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paved your way . // " You ? must try to remember that the fundamental problems of the disadvantaged , women , minorities , and the powerless have not all been solved simply because you have ? moved on up ? from Pin Point , Georgia , to the Supreme Court , " Higginbotham wrote in the conclusion of his twenty-four-page set of instructions to Thomas . Reciting a roster of notable names from the past , Higginbotham urged Thomas to see his life as connected to " the visions and struggles of Frederick Douglass , Sojourner Truth , Harriet Tubman , Charles Hamilton Houston , A. Philip Randolph , Mary McLeod Bethune , W. E. B. Du Bois , Roy Wilkins , Whitney Young , Martin Luther King , Judge William Henry Hastie , Justices Thurgood Marshall , Earl Warren , and William Brennan , as well as the thousands of others who dedicated much of their lives to create the America that made your opportunities possible . " // The " open letter " read at times like a personal letter and was dated November 29 , 1991 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high court . Higginbotham felt ambivalent about making his letter public but did so , he said , to help this generation and future ones better evaluate Thomas . Because it was so well sourced and because it was penned by a black twenty-seven-year veteran of the federal bench , the letter as law review article carried an authority that most Thomas critiques did not . // As such , it received considerable attention . The University of Pennsylvania received more than seventeen thousand requests for reprints , and law offices around the country busily churned out photocopies . // " Sometimes chain letters circulate all over the place , " recalled Moye , " and this was kind of like one of those . " Nowhere was the interest greater than in black legal circles , where a robust debate was unfolding about what kind of justice Thomas would become . Moye , a former state district judge with a weakness for Cuban cigars and the finest steaks , acted as if he ? d reached nirvana . After he made his first copy of the Higginbotham treatise and got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bound version to put on his office shelf . So many photocopies were in circulation that another one even came back to Moye  --  just like a chain letter . // " It was spreading like fire across the dry prairie , " Moye recalled . " Folks were calling one another speculating on whether Thomas would ever respond to Judge Higginbotham 's open letter . " // The showdown marked the beginning of a transition in the way African Americans came to view Thomas , a shift that helped harden his image nationally . Gradually but inexorably , wariness supplanted wait-and-see as the predominant state of mind among blacks . Wariness became distrust , which blossomed into contempt . // " I 'll put it like this , " said basketball legend Kareem Abdul Jabbar . " If he let people know that he was going to be at some public destination , let ? s say in Harlem , at a certain hour on a certain day , let ? s see how many supporters would show up and how many detractors would show up . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had discovered Higginbotham ? s law article and wondered : How can someone who benefited so richly from affirmative action not support the same remedy for those in similar circumstances ? // Though his confirmation hearings left Thomas wounded and enraged , the good news should have been that initially , at least , more than twice as many African Americans , according to polls , believed him as believed Anita Hill . But Thomas couldn ? t find the resolve to embrace that reassuring fact . He was shell-shocked by his ordeal and retreated into his work , which was difficult enough , and he was already behind . The court ? s term began in October 1991 . Because of his drawn-out confirmation process and the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist ? s wife , Nan , Thomas wasn ? t sworn in until the first day of November . He arrived with no staff , his law clerks weren ? t up to speed , and he was hamstrung by his inexperience as a judge  --  he ? d spent just nineteen months on the D.C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was bone tired . // Higginbotham was certainly no help . He became a more formidable nemesis , shedding the reproving grandpa role for the part of public castigator . In an attention-getting 1994 lecture at the Hastings College of Law in San Francisco , Higginbotham used his hour-long remarks to issue a stiff condemnation of Thomas ? s jurisprudence . In one pointed comparison , he said he had studied every opinion written by Thomas and every one composed by his predecessor Marshall , and the difference between the two jurists was " the difference between zero and infinity . " // Then he dug the knife in even deeper . // " I have often pondered how it is that Justice Thomas , an African American , could be so insensitive to the plight of the powerless . Why is he no different , or probably worse , than many of the most conservative Supreme Court justices of this century ? I can only think of one Supreme Court justice during this century who was worse than Justice Clarence Thomas : James McReynolds , a white supremacist who referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the packed auditorium couldn ? t help but notice how emotional Higginbotham had become , his voice trembling , tears flowing . Removing his glasses , he wiped his eyes with a handkerchief . During Democratic presidencies , Higginbotham ? s name often surfaced on short lists of potential Supreme Court nominees . But it never rose to the top . ( In 1995 , he would be awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom , the closest thing a president can muster to a consolation prize . ) The hard part was that Higginbotham was sixty-five and now retired , and not only had he been passed over for a position he had long coveted , he saw it snatched by a junior he felt had not earned it . Detractors attributed Higginbotham ? s behavior to some combination of bitterness , jealousy , and a broken heart . But whatever his reasons , the blasts were effective . And the judgment that Thomas was the kind of black man no black person should admire mushroomed. // The catalog of Thomas-targeted insults is fat and brutal , and today the estrangement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems almost irreconcilable . Emerge , a since-departed African American-oriented news magazine owned by the country ? s first black billionaire , Bob Johnson , twice parodied Thomas on its cover  --  once wearing an Aunt Jemima-style headscarf and another time as a lawn jockey . The editions were among the magazine ? s best sellers . Ebony magazine , which annually publishes a list of the nation ? s hundred most influential African Americans , routinely leaves Thomas off its tally . A former Kansas City mayor can make it , but not the nation ? s only black Supreme Court justice ? // Invitations for Thomas to speak are now carefully vetted . He has discovered that saying yes to an offer also could mean signing up for public humiliation : name-calling , pickets , boycotts . The mere announcement of a Thomas visit is apt to trigger a controversy . In the most famous such episode , the superintendent of the Prince George ? s County , Maryland , school system disinvited Thomas from speaking at a middle school in 1996 after several black school board members complained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' chief , and the show went on  --  demonstrations and all . ( Later , a law clerk gave Thomas a placard that he proudly displayed in his chambers as a kind of combat medal . It read : " Banned in P.G . County . " ) // Thomas has become more intimate with his opposition than he ever thought would be possible in the relatively isolated life of a Supreme Court justice . No venue is sacred . The Reverend Al Sharpton took his beef straight to Thomas ? s home . He led four hundred demonstrators , who stepped off chartered buses , to a public road outside the justice 's secluded suburban Virginia subdivision . There they denounced Thomas as a traitor . Nearly a decade later , Sharpton would campaign for president and continue his bashing of Thomas in a nationally televised debate , claiming , " He is my color , but he ? s not my kind . " Even in academia , where philosophical debate is encouraged , five black University of North Carolina law professors boycotted a visit by Thomas in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theme in all these demonstrations  --  not ideology , not politics , but the seething sense that one of the potential bright lights of the race has rejected his chance to shine . Otherwise , the black North Carolina professors would have howled about the appearances of Justice Antonin Scalia and Justice Sandra Day O ? Connor in preceding years . But they didn ? t . As the professors wrote , explaining their position , in a nation " in which African Americans are disproportionately poor , undereducated , imprisoned and politically compromised , identity  --  racial identity  --  very clearly matters . Were that not the case , Justice Thomas , for all his claims to the contrary , could not have declared himself the victim of a ? high-tech lynching ? during the heated opposition to his appointment to the Supreme Court . " // A special strain of animus seems reserved for Thomas . When the American Civil Liberties Union of Hawaii proposed inviting Thomas to a debate on affirmative action in 2003 , black board member Eric Ferrer was furious . That would be tantamount to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jews , " he fumed . Thomas didn ? t accept the invitation , but Ferrer ended up resigning from the board over the mere fact that an invitation had been extended . " The appropriate word is venom , " said conservative media critic Brent Bozell , assessing what has happened to Thomas . " I would challenge you to find anyone on the left who has been the target of such a vitriolic character assassination campaign as has Clarence Thomas . I even challenge you to find anyone on the right who has . This man is in his own league . " // A league of his own , but one he has helped create , as far as Eric Moye is concerned . Moye , active in Democratic politics , was up for a federal appeals court judgeship during the Clinton administration . He still remembers some of Thomas ? s harsh critiques of civil rights groups during his years as Ronald Reagan ? s chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission . Thomas once told an interviewer that there was not a single area in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? t think of any "  --  and another time complained that all civil rights leaders do is " bitch , bitch , bitch , moan and moan , whine and whine . " Moye wonders if Thomas ever stops to think when he dons his robe : Where would I be if these civil rights figures had not carried the fight to statehouses and courthouses , had not taken the beatings , gone to jail , refused to wilt under exhausting oppression , and even been willing to die for equality ? ( Actually , Thomas has answered that question . He doesn ? t credit civil rights leaders for his opportunities . " My grandfather  --  that ? s the guy that got me out , " he once told an interviewer . " It wasn ? t all these people who are claiming all this leadership stuff . " ) // As Moye sees it , Thomas has tilted so far away from his heritage that there is no longer any real debate about him . " I think there is a profound sense of despair , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to have high expectations . I think there were those who hoped he was going to blossom and develop . But I don ? t think you know many African Americans , other than those who know him personally , who think he turned out all right . " // Comedians now use him as material . Rappers turn him into lyrics . This , from the song " Build and Destroy , " by KRS-One : // The white man ain ? t the devil I promise // You want to see the devil take a look at Clarence Thomas . // Essayists have taken the Thomas-dissecting cottage industry to new heights . Michael Thelwell , an Afro-American studies scholar , writes : " Perhaps black people ought to give serious thought to retiring Clarence from general use as a name in our communities . " // This is what Moye was talking about  --  Thomas has become an infamous cultural symbol . The Notorious C.T . // In September 1997 , Moye happened to be seated next to Judge Higginbotham at a Harvard Law School dinner at Legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still curious after all these years , Moye leaned over and asked if Higginbotham had ever received a private reply to his letter . No , the judge said , he hadn ? t . It was the last time Moye would see Higginbotham. // Thomas was terribly bothered by Higginbotham ? s criticism , he confided to friends , for it seemed to defy customary judicial decorum and was so unsparing . In 1998 , Higginbotham opposed having Thomas speak to the National Bar Association convention in Memphis , saying it was like inviting George Wallace to dinner after he stood in the schoolhouse door and promised to maintain segregation forever . After the usual controversy over his appearance and much hand-wringing , Thomas did speak to the group . In remarks that veered from self-pitying to combative , he maintained that the " principal problem " he faces could be summed up in one succinct sentence : " I have no right to think the way I do because I ? m black . " When Higginbotham was asked about this comment later in a television interview , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to think whatever he wants to , but he does not have a right to be free of critique . " // Early in his tenure as a justice , Thomas arranged for a modernization of the court gym . He ? s bigger than you ? d expect for someone who is five foot eight and a half . He has a running back ? s legs and a lineman ? s chest , a body that always seems stuffed into his suits . He likes lifting weights . The court ? s gym was freighted with outdated equipment , but Thomas turned the renovation into something defiantly delicious . In public and in private , he loved telling people that he planned to work out vigorously so that he could live a long life , stay on the court for forty or fifty years , and outlast all his critics . The story would sometimes be accompanied by that booming guttural laugh of his , but his intention was clear . He was sending a message to his tormentors : No matter how many shots you take at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It ? s been sixteen years now and , indeed , some of his critics have passed on . A. Leon Higginbotham Jr . died on December 12 , 1998 , from a stroke . He was seventy . // Thomas never responded to his open letter . //
