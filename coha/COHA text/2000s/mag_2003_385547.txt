Section : Furniture Making This handsome mahogany desk is beautiful and useful . <p> Back when letters were made of paper and ink and the word " mail " was complete without an opening " e , " every home had a place to write . And while it may have been little more than a plain table with a drawer for supplies , the more upscale among us had a dedicated piece of furniture - something that showed good taste and served its intended use . Our mahogany secretary is a typical example . When closed , its drop-front lid keeps all your papers neatly out of sight , yet when open , the lid creates an ample writing surface for handling the bills or that belated letter . <p> Although most of the parts are made from standard 13/16-in. lumber , some inside pieces are in. thick and the legs are 2 in. thick . If your dealer ca n't plane the wood to these specifications , try a local cabinet shop . We used mahoganyveneer , flakeboard-core stock for the door and back panels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one board . First , crosscut the board a few inches longer than required and plane one edge straight and square . Use a circular saw and ripping guide to cut blanks slightly wider than specified so you can plane the edges smooth and to exact size . Rip each piece by cutting half the depth from opposite faces to reduce the strain on your saw ( Photo 1 ) . <p> Mark the mortise locations and use a router and edge guide to cut the side- and back-rail mortises ( Photo 2 ) . Use a block clamped across each front leg to guide the horizontal front-rail cuts . Square all the mortises with a sharp chisel . <p> Make a full-size template to transfer the tapering leg shape onto two sides of each leg blank . Then , use a sharp plane to trim the faces to the line . When all legs have been shaped , crosscut them to finished length . Case Panels <p> The wide panels are made by gluing together narrower stock . We used a router table and a straight bit to true the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ router table , set up the fence to take a fine surfacing cut on the board edge . Then offset , through shims or adjustment , the outfeed side of the fence so it 's aligned with the bit and will support the wood after the cut . Some commercial router tables have this feature built in . After adjusting the table for jointing , pass the mating edges of the stock past the cutter to trim them straight ( Photo 3 ) . <p> Use joining plates spaced 6 to 8 in. apart when gluing the panel pieces . After about 30 minutes , scrape excess glue from the surfaces and let the glue dry . Then , saw the panels to size with the appropriate beveled cuts ( Photo 4 ) . Keep the blade on the waste side of the layout line and plane the cut edges smooth . <p> Lay out and cut the joining plate slots at the miter joints between the top and sides , and the joints between the bottom and sides . Then , rout the grooves in the side and top panels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts for the case back and drop-front lid to specified dimensions . At the same time , cut the rail stock for the desk base to finished size . <p> Rout the tenon cheeks on the back-frame stiles , lid rails and base rails with a - in. straight bit and router table ( Photo 5 ) . A scrap board behind the workpiece prevents tearout at the end of the cuts . With the cheeks shaped , use a hacksaw to cut the shoulders at the top and bottom edges of the base rails . <p> Install a 3/8-in. - dia. bit in the router table and cut the grooves along the inside edges of the door and back-panel parts . Readjust the height of the bit to cut the mortises in the ends of the back rails and lid stiles , and square the mortise ends with a sharp chisel . Rout the rabbets around the back and lid panels , and test the fit of the panel edges in the frame grooves . <p> Apply glue to the back mortise-and-tenon joints and assemble the stiles to the bottom rail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then add the top rail . Check for square , and assemble the lid in a similar manner . <p> Saw the beveled edges at the top and bottom of the door . Then , rout the rabbets around three sides of the back panel and along the top and ends of the door . Case Assembly <p> Apply glue to the case miter joints , slots and plates , and join the sides to the top . Clamp the parts in both directions to pull the joints tight ( Photo 7 ) , and check that the assembly is square . <p> Slide the back panel into the grooves ( Photo 8 ) , and join the sides to the case bottom panel . Building The Base <p> Spread glue on the side-rail/leg joints and clamp each side subassembly . Cut the spacer blocks and guide strips to size , and glue them to the side rails as shown in the drawing on page 128 . <p> Cut the parts for the drawer frames to size , and add the joining plate slots . Spread glue on the frame joints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use plate joints to attach the frame divider . Bore and countersink pilot holes in the drawer guide strips , and secure them to the bottom frame with screws ( Photo 9 ) . <p> Lay out and cut the plate slots for joining the back rail to the drawer frames . Also , bore and countersink holes in the top frame for mounting the case . Note that some of the holes in the top frame are elongated to allow the case bottom to expand and contract . Then , bore access holes in the bottom frame . <p> Join the top frame to the bottom frame assembly , and then join the back rail to both drawer frames . When the glue has set , join the drawer-frame/rail assembly to the two leg subassemblies ( Photo 10 ) . <p> Cut the lid supports and facing strips to size and join the parts with plates and glue . Cut the stopblocks from - in. - thick stock and bore the pilot holes for securing them to the supports . Slide each support into its slot and fasten the stopblock . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finish . Place the case on top of the desk base , and fasten the parts temporarily . <p> Lay out the hinge locations on the case bottom and door . Use a sharp chisel to cut the mortises ( Photo 11 ) . Mount the hinges and test the operation of the door . If it binds against the case side , simply sand or trim the side or door rabbet until it works smoothly . Drawer And Storage Insert <p> Cut the drawer parts to size and use a router table to make the joints . Apply glue to the sides , front and back , and then assemble the box and check for square . Slide the bottom panel into place and screw it to the drawer back . <p> Mount the drawer pull to the drawer face , and screw the face to the drawer box . Test the fit of the drawer in its opening and trim where necessary . Then , temporarily mount the lid pulls and the support pulls . <p> Cut the parts for the storage insert and rout the dadoes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and assemble the parts ( Photo 12 ) . Bore and countersink screwholes in the top of the insert , slide it into position and screw it to the case top . Finishing <p> Disassemble the secretary and sand all parts with 120- , 150- , 180- and 220-grit sandpaper . To achieve a smooth finished surface , we applied Behlen Pore-O-Pac filler before staining . First , thin the filler with filler solvent until it has the consistency of thick cream . Working on only a small area at a time , brush the filler into the woodgrain and let it set until it appears dull . Rub the filler off the surface and into the grain with burlap cloths and remove all excess . Allow the filler to dry overnight and sand lightly to remove any residue . <p> To achieve a deep reddish brown , we applied Behlen Solar Lux Medium Brown Mahogany stain . This is a solvent-based dye that dries quickly , so it 's best to add Solar Lux retarder to slow the drying time and prevent lap marks . Let the stain dry overnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our surface finish , we applied three coats of Waterlox Original Sealer/Finish . Liberally soak the wood surface with finish and wait about 20 minutes before wiping off the excess . After overnight drying , lightly sand the surface with 320-grit sandpaper and dust it off thoroughly before applying a second coat . Apply the final coat using the same technique . When the last coat is dry , rub the surface with 4/0 steel wool to remove any dust nibs and give the piece a warm glow . Polish with a soft cloth . Reassemble the desk and install the hardware . To ease drawer and door-support operation , apply a light coat of paste wax to the parts and then polish .
