The heat is a presence . Palpable and relentless , it rolls over Albuquerque like a hot iron . <p> Right behind it come the spring winds , pushing several thousand tons of dust from Arizona on through to Texas . Whistling around the corners of the buildings . Drying the new grass and flowers to brittle straws . Blowing patio furniture into someone else 's yard . Making people yell at the spouse , kick the dog , slap the kid , start smoking again , drink more , drive faster . <p> Michael 's already dressed for work and making coffee when I wander into the kitchen , wrapped in my terry cloth robe , still damp from the shower . I sidle up to kiss his neck , just where his dark hair is starting to creep down over his collar , and wipe away a little smear of shaving cream behind his ear . He reaches around me for his coffee mug and kisses the top of my head absently . <p> " It 's supposed to be hot like this all week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and submerges himself in the newspaper . <p> " Want some cereal ? " I take clean bowls and spoons out of the dishwasher . <p> I pull the box of corn flakes out of the pantry and pour some in my bowl , add milk , and sit down across from him . I 've already eaten about half of my cereal when he looks up . <p> " Hmm ? " <p> " Hmm , what ? " <p> " Did you say something ? " <p> " I asked if you wanted cereal . Since you did n't answer , I took it as a no . " <p> " Sorry . I was thinking . " <p> The coffee maker sighs , announcing the completion of its cycle . I pour some in his cup and set it on the table . " What are you doing today ? " <p> " This morning I 'm meeting with Ted Rossmore . " <p> " Who 's he ? " <p> " Venture capital guy . Then this afternoon I 've got a couple conference calls . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newspaper , the clink of my spoon against the bowl . <p> After a minute or so , I lay my hand on his arm . " Tell me what 's wrong . " <p> He gives me an indulgent smile . " Nothing 's wrong . " <p> " Something feels wrong to me . " <p> " Something always feels wrong to you . It 's your normal state . " He folds up the sports section and smiles at me . The intense blue of his eyes is still startling , even after almost three years of seeing it every day . <p> " Michael  --  " <p> " What ? I do n't know what you want me to say . " <p> " The truth . Whatever it is . " <p> " The truth is , nothing 's wrong . " He pats my hand , which I guess is supposed to be reassuring , but it 's a gesture so unlike him that it has the reverse effect . <p> " Okay , everything 's great . But I still want us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He gets up , pours the dregs of his coffee in the sink . " Tonight , " he says . <p> " Come home early , okay ? I 'll make a big salad and we can have a nice , relaxing  --  " <p> " I will . " He gives me a quick coffee-flavored kiss . <p> The door shuts with that hollow sound , and I stir my soggy corn flakes while reviewing the evidence . <p> Exhibit A. I enter , damp from the shower , smelling of coconut body butter . I brush against him and kiss his neck lightly . His response ? Reaching around me for his coffee mug and a mechanical peck on the top of the head . I did n't expect him to rip my robe off and throw me down on the breakfast table , but a real kiss would not have been out of place . <p> Exhibit B. Monday night . He came home late from his poker game , but I was still awake . I wanted to talk . He said he had e-mails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went to bed , tending the embers of my hurt feelings and resentment . I heard him come out of his office , walk into the living room . When the TV went on , the embers ignited . I marched into the living room and told him I was sick of his lying . He said , lying about what ? I said he did n't really have any e-mails that could n't wait till tomorrow ; he was just avoiding talking to me . I wanted to know why . He said he was tired . I said he was always tired except when there was something he wanted to do . He said this was exactly why he was avoiding talking to me and , for that matter , why he was tired . Why could n't I just cut him some slack , give him a little room to breathe . I said he could have the whole goddamned apartment to breathe in if he wanted it . I said I would leave in the morning . I told him I 'd go stay with Betsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the bedroom , got back in bed , and seethed . <p> He came in about fifteen minutes later , and I pretended to be asleep . He knew I was n't . He did n't take his clothes off . He just lay down next to me , on top of the covers , and put his hands on me . This was his solution to everything . Touching . Sex . I never knew how to tell him that it was those times when I felt the most distance between us . A yawning canyon full of all the things we never said . But that night I was tired , too . I was sad . I wanted him to hold me . I wanted things to be the way they were before . Before I started getting this panicky feeling that maybe things never really had been the way they were before . <p> On the other hand it 's perfectly true , what he said . A perpetual sense of impending doom is my natural state . I should be used to it by now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting to happen . <p> So maybe it 's just the wind . <p> I throw the coverlet up over the pillows  --  about as far as I 'm willing to go toward making the bed . I slip on a gauzy Indian cotton dress , slide my feet into old leather sandals , and run a comb through my still-damp hair . Pull a sweater out of the drawer . It 'll be freezing in the studio . The last thing I do is grab my medicine bundle necklace and loop it over my head . <p> <br> Continues ...
