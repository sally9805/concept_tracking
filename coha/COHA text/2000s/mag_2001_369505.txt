Luring new hires with signing bonuses and in-house masseuses was the game less than a year ago . But today , as the economy staggers , it 's slash-and-burn  --  perks , pay and personnel . The numbers are getting ugly . Outplacement firm Challenger , Gray &; Christmas says announced job cuts for December were the highest since the firm began tracking them in 1993 . And January 's are bound to be even higher . General Electric is poised to idle 75,000 , according to BusinessWeek Online , though GE disputes that figure . <P> Many companies have gone into advanced penny-pinching mode to avoid cuts or further cuts , something they have n't had to do in a decade . " The New Economy makes human capital the most important asset , yet paradoxically companies are finding they ca n't afford the fixed cost of large payrolls in turbulent times , " says former Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich , author of The Future of Success ( Knopf ; $26 ) . <P> Just ask Charles Schwab . Since November , the online broker has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff in the wake of last quarter 's 27% drop in earnings . In late November , the company announced a hiring freeze , followed by discretionary spending controls and salary reductions  --  50% for co-CEOs and 5% to 20% for more than 700 managers . Then in mid-January , Schwab said it would pay first-quarter bonuses in stock , not cash . And just last week , the company told roughly half its 2,600 " nonessential " employees  --  those not involved in customer support  --  to take three unpaid Fridays off during a five-week period starting Feb. 2 . Schwab quickly had to scrap the Friday plan for legal reasons . The leaves will now be " voluntary . " <P> Other companies are also trying to cut creatively . First Union in Charlotte , N.C. , moved its in-house travel center online , then limited first-class travel by executives to red-eye flights . The bank has squeezed vendors , such as office suppliers , to get better pricing and has axed duplicate databases . <P> Most companies are using a combination of layoffs and cutbacks . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were announced ( 4% of its workforce ) , employees are keeping travel costs down by attending corporate meetings via webcasts . And telecommuting is in : 20,000 employees now roll out of bed into the office , compared with 230 in 1995 . <P> For companies under pressure , no cut is too small . Aetna , the nation 's largest health-insurance provider , told its Bluebell , Pa. , employees that they 'll have to start paying for coffee and tea . And for the stressed-out folks at Xerox , fresh bagels no longer grace morning meetings . A Xerox manager asked his group to limit , of all things , the number of copies by using both sides of the paper . Which suggests that along with the losers in the current slowdown , there may be one unexpected winner  --  trees . <P>  --  By Carole Buia
