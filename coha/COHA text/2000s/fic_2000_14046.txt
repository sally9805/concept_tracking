A kitchen in a small $40,000 house built in the Fifties in Casper , Wyoming . There are two posters of early cowboy movies on the wall , and a stitched " Home Sweet Home . " The only unusual feature is a butcherblock island in the middle of an otherwise working-class , run-down space . There are beer cans scattered about and a new six-pack ( with two missing ) on the island . It 's 2:00 A.M. , and Rob sits at the island chugging a beer and perusing the magazine Western Screen . He is a good-looking twenty-six , and the youngest rodeo rider to have won the " World 's Top Cowboy " silver buckle . He is recovering from back and leg injuries inflicted by a rodeo fall . Big 8 , a substantial woman of forty-eight , an ex-rodeo star and expansive personality , carries a beer and is cooking up bacon and eggs in a frying pan on the stove . She is , as usual , in the midst of a rodeo reminiscence . A storm , lightning and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rodeo it 's gone to hell in a handbasket .

She pulls out a box of cereal , rips it open and pours it out on the butcher block . Nope . She stands thinking and looking at the stairs . She experimentally eats a handful of the cereal dry . She takes off her shoes and moves upstairs . All is quiet and still . She comes back down with a cheap jewelry box in one hand and a shoebox in the other . She opens the jewelry box and pours the contents on the butcher block in among the Cheerios . She picks up a silver ring , holds it up to the light and puts it on . She picks around in the rest of the jewelry , discontent . She picks up one more ring , starts to toss it down , stops , listens . She stands frozen for a moment ; then puts the second ring on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner of the butcher block to make a clear space . She dumps the shoebox out . It 's all silver rodeo buckles , close to two dozen . ) Bingo ! ( She picks several up and reads the backs . ) Sterling , sterling , sterling , sterling . Oh , yes . ( She leaves the buckles and goes over to the sink , opening the cabinet below it . She pulls out a box of Hefty tall garbage bags . She takes the bag over to the butcher block and in two or three swipes she gets all the buckles in the bag . She puts the garbage bag on the counter and goes back to the bathroom , emerging with the duffel bag and the clothes she changed out of . Hurriedly , she jams the dirty clothes in her duffel , grabs the garbage bag and heads for the door . Rob appears on the stairs with a silver-plated traditional cowboy sixshooter in his hand .

Yo , I would always tell whoever was on his case that they might , you know , want to drive to another state or whatever . SHIRL See , I 'm pretty sure that was gas . Happens all the time with deceased pigs . ( Sees their concerned , incredulous faces . ) Cross my heart . It was nasty gas , too .
