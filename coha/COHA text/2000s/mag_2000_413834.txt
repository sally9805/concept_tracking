Relying on little more than a photo and a medical report , Lisa Henricksson and her husband adopted a baby boy from Vietnam . The odyssey , she says , was a Labor of Love . Photograph Together at last : The author and her son in New York City , eight months after thead#op#ion. b , // THE MOMENT WE WALKED into our Hanoi hotel room on that sultry September evening , the phone rang . The people from the agency knew our schedule , but this was uncanny . Our luggage had n't even been brought up yet . My husband , Jim , picked up the phone . " We 've got your baby at the office . Can we bring him over ? " It was Ron Clark , the young man who was handling the Hanoi leg of our adoption . Jim tried to sound calm . " How long will that take ? " " About 10 minutes . " " Can you give us 15 ? " We could n't exactly tell Ron to come back later when we might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd meet him in the lobby . Ever the manager , Jim later told me that this was so he could do damage control in case there was a problem . Like , say , they 'd brought the wrong baby . At the appointed time , the concierge rang up to announce Ron and his entourage from the agency , International Mission of Hope . Jim headed for the elevator , as casually , it seemed to me , as if he were going down to sign for a FedEx package . I walked over to the 23rd-floor window and looked out over Hanoi . We 'd been working toward this moment for three difficult years , and now here we were : This wellappointed business traveler 's apartment was to be my delivery room . Feeling hopelessly unequal to what was about to happen , I waited for the door to open . I was over 40 before I realized I would do anything to have a child . Possessing the arrogance of the lucky , I had assumed I could have it all-the fulfilling career , the wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This proved to be a tragically careless assumption , as I discovered after marrying at 41 . When several years of trying with the latest high-tech baby-making techniques yielded three miscarriages , Jim and I knew we had to start working on adoption before we were too depleted to go through with it . Though it seems obvious to an outsider , one of the many wonderful things about adoption is its certainty . At the end of the process , providing you have conscientiously followed every step , there will be a baby . Not the stubborn grief and the reproachful pile of medical bills that are the legacy of failed fertility procedures . An actual baby . Naturally , we 'd thought of this before , but now that we had been yanked awake from our dream of a biological child , it seemed ridiculously simple . A knowledgeable friend had told us that Spence-Chapin , an agency on Manhattan 's Upper East Side , was the best in our area . Following a thorough grilling by a psychologist &gt; about our mental fitness to be parents , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew we wanted an international adoption ( domestic adoption of an infant in New York is spectacularly daunting ) but had n't decided on a country . Jim and I were too old to adopt a baby from most countries Spence-Chapin dealt with . If we wanted a toddler , the options were much greater-China , Korea , Bulgaria , Colombia-but we were concerned about developmental delays and really wanted to nurture an infant . That left Cambodia , Guatemala , certain parts of Russia , and Vietnam . For us , this decision was a voodoo-ish mix of research , affinity , and intuition . A colleague of Jim 's who 'd adopted a baby boy from Vietnam piqued our interest with his enthusiasm . " The children are all so beautiful ! " he marveled , and that comment lodged seductively in our minds . We learned that children are revered in the Vietnamese culture , so the baby would have gotten plenty of love and attention in his orphanage . And unlike Russia , which we were also considering , Vietnam was mostly free of HIV , drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for adoption because the mother was unmarried or the family could not afford another child . Vietnam , which had reopened to international adoption only recently , was still a pilot program for Spence-Chapin . In 1998 , the agency handled only five adoptions from Vietnam out of a total 603 for the entire U.S. China , on the other hand , accounted for some 4000 adoptions from the U.S. that same year . But far from being put off by Vietnam 's newness , we were drawn to its exoticism . At that time , we could also choose the baby 's sex , though boys were more available than girls and there would be a longer wait for a girl . Jim wanted a boy , I wanted a girl , and for a while we were at an impasse . But the more I thought about the complicated nature of the mother-daughter relationship ( and the teenage torture I had inflicted on my own mother ) , the more attractive the idea of an adoring , uncritical son became . When the time came , we checked " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photo , left , Nguyen Van Binh ( at three months ) appeared bug-eyed . But by the time his new parents claimed him ( at five months ) , he was well-developed , below . Right : Looking out over the city of Hanoi from the hotel . // Throughout the winter and spring , the adoption became a second job . After work , we attended a series of group meetings meant to educate us about every aspect of adoption . We wrote letters to imaginary birth mothers and discussed how we 'd react if someone taunted our child with a racial epithet . ( An important conversation , since Jim and I , of Scandinavian and Irish heritage respectively , are the whitest of white people . ) We produced mountains of notarized copies of documents stamped with gold seals that proved we were not dangerous felons . We were fingerprinted twice . We had our social worker , Alexandra Miller , over for coffee so she could judge whether our apartment was fit for a child . For the first time ever , out came the Wedgwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were ready for what 's known in adoption lingo as the referral-a name and a picture . Adoption is a cosmic crapshoot . If there are no obvious health problems with the baby whom the agency proposes , and he fits your previously agreed upon criteria , well , that 's your child . You 're not strolling down the aisles of the baby supermarket , eyeballing and squeezing until you find the perfect little peach . That principle was driven home to us when we were presented with Nguyen Van Binh . Alex told us about a three- &gt; month-old boy who was being cared for at the Tu Liem Feeding Center just outside of Hanoi . He was the right age , and the scant medical report we were supplied with indicated that he was healthy . The only sticking point was the complete lack of information about his parents . Despite Vietnam 's helpful attitude toward parents who officially give up their children for adoption , this baby had been abandoned . The police report included this statement ( excuse the translation ) from the woman to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning I and Mr. Nguyen Van Viet on the way to Van Phuc for purchasing bricks for house building . When going down the dike slope , due to two great lorries passing across the road , Photograph New mother , from left : Henricksson and son in Hanoi ; greeting a friendly local after the giving-and-receiving ceremony . // I missed Mr. Viet and while waiting at the slope end , I saw a woman stepping down from the lorry with a baby in hands . The mother asked me for the way to Ninh Xa . " However the woman returned after a time of hesitance and asked me to carry the baby for her going out to make water at the bush . After a long time of waiting from morning to 01 hr p.m. the mother did n't return for the child . I could not do anything but to bring the child to nearest Police Board to inform the case for settlement . When opening the wrappage , mother 's letter has been found which asked people 's forgiveness , because the mother is unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moses in the bulrushes was heartbreakingly incomplete . We had hoped that we might meet the birth parents at the giving-and-receiving ceremony , a legal procedure in which the state formally recognizes the adoption . When I first heard about this , it sounded excruciating , but eventually I came to see the wisdom of it for both the child and for us . If we decided to adopt Nguyen Van Binh , we 'd have nothing to go on , not even a copy of the letter left in the baby 's blanket . What we had was a tiny mug shot of a strange  --  looking infant , kind of an X-Files baby with a head shaped like a lightbulb and eyes that were huge and fierce . When Alex handed us the picture , we were speechless . This glimpse into the future is a loaded moment for any adoptive parent , and we waited for her cue . She quickly said something about how the flash must have startled him , causing his bug-eyed expression . Absolutely , we agreed , that must be it . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this world , we said yes to Nguyen Van Binh . Adoptions in Vietnam were moving quickly , so we could expect to travel in three to six months . International Mission of Hope , the agency in Hanoi that actually locates the children and handles the adoption with the Vietnamese government , kept sending us snapshots of Binh , as we now called him , each one worse than before . He had evolved from an alien baby to a 25-year-old thug in San Jose Sharks sweatpants . He looked sullen and pissed off in his bouncy seat . Then one afternoon in July , Alex sent us a set of new photos of Binh . What a difference ! Someone had bothered to get down and photograph him at baby level . He was adorable . He no longer looked pop-eyed but alert and intelligent . His head was nicely shaped . We saw that he could push himself up from the floor with his arms and " swim " on his stomach ( both important developmental milestones ) . I studied these pictures every night before going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call finally came in late August . We could pick up the child on Monday , September 6 . Because of the epic nature of this trip , we did it as pleasantly as possible , flying the 17 hours to Hong Kong , where we stayed for a couple of days to sleep off the jet lag , then on to Hanoi . Our hotel , the Hanoi Towers , was built over the site of the notorious Hanoi Hilton , where American soldiers were imprisoned during the war . Of course , it was ironic that this same piece of real estate now provided cushy housing for business travelers , but we were n't dwelling on ironies at the moment . And here 's where this story began , with me confronting my future in a Hanoi hotel room . With my heart banging hard against my chest , I counted every second of the few minutes it took Jim to return with three young men and a pretty Vietnamese woman holding a baby . The woman was smiling . " Here 's your son , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish I could say this was a radiant , Lifetime moment with a Sarah McLachlan ballad welling up in the background . ) But as I took him into my arms , he felt more like a frightened animal than my child . He did n't cry or struggle , but since his head was buried in my shoulder , I could n't even see him , let alone get much sense of him . Ron introduced us to Bobo , a Romanian who spoke Vietnamese . Bobo was the facilitator ; he would travel with us and guide us through the acres of red tape we still had to negotiate before we could take the baby home . Ron then explained Binh 's feeding and sleeping schedules , told us Binh liked looking in the mirror , and gave us some medication for an incipient ear infection . After about 15 minutes , they wished us luck and took off , leaving us alone with two bottles , a can of formula , and our new baby . Yikes . Binh 's response to this momentous handover was to fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ babyness of him . He was wearing a flimsy little blue outfit with the words Kiss Kiss written across the front ; someone had obviously gussied him up to meet his new parents . We 'd been warned that the child may be underweight and would almost certainly have scabies , so we were amazed at what a sleek , robust little guy Binh was . Considering that he 'd just been taken from the only home he 'd ever known and dumped into a brand-new environment with a couple of strangers , he was remarkably chipper . He smiled a lot , a wide , face-cracking grin that showed off his two tiny bottom teeth . We 'd been told that some babies shut down when faced with their new parents , but Binh was resilient . I was , if not yet in love , completely captivated . So it was perplexing the next day when , preparing for the giving-and-receiving ceremony , I was suddenly incapacitated with nausea and vomiting . It was a full-out panic attack . This child was beautiful and charming beyond all expectation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this demanding little creature intrude on our happy marriage , our easy , ordered life ? We 're in our 40s , for God 's sake . What were we thinking ? I could n't even look at the baby without feeling ill . Jim , who thought I was suffering from some traveler 's ailment , told me I 'd be fine and that we should get going . I was too weak to argue , so I gave him the baby and stumbled into the van . Fortunately , the Justice Department was just three blocks away . The ceremony , held at a horseshoe-shaped conference table under the red-and-yellow banner of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam , had a clarifying effect . It was simple and straightforward , without any emotional flourishes . Sign the register here ; shake hands ; he 's yours . The officials seemed almost amused when Jim got up and gave a heartfelt speech of thanks to the government for making our dreams come true . During the ceremony , my nausea began to subside and my plastered-on grin , which I hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real one . He was legally ours now , and I was ready to be his mother . Our week in Hanoi passed in a fog of giddy exhaustion . At the time , the baby , whom we were calling Benjamin because Ben was close to Binh , had a schedule that involved going to bed at 6:30 Pm. and waking every two or three hours . Simply keeping him alive wore us out so utterly that by 6:30 we could barely see . But when we did manage to stagger out with Ben in the Baby Bjorn , it became obvious that times have changed in Vietnam . Wherever we took him , women clucked at him and tickled him , asking , " Your son ? How many months ? " When we ventured out to lunch at a nearby cafe , the waitresses begged to play with him while we ate . They were much more delighted with the child than they were curious about his origins . On Saturday , Bobo called to tell us Ben 's passport had come through so we could move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work on the visa . About halfway through our weeklong stay in Saigon , while I was drinking a completely necessary Tiger beer at 11:00 A.mt. and Jim was watching his new favorite Australian soap opera , he turned to me and said , " I do n't think he 's a Benjamin . " Maybe it was the Tiger talking , but I agreed . Though I 'd originally come up with a long list of fancy names , including Leo , August , Julian , and Tobias , I returned to the first name we 'd ever discussed . " You 're right , " I said . " Let 's call him Luke . " And Luke he remains . On Friday , we left Saigon for an overnight stay in Hong Kong before heading home . We wanted to indulge ourselves on our last night in Asia , so , with Luke asleep in a crib , we ordered dinner and a bottle of wine . The lights were dimmed way down and I stood by the door so I could intercept the room-service waiter before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table with flowers , a white tablecloth , and covered dishes , and we sat down to eat , five feet away from our beautiful , slumbering son . Whispering across the table to each other in the dark , we squeezed each other 's hand , ecstatic that now we were three . So this is a blessedly smooth adoption story . Our luggage did n't even get lost . Luke has been with us for more than a year now , and I 'm almost embarrassed at how normal our family seems . Because Manhattan 's Upper West Side is probably one of the most accepting places a transracial family could live , we 've gotten lots of questions but not a single unkind comment . Luke has n't exhibited any developmental delays or unusual illnesses . Our friends with kids get a strange look in their eye when we tell them he 's been sleeping through the night . And our somewhat reserved families have embraced him with a warmth that 's surprised us both . When I was in the grip of infertility madness , if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a last resort , a consolation prize . Only when I let go of what I thought I could n't live without did I find unalloyed happiness . When Luke is old enough to understand his origins , things will get more complicated . But we 're off to the best start we could have imagined . <p>
