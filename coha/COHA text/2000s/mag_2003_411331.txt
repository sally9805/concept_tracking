. I turned the rearview mirror so I could look into the backseat . Two boys , aged 12 , sat strapped happily in the back of my van . Gordon , my son , clutched a wood duck as if it were a stuffed animal . Nathan , next to him , was playing with the long bill of the snipe he 'd shot . Curious as to how they 'd respond , I asked : " Does n't it bother you guys that we killed things today ? " I 'm not sure they even spoke . They did n't have to . I could read their astonished expressions : Had n't we gone hunting to kill birds ? Was n't that the whole point ? I should n't have been surprised , even if it was my first weekend of hunting with kids . Part of me thought that as seventh graders , the boys were old enough to feel the conflicted emotions about killing that we adults often experience . But at 12 , the boys were no different than all the younger children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch-and-release was a good idea . Most kids do n't consider a fish caught until it 's on a plate and underneath a lemon wedge . It 's not that they lust to kill . They just want very badly to bring something home . Taking these boys afield over the last two seasons , I 've tried to help them discover other kinds of trophies : an appreciation of nature and a knowledge of wildlife behavior . Nathan saw a vivid illustration of the pecking order in turkey society when an agitated hen picked a fight with our decoy , strutted and fanned her tail at it , then ran away , putting angrily . Gordon , a horror movie buff , will never forget the Hitchcockian cloud of thousands of blackbirds that swirled noisily into the cattails behind us during a duck hunt . In between serious lessons in bird and animal identification , I 'd take time to show them the joy of jumping on dried puffball mushrooms , or we 'd put the guns down for a quick acorn fight . At first , I never took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , teaching , making sure the boys were safe . A hunt with kids needs to be totally about them , conducted at their pace , pitched to their endurance level and attention span . We 're always ready to take a snack break or quit before we get too cold , tired , or bored . I started to really enjoy not carrying a gun . Feeling no tension about shooting anything , I was free to fully enjoy the kids ' excitement . And I 've got my ulterior motives : If I keep these boys hooked , in a few years , I 'll have strong , young backs to take the place of mine at decoy-humping and deer-dragging time . There 's another , greater , burden on those strong young backs . They represent the future of hunting and conservation . There are plenty of candidates ready for the job , too . I 've watched Cub Scouts at a day camp step up to the firing line of the BB gun station , and it 's obviously the highlight of their day . They stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and proudly carry the targets home . For too many , however , a few shots a year at summer camp is the closest they ever come to hunting . NATHAN AND GORDON My son 's classmate Nathan represents those hunters we lose without even knowing it . Aside from an ecstatic week each summer when he could spend all his free time at camp shooting .225 , Nathan had no exposure to firearms . Yet from the time he was young , he liked to wear hunting clothes , backpacks , and camo hats . He was all dressed up with no place to go because neither his father nor his mother came from a hunting background . Fortunately , Nathan 's mother mentioned her son 's enthusiasm to my wife one day . Pam asked me if I 'd mind taking him out . Nathan 's parents thought I was doing them a tremendous favor , when , in fact , it was quite the other way around . My son , Gordon , represents the traditional model of recruitment to the ranks of hunters . Like me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dogs . Brushing English setter hair off his backpack is part of getting ready for school , and picking pellets out of his teeth is dinner-table routine . Gordon would either express an interest in hunting or he would n't , but there was never any doubt that he 'd have the opportunity . He came along a few times on duck and squirrel hunts when he was 8 or 9 and was always happy as long as he had a book and some snacks . After a while , I 'd ask him if he wanted to go and he 'd say , " Do I get to shoot anything ? " When both boys turned 12 , it was time to take them hunting . PLANNING Doing anything with overscheduled suburban kids requires making plans long in advance . In the spring , my wife , Nathan 's mother , and I compared calendars and marked the dates of their first hunts . With the days " on the calendar " in ink ( we modern husbands have learned to dread the phrase " it 's not on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunter education and spent the summer teaching them to shoot shotguns . D-Day ( Duck Day ) fell early in October . I 'd picked the Federal Youth Waterfowl Hunt days  --  a weekend set aside for kids only  --  as the boys ' first outing . Scouting with a fervor I rarely muster for my own hunting , I found a pile of ducks feeding in a thick stand of millet a short walk from an easy parking spot . I enlisted my friend M.D. to serve as Nathan 's personal ammo bearer . With M.D. would come his collection of 50 yard-sale lawn chairs covered with camo tape  --  the perfect marsh seats  --  and another father and son . We were ready . THE HUNT We all met an hour before shooting light , giving us time to set everything up . We left the three boys to sleep in the cars and went to work . The woodies flushed , squealing in protest at our arrival as we waded in to set the lawn chairs in foot-deep water . We tucked the seats back among the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour before sunrise found us hidden in the millet , an adult crouching behind each kid , ready to administer ammo , hot chocolate , granola bars , hand warmers , and advice . The wood ducks came back in twos and threes at first light . Teal and mallards flew later . At morning 's end , a flock of pintails circled warily for 10 minutes before landing in the spread . Two-thirds of the shooters shot a couple of pintails , two drake woodies , a greenhead , and a shoveler . The remaining third , my son , shot nothing but sky . Caught up in self-congratulation at putting my shooters into swarms of ducks , I was too thick to notice Gordon 's disappointment . It was one of the best duck hunts I 'd ever been on , and I made the mistake of saying so at great length . Gordon wore a brave face until we got home , then informed his mother that he had been humiliated , his father was insensitive and clueless , and he would not go tomorrow . Pam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gordon stoically set his alarm for 4:30 . The next morning , just Gordon , Nathan , and I went out . We waded a few steps from shore , where I filled a pair of 5-gallon buckets partway with water and snapped the lids in place to make stable seats . I threw two dozen decoys onto the black , motionless water . Only a few ducks stirred as the sun rose over the placid marsh . A river otter swam through the decoys . White pelicans skimmed low , their wing tips nearly brushing the surface like the Spruce Goose on its maiden flight . It took Gordon precisely the amount of time required to finish three cups of hot chocolate to realize that the best parts of hunting can be the long intervals between trigger pulls . " Dad , " he asked , slurping down the dregs of that third cup , " when can we go again ? " His reward , and my redemption for the errors of the day before , came wrapped in olive-gray feathers . A hen wood duck buzzed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chance was Gordon 's alone . He lurched to his feet , swung , and shot . The bird splashed down with a broken wing , and I was off in pursuit , the duck leading me out to the middle of the bay . I was n't letting this bird escape if I had to take Gordon 's gun apart , dive beneath the surface , and breathe through the barrel to continue the chase . Cold water trickled over the top of my waders as I caught the duck and turned to carry it back to my son waiting on shore . Even from that far away , he looked taller . GROWING INTO HUNTERS In the two years I 've been hunting with them , the boys have grown from kids into young teenagers . Soon they 'll have to face the realities of crowds , leases , fees , dwindling access  --  lessons I still do n't know how to teach them . " You mean you can hunt here anywhere ? " Nathan asked me as we drove past acres of prime pheasant cover on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just hunted the youth pheasant season , when kids age 12 to 15 can take one bird the weekend before the regular season begins . Gordon had killed his bird with me in the morning . Nathan ended the afternoon hunt with one shot after 45 minutes . I could see the wheels turning in Nathan 's head as he looked out the window . He was imagining hunting on his own on this place : 13,000 acres , 15 minutes from town , full of birds , not a soul on it but us . " Yeah , it belongs to the state . It 's open to everyone , " I said , biting back the rest : Starting next weekend , this place will be full of people every day . Not too many birds survive the first two weeks of the season . It 's a long way between roosters after that . When you 're too old for youth season , you 'll find out for yourself . It 's natural to want to shelter them . But these boys have the desire to hunt even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunt , and it 's nowhere near as accepted as it was when I was young . So I have to put aside my misgivings and believe that they 'll grow up to make their own way in whatever hunting world we bequeath them . The alternative is to write off the next generation of hunters as already lost , insulated from the wild in the suburbs , absorbed in television , sports , video games , and trips to the mall . If that 's true , whose fault is it ? MY LESSON For kids , an animal brought back from a hunt is more than a souvenir . It 's a trophy , commemorating achievement . It 's a real , live dead thing . At a time in their lives when kids are coming to terms with the permanence of death , an animal in hand makes the abstract concrete . It 's probably fair to say that not too many people in the suburban development where Nathan lives had ever seen a dead turkey until we hauled a 25-pound gobbler into his parents garage last spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled the garage where I was showing Nathan how to clean his turkey . Not one of them offered the expected " Ewwww , gross . " Instead , they flapped the wings , opened and shut the beak , played with the big , scaly feet . Kids are still kids , fascinated by the real deal . It 's up to us to help them find it . TEACHING KIDS SAFETY It 's safer for kids to hunt than to , say , grind skateboards down handrails . Nevertheless , training safe hunters remains our most important responsibility . At what age should kids start learning safe gun handling and hunting skills ? My state offers hunter-safety courses to children 12 and older , which seems about the right age for kids to start hunting . During those middle-school years of 11 to 13 , children grow big enough to handle a gun . Mentally , they become much more aware of the world around them . The painful self-consciousness and strong desire to conform that afflict early adolescents are qualities you like to see in someone carrying a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to one cardinal rule : Keep the muzzle pointed in a safe direction . We started with duck and turkey hunting , sedentary pursuits where I could sit right behind the kids and keep a close eye on their gun handling . Upland hunting I saved for last , as it involves walking with a gun and making split-second shoot-or-don't-shoot decisions . At first , kids are extremely conscientious but not skilled at handling firearms . Later , you have to watch them as they become more familiar with the guns ; that 's when they 'll start to slip and cut corners ( just as adults do ) . Whenever we go hunting , I remind the boys that any time they behave unsafely , or do n't do what I say , the hunt will end immediately . It 's no idle threat , but thus far , I 'm pleased to say , we 've never had to put away the guns and come home early .  --  P.B. YOUTH GUNS The best teaching shotgun for kids is a soft-shooting , scaled-down , 20-gauge gas-operated autoloader . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beretta 's new 3901 RL . Recoil reduction is absolutely vital in a training gun . Think the lightweight 20-gauge single-shot or pump you bought your child does n't kick ? Shoot it once off your left shoulder and you 'll see what it feels like to someone who has n't spent years learning to brace against recoil . Hand traps that lob wobbly , inconsistent targets are worthless for teaching kids . You need a trap like a Trius that will fling a clay along the same path again and again . If you 're starting out your kid with a .22 rimfire , the new single-shot Savage MiniCub is just the right size . Not only is it scaled down for a child 's hands , but it has no external hammer or cocking knob to confound little fingers . The MiniCub has a peep sight , which is much easier for new shooters to use than conventional iron sights , and the receiver is grooved for scope mounting . That said , when it came time to teach my young hunters to shoot rifles , I bought a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being inexpensive and a hoot to shoot . I mounted a Kahles 2X-7X rimfire scope on it and let the kids riddle Birchwood Casey 's Shoot-N-Cs ( which show a bright green mark the instant the bullet strikes ) , clang metal spinner targets , and ventilate that plinking standby , the endlessly shootable aluminum can .  --  P.B. Illustration <p>                     @x Friday , December 16  --  9:25 p.m . <br> <br> My wife , Sara , and I are hosting a faculty party at our home when the Clark Falls Police Department arrives to take me into custody . <br> It 's the last day of the fall semester . On campus , offices are darkened , final exams completed , lecture halls standing empty until the new year . Most of our colleagues , a few graduate students , and assorted companions have retreated here , at our invitation , to shake off the cold and brace for the holidays . <br> The house smells like mulled cider and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation bubbles and alcohol flows . I 'm at the foot of the staircase with Warren Giler , the chancellor 's husband , where we 've found common ground on Islay scotch , the ' 04 Red Sox , and a mutual ambivalence regarding faculty parties . Winter air threads its way into the festivities . <br> " I 'm sorry ? " I hear my wife say . She 's standing at the front door in her dress and heels , talking to a man in an overcoat . I see two uniformed officers behind him , breathing clouds on our stoop . " Can you tell me what this is about ? " <br> " Uh-oh , " Giler says to me . " Those men look stern . " <br> He 's right . They do . " I 'd better go help , " I tell him . " You 're not wanted , are you ? " <br> " Not to my knowledge . Possibly the music is too loud ? " <br> I chuckle and excuse myself . Sara gives me a worried look as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her hair up . <br> " Evening , guys . " I smile . " Cold tonight . " <br> " Paul Callaway ? " <br> " That 's right . " There are two squad cars parked in front of our house , plus an unmarked sedan in our driveway , behind the catering van . " Is something wrong ? " <br> The man in the overcoat reproduces the badge he 's just shown Sara , a gold shield seated in a black leather wallet . He stands medium height , trim and efficient-looking , gray hair neatly combed . Detective Bell , according to the ID card . " Mr. Callaway , we 're here to place you under arrest . " <br> " Excuse me ? " <br> Bell hands me a folded document . " I 'll give you a minute to find a coat . " <br> Sara takes the papers out of my hand . " Let me see that . " <br> " Guys , " I say . " Obviously there 's a mistake . " <br> " I 'll give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a coat . " <br> Our guests are starting to pay closer attention . The simmering stew of conversation thins near the door . Sara , leafing through what appears to be a court-issued arrest warrant , takes a short breath and whispers , " Paul . . . " <br> " I 'm telling you , I do n't even have any parking tickets . Arrest me for what ? " <br> " Suspicion of the sexual exploitation of a minor , " Bell informs me , this time louder than strictly necessary . He produces a second document . " This entitles us to search the premises , as well as your office on campus . " <br> " My office on campus ? " I do n't even have an office on campus . I have a mailbox and a table I like in the faculty lounge . In the pin-drop background , all conversation has ceased . I hear the silence rippling through the house , but I 've had three rounds of scotch with Warren Giler and now I 've lost my temper . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can instruct the officers to handcuff and Mirandize you right here on the steps if that 's the way you 'd prefer to accomplish this . " Bell looks me in the eyes . " But I can see that you 're having a party . " <br> " Some detective . " <br> Sara says , " Paul . . . " <br> In spite of the shock I know exactly who 's behind this little production . But it still does n't make any sense . Sexual what ? I picture all of this from the point of view of one of our guests  --  say for instance Warren Giler , the chancellor 's husband  --  and I realize that by reacting the way any reasonable person might , I 'm only making things worse . In fact , I can see in the tense , readied looks on the faces of the two officers flanking Detective Bell that I 'm possibly one good outburst away from getting Tasered in my own doorway . <br> " This has to be a joke , " I say . <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent . " Detective Bell stands aside as one of the officers moves his hand to the cuffs on his belt . <br> " Jesus . " I kiss Sara on the forehead , break away , and reach for the closet . <br> " Paul , this says . . . " <br> " It 's okay . " I nod inside the house . " See if anybody in there knows a lawyer who can make things as unpleasant as possible for Detective Bell and his teenage sons here . " <br> " I want your badge numbers before you leave , " Sara says . " All of you . " She 's taken her administrative tone , and something about the sound of it fills my heart with gratitude . It tells me  --  if I needed to know  --  that despite all we 've been through these past few months , we 're still playing on the same team . <br> For the moment , that 's all I need to set aside the fundamental injustice under way here , swallow the hundred protests clanging in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorstep . I put on my coat and join the two officers waiting to escort me to the curb . <br> The night air is a bracing slap that leaves me hyperalert , yet strangely numb at the same time . On either side of me , I can feel the officers ' hands on my elbows . I can feel the flagstones beneath the soles of my shoes . I can hear myself breathing , feel the hairs freezing in my nostrils , but none of it feels real . <br> At the curb , the cop on my left cuffs my hands in front of me and puts me in the back of the lead squad unit , behind the wire cage . The other cop finishes informing me , in case I did n't catch it the first time , of my right to remain silent . As to rights , I have a number of others , and he lets me know about those . Do I understand ? <br> No . <br> I nod my head anyway . The door slams shut , muffling the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps back to our front door , where he says something to Detective Bell , then something to Sara . Giving his badge number as requested , I presume . The silence around me is punctuated by the occasional soft crackle of the police radio up front . The car smells like peppermint and sweat . <br> After a few moments , the officer returns and gets in behind the wheel . <br> " I know you 're just doing your job , " I tell him through the wire cage , " but this is bullshit . " <br> He makes a sound like it is n't a shift until somebody tells him that . How old is this kid ? Except for the uniform , and the gun that goes with it , he looks like he could be a new freshman on campus . <br> " Out of curiosity , who am I supposed to have exploited ? I 'd really love to know . " <br> The officer speaks a few words into his radio in a code-riddled language I do n't understand , then fastens his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the first on the left as you enter the circle , making it the last house you 'd pass as you leave . All of our guests ' cars are facing my direction . But these cops came in backward , straight to our address , which means that we have to drive clockwise all the way around in order to exit , past each of our neighbors , one by one . Through the foggy backseat window , I see Pete and Melody Seward 's porch light go dark as we roll past . <br> " I guess these cars do n't go in reverse , " I say , still too angry to be humiliated . We pass Trish and Barry Firth 's house , now Michael and Ben 's . I saw Michael not half an hour ago , in our kitchen , tutoring the caterers . " Why did n't you back up into the driveway , turn around  --  wait , but then you could n't have paraded me around the neighborhood first . You 're right , this is much better . " <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cop finally says . " Whoever can be quietest all the way to the station wins . How about that ? " <br> " Gee , I do n't know , Officer . " Condescending prick . " Who gets to judge ? " <br> Sycamore Court is decked for the holidays . All around the circle , white light drips like icicles from the dormers and eaves . Tendrils of smoke curl from the chimneys , and all the trees twinkle in the cold . I see a wet glint in the dark as the cop 's eyes flicker to the mirror again . <br> " That 's a good point , " he says . " I guess it 'll have to be your word against mine . Sir . " <br> We 're almost all the way around now . Between the squat stone pillars on either side of the entrance , I see the black ribbon of newly topped asphalt that will take us around the tree line , down the hill , and into the thick of Ponca Heights , the newer housing development below . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's house as we roll past , directly across the circle from ours . His dark windows seem to be watching us . I sense the meaning in the cop 's eyes , still fixed on me in the mirror : Get the picture ? <br> For the first time , I feel a chill in my joints that has nothing to do with the weather . I get the picture . <br> Off we go . <br> Chaprter Two <br> <br> Our neighbors say they ca n't believe how much Clark Falls has grown . They wonder where all the people are coming from . <br> Sara and I came from Boston , and to us , Clark Falls feels more or less like what it is : a pleasant little university town fifteen hundred miles from Boston . The city proper tucks up against a range of forested bluffs , which rise unexpectedly from the Iowa flatlands and run along the eastern bank of the Missouri River . We 've learned that these bluffs are known as the Loess Hills , which explains the town slogan found on welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loess Is More . <br> Forty-five thousand people live here , sixty thousand during the school term . According to the plaque on the front steps of the courthouse , the original township , built up around the frontier fur trade , earned its name for the modest tumble of springwater William Clark pointed out to Meriwether Lewis some months into their storied walk to the Pacific Ocean two hundred years ago . <br> We do n't go up the front steps of the courthouse . Instead , I 'm driven around back to a secured parking facility , then escorted into the adjoining building , which houses the Clark Falls Municipal Jail . <br> I realize that I 've been anticipating the police station . I know what the inside of the police station looks like because Sara and I went there together , back in July , to leaf through mug shots . I 've been thinking of the police station , not the jail , and that 's the first thing that makes all of this start to sink in . <br> The officer who drove me here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fur-collared duty coat  --  stops in a frosty vestibule and checks his gun at a bank of small gray lockers . He takes the locker key in one hand , my elbow in the other , and pushes on through the next set of doors . <br> I 'm led down a buzzing fluorescent corridor , past two officers on their way out , and into a grimy central pod for booking . A middle-aged desk sergeant with veins in his cheeks sits me down in a cold plastic chair . He asks me questions without looking at me , hunts and pecks at a plastic-covered keyboard . I 'm entering the system . <br> " When does somebody explain this ? " I shift in my chair . " Where 's Detective Bell ? " <br> " Address of residency , " the sergeant says . <br> I can only imagine what the sergeant must be thinking . Would n't an innocent man have asked for an explanation already ? <br> Or maybe the sergeant could n't care less . Maybe he 's just waiting for my information so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his computer screen . <br> Why did n't I take the time to read the arrest warrant ? There I was , marching out of the house with a righteous stride , and now I do n't know the first thing about the charges against me . I feel like I 've leapt off the end of a sturdy dock onto a frozen pond , and the ice is cracking all around me . <br> The sergeant is waiting . <br> " I 'd like to make a phone call , " I say . <br> " Address . " <br> I take a deep breath and let it out slowly . Now the sergeant finally looks at me . He raises his eyebrows . <br> " Thirty-four Sycamore Court , " I tell him , starting the gears of the justice machine turning again . <br> I know that Clark Falls is n't Boston . It ca n't be more than fifteen degrees outside , the local bars wo n't close for three more hours , and I have no frame of reference in the first place , but still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Except for me and the desk sergeant , the intake area is bright and vacant . <br> A plate of crumbs and candy sprinkles sits in a puddle of red cellophane on a nearby table . There 's a spindly artificial Christmas tree standing cockeyed in the corner ; colored lights blink a few times , chase each other around the frazzled branches , then blink again . <br> I follow the faint crackle of radio chatter to a glass partition labeled Dispatch , where a young woman wearing a bulky holiday sweater and a radio headset sits behind a shoulder-high console , working the controls . I hear Officer Mischnik joking around with somebody down the hall . In a moment , I see him emerge with a foam cup in one hand , steam curling around the rim . He pauses to chat up the dispatcher through the glass . <br> Sitting here , hands cuffed in my lap , robotically answering these questions about the mundane nuts and bolts of my life , it strikes me that , on the right side of things , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a while and go home again . In between , they joke and eat cookies and earn paychecks . <br> There 's no way to get comfortable in this chair . The desk sergeant pokes at the keys and squints at his screen . Hard steel gnaws at my wrist bones . I forgot to put on gloves before I stalked out of the house , and my hands are freezing . <br> I 'm on the wrong side of things . <br> This is happening . <br> Continues ...
