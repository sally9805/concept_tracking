In part 3 of our ongoing series , 3 women , each trying to build a family , have been waiting on some important  --  and nerve-racking  --  developments . Will Jody 's latest fertility treatment succeed ? Will Carrie 's labor go smoothly ? On these pages , read about their latest challenges and triumphs . This month in The Fertility Diaries , REDBOOK revisits three Cleveland-area friends , each of whom has taken a different path to parenthood . Jody Urbas , 33 , begins her first cycle of in vitro fertilization ( IVF ) , following a miscarriage and several failed attempts to get pregnant using other assisted reproductive methods . Jenny Taylor , 27 , who had baby Nora with the help of fertility medications barely a year after the tragic death of her newborn son from sudden infant death syndrome ( SIDS ) , now copes with that memory and her anxieties as she cares for her second child . And Carrie Brainerd , 31 , who became pregnant just as soon as she started trying , eagerly awaits the birth of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some people celebrate the new year with a glass of champagne . Jody Urbas rang in 2007 with a shot in the behind . Photograph : Jody She had spent the week between Christmas and New Year 's getting daily injections of two fertility drugs  --  Gonal-F and Repronex , both designed to spur egg development for the in vitro fertilization process she was about to undergo . Almost every day , she 'd visited her reproductive endocrinologist  --  a doctor specializing in fertility  --  to have her hormone levels tested . " I was there on Christmas Eve , New Year 's Eve , New Year 's Day  --  pretty much every day except Christmas Day ! " says Jody , a teacher of the hearing impaired . Her surging hormone levels helped the doctor estimate how many eggs she would likely produce and when it would be time to trigger ovulation . ( See " What to Expect During IVF , " page 180 . ) Photograph : Carrie That time came at 8:30 p.m. on New Year 's Eve . Celebrating at home , Jody asked her friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trigger shot " ( human chorionic gonadotropin , or hCG ) . " The injection has to be timed precisely , so that they know exactly when you should come in for your egg retrieval , " Jody explains . On New Year 's Day , already feeling a heaviness and bloating in her ovaries , Jody returned to her doctor for an ultrasound and blood work . He confirmed that she could return for egg retrieval the next day , January 2 . Jody : I went in at 6:15 a.m . I 'd already taken Valium and Vicodin at 5:30 a.m. like the doctor 's office told me to , because although it 's minor , egg retrieval is a surgical procedure . They say you 're usually not completely out during the procedure , but you do n't remember anything . I could hear voices and I remember them saying , " We got one egg ! " Then around 10 or 10:30 , my husband , Scott , had to give his sperm . Because not all of Scott 's sperm are normal , the doctor used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selected the best sperm to inject into the eggs . Photograph : JODY " I 'd read about people who ended up with no eggs to implant and think , That 's going to be us ! " They fertilized three good eggs using ICSI , and we had to wait five days while the fertilized eggs developed enough so that the doctor was sure that they were viable . Some clinics will put the eggs back in at three days , but five days gives a higher success rate . I was afraid they 'd tell me that none of the eggs made it . That was my nightmare . But all three made it until day five  --  the day they transferred them back into my uterus . After the egg transfer , Jody was sent home with instructions to stay on bed rest for two days  --  no showering , getting up only to go to the bathroom , and sitting up only to eat . Twelve days later , her doctor would do a pregnancy test . Until then , all Jody could do was wait . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While she was getting her hCG shot on New Year 's Eve , her pal Carrie was taking a nap to make sure that she 'd be awake at midnight  --  she was just over seven months pregnant and due on February 21 . Carrie , a marketing manager , and her husband , John , 32 , planned to spend the first weeks of January decorating the baby 's nursery . Her pregnancy had been remarkably easy , but time was starting to drag as she eagerly awaited her baby 's birth . Carrie : Toward the end of January , I was so tired and so busy at work that I think my body just blew up in protest . I literally gained about 6 pounds of water weight . Thankfully , due to a relaxing weekend , most of that went away quickly , but it did freak me out  --  and it taught me that I could n't work long hours anymore . In the meantime , all three friends were hoping for good news from Jody . " We were so excited when she went in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could finally be pregnant , after all this time and so much disappointment , " says Jenny . " And I had a good feeling about it . Of course , we knew that there was a chance it would n't work out , but IVF with ICSI has a higher success rate than other fertility treatment alternatives , and I was really crossing my fingers that this would be it . " Although her doctor had told her not to drive herself crazy taking home pregnancy tests following the egg transfer , Jody did n't listen . " Jenny was my enabler , " she says . " She encouraged me to go ahead and test . " In the online community , women trying to conceive refer to taking home pregnancy tests and the tests that monitor your ovulation as " POAS , " which stands for " peeing on a stick . " Jenny , a stay-at-home mom who had struggled to get pregnant with both the son she lost and her baby girl , Nora , had charted her ovulation and fertility since shortly after getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ins and outs of following the hormonal surges of ovulation and possible pregnancy . " I 'm a POAS pusher , " Jenny admits , laughing . Jody : A couple of days after the transfer , I tested to make sure the hormones from the trigger shot were out of my system ; if they 're still in you , the test comes up positive automatically . It was negative , and I thought , Good ! But I was still feeling really down . I did n't have any symptoms and I was sure the IVF had n't worked . Then I took a home pregnancy test , and it was positive . I tested again the next day , and it was positive again . So I called the doctor and asked , " Do you want me to have a beta hCG test to see if my pregnancy hormone levels are rising ? " Also , since I have a blood-clotting disorder called Factor V Leiden  --  which might have been the reason I had a miscarriage  --  I 'll have to take drugs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should start on medication early . They said , " Quit testing ! It 's a waste of your money , and you 'll find out anyway . " But of course , I did n't quit . I was peeing on a stick every day . By the end , the " positive " line was appearing so fast that I knew I was pregnant ! Her doctor 's appointment , when it finally rolled around on January 19 , confirmed the long-awaited good news : Jody was pregnant ! She began taking Lovenox  --  an anticlotting drug  --  right away , and follow-up blood tests confirmed that her hormone levels were rising just as they should be in early pregnancy . Two weeks later , an ultrasound gave Jody and Scott , 32 , the first glimpse of their developing baby . Jody : The baby was the size of a grain of rice , but we could already see the heart beating ! It was such a relief to us . A lot of my fears were taken away on that day . They say that once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance of anything happening . That 's the day we came up with a nickname for our baby : " Birdie . " After all , we 'd been talking so much about eggs and yolks , and then there the baby was , fluttering away on the ultrasound  --  so it just seemed to fit . Proceeding With Caution Jenny , who had yelped with happiness when Jody called to tell her the big news , was still extra vigilant with her own child , Nora , now a healthy , active 5-month-old who was trying hard to crawl . After the devastating heartbreak of losing Andrew to SIDS , Jenny and her husband , Sean , 37 , had decided to keep baby Nora on an apnea monitor . The device consists of a stretchy band worn around Nora 's chest and is connected with wires to an alarm system ; the monitor would beep if the baby 's breathing stopped or if her heart rate got too low . At first , Nora wore it most of the time , then Jenny slowly weaned the baby  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wearing it only at night . Jenny : The doctor was fine with us using the monitor until Nora 's 9-month well-baby visit  --  actually , she 'll be over 10 months by the time we go in . She said that the second peak time for SIDS is at 8 months , and that 's why she did n't mind if we kept using it , provided that Nora is n't getting tangled in the cords . That was a relief . I was really dreading taking her off it . Like , petrified . Maybe that 's why she does n't take good naps  --  could it be the mama bear hovering over her and poking her if I ca n't see her breathing ? Photograph : JENNY After losing her son , she 's watchful with baby Nora , who wears a breathing monitor at night . Jenny was also beginning to think about her next child . Because of her struggles to get pregnant with both Andrew and Nora , she knew it might not be easy . " We 're going to have at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependent on Nora . For me to go back on the fertility drug Clomid , she has to be weaned , and I 'm not going to wean her automatically at a year , " she says . But she has reason to be optimistic : Since Nora was born , Jenny 's periods have returned in a fairly normal cycle . " I 've always had irregular periods , and I 'm not used to them just coming on their own , " Jenny explains . " I 'm not charting , so I do n't know if I 'm ovulating , but right now we 're just not preventing . If anything happens , we 'd have a happy , unexpected accident ! " " She 's so worth it " As February came to a close , Carrie watched her due date arrive  --  and pass . Nearly all the other women in her online " birth club " of mothers due in February had already delivered their babies , but on March 1 , she was still waiting . " I was feeling okay , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I was just so ready to be done ! " Finally , in the wee hours of the morning of March 2 , Carrie 's water broke . Carrie : When John and I arrived at the hospital , things moved fast  --  I went from 2 centimeters dilated when I checked in to 7 centimeters an hour and a half later , when they gave me the epidural . Since the baby was in the posterior position , it was all back labor , which is n't fun ! The epidural seemed to slow things down and I did n't fully dilate for another five hours . Around 7 p.m. , I started pushing . But the baby had n't descended yet , so pushing really slowed the heartbeat . They waited an hour for the heart rate to stabilize , and at 8 p.m. , we tried pushing again . At 9:10 p.m. , Payton Elizabeth was born ! She was 9 lbs , 7 oz  --  the doctor laughed at me because my first comment was , " She 's so tiny ! " I guess not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but overjoyed to be a mom . Carrie had thought the labor was n't all that difficult , but she was about to get some bad news . Payton 's faceup position during delivery , combined with her size and the fact that Carrie overextended her hips while pushing , led to something called pubic symphysis separation . During a normal labor , the ligaments that hold the pubic bones together stretch and then return to their normal position . But Carrie 's ligaments stretched so far to allow Payton to come out that they were damaged , and there was a 2-centimeter gap between the bones . " What it means is that I could n't really walk at all initially , " Carrie says . " When I first got out of bed , it was really freaky  --  I was telling my legs to move , and they would n't . The doctors thought it was just a side effect of the epidural , but the pain radiating through my pelvis was n't normal . " If physical therapy could n't help , Carrie was told , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overjoyed with her new daughter , but frustrated that the labor injury forced her to use a walker  --  and for a while , left her unable to pick up and carry Payton . " I could hold her , but I could n't carry her , " she says . " I feel so bad for Carrie , " says Jenny . " You expect to be able to enjoy and bond with your baby and not have to worry about something like this . You have an image of what it 's going to be like  --  walking around pushing the stroller , and all that . I know she 's enjoying her daughter so much , but it 's not fair that she has to miss out on some of the things you want to do in the first few weeks . " Fortunately , as the new family settled in , Carrie began physical therapy , and the exercises seemed to be making an improvement . " By the time Payton was about 12 days old , I could pick her up and carry her , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house still tires me out , but every day I can do a little more , walk a little farther . " And every day , she is falling more in love with her beautiful daughter . Carrie : You see her for the first time and she 's just like a little angel . I spend hours staring at her . Of course , I did n't expect to have all of the issues afterward , especially since my pregnancy had gone so smoothly . But still , even with all of that , I would not trade this for anything . She 's so worth it . Should you freeze your eggs ? It seems like a promise of perpetual fertility : Freeze your eggs now , and if by your late 30s you have n't found Mr. Right or you want to achieve career goals before having a child , you do n't have to worry about your biological clock running out . Unfortunately , it 's not a promise you can count on . The American Society for Reproductive Medicine still regards frozen eggs as experimental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ births have resulted from them worldwide . The reason : Unlike sperm , eggs do n't freeze well  --  ice crystals easily damage their chromosomal structure . " The success rates are so low that you 're actually better off waiting until your 40s and doing IVF , " says reproductive endocrinologist Glenn Schattman , M.D. , of New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Medical College of Cornell University . Freezing eggs also involves a time-consuming process that can require several rounds of fertility drugs and egg harvesting . Plus , it 's costly  --  $12,000 to $15,000 for egg extraction , and more than $8,000 total for egg storage and thawing.  --  Meg Lundstrom What to expect during IVF Step by step , here 's what you 'll typically experience while trying to conceive a child with in vitro fertilization : 1 . The intake interview . If initial fertility treatments such as fertility drugs or surgery fail and you decide to move forward with IVF , your ob/gyn will refer you to a reproductive endocrinologist . During your initial meeting with the doctor , you 'll discuss your medical and fertility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which treatment protocols will work best for you , as well as what you can do to improve the odds of a healthy birth . 2 . Preliminary tests and talks . You 'll undergo ultrasound and blood tests to determine the number and quality of your eggs . You 'll also meet with a nurse to learn how to self-administer fertility drugs , a financial counselor to work out payment , and a psychologist to discuss coping with any stress that might arise . 3 . Drugs to induce egg growth . To stimulate your follicles to grow as many eggs as possible during your cycle , for about two weeks you 'll give yourself one to three daily injections of fertility medications ( such as Gonal-F , a follicle-stimulating hormone , and Repronex , a luteinizing hormone ) in your thigh or stomach . Either before your cycle or midway through , you 'll also inject a gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH ) drug such as Lupron , which prevents you from ovulating too early . Around day 12 , you 'll inject the drug human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of egg growth . During these two weeks , you 'll visit the clinic about five times for blood and ultrasound tests to monitor your progress . 4 . Egg harvesting . In a carefully targeted window of time  --  shortly before doctors calculate that your eggs will be released through the fallopian tubes during ovulation  --  you 'll be heavily sedated and , using ultrasound as a guide , your doctor will pull eggs out of your ovaries with a hollow needle inserted through the wall of the vagina . In the meantime , your partner , in a nearby room , will ejaculate into a cup to obtain sperm , which the lab will then quickly process to extract the most robust ones . The sperm and eggs are then mixed together in an incubator so insemination can occur . If necessary  --  for instance , when sperm count is low or the sperm are having difficulty penetrating the egg  --  the lab embryologist might also perform intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( ICSI ) , a procedure in which sperm are injected directly into an egg . If you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might also puncture the outer shell of a resulting embryo shortly before transferring it into the uterus so it can implant itself more easily , a process called assisted hatching . 5 . Embryo transfer . Three days after harvesting your eggs , your doctor will use a thin catheter to insert two or three embryos into your uterus via the vagina . " This is a painless procedure that feels like a Pap smear , " explains Mark Perloe , M.D. , medical director at Georgia Reproductive Specialists in Atlanta . If genetic diseases are a concern , this step might occur on day five , after lab biopsies have been performed to select the healthiest embryos . 6 . The outcome . Your partner ( or a friend or a family member ) will give you daily injections of progesterone , a hormone that aids implantation , in the buttocks . In two weeks , you 'll take a pregnancy test at the clinic ; someone there will call to give you the results .  --  Meg Lundstrom Look for the next installment of The Fertility Diaries in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
