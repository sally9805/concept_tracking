Section : PREVENTION , MITIGATION AND PREPAREDNESS <p> A chronic problem in the management of volcanic emergencies is the collective struggles and conflicts among the parties involved , many of which are beset with faulty public policies . Examples abound in the literature associated with this field , including the Taal volcano in the Philippines and the emergency management challenges that occurred with the eruptions of Soufriere ( 1976 ) and Soufriere ( 1979 ) volcanoes in Guadalupe and St. Vincent islands , respectively . All of these cases demonstrate the potential that conflicting scientific views can have in shaping emergency responses , and their ability to influence public policies that overlook critical risks faced by the populations most threatened by volcanic eruptions. ( n1 ) <p> The organizational arrangements and decisionmaking schemes used in managing volcanic emergencies received a good deal of attention after the Armero disaster in Colombia produced by the Nevado del Ruiz Volcano in 1985 . This eruption formed an enormous lahar ( debris flow ) that buried most of the population of the town of Armero , killing 20,000 to 24,000 people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst such disaster on record. ( n2 ) One of the consequences of the Armero disaster was the creation of the U.S.-based Volcano Disaster Assistance Program ( VDAP ) , an interagency cooperative program that attempts to " reduce eruption-caused fatalities and economic losses in developing countries . " ( n3 ) Another outcome , which garnered strong support from the United States Geological Survey ( USGS ) , was the adoption of organizational measures recommended by the Volcanic Emergency Management Manual of the United Nations Disaster Relief Organization ( UNDRO ) . ( n4 ) <p> Many countries in Latin America and elsewhere adopted the resulting UNDRO-USGS management scheme . It assumes that people are aware of volcanic hazards and wish to protect their communities ; that laws exist at the local , regional and national levels that would make it possible to create and carry out protective measures ; that there is ample scientific knowledge to construct alternative scenarios of the eruptions and their destructive effects ; that it will be possible to disseminate warnings with sufficient lead time for people to take protective action ; and that an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ includes the following social actors : <p> ? A group of scientists in charge of monitoring the volcano who issue forecasts to appropriate authorities about the probability and nature of the risks of volcanic activity . They would not intervene in the activities of civil authorities in charge of protecting the population . <p> ? An emergency management committee that includes public officials and representatives from other community organizations , which interprets and uses the scientific knowledge for the population 's protection . <p> ? An effective mass communication system that disseminates the decisions of the emergency management system and provides people with information about the volcanic threat and the recommended protective actions . <p> The UNDRO-USGS scheme assumes that a variety of technical resources as well as preparedness and response programs for the authorities and threatened population are already in place. ( n5 ) The scheme does not consider the cultural and social complexities linked to emergency response in the developing world ; rather , it primarily examines the risk of volcanic eruption from a natural science perspective. ( n6 ) The risks associated with the decision to evacuate or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manual is suitable for actors that have a high level of technical proficiency , it is less optimal for volcanic emergencies that affect communities and regions where such expertise is lacking . At times , this deficit can be as basic as having no system of public warnings. ( n7 ) <p> In the analysis that follows , we examine the emergency management program involving population evacuation and resettlement that has been used in volcanic risk situations on five volcanoes in three developing societies : Chichonal , Popocatpetl and Volcan de Fuego , in Mexico ; Tungurahua in Ecuador ; and San Cristobal in Nicaragua . The responses to these incidents shed light on the efficacy of the organizational measures recommended by the Volcanic Emergency Management Manual of UNDRO . We offer a critical assessment of these policy frameworks and analyze the political contexts of disaster relief , while illustrating the roles that disaster refugees and indigenous peoples are subjected to in such cases . The paper concludes by characterizing the difficulties faced by the UNDRO approach as examples of the difficulties that are often associated with international technology transfers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volcano in Mexico in 1982 was a catastrophic antecedent to the UNDRO-USGS management system . The Chichonal volcano is situated about 70 kilometers from Tuxtla Gutierrez , the capital city of Chiapas . Its eruption on 28 March and again on 3-4 April killed at least five thousand people , mostly from the Zoque ethnic community. ( n8 ) There was no monitoring equipment on site with the exception of a set of seismographs that had been installed by the federal electricity commission , or Comisin Federal de Electricidad ( CFE ) , for the monitoring of seismic activity around nearby dams . Overall , the debacle revealed a deplorable state of neglect in Mexico 's emergency response and preparedness . <p> The Mexican Army was the primary federal agency in charge of responding to this disaster . It arrived on the scene on 1 April , two days prior to the deadly eruption of the 3rd . Due to a certain degree of poor coordination between the army and local communities , evacuation efforts did not begin until after the second eruption . Perhaps some blame can be directed toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , named DN-III-E , on the suggestion of a CFE geologist with no experience in either volcanoes or disaster relief , who opined that the eruption had ceased on 1 April. ( n9 ) Following this advice , the authorities used the mass media and other means to convince the Zoque ethnic communities to stay in their homes. ( n10 ) Two days later , the second massive eruption took place , killing the majority of the victims . Afterwards , as the army evacuated the survivors , they segregated them by gender and age , disrupting family networks. ( n11 ) Eventually close to 45,000 people evacuated to thirty-seven shelters in seventeen cities that were far from the volcano and from their homes. ( n12 ) Not much is known about the survivors . Between 1995 and 1997 , as part of a research program of the Department of Anthropology of the Autonomous Metropolitan University-Iztapalapa Campus , Ignacio Zavala researched the forced population evacuation linked to the eruption of the Chichonal volcano . His study considered the symbolic-religious interpretations of the volcano as well as the effects of the management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of families who became environmental refugees and were forced to improvise their own community and civil structures . They did so without external or government assistance , much less compensation for their losses , which aggravated their poverty. ( n14 ) POPOCATPETL VOLCANO <p> The Popocatpetl volcano , 45 miles southeast of Mexico City and 30 miles southwest of the city of Puebla , currently threatens more than 20 million people . It is one of the most active volcanoes in Mexico , with 15 eruptions since the arrival of the Spaniards in Mexico , although most eruptions have been mild . It became active a few days before Christmas in 1994 . The eruption occurred days after a profound national economic crisis resulting from the devaluation of the Mexican peso and that required the financial assistance of the United States . With the Chichonal and Nevado del Ruiz volcanic eruptions as a backdrop , Mexican officials adopted the UNDRO-USGS model to address the dangers posed by the Popocatpetl volcano . The scientific committee for the Popocatpetl volcano was thus created in 1995 as part of the response to the eruptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputable geologists in the country . Moreover , the National System of Civil Protection , or Sistema Nacional de Proteccin Civil ( SINAPROC ) , through the initiative of the then-director of the National Center for the Prevention of Disasters , or Centro de Prevencin de Desastres ( CENAPRED ) , created a national committee to give comprehensive technical assistance regarding the Popocatpetl volcano and other volcanoes and hazards . <p> The SINAPROC national committee incorporated the committee to assess the Popocatpetl volcano as well as other committees on geologic , hydro-meteorological , chemical and public health hazards , and a subcommittee composed of social scientists. ( n15 ) This national body includes a number of seismologists and has a membership of approximately twenty-two geoscientists that participate actively in its meetings . <p> SINAPROC , as the agency of the Mexican federal government that attends to disasters , is similar in function to the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) in the United States . SINAPROC was created in 1986 in the aftermath of the earthquake of 1985 that impacted Mexico City ; until then , despite the Chichonal disaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an agency . Thus , when the Popocatpetl volcano erupted in 1994-1995 , SINAPROC was able to respond to the crisis . Initially , SINAPROC did not plan to include a group of scientists in its activities , but this decision was reversed by the then-director of CENAPRED in order to assist in the handling of emergencies and prevention of disasters . It was in this context that the UNDRO-USGS model was adopted , first for volcanic emergencies but soon after for all types of emergencies . <p> The eruption of the Popocatpetl volcano in December 1994 brought about an ineffective mass evacuation of threatened populations from the adjacent regions . Initially , the government 's objective was to evacuate approximately 75,000 people from sixteen communities near the volcano 's crater . However , only about 26,000 people were evacuated . The most evacuees remained in public shelters for several days before returning to their communities which were in the midst of social conflicts between the authorities and community members opposing evacuation orders. ( n16 ) <p> As it turned out , the mass evacuation order was a false alarm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volcano closely followed UNDRO-USGS recommendations and advised public officials based on their interpretations of volcanic monitoring data using a four-color code system ( white or green for normal , yellow for possible occurrence and preliminary precautions , orange for high probability of an eruption and red for actual eruption ) to warn the population. ( n17 ) The so-called semaforo de alerta volcanica ( traffic light for volcanic warnings ) , despite claims to the contrary , does not constitute the integrated warning system that is needed , because it violates the principles that make warning messages effective and does not include the creation of the organizations and procedures that are required for effective disaster planning. ( n18 ) Their approach to the emergency ignored other ways in which the population at risk conceptualized the Popocatpetl volcano as not only a threat but also a giver of life . Moreover , it did not include the communities ' religious figures , known as tiemperos , who are believed to act as conduits between the communities and the volcano and are said to interpret its feelings and wishes . It also ignored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that corresponds to religious practices that syncretize Catholic beliefs with the pre-Hispanic " Tlaloc God " cult. ( n19 ) It is important to underscore that this collective perception of the Popocatpetl volcano as a beneficent force is partly based on common sense and experience , for until the eruption of 1994-1995 it never posed a threat . This neglect of local customs had the unfortunate consequence of pitting scientists and government officials against traditional institutions . After all , an effective disaster plan requires sensitivity to cultural factors , particularly over what is deemed an appropriate response . Ideally , a sense of the cosmovisin of people exposed to hazards should inform disaster-related policies so that traditional perspectives complement those that reflect modern ontological and epistemological systems of thought. ( n20 ) <p> In June 1997 , there was another eruption in Popocatpetl , which sent ashes to parts of Mexico City . All of the elements of the disorganized response system previously discussed occurred again . Thus , while the governor of Puebla state heeded SINAPROC 's evacuation orders , the governors of Morelos and the state of Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that merited initial preparations . The failure of the warning system was shown by the confusion between those who gave the warnings and those who were supposed to implement the responses . The responses diverged at the federal and state levels , with one governor adopting a significantly divergent set of measures . In the state of Puebla there were three different color schemes with different sets of meanings attached to them . There also existed two different color systems : one to convey information among state and federal officials , and the other to convey information to the public . <p> The June 1997 eruption was less intense than the eruptions in December 1994 or those in November 1997 , 1998 and 2000 . Nevertheless , it was important because it caused a great deal of alarm in the city and illustrated that the color-coded national warning system and the inter-organizational and inter-ministerial response mechanisms did not function as hoped despite the presence of a full-fledged scientific committee . Additionally , it revealed areas in which the federal and state bureaucracies lacked an effective interagency relief strategy and disaster prevention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two public initiatives were launched in the state of Puebla to improve what was perceived by many as a defective federal and state response system . One was the creation of a Preparedness and Response Plan for the Popocatpetl Volcano ( PPEVP ) , which was to be the key instrument in organizing an operational emergency plan . PPEVP included tactics and procedures to guide the response to a situation of emergency in the region , as well as a set of long-term guidelines to gradually increase the region 's resilience in the aftermath of such disasters . The second scheme examined the concept of an alternative public warning system that would substitute for the color-coded alert system mentioned earlier . Russell Dynes 's ideas regarding the ways to establish a community emergency preparedness planning function guided these efforts . Dynes , a world-renowned social scientist who has studied community disaster planning for many years , emphasizes that emergencies and disasters often create a degree of confusion and disorganization that falls short of chaos and does not reduce the capacity of people to react appropriately He argues that the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the demands and problems created by the disaster . Since the creation of new organizations is neither possible nor effective , existing institutions , groups and other social units in the community should be relied on to make the correct decisions and to take appropriate actions . Finally , Dynes argues that decisions during disasters are most often made in a decentralized fashion by a plurality of social actors , rendering a centralized command and control approach less effective. ( n21 ) <p> The PPEVP took a dual approach to disaster preparedness . It incorporated Dynes ' ideas into the established civil protection plan , which used a military command and control approach that made the army the leading agency in the federal response , while attempting to identify and make use of complementarities in the two approaches . It emphasized the value of non-governmental organizations in undertaking public services in the aftermath of disasters , and following Dynes , it advocated for the development of resources for the communities at risk using civil organizations that were already in place . The implementation of PPEVP , however , fell short of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Operational Plan of Popocatpetl ( POP ) had advanced , but contrary to initial PPEVP directives , the development and strengthening of local institutions that respond to emergencies  --  particularly in carrying out massive evacuations  --  had not taken place . Instead , with the assistance of CUPREDER ( Centro Universitario de Prevencin de Desastres Regionales de la Universidad Autonoma de Puebla ) , a research center in Puebla , state personnel claimed to have created approximately thirty units of civil defense in the communities at risk . However , these officials could not provide information to Dr. Macas on the location of these centers , the level of the personnel 's technical proficiency , or other organizational arrangements in the program . Moreover , the system lacked a public education program , general information on regional and community level disaster plans and information on what people should do in the event of an imminent eruption . In many instances , the system appeared to exist merely on paper . <p> The plan 's implementation thus became another exercise in the old style of Mexican state politics , reflecting a practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( PRI ) , a political party that held hegemonic power in Mexico for more than seven decades , until the presidential elections of 2000 . During this period , elections only simulated the workings of democracy and there was widespread corruption , electoral fraud , voter suppression and violence . In the plan , through work on the ground and on paper , members of the communities would appear as if they were performing disaster-related duties , when in fact they were unable or unwilling to do so . POP in effect became a simulated disaster plan , which created a sense of false security while it stoked general distrust of government officials who were charged with enhancing the safety of communities in the region threatened by Popocatpetl . In this particular case , the members of PRI , enacting the political culture of their party , arranged that some members of the communities would agree to participate in the development of emergency plans , in effect simulating community participation that did not actually take place . <p> It may be that the POP framework did more harm than good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be real , which is in reality dysfunctional , is much worse than having no plan at all . Importantly , while the lack of confidence in governmental authorities was seldom openly expressed during this incident , it is nevertheless our opinion , based on knowledge of local culture and practice , that the activities of state personnel involved in POP diminished popular confidence and created in many a sense of false security This was the case even among some of the government employees , who thought that future volcanic emergencies would be resolved satisfactorily , according to the plan . <p> The most recent crisis of the Popocatpetl volcano occurred in December 2000 . Alejandra Lopez has written a comprehensive review of the various efforts that had taken place during the preceding years and during this crisis. ( n22 ) She concludes that this scenario showed once again that none of the various disaster-related government programs had minimized the risk of the populations residing near the volcano . To summarize what was a complex sequence of events , in early December 2000 the geoscientific committee associated with CENAPRED declared that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level yellow , phase 3 . This meant that people at risk had to commence evacuation preparations . However , the director of the federal civil defense agency on or around 15 December ordered an immediate evacuation of the communities near the volcano , which affected approximately 35,000 people . For reasons unknown , the tiemperos resisted it , denying that the volcano would endanger the lives and property of the surrounding residents . A great deal of confusion resulted , with many refusing to evacuate . What finally prompted a nearcomplete evacuation was an elaborate hoax by the mass media that did not receive much international attention : On the night of 18 December , mobile TV cameras from a national television station , TV Azteca , documented an eruption of the Popocatpetl volcano and magnified it through visual means to " prove " the imminence of danger . Afterwards , other news media outlets became involved in the events . Among them was another national television station , Televisa , which also helped generate the mass fear , in what Lopez characterized as a " media creation . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event that people began evacuating , and by the afternoon and evening of the 19th , every community near the crater had evacuated . <p> Although little was covered by the news , the refugees arrived at public shelters to find that , despite repeated claims to the contrary , the local , state and federal officials were unprepared ; there was no food or other necessities . The experience further evoked the perception that disaster planning in Mexico was of a simulated nature . It is noteworthy that in this instance , tens of thousands of people in the various communities near the volcano evacuated in an orderly and effective manner despite the near absence of state disaster preparedness programs or assistance . As it turned out , the Popocatpetl volcano erupted from the 19th to the 21st . The eruption and the evacuation received massive media coverage , while at the local , state and federal governmental levels , the incident was interpreted as a validation of government efficiency and preparedness . Interestingly , the director of the federal agency CENAPRED then prognosticated yet another massive volcanic eruption for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who assured the communities that " Gregorio " ( the local name of the Popocatpetl volcano ) " would not do anything , " at which time the evacuees went back to their communities . Fortunately , the eruptions subsided and the crisis ended . <p> The above events exemplify local communities ' propensity to react effectively to volcanic crises without much if any public assistance or resources . At all levels of government , disaster preparedness plans did not work as intended . In the case of Puebla , the largest city near the Popocatpetl volcano , the POP was a simulated disaster preparedness program . Since the massive evacuation of December 2000 , there have been no important observable changes in the behavior of the Popocatpetl volcano . Nevertheless , the region around it has continued on code yellow for most of the last ten years , despite attempts by the national government to lower it . To resolve the inconsistency , in 2004 the authorities created sublevels within the color levels green and yellow . In this way they officially lowered the level of the threat even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire system. ( n24 ) FUEGO DE COLIMA VOLCANO <p> Colima Volcano , also called the Volcn de Fuego de Colima , is the most active volcano in Mexico , with more than forty eruptions since the 16th century . It is located in the state of Jalisco , near the border with the state of Colima , about 300 miles west of Mexico City and 75 miles south of Guadalajara . Mexican government officials applied a similar formula to it during the incidents in 1998 . Here again , the local population was subject to repeated false alarms and forced evacuations in 1998 , and again in 1999 and 2000. ( n25 ) In the first instance , the governor of Colima , together with the local university , used the UNDRO-USGS model to form a Science and Technical Committee of the Colima Volcano ( Comite Tecnico Cientifico del Volcn de Colima ) , which acted with the support of the state 's civil protection office . As in other cases , natural scientists monitored the volcano and communicated this information to public officials and the interagency commission that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went beyond its function , for example , by stating its opinion that the people in the shelters should stay in them despite widespread popular opposition , to the point that in a number of instances government officials declared publicly that they would do whatever the scientists recommended. ( n26 ) <p> This scientific committee also became involved in a number of other matters beyond the expertise of its members , such as recommending the resettlement of communities that were vulnerable to volcano eruptions . This has been the case in part because public officials in charge of making these decisions have not fulfilled their roles as managers of emergencies in their communities . The officials disregarded certain social and cultural features of the communities near the volcano , such as their religious beliefs and institutions , and have not considered the ways in which relevant technical information may impact community preparedness and emergency response . Additionally , they have employed an authoritarian style in which the population is expected to obey their orders . The consequence is that they have not created the emergency management network of community organizations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not tended to the necessary public education and conscience-raising matters with businesses , religious institutions and other key sectors that would have allowed them to mobilize their communities in times of crises , nor have they engaged them in collective deliberations about whether evacuation or resettlement would be needed , and if so , how best to achieve it . In the resulting vacuum , these natural scientists have been free to opine on a number of matters that go well beyond their purview , such as recommending types of population resettlements without considering the attending complexities such as those that have been studied by Anthony Oliver-Smith. ( n27 ) <p> In 2001 , the scientific committee recommended that the Colima state government resettle its communities near the volcano . Two communities were impacted : La Yerbabuena and Juan Barragn , 7 and 11 kilometers from the crater , respectively . There were mixed results when the state attempted to implement this measure . One portion of the population moved , while about 20 percent remained in their original homes. ( n28 ) Quickly , the situation degenerated into a political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement to resist the government and have attracted support from a number of sympathizers within and outside the state , among them the Zapatista National Liberation Front ( Frente Zapatista de Liberacin Nacional ) . There is currently a considerable lack of faith in state authorities ; some claim that government officials had planned the resettlement of the community of La Yerbabuena as far back as 1998 and were now using the scientific advisory committee 's recommendations to satisfy an ulterior motive to develop the land into an exclusive residential area and tourist attraction. ( n29 ) Other studies that employed sophisticated cartographic and geographic technology concluded that La Yerbabuena was outside the risk of lahars and volcanic projectiles  --  some of the hazards that had been used to justify resettlement measures. ( n30 ) This ongoing conflict involved significant constitutional violations of the rights of citizens in La Yerbabuena . The state government has since reacted by refusing public services , such as public education for the children of political dissidents . Furthermore , the resistors have to endure the presence of a nearby military detachment  --  mandated with keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harassing and abusing women in the community. ( n31 ) <p> This popular opposition is elucidated by the ongoing research of Dr. Macas and his colleagues from the Center for Research and Higher Studies on Social Anthropology , or Centro de Investigaciones y Estudios Superiores en Antropologia Social ( CIESAS ) , on resettlement attempts in Mexico in the aftermath of disasters that include the La Yerbabuena case and the floods in Chiapas in 1998 and those of Veracruz , Puebla and Tabasco in 1999. ( n32 ) The financial program used by the Mexican government to resettle communities in these scenarios is Funding for Natural Disasters ( FONDEN ) . It mandates building houses that are very often too small , have poor ventilation , are made with inadequate material and design , are built in close proximity to each other and often violate the customs of the people affected by disasters . Moreover , FONDEN does not include funding for community development projects and other requirements to reestablish community life . TUNGURAHUA VOLCANO IN ECUADOR <p> Another recent example of the difficulties with present day adaptations of the UNDRO-USGS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tungurahua volcano of Ecuador , which last had a major eruption in 1944 . The scientific team that monitored this volcano , which was from the Geoscience Institute of the National Polytechnic School , went into a state of alert and determined that at least three large communities were threatened : Baos de Agua Santa , Pelileo and Penipe. ( n33 ) The Ecuadorian authorities consulted the geoscientists and decided to enact a forced evacuation of approximately 22,000 to 26,000 inhabitants. ( n34 ) <p> As in other towns , Baos de Agua Santa has a historical relationship with the volcano ; since the Spanish Conquest until 1920 there had been only three significant eruptions and none had caused extensive damage to the town ( reportedly several people died in an April 1773 eruption ) . ( n35 ) The forced evacuation of 1999 recommended by the volcanologists was thus widely understood by the people as very unfortunate since the evacuation caused a lot more damage than the volcano had ever caused before . <p> The evacuation was resisted by a number of the inhabitants so that military force had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that many people left crops , farm animals and other property behind , and resented the reported looting that went on afterwards . While some of the evacuees lived in public shelters , the majority ( 80 percent ) found shelter in the homes of relatives . After three months of waiting , the residents of the town , known as Baenos , organized a return to their community , which unfortunately was marked by violence and conflict . At times , the majority of Baenos fought the national army and police that were trying to block their return ; some even kidnapped high military officers to compel them to relent . Furthermore , the reestablishment of their community was slow and fraught with difficulties , as state authorities cut water , electricity , telephone , schools and other public services to Baos in an attempt to re-evacuate the town after the return . The government refused to invest in maintaining the roads and providing other public services on the grounds that the population disregarded the volcanic threat . There has also been a marked decline in tourism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town . They nevertheless stayed , ending what turned out to be a false alarm evacuation , for the volcano never erupted to the extent that the authorities feared . <p> The negative consequences of the violence included injuries , deaths , property damage and further cycles of repression and opposition in this community and elsewhere in Ecuador . In the aftermath of the Tungurahua volcano incident of 1999 , the conflict was so pronounced that , as documented by Leon Vieira 's account of the struggle , the evacuees developed a complex culture of resistance that allowed them to organize against the government 's prohibition on returning to their homes. ( n36 ) A lasting consequence is that the mismanagement of this incident and the culture of opposition it helped create may make people less willing to accept official attempts to protect them against the eruption of the volcano in the future . <p> For some time afterwards , as in Mexico , the management model used in the Tungurahua scenario employed a color system of warnings . It also revealed the willingness of political officials and government bureaucrats to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremendous conflict it generated , particularly in the community of Baos , eventually brought to power a new municipal political administration that made resolving the conflict with the national government its first order of business . The new mayor negotiated with the national authorities a change in the color code that would apply to the city , from orange ( high probability of the occurrence of an eruption ) to yellow ( possible occurrence ) . ( n37 ) This happened even as other towns near the volcano remained in orange , thus creating an illogical situation of different colors for communities in the same region that undermined a unified volcano preparedness approach. ( n38 ) SUMMARY OF THE FOUR CASE STUDIES AND A CRITIQUE <p> In the instances we have reviewed , the risk of volcano eruption and how to prepare for it became a matter of politics . The UNDRO-USGS management scheme in practice allows the scientific interpretation of volcanic activity to determine both the risks associated with the volcano as well as what to do about them . However , from the very inception of the UNDRO-USGS program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not received a great deal of attention . This was aggravated by the faulty application of the program in the cases we have examined . We have shown that the technical outcomes produced by the UNDRO-USGS model are not understood as they should be , as an important factor among a number of other factors creating different sets of social risks for various segments of the population . Public policy makers and emergency management personnel must take these other risks , such as loss of income and of networks of social relations , into consideration. ( n39 ) <p> By way of summary , with the exception of the San Cristobal volcano in Nicaragua that will be examined next , the volcanic crises studied in Mexico ( the Chichonal , Popocatpetl and Colima volcanoes ) and Ecuador ( Tungurahua ) , have these aspects in common : <p> ? Technical monitoring of volcanoes , which is poor but improving , by a scientific team formed according to USGS and UNDRO 's Volcanic Emergency Handling Manual ; <p> ? Recommendations issued by a scientific team that resulted in false alarms ; <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limitations : a scarce level of information in most cases derived from relatively short-term volcano monitoring , and insufficient knowledge of the social , economic and political consequences of population evacuation ; <p> ? Ambiguous mitigation efforts to control volcanic risks together with a lack of incentives for threatened communities to control their demographic growth , land use , road maintenance and other infrastructure ; <p> ? The elaboration of a color-code system that defines various levels of threat , but that does not incorporate a social science understanding either of the nature of effective warning messages or the elements of integrated warning systems ( see below ) ; <p> ? Poor or non-existing emergency management organizations ; and <p> ? Local decisionmakers who are untrained and lack educational and technical skills in emergency management that would allow them to evaluate the recommendations of geoscientists and incorporate them into more holistic approaches to emergency management . <p> In three of the cases ( Popocatpetl , Colima and Tungurahua ) , mass evacuations occurred under " false alarm " contexts in which eruptions did not occur . These evacuations came at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the Popocatpetl incidents there were two evacuation attempts ( December 1994 and December 2000 ) that created adverse reactions within the community . In the event that evacuations are required in the future , this constitutes an extremely dangerous situation in which people may resist evacuation orders despite imminent threats . <p> In the Colima Volcano case , the repeated evacuations resulted in the failed attempt to relocate La Yerbabuena , a community deemed at risk . The relocation did not go well , and the new housing developments resulted in escalating conflict that has divided the community . The situation has degenerated into an embarrassing political conflict pitting the state government against the community in a struggle over civil rights violations . It has also led to controversies within the scientific community , wherein some geoscientists have challenged the earlier estimates that certain communities were at risk of the eruptions . In the Tungurahua case in 1999 , the three-month evacuation generated violence that resulted in the eventual return of the evacuees to the city of Baos de Agua Santa and other nearby communities . It also generated a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the threatened population about how to protect themselves in future volcanic threats . SAN CRISTOBAL VOLCANO , NICARAGUA : NEW WAYS OF PREPARING THE COMMUNITY ? <p> Nicaragua has eleven active volcanoes that , throughout history , have inflicted considerable damage on the country 's population . The San Cristobal volcano is in the region northeast of Managua , and although it does not have a notable history of damaging eruptions , its recent increase in pre-emption activity has made it a source of concern . Its eruptions do not have clear cycles ; its most obvious periods of volcanic eruptions were from 1528 to 1529 , 1682 to 1685 and 1971 to 1976 ; the most recent was from 1993 to 1997 , and five large eruptions have occurred in the last twenty-five years. ( n40 ) In response to the volcano 's pre-emption activities in December 2000 , which continues up to the present , the government issued a yellow alert ( possible occurrence of an eruption ) for the towns of Los Pellizcos , Chichigalpa and Rancherias . This was followed in 2002 with the creation of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , SINAPRED , which could , if studied for its positive features , improve the application of the UNDRO model . <p> In Nicaragua , the UNDRO model has not been established . Instead , the monitoring of volcanoes is the responsibility of the Institute of Territorial Studies ( INETER ) , a government organization . INETER is in charge of determining the various levels of risk and the appropriate color scheme to warn populations . INETER also obtains expert assessments from national and international volcanologists . The national offices of civil defense and the recently-created SINAPRED execute the disaster emergency plans in conjunction with other agencies and organizations . According to the national disaster plan , each threatened community has its own map of risks , public shelter and social organizations responsible for specific actions during the crisis. ( n41 ) It also maintains the previously mentioned system of colors to signify various levels of threat . In the case of a yellow alert , municipal-level emergency committees are activated and convene at least once a day to review changes in the situation and their impact on the communities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicine and humanitarian resources in the aftermath of disasters . Here we see some of Dynes ' above-mentioned ideas in action , representing an approach that should receive financial support , for it has the advantage of allowing potential volcano victims to be responsible for their own protection . CONCLUSION <p> The application of the UNDRO-USGS model for the management of volcanic emergencies has not offered a sound approach to protecting populations threatened by volcanic eruptions , but instead has aggravated the risk that these populations face . A volcanic emergency involves a number of variables beyond the geophysical concerns of volcanoes . These include a multiplicity of social and cultural population categories with respective needs that should be considered in any risk calculation . The fatalities of volcanic disaster are not limited to the eruption alone . They also include poverty , lack of social support , loss of habitat , poor health and nutrition and hopelessness . To manage a volcanic eruption it is necessary to consider these often-contradictory needs , for an evacuation order that is intended to protect people at the same time may destroy their ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is because many of these complexities are social that the geoscientists should focus more on the diagnosis and prognosis of a volcano 's behavior and less on actions that have direct social impacts . Such actions are the sphere of elected officials and well-trained emergency management personnel who should work in close cooperation with the institutions and organizations of the communities facing the threat . Thus , a critical need is the development of these skills among these categories of public servants in the developing world to help them create more effective volcano preparedness and response programs and more accurate cost-risk analyses . <p> The difficulties faced by the emergency management programs in Mexico and Ecuador that are based on UNDRO 's Volcanic Emergency Handling Manual , can be understood from the perspective of the social science of technology transfers . Literature on this subject  --  encompassing the fields of public policy , planning , agriculture , anthropology and sociology  --  documents the importance of the social , political , economic and cultural assumptions , which though they often go unexamined are key to an effective international transfer of scientific information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social and cultural assumptions are not met. ( n42 ) These include , first , the extent to which particular technologies require changing important aspects of the host society . In the present cases , the technology affects the host community in very dramatic ways and renders the transfer of technology more difficult . This is aggravated by the fact that the science of volcano prediction is quite limited in its knowledge of the potential severity of volcanic activity and its cessation . A successful technology transfer requires close attention to community livelihoods , particularly the economic , familial , social and cultural subsystems . Second is the nature of the bureaucracy managing the technology : In the cases previously presented , the political and emergency management systems were defective ; officials did not have the adequate training and did not perform appropriately Until now , the need to improve these elements has been implicit , and it is an understudied aspect of the UNDRO system . For example , the UNDRO model introduces the color scheme and presupposes that scientific information will form the basis for warning populations under volcanic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to include an appropriate content , be frequently reviewed , come from reliable sources , and clearly establish the risk and what could happen to people in specific locations and times , so that the warning can answer the questions of who will and will not be affected by the hazard and at which level of effect . Unfortunately , the color scheme does not sufficiently accomplish this . <p> Warning messages such as those produced by the color scheme are not warning systems , which should include the organizations that detect the risk , produce the message , and relay this information to entities that are responsible for making operational decisions and communicating with threatened populations. ( n43 ) Such warning systems should include the mass media and other organizations that distribute the information . They should also include the interpretations people make of the information they receive , as well as their reactions to the threat . Areas faced with volcanic threats need to develop integrated warning systems as well as programs that educate their political elites and government officials on how to take appropriate decisions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Perhaps because of these organizational shortcomings , despite the idealized version of the UNDRO scheme in which the scientific and technical specialists creating the warnings do not intervene in local politics , these scientists find themselves involved in local politics and justifying certain policies and lines of actions such as forced evacuations or relocations . The assumption of scientific autonomy and detachment is not appropriate for developing nations . These countries often lack informed public officials and effective disaster management programs . Instead , as we have shown , it has the perverse effect of making people lose trust in their local scientists . <p> Third is the extent and type of local participation in the program . Still to be worked out in the UNDRO scheme is how to facilitate the effective incorporation of local actors into the organization and management of these emergencies . The UNDRO scheme needs to evolve to make disaster mitigation the responsibility of the people of these communities working hand in hand with local emergency management agencies , informed public officials and scientific boards . As Dynes recommended , local participation is an intrinsic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented information on five volcanoes in three developing societies : Chichonal , Popocatpetl and Colima Volcano , in Mexico ; Tungurahua in Ecuador ; and San Cristobal in Nicaragua . With the exception of San Cristobal , a similar volcanic emergency management scheme was implemented in each case and similar consequences have emerged . These stemmed from scientific monitoring and evacuation orders , and the political and social forces that influenced policy-making . As a result , affected communities lost faith in the very institutions that were mandated to protect them . Responding to such emergencies requires a holistic , systemic and sustained effort to improve the resilience of communities and regions exposed to the volcanic hazards that would improve the quality of political leadership , emergency management systems , mass media and public participation with the goal of reducing the impact of volcano eruptions while protecting the sustainability of the communities threatened by them . While not sufficiently recognized , this is the real challenge that the UNDRO-USGS management scheme faces . FOOTNOTES <p>                 @ @ @ @
