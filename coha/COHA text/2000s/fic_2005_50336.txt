I understand women the way junkies understand shooting up . Feel the rush , make the pain go away , and think about the next fix . I do n't know what to do when the glow wears off , when a real person floats to the surface of the dream . It 's the sixties , after all , and what might be pathology in another age has become our historical mandate to fuck . I am not alone in this , although I am extreme . I am not making a case for repentance , merely saying that what I do on the bed , the grass , the table , the back seat , is what makes me forget what 's under the bed , the grass . It 's dark and it smells like rice paddy silt and blood . It waits to catch me between highs-chemical or sexual-and takes me down . <p> Donna would be beautiful if her father had n't broken her nose . She 's beautiful anyhow ; long legs , dirty blond hair , beautiful breasts , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mean streak at all , but I 'm a long way from understanding feminism . Donna is two years older than me , angry at her last lover , and fond of motorcycles . She puts on her leathers and rides sixty miles south to Mexico with her bat nets tied to the rear luggage rack . She goes during the full moon , crosses the border on dirt roads without detection , deep down into Sonora where the bats that live off the cactus fruits swarm and squeak . <p> She spreads the bat nets over the mouth of the cave and waits . Some Yaquis out on the road see this tall woman backlit by the moon and shout Bruja ! Bruja ! , and she touches the .357 magnum she 's stuffed down the front of her Levi 's ; but they walk on , and soon she 's got specimens to bring back , this during a time before La Migra began to stalk the border looking for illegals and it became harder to cross . Bats are her dissertation , and she 's unconsciously developing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long after we 've split . <p> She 's got mood swings that leave me speechless and she fucks like heaven . She 's my older woman , although she 's not much older . She 's got some scars like my scars but I 'm too busy trying to bury mine to see hers . <p> And she 's hard on the heart . She 's got this guy she 's on and off with , a prof in the biology department who 's married , so I never know when we 're going to get together . I 'm working hard to keep the horrors caged and she 's fucking with my emotional flak jacket . She 's got hold of something other than my cock and it 's making me nuts . She 's a jungle . <p> She drinks tequila and has an owl named Hoot perched on top of her refrigerator . When I come over , Hoot does this side-to-side action with his neck that means Try to pet me and I 'll take your finger off . She 's also got snakes . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into an argument because I say that writing is a miserable process , like an oyster making a pearl . She says , " Oysters do n't feel a damn thing . Do n't throw metaphors around like that . " Then we fuck again and I 'm okay . Then I 'm not okay . <p> Donna has a **31;1931;TOOLONG friend named Dana . I complain to Dana about Donna . <p> He says , " You fly with Donna , you take the grief . " It is getting dark . We are getting stoned on his back porch . Drugs do n't feel good anymore . Pot loosens the flak jacket and I float where I do n't want to . I 'm starting to have the dream , the one that will stay with me for years . I 'm naked and I 'm walking through the village of Nui Kim Son . It 's night , and I know the Cong are close . I 'm naked and I have no weapon . I shake myself awake and look out the window . I go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coors . But the shakes do n't subside and memory starts to bleed through into real time . <p> There 's a new guy in the platoon called Paulus who 's got a tattoo of a little red devil on his left shoulder blade . I 've gone with Paulus and Ieter to check out a small ville just east of the desert position . No one 's there but an old man . The other villagers are gone-they always see us coming . The old man has refused to leave . He 's plainly senile . Paulus is enraged . I do n't know whyhe has n't been here long enough for that-but he grabs the old man by his shirt and shoves him down into the family bunker underneath his hooch . He yanks a grenade off his belt and pulls the pin , waits two , then rolls the grenade into the hole . The white flash , the blast of dirt and blood . <p> I shake myself awake and go get another beer . It 's a beautiful night in Tucson but there 's a red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no no . That thing does n't belong there . <p> I 'm in the Student Health Center . The psychiatrist is asking me if I 've had any homosexual feelings . He tells me I have to be realistic about my fantasies . I tell him I 've been in a war . <p> He cocks his head and raises both eyebrows . " Really , " he says . <p> I tell him I 've had LSD on a number of occasions . He says , " You mean that did n't help you ? " I have no idea what he means . Maybe he 's tight with Timothy Leary . I say , " I feel like a reactionary , " by which I mean that I do n't want to take any more drugs , even at the price of seeming unhip ; but he laughs like I said something funny . <p> Then he asks me about my mother . This is another one of those questions they have to ask . My mother is a long way away , physically and psychically . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He picks up the phone . I try to make out what he 's written on his notepad . I can only make out the last line . It says , " Acute Anxiety Reaction . " He puts down the phone and tells me to go to group therapy on Tuesdays at seven . <p> That night Donna comes by . We are naked and she hugs me from behind and takes my cock in both her hands . I do n't think anything can be better . It 's the orgone fix , the rush . The pain is gone and we are fucking . <p> She says , " You ca n't think worth a damn but you 're a serious piece of ass . " She tells me she 's been doing experiments on fruit flies and it 's making her insane . She tells me she wants to kill her lover 's wife . " Simpering little bitch , " she says . " Dresses like Joni Mitchell . Ca n't sing . " Donna can sing . <p> " What are you doing with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind . " <p> I 'm getting depressed , then she reaches between my legs and cups my balls . <p> Next day there 's a huge rally at the university main gate at Park and Third . The police have just got new riot gear and they 're showing it off . Martin Carr , our de facto Maoist movement leader , is there with a bullhorn , dressed in a Mexican wedding shirt . One Two Three Four We Do n't Want Your Fucking War . The police start to move to clear the intersection and Carr calls for us to get out of the way . They 've never seen the cops with riot helmets and batons . They 've never seen tear gas canisters affixed to rifles . This is 1969 . <p> Someone breaks the window of the drugstore at Park Avenue and Third , and the cops charge the crowd . We 've never seen plastic handcuffs . <p> I see David Roma on his face with a cop kneeling on his back . A number of people are staggering and spluttering after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campus Christian center . Don Eckerstrom is there-these are the days before he 's traded in his priest 's collar for a tie-dye T-shirt-and he 's directing the tear-gas victims into the kitchen , where they 're spraying their faces with a dishwashing nozzle . I shout , " Do n't rub your eyes . " Something in the way my voice feels when I shout makes me smell rice paddies . <p> Outside the police have dispersed the demonstrators . There 's a T-shirt lying in the street , a couple of placards with slogans . There 's a pickup truck stopped on Park Ave . driven by a guy with red hair . He 's screaming at the demonstrators . There 's a sticker on the rear window , below the rifle racks , that reads , " University of South Viet Nam , School of Jungle Warfare . " I walk over to him . <p> I say , " Hey , brother . " <p> " Fucking goddamn faggots . Wish I had me a goddamn M-79 . " <p> I say , " What you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What ? " <p> " You 've been fucked , brother . " <p> " How 'd you like your teeth in a doggy bag , asshole . " <p> " Third Battalion First Marines , I-Corps , " I say . <p> He looks at me incredulously . " What ? " <p> " Just like you . We were fucked , brother . " <p> " Shit , " he says , and glares at me . His mouth drops open . He pops the clutch , leaves a long burn around the corner onto Third Street . " Fuck you ! " he shouts . " Fuck you , fuck you , you fuck ... " <p> I love the way Lizzi hangs on to me on the back of the motorcycle . We 've been up to Mount Lemon on the Parilla I 've just bought with my GI Bill check . She 's hanging on to me tight , writhing against me , trembling . I mistake this for love . I think about what we 'll do when we get to her place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts on tea . I put my arms around her and hold her breasts . <p> She says , " I came about five times from the vibration of the bike . Try me later . " <p> I am depressed and out of beer when Donna shows up in her VW and shouts for me to get in . We 're going down near the border . <p> The desert smells sweet from the rain . Tarantulas swarm across the old two-lane highway that heads south into Sonora . Donna stops the car and gets out . Low rumble of thunder over the Chiricahuas . Donna stoops and lets a tarantula crawl onto her hand , a big hairy one with a six-inch leg span . She walks over to me and tells me to open my hand . <p> It 's spring , a year since I came home . <p>
