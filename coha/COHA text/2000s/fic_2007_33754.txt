Chapter One Evan lay on his back in the dark , throwing the baseball up in a straight line and catching it in his bare hands . Thwap . Thwap . The ball made a satisfying sound as it slapped his palm . His legs flopped in a V. His arms stretched up to the ceiling . And the thought that if he missed he 'd probably break his nose made the game just interesting enough to keep going . On the floor above he heard footsteps-his mother's-and then a long , loud scraping-groaning sound . He stopped throwing the ball to listen . His mother was dragging something heavy across the kitchen floor . Probably the broken air conditioner . A week ago , right at the beginning of the heat wave , the air conditioner in his mother 's attic office had broken . The man from Sears had installed a brand-new one but left the old one sitting right in the middle of the kitchen floor . The Treskis had been walking around it all week . Scra-a-a-ape . Evan stood up . His mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hopefully she would n't ask him why he was hiding in the dark basement . And hopefully Jessie would n't be in the kitchen at all . He 'd been avoiding her for two days now , and it was getting harder by the minute . The house just was n't that big . Evan had his hand on the railing when the scraping noisestopped . He heard footsteps fading to silence . She 'd given up . Probably the heat , he thought . It was that kind of weather : giving-up kind of weather . He went back to lying on the floor . Thwap . Thwap . Then he heard the basement door open . Psssshhh . Evan caught the ball and froze . " Evan ? " Jessie 's voice sounded echo-y in the darkness . " Evan ? You down there ? " Evan held his breath . He lay completely still . The only thing that moved was the pins-and-needles prickling in his fingers . He heard the door start to close-long breath out-but then it stopped and opened again . Footsteps on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom step with daylight squirting all around her . Evan did n't move a muscle . " Evan ? Is that you ? " Jessie took one short step into the basement . " Is that ... ? She inched her way toward him , then kicked him with her bare foot . " Hey ! Watch it , would ya ? " said Evan , swatting her leg . He suddenly felt stupid lying there in the dark . " I thought you were a sleeping bag , " she said . " I could n't see . What are you doing down here ? How come the lights are off ? " " It 's too hot with the lights on , " he said . He talked in a flat voice , trying to sound like the most boring person on the whole planet . If he kept it up , Jessie might just leave him alone . " Mom 's back in her office , " said Jessie , lying down on the couch . " Working . " She groaned as she said the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to throwing the ball . Straight up . Straight down . Maybe silence would get Jessie to leave . He was starting to feel words piling up inside him , crowding his lungs , forcing out all the air . It was like having a chestful of bats , beating their wings , fighting to get out . " She tried to move the air conditioner , but it 's too heavy , " said Jessie . Evan tightened up his lips . Go away , he thought . Go away before I say something mean . " It 's gon na be hot a-a-a-all week , " Jessie continued . " In the nineties . All the way up ' til Labor Day . " Thwap . Thwap . " So , whaddya wan na do ? " Jessie asked . Scream , thought Evan . Jessie never got it when you were giving her the Big Freeze . She just went right on acting as if everything were great . It made it really hard to tell her to bug off without telling her to BUG OFF ! Whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whaddya wan na do ? " Jessie asked again , nudging him with her foot . It was a direct question . Evan had to answer it or explain why he would n't . And he could n't get into that . It was too ... too complicated . Too hurtful . " Huh ? So , whaddya wan na do ? " she asked for the third time . " Doin ' it , " said Evan . " Nah , come on . For real . " " For real , " he said . " We could ride our bikes to the 7-Eleven , " she said . " No money , " he said . " You just got ten dollars from Grandma for your birthday . " " Spent it , " said Evan . " On what ? " " Stuff , " Evan said . " Well , I 've got ... well ... " Jessie 's voice dribbled down to nothing . Evan stopped throwing the ball and looked at her . " What ? " Jessie pulled her legs tight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Right , " said Evan . He knew that Jessie had money . Jessie always had money squirreled away in her lock box . But that did n't mean she was going to share it . Evan went back to throwing the baseball . He felt a tiny flame of anger shoot up and lick his face . Thwap . Thwap . " We could build a fort in the woods , " said Jessie . " Too hot . " " We could play Stratego . " " Too boring . " " We could build a track and race marbles . " " Too stupid ! " A thin spider web of sweat draped itself over his forehead , spreading into his hair . With every throw , he told himself , It 's not her fault . But he could feel his anger growing . He started popping his elbow to put a little more juice on the ball . It was flying a good four feet into the air every time . Straight up . Straight down . Pop . Thwap . Pop . Thwap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What is the matter with you ? " asked Jessie . " You 've been so weird the last couple of days . " Aw , man , here they come . " I just do n't wan na play a dumb game like Stratego , " he said . " You like Stratego . I only picked that because it 's your favorite game . I was being nice , in case you had n't noticed . " " Look . There are only six days left of summer , and I 'm not going to waste them playing a dumb game . " Evan felt his heartbeat speed up . Part of him wanted to stuff a sock in his mouth , and part of him wanted to deck his sister . " It 's a stupid game and it 's for babies and I do n't want to play a stupid baby game . " Pop . Thwap . Pop . Thwap . " Why are you being so mean ? " Evan knew he was being mean , and he hated being mean , especially to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so angry and so humiliated and so full of bats , there was nothing else he could be . Except alone . And she 'd taken even that away from him . " You 're the genius , " he said . " You figure it out . " Good . That would shut her up . For once ! Evan watched the ball fly in the air . " Is this because of the letter ? " Jessie asked . Crack . Evan had taken his eyes off the ball for one second , just for one second , and the ball came crashing down on his nose . " Crud ! Oh , CRUD ! " He curled over onto his side , grabbing his nose with both hands . There was a blinding , blooming pain right behind his eyes that was quickly spreading to the outer edges of his skull . " Do you want some ice ? " he heard Jessie ask in a calm voice . " Whaddya think ? " he shouted . " Yeah ? " She stood up . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The pain was starting to go away , like a humungous wave that crashes with a lot of noise and spray but then slowly fizzles away into nothing . Evan rolled to a sitting position and took his hands away from his nose . With his thumb and index finger , he started to pinch the bridge . Was it still in a straight line ? Jessie peered at his face in the dim light . " You 're not bleeding , " she said . " Yeah , well it , hurts ! " he said . " A lot ! " " It 's not broken , " she said . " You do n't know that , " he said . " You do n't know everything , you know . You think you do , but you do n't . " " It 's not even swollen . You 're making a big deal out of nothing . " Evan held his nose with one hand and hit his sister 's knee with the other . Then he picked up the baseball and struggled to his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get away from you and you just had to follow . You ruin everything . You ruined my summer and now you 're going to ruin school . I hate you . " When he got to the bottom of the steps , he threw the baseball down in disgust . Thud . (
