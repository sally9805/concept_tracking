Prologue Momma shrieked . The walls echoed her cries for Daddy to get his hands off her , brought her pleas up the stairs to my room . I jumped and my algebra book dropped from my chestnut desk onto the floor . My father cursed . By the time I made it to the railing and looked down into the living room , Momma was in front of my father , begging for forgiveness . Her petite frame was balled up on our Aztec-patterned sofa . She was holding her lip to keep the blood from flowing onto the fabric . I watched her rub away the pain on her cinnamon skin , then run her fingers through her wavy coal-black hair . My old man looked up at me and grimaced . " Go back to your room , boy . " I was fifteen and a half . Less than half of my old man 's age . He stomped toward Momma . She screamed and moved away from him like she was trying to run away from the madness that lived here every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clock and rushed down the stairs . My heart was pounding . I tightened my hands and hurried to my momma 's side . " Momma , " I moaned as I kneeled next to her . " You okay ? " " I 'm alright , baby . It 's nothing . Nothing . " I looked back at my liquored-up old man . He bobbed his head and pointed back at the kitchen . " I work hard all day and come home to no dinner ? " He was slurring and sneering down on us . I said , " Nobody knew you were coming home tonight . " Momma tried to get up . " I overslept . My pills made me " " Carmen , " he shouted . " Get up off that sofa and cook . Now . Planet of the Apes comeson in an hour and I want my food on the table by the time Charlton Heston " " Do n't ever touch Momma again . " " What you say ? " " He did n't say anything . " Momma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Go back and finish studying for your test . " Daddy 's back straightened , his bushy mustache crooked as his lips curved down , his eyes widened . " What you say to me , nigger ? " " I 'm not a nigger . My name is Dante . " " So , the nigger speaking up for himself . " " You heard me the first time . And I ai n't a nigger . " " You challenging me ? What , you think because you got a little hair over your dick you 're a grown man now ? Ai n't but one man in this house . " Momma spoke carefully to Daddy . " Do n't get upset . " I frowned at the shiny badge on the chest of his tan uniform , then at the gun in his leather holster . He sucked his teeth , nodded , and jerked the badge off . He threw the gun holster on the love seat . He stepped away from the glass coffee table , opened his arms , and snapped out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll give you the first shot . Nigger , I 'll knock your black ass into the middle of next week . " Momma gripped my arm tight enough for her nails to break my skin . I glanced at the golden cross she had on her chest , the one she had got from her mother just a few weeks before Grandmamma died . I looked into my momma 's light brown eyes , eyes that looked like mine . " Let me go , Momma . " " No . " She put her nose against mine and whispered , " Momma 's okay . It 's just a little scratch . " My knees shook when I stood and faced my old man . When his eyes met mine , his anger held so much power that I forgot how to breathe . Heart went into overdrive . He balled up his right fist , slammed it into the palm of his left hand ; it echoed like thunder . " What are you gon na do , nigger ? " I trembled , backed away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what ? " " Nothing , sir . " I kicked my bare feet into the rust carpet , then slumped my shoulders , wiped my sweaty hands on my jean shorts , and turned around to go back to my room . Then that motherfucker chuckled . A simple laugh that stoked up the rage inside of me . I charged at him as fast and as hard as I could . Momma screamed . Daddy 's eyes widened with surprise . Pain . Anger . Fear . Three screams from three people . From the backseat of the police car , I stared through the wire cage at the colorful rotating lights that were brightening Scottsdale 's earth-tone stucco houses . I was hostage under a calm sky . The spinning glow from twelve squad cars looked like rainbows chasing rainbows . Colors raced over all the sweet gum trees and windmill palms , moved like a strobe light over the vanhoutte spirea in the front of the three-car garage . The reek of cordite was on my flesh . Could n't really smell it over the stench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the pain from the tight handcuffs go away . Watched the rainbows come and go . The door opened . A dry May breeze mixed with the sweltering car air . A police officer stuck his sweaty head inside . His face was hard , his voice angry and anxious . " Your mother wants to say something to you before we lock your ass up . We should n't let her say a damn word to you after what you did . Do you mind ? " I stared straight ahead . " No . " He raised his voice . " No , what ? " " No , " I repeated in a way that let him know I thought that all of them were assholes for making me out to be the bad guy . " I do n't mind . " He gripped the back of my neck . " You 're pretty belligerent . " I was a knob-kneed reed of a boy . Had n't lifted anything heavier than an algebra book and could barely run a mile in P.E . without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before squats , before doing two hundred push-ups in the morning to start my day , doing sprints , before the hooks and jabs and side kicks and roundhouse kicks and spinning back kicks became my trademark . I said , " Fuck you . " With his other hand he grabbed the front of my throat and squeezed , made me gag and look into his blue eyes . He growled , " Say , ' No , sir . I do n't mind , sir . ' You insolent bastard . " He let me go when another officer passed by . I gagged and caught my breath while perspiration tingled down my forehead into my eyes . I tilted my head and looked at him . He smirked . " Now , what you have to say ? " I spat in his face . His cheeks turned crimson . He stared at me while my saliva rolled down his scarred face into his ill-trimmed wheat-colored mustache . " That 's your ass , boy . " Veins popped up in his neck while he stood there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my juices from his eye . He kept watching me , wanted me to break down and show my fear . It was there , but I refused to let it be seen . Another officer passed by and scarface told him what I 'd done . It looked like they were about to double team me , but the second officer said they had to report the assault and they both stormed away . A second later the door opened again and my mother eased her bruised face inside . She said , " Do n't hate me . " " Love you , Momma . " I smiled . " Get away from here . " She fondled her wedding ring . Tears formed in her eyes . She dropped the police blanket from her shoulders , took her cross off , and put it around my neck . She used her soft fingers to wipe the sweat from my eyes . " Somebody 'll come get you out . Maybe Uncle Ray . You might be able to go back to Philly and stay with him for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 're Catholic ; Jehovah 's Witnesses do n't like nobody but Jehovah 's Witnesses . " " Stop saying that . " " It 's true . " " I 'll call him anyway . I 'll tell him you made honor roll , so he 'll know you 're still doing good in school . Let him know you might get a scholarship . You could help him around his grocery store in the evenings . " I shook my head . " Do n't worry about me . Get away before he hurts you . All he 's gon na do is beat you up , then go out to Fort McDowell and spend the night with that Indian woman . He ai n't been home in two days , then walks in complaining about some stupid dinner . Tomorrow he 'll be mad about his shirts . The next day his shoes . " My old man was standing in a crowd of badges , guns , and whispers . The ambulance crew had bandaged his head and he was back on his feet . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . He made a single-finger gesture for Momma to come . My beautiful momma looked tired of the life she was living , and that made me sad . She wiped her eyes and kissed the side of my face . " You understand , do n't you ? You 're a big boy now . Almost a man . You can take care of yourself . You understand . " I kissed the side of her face as my answer . " Do n't be angry . " She twisted her lips . " Do n't be like him . " " I wo n't . " I smiled for her . " Go back inside before you get in trouble . Stop taking so much of that medication . " She rubbed her eyes , then dragged her fingers down across her lips . " It calms my nerves . " " Why you wan na sleep so much ? " " Sometimes , " she patted my legs with her thin fingers , " sometimes I have nice dreams . " She was distant , reciting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't real , Momma . " " Sometimes " she started , then stopped and kissed my forehead . Her voice became as melodic as the poetry she always read . " Sometimes they 're better than what 's real . " I fought the dryness in my throat that always came before my tears . I was scared . Fifteen and a half and living in fear . She wandered away , wringing her hands and looking back at me every other step . We blew each other dysfunctional kisses . I 'd be in juvenile hall , then a boys ' home until I was old enough to register for the draft and vote . Living with criminals would be like going to a different kinda school . Nigerians , Mexicans , Whites , no matter what nationality , they were all caught up in the same game . And did n't hesitate to lend to the schooling on everything from Three Card Monte to Rocks in a Box to Pigeon Drops , even broke down how to pass bad checks . A few were bold enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the education I was after . I had dreams of getting into Howard , to a frat life and a world filled with sorority girls . Always wanted to stomp in a Greek Show . Make enough money to get a small place , get Momma to move in with me . I was working on our escape . But that night , guess I had had all I could stand and could n't stand no more . I wanted to be like a superhero and rescue my momma . That was my mission in life . What motivated me . Hard to save anybody when you 're locked up , when you 're too busy trying to fight to save yourself . When you 've made yourself a prisoner . I did want to save her . That gave my life a lot of purpose . But there would be no Howard . No sorority girl at my side . And the closest thing to a frat I would see would be a bunch of young hardheads lining up for roll call , all wearing prison blues , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go get our meals . Momma would find her own way to freedom . My momma would take too many pills and become an angel . My daddy would be found dead behind the wheel of his Thunderbird at Fort McDowell . Ambushed and shot outside of a married Indian woman 's place . On that night of changes , I sat in the back of that squad car staring at the colorful lights that were dancing in the night to make my pain go away . Watched the rainbows chasing the rainbows . The phone rang . Jarred me from my sleep and severed me from my past . Time to time , I had nightmares , felt the pain from the fights and heard the screams from the midnight rapes in juvenile hall . But I learned to kick ass before I got my ass kicked . The phone rang again . I opened my eyes . Focused on the red digits across the room . 3:32 a.m . Not quite yesterday ; not quite today . Traffic in NoHothat stands for North Hollywoodwas breezing by outside my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a car alarm was singing a song of distress . I snatched the phone up and answered , " Yeah ? " " Where 've you been , Dante ? " I knew who it was . Hearing his voice jarred me all over again . I sat up in my queen-size bed . The room had a chill and I kept the covers wrapped around me . He chuckled , then said , " I was beginning to think you were dead or something . " " A'ight , how you get my number , Scamz ? " " There is n't a number I ca n't get . " " Just got it changed last week . " He laughed his irksome , sneaky laugh . " Happy birthday . You made it to the big two-five . " " On a hot wing and a prayer . " " A black man 's not supposed to live past twenty-five . " " Then that makes me a senior citizen . I should be eligible for Social Security and a ten-percent discount at Denny 's . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's why I like talking to you . " I yawned , then checked my caller ID . No number was on the box . Last time he jingled , the ID box told me he was in New York , lounging at Fifth and Fifty-sixth at the Trump Tower . That was two weeks back . He did n't leave a message , he never did , but I knew that was my homey . Doubt if Donald Trump would be ringing me up to talk shop about the market . Nobody but Scamz . Time before that he told me he was down in South Beach . Time before that Montreal . Before then it was the W down in New Orleans during the Essence Festival . Before that Playa del Carmen . I set another yawn free before I asked , " You back out in La La Land ? " " For a hot sec . Wrapping up some business before I go on vacation . You should 've accepted my offer and left with me last time . Aspen had great skiing . " " Whatcha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few weeks he 'd been running scam after scam after scam . All nonviolent . Most of his dealings were in credit and green cards . Since he had women who worked everywhere from the DMV to the IRS , I already knew there was n't any information he could n't get , so his criminally-gifted butt getting my number did n't cause me to raise a brow . Not right then . " Up until a few days ago , nobody around the pool hall had seen you for months , " Scamz said . " My job was keeping me busy . " " Thought One Time might 've shackled you down and had you on the gray goose heading out to Chino . " " I do n't do prisons . " One Time was a nickname for the police . I yawned . " Like I said , I was working . " " Was ? " " Got laid off . Everything came to a screeching halt when the commercial side of the company stopped producing and the aerospace side picked up . Been out looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw from his cigarette , then blew the smoke out before he spoke again . " Why do you keep wasting your talents on a nine-to-five ? " " Makes me content , that 's all that matters . Do n't need to be rich to be happy . " " What 's the word , any luck ? " I told him I had called my old gig to check my status . Over twenty technicians with more time than I had were waiting to get called back . No one had gotten called back in six months and a few thousand more were getting kicked to the curb . The unemployment office told me to check back in a week or two , which was the same robotic line they ran on the twenty people in front of me . I 'd been hitting a lot of career fairs . Hit one down at the Bonaventure and put in apps with everybody from Aerospace Corporation to Sears . Never seen that many borderline-bankrupt people coming in from all over California and Nevada and Seattle looking for a job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Alameda County Conference and Training Center , but five thousand out-of-work people beat me there . Most were in a line that circled the block by sunrise . I told Scamz , " North or south , ai n't nobody hiring . " " There 's a synchronous world recession , especially in the high-tech world . " " Translate . " " No jobs out there . Jobs were already scarce , and those terrorists exacerbated the situation . " I said , " I got an interview next week . " " Another widget factory ? " " Labor gig . Slinging boxes on a truck from dusk to dawn . " " You 're overqualified for that kind of work . " " A man with no job ai n't overqualified for any kinda work . " " Spoken like a true member of the unemployed . " " You got jokes . " " Seems like a lot of people have been humbled . " I cleared my throat . " They 're offering twelve an hour , but I know they have a stack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed at that . " What 're your ends looking like until that comes through ? " " They ai n't looking . Almost as blind as Helen Keller . " " Your economic recession is in full effect . " " Yep . Seems like the world is fucked up . " We said a few words about the war that was going on , on how it had done a number on people both emotionally and financially . Scamz said , " ' Ours is essentially a tragic age , so we refuse to take it tragically . ' " " Shakespeare ? " " D. H. Lawrence . The opening lines of Lady Chatterley 's Lover . " I yawned . " A regular Nostradamus . " " Come see me today . I got a few things lined up . " " Ca n't . I 'm a legit man . " Scamz asked , " You heard from Jackson ? " I met Jackson a few years back through Scamz . They were the best of friends when I came along . But Jackson had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman and a steady job had him on the straight and narrow . I said , " Yeah . I 've been hanging with him almost every day . " " What you two got going on ? " " We 've been teaming up and looking for jobs together . " " So , he 's getting back on the hustle ? " I debated telling Jackson 's business , but Scamz was n't the type to spread the word about someone else 's misfortunes . And nine times out of ten , he already knew what was going on . I said , " His ex is suing him for back child support . " " Sabrina slapped Jackson with a lawsuit ? " " Yep . She filed papers and claimed Jackson never gave her a dime . " " I do n't believe that . He cared about his kids if nothing else . " " He showed me the papers from the district attorney . " We said a few more things about that . In the end Scamz told me , " Be careful where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sage words . He laughed too . They were laughs of disbelief . We chitchatted about a few other people from our little clandestine world . A few were on lockdown , a few were about to get out . A couple had died along the way . " Big Slim told me you were down at Eight Ball gambling with Nazario , " Scamz said . Eight Ball was a place people went when they were desperate for cash . Trouble and money was always down there . You just had to outrun the trouble to get the money . " Yeah , " I said . " That psycho was so mad he lost his mind . " " Then he did n't lose much . " " He wanted to pay me on the spot . " " People say he made a scene . " " Big time . He made his wife give me her wedding ring to cover his debt . " Scamz said , " He hates to lose , especially in front of a crowd . " " I pawned the ring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for you . He wants a rematch so he can get that ring back . Heard he 's been down at the pool hall at least three times a day trying to find you . " " Kinda figured that . That 's why I ai n't been back down to the pool hall . " " If you sweating over chump change , you must need some economic relief . " My eyes went to my pine dresser . My bills were over there , piled up next to a stack of job rejection postcards . Frustration was bringing out the wolf in me . I told Scamz , " Just need something to hold me over until one of these jobs come through . " He said , " Come see me . You 're a good worker . I could use your help . " I paused . The jury in my mind went out to make a decision . " I 'll pass . I have a few job interviews around the corner . " " Then come make some ends so you can take your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Me no got no woman . Got my eye on this waitress at Ed Debevic 's . " " You ever stepped to her yet ? " " Not yet . She has an L.A. face and an Oakland booty that wo n't quit . Pretty much out of my league . " " How can a waitress be out of anybody 's league ? " " True . " " Be a man at all times . Never let a woman scare you . Never . " Scamz was working my disposition in his direction word by word , phrase by phrase . " Either way , " he said , " it 's hard to get a woman being broke . " Scamz was n't lying . L.A. had its own mentality and it cost to be the boss out here . Whenever I hit Atlas Bar and Grill it was five bucks to park , twenty to get in , and close to ten bucks for one drink . If I met a honey , triple that drinking budget . Breakfast at Roscoe 's would add another twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would cost another five . Trojans were the cheapest thing on the list . Not using one was the most expensive thing on the list . Scamz said , " Pussy and money , Dante . Got money , you can get pussy . Got pussy " " You can get money . " We chuckled at his phrase . My eyes closed when I thought about that waitress , saw her dimples , heard her mature voice , even could see her hips when she did her sensual stroll , and wondered what she was doing right now . A second later I exhaled . " Is this hot or cold ? " Hot meant difficult . Cold meant smooth , minimal problems . I could hear Scamz smile when I asked that . His easy words had worked me toward his team . He replied , " Easy rent money . " " Let 's be up front . I 'm not down for nothing long-term . " " What do I have to do to get you to reconsider ? " " You ca n't . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did that when his mind was in overdrive . Sometimes I thought he had so many thoughts he had to shut down to keep from overloading . Scamz said , " You know how to find me . " We left it at that . He was n't going to give the specifics , not over the wire . I hung up . 3:41 a.m . I dialed another number . Jackson answered on the first ring . I said , " You 're up ? " " Yeah . What 's up , Cool Hand ? " " Scamz called . He 's back and it sounds like he has a few things going on . " Jackson hesitated . " Yeah , Dante . We can check on those interviews after I leave court . " I understood why he was talking in code . I said , " Robin must be over . " " Right . " " See you in a few hours . " We hung up . No matter what time of night I called , he was awake . I did n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular schedule my-damn-self . Not having a job stole away the importance of an alarm clock . It also made it easy to lose track of my days . When a man did n't have a job , did n't have a Monday , a hump day , and a payday , all days started to blend and lose value . All were just today . All he wanted was a better tomorrow . I was on edge , a little hungry . I walked over my two-shades-of-brown carpet , went to the kitchen sink , washed my face , dried it with a paper towel , then opened the fridge , let that light fall on the off-white walls . Do n't know why I opened the fridge . Not like the food fairy had come while I was sleeping . Not much was in there except leftover salmon and rice and a frozen Healthy Choice meal . Restless . Scamz had left me agitated . I did two hundred sit-ups , crunches , worked on my obliques . Did half as many push-ups . Stretched my legs into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right , then went down into a Chinese-style split . Shadowboxed against my old memories until a layer of sweat glistened on my skin . I looked at that stack of job rejection postcards . Anxiety was all over me , clinging to my skin like a thousand ticks . More push-ups until my arms burned . More sit-ups until my abs were on fire . Dealing with Scamz meant I needed to be in shape . Ready to rumble , ready to run . I rested in my sweat . Put on my Levi Chen Liquid Gardens CD . Meditated a few minutes . Then with that music calming me , I stood in my window and looked out at the palm trees . I was lonely . Broke and lonely . L.A. was an expensive bitch . A whore who sucked your dick and swallowed all of your money , then left you sleeping on the concrete . A man stayed broke and hungry long enough , his value system was bound to change . And when it did , Scamz was waiting .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
