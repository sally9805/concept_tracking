<p> Those who know the Banzai Pipeline do n't call it so . Man-eater is more common . Meat grinder . Cement mixer . Or just Pipe . <p> It has shattered femurs and egos and killed expert swimmers . Only those with the good sense to know when they are ready to take it on paddle out beyond the reef . <p> Just ask Rochelle Ballard . She knows . It took nearly 12 years of professional surfing before she would ride the world 's most famed and dangerous surf . <p> " It 's taken me that long not to be afraid of it , " she said . " To be on the peak , make the drop and commit  --  you face all your fears . " <p> Beginning tomorrow and running till Dec. 20 , three sacred beaches along the continental shelf of Oahu 's North Shore in Hawaii will be the site of the premier surfing event in the world  --  the Van 's Triple Crown . NBC and Fox will televise it . Millions of ear-muffed mainlanders will watch it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's most powerful wave , commit to its fury , drop in and hope beyond hope they are not slammed into a coarse coral reef only a few feet below . <p> As they battle , the profit-soaked renaissance of one of the most extreme sports churns forward , through dangerous wipeouts , small swells and even the recent shark attack on a promising 13-year-old girl on the neighboring island of Kauai . <p> The girl , Bethany Hamilton , one of the nation 's top amateurs , was bitten on Oct. 31 by a tiger shark believed to be 14 to 15 feet long . Holt Blanchard , the father of the girl Hamilton was surfing with , helped her to shore and fashioned a tourniquet out of the rubber tubing of his surfboard leash . Hamilton lost all but four inches of her right arm . <p> Ballard is one of the top female professional surfers , and Hamilton attended her free camps . In a telephone conversation last week , Ballard said everyone was stunned by what happened to Hamilton . <p> " One , because she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a top surfer in her age division , it 's a heart-twister , " Ballard said . " It 's just bizarre . " <p> Liam McNamara , a local professional , said by telephone from his home on the North Shore : " It 's been the talk of everyone on the water . She was on her way up , a real special talent . But she 'll be back out there one day , you watch ; she has that kind of determination . " <p> Two days after Hamilton was bitten , McNamara said he was surfing with his friend One-Arm Buddy  --  the nickname for the renowned knee-boarder Buddy McCray , who competes with only one arm  --  and a Brazilian with one leg ( neither lost his limb from surfing ) . <p> " He uses his left leg on the back of the board and he uses his right arm as his second leg , holding onto the front of the board and guiding himself , " McNamara said . <p> " I told the guy , ' Man , you should fly over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her what you 're doing . ' " <p> Such is the resilience of the Hawaiian surfing community , which was hardly deterred by the state 's fourth shark attack this year . And in the molten-hot world of extreme sports , surfing has reclaimed the status briefly seized by snowboarders and skateboarders . The trend , the numbers , the ratings , the Oakley sunglasses and the Quiksilver shorts , the navel rings and gnarly tattoos  --  they all bespeak of a new generation of " Endless Summer " wannabes careening down a turquoise-blue wall of water and foam . <p> " It 's definitely more crowded on the water , " said Dana Brown , the son of Bruce Brown , the director of " The Endless Summer , " the 1966 documentary featuring two young Californians traveling the world 's beaches , in search of the perfect wave . <p> " Dressing like a surfer or acting like a surfer is in again  --  though I 'm not sure creating clothing and culture have much to do with the actual sport , " said Dana Brown , 43 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renewed popularity . His acclaimed documentary , " Step Into Liquid , " released earlier this year , has been the latest Hollywood film to rekindle the sport , after " Blue Crush " in 2002 . <p> In " Step Into Liquid , " the professional Mike Parsons navigates a mammoth wave approaching 70 feet at Cortez Banks , a rarely surfed area 100 miles offshore from San Diego . The film crawls inside the psyche of big-wave riders . <p> " Whatever the scare threshold , I do n't have it , " Dana Brown said in a recent telephone interview . " Even though I surfed big waves growing up , at some point the survival thing overrode the thrill for me . I just felt at one point coming down some huge wave , ' I 'm going to die . ' And that was it . I felt like , ' Wait , this is an elective and I do n't want to be here . ' " <p> At the Banzai Pipeline last month , which along with Haleiwa and Sunset Beach will be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big swell of winter pounded the reef . Red flags were planted up and down the beach , which meant only expert surfers were allowed to paddle out . <p> " In the past two years , we 're getting bombarded by the beginners , " lamented Chris Baker , a lifeguard in Honolulu for the past 13 years . Peering out from the lifeguard tower at Pipeline , Baker said many novices have seen a recent " Charlie 's Angels " or " Blue Crush " surf clip and mistakenly thought they could begin their careers at the world 's most dangerous beach . <p> " We 've seen people die here , " Baker said . " Usually , about one or two a year . They 're not ready for the undertow and currents and they disregard the signs and warnings . <p> " You bang your head on the reef or get pulled out by the current , the ocean does n't give you a second chance . " <p> As he spoke , Baker noticed a novice boogie-boarder heading toward high surf . Another lifeguard in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized the batteries were dead . <p> " God must want him to go out there , " Baker said , before he and Kreitzer used hand signals to motion the waterlogged man back in . <p> " The power here is pretty much unmatched anywhere in the world , " said Pancho Sullivan , another local professional who last week won one of Hawaii 's most prestigious pro-am contests . <p> Sullivan is proof that surfing is big box office . Professionals today earn anywhere from $30,000 to more than $1 million a year . The reigning world champion , Andy Irons , makes more than most role players in the National Basketball Association . Meanwhile , the X Games featured surfing this year for the first time , and at Windward Community College on Oahu , you can take a class in surf science and technology . <p> " It 's been gratifying the last 10 years to see how the business has legitimized itself , " Sullivan said . <p> Sullivan , 30 , spoke last month on a patio of his lush , three-acre parcel in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good to him . He has endorsement contracts promoting clothing , wet suits and watches through RipCurl USA . But , he said , financial security is hardly the allure . <p> " It 's more that thrill of living on the edge , " Sullivan said , " the adrenaline rush you get from living through such a life-threatening experience . When you survive that with your friends , it 's one of the most self-rewarding feelings in the world . " <p> Liam McNamara can echo that sentiment . A year ago , on Oct. 26 , he was on a wave that began at 15 to 18 feet a few hundred feet from Pipeline 's shore . <p> " I got on this wave and it just picked me up and slammed me into the reef , " McNamara said . " It was the equivalent of falling off a two-story building and hitting a brick wall . <p> " I felt something hitting me in the back of the head and I thought it was my board . It turned out to be my foot . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injuries you do n't want to see on TV . " <p> He shattered his right femur and hip and was in the hospital for two weeks . He spent six weeks on crutches and another six months in physical therapy before returning to competition . <p> " There 's definitely a fear in the back of your mind , " McNamara said . " Anybody that surfs big waves and does n't admit that , they 're joking or lying . I 've seen somebody die at Pipe . Those are the chances you take . <p> " But I have two choices : I can retire and get a day job or keep surfing , " he said . " I want to keep surfing . " <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com
