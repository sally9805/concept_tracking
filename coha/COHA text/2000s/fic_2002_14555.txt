Silence . Darkness . A spacious loft apartment , well appointed . Doors leading off in several directions , suggesting a hallway to bedrooms and a bathroom or two . A stainless-steel kitchen , visible . Three large arched windows display a view of other buildings across the street . A kind of amber haze in the air . This is a large sitting room with lovely couches and chairs . Bookshelves heaped high . Framed pictures . A television plays quietly in one corner . A layer of white dust on everything . Absolutely everything . BEN , maybe thirty-three , sits pressed into the corner of one loveseat , staring straight ahead . A cell phone rests in one hand . It rings and rings . After a long moment , the front door opens and a woman of about forty-five enters , also covered in dust and carrying several plastic bags . This is ABBY . She sees BEN as she removes an Herms scarf from around her mouth , but she says nothing , continuing on to the kitchen . She takes off her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When she ca n't stand it any longer , she walks over and takes the phone out of his hand and pushes a button . The ringing stops and she returns the phone to BEN . White clouds of dust follow her every move . ABBY PRESCOTT Save it . BEN HARCOURT Hmm ? p. 3 ABBY PRESCOTT The phone . I turned it off to save it . BEN HARCOURT That 's okay . ABBY PRESCOTT I know it 's okay , I know that . That 's why I did it , because it 's okay . BEN HARCOURT Right . / Sure . ABBY PRESCOTT If you 're not going to use it , then you should keep it off. / Save the battery . BEN HARCOURT Uh-huh . ABBY PRESCOTT Plus the sound drives me crazy . You know ? BEN HARCOURT Sorry I did n't hear it . ABBY PRESCOTT Oh . ( She laughs . ) Okay ( She stands over BEN until he finally looks up . Does n't say anything else . She shakes her head and moves back to the kitchen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ABBY PRESCOTT " Call . " I asked if you called . BEN HARCOURT Ummm ABBY PRESCOTT Of course you did n't . I know you did n't . BEN HARCOURT No , I did n't . ABBY PRESCOTT I knew it . p. 4 BEN HARCOURT Did n't answer it , either ABBY PRESCOTT And are you planning to ? BEN HARCOURT I 'm I was , ahh I was going to , maybe ABBY PRESCOTT Yeah , that 's pretty much where I left you . At the " babbling-to-myself " stage . BEN HARCOURT I keep trying to . ABBY PRESCOTT Really ? BEN HARCOURT Yeah , but but I 'm ABBY PRESCOTT Huh . ( She walks over again , billowing little clouds of white behind her . She takes back the phone for a moment , turns it on . Waits . Checks something as it begins ringing almost immediately . ) The last number you called was the Chinese place . Yesterday morning , for your shirts . / called , actually remember ? BEN HARCOURT Yes . / I do . ABBY PRESCOTT Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ( Looking at the display . ) It 's for you .

I am . Right now . " You were sitting on that couch , the same spot , really , and I was kneeling between your legs when you told me that . Five minutes before it happened . Like , a minute before all this happened . ( Beat . ) Of course , we 've heard about that one a few times now , have n't we ? The BIG CALL . BEN HARCOURT Yes .

BEN HARCOURT Thanks . ABBY PRESCOTT You 're welcome . BEN HARCOURT A lot . p. 7 ABBY PRESCOTT You 're welcome a lot . ( Beat . ) You want a snack ? It 's cheese . BEN HARCOURT No thanks , but no . ABBY PRESCOTT I 'm gon na have some . I 'm going to have some cheese . BEN HARCOURT That 's all right . ABBY PRESCOTT I know it is ! I know it 's all right , and that 's why I 'm going to have some . I 'm going to fix myself a plate of this nice Havarti that I bought for you and a few crackers , and then I 'm I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will , I will I 'm I think I 'll just I 'll ( She does n't finish the sentence but just nods to herself . She goes to the kitchen and begins to cut into the fleshy white cheese and then stops as the tears come . She puts her head down , but her shoulders betray her . After a moment , she calms herself and looks over at BEN , who has n't moved but is looking at her . ) That was a test , by the way to see if you have a decent fucking bone in your body . / Which you failed . BEN HARCOURT I just / I 'm sorry , Abby , but ABBY PRESCOTT What ? You what ? Tell me. p. 8 BEN HARCOURT I just ca n't right now . ABBY PRESCOTT " Ca n't ? " BEN HARCOURT No not at the moment .

ABBY PRESCOTT Jesus , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm just telling you how it is ABBY PRESCOTT Oh great . Thanks , Ben , thanks a bunch . ABBY takes a piece of cheese and shoves it in her mouth . Chews . BEN sits up a bit , brushes off his legs . He turns on the phone and looks at it . It rings . BEN HARCOURT Should I ? ABBY PRESCOTT Answer it or keep it off . It 's up to you . BEN HARCOURT Maybe I should I mean ABBY PRESCOTT Yeah , maybe you really , really should . Go ahead . BEN HARCOURT just say I 'm doing all right or / You know ABBY PRESCOTT Go ahead . / Do it . p. 9 BEN HARCOURT Yeah I probably should . ABBY PRESCOTT An-swer ! ( Just then the phone stops ringing . Dead quiet . Maybe the sound of sirens way off . ) Too late . You 're too late , Ben . As always . BEN HARCOURT I see that . ABBY PRESCOTT Once again , your ability to be completely off the mark is uncanny . BEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BEN HARCOURT Thanks again . ABBY PRESCOTT Welcome . ( They look at each other and almost smile . Almost . BEN fiddles with his cell phone a bit while ABBY nibbles at a cracker . ) It 's been nearly a day BEN HARCOURT I know . ABBY PRESCOTT Almost an entire day since it happened . BEN HARCOURT I know that . ABBY PRESCOTT I mean , the world has gone absolutely nuts out there ; it really , really has No idea what 's happening , no one does , the army patrolling around  --  there are people in camouflage on the Brooklyn Bridge  --  and you 're , I do n't know , just I do n't know where you are . p. 10 BEN HARCOURT Abby , I 'm right here . ABBY PRESCOTT Why is that not comforting when you say it ? BEN HARCOURT I I 'm just saying that I know what 's happening . I do . I 'm aware of the situation here . / And out there ABBY PRESCOTT You are ? / Really ?

ABBY PRESCOTT " Sure , you can suck my dick , but " BEN HARCOURT Abby , STOP IT ! ABBY PRESCOTT Why do n't you just change your name ? It 's only two letters and you 're there . " B-U-T " instead of " B-E-N. " / It 's not a bad little nickname p. 11 BEN HARCOURT Abby , I said / Why are you doing this ? ABBY PRESCOTT Because it makes me curious , that 's all .

ABBY PRESCOTT I do n't think that 's true . / No , uh-uh . ( Beat . ) ' Cause after the shock of it , okay , after the obvious sort of shock that anyone goes through your first thought was that this is an opportunity BEN HARCOURT Yeah , but I meant for us. / Just as a possibility for us ABBY PRESCOTT Who does that ? ! / Who in their right mind is going to see this as having " unlimited potential " ? BEN HARCOURT I did n't mean it like / No , I just meant that ABBY PRESCOTT It 's a meal ticket , that 's exactly what you said ! / " Our meal ticket " to a banquet that , lately , you have n't seemed all that eager to attend / Meaning , " me . " BEN HARCOURT Abby , that 's not / No , that is not the p. 12 ABBY PRESCOTT And so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how does Mr. Ben Harcourt feel inside about all this ? Hmm ? BEN HARCOURT I feel you know / I 'm very I mean ABBY PRESCOTT No , Ben , I do n't know . That 's why I 'm asking you . / How do you feel ? Hmm ? BEN HARCOURT Not good . ABBY PRESCOTT " Not good .

Jesus . ( Beat . ) It 's horrific . A complete and , and , and utter ABBY PRESCOTT Fill in the blank . BEN HARCOURT tragedy . It 's beyond belief . Biblical .

I feel shitty about it ! ! ABBY PRESCOTT And why 's that ? BEN HARCOURT You know why / Come off it ABBY PRESCOTT No , I do n't , no not really . / No , we talked about " thank God you were n't in there " and other survivor guilt-type shit , but we have n't really discussed how you BEN HARCOURT Jesus , Abby , this is what do you want ? I ca n't believe it ! I 'm in shock . I feel like I 'm gon na throw up , okay , like I might just heave my guts out here on your faux-Persian rug or something . How 's that ? I-feel-shitty ! Is that enough ? ABBY PRESCOTT It 's a start . ( Beat . ) The rug 's real , by the way . BEN HARCOURT I do n't know what to say . ABBY PRESCOTT Well , that 's nothing new . ( Beat . ) So how shitty ? BEN HARCOURT Abby ! ABBY PRESCOTT No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and do something about it ? To go pitch in down at a hospital , or hand out food On a shitty scale of 1 to 10 , how shitty is your shitty feeling ? p. 14 BEN HARCOURT You 're just trying to provoke something here . ABBY PRESCOTT No , I 'm not at all . I 'm really interested . I am . ( Beat . ) I was thinking about this last night , woke up next to you on the couch there and I started thinking . I mean , I know how I feel , I know that , and I just wanted to be clear about where you and I stand on this thing . As a couple , I mean . BEN HARCOURT What " thing " ? ABBY PRESCOTT Just this whole " morality " thing . You know . BEN HARCOURT I mean shit , it 's obvious that it 's a catastrophe , right ? That 's Why even mention that ? It 's beyond . I ca n't really find words that 're even ABBY PRESCOTT Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! They all sound lame . / No . It 's impossible . ABBY comes out into the living area now , provoking BEN . He stirs . ABBY PRESCOTT Try . / Okay , no words , then . Action . That 's what I 'm saying . Do you feel " not good " enough  --  your words , not mine  --  to go out and take some action , back this feeling up with a little I du n no some kind of p. 15 BEN HARCOURT You want me to , what , go down on the street ? ABBY PRESCOTT Only if you feel like it . BEN HARCOURT Of course I do . Of course , Abby but I ca n't . ABBY PRESCOTT Thank you ! I knew it was coming . BEN HARCOURT You know I can't. / You already know that ! ABBY PRESCOTT Yeah , yeah , I know . / I just wanted to hear that you wished you could . BEN HARCOURT I do . Obviously I do . ABBY PRESCOTT I do n't believe you . BEN HARCOURT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PRESCOTT Yeah . ( Beat . ) On my way back down here , from the store , I followed someone . I mean , I saw this woman wandering along , putting up Xeroxes of this guy . A young man . Probably not her husband , looked too young for her , but then , hey ( Points to herself and BEN . ) I do n't think so , though . But she 's just shuffling along in the dark with sunglasses on and this stack of pages , some masking tape , doing it at random . Light poles , the sides of buildings , even on a car or two . Seriously . Did n't put the thing under the wiper but taped it right to the window . A picture of this smiling young man . In a tuxedo . " Have You Seen Him ? " and a phone number . ( Beat . ) I must 've trailed her for , like , ten blocks or so before I realized I 'd missed my street . p. 16 BEN HARCOURT Wow . / @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This whole city 's covered in copies BEN HARCOURT Uh-huh . They said that on the news . ABBY PRESCOTT Somebody at Kinko 's corporate is probably laughing his ass off right now . BEN HARCOURT Yep . ( A thin smile . ) So , did you help her ? ABBY PRESCOTT What ? BEN HARCOURT I 'm saying , did you help her out at all ? Taping the signs up or anything ? ABBY PRESCOTT No , I didn't. / I had the groceries and everything but umm / I was just trying to BEN HARCOURT Oh , okay / ahh , " but . " / I see . ABBY PRESCOTT I get where you 're going / I get it , Ben . BEN HARCOURT Fine . / Good . ( Beat . ) Look , it 's sad , Abby , we already know that . It is . But my standing around and giving out Twix bars or shit like that is not gon na mean a damn thing it is n't . ABBY PRESCOTT I know . It 'd just be nice if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , sorry . ABBY PRESCOTT that 's all . BEN HARCOURT You know why I ca n't , anyway . / We 've discussed it . ABBY PRESCOTT Yeah , I know . / I know BEN HARCOURT Why I 'm not answering the phone , or I mean , come on . ABBY PRESCOTT The " meal ticket , " I know . BEN HARCOURT So all right , then . ( Beat . ) Does n't mean I 'm not torn up about this , that it does n't , you know , cover my soul . ABBY PRESCOTT " Cover my soul " ? Jesus , Ben , please BEN HARCOURT It " moves " me , of course it does ! But we 've got ta look at the implications here . What it means to us , our future . I do n't wan na sound crass here or unfeeling or ABBY PRESCOTT No , that could never happen . BEN HARCOURT Listen to me ! I do n't but do you honestly think we 're not gon na rebound from this ? And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying the country as a whole . Of course we will . We 'll do what it takes , go after whomever we need to , call out the tanks and shit , but we 're gon na have the World Series , and Christmas , and all the other crap that you can count on in life . We do it , every year , no matter what 's happened or is going on , we still go to the movies and buy gifts and take a two-week vacation , because that's-the-way-it-is . ( Beat . ) I 'm not making light of anything , either , when I say that , or making excuses for what we 've decided you know this is not about that . I 'm saying the American way is to overcome , to conquer , to come out on top . And we do it by spending and eating and screwing our women harder than anyone else . That 's all I 'm saying . p. 18 ABBY PRESCOTT That 's really moving / It 's like seeing a Norman Rockwell for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what we do . It 's what we 're good at / Come on , gim me a break ABBY PRESCOTT It 's just I mean , it 's sooo , what , outlandish , you saying that ! I do n't even know where to BEN HARCOURT I 'm not saying it 's " great , " I 'm saying it 's a fact ! This is a national disaster , yes until the next time the Yankees win the pennant , then we 'll all move on from there . Sorry , but it 's true . ( Beat . ) And I do understand the " big picture " here . The larger context , I mean . I do . ABBY PRESCOTT Yeah ? You 've been keeping track on CNN , or BEN HARCOURT No . ABBY PRESCOTT somebody send by an interoffice memo ? BEN HARCOURT No , not exactly . I just sort of know . You know ? ABBY PRESCOTT You " know . " Oh . ( Beat . ) You mean , like Kreskin or something ? Like that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ / You did n't win the argument , so now you 're gon na p. 19 ABBY PRESCOTT Very good . / See you 're not that much in shock , are you ? BEN HARCOURT Guess not . ( Beat . ) Actually , I do n't know who Kreskin is , I just figured you were being mean-spirited and went with it . ABBY PRESCOTT Touch . ( Beat . ) You do n't remember who the Amazing Kreskin was ? Seriously ? BEN HARCOURT No . ABBY PRESCOTT Come on ! BEN HARCOURT I do n't I 'm sure it 's one of those " you would n't understand " things . I probably was n't old enough ABBY PRESCOTT Well , at least you 're still sweet . BEN HARCOURT I do n't mean that you 're I 'm just saying whatever . ABBY PRESCOTT Yep , that 's us . " Whatever . " Pretty much sums it up . ( Beat . ) Kreskin was a mystic . Well , not a mystic , really , not that , but just this guy on TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a way  --  he was a psychic , I guess that 's what you 'd call him . Psychic . He 'd walk around the studio , he had this show on television , Sundays , and he 'd wander through the place telling people stuff about their lives . Reading their minds . Calling out the name of their dead dog , their mother 's birth date , crap like that . Figuring out where they lost their keys or their way in life , that kind of thing . Even card tricks . Sort of . That 's who Kreskin was around the time of Wild Kingdom and Disney and all those shows . Every Sunday night . When I was a teenager . ( Beat . ) Just forget it . p. 20 BEN HARCOURT No , but , I mean what was the point of that ? ABBY PRESCOTT I do n't know . I really do n't . BEN HARCOURT Oh . Okay . ABBY PRESCOTT Yeah . Let 's stop right there at those frightening generational gaps that rage between us . BEN HARCOURT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I mean , a bit . ABBY PRESCOTT Ben BEN HARCOURT Well , a dozen years , but ABBY PRESCOTT Just leave it . ( BEN nods and stops there . The cell phone begins to ring again . They look at each other as he switches it off . ) Audie Murphy would be so proud . BEN HARCOURT Who 's that ? ABBY PRESCOTT No one . ( She chuckles . ) Do n't worry about it . BEN HARCOURT Another member of the ol ' Sunday-night lineup or something ? ABBY PRESCOTT You 're such a shit . BEN HARCOURT Yeah , and do n't forget I 'm in shock . Imagine what I can do when I 'm really firing on all cylinders . ABBY PRESCOTT Oh , I 'm well aware , believe me . Believe you me p. 21 BEN HARCOURT No , come on , go ahead who is this Murphy person ? ABBY PRESCOTT Geez , you 're just , like , a complete cultural moron . BEN HARCOURT Yep . Pretty much , yeah , and you know why ? ABBY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's no reward for knowing any of it . Trivia . / It 's frivolous to you . BEN HARCOURT Exactly ! / That 's exactly my point . ABBY PRESCOTT You ever hear that " knowledge is its own reward " ? BEN HARCOURT Knowledge is shit , okay ? " Knowledge for Knowledge 's Sake " is pure bullshit . ( Beat . ) All learning ever does is remind you of what you have n't got . Teaches you about new stuff you 'll never be or have . Because unless you can apply that knowledge and do something with it , it 's useless . It 's crap . Worthless shit . An MBA is one thing , but Jeopardy ! is for assholes ABBY PRESCOTT Well , well Goliath awakes . BEN HARCOURT I 'm just saying ABBY PRESCOTT I heard you . BEN HARCOURT I 'm just saying it , that 's all . p. 22 ABBY PRESCOTT And it 's been noted . ( Beat . ) Duly noted . BEN HARCOURT Do n't . ABBY PRESCOTT What ? BEN HARCOURT You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know what you 're talking about . BEN HARCOURT Yes , you do . Of course you do . I 've told you not to ABBY PRESCOTT And do n't say " just do n't " to me , Ben . BEN HARCOURT I 'm saying " do n't say that , " that 's what I 'm saying . You know what I 'm saying , we 've had this argument a hundred times since we 've been / Yes , we have , we 're always ABBY PRESCOTT No , we haven't. / We never get to the argument because any time you 've ever told me " just do n't , " I tell you to NEVER say that to me ! BEN HARCOURT Yeah , well , just do n't I mean it . ABBY PRESCOTT Oooooooh . You 're so sexy when you 're being a prick . BEN HARCOURT Abby , just do n't . ABBY PRESCOTT Stop it ! / Do n't say that ! ! BEN HARCOURT You stop ! / I said " do n't " first ! ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ! ! ABBY PRESCOTT What did I say ? ! What ? BEN HARCOURT You know what you said , what you always say ! ABBY PRESCOTT What ? ! ! BEN HARCOURT " It 's been noted ! Duly noted ! ! " You know you said that , you , say it all the time . ABBY PRESCOTT Oh . ( Beat . ) I said that again ? BEN HARCOURT Yes , you did . ABBY PRESCOTT I did n't even realize it , I 'm sorry . BEN HARCOURT Fine , then . ABBY PRESCOTT Fine . BEN HARCOURT I just do n't want that . / I wo n't take it . Seriously . ABBY PRESCOTT What ? / What , Ben what wo n't you " take " ? BEN HARCOURT You know . / That . Being treated like one of your underlings . ABBY PRESCOTT No. / You are , though , Ben . BEN HARCOURT I am not ! And I wo n't be treated like it . ABBY PRESCOTT Well , I 'm not trying to start something , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't work under you . ABBY PRESCOTT No ? BEN HARCOURT No , I do not . I hold a position that supports yours . ABBY PRESCOTT Yes , you do . BEN HARCOURT is subordinate to yours , maybe . ABBY PRESCOTT True . BEN HARCOURT I get paid less . ABBY PRESCOTT Quite a bit less . BEN HARCOURT Somewhat less . Right . That 's all true ABBY PRESCOTT But ? BEN HARCOURT But I 'm not " under " you . You do not tower over me in some literal or figurative way . ABBY PRESCOTT This may be drifting toward semantics BEN HARCOURT No , it 's not . I have a point and it 's not . ( Beat . ) I am your colleague . Your co-worker . Your partner . ABBY PRESCOTT Okay , Ben , I get it . BEN HARCOURT No , I just want to point out that ABBY PRESCOTT Geez , I wish you were this specific when you tell me to do that one thing with my tongue that you like p. 25 BEN HARCOURT That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BEN HARCOURT No , it is n't . At all . ABBY PRESCOTT It 's pretty funny . BEN HARCOURT No , it 's not . It 's not at all funny not when I 'm trying to say something . Something about us . ABBY PRESCOTT You 've said it , Ben . I-get-it . I do . And I 'm sorry if what I say sometimes hurts you . BEN HARCOURT Well , it does . Sometimes . When you do . ABBY PRESCOTT Was that a sentence ? BEN HARCOURT I 'm serious ! ABBY PRESCOTT Fine . BEN HARCOURT You belittle me . You make me feel small . ABBY PRESCOTT And yet , somehow , I do n't tower over you BEN HARCOURT Abby , stop it ! ! ABBY PRESCOTT Okay , okay . I was kidding . Please . BEN HARCOURT Whatever . ABBY PRESCOTT I was . Fair enough ? Can we stop ? BEN HARCOURT Yes . ( Beat . ) And I 'm sorry I said the other thing . The " just do n't " thing . p. 26 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying it at you , anyway , I was ABBY PRESCOTT I know , but BEN HARCOURT I just meant do n't say the " duly noted " thing , like I 'm some Egyptian slave , or whatever . / Anyway ABBY PRESCOTT I accept your apology . / Yes , anyway BEN HARCOURT Okay . ( Beat . ) And if I am " under " you , I mean , if people would say that about me , behind my back , some Old World phrase like that it 's because you have never , in your infinite wisdom , seen fit to promote me . ( A pause in which BEN suddenly stands and dusts himself off a bit . Moves the pillows around . Sits back down and ponders his cell phone . ABBY watches . ) Who the hell is Audrey Murphy , anyway ? ABBY PRESCOTT It 's " Audie . " He 's a guy . BEN HARCOURT Oh . Audie is a guy 's name ? ABBY PRESCOTT Yes . And anyway , it 's no big thing . BEN HARCOURT No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well ABBY PRESCOTT It was just a p. 27 BEN HARCOURT He must be somebody important . Somebody who does something better than me or you would n't have brought him up . ABBY PRESCOTT Ben , honestly , it 's not a big deal . BEN HARCOURT I wan na know ! I do . ABBY PRESCOTT Oh , for God 's ( Beat . ) Did you ever see To Hell and Back ? BEN HARCOURT Uh-uh . What is that , on the TV ? ABBY PRESCOTT No . It 's a movie . Well , he wrote the book first , and then then BEN HARCOURT So he 's an author . Big deal . ABBY PRESCOTT He acted in it as well . The movie . BEN HARCOURT He did ? ABBY PRESCOTT Yes . BEN HARCOURT Oh . Now he 's an actor , too . ABBY PRESCOTT Uh-huh . BEN HARCOURT Did he play himself ? ABBY PRESCOTT Umm yes , he did . I guess so , but BEN HARCOURT Well , that 's not really acting , then , is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ! It 's still acting . p. 28 BEN HARCOURT No , it 's not not technically . ABBY PRESCOTT Ben , yes , it is He was re-creating what happened to him during the war . World War II . But I 'm sure they did many takes of each scene , over and over , like they do . Re-enacting it . So I 'd call that acting , would n't you ? BEN HARCOURT I guess . Playing himself , though . That 's kinda weak ABBY PRESCOTT He was very good . And he did that other movie called , ahh , you know , the / Red Badge of Courage . BEN HARCOURT No / The Civil War one ? ABBY PRESCOTT Yes ! See , you 're not an absolute moron . BEN HARCOURT No , even I was forced to take a lit class or two . ( Beat . ) That was Stephen Crane . He died young , / twenty-nine or something . ABBY PRESCOTT Well , he played the lead part in that as well / Huh . BEN HARCOURT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ABBY PRESCOTT What do you mean ? BEN HARCOURT I 'm saying the guy was no Brando , that 's what I 'm saying . And yes , I know who Brando is . ( Beat . ) He did a couple war pictures What is the point here ? p. 29 ABBY PRESCOTT No point . Sorry I brought it up . BEN HARCOURT No , uh-uh , I turned off my phone . I did n't answer it and turned it off and you said your " Andy Murphy " crack , so tell me why he 's so ABBY PRESCOTT " Audie . " His name was " Audie Murphy . " Jesus BEN HARCOURT Why 'd you say that to me ? ABBY PRESCOTT I was being ironic . BEN HARCOURT Oh God no , not that , please . ABBY PRESCOTT I was .

( He reaches down and scoops up the remote , savagely pushing the off button . ) I want to know what the hell is so ironic about some Audie Murphy in reference to me ! ! ABBY looks squarely at BEN and then picks up some cheese . Pops it in her mouth . Finishes it . p. 30 ABBY PRESCOTT He was a hero . BEN HARCOURT A what ? ABBY PRESCOTT Ha ! ( She laughs . ) You do n't even recognize the word . BEN HARCOURT What do you mean , " hero " ? What kind of hero ? ABBY PRESCOTT A war hero . A hero in the World War . That 's what he was , and that 's why I said it . BEN HARCOURT Oh . ( Beat . ) A hero , huh ? ABBY PRESCOTT Apparently so . Medal of Honor and all that . BEN HARCOURT And so the irony is ABBY PRESCOTT When juxtaposed with you BEN HARCOURT Got it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ABBY glances sharply over at BEN , which makes him smile . ) Ha-ha-ha . How ironic . How utter fuckingly ironic . ABBY PRESCOTT Just forget it . BEN HARCOURT Wow , that was a good one ! / Jesus , you ought a be on Leno . ABBY PRESCOTT Ben / Knock it off . BEN HARCOURT No , I 'm serious , you should 've ended up in that one lesbian chick 's video thing , you 're so goddamn clever . p. 31 ABBY PRESCOTT Who ?

" ABBY PRESCOTT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you BEN HARCOURT So what ? / What do I care ? ABBY PRESCOTT I know you do n't care . Because it 's trivia . BEN HARCOURT No , trivial , that 's what it is .

BEN HARCOURT I do n't exactly sleep like a baby next to you , either , honey . ABBY PRESCOTT No , I mean it . You do . ( Beat . ) And how the hell did you remember she 's Canadian if you do n't like trivia ? p. 32 BEN HARCOURT Because VH1 , as usual , played the shit out of it when it first came out .

BEN HARCOURT I do , and it was always on with the pop-up things ABBY PRESCOTT Yes , but that 's still pretty BEN HARCOURT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How 's that for a reality check , huh ? Because my daughter liked the song ABBY PRESCOTT Okay . BEN HARCOURT Because my twelve-year-old , who is probably sobbing her eyes out right now , wondering where her daddy is , likes the same fucking song that you just used to tease me with ! That 's how I know ! ! ( Beat . ) Better ? ABBY PRESCOTT All right , Ben , I 'm sorry . / I am BEN HARCOURT Great , you 're sorry . / That 's really terrific . ( Beat . ) Yep . ABBY PRESCOTT Do n't .

BEN HARCOURT Oh , it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HARCOURT ( He is about to say something else , but thinks better of it , bites his tongue .

ABBY PRESCOTT They 're saying close to five . Around there . BEN HARCOURT God . ABBY PRESCOTT All those people just ( She snaps her fingers . ) BEN HARCOURT Yeah . ABBY PRESCOTT Including you . BEN HARCOURT Mmm-hmm . ABBY PRESCOTT You 've been lost , Ben . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughtfully at this , moves to yet another window . Tries to look down the street . ABBY steps out toward him . ) I would n't do that too much . People do know you around here . Well , they do n't " know " you , but you know . BEN HARCOURT Right . That 's true . ABBY PRESCOTT I mean , I 'm not sure anyone could ever really know Ben Harcourt , but you see what I 'm saying . p. 36 BEN HARCOURT Uh-huh . I get it . ABBY PRESCOTT They know the face . That wonderful face of yours / At the mailbox . Coming up the stairs . You are " known . " BEN HARCOURT Great . / Well , I 'll be careful , then . BEN steps away , wandering the room a bit . Stops in front of the TV and turns it on . ABBY PRESCOTT Good . I mean , you would n't wan na blow your cover just yet , right , sweetie ? BEN HARCOURT You know , Abby , that 's ABBY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em . BEN just waves her off , too tired of this to engage anywhere . ABBY watches . Suddenly , ABBY 'S home phone rings three times . BEN and ABBY stare at each other . It stops ringing . BEN HARCOURT Looks like it might be higher . / Maybe six ABBY PRESCOTT Huh . / That 's horrible . BEN HARCOURT Shit six thousand people . Fuck . ABBY PRESCOTT Unless they 're all hiding out at their girlfriends ' houses . BEN HARCOURT Jesus , that 's cynical . p. 37 ABBY PRESCOTT I thought that was one of the rules of disaster to keep it light . BEN HARCOURT Not that light . ABBY PRESCOTT Sorry . BEN HARCOURT Forget it . ( Beat . ) It 's like February . You know ? If I just woke up , from maybe a long sleep or something , and went to the window , I 'd think it was the middle of winter . ABBY PRESCOTT Well , it does n't feel like winter . Not out there . Not at all . BEN HARCOURT I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks like , okay ? It 's not a definitive weather forecast , for chrissakes . I 'm just saying how it looks / Like the last place on Earth . ABBY PRESCOTT Oh . / If it was snow , we could go down and enjoy it . BEN HARCOURT Mmm-hmm . ABBY PRESCOTT Make angels and go skiing , and all that shit we used to do . BEN HARCOURT Yep . ABBY PRESCOTT Except you ca n't go outside , right ? Do n't wan na be spotted . BEN HARCOURT Why do you have to keep saying ? ABBY PRESCOTT Just pointing out the " irony . " Sorry . p. 38 BEN HARCOURT Whatever . ABBY PRESCOTT But if it was , snow , I mean , and none of this stuff had ever happened , then we could . We could go play . BEN HARCOURT Yeah . ABBY PRESCOTT Like when we first met . BEN HARCOURT Sure . ABBY PRESCOTT Remember ? BEN HARCOURT ' Course . Vermont ABBY PRESCOTT Yeah You sliced your hand open on the binding . ( She smiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HARCOURT Right ! Had to get a stitch or two , did n't I ? ABBY PRESCOTT Exactly . Three , I think BEN HARCOURT Stupid thing the corner was all exposed . ( Beat . ) Still , it was a great trip . ABBY PRESCOTT Yep . Back when we liked each other . BEN looks over at ABBY , uncertain . ABBY glances at him , but returns to putting away the cheese and the rest of the groceries . BEN HARCOURT What 's that supposed to mean ? p. 39 ABBY PRESCOTT Nothing . BEN HARCOURT No , seriously . ABBY PRESCOTT Nothing , Ben . Not anything . BEN HARCOURT I still like you What do you mean ? ABBY PRESCOTT I 'm saying those first days were lovely . Really special . That 's all I 'm saying . BEN HARCOURT I do , too ! I mean , feel that way . ( Beat . ) Listen , God , Abby , you got ta know , I mean , I know that you know This is not me . Like me , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not normally like that . I just But when I looked at it , for even a second , all I could see is , yeah , it 's sad , it 's just unbelievably horrid and all that shit , but this is it . This is the moment . Our moment . Everything comes down to what we decide right here . Today . I use my Discover card or get picked up on a mini-mart video camera , it 's over . Finished . The whole thing 's lost . And so that 's why I 'm you know Fuck . I du n no . ABBY PRESCOTT Then good . ( Beat . ) I just wish , whatever happens , it could always be like that . Like Vermont . BEN HARCOURT It can . Abby , that 's what all this ( Beat . ) Christ , that 's what this is about ! It can be like that now . Always . That 's why we 're doing it . p. 40 ABBY PRESCOTT I guess so BEN HARCOURT Right ? I mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some cutthroat pirate of the high seas ? Huh ? Hell , I 'm just trying to muddle through , that 's all , just muddle my fucking way through to middle age , see if I can make it that far . You like trivia so goddamn much , well , here 's a little tidbit for ya I 'm faking it . Okay ? Totally getting by on fumes . I put my game face on and go out there and I 'm scared shitless . ( Beat . ) You know what ? I take that back This is me . I 've screwed up every step of my life , Abby , I 'm not afraid to admit it . Happy to , actually , I am happy to sing it out there for anybody who wants to hear . I always take the easy route , do it faster , simpler , you know , whatever it takes to get it done , be liked , get by . That 's me . Cheated in school , screwed over my friends , took whatever I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage , there 's a goddamn fiasco , of which you 're intimately aware . The kids I barely register as a dad , I 'm sure , but compared to the other shit in my life , I 'm Doctor-fucking-Spock . No matter what I do or have done , they adore the hell out of me , and I 'm totally knocked out by that . What kids are like . Yeah . ( Beat . ) And you , let 's not forget you . Us . Okay , yes , I have n't done all that I 've promised , said I 'd do , I fuck up along the way . All right . But I 'm trying , this time out  --  with you , I mean  --  I have been trying . Do n't know what it looks like , feels to you , but I have made a real go of us , and that is not a lie . It is n't . And so then , yesterday through all the smoke and fear and just , I du n no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it , to totally erase the past  --  and I do n't think it makes me Lucifer or a criminal or some bad man because I noticed it . I really do n't . We 've been given something here . A chance to I do n't know what , to wash away a lot of the , just , rotten crap we 've done . More than anything else , that 's what this is . A chance . I know it is. p. 41 ABBY PRESCOTT Yeah , but it 's tainted / it 's a fluke . BEN HARCOURT What ? / No , it 's not that , no , it 's ABBY PRESCOTT We got lucky . Or , more specifically you did . But you did n't earn it . BEN HARCOURT What 're you talking about ? ABBY PRESCOTT I 'm just saying that it was a happy coincidence that you managed to be over here at my place yesterday morning , getting your proverbial cock sucked , when it happened that 's all . ( Beat . ) Right ? BEN HARCOURT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the year you 're supposed to be down there for us and you decide to skip out , come over , get some head that 's not bad . BEN HARCOURT So ? ABBY PRESCOTT So there 's probably a lot of spouses out there right now who wish their dearly departed would 've stopped to pick up a nice Frappuccino or dropped off that roll of film they were carrying around in their pocket hell , maybe paid for a blow job , even . Whatever it takes to stay alive . ( Beat . ) I 'm saying you really dodged a bullet there . p. 42 BEN HARCOURT Plane . I dodged a plane . ABBY PRESCOTT Ooooohhh . Careful with the humor thing , remember ? BEN HARCOURT Yeah ( Beat . ) That 's a shitty thing to say . ABBY PRESCOTT Even if it 's true ? BEN HARCOURT Yes . Even then . ABBY PRESCOTT Sorry . I 'm an honest person ( She laughs . ) Mostly . BEN HARCOURT Yeah , make sure you slip that one in . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be pointing a finger at me , Mr. Harcourt . BEN HARCOURT I just may be , Ms. Prescott . ABBY PRESCOTT Ahh . And what , in your mind , have I been dishonest about ? BEN HARCOURT Nothing I mean , other than , oh your entire life . ( He sits back down on this , pulls out the cell phone again . He turns it on and sets it on one knee . ) ABBY PRESCOTT I 'm being dishonest ? BEN HARCOURT Just a little . ABBY PRESCOTT About what ? p. 43 BEN HARCOURT Come on ABBY PRESCOTT No , seriously , what 're you ? BEN HARCOURT Which category work , rest , or play ? ABBY PRESCOTT You tell me . BEN HARCOURT Well , umm me . There 's that topic . ABBY PRESCOTT You ? BEN HARCOURT Yes . I think so , yes . / For three years ABBY PRESCOTT How ? / What , that we 're an item ? BEN HARCOURT Yeah . That . ABBY PRESCOTT Oh , come on . BEN HARCOURT What ? ABBY PRESCOTT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people ! Well , not your wife , maybe , but that 's about it . BEN HARCOURT That 's not true . ABBY PRESCOTT She knows ? BEN HARCOURT No , Jesus I mean people . People do n't know . ABBY PRESCOTT Ben , come on . I 'm sure they do . BEN HARCOURT I 'm serious . We 've been cautious . p. 44 ABBY PRESCOTT We have ? / When ? BEN HARCOURT Yes ! / What 're you talking about ?

BEN HARCOURT I 've been a steel trap this whole time . ABBY PRESCOTT Of course you have . BEN HARCOURT I have ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you . BEN HARCOURT So then , what ? ABBY PRESCOTT I have been . BEN HARCOURT What ? ABBY PRESCOTT Indiscreet . BEN HARCOURT You have what ? Told someone ? p. 45 ABBY PRESCOTT Yes . BEN HARCOURT Shit . I mean why the fuck would you do that ? Huh ? ABBY PRESCOTT Because I used to be proud of the fact . BEN HARCOURT Oh . ABBY PRESCOTT Back whenever .

I 'm sure people 've forgotten / I know / have . BEN HARCOURT I was n't being / Come on , you know what I 'm saying . ABBY PRESCOTT Of course I do . I 've always known . BEN HARCOURT Okay , then . ABBY PRESCOTT You like fucking the boss , but you do n't want it getting around . BEN HARCOURT Abby ABBY PRESCOTT Get it . I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask the boss sometime if she likes fucking you . BEN looks over at this . ABBY wanders to the window and looks out . Comes slowly back into the room as BEN follows her with his eyes . After a moment , ABBY 'S phone rings , then stops after three rings . Silence as they look at each other . p. 46 BEN HARCOURT And what 's that supposed to mean ? ABBY PRESCOTT Just a suggestion . BEN HARCOURT Ask you if what ? ABBY PRESCOTT How I feel about the two of us . BEN HARCOURT I know how you feel about us . ABBY PRESCOTT You do ? BEN HARCOURT Of course , I yes , sure . I do . ABBY PRESCOTT Oh . BEN HARCOURT Do n't I ? ABBY PRESCOTT Sure you do . BEN HARCOURT I mean ABBY PRESCOTT I 'm sure you think you do , anyway . BEN HARCOURT All right , this is I know what you 're doing . ABBY PRESCOTT What ? BEN HARCOURT I see what I know this trick . ABBY PRESCOTT I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you are . This is the " make Ben feel insecure " thing . / I know this game . ABBY PRESCOTT Do n't be insecure . / It 's not a game p. 47 BEN HARCOURT Listen , you do n't like having sex with me , you would n't have it . It 's that simple . / You 're that kind of woman . ABBY PRESCOTT Nothing 's that simple / You think so ? BEN HARCOURT I know so . ( Beat . ) You do n't like some assistant at work , they 're outta there in twenty minutes . You do n't fancy a salt shaker in the cafeteria , it 's changed . If you did n't want us coming over here , or sneaking off at conferences and me banging the shit outta you , we would n't be doing it . ABBY PRESCOTT Really ? BEN HARCOURT Yeah , really . I mean , you 're the fucking " guy " in this relationship , let 's not kid ourselves ABBY PRESCOTT Okay , Ben BEN HARCOURT Ms. Prescott sports the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got to ! BEN HARCOURT Yeah , but somebody does n't have to be an overdominating cunt about it ( Beat . ) Sorry , shit , I did n't mean you know ABBY PRESCOTT Oh , I 'm sure you meant that in the best possible way . p. 48 BEN HARCOURT No , I just ABBY PRESCOTT As you always say , Ben whatever . ABBY heads back to the safety of the kitchen . BEN looks at the phone and shakes it , listens . BEN HARCOURT I do n't have any sexual problems . ABBY PRESCOTT I was n't saying you did . Or implying it . BEN HARCOURT Fine . ABBY PRESCOTT But somehow , as usual , you were able to turn something about me into a thing about you . BEN HARCOURT What ? When ? ABBY PRESCOTT I said you should ask me if I like doing it with you . Not that you had a problem per se . BEN HARCOURT Why would n't you like doing it with me ? ABBY PRESCOTT That 's not what I BEN HARCOURT We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not get you ! What the hell are we even ABBY PRESCOTT Do n't worry , Ben , I like screwing you just fine . BEN HARCOURT Oh . ABBY PRESCOTT See , no worries p. 49 BEN HARCOURT I did n't think so . That there was a problem , I mean . ABBY PRESCOTT I did n't say there was n't a problem . BEN HARCOURT Well then , I What do n't you like ? ABBY PRESCOTT The rest . BEN HARCOURT What " rest " ? There is no other . ( Beat . ) You mean , like , oral ? ABBY PRESCOTT No ! God , you 're like a twelve-year-old . BEN HARCOURT Well , I 'm missing something . ABBY PRESCOTT I know . Me too . BEN HARCOURT No , I mean , you 're just going in loops here , and I 'm ABBY PRESCOTT Ben , come on , you 're a goddamn grown-up ! Stop it . ( Beat . ) I do n't like what we 've been doing . BEN HARCOURT Oh . You mean the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not telling people about us . ABBY PRESCOTT No , not even that . I mean , I do n't love it , not at all , but I 'm whatever about it I 'm talking about the rest . Other stuff . BEN HARCOURT Abby , what ? Shit , I do n't p. 50 ABBY PRESCOTT Ben , God , you can be thick . It 's sexual harassment , you know that . BEN HARCOURT No , it 's not . ABBY PRESCOTT Yes , it is . Yes . Very much so . BEN HARCOURT That 's not , no , it 's consensual , what we 've got , it 's ABBY PRESCOTT Does n't matter , Ben , it does n't . How many times have you gone to those seminars and shit ? ! I mean a million . BEN HARCOURT I do n't listen at those things , do you ? ABBY PRESCOTT As a matter of fact , yeah , I do . I 'm usually the one giving them , remember ? BEN HARCOURT That 's true . ABBY PRESCOTT And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an " empowered workspace , " and all the while I 'm fucking one of my employees , how do you think I feel ? Huh ? BEN HARCOURT I do n't know clever ? ABBY PRESCOTT No , Ben , not clever I feel like shit . Like a fucking Judas , and just plain awful . All right ? That 's how . ( Beat . ) You do n't think I 've fretted over promoting you , or not promoting you , or whatever the hell I see fit ? ( Beat . ) Every second of every day since we 've been together I 've worried about this . Us . Worried myself sick if we 're talking in the hall too long or we kiss at a restaurant or I lean over and grab your knee under some conference table in San Diego  --  I may like it , usually feels great while we 're doing it , but something inside me , up inside me somewhere , is screaming , " You fucking idiot ! You stupid needy bitch " After everything I 've worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get where I am to blow it all on a piece of ass . p. 51 BEN HARCOURT I 'm a piece of ass ? ABBY PRESCOTT Sometimes , yeah , Ben you are . BEN HARCOURT Oh . ABBY PRESCOTT I 'm sorry , but BEN HARCOURT No , I mean , that 's how you think of this ? ABBY PRESCOTT On occasion . ( Beat . ) At first , maybe , yes , I did . BEN thinks about this a moment , considering the thought . He nods . BEN HARCOURT Well , I 'm fine with that . ABBY PRESCOTT You are ? BEN HARCOURT Absolutely . Not that I only think of you in that way , but a lot of the time , yeah you 're basically a nice lay . True , a lay that I respect and work for and enjoy taking out for a Coney dog &amp; fries ABBY PRESCOTT Charming BEN HARCOURT It 's true . I mean , I like being with you , want to spend our lives together , but sure , I 've said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the boss , but ol ' Abby 's simply one hell of a sweet fuck . " ABBY PRESCOTT See ? BEN HARCOURT What ? p. 52 ABBY PRESCOTT You just did the same thing . BEN HARCOURT What thing ? / no ABBY PRESCOTT The " boss " thing . You relate to us in terms of who we are at work , our positions / You just did ! BEN HARCOURT " Listen , sister , the only position I relate to you in is when you 're facedown on this rug , faux or not " / No I 'm playing ! ABBY PRESCOTT Oh really ? / You sure it 's not a control issue ? BEN HARCOURT Yes ! ( Beat . ) I do n't care if you 're my project director or a waitress at the corner deli I like you for you . ABBY PRESCOTT Then why do we always do it from behind ? BEN HARCOURT We do n't . ABBY PRESCOTT Always . From the first day since . All fours , facedown , never looking me in the eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . ABBY PRESCOTT You go down on me occasionally , that 's true because you think you 're good at it . / You 're not , by the way , for the record . Good . You 're okay , not terrible , but by no means out-standing. p. 53 BEN HARCOURT No , I enjoy / Wow , let ' er rip while we 're ABBY PRESCOTT And you 'll let me give you head . Which I 'm free to do any which way I like standing , sitting , on a train , in a plane BEN HARCOURT We 've never ABBY PRESCOTT On a boat , with a goat It 's like I 'm fucking Dr. Seuss ! BEN HARCOURT Abby this is so out of whack that I ca n't even ABBY PRESCOTT But you never even glance at me , Ben , when we 're making love . Not ever . ( Beat . ) Why is that ? BEN HARCOURT So , is this something what , you 've just been lying in wait for the right ? ABBY PRESCOTT Yeah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see ABBY PRESCOTT You do n't think it 's just a little bit of " I 'm gon na let the ol ' gal have it for getting that promotion over me " ? Not just a touch of that ? BEN HARCOURT No . I do n't . ABBY PRESCOTT Sure ? I mean , you barely used to acknowledge me when you first started at our office not even a smile in the morning , we 're on the elevator together . / We had that whole competitive thing going right off the bat , do n't say we didn't. p. 54 BEN HARCOURT I was new , that 's no big / Maybe , yeah , maybe so , but ABBY PRESCOTT But then I get a boost , right , I snag the position we 've both been gunning for , and bang , like , a month later , you 're suddenly jockeying for private dinners out and discussions after work . BEN HARCOURT You 're my boss ! What the hell ABBY PRESCOTT I 'm just saying , your timing , like yesterday , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I fell for you , it 's not a crime . ABBY PRESCOTT Ahh , actually , in some states it is you 're married . BEN HARCOURT Yeah , well ABBY PRESCOTT And then we got together  --  on that retreat the first time , remember ? Up in Connecticut  --  and that was pretty much the last moment you looked me fully in the face . Three years ago BEN HARCOURT This is crazy . ABBY PRESCOTT I know . I know it is . BEN HARCOURT I want to be with you together , with you , for the rest of my life . Now , if that 's p. 55 ABBY PRESCOTT I 'm not talking about that , I 'm BEN HARCOURT If you wan na find some way to ruin this , that 's fine . Go ahead . ABBY stops for a moment and studies BEN . Watches to see if his body betrays him at all . It does n't . ABBY PRESCOTT It just makes a girl wonder . BEN HARCOURT Fine . If you wan na fine . Missionary it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably just guilt or whatever . The " doggie-style " thing ABBY PRESCOTT Guilt ? / Not Oedipal , I hope . BEN HARCOURT Yeah , you know / NO ! I mean about cheating and stuff Maybe it 's just hard to look you in the face or , God , I du n no . ABBY PRESCOTT Hell , Ben , I feel guilty . Every moment . But I still would n't mind making eye contact once a week . BEN HARCOURT It just hurts sometimes . That 's all . ABBY PRESCOTT Then do n't do it . It 's a pretty simple equation . BEN HARCOURT Abby ABBY PRESCOTT Seriously . BEN HARCOURT Why 're we even ? p. 56 ABBY PRESCOTT I mean it . If you feel so " not good , " then stop putting your thing in me and go the hell away / Or at least switch your phone on and take your wife 's call . BEN HARCOURT That 's not what I 'm / Awww , screw this . ABBY PRESCOTT Let ' em know you 're alive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loft and do the right thing , I mean , shit ! ! BEN HARCOURT I do n't want that ! / I want you ! ! ABBY PRESCOTT Oh . BEN HARCOURT I want you , Abby that 's what I want . They both come to a stop and stare at each other , having let out far more than they expected to . Silence . The sound of sirens out there somewhere . ABBY PRESCOTT Then why do n't you say that every few days , just so I 'm in on it . Okay ? BEN HARCOURT Yeah , sorry , I should . ( Beat . ) I do want you , though I do . ABBY PRESCOTT I 'm glad . BEN HARCOURT And I do n't expect anything for it or care who knows it or will ever use it against you I just-want-you . That 's all . ( Beat . ) By the way , I enjoy having sex from behind . It feels nice and , like , intimate . I love being with you like that . I do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's very thanks . ( Beat . ) It 's funny , I probably should n't even go there , but  --  it 's comical , almost almost comical the things you can imagine while you 're making love that way . Facedown . Turned away from a person . It is to me , anyway . The ideas , or images , or , you know , just stuff that goes through your head if you do it that way for too long . Ha ! Wow , it 's I do n't know . Just funny . BEN HARCOURT What do you mean ? Like like what ? ABBY PRESCOTT Oh , just things . Things that you 'd never expect , or be prepared for , or anything ; visions that will just suddenly appear as you 're kneeling there . Doing it . Having it done to you . ' Cause that 's what it 's like when you have sex that way all the time , like it 's being done to you . That it really does n't matter to the person back there who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a backside  --  is there and available and willing . And so a lot of the time when you 're going at it , my mind has just drifted off and I 'll think such crazy thoughts sometimes fantasies , like it 's somebody else , a lover I 've taken , or that I 'm being attacked , jumped in an alleyway by some person or I 'll just make lists , " to do " lists for work or shopping or whatnot . I can remember figuring out all my Christmas ideas one night in Orlando at the Hyatt there , during one of our little on the carpet , as I recall do you remember that night ? We had those adjoining suites that was a nice conference . In fact , that might 've been where I first noticed your particular bent for well , you know . My back porch . p. 58 BEN HARCOURT Abby why do n't we just ABBY PRESCOTT But most of the time I just imagine that it 's your wife . Lately that 's the thought that I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's your sweet little Mrs. from the suburbs behind me with one of those , umm , things  --  those , like , strappy things that you buy at sex shops  --  and she 's just going to town on me . Banging away for hours because of what I 've done to her life , and you know what ? I let her . I let her do it , because somewhere inside I feel like I probably deserve it , it 's true and when I think about it , when I stop and really take it in for a moment , it does n't actually feel that much different than when we do it . Honestly . I mean , in some ways , who better ? She knows what you do it like , the speed , rhythm , all that . Unless you do it with her all pretty and tender and who knows what . Do you ? No , probably not she 's probably read the ol ' mattress tag more times than even me , God bless ' er . ( Beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Hell is , in the end . All of your wrongful shit played out there in front of you while you 're being pumped from behind by someone you 've hurt . That you 've screwed over in life . Or worse , worse still some person who does n't really love you anymore . No one to ever look at again , make contact with . Just you being fucked as your life splashes out across this big headboard in the Devil 's bedroom . Maybe . Even if that 's not it , even if Hell is all fire and sulfur and that sort of thing , it could n't be much worse than that . p. 59 BEN HARCOURT No , I s'ppose not . Sirens in the distance . ABBY goes to a window . ABBY PRESCOTT So what do you think they 'll say about you ? BEN HARCOURT Huh ? ABBY PRESCOTT You know , at the wake or whatever it is that your people do . I mean , between the potato salad and cold meats , what kind of speeches do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HARCOURT About me ? ABBY PRESCOTT Yes . BEN HARCOURT I du n no . ABBY PRESCOTT Oh come on BEN HARCOURT Seriously , no , I do n't wan na do that . ABBY PRESCOTT We 're just imagining BEN HARCOURT Yeah , but it 's creepy . That is spooky shit , and I do n't wan na think about it ABBY PRESCOTT What do you care , you 're dead . ( She smiles . ) I bet they get you a nice big stone . With the metal plaque and whatnot . You said your wife 's good at that kind of thing . BEN HARCOURT No , I did n't . ABBY PRESCOTT Yes , you said / still p. 60 BEN HARCOURT I said decorating . / Matching up towels and wallpaper and shit , not funerals . ABBY PRESCOTT Same idea , just permanent . BEN HARCOURT Whatever . ABBY PRESCOTT Hell , maybe the company 'll pay for it . Least they can do . BEN HARCOURT Right . ABBY PRESCOTT After losing one so young and gifted BEN HARCOURT Okay , okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an angel perched up on it maybe a little flame thing , even . That 'd be cute It 's probably a tax write-off , too . BEN HARCOURT You know , Abby , you 're ABBY PRESCOTT What 'll it say ?  --  hmm ?  --  your little marker  --  do you think ? BEN HARCOURT What do you mean ? ABBY PRESCOTT Your epitaph . I mean , if you could write it . I 'm sure it 'll have the " loving husband , father , brother " bullshit , no doubt ; but if it was you out there with the chisel , what would you put ? BEN starts to say something , then stops . Considers . Then : p. 61 BEN HARCOURT " He was okay . " / Yeah ABBY PRESCOTT " Okay " ? / Why on earth would you ? BEN HARCOURT Because " okay " is not such a bad thing . It 's pretty fucking underrated , actually . ABBY PRESCOTT Your big chance to sound good and you go with " okay . " Wow . BEN HARCOURT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people out there , right now , who would like to be just " okay . " Would love it . It 's I 'm sick of the ups and downs , you know greatest guy on earth when the going 's good and a son-of-a-ditch when I run through a yellow light . You grab the last thing of orange juice in Waldbaum 's and somebody hates you for the next six hours The wife wonders how the fuck she ever got mixed up with a prick like you when , in college , you were the guy whose smile used to make her cry herself to sleep . Just you smiling at her could do that , she wanted you so bady . So , you know , fuck it . " He was okay " sounds pretty damn good to me . ABBY PRESCOTT Well , Ben , if it 's any consolation you 're " okay " by me . I mean that . / More than okay . BEN HARCOURT Thanks . / I appreciate that . ( He reaches over and kisses ABBY lightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost soft , for a moment . ) Thanks . ( Beat . ) That 's not what I meant before , anyway . p. 62 ABBY PRESCOTT About what ? / No BEN HARCOURT You know / The " steel trap " thing . ABBY PRESCOTT Oh . Then what were you saying ? BEN HARCOURT I 'm saying that I do n't know . I do n't know what I 'm saying exactly , but not that . ABBY PRESCOTT Okay , good , just so long as it 's clear as mud . BEN HARCOURT I was never saying do n't tell anyone . You know I would n't tell you that . I just we had to be adult about this . ABBY PRESCOTT " Adult " ? BEN HARCOURT You know , grown-up . I mean ABBY PRESCOTT I 'm in my forties . I think that qualifies BEN HARCOURT I do n't mean Christ , you pounce on every word ! ABBY PRESCOTT Well BEN HARCOURT I did n't not tell people because I was embarrassed or trying to lead two lives or whatnot I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PRESCOTT Okay . If that 's what it was , then okay . BEN HARCOURT It was . We had to take it easy before , that 's all . p. 63 ABBY PRESCOTT I get it . All right . BEN HARCOURT But now it 's ABBY PRESCOTT fine . Right ? Because you 're passed on . BEN HARCOURT Exactly ( Almost a smile . ) I am . ABBY PRESCOTT You and the six thousand other heroes . BEN HARCOURT Come on . ABBY PRESCOTT Well , I 'm sure a few of them are , anyway . BEN HARCOURT Do n't bring that up again , okay , not the ABBY PRESCOTT What ? BEN HARCOURT The " hero " thing . I feel shitty enough . ABBY PRESCOTT Yeah ? Really ? ( Beat . ) I 'm not sure you do . Not as shitty as they feel , anyway . BEN HARCOURT Who ? ABBY PRESCOTT Whoever . The victims . Their families . No , I think you 're down the list a bit , Ben way the heck down there . BEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ABBY PRESCOTT Dead . p. 64 BEN HARCOURT Whatever . ABBY PRESCOTT Exactly . Whatever . ( Beat . ) That 's the position this puts me in six thousand people are dead , killed , some of them our associates , and my entire response is " Oh well , whatever at least now we can sneak off to the Bahamas . " ( Harsh laugh . ) That 's not very nice . BEN HARCOURT I 'm not Who says you ca n't mourn ? Huh ? ABBY PRESCOTT Ben BEN HARCOURT I did n't say a word about that . ABBY PRESCOTT It 's your whole demeanor about the BEN HARCOURT Go down and help sift debris if you want to , or keep a can-dlelight vigil , I do n't care fuck ! ( Beat . ) How did we even get on this ? ABBY PRESCOTT I think I accidentally started to feel something for a moment . Sorry . BEN HARCOURT Come on , that 's bullshit . That 's total ABBY PRESCOTT Wo n't happen again . I promise . BEN HARCOURT Fuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I know a lot more people that work down there than you do . Tons more . p. 65 ABBY PRESCOTT As in " tons " of rubble ? BEN HARCOURT STOP ! Will you ? God ( Beat . ) I used to work out of that office , if you recall . I did . For years . And so , yeah , I got a bunch of faces in my head right now Why the hell do you think I 've been sitting here like a fucking pothead on the edge of the loveseat , staring into space for a day ? Huh ? ABBY PRESCOTT I do n't know . BEN HARCOURT Well , that 's why . ABBY PRESCOTT Oh . BEN HARCOURT All right ? People I 've talked to , had coffee with I mean , all those guys from maintenance . ABBY PRESCOTT So all this time you 've been thinking about these people that you met down there over the years . Like , in the elevator , or at some little sandwich place people like that ? BEN HARCOURT Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought maybe you were thinking about us BEN HARCOURT No . I mean , yeah , I was , yes , but ABBY PRESCOTT and the family you 're ditching maybe all the hope they 're probably pinning on the fact that you do n't really work in that office anymore . I mean , the prayers they 're sending out for you right now I figured you were taking all that in ! Shit , silly me. p. 66 BEN HARCOURT Abby you just asked me how I ABBY PRESCOTT Maybe you should 've had one of the guys from maintenance bring you over some fucking cheese . BEN HARCOURT That is so ABBY PRESCOTT I 'm serious ! BEN HARCOURT The guys from maintenance are probably all dead ! ABBY PRESCOTT Oh , I 'm sure some of them were cheating on their wives , you just need to call around ! ! Suddenly ABBY 'S buzzer rings . She and BEN freeze as it rings again . Before she goes to it , BEN gestures to her and she approaches the door . She hesitates , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PRESCOTT It was my neighbor BEN HARCOURT Oh . ABBY PRESCOTT One floor down , actually . BEN HARCOURT Okay . ABBY PRESCOTT She needs milk . For her kids . BEN HARCOURT Ummm . ABBY PRESCOTT The stores are out . That 's what she says . BEN HARCOURT All right , so , we could , ahh p. 67 ABBY PRESCOTT Would you mind running up to the D'Agostinos ? ( BEN looks at her , unsure how to take this . ) Kidding . I have the rest of that half gallon . ABBY grabs the milk out of the fridge and heads back to the door . Opens it and disappears for a moment . BEN stays hidden . ABBY PRESCOTT Her husband works down there . BEN HARCOURT He does ? ABBY PRESCOTT Yes . I think so . I mean , I do n't know right down there , but somewhere in the area . BEN HARCOURT Oh . ( Beat . ) Did she say if ? ABBY PRESCOTT No . And I did n't ask . She wanted milk and I gave it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? BEN HARCOURT Of course . ABBY PRESCOTT Good . BEN HARCOURT I do n't even like 2 percent ABBY smirks at this and goes to the bathroom . Shuts the door . Water runs . BEN goes to a chair and sits . Plays with his phone . Turns it on . It rings almost immediately . He shuts it off and waits . ABBY reenters . ABBY PRESCOTT What was that ? p. 68 BEN HARCOURT What ? ABBY PRESCOTT Just now . Did I hear your BEN HARCOURT What ? ABBY PRESCOTT phone ? BEN HARCOURT No . ABBY PRESCOTT I did n't ? BEN HARCOURT Uh-uh . I was , you know , fiddling with it , but it did n't ring. / I mean , the message thing went off , but ABBY PRESCOTT Oh . / And who was it ? BEN HARCOURT I do n't know . I did n't see or check , I mean . ABBY PRESCOTT Not curious ? BEN HARCOURT No , I 'll I can find out later . / Check ' em at some other ABBY PRESCOTT Sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I go out to get you more cheese or something . When it 's safe . BEN HARCOURT Oh shit . ABBY PRESCOTT That 'd be a good time to do it . BEN HARCOURT Okay , I know that means something . Obviously that means something or you would n't have said it so , go ahead . p. 69 ABBY PRESCOTT I 'm saying , pretty straightforwardly , that in the three years that we 've been together I ca n't recall you taking a phone call or listening to a message in front of me . I can't. / Not a personal one , anyway . BEN HARCOURT I have , too / That 's not ABBY PRESCOTT Yes , it is . It 's completely true . BEN HARCOURT No , I 've no . ABBY PRESCOTT Now , why do you think that is ? ( Beat . ) Huh ? BEN HARCOURT Because I do n't / maybe I did n't wan na hurt you . ABBY PRESCOTT What ? / Hurt me ? How ? BEN HARCOURT You know ABBY PRESCOTT No . BEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . The kids and , you know , the way we talk to each other , and all that kind of thing . ABBY PRESCOTT Oh . BEN HARCOURT I 've been sparing you that . ABBY PRESCOTT Please BEN HARCOURT I have . ABBY PRESCOTT Well , do n't , all right ? Do me a favor / I want the whole " you " or not at all . p. 70 BEN HARCOURT Fine . / What , you wan na hear every little ? ABBY PRESCOTT No , not " every , " just once ! One time where you stand in front of me so I know what 's coming out of your phone now is the same shit you 're telling me ten minutes later . BEN HARCOURT Oh God ABBY PRESCOTT That 'd be a real treat . BEN HARCOURT I mean , you 're just ranting here , seriously . ABBY PRESCOTT I am not ranting ! BEN HARCOURT Fuck , listen to yourself ! ABBY PRESCOTT I can do ranting , believe me , I can , but this is not it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goddamn phone call . ABBY PRESCOTT It 's not the call , Ben . It 's not that . BEN HARCOURT Then what ? ABBY PRESCOTT It 's trust ! And openness ! Your wanting to share everything with me It 's having the desire to do that ! I 'd probably listen to five minutes of your family drivel and pass out from boredom , but it 's in the asking . BEN HARCOURT I 'm sorry I did n't know . p. 71 ABBY PRESCOTT And that 's bullshit right there , that 's what that is . It is because I 've said this a thousand times , almost literally a thousand . No Secrets . / You can keep ' em from her but not from me , otherwise I might as well be her ! Do n't you get that ? BEN HARCOURT It 's not a secret / It 's just a private phone call . ABBY PRESCOTT " Private " makes it secret ! / I do n't care ! ! BEN HARCOURT With a child ! ! / But all I 'm doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter because once you slip into the bathroom or turn on the fan or step back out onto the sidewalk , you might as well be I du n no Guy Burgess . BEN HARCOURT Who ? ABBY PRESCOTT Nothing shit it 's not BEN HARCOURT The guy who wrote Clockwork Orange ? / What the hell does he have to do with ? ABBY PRESCOTT No / That 's Anthony Burgess ! Your lit course did n't stick so good , did it ? BEN HARCOURT Well , I got the last name right , I just did n't ABBY PRESCOTT Guy Burgess was a spy , an English spy who went over to the Soviets he and some friends . In the fifties . p. 72 BEN HARCOURT Okay , I 'm lost , but whatever ABBY PRESCOTT Jesus , Ben , I 'm saying it still applies if you 're just reading to your daughters about The Gingerbread Man ! You sneak off and make a call , always keep me out the mind 's gon na wander . BEN HARCOURT I 'm sorry . I thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HARCOURT I did ! I figured you did n't need to be constantly reminded of the situation . ABBY PRESCOTT I 've never known what the situation was , because of the way you live your life ! BEN HARCOURT Why is it some federal thing if I wan na make a call in my in the quiet of my own ABBY PRESCOTT That 's okay , calling 's okay , but you ca n't BEN HARCOURT I 'm a private person , so what ? ! ABBY PRESCOTT Well then , do n't invite somebody in and ask them to hand over their life if you ca n't do the same fucking thing ! BEN HARCOURT Good God ! And what " life " am I asking for , huh ? ABBY PRESCOTT Ben p. 73 BEN HARCOURT No , I mean it , let 's not get completely off the ABBY PRESCOTT Look at us ! ! Look at the current state of things and tell me I do n't need to give up my life . BEN HARCOURT Fuck , you are really on a tear , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ABBY PRESCOTT Ben , what 're we actually talking about here ? You know , we keep dancing around it , but let 's say it , let 's just put the thing out there and see what we 've got . BEN HARCOURT Whatever . If you need to go ahead . ABBY PRESCOTT All right . ( Beat . ) This " meal ticket " of ours tell me what that is exactly . BEN HARCOURT You know what it 's ABBY PRESCOTT Just say it . For me. / Please . BEN HARCOURT This is stupid / Fine .

Just say that 's what p. 74 BEN HARCOURT Not run ! We do n't have to I mean , we ca n't even get out of town right now , so it 's not exactly running . ABBY PRESCOTT You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beat . ) Okay , so , yes , leave . Escape . Get away from this city and be with each other for the rest of our lives . ABBY PRESCOTT Or , as they used to call it " run . " BEN HARCOURT Yeah . We could run . ABBY PRESCOTT Good . You said it . Just so it 's been said . BEN HARCOURT Do n't you want to ? ABBY PRESCOTT More than anything / Since the day I met you . BEN HARCOURT So do I ! / Well , now we can . ABBY PRESCOTT We could 've before . Any day before this , we could have . BEN HARCOURT But now we can do it clean , you know , without any kind of hassle or strings on us . ABBY PRESCOTT Was that the problem ? Strings ? BEN HARCOURT Of course ! Jesus my wife , a fucking mortgage All the shit that would 've killed us , this thing we have . p. 75 ABBY PRESCOTT A mortgage would 've " killed " us ? BEN HARCOURT No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lied to everyone we know , every minute of our time together for this long because of a fucking house payment ? Tell me that 's not true . BEN HARCOURT She would 've buried me in a divorce , you know that ! ABBY PRESCOTT So what ? I would 've uncovered you . BEN HARCOURT No , no I do n't want that . ABBY PRESCOTT What , then , Ben ? What do you want ? BEN HARCOURT You . I 've told you that . ABBY PRESCOTT Just so long as you do n't have to make a scene . BEN HARCOURT No , but I no . ABBY PRESCOTT As long as it could be done without causing a stink . Without you having to sully yourself . BEN HARCOURT That 's not what I 'm ABBY PRESCOTT Tell the truth , Ben ! BEN HARCOURT Maybe I was thinking about my kids ! Okay ? ! / I 'm not using them ! p. 76 ABBY PRESCOTT No , do n't use them to / Do n't do that ! BEN HARCOURT You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To , to imagine them waiting and ABBY PRESCOTT No , I do n't , but BEN HARCOURT You have no fucking IDEA ! ABBY PRESCOTT Ben , I know I do n't , but I still BEN HARCOURT Maybe if you 'd stop for a second , quit chewing your way up the corporate rungs there like a plague of fucking locusts and have yourself one then , just possibly , you 'll know ! ! / Okay , then . ABBY starts to retort , but just shakes her head , turns away . BEN does n't pursue her on this , having said more than he wished to . ABBY PRESCOTT All right . / I accept that . ( Beat . ) ' S that true ? BEN HARCOURT What ? ABBY PRESCOTT That you were protecting them ? Is it ? Tell me . BEN thinks for a moment before he speaks . He catches himself once before saying anything . ABBY studies him . BEN HARCOURT No. not completely . Or her or you or anybody else . p. 77 ABBY PRESCOTT Careful , Ben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BEN HARCOURT It 's true . ( Beat . ) I was protecting me How 's that ? ABBY PRESCOTT I like that just fine . BEN HARCOURT Yeah ? ABBY PRESCOTT If you 're going to come clean , I like it a lot . BEN HARCOURT I wanted this to work out , I did . For everybody , yes , but most of all for me . ( Beat . ) There , better ? Clean ABBY PRESCOTT We could 've worked anything out . At any point . BEN HARCOURT No , we could n't I do n't think we could . ABBY PRESCOTT Why ? BEN HARCOURT Because I was n't strong enough . ( Beat . ) But now I am. / I mean it , now I 'm ready . ABBY PRESCOTT Yeah ? / You 're sure ? BEN HARCOURT So totally sure ABBY PRESCOTT ' Kay . ( Beat . ) I 'm glad . BEN HARCOURT Me too . p. 78 ABBY PRESCOTT And what you 're asking  --  I 'm just saying it so that there 's no question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for us to hide out in my house until it 's safe , right ? I mean , till the city gets itself back in gear , and then we would BEN HARCOURT Just , like , until the roads are open , you know , until we can drive ourselves out of ABBY PRESCOTT Right , right , that 's what I mean stay here until we can get in the Saab and take off . Drive to another state , an airport somewhere , and slip away while everybody else  --  not just your family , but friends , the company  --  all the people around you , really , can have this just major outpouring of grief in your honor something like that ? BEN HARCOURT Yeah . That 's the Reader 's Digest version , but yes . ABBY PRESCOTT Okay , that 's what I thought . BEN HARCOURT It 's soooo easy really . ABBY PRESCOTT And my job  --  I should just , what ? Call in with a migraine for a few weeks , or ? BEN HARCOURT I think so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sick days . But if you use those first , then you can p. 79 ABBY PRESCOTT Eventually , though , once I do the whole " I 'm too devastated to come back to work " thing , then what ? BEN HARCOURT You quit , right ? Is n't that what we ? ABBY PRESCOTT I quit . Just up and resign . BEN HARCOURT It 's what we already discussed . Last night . ABBY PRESCOTT I know , I guess I just never really heard the whole thing before , not laid out like this . ( Beat . ) So , I give up my position BEN HARCOURT Yes . I think a transfer 's " iffy , " I do ( Beat . ) But you can take a similar position with another company  --  you were considering that place in Flagstaff , like , what , a year ago ?  --  and we set up house . I get myself a license , a credit card or two , the whole deal . ( Beat . ) Get back into sales , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes . ABBY PRESCOTT Like the Witness Protection Program , or something . Right ? BEN HARCOURT Sorta . You can even pick out my new name ABBY PRESCOTT Huh . ( Beat . ) And my seniority with work now ? My pension plan and all the things I 've worked toward , I should just p. 80 BEN HARCOURT I know , Abby , I 'm aware of the cost here We 're both giving up a lot . ABBY PRESCOTT What 're you giving up again ? Just remind me . BEN HARCOURT My family ! Shit , I mean ABBY PRESCOTT I thought you wanted to give them up . BEN HARCOURT I do , I do want to , but not the girls . Not that . / Because ! Jesus , I want to get out of all the other you know ABBY PRESCOTT Then why do it ? / Ahh , yes , the " other " stuff BEN sits up at this , eager to make his point . ABBY watches him . BEN HARCOURT You think I like the idea of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Well , I do n't but it 's a hell of a lot better this way , letting ' em think whatever happened , okay , rather than dragging them through court for a year and fighting over who gets which Barbie , and for how long , and at which designated location ! ( Beat . ) This is better as hard and horrible as it 's gon na be , it 's still better . ABBY PRESCOTT You 'll never be able to see them . You understand that , do n't you ? Not ever again . p. 81 BEN HARCOURT Yes . ABBY PRESCOTT No Disney , no proms , no walking down the aisle BEN HARCOURT I GET IT ! Fuck you think I did n't consider all that ? Weigh it in ? / Well , I did . ABBY PRESCOTT I 'm just saying / All right , then . Okay . ( Beat . ) Plus , you die a hero right ? BEN HARCOURT Shit , Abby , that 's not fair ! Fuck ! ! ( Beat . ) It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! And it fell right in our laps . ABBY PRESCOTT You 're sure ? / I know , but BEN HARCOURT It absolutely is ! This way we completely dodge around all the shit that I 'd have to wade through all the , you know . ABBY PRESCOTT Yeah , that messy shit , like sitting your wife down and telling her honestly what you want . Shit like that ? BEN HARCOURT Fuck , fine If this is gon na turn into one of your ABBY PRESCOTT I 'm just asking ! Is that what it basically comes down to ? I can cash in my life and go on the lam with you  --  because this is basically illegal , fyi , it is  --  I do that for you just so you can miss out on the discomfort of having to break it to your one-time prom queen that she does n't turn you on anymore ? p. 82 BEN HARCOURT Yes . / I 'm asking you to do that . ABBY PRESCOTT Okay . / Just so we 've said it . BEN HARCOURT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just so truth reared its ugly head here one time today . BEN HARCOURT I am begging you to walk away to leave a job that I 've heard you bitch and moan about for the three years we 've been together . To just pick up and leave this co-op that you tell me you hate ' cause it 's in the wrong section of town now I 'm asking you to show me you love me by dumping the lifestyle that I hear you crying about at , like , 2:30 in the morning , when I 'm lucky enough to be around you at 2:30 in the morning , which is maybe once a month ! I am asking you to throw this mediocre , less than desirable single life of yours out the fucking window and make a dash for the border with me . ( Beat . ) Do it , Abby we can do this . ABBY PRESCOTT I know we can . ( Beat . ) And do you love me ? BEN HARCOURT Abby of course . You know that , I yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just saying it . p. 83 BEN HARCOURT I do !

BEN is suddenly up and crosses to ABBY . He takes her into his arms and holds her . She starts to resist , but he is too strong . She slowly melts into a hug that leads to a hungry , naked kiss . She begins to cry . A long silence between them . BEN HARCOURT I do . Love you . Better ? ABBY PRESCOTT Much . BEN HARCOURT Good . ABBY PRESCOTT Very . BEN HARCOURT I agree . And that 's what all this is about . ABBY PRESCOTT What ? BEN HARCOURT Making things very good . For us . ( A smile , finally , between them . BEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dusting his clothes off and heading toward the bathroom door . ) I think I 'm gon na take a shower , and then we can start to p. 84 ABBY PRESCOTT Ben . BEN HARCOURT Yeah ? ABBY PRESCOTT Let me ask you something . BEN HARCOURT What , honey ? ABBY PRESCOTT Just a theoretical thing , so do n't get all BEN HARCOURT No , go ahead . What ?

( Beat . ) Why 're you so ? ABBY PRESCOTT Then make the call . BEN stops with the door half open . Turns slowly to face ABBY . She does n't waver . BEN HARCOURT What ? ABBY PRESCOTT The call you were going to make . Yesterday , before all this . BEN HARCOURT Huh ? ABBY PRESCOTT I can not do this . This " ride the rails " thing with you . ( Beat . ) If we 're going to make it , you and me , I mean then you need to call your wife and kids and let them know what 's going on . Tell them the truth . BEN HARCOURT Oh . So this was all a what , trick ? Some kind of ABBY PRESCOTT No , not a trick .

ABBY PRESCOTT You ca n't dictate how life is supposed to BEN HARCOURT Yeah , I could In this one instance , I could 've ! ( Beat . ) We had no chance here A day ago , we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had something special . Now we 've got a chance to actually make it that . Special ABBY PRESCOTT It was n't special ? BEN HARCOURT It was an affair , Abby , fuck , ca n't we just be ? p. 87 ABBY PRESCOTT It was special to me . BEN HARCOURT Of course it was " special , " that 's the wrong word . I just mean that it was common , regular . It happens . But this thing this disaster makes what we 're doing possible . ABBY PRESCOTT I see Now I see . BEN HARCOURT All we have to do is walk away , Abby ! Not run just walk . Walk off into the sunset . ABBY PRESCOTT All right . Okay . Duly noted . ( Beat . ) But after you make the call . BEN HARCOURT Shit Abby / Do n't ask me to ABBY PRESCOTT I need you to do that for me. / Will you ? Ben ? BEN HARCOURT I ca n't / oh God ABBY PRESCOTT Please / Ben , please for me Please . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ABBY PRESCOTT Thank you . BEN HARCOURT I will . ( Beat . ) You , umm , you want me to what , make the call that I was gon na make yesterday , right ? The call I said I was going to make before this all this happened . p. 88 ABBY PRESCOTT That 's what I want . Yes . BEN HARCOURT All right , Abby , I 'll do that . BEN crosses back to the couch and sits , rubbing his eyes . Pulls his cell phone out of his pocket and switches it on . ABBY starts across the room . ABBY PRESCOTT I 'll give you your privacy . BEN HARCOURT No , you do n't have to . ABBY PRESCOTT It 's okay , you should have time to / It 's fine . BEN HARCOURT I want you to hear this , Abby . / ABBY ! ( ABBY stops and looks at him . ) You need to hear this Go ahead , take a seat . ABBY crosses back toward the kitchen and sits on the edge of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then dials a number and waits . After a moment , Abby 's phone begins to ring . She looks up , startled , and mimes to BEN : " What should I do ? " She starts to panic , but BEN motions for her to take the call . ABBY PRESCOTT Hello ? BEN HARCOURT Hi . ABBY PRESCOTT Ben ? Why 're you ? BEN HARCOURT Just listen . Okay ? Just listen to me . ( Beat . ) So this was the call I was going to make yesterday . p. 89 ABBY PRESCOTT No , no , I do n't want you to pretend with me , I want you to call them and BEN HARCOURT Abby , shut the fuck up and listen ! I was going to call you yesterday , not them . I was gon na make this call on my way to work , and then I thought , What the hell , it 's only a few blocks over , I 'll stop in and talk to her . Tell her face-to-face . Be brave , like she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Beat . ) I was n't gon na phone home , Abby , I ca n't do that . You can call my wife , spill your guts if you want to , but I 'll never be able to ca n't do that . ( Beat . ) That 's why all this suddenly seemed so logical , like the only thing possible . And I wanted it . God , I did ! But now Look , I think you 're great , and we 've had , umm , the most amazing ABBY PRESCOTT Ben do n't . BEN HARCOURT No , I promised you I 'd make a call , and this is it . I 'm calling to tell you I ca n't do this anymore , I 'm tired of dodging and hiding and all the , just , bad shit I 've done so effortlessly since we met . If you 'd taken this meal ticket of ours , then great . I 'd 've worked in a fucking lumberyard the rest of my days to be with you , but if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , purge all my sins for some un-fucking-fathomable reason I mean , if I 'm publicly forced to choose between those little girls ' hearts and your thighs , well then , there 's just not much question . ( Beat . ) Sorry , Abby , I 'm really very I do n't know . Just sorry . G'bye . BEN clicks off the call . After a moment , his cell phone begins ringing and continues while they sit staring at each other . ABBY slowly hangs up . BEN finally snaps his phone shut . p. 90 ABBY PRESCOTT Goodbye . ( Beat . ) So you were never going to call your ? And my little " pick-me-up , " to encourage you , that was ? Hmm , what ? A last suck for good luck ? ( She slowly goes over to her things and begins to suit up . Coat , hat , scarf , etc . ) BEN HARCOURT What 're you doing ? ABBY PRESCOTT Going to get some more cheese Kidding . I 'll go to work , I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and find out what 's happened up there see if I can something Just tell me the company line before I go . Are you gon na stick with the " hero " thing went up in the fire and all that , or are you gon na miraculously wake up in some alley and stagger back to your desk tomorrow ? We should get our stories straight . BEN HARCOURT I do n't know I do n't know what to do . ABBY PRESCOTT You call your family , or you do n't . You run for the hills , or you do n't . You come back in and work on the AmTel account with us or not . Your life 's in front of you right now , Ben but you have to choose . ( Beat . ) You already made one choice  --  me  --  so you can leave the keys on the counter or in your ficus tree or wherever and if I see you back at work , that 'll be great . It will be . ( She moves toward the door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . Uh-uh . I 'm not gon na rat you out , whatever you decide , I wo n't do that . I 'll show you some mercy more than you 've ever shown me , anyway . But I 'm not gon na give you any cash or maps or , you know , waterproof matches . I 'm not Harriet Tubman and I just do n't feel like helping . So , you 'll have to do whatever  --  you ca n't use your ATM card out there or any of that other shit , either , I mean , not if you really wan na disappear  --  but if you 're going to start over , then do it . Right now . Today . ( Beat . ) Otherwise , wash your face and go home . See your children , tell them you love them . Tell your wife , too . Because you do , you know . Love her . You must , or you 'd already be at that lumberyard in the Bahamas with me. p. 91 BEN HARCOURT Abby , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a little lost right now . ABBY PRESCOTT Yeah , me too , Ben . ( ABBY pulls her scarf up around her mouth and opens the front door . Rattles her keys . ) I am , too . BEN HARCOURT Could n't we just ? ABBY closes the door behind her , and the lock slides shut , cutting BEN off in mid-sentence . A kind of quiet falls over the room . After a long moment , BEN sits back on the couch and pulls his cell phone out of his pocket , turning it on . It rings almost immediately . BEN stares at it , turning it over in his hands . It rings and rings . Silence . Darkness .
