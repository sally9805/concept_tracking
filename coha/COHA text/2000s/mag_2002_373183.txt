With Jordan seeking his return to serve a life sentence for terror-related crimes , some observers figured Abu Qatada went underground  --  and perhaps left Britain  --  to avoid extradition . But senior European intelligence officials tell TIME that Abu Qatada is tucked away in a safe house in the north of England , where he and his family are being lodged , fed and clothed by British intelligence services .
