<p> " Man can learn nothing except by going from the known to the unknown . "  --  Claude Bernard ( 1813-1878 ) <p> Antibiotics for Ulcers <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> I have heard about an antibiotic cure for ulcers but ca n't find it anywhere in your magazine . Please publish the information again . Peggy Miller Chicago , Illinois <p> <p> Dr. Barry Marshall of Australia was a courageous young gastroenterologist when he challenged the firmly entrenched medical notion that ulcers were a result of stress . The Post was impressed with his early breakthroughs in avoiding stomach surgery by instead using antibiotics to eliminate the dangerous ulcers . <p> In 1994 , we invited Dr. Marshall and his lovely wife to Indianapolis to honor him at the Saturday Evening Post Ball . The purpose was to spread the word about his important discovery . The Indianapolis mayor and many gastroenterologists from the community came to hear about the cure . Indiana Congressman Dan Burton was there to announce that he believes Dr. Marshall deserves the Nobel Prize for his contributions to humanity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promptly cured using Marshall 's revolutionary regimen of antibiotics and PeptoBismol . ( Please refer to the letter from Paul Barber on page 85 of this issue and Post articles about the ulcer cures in the following issues : July/August 2000 , Sept. / Oct. 1994 , and May/June 1994 . If your library does n't archive past issues of the Post , please contact our archivist , Steve Pettinga . ) Today , doctors eliminate the bacteria with any one of eight similar FDA-approved treatments . <p> Dr. Marshall told us in a recent telephone interview that new research links H. pylori infection to stomach and pancreatic cancer as well as other diseases . " One study in Italy suggested that some people may have Raynaud 's disease  --  a vascular problem in the hands  --  because of something that the H. pylori bacterium is doing in their stomachs , " he said . " A number of papers have investigated cardiovascular risk and H. pylori , and although I have not seen a definitive study on the subject , I have seen people who tell me their migraine headaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Dr. Marshall is conducting a study on the accuracy of home breath tests to detect H. pylori . He and other researchers in Australia are also working on a vaccine to prevent infection with the bacterium . Sprinkle Vitamin C on Processed Meats <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> I have heard that nitrates in processed meats could be linked to cancer . What are processed meats ? <p> Processed meats include ham , bacon , pastrami , bologna , corned beef , dried beef , pickle loaf , sausages , hot dogs , and other lunchmeats . Sixty-five to 70 percent of all pork products in the United States are processed . <p> Meatpackers add nitrates to processed , smoked , or cured meats to keep them from spoiling . Nitrates , however , break down to form nitrosamines , known to cause cancer in animals and perhaps in human beings . To counteract that problem , packers then add vitamin C to the meat to delay the formation of nitrosamines . But vitamin C is n't as stable as nitrosamines , even in the best of conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that eating about two ounces of processed meat daily could increase the risk of colorectal cancer by 50 percent . If your family enjoys ham casseroles , chipped beef on toast , beans and franks , and other processed meat recipes , consider adding one-half teaspoon of vitamin C crystals per six servings of these dishes . <p> Vitamin C crystals are less expensive to purchase than capsules and can be easily mixed with fruit juice or water . Bronson Laboratories advertises 1,000 mg vitamin C capsules for about eight cents each ; 1,000 mg of crystalline C ( from the same company ) costs about four cents . Facial Blemishes <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> I have dozens of whiteheads over most of my chin , forehead , cheeks , and nose . These whiteheads do not become inflamed or turn red . I am a 73-year-old woman . Can you help me ? M.E.E . Clinton Township , Michigan <p> <p> Dr. William Hanke , a dermatologist on our editorial board , responds to your question . <p> " Whiteheads , or closed comedones , sometimes become problematic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and past history of sun exposure . The best treatment is usually extraction ( acne surgery ) . Superficial chemical peels , microdermabrasion , and topical retinoids can help prevent recurrence . However , periodic extraction may be necessary . " Alternative to Hysterectomy <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> I hope you will help educate women that there are options to hysterectomy . At age 52 , I was diagnosed with asymptomatic uterine fibroids . Every physician I consulted suggested that I have a total hysterectomy . <p> After three years of searching , I found a surgeon who felt a woman should keep her uterus regardless of her age . Although initially reluctant to see him  --  the only information I could find about him was on his Web site  --  I had a myomectomy and pelvic repair procedures . I was in the hospital two nights , came home with Motrin for pain , and have done extremely well . Pat Miner , R.N. Jackson , Mississippi <p> <p> We sent your letter to Deloris Morgan , R.N. , M.A. , M.D. , of our editorial board . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumors , also known as myomas , are more common in women over 35 years of age and may have a genetic basis . <p> " When surgery is indicated , there are now two procedures which may be performed . Hysterectomy , of course , involves removal of the uterus . Myomectomy , a newer procedure , removes only the fibroid and leaves the uterus intact . <p> " Keep in mind that all surgeries carry risks related to the procedure itself , as well as to anesthesia . Myomectomy would be desirable when a woman is of childbearing age , when the uterus has great importance , and when is responsible for presenting all available treatment options , even if they do not perform the procedures . Do n't be afraid to ask questions nor to seek a second opinion . An enlightened person will always make better decisions . <p> " If I may digress , I would like to share my own very recent experience . I had a total hysterectomy ( including removal of the ovaries and tubes ) on a Thursday and left the hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks postoperative and have very little discomfort . I am very careful to listen to my body as far as activity is concerned . My only pain medication has been Tylenol . <p> " As a woman who was a nurse for 20 years prior to becoming a physician , I share this experience to give you and others courage and hope . Patients have a right to ask questions , receive answers , and be involved in every aspect of their care . If you have a doctor who treats you in this way , let him or her know how much you appreciate it . Practicing medicine today is sometimes very thankless . " A Different Kind of Sunburn <p> Dear Dr. Cory : <p> Is it true that you can get blind by looking at the sun ? Sonja Larson , age 9 Canby , Minnesota <p> <p> We sent your letter to Dr. Eugene Helveston , an ophthalmologist on our editorial board who takes care of children with eye problems . Here is what he says : <p> " The answer is YES ! When someone looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the retina at the back of the eye . At the center of the retina is an area called the fovea . A person with a burned fovea can not see straight ahead and is legally blind . <p> " Under normal circumstances , looking at the sun causes discomfort , and people will look away before any damage is done . Some drugs can dull this protective reflex . Also , it may be possible to stare at the sun without discomfort during a solar eclipse . There is still enough light energy , however , to cause eye damage . <p> " NEVER look at the sun . Wear sunglasses with ultraviolet ( UV ) protection . Sunglasses do not need to be expensive to be effective . " <p> Dr. Helveston adds that he has seen several cases of " sun staring " over the past 40 years . The most striking case involved a young woman who was having difficulty reading . Upon examination , he saw that she had scars on both retinas exactly in the fovea . When he talked to her with her parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then going outside to " meditate " while looking at the sun . Children With Diabetes <p> Dear Dr. Cory : <p> I have diabetes and have to take three insulin shots a day . I also have to check my urine and sugar . I feel embarrassed because I ca n't have sweet things at parties and people always wonder what is wrong with me . Can I lose weight and not be a diabetic anymore ? Jennifer Gallman , age 11 Sylacauga , Alabama <p> <p> We understand that living with diabetes can be challenging . Unfortunately , losing weight will not cure type 1 insulin-dependent diabetes . In some cases , however , getting regular exercise and eating the right foods can help decrease the amount of insulin needed . <p> Exercise and diet control are also important for people with noninsulin-dependent type 2 diabetes , or what was commonly called " adult onset diabetes . " There has been a sharp increase in the number of children with type 2 diabetes . Severe obesity is one of the major risk factors for type 2 diabetes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan helps control diabetes . Parents and teachers can suggest ideas for healthy party snacks that taste good , too . Children with diabetes can educate their classmates and friends by demonstrating how to monitor blood sugar levels and explaining why it is important . Reader Shares Experience With Heart Problem <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> In the Nov. /Dec. 2001 issue , an article concerning Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is shown . I was also born with this problem . <p> When I would have the tachycardia attacks , I would be taken to the emergency room at the hospital and given shots of verapamil . <p> In 1992 ( my age was 62 ) , I went to the University of Alabama Hospital in Birmingham , and Dr. Epstein performed an ablation . I have not had any more tachycardia , and the problem was removed . <p> I do enjoy your magazine very much . Norma Dykes Albany , Georgia <p> Carotid Artery Blockage <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> Over the past several years , I have had three ministrokes . I just recently had a test to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artery . There was 70 percent blockage , and my doctor told me that if there is no improvement , I will have to have surgery . <p> I would like to know if there is a diet that would help lower this blockage . <p> Any information you can give me will be appreciated . Thank you . William M. Courtney Ephrata , Pennsylvania <p> <p> Surgery to remove plaque in a carotid artery is called a carotid endarterectomy . Your letter does n't mention the condition of your other carotid artery . We are aware of one case history in which there was 85 percent blockage in the left carotid and 25 percent in the right . This candidate for an endarterectomy chose a dramatic change in his lifestyle . He went on a low-fat/high-fiber diet , daily exercise regimen , and generous morning and evening doses of vitamin C , SlowMag , folic acid , B 6 , and B 12 . <p> Twenty years later , his blockage was reduced to less than 35 percent on the left and 15 percent on the right . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a civic leader in his community . <p> Please check your library for these copies of The Saturday Evening Post , which contain articles giving good low-fat/high-fiber recipes and research information about exercise for good cardiovascular health : May/June 2000 , page 12 ; Sept. /Oct. 1999 , page 18 ; Jan. /Feb. 1995 , page 20 ; and May/June 1991 , page 18 . <p> Pathologists have discovered during autopsies that some patients with blocked carotids had established sufficient auxiliary circulation through their vertebral arteries in the back of the neck . This enabled them to keep from having a stroke during their lifetime . About 20 percent of strokes are linked to blocked carotid arteries . <p> Physicians check for blocked carotids by placing a stethoscope on the side of the neck . If they hear a slushing sound known as a bruit , an ultrasound test or magnetic resonance angiography can measure the degree of narrowing . Research shows that carotid endarterectomy by an experienced surgeon may reduce the risk of stroke in carefully selected patients . Fish Oil Is Best Source of Omega-3s <p> Dear Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of omega-3 fatty acids as fish oil ? Theresa Zatawesky Key Largo , Florida <p> <p> Dr. Andrew Stoll , director of the Psychopharmacology Research Laboratory at Harvard Medical School-McLean Hospital tells us that fish oil is a better choice than flax oil at this point . " Flaxseed contains high concentrations of the shorter chain omega-3 fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid ( ALA ) , " he explained in a recent interview . " There is evidence now that flaxseed oil may be dangerous at high doses . Four epidemiological studies have shown that an excessive amount of ALA in your system is associated with prostate cancer , whereas fish oil is not . Also , if you try to consume enough omega-3s from more than two or three tablespoons a day of flaxseeds , there is a thyroid-toxic compound in the seed husks that can cause a goiter and low thyroid function . " <p> Dr. Stoll adds that he does use flax oil in his practice , but keeps the dose low . He prefers fish oil . When buying fish oil capsules , look for a product with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as a high ratio of EPA ( eicosapentaenoic acid ) to DHA ( docosahexaenoic acid ) . The product should be totally tasteless . Cod liver off is not a good choice because you could consume dangerous amounts of vitamin A. <p> Research shows that omega-3 fatty acids enhance brain function and help combat depression , schizophrenia , and bipolar disorder . In a recent Harvard study , patients with bipolar disorder who consumed ten grams of fish oil a day experienced a marked reduction in episodes of mania and depression . Ulcer-Free Reader Has Another Request <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> In the Nov. /Dec. ' 98 issue of The Saturday Evening Post , you published my letter telling how you had helped me with the two-week ulcer cure discovered by Dr. Barry Marshall . My doctor at the time would n't treat me , so I went to another doctor , took the cure , and have n't been bothered by ulcers again . You will always be remembered as the one who saved me from all that pain . <p> Now I have another problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I work bending over for long , I almost pass out ; my brother-in-law had similar problems and finally fell off the porch . He hurt his neck and , as a result , had to sell his beloved home . <p> I 'm in pretty good health , aside from the lightheadedness . My doctor says my blood pressure numbers are good . An allergy doctor suggested that . my blood pressure medicine , was making me feel this way , and I 'm inclined to agree with him . Do you know of another approach to this problem ? You sure came through once ! Paul Barber Volcano , California <p> <p> Do you have a blood pressure cuff ? . If not , we would like to refer you to our article , " The ABCs of Blood Pressure " ( Jan. /Feb. 2001 Post ) . We find that problems with balance and lightheadedness follow when the blood pressure drops too low . A log of blood pressure readings taken throughout the day could help you and your doctor better manage your condition . <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An individualized regimen of strength training and balance exercises with a good therapist could do wonders to help avoid injury from a fall . <p> One of our older readers tells us that he is able to control his blood pressure by taking Slow-Mag ( an enteric-coated magnesium supplement ) and extra vitamin C ( about three grams morning and night ) . In a 1999 study , blood pressure readings of patients taking 500 mg of vitamin C daily dropped 9.1 percent compared to 2.7 percent in the placebo group . Patients from both study groups continued taking their blood pressure medicines during the trial . <p> Findings from the federally funded DASH research project suggest that many Americans can reduce their high blood pressure by switching to a low-fat , low-sodium diet and doubling their intake of fruits , vegetables , and low-fat dairy foods . Medical Progress <p> Dental x-rays may be a new tool in predicting stroke risk , according to a recent study published in the Journal of the American Dental Association . Researchers from the University of California-Los Angeles say that panoramic or wide-angle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untreated , can block blood flow from the heart to the brain and precipitate a stroke . Nutritional therapy and medications help reduce arterial plaque . <p> New research from the United Kingdom shows that warming patients before breast , varicose vein , or hernia surgery helps prevent postoperative wound infection . In the randomized study , 14 percent of nonwarmed patients developed wound infections compared to 5 percent of patients who were given local or systemic warming for at least 30 minutes before surgery . Previous research suggests that warming patients during colorectal surgery reduces infection rates . <p> Researchers at the University of Florida say that people with recurrent kidney stones may lack a particular bacterium necessary to break down oxalate  --  a byproduct of digestion that is a major cause of the painful disorder . In animal studies , high doses of oxalobacter formigenes safely lowered chronically high levels of oxalate . The naturally occurring intestinal bacterium may be eradicated by antibiotics and health conditions . The Benjamin Franklin Award <p> Indianapolis civic and business leader Robert H. McKinney is living proof that good nutrition and regular exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After returning from a business trip in the early 1980s , the insurance executive began experiencing episodes of chest pain . Doctors recommended surgery for blocked heart arteries , but McKinney opted for a more natural approach . He gradually adopted the low-fat Pritikin Program diet and began exercising regularly . <p> Two decades later and in his 70s , Bob sits on many executive boards , travels the globe , and actively supports a variety of volunteer efforts . " Regular exercise in combination with a high-fiber and low-cholesterol diet has helped a great deal , " says McKinney , who underwent angioplasty in 1985 . " The angina has never come back . When traveling , I carry high-fiber foods with me and try to stay in hotels where there are health clubs . When served a beautiful dessert , I ask if they can bring me some fruit . Usually they can . " <p> McKinney  --  who drinks bottled water containing magnesium to boost his intake of the important nutrient  --  urges everyone to take charge of their health . " Internists may say that you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people need to ask , ' What is my triglyceride level ? ' ' What is my HDL ? ' " <p> The innovative businessman offers health and wellness incentives to employees , and his preventive approach would benefit other employers and their personnel . " We tell our employees that we will reduce their insurance premiums by 10 percent if they have an annual health exam , " McKinney explains . " We also reduce premiums for nonsmokers . That helps everybody  --  employees reduce their healthcare costs , and employers cut their overall incidence of risk .
