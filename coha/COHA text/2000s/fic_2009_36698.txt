The Beginning of the End <br> Numbers was putting on an Academy Award  --  winning performance , taking Jake through every emotion he could possibly think of : scared , confused , dumbfounded , flabbergasted , and victimized . Keyser Sze would have appreciated the level of game Numbers was laying down . <br> Eleven hours had passed since he 'd been taken into custody , six of them under tough interrogation . Although the agents did n't know any more now than they did when they picked him up , Numbers knew that he was far from out of the fire . Crispy Carl had once told him , " When you stand in the flames , never let them see you sweat . " And Numbers maintained his composure . <br> The holding room was painted a dull mint green . It was cruel and unusual punishment just to have to look at it for too long . The only furnishings were four metal chairs and a rectangular table . A DEA agent sat on one side of the table with two empty chairs beside him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluorescent lights overhead seemed to beam only on him . Directly ahead of Numbers was a mirror five feet wide by three feet high . It was obvious that there were agents on the other side listening and watching everything that was said or done in the room . Every so often the agent who was with Numbers would turn around and act as if he was looking at himself , asking the same question again and again . This was his way of letting his superiors know he was getting nowhere fast . <br> " So where are the drugs and money ? " Agent Smith asked for what seemed like the thousandth time . Smith had been at the agency for only a couple of years , but his supervisor liked to use him when they interrogated black suspects . They believed another black male could lure the black perps into a false sense of security and thus trick them into incriminating themselves . <br> Agent Smith fancied himself a good dresser . Today he was wearing a charcoal-gray suit with a light gray shirt and solid black tie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't make it worse for yourself than it already is , " he said , as if he really cared . " If you play ball , we can knock some time off your sentence . " <br> Numbers thought it was funny how the agent spoke to him as if they could have been friends under different circumstances . But if he thinks that I 'm gon na sit here and implicate myself , this nigger must be the one smoking hot monkey ass through a stem . " I do n't know how many ways I can tell you this , man , but I ai n't done nothing . Y'all the ones that hauled me up in here , got me missing in action , my mom 's probably worried sick . You tell me what 's really good , " Numbers challenged . <br> " Numbers , " Agent Smith called him by his nickname , hoping to get some type of reaction , " cut the crap . Yeah , we know what they call you in the streets ; do n't play dumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting up the whole drug transaction . Just tell us where the drugs are , and we 'll make this a little easier on you . " Agent Smith stood up and adjusted his shirt in his pants before walking around to the right side of the table and sitting on its edge . " Little brotha , you think I want to lock you up for the rest of your life ? Nah , brotha , that 's not what I want at all , but if you want me to be able to help you , you got to give me something to work with . " This time he spoke in a hushed tone as if the conversation was just between him and Numbers . <br> Numbers looked straight ahead , his eyes defiant , at the two-way glass in front of him . He spoke , unfazed : " Drugs is not my thing , man ! I say no to drugs like Nancy Reagan asked me to back in the day ! " <br> " So you want to be a hard-ass ? " Agent Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , you know . " Right on cue Agent Smith 's partner and two other suits Numbers recognized entered the room . <br> " Dupree Reginald Wallace , I am Agent Flask . " Agent Flask was a tall , well-conditioned , clean-cut white dude , and he spoke with the arrogance of a man who knew something that he should n't . He did n't bother to introduce the two other suits . Just as well ; they needed no introduction . Numbers knew these crooked cops , O'Doul and Lockhart , all too well from the projects . " You 're in more trouble than you realize , kid . " The two detectives smiled , looking sinister . " It would behoove you to cooperate with us . Do you know this person ? " Agent Flask cracked a bedeviling smile when he tossed a picture of Coney on the table . <br> " What kind of rhetorical bullshit is this ? You know I do . You just picked me up with him twelve hours ago . " <br> " Then you should know he already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation . We 've already cut a deal with him , but we may be able to help you help yourself if you give us your plug , " Agent Flask said . <br> Numbers was n't surprised that Coney had given him up , but that did n't mean that he was going out like a scrub . He kept his mouth shut . <br> " Okay , " Flask said , " how about this guy ? " He dropped a picture of Sanchez on the table . Sanchez was once Coney 's drugs connect and was now one of the people who supplied Numbers . The agent held several other photos in his hand , waiting for Numbers 's reply . <br> The stakes had just gone up , and the seat was getting hotter . Numbers had no idea whether or not they had pictures of him and Sanchez together . His next words could implicate him , but if Numbers was nothing else , he was a gambling man . " He looks sort of familiar , but the face does n't ring a bell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death sentence . " Is n't he one of the original members of Menudo ? " <br> Agent Flask frowned . He did n't think Numbers was funny , and he did n't like it when perps tried to play him . " Okay then , Mr. Funny Man , who is this . . . and this . . . and this . . . and this ? " The agent tossed photo after photo on the steel table . Numbers took a few moments to look at them . It was like seeing a flashback of his entire life since becoming a street hustler , in colored glossy prints . The feds had provided a snapshot of almost everyone Numbers had dealt with in the underbelly of the street game , but what they were unable to do was provide any connection between them and Numbers . He was not in any of the photos , but somehow they knew he knew them  --  they just could n't prove it , so Numbers believed . Why else would they still be digging ? <br> " Come on , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not that good at Pictionary , but I 'm pretty good with music . Can we play Name That Tune next ? " Numbers leaned back in his seat and crossed his arms , not showing his frustration , but he was getting vexed with the interrogation . He knew he could ask for his attorney at any time and put an end to the questioning , but he also knew they 'd probably try to lose him in the system for who knows how long if he did . <br> " We 've got all the time in the world , " Agent Flask said , his square , chiseled face showing little reaction . He left the pictures spread out on the table and walked out of the interrogation room followed by the well-dressed agent . Detective Lockhart walked over calmly with a smirk on his face and abruptly slammed both of his fat hands down on the table , but Numbers did not react . O'Doul kicked one of the chairs toward Numbers , causing it to fall at his feet , and still Numbers did not flinch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Numbers alone with his thoughts . <br> Numbers began to reminisce about his childhood , recalling the many lessons his mentor , Crispy Carl , had taught him . One of the defining moments , a moment that shined like a beacon in his mind , was during one of the last times he 'd seen Crispy Carl . <br> Numbers went to visit Carl at his one-bedroom hovel in 60 Carlton , right behind the building where he lived . Old Crispy Carl was n't doing too well . He was very sick , with no money , no health benefits , and no family to take care of him . Except for Numbers 's occasional visits , he was on his own in every sense of the word . But Crispy Carl never complained about his circumstances because he said his fate was his own doing . Although he never let on , he did look forward to the visits from Numbers ; he loved the boy like a son . <br> " Who 's that ? " Crispy Carl called from his bed , alarm in his ailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key , old pimp ? " Numbers strode through the door . <br> " That 's you , Numbers ? Where you been ? " <br> " Getting my hustle on , of course . Somebody got ta feed your decrepit ass , " he joked . <br> Crispy Carl was n't offended by the remark  --  only a foolish man got upset by the truth . " You seen any of my hoes out there , Numbers ? " <br> " They my hoes now , so stop sweating my bitches . " <br> " Young pimpin ' , I taught you everything you know . " Crispy Carl laughed himself into an uncontrollable coughing fit . <br> Numbers ran to the kitchen , got Carl a drink of water , and then helped him sit up to take a drink . <br> " Hey , young pimp , it 's okay . We all got ta leave the game one way or another . But let me tell you this so you do n't make the same mistake I made . When you leave the game , you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you dig . See , if you go out with four-five-six , you can make the bank whatever you want it to be when you leave , " making reference to the popular gambling game where three dice are used . " That 's called having an exit plan . Crackers know how the game is played . They got 401(k) plans , pensions , and IRAs . " <br> Crispy Carl paused to make sure Numbers understood what he was talking about and to gather his breath . " In the streets we ai n't got none of that shit . Shit like that is foreign to cats like us that 's hustling on the street every day . Still , that do n't mean we ca n't set ourself up to live comfortable when it 's time to put our cards down . You got to be smarter than the rest of these chumps out here . They think that quick money is gon na last forever , and ai n't nothing lasting forever , feel me ? " Crispy Carl sat up in his bed a little more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believing their own hype like their shit do n't stink . I 'm guilty of that shit myself , young player , so believe me when I tell you , you got to get out when the time is right . " <br> Numbers thought about what his mentor was saying . " How will I know when it 's that time ? I 've been hustling as long as you 've known me , Crispy Carl . " <br> " You 'll know when to get out the game , but you have to start planning for your exit not now . . . but right now ! You come a long way from the little runt I met at the number spot way back when . I 'm proud of you for always being the man of your house . " <br> Continues ...
