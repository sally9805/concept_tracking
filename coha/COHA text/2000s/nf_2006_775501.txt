Sara and Francis // Sara Viola Warmbrodt was born on August 21 , 1896 , in the mill town of Arkansas City , Kansas . For all of her time on this earth , she would be quite a character , a memorable presence not only in her daughter , Elizabeth 's , life but in those of nearly every person she would touch over the years . Through it all , good times and bad , she and Elizabeth would remain inseparable . Even during times of estrangement-for they did have their disagreements-they knew to whom to turn for unwavering support : each other . " My mother was my best friend , " Elizabeth would later say , " my guide , my mentor , and my constant companion . " Indeed , mother and daughter were life and breath to each other , and thus it would remain until Sara 's death in 1994 , just one month short of her ninety-ninth birthday . // Historically , Sara has been portrayed as a negative influence on Elizabeth 's life , mostly because of her steely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so-called " stage mothers " are seldom viewed in a positive light . Like many parents who encourage their children into show business , Sara had once been an entertainer . In 1922 , she had changed her name to Sara Sothern after relocating to Los Angeles from Arkansas City to pursue her dream career . Her mother-Elizabeth 's grandmother-was a talented singer and musician who played both piano and violin . She was very encouraging of Sara 's goals and did n't mind her dropping out of high school to pursue them and also study acting in Kansas City . After appearing in a number of small productions in the Midwest , Sara found herself in Los Angeles . There , she was cast in a supporting role in a theatrical revival of Channing Pollock 's The Sign on the Door . ( The silent movie released a year prior had starred Norma Talmadge . ) After Pollock saw her in that show , he cast her in a key role-a crippled girl , miraculously healed-in his play The Fool , based on the life of Saint Francis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much in alignment with Sara 's own spiritual belief as a Christian Scientist-that unwavering faith in a higher power could result in physical healing far beyond the reach and understanding of the medical profession . // The Fool first opened in Los Angeles to weak reviews but eventually made its way east to New York , where it opened on Broadway at the Times Square Theater in October 1922 . There it played to full houses for nearly a year , even though the show continued to receive generally poor notices-except for Sara , who was singled out for her performance by some reviewers . She was faintly praised by the New York Times critic , who said , " In the final scene of the third act , a little cripple , well played by Sara Sothern , falls on her knees in prayer and rises to find that she can walk . " When the show went to London in September 1924 , Sara went with it , and caused quite a bit of pandemonium there . After the opening night , at least according to an interview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extricated from a mob scene , with fans " clamoring for bits of her frock and locks of her hair as souvenirs . Later , " Pollock recalled , " the Prince Royal went to her dressing room to present her with a diamond brooch the size of a belt buckle . " // Margaret DeForest was the daughter of a friend of Sara 's from Palm Springs , California , where Sara spent her elder years . She recalls of the Taylor matriarch , " Though she was a slight woman , Sara had a magnetic personality . People gravitated toward her , as they would one day her daughter . She was funny , smart and nobody 's pushover . I knew her when she was much older , but I saw many pictures of her as a young woman . She had wonderful scrapbooks of her show business days , and loved to show them to me and my mother . She told us that Elizabeth had gathered the clippings for her , compiled them herself , and then gave her the scrapbooks one year as a birthday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sara was a real beauty . She was funny , too . She had a biting sense of humor which , sometimes , people did n't know how to take . In her later years , she used to be frustrated by Elizabeth 's life . It seems that someone forgot to teach that young lady manners , ' she used to say . Then she would add with a wink , And I guess that would have been me . ' I loved her . I just thought she was great , I really did . " // After The Sign on the Door closed , four more less successful theatrical productions in New York followed for Sara Sothern . By the time she was thirty , she began reconsidering her options . It was at just that time that Francis Taylor-a man whom she had dated only casually back in Arkansas City-came back into her life . // The handsome and charming Francis Lenn Taylor was born on December 28 , 1897 , also in Arkansas City , of Scotch-Irish descent . He had dropped out of high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his beloved , if also demanding , uncle , Howard Young , in St. Louis . When Francis turned twenty-one , his uncle gave him the opportunity to move to New York and work at a gallery Howard opened there , the Howard Young Gallery , which specialized in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century European paintings . // Sarah and Francis became reacquainted one evening quite by happenstance at the El Morocco nightclub in New York . Afterward , they began to enjoy each other 's company on a regular basis . She found him to be quiet and unassuming , so different in character and temperament from the many show business types she 'd known in recent years . True , he did n't have the kind of spark that she usually required to stay interested in a man , but still , she could n't help but be fascinated by him . He 'd been to Europe with his uncle , had a wealth of interesting anecdotes to share about his travels , understood art and could talk about it for hours , so there was seldom a dull moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tall and lean , with an aristocratic and refined bone structure , he had piercing blue eyes and light brown wavy hair , which was combed straight back . His was a scholarly air with his horn-rimmed glasses and natty three-piece suits , in which he always looked great . He was always dressed for presentation , never casually . He accepted life as it was and had little interest in changing things . He was whimsical and artistic in nature , not practical . Do n't get the wrong impression of him , though : He was n't exactly carefree . Quite the contrary-he was a contemplative person who often seemed uneasy and distracted . Elizabeth once said that as a young girl she would sit and stare at her father as he sat in his easy chair , his eyes closed and brow furrowed as if attempting to solve a complex , troubling problem . A gentle man , he shied away from confrontation and would do anything in his power to avoid an argument . Later in life , at the end of any conflict his fiery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victor . In fact , it 's safe to say , at least based on the recollections of those who knew the Taylors well , that Francis never won an argument with her in their entire marriage . " She 's the boss , " he would say . " What she says goes , and that 's fine with me . " Indeed , he had great respect for Sara , thought her to be savvy and smart as well as talented , and never felt that he did n't have a place in her life . He knew his place . // Sara 's zest for life had led Francis to lose all sense in her presence when he first met her . Inexplicably drawn to her , he confided to friends that he could n't stop thinking about the ball of fire called " Sassy " by those who only spoke of her and not with her . He loved her unquenchable spirit , her joyous soul . In fact , Francis saw in Sara many qualities he had wanted for himself , such as charisma , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in someone 's face and say-as she would quite often- " I know what the problem with you is , and here 's how to fix it . " It was when that finger was finally wagged in his face , as he would recall it , that he felt somehow reborn . Indeed , the first sign that he and Sara were perfect for each other was when she agreed with him about his faults . She could see right away that he lacked focus and confidence , that he thought of himself as somewhat of a social misfit . He was foggy and scattered and did n't " finish his sentences with strength , " as she noted . " We can all change , darling , " she would tell him , " and for you , that will prove to be a godsend . " Her brash manner may have proved a sticking point for previous suitors , but Francis found it refreshing , even enlivening . He was filled with an intense inquisitiveness about her , and to be so fascinated by anyone was , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew Francis before he met Sara were dumbfounded by the changes they soon began to see in him . Her coaching led him to address many of his behavioral deficiencies , at least as she saw them . Under her influence , he began to walk with purpose and at a quicker pace . He shook the hand of every person he met with strength . He made firm eye contact . He spoke highly of himself to others ; Sara loathed the British tradition of self-deprecating humor and would n't stand for it in her suitor . He took all of her advice seriously-and it worked for him . His transformation profound after just a few months , he knew he had one woman-Sara Warmbrodt-to thank for all of it . Indeed , he felt like a new man . // Francis and Sara were married in 1926 . Then , after one more show in New York , The Little Spitfire , Sara Taylor made the fateful decision to leave show business . // Marrying and eventually raising children rather than having the career in show business she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not something she ever felt had been foisted upon her . " I gave up my career when I married Daddy , " she once said ( referring to Francis ) , " and all the king 's horses and all the king 's men could n't have made me take it up again . " As a Christian Scientist , she believed at a core , spiritual level that she could have her life exactly as she wanted if only she approached it with a positive and affirmative attitude . " Divine love always has met , and always will meet , every human need , " she would say . Therefore , she rarely complained about her life or about her decisions . Rather , she felt empowered to handle anything that came her way , and she hoped to pass the same kind of belief system on to the children she might one day bear . // At this same time , a new branch of the Howard Young Gallery was about to open in London at 35 Old Bond Street in the heart of the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francis manage the new establishment . He absolutely insisted upon it , in fact , for Howard was an assertive man who almost always had his way . Francis and his new wife moved to London and settled into a suite at the luxurious Carlton Hotel , paid for , of course , by Howard Young . // Now that Sara had given up her career as an actress to be a wife , the rest of the world seemed to slip out of her view . Francis was her passion . For his part , he was just as devoted to her . While previously not a particularly effusive man , he now made an art out of romancing his wife . For instance , knowing Sara 's favorite chocolatier was Fortnum and Mason , Francis would regularly stop at the high-class grocer 's in search of the ultimate confection . He might surprise her with a bag of caramelized ginger , a tin of sweetmeats , or the traditional box of chocolates . He went to great lengths to show his devotion to her . // For the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe in first-class style-London , Paris , Berlin , Vienna , and Budapest-thanks to Howard Young 's generous underwriting of such excursions , many of which were business-related . In the process , they would traffic with the powerful and affluent of the art world and acquire from them old masters for the Young Gallery . It was a heady time , but it was n't to last , because when Sara became pregnant at the end of 1928 , the couple decided to take root in London . Howard leased a lovely nineteenth-century cottage for them at 11 Hampstead Way . With its beautifully manicured gardens and pathways and its gorgeous views of the verdant Hampstead Heath , it was an enchanted place . // In June 1929 , Sara gave birth to their first child , a son named Howard ( after his great-uncle ) . With the addition of the baby , the Taylors ' home was suddenly too cramped with just two bedrooms . The couple did have a nurse , a cook , and a driver , after all . It would make sense , Sara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could live at the house . Howard quickly accommodated her and solved the domestic problem by purchasing nearby-with cash-a larger eighteenth-century home ( with Tudor and Victorian influences in its architecture ) known as Heathwood , at 8 Wildwood Road , again overlooking the Heath . Delightfully landscaped with aged trees and colorful wildflowers , the redbrick home came complete with a large kitchen , stately dining and living rooms , pool and tennis court , and live-in accommodations for all of the help . // Howard was a stunning baby who , his mother once proclaimed , " looked like a Botticelli angel . " He really did , with large , expressive blue eyes , wavy blond hair , and perfectly placed features . He was his daddy 's boy , though . Sara believed a father and son should share a special bond . Therefore , while she was an affectionate and effective mother , she would often abdicate parental duties to Francis . It was as if she saw the raising of her firstborn as an opportunity to further shape her husband into an even fuller , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's betterment would not last forever . Things would change dramatically , beginning on February 27 , 1932-the day Sara gave birth to a daughter , a baby she and Francis would name Elizabeth . //
