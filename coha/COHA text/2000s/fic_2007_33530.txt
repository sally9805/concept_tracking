Chapter One He saw through the eyes of a woman . The five-globe gas chandelier . The twenty-foot-long mahogany table . The twelve members of the Men and Women 's Club . Doctor . Banker . Publicist . Teacher . Student . Professor . Suffragette . Architect . Philanthropist . Journalist . Accountant .... Unerringly he focused on the barrister who sat at the head of the conference table . Silver frosted the crisp chestnut hair at his temples ; uncompromising lines radiated outward from cold hazel eyes . The truth forcibly struck him . During twenty-four years of marriage , his wife had been the perfect hostess and mother . And then she had died . Alone . Pinned underneath the wheels of a carriage . He had not known the woman who bore his name , and who had borne his two children . He had not known her fears , her dreams , her needs . Staring at the man with the silver-frosted hair and the cold hazel eyes , he realized that this was the man she had seen over breakfast each morning : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Father . Barrister , Queen 's Counsel . Recognition erupted into an explosion of sound . The mahogany door slamming into a burgundy-papered wall snapped James back into his own masculine perspective . The woman whose pale green eyes he had for one infinitesimal moment stared through stood frozen in the doorway , handextended to recapture the brass doorknob that had escaped it . Her face beneath a round straw hat was gently marked by maturity . Vibrant red hair framed her temples . Her green-checkered velvet coat with matching walking skirt and green silk polonaise were unapologetically feminine . She was a woman who did not hide from her sexuality . Clearly she did not belong to the Men and Women 's Club . The squeak of a chair sliced through the quiver of vibrating wood . Even as he watched , the mahogany door rebounded off the wall . She had a small hand . It was covered in a tan , kid-leather glove . Any second now that hand would grasp the doorknob , and the woman would walk away . A stranger . As his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... James snared her gaze . " What does a woman desire ? " The harsh words ricocheted off the gas chandelier . His voice was not that of the gentleman he had been raised to be : in public ; in court ; in bed . It was the voice of a man : commanding ; demanding . The chagrin in the woman 's eyes blossomed into surprise . At the same time , her gloved hand wrapped around the brass doorknob . " I beg your pardon ? " Her voice was clear , the clip of gentility softened by a faint country dialect . She was n't from London . Her origins were of no consequence . James did n't want a socialite 's pardon : he wanted a woman 's honesty . " Does a woman desire the touch of a man ? " His wife had in the past spoken of the latest on dits , charitable activities , and of their children . The members of the Men and Women 's Club had in past meetings discussed the biology , the history , the philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they acknowledged the existence of simple human need . But James did need . Did this woman ? He raked her face with prosecutorial eyes . " Does a woman desire to touch a man ? " Shock stunned the members of the Men and Women 's Club-men and women who had yet to understand the difference between sexology and sexuality . " Are women repulsed by a man 's sex ? " Passing carriage wheels shrilled . The faint blare of a German polka wafted up from the street below . Inside the burgundy-papered meeting room , the silence was absolute . " Exactly what is it , " James pressed , " that a woman desires from a man ? " Something flickered inside her eyes-something James had never before seen . " Pray accept our apologies , madam " - masculine censure shuttered her face- " on behalf of Mr. Whitcox . We are in a private meeting , as you see . If I may direct you .... " Immediately her gaze skittered away from James and found Joseph Manning , founder and president of the Men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apology on James 's behalf , perhaps . Or to ask directions to the room she had all along intended to visit , a museum exhibition where men would not inflict unwanted masculine needs upon her . " Pray accept my apologies , madam , " James ruthlessly intercepted , " on behalf of Mr. Manning . He forgets that the purpose of the Men and Women 's Club is to discuss sexual relations . " The woman 's gaze snapped back to his . " Doctor Burns " - James indicated the woman who sat to his left with a short thrust of his head- " is a firm believer in Darwin 's theory of sexual selection ; whereas , Mr. Addimore " - he indicated the accountant who sat to his right- " is more interested in Malthus 's thesis for population control . Mrs. Clarring " - he indicated the philanthropist who sat on the right side of the accountant- " is an expert on erotic composition in still-life paintings . " " Mr. Whitcox , this is highly irregular- " " If you had not interrupted when you had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a beautiful woman , but her beauty did not touch him , " I would even now be delivering a lecture on English law and divorce . Are you interested in English law and divorce ? " The woman 's small , gloved hand clenched . " No , thank you- " " Are you interested in Mr. Darwin 's theory of sexual selection ? " " I 'm not familiar with Mr. Darwin 's theories . " Dark rose tinted her cheeks . " I really must- " Go . But James could n't let her go-not until he knew whether that brief flicker inside her eyes had been a result of feminine need and not the effect of flickering gaslight . " Are you interested in erotic art ? " He knew her answer before she opened her mouth-the only answer any respectable woman could rightfully claim . " I have never seen any works of erotic art- " " Would you like to ? " The woman 's head snapped back . Simultaneously , a volley of " Mr. Whitcox ! " rang out . " Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher who underlined flowery prose in archaic French novels and labeled them erotic metaphors . " Have you ever seen a French postcard ? " Her pinched nostrils turned purple . " Sir ! " James glanced one by one at the men and women who sat stiffly upright , ten in medallion-backed armchairs , the journalist in a lattice-backed wheelchair . He had investigated each member before joining their circle of five bachelors , five spinsters , and one wife whose husband preferred the oblivion of alcohol over the comfort of feminine arms . " We have discussed sexual symbolism in art " - his gaze slid past the young men in their dark , tailored wool suits that resembled his own , lingered on the young women in their conservative dresses and dark bonnets- " but how many of you ladies have ever seen a painting or photograph whose sole purpose is to arouse and titillate ? " Angry red blotching their faces , the women gazed past James 's shoulder ... or at the notes on English law and divorce neatly stacked by his left hand ... or at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They knew how to respond to a sexless gentleman . They did not know how to respond to a sexual man . " We are here to discuss sexology , sir , " Jane Fredericks curtly rallied ; the white feather in her black bonnet pointed to the ceiling like a signpost to heaven , " not pornography . " He studied the twenty-seven-year-old suffragette who idolized Josephine Butler , a clergyman 's wife who had successfully campaigned to repeal the Contagious Diseases Acts on the basis that it enabled men to enjoy sex without suffering . Not once in the seven months that James had been a member of the Men and Women 's Club had he seen inside her eyes a spark of warmth , of need , of curiosity . " Have you never wanted to see what it is that excites a man , Miss Fredericks ? " he dispassionately queried . Frigid green eyes stared at the wall behind him . " No . " She believed her lie . Seven months earlier James , too , would have believed it . He sought out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , madam ? Do you desire to see a French postcard ? " James remembered the gold with which he had paid his mistresses , and the jewelry with which he had gifted his wife . Compensations , both , for enduring his touch . " Or do you think that women are naturally repulsed by objects that incite lust in a man ? " Red-gold lashes shadowed her cheeks . She had elegant cheekbones . Her gaze seared James 's left hand . She stared at his wedding band , a badge of respectability . Marriage had paved the way to political appointments . What had marriage brought his wife ? he wondered . Social position ? Daughter of the First Lord of the Treasury , she had possessed a privileged place in society before marrying James . What had marriage brought to the fashionably dressed woman who now stared at the lie that circled his finger ? She shone with the confidence of knowing a man 's protection , but did she enjoy satisfying a man 's desire ? " I suggest , sir , " the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaze pinned his , " that your wife would best be able to answer your questions . " Straw hat screening her face , she stepped back . " My wife is dead . " The words ripped through the chill spring air . She paused , head snapping upward . James 's gaze was waiting for hers . " I will never know which of my touches excited her , or which ones repulsed her . I will never know how I failed her , or even if I failed her . I will never know what she needed , because I never asked . " " Why not ? " The rejoinder was swift . The woman 's body remained poised for flight . " Because I was afraid , " James said . Feminine gasps greeted his admission : a man could do or say many things as long as he did n't admit fear . " I am still afraid . " A masculine protest overrode the feminine gasps . " I say , there- " James ignored the accountant 's objection . " I am forty-seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's passion . " " Mr. Whitcox , sir ! " the suffragette sputtered over the hiss of the gas chandelier . " I need to know that it 's not too late . " The woman with the vivid red hair remained motionless , her expression arrested . " I need to know that men and women share the same needs . " A shudder vibrated the wooden table ; a door slamming below . " I need to know that there can be honesty between men and women . " A short , urgent shout sounded from the street outside . The solitude that dogged his every waking moment stretched out before James . " I need to know that a man and a woman can live in the same house , and lie in the same bed , and be more than two strangers . " Low murmurs bounced around the mahogany table , feminine whispers recoiling off of masculine rumbles : " I never- " " - does he- " " - not himself- " " - grief-  " " Mr. Whitcox , really , sir , " Joseph Manning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for this melodrama . " " I am being honest , Mr. Manning , " James riposted , every fiber in his body concentrated on the woman who stood on the threshold . " Are you offended by honesty , madam ? " He had no difficulty reading what lurked inside her eyes : uncertainty . " I try not to be . " " Are you frightened by your sexuality , or is it a man 's sexuality that frightens you ? " " Sir , I can not answer for all women . " " I do n't expect you to answer for all women . " He only wanted her to answer for herself , one woman to one man . " I 'm not certain what it is that you 're asking , " she evaded . James leaned forward , daring her to be a woman of flesh and blood , and not a paragon of feminine virtue . " I am asking if you want to be touched by a man . " Crackling paper underscored his challenge . " I am asking if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs the touch of a woman . " Her pupils dilated , darkness swallowing light . James did not relent . " I am asking if you lie awake at night aching for the satisfaction that men are told respectable women do not desire . " Desire reverberated inside the room . Sighing wool slid over squeaking leather . Six women leaned forward , waiting to hear a member of their sex acknowledge what they themselves were afraid to admit . " I do not indiscriminately desire a man 's touch " - the gently accented voice was quiet , resolute ; the woman 's chin firmed- " but yes , I do desire to be touched . " Emotion squeezed his chest . James recognized it as hope . " Do you desire to touch a man ? " he asked . " To give pleasure , as well as to receive it ? " The wooden table groaned as five men leaned forward to better hear her answer . She took a deep breath , green-checkered coat rising and falling over her full breasts . " I do not believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not the answer James had expected . The question she had earlier asked shot out of his mouth : " Why not ? " Memory clouded her face . " If it were so , surely a man would not apologize to a woman when he touches her . " Pain slashed through James . He had apologized to his wife every time he had come to her bed . He had apologized through his restraint , that he not overwhelm her with his masculinity . He had apologized through his silence , that he not repulse her with labored breathing or an animalistic grunt of completion . Their sexes had touched , but they themselves had not . Every release James had gained had been weighted with the knowledge that his wife did not share it . It had been her duty to submit . It had been his duty to procreate . Their duty had made them strangers . " You are concerned that you did not satisfy your wife , " a feminine voice unexpectedly charged . James focused on pale green eyes instead of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lie awake at night , aching with need . Women have hands and fingers . " She notched her chin , daring him to judge her . " We do not need a man to give us satisfaction . We are quite capable of satisfying ourselves . " A shocked intake of breath shot down his spine . " You said you wanted to know if women have the same needs as men , " she continued , " I believe they do . " A distant Big Ben bonged the half hour . " I believe there are women who may want more out of marriage than what their husbands are capable of giving to them , just as I believe there are men who may desire more than what their wives are capable of giving . I do not believe either are at fault . " The pain James had earlier felt briefly shone in her eyes . " You said you needed to know if there can be honesty between men and women . I believe we have both just now proven that it is , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bobbed her head- " gentlemen . " Having opened the door on feminine desire , she now closed it . " You are afraid of your sexuality , " he goaded . The closing door halted ; her head snapped upward . " I am forty-nine years old " - laughter abruptly illuminated her face ; the soft skin at the corners of her eyes crinkled- " and have been married for thirty-four of those years . I have five children , and eight grandchildren . I assure you , sir , there has been no time to fear my sexuality . " Nor had she possessed the opportunity to explore it , she did not need to add . James did not share the laughter she so generously offered . She had married at the age of fifteen ; he would have been thirteen , studying at Eton . Silver glinted out of the corner of his right eye , a flash of metal spectacles . Marie Hoppleworth , a perennial student at the age of thirty-six , focused on the enigma that stood in the doorway . What was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the members of the Men and Women 's Club could not speak honestly among themselves ? " You are not from London , " he said shortly . One second the woman 's eyes were alight with laughter ; the next second they clouded with wariness . " No . " James had been a barrister too long not to recognize the look in her gaze : she was hiding-but from what ? Deliberately he used the provocative term for the metropolis that lured like a flame both the young and the old , the poor and the wealthy . " Why did you come to the City of Dreadful Delights ? " " I wished to experience a season of entertainment , " she said with sudden reserve , " and amusement . " James 's voice was pistol sharp . " Without your husband ? " Had she come to London to find a man who would not apologize for touching her ? How could he blame her if she had ? She visibly recoiled . " I am a widow , sir . " A widow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been filled with ambition . Her youth had been filled with children . Did she yearn to experience all the things as a woman of forty-nine that she had not experienced as a girl of fifteen ? (
