<p> Following the fatal bus accident March 2 at I-75 and Northside Drive , readers were invited to share their stories of scary highway conditions in Georgia . Here are excerpts . <p> I-20 design flaw creates accidents <p> I work outside and am quite familiar with the highways and roads in Atlanta . By far the most dangerous spot in Atlanta is located on the west side of metro Atlanta at I-20 westbound just before the I-285 interchange . The highway has a design flaw at this point ( right under the Linkwood Road overpass ) . A left lane is added , the wall separating eastbound and westbound traffic stops and the freeway curves right . <p> I have seen three accidents at this spot where cars have left the westbound side and crossed over into the eastbound lanes , which are lower in grade . I saw one accident where a car flew off the westbound side and flipped over in the eastbound lanes . To make matters worse , there was a tall light pole in the middle of the freeway at this spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an SUV that left the westbound lanes hit the pole , resulting in two deaths . The pole has since either been knocked down by another vehicle or removed . The shame of it is that the state DOT could eliminate this problem by just extending a guardrail at this spot . I do n't know why they have failed to do so . <p> KEVIN KITCHEN , Austell <p> Signs need to be enlarged , clarified <p> The Georgia Department of Transportation has failed to address and heed the complaints of the driving public . DOT spokespersons have used the pathetic excuse that their designs for roadways and signs have followed the " standards . " Now after multiple deaths , they continue to rely on standards that have failed consistently . <p> " Driver error " is a pallid defense . Highway signage is not consistent . It must be emphasized that highways move humans , not just vehicles . Moving in fast multilane traffic requires more than " antiquated standards " developed in the last century . <p> Direction signs to interstates are small and faded . Entrances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crooked or bent out of shape as if DOT does not care . Exit sign letters need to be larger and legible at great distances for drivers to react to avoid multilane changes in fast-moving traffic . <p> " Stop , Yield , Wrong Way " need to be enlarged for emphasis . Is it time that we begin use of international highway symbols for faster visual recognition ? <p> DOT has the authority , the public responsibility to respond to the human needs in design of highways . <p> JOHN BUSBY , Atlanta <p> Rumble strips at exits on left would help <p> In South Georgia , there are long stretches of country roads that currently have four and two-way stops . To warn approaching drivers ( usually of 18-wheelers ) the highway is marked with three to five ridges that give off a horrid sound when you cross them . This would wake the sleeping driver , warn the preoccupied and save the numerous victims to come . Maybe the DOT can mark these left-handed exits with ridges . <p> Just an idea . Hopefully , someone will take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> LORETTA RIGGINS , Marietta <p> I-75 signs for trucks contradict each other <p> I-75 north through Cobb County is the worst I 've seen beginning with the signs over the wrong lanes for the I-285 exits and the Windy Hill exit . Then there 's the contradicting signs beginning at the Canton Road overpass that states , " No trucks over 6 wheels allowed in left lane . " A half-mile up is a sign on the right shoulder stating , " No trucks over six wheels allowed in 2 left lanes . " Finally the third sign at the I-575/I-75 split states , " No trucks over six wheels allowed in left lane . " Trucks are bouncing all over the place . Makes it scary when I 'm on my motorcycle . <p> KARL G. VOLLMER , Kennesaw <p> Widen lanes , end HOV , enforce speeds <p> I 've been living and driving in metro Atlanta all my adult life . My husband and I have driven extensively across the U.S. and foreign destinations . Several years ago , while driving a Los Angeles highway we noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use . In California , drivers are not allowed to misuse the HOV lanes for passing or weaving in and out of traffic as they are here . Here , drivers disregard the solid lane markings routinely . <p> In metro Atlanta , I have seen horrendous misuse of these lanes by speeding drivers  --  and zero police presence  --  especially on I-85 in Gwinnett County . I now steadfastly avoid I-85 although I live within one mile of it . <p> I doubt whether HOV lanes encourage car-pooling . <p> Car-pooling has never caught on and probably never will . I think HOV lanes are nothing short of an attractive nuisance . They are literally accidents waiting to happen and should be eliminated if people willfully misuse them  --  and the laws are not going to be enforced . <p> I also suspect that space for building Atlanta HOV lanes was created by reducing the width of other lanes  --  narrowing lanes at the very time when SUVs became popular . The result : reduced width/margin for error between cars and trucks packed like sardines on our roads coupled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerously high speeds . <p> Eliminate HOV lanes . Enforce highway speeds . Build wider lanes . Provide simpler markings with large easy-to-understand graphics . <p> I was pleasantly surprised during our 3,000-mile drive through Spain at how well their highways are marked , not only with words but also with wonderful large simple graphic diagrams that any driver can understand while maintaining highway speeds  --  even foreigners in rental cars like us . <p> CHRIS DRAKE , Brookhaven <p> Fixing I-75 bottleneck will take time , money <p> As drivers head north on I-75 during the evening rush hour , they can always plan on a backup due to a bottleneck at the South Marietta Parkway . The problem occurs when two lanes of on-ramp traffic coming from the South Loop east side try to merge into the five lanes of traffic of I-75 north . <p> What I feel could help the situation is to have the east lanes of the two lanes that are merging onto 75 north merge into the west lane much sooner . That would leave only one lane merging into I-75 north traffic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the north-moving traffic on I-75 , to gain some distance , exits at the South Loop and keeps going north to the west-merging lane to I-75 . <p> What would alleviate that problem is to have traffic on the south loop that wants to get on I-75 north make a left-hand turn onto ramps leading to I-75 , rather than the existing way of making a right loop onto the merging lane . That would take some money from the Georgia DOT and years of planning , so I 'm sure that wo n't happen ! <p> JIM McKUNE , Woodstock <p> Northside Drive exit needs flashing light <p> Being an Atlantan , I have always enjoyed the Northside Drive HOV exit as it 's a good escape chute from I-75 . When I realize that traffic is snarled that far back from the 17th Street bridge , I have the last-chance option of taking back roads around the problem . I agree that the verbiage , if read by a weary , early morning driver of a bus may mislead that person to take this " alternate lane " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suggest replacing the stop sign at the top of the ramp with a red flashing light . If this should happen again , a driver would be aware of an approaching stop and subsequently realize that this is not an alternate route for buses and the like . <p> Does that not sound like an easy fix ? <p> SEAN BORJA , Atlanta
