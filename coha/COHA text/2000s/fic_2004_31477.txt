Come on , baby . Give it to me , you sweet thing . " Robbie MacBain came awake totally alert and battle-ready , with absolutely no idea what was going on . " That 's it . Move for me , baby . " What the hell ? He had not gone to bed with a woman , so he should n't be hearing a husky , seductive voice in his ear . He knew he was in his bedroom at the farm , but , more important , he knew he was alone . " Just a little bit more , sweetie . " Robbie sat bolt upright in bed and tried to see through the darkness . Nothing . No woman . Yet her voice had been quite distinct  --  and soft and sexy and close . " Come on , " she whispered with fading patience . " I 've got to get going . Oh , for God 's sakes , just move ! " At the squawking of several disgruntled hens , Robbie snapped his head toward the baby monitor on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and jumping out of bed . The henhouse . He was supposed to be guarding the henhouse . He scrambled into his pants and grabbed his shirt , stopping only long enough to glance at the clock by his bed . Five-thirty , he saw , breaking into a grin as he slipped on his shirt and found his socks . Deciding earlier that he did n't need to be sleeping outside on this cold March night , he had put the baby monitor in with the hens and let the electronic device do his job . And it had worked , he decided as he hopped first on one foot and then the other , pulling on his boots and tying them . This was the third henhouse raid this week . Only half a dozen eggs were taken each time , and there was always a dollar bill left in their place . But it was the principle of the thing . Someone was buying his eggs . He did n't much care for mysteries , and that sexy-voiced woman on the monitor was one mystery he was suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skidded to a halt in the kitchen . Quietly , he opened the farmhouse door and crept onto the moon-shadowed porch just as the woman came sneaking out of the henhouse . He blinked into the night . If he had n't just heard her voice on the monitor , he would swear his thief was a kid . She looked like a child , squatting beside a backpack as she carefully placed her stolen breakfast in it . She spotted him when he stepped off the porch . She dropped two of the eggs when she stood with a startled squeak , swung the pack onto her back , and bolted for the pasture . " Hey ! Hold it ! " She scaled the paddock fence with the agility of a cat . With an utterly male grin Robbie broke as he vaulted over the fence himself , that what height she did have came from a pair of long legs that swiftly carried her into the night . But he was six-foot-seven in his socks , and Robbie did n't doubt for a minute he would quickly run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was and what she was doing stealing his eggs . Robbie 's smile was gone a little over a mile later . She was getting away ! Rasping for breath through gritted teeth , Robbie forced his legs to move faster . He 'd arrogantly told his boys that he could catch a simple egg thief , and " No , thank you , " he did n't need their adolescent help . He was not about to let last night 's bragging to them turn into hoots of laughter this morning . Robbie chased the woman for nearly two miles before he finally realized he was n't going to catch her . The long-legged little cat had left the pasture , sprinted down the gully and over the knoll , and disappeared into the thick forest of TarStone Mountain . Dammit ! It was a cold walk back in the stingy morning light . Robbie used up most of his litany of curses during the first mile of his return and was down to swearing in Gaelic by the time he reached his yard . He stopped in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open henhouse door , and looked back at TarStone to see the rising sun peeking over its summit . " It looks like scrambled money for breakfast again , " Cody said as he stepped out of the henhouse , snapping a wrinkled dollar bill between his hands . " We got any cheese to go with this ? " he continued despite Robbie 's warning glare . " Ai n't nothing like burnt toast and dollar-bill omelets to start the day right . " Robbie took a threatening step forward . The sixteen-year-old juvenile delinquent pocketed the dollar bill , crossed his arms over his chest , and smiled . " Is that egg I see on your face , boss ? " he asked . Robbie also folded his arms over his chest . " No , you 're seeing my decision that you 're cooking breakfast . " Cody 's smile disappeared . " I cooked yesterday . " " You did such a fine job and you can do it again today . " Muttering what Robbie guessed was a nasty curse , Cody stomped off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped onto the porch , moving aside to let Cody go slamming past him . Robbie sighed . Gunter was n't dressed for school , but for work . With his arms still crossed over his chest , Robbie turned to face his next challenge . " Harley called . Two of the loggers are sick , " Gunter said as he approached . " So I 'm going to work today . " Robbie was n't surprised that the eighteen-year-old would rather spend a day of hard labor in the woods than go to school . Hell , Gunter would rather muck out stalls than go to school . " Harley said two loads of saw logs are leaving today , " Gunter continued , stopping in front of Robbie , his nearly black eyes more eager than defensive for a change . " You need me to run the loader . " " I can run the loader . " " You have a meeting with Judge Judy this morning . " Damn . He did . And those saw logs needed to go out today . " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's standing between you and an eight-by-ten cell . " " I only have metal shop and one regular class today , " Gunter continued . " I 'll make it up tomorrow . " Robbie returned Gunter 's direct stare and weighed the boy 's need for an education against his desire to escape the structure of the classroom . Hell , everyone needed a safety valve occasionally , and a long day working in the woods just might serve to remind Gunter that an education would make him an easier living . Besides , the kid deserved a reward for going two whole months without starting a fight at school . Robbie nodded agreement . " Tell Harley I 'll come out to the site after my meeting with Bailey . And Gunter ? " he said as the boy turned to leave . " You only have ten weeks left to get your diploma . Anyone can endure anything for ten weeks . " A faint grin appeared on Gunter 's usually stoic face . " I 've endured your cooking for a month , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gram Katie is bringing over a lasagna for us tonight , " he offered in concession . " With salad and homemade rolls . " Gunter turned fully to face Robbie , his expression serious . " When are you going to look for another housekeeper ? " Robbie shook his head . " Word 's out about you hoodlums . I could n't offer enough money to bring another woman here . " " We 've learned our lesson , " Gunter said . " If it will save us from your cooking and doing our own laundry , we 'll treat her like the queen herself . " " I 'll be sure to put that in the ad , " Robbie said , turning at the sound of a cane tapping a hurried rhythm on gravel . Gunter turned , too . And seeing Father Daar walking down the driveway from the woods , the boy spun on his heel and sprinted for the house . It took all of Robbie 's willpower not to do the same . " I 'm wanting a word with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to scatter the chickens . " I need your help on a matter . " " If this is about your well pump , I 've already ordered a new one , " Robbie said , hoping to forestall the old priest who lived in a cabin halfway up TarStone Mountain . " It 'll be in tomorrow , and the boys and I will install it after school . " Daar was shaking his head . " I 'm not here about the pump . " He stepped closer and lowered his voice when Rick came rushing out of the house . " It 's a bit more important than that . " " Peter overstuffed the dryer again and started a fire ! " Rick shouted from the porch . " Where 's the extinguisher ? " Robbie bolted for the house , leaving the priest in a flurry of flapping hens . This was all he needed , for his mother 's old homestead  --  which had survived four generations of Sutters  --  to be burned to the ground by a fifteen-year-old delinquent who thought household appliances were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was the second fire Peter had started this month . Three weeks ago , it had been the toaster , along with the curtains , and part of one cupboard that had gone up in flames . They still had n't gotten the smell out of the house . Robbie grabbed the fire extinguisher hanging on a peg not two feet behind Rick , ran into the laundry room , and doused the flames already spreading up the wall . Stepping back into the kitchen , wiping powder off his face , Robbie scanned the group of wide-eyed young men staring at him as if he held their fates in his hand . Which he did . Four boys , all wards of the state , all in his care for the last eight months . Well , except for Gunter . Gunter had been liberated on his eighteenth birthday six weeks ago , but the boy seemed in no hurry to leave . That was fine with Robbie . For as long as it took Gunter to get a toehold on life , he would have a home here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not care to see the other three boys , especially fifteen-year-old Peter , living under the same roof with a known brawler who was nefarious in three county courtrooms and assorted detention centers . Hence today 's meeting . " You moron ! " Rick said , punching Peter in the arm . " Are you trying to get us sent back to foster care ? " " What in hell is this place ? " Peter growled , rubbing his arm and glaring at his older brother . " This ai n't no foster home , " Rick snapped . " And it 's a hell of a lot better than the detention center . Dammit , I 'm not leaving here because of you , " he said , moving to punch him again . Robbie caught Rick 's fist in his own . " Nobody is going anywhere but to school , " he said softly . " If the house burns down , we 'll live in the barn . You 're all staying here until you decide you 'd rather be someplace else . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new housekeeper , " Cody said , pulling his burning toast from the shiny new toaster . " We 'd have a housekeeper if you had n't run off the last three , " Robbie reminded him . " None of them had a sense of humor , " Cody said with a snort , scraping the black off his toast into the sink . " I 'll be sure to put that in the ad , " Robbie said , setting the empty fire extinguisher by the door to take to town and refill again . He headed into the downstairs bathroom to wash his face and hands . " You boys have to take the school bus today , " he said through the open door . " Gunter , take the pickup to work . " He stepped back out of the bathroom , wiping his hands on his shirttail because he could n't find a towel . " And do n't go anywhere but to work and back , " he warned , giving the youth a level stare . " And do n't make me sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How come Gunter is n't going to school ? " Peter asked . " Because I already learned how to run a dryer and a toaster without starting a fire , " Gunter told him . " Where ? In home ec ? " It took only a threatening step forward from Robbie to stop Gunter 's advance on Peter and a warning growl to get all four boys moving toward the door . " ' Morning , Father , " Cody said around a mouthful of toast as he stepped aside to let the priest in the house . " ' Morning , Father , " Gunter mumbled as he squeezed by . " ' Morning , Father , " both Rick and Peter said as they rushed out to the safety of the yard . Daar gave each of them a silent glare as they strode past . Robbie could n't help but smile . For the last eight months , the old priest had used sheer terror to bully the boys into respecting him . Daar had given them a piercing glare upon their arrival , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really a wizard , and warned that if they did n't act civil around him , he 'd turn them all into dung beetles with his powerful staff . They 'd nodded respectfully , only to roll their eyes at each other once they turned away , apparently deciding to humor the obviously crazy old man . Robbie wondered what their reaction would be if they knew Daar really was a wizard ? His full name was Pendar , and besides turning delinquents into dung beetles , the ancient druidh was also capable of bringing ten Highland warriors eight hundred years forward through time . Robbie knew this because his father , Michael MacBain , had been born in twelfth-century Scotland . So had Robbie 's uncle Greylen MacKeage , along with Morgan , Ian , and Callum MacKeage . And since providence had seen fit to gift Robbie with the powers of guardianship over his two clans , the warriors had happily dropped Daar 's care onto his capable shoulders about five years ago , after many lectures that Robbie not believe anything the old priest told him . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could have turned into disasters but for Robbie 's vigilance . " About my little matter , " Daar said , waving a hand through the lingering smoke as he made his way to the kitchen table . " I 'm afraid it will have to wait , " Robbie said , going over to the counter and pouring them both a cup of coffee . " My day just filled up . I now have to buy a clothes dryer on my way to see Judge Bailey . " Daar snorted and thumped his cane on the floor . " I could take care of that old hag if you 'd let me . " " Martha Bailey is not old and she 's not a hag , " Robbie told him , setting a cup of coffee in front of him . " She 's only doing her job . " He took a seat at the table . " And our deal is you do n't mess with the magic if you want to stay living on TarStone Mountain . " Daar harrumphed , took a sip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another sip . Robbie took a sip of his own coffee , stood up , dumped it down the sink , and went to the fridge to look for some juice . " My matter ca n't wait , " Daar said . " The vernal equinox is tomorrow . " Robbie stilled , the fine hairs on the back of his neck rising in alarm . He slowly straightened from peering into the fridge and looked at the priest . " What 's so important about the vernal equinox ? " " All the planets will be lined up just right . " " Right for what ? " " To fix this little problem we have . " It was the " we " that most alarmed Robbie . Daar 's little problems had a way of becoming huge headaches for Robbie , and when " we " was attached , it usually meant a full-blown migraine . Robbie closed the fridge door , set his fists on his hips , and glared at the priest . " And what exactly is our problem ? " Daar turned away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Your papa and the others are going back to their old time come June , " he whispered . Robbie could only stare at Daar 's back . " I have only three months to extend the spell that brought them here , " the druidh continued to his coffee . He finally turned to look at Robbie . " They will have been here thirty-five years on this summer 's solstice , and that 's when the spell runs out . " It was n't a headache Robbie felt but a painful pounding in his chest that made it difficult to breathe . He was going to lose his father in three months ? And Grey and the others ? Dammit . They had wives . And children . And a supposedly stable life here . " Say something , " Daar whispered . " Make it stop ! " " I 've tried ! " the priest snapped back , thumping his cane on the floor again . " I nearly blew up the summit house trying , and I started a landslide down TarStone ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head filling with images of the destruction . " And the summit house fire last month ? You started that ? " Daar looked down at his cane , rubbing one of the weathered cherrywood burls with an age-bent hand . " I also caused the flood that took out the town bridge last week . " He lifted his chin . " I was trying to figure out a new spell to extend the old one . " Robbie ran an unsteady hand over his face . " Let me get this straight . You 've known about this ... this thirty-five-year time limit all along , and you 're just telling us now ? " " Not us , " Daar said , his eyes widening in alarm . " Just you . Laird Greylen and the others ca n't know about this . " " Why not ? It 's their lives about to be destroyed . " " But we can stop it , " Daar said with an eager nod . " You 'll go back in time and get me a new book of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old spell to keep them here . " Still standing by the fridge , still reeling in shock , Robbie slowly shook his head . " Oh , no . I know all about your attempts to replace the book you blew up twenty years ago . As long as you do n't have those spells , we are all safe  --  fires and landslides and floods notwithstanding . " " But that 's what I 'm trying to tell you . The five remaining Highlanders are not safe . Come the summer solstice , they 're headed back home . " " They are home ! " " To their old home ! " Daar shouted . He heaved a huge sigh . " Robbie , " he said softly , getting up and coming to stand in front of him . " I brought Greylen MacKeage here to father my heir . Ya know that already . But what nobody knows is that I only needed him here long enough to sire seven daughters and protect his youngest girl , Winter , until she 's old enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast a permanent spell , I would have had to make concessions . " " What kind of concessions ? " Daar took a step back . " I would have had to live out the rest of my unnatural life in modern time . " Robbie stepped forward . " So , for your own selfishness , you chose to rip apart the lives of five men . Twice ! " Daar raised his cane as a puny defense . " I was n't thinking that far ahead . And it was only supposed to be Greylen , not the others . They were an accident . " " Which makes me what ? Another accident ? " Daar frantically shook his head . " Nay . You are their salvation . You were born their guardian and have become a fine warrior , Robbie . And now it 's time to fulfill your destiny . " " By getting you a book of spells and restoring you to full power , " Robbie said , crossing his arms over his chest and settling his weight back on his hips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your need . " Daar gasped , stepping back and bumping into the table . " Ya think I 'm lying ? " He pointed his cane at Robbie . " A pox on ya , MacBain ! I 'm a priest ! " Robbie sprang from his negligent pose and advanced on the priest until that cane was touching his chest . He towered over the druidh and gave him a look so threatening that Daar stumbled backward into his chair and sat down with a thud . " Do n't even attempt to curse me , old man , " Robbie whispered . " My guardianship over my two clans is protected by divine right . " He leaned even closer , glaring into Daar 's widened blue eyes . " You 've been allowed to live here only because Winter MacKeage will need your help in the future . And until then , you will stay quietly up at your cabin and consider yourself lucky to be under the protection of a benevolent laird . Because , " he continued , pulling the cane from between them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be as forgiving as Laird Greylen if you had interfered in my life the way you did his . " " It ... everything worked out for him . He loves his wife and daughters and his new life here . All the Highlanders are happy . " Robbie grunted , straightening away from him . " Only because you ca n't further interfere in their lives . " " I 'm not completely powerless , " the druidh said , defiantly lifting his chin now that there was some distance between them . " Aye . You can still start fires and floods and landslides . " " I can still travel through time , " Daar added , once again leaning forward . " And the planets will be lined up just right tomorrow eve . " Robbie closed his eyes and scrubbed his face with both hands before looking back at the tenacious old priest . He heaved a weary sigh . " There will be no time travel , druidh . No spells and no book . " " Then in three months , there will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned . " It 's going to happen , Robbie , whether ya like it or not . Unless , " he quickly added , " ya travel to thirteenth-century Scotland and get me a new book . " Robbie stared at him in silence . How many times had he been warned not to believe Daar ? And how many tales had the old priest spun over the last five years , attempting to gain Robbie 's help in replacing his book of spells ? But this was by far the most devious story to date . Daar knew Robbie would do anything to protect his family . " No , " Robbie growled . " Meet me on the summit of TarStone at sunset tomorrow , " Daar said , grabbing his cane and standing . " And bring yar sword . " " No . " " Ya might want to find the MacBain plaid your papa was wearing when he came here , " the priest continued , walking to the door . " Ya ca n't wear clothes made of modern materials or take anything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No . " Daar stopped , his gaze lifted to the ceiling but focused inwardly in thought . " I should probably send ya back about ten years after the Highlanders disappeared . " " I 'm not getting your book , old man . " Daar leveled his crystal-clear blue eyes on Robbie . " Ya have no choice , " he softly told him . " Not if ya want your family to stay intact . Tomorrow at sunset on the summit , " he said , turning and walking out the door . Robbie stood rooted in place for several seconds , then rushed out onto the porch . " Why me ? " he asked the retreating priest . " Why not Greylen or my father or Morgan ? They know that time , the ways of the people , and the terrain . " Daar stopped in the middle of the driveway and turned to face him . " Though still vital men , they 're too old , Robbie , " he said . " I 'm needing a powerful warrior in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be lethal if need be . " " What about Callum 's son ? Or one of Morgan 's boys ? " Daar shook his head . " Their strengths run to business , not warring . MacBain raised you as a guardian . He understood your calling and prepared you well . " Daar shot him a crooked grin . " I 'm thinking your short career as a modern soldier may also prove helpful , though you wo n't be able to take any modern weapons with you . " " It 's a moot point , because I am not going . " " Then I suggest ya enjoy what little time ya have left with your papa and uncles , " Daar said , turning away and walking into the woods . Continues ...
