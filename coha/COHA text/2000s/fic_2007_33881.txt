Chapter One Mark and Bill Loren D. Estleman " Samuel Langhorne Clemens , meet William Frederick Cody . " " Buffalo Bill , " said the white-haired man in the white suit , committing his hand to the newcomer 's oaken grip . " Mark Twain , " said the long-haired man in the buckskin coat , flashing white teeth in his chestnut-colored Vandyke beard . Their host waited until both men were seated before sitting down himself , then sprang back up to summon the white-coated waiter out onto the terrace . " Libations , gentlemen ? " he asked his guests . " I myself am temperate , but do not let that- " " Bourbon , " said Twain , plucking a long cigar from a hinged silver case . " The same , " said Cody , peeling the foil from a plug of chewing tobacco . " Soda ? " The waiter drew the cork from one of an army of vessels on a wheeled cart . " Bourbon , " said Cody . " The same , " said Twain . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bared his famous grin beneath the thick mustache . " Lemonade , and keep it coming . I 'm as parched as the Badlands . I 've been shouting myself hoarse to those fools setting up the Boone and Crockett cabin at the fair , " he confided to the others . " It seems no one in Chicago knows how to care fora wooden building since the fire . " Cody said , " I stole away while Miss Oakley was performing , for a glimpse of the exhibit . Splendid job . A fine homely contribution to that antiseptic circus . You know , the fair 's directors turned me down when I offered to bring the Wild West to the White City . They said it was incongruous . So I rented the lot across the street and set up there . " " A regrettable decision on their part , " Roosevelt said . " Your exhibition has been steadily outpulling the World 's Fair ten to one . Have you been to either , Mr. Clemens ? " " I intended to go to both , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've felt sound enough to quit my room . The prospect of a ride on either Mr. Ferris 's wheel or Mr. Cody 's Deadwood Stage still turns me a festive shade of green . And tomorrow I must go back East . " " A pity . I 'm sure America is champing to hear your observations on both phenomena . " Irritably , Roosevelt signaled to the waiter with his still-empty glass . The fellow shook himself out of an apparent trance and reached for the pitcher of lemonade . As a mere member of President Cleveland 's Civil Service Commission , Roosevelt made a feeble impression on the serving class in the presence of America 's greatest humorist and the hero of Warbonnet Creek . " I should n't wonder . " Twain blew a chain of smoke rings that was swiftly torn apart by the wind off Lake Michigan . " America never knows how it feels about a thing until it 's received its instructions from me . " " America knows a great American when it hears him , " Roosevelt said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American . I am the American . " Cody chuckled . " You 're an entertaining hoss , Mr. Clemens . I once heard Jim Bridger explain how he roped a cyclone and rode it out of a Blackfoot ambush-'Square knots only , ' he said ; ' a Dakota twister 'll slip right out of a bosun ' - but he war n't a patch on you when it comes to exaggeration . " " I return the compliment , Mr. Cody . I 'm on record in opposition to the decline of the fine art of lying , but it 's in no peril as long as you walk the earth . " An uncomfortable silence followed this remark , broken only by Cody 's reflective chewing and the popping of Twain 's lips on his cigar . From the terrace of Roosevelt 's suite , the trio could just make out the white spires of the Court of Honor , the centerpiece of the 1893 Chicago World 's Fair , dominated by the revolving structure George Ferris had designed for the amusement of those courageous enough to board one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . Cody 's cud bonged into a cuspidor provided by the waiter . For Roosevelt , an enthusiastic amateur in the sport of prizefighting , it sounded like the opening bell to the first round . " Which lie are we discussing ? I 've told my fair share and seen a heap of ' em in print . " " I recall an account attributed to you of a shooting contest between yourself and the late-lamented James Butler Hickok , " said Twain . " You took aim simultaneously at the same prairie dog at a distance of forty paces , fired an instant apart , and placed both slugs through the unfortunate creature 's left eye , one right behind the other so the orbit was not enlarged . " " The account was inaccurate , " Cody assented . " It was the right eye . " Roosevelt yelped his high-pitched laugh . " Bully ! He 's a match for you in the well-placed jest as he was for Wild Bill in marksmanship . " Steel glittered beneath Twain 's shaggy black brows . But Cody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an arm fringed in leather . " I would n't presume , " he said . " Let 's agree I 'm as handy with powder and a ball as Mr. Clemens is with his wit and a quill . " Twain demurred . " Strictly speaking , anyone with sufficient eyesight and a steady hand can learn to shoot a glass ball thrown by a man on his payroll . It 's quite another thing to raise a snigger in an auditorium packed with Pennsylvania Dutchmen . I nearly started a riot the last time I spoke in Allentown , after sixty minutes of excruciating silence . " " The Dutch appreciate a pleasantry once you 've found their range . I 'd admire to see you try your hand with a band of Missouri bushwhackers . " " Ten words at the expense of a Kansas Jayhawker would place them in convulsions . I 'd venture to wager I 'd render every last one to a mound of quivering jelly before you managed to drive a half-dozen nails into a timber with your best six-shooter . " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver from his hip , took swift aim , and blasted the cork from a squat bottle of brandy perched on the portable bar . Roosevelt barked a mild oath ; the waiter leapt back three feet from his position beside the cart . Twain alone did not react . He drew on his cigar , blew a plume of smoke into the blue exhaust from the revolver , and asked the waiter to inspect the bottle . The man hesitated , then stepped forward and with a shaking hand lifted the vessel and peered at its neck . " Not so much as a chip . " His voice quavered . With a flourish , Cody spun the weapon on his finger , offering the butt to Twain . The humorist accepted it and examined the ornate engraving . " ' Presented to the King of the West by the Queen of Great Britain and Empress of India , ' " he read aloud . " Victoria put it in my hands personally when we played London , " Cody said . " I 'd just bested a visiting French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have killed ten men in duels of honor . That grand lady commands the greatest army in the world , and knows her firearms . It 's the finest in my collection . " Roosevelt gulped lemonade . " You might have found a less unsettling way to demonstrate your point . " Twain laid his cigar in a heavy tray , slid a handsome slim rosewood box from an inside breast pocket , opened it , and withdrew an elegant gold-plated implement with a nib inlaid with ivory . Cody took it and peered at the barrel . " ' To Mark Twain , from Thomas A. Edison , ' " he read aloud . Twain said , " It 's a prototype , not yet available on the market . Edison invented it . It requires no dipping ; a reservoir inside the barrel furnishes the ink automatically . The Wizard of Menlo Park challenged me to amuse his young friend , a clever machinist 's apprentice named Ford , born to a farming family in Michigan of Irish and German stock . Edison had never seen the fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a simple anecdote about Jewish immigrants . That was my prize . " " It seems a splendid instrument . " Cody handed it back . " It leaks something fierce . I gave up on it after it expectorated over an entire page of Roughing It . " " Then why carry it ? " asked the frontiersman . " For occasions such as this . " Twain returned the pen to its box and the box to his pocket . Cody emptied his glass and glanced at the waiter , who refilled it and Twain 's , which lacked an inch of vacancy . " I heard something about a wager . " " My bump of humor against your trigger finger ? " Twain sipped and flicked drops of bourbon from his mustaches . " A series of increasingly difficult targets against a queue of mountingly humorless listeners , " Cody said . " When one misses , the other must score , or forfeit the contest . " He tossed down his drink in one motion and slammed down the glass on the table that separated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of one week 's proceeds from the Wild West in Chicago to three months ' royalties from your latest literary effort . " " One month , " Twain said . " It is n't Ben-Hur , but it 's kept my loudest creditors silent . " Cody dismissed the matter with a gesture . " Who shall hold the stakes ? " " Friend Roosevelt , who is too honest to cheat and far too wealthy to corrupt . " " I accept ! " The commissioner 's broad face flushed with excitement ; then he cleared his throat and adjusted his spectacles . " I must , however , insist upon a more appropriate venue . Hotel personnel are notoriously unreasonable about indoor gunplay . May I suggest Colonel Cody 's exhibition grounds ? " Twain put out his cigar . " His advantage would be too great . The gallant South made that mistake when it took the field at Gettysburg . We are but a few hours by rail from Missouri , where a man may shoot all day and not disturb so much as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statue of Mr. Clemens in every direction , " Cody said . " I fought with the North , but fortunately was not present at Bull Run . I have an alternative , provided civilization has not crept that far . " When he identified the spot , all three men touched glasses and drank . The waiter hastened to refill them . " Hideous ! " Roosevelt , clad in tweeds and high laced boots , scraped a foul mess off one heel onto a plank . " To think that such a sordid place should exist in the midst of one of the greatest cities of the world is shameful . If someone does not come forward to reclaim this land from its inhabitants , I shudder to think what the twentieth century will hold . " Buffalo Bill Cody , who had exchanged his soft bleached buckskins for rougher hides stained with old sweat and darkened from smoke , thumped his chest with both fists and breathed deeply the scents of Blue Island , a neighborhood neglected by all but derelicts and the saloonkeepers who lived off their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I see my youth . It was here that Ned Buntline and I recruited Indians for Scouts of the Plains fifteen years ago . " " The Old Pepper tribe , I suspect . " With a toe , Mark Twain nudged an empty bottle whose label advertised that pungent brand of whiskey . He was careful to avoid contact with the rubbish and horse offal with his white linen cuffs . He alone was attired more fittingly for a lecture hall than for the dregs of a city . " We sold out everywhere we played , from here to Albany , " said Cody . " It 's gratifying to see you earned enough to afford real Indians . " " Spare your ammunition , " warned Cody . " The contest has n't begun . " The location , originally a sandbar in one of the canals fed by Lake Michigan , had been built up over the years by deposits of garbage and manure scraped from the streets . Clusters of saloons stood upon it , ramshackle affairs without foundations , but a spot where one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space and an unobstructed view of the lake , where expired rounds could fall to rest without causing casualties . Roosevelt alone had come without the support of acquaintances . Cody was accompanied by reloaders from the Wild West ; a number of genuine Sioux and Cheyenne from the exhibition , resplendent in tribal trappings ; some unidentified parties ; and a young man named Johnny Baker , a protg who wore his hair long like Cody , dressed in buckskins , and specialized in launching and setting up targets . Twain had brought along an amiable band of admirers , men and women whose eyes twinkled even as they picked their way carefully among the topographical hazards and whose lips quivered perpetually on the edge of laughter . " Even the finest pump requires priming , " the humorist had explained . " Quite proper , " Cody said . " One warms up with the easier marks . However , I shall select the audience . " " And I shall select the targets . " Simultaneously , the two contestants produced bank drafts-Twain from a pocket , Cody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to Roosevelt . The pair averred that the totals were averages only , to be amended later should protest arise . The commissioner placed the drafts in a flat wallet and slid it into a pocket . " Surely , this is not just a matter of material gain . " Twain said , " In the words of my creditors , ' It ai n't the principle of the thing , it 's the money . ' There is , however , a question of pride . " " The gentleman from Missouri has struck the critter square betwixt the eyes , " said Cody . " He 's claimed for himself the championship title without raising so much as a pistol or a fist in its defense . I 'm challenging it . Henceforward , the winner of today 's match will be known exclusively as ' The American . ' " " Satisfactory , Mr. Clemens ? " " The gentleman from Missouri " slid the band off a fresh cigar . " Mr. Roosevelt , Mr. Cody , it suits me right down to the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends of the narrow island to practice . Young Johnny Baker drew specially blown glass balls from a trunk he 'd brought along and hurled them over the lake while Cody , using a Deluxe Winchester 1873 carbine with gold plate on the receiver , burst them first one by one , then in twos and threes , levering fresh rounds into the chamber with lightning speed . His group met each success with cheers and applause , not counting occasional exceptions : The Indians observed the spectacle with impassive expressions , their arms folded beneath their blankets , while a stoutish , middle-aged woman wearing an abundance of clothing and a hat with a veil remained glum-faced . On his end , Twain , puffing his cigar and hooking his thumbs inside the armholes of his snowy vest , related a succession of stories from his childhood in Hannibal through his adventures as a riverboat pilot on the Mississippi for his increasingly appreciative audience . As with Cody , not all were voluble : A leathern man in a rumpled suit smeared with tobacco ash , his fingers stained with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow pencil on a thick fold of newsprint . At length , both competing parties announced that they were ready to begin . One of Twain 's companions handed him a flask of brandy . Twain slanted it Cody 's way inquiringly . The other demurred . " That which fuels the storyteller 's engine clouds the sharpshooter 's eye . " " A metaphor well and truly mixed . " Twain swigged . " Defer to me the art of oratory and I in turn will keep my paws off your guns . " Cody bared his teeth . " Choose a target , sir . " Twain held out the flask for his companion to take , then cast his glance up and down the length of the island . Finally , he turned his attention toward the lake . After squinting against the sun 's glare for most of a minute , he took the cigar from his mouth and used it as a pointer . " Yon piece of flotsam , to start . " All stared in that direction , Cody holding up his hat as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driftwood , bleached white and rounded at the edges like soap , bobbed in the swells sliding toward shore . From that distance it seemed no larger than a needle . Cody looked at Roosevelt . " Sixty yards ? " The man addressed raised and resettled his spectacles , scowled . " I 'll accept your word . I myself can see nothing but blue water . " " Fortunately , " Twain said , " politics is one of the few professions where shortsightedness is no obstacle . " His coterie chuckled . " Wait your turn , sir . " Cody put on his hat , bent to scoop up a handful of loose earth , and cast it with the wind . He accepted his Winchester from Johnny Baker , worked the lever , shouldered the weapon , and pressed the trigger ; he seemed hardly to aim . The pale target stood on end , spun , and fell back to the surface with a smack . A hoot went up from his admirers . The Indians and the woman remained silent . " Well done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours . " (
