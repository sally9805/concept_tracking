Section : the class debate <p> Everywhere you look in America today , the middle class is being squeezed . A quick search of the phrase " middle-class squeeze " yields 352 hits on The New York Times ' website alone . Whether looking for housing , tax breaks , health care , child care , luxury cars , white-collar jobs , or countless other elements , services , and products seemingly essential to American life , the middle class just can not catch a break . <p> Indeed , independent schools have found themselves increasingly concerned with finding ways to keep middle-class families from being " squeezed " out of a quality education . At this point in time , it appears to be a significant challenge . <p> As tuition growth at independent schools outpaces inflation , schools are faced with increased requests for financial aid from families that would not have applied ten years ago . And , as families apply in greater numbers , more are unlikely to qualify or receive financial aid in the amounts that they deem they would need to enroll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enroll their child in a public school or a less expensive private school option . The result is that schools feel their own kind of squeeze : increased pressure to stem the tide of middle-class defections to lower-cost alternatives . <p> One of the ways schools manage this pressure is by investigating how to make more middle-class families eligible for more financial assistance . However , before schools consider strategies for addressing this challenge through financial means ( need-based aid , scholarships , discounts , etc. ) , it is important to consider the proper perspective on what it means to be middle class in America today , and also what it means to be middle class in independent schools . They are not synonymous . Defining Middle Class <p> In the book The Fragile Middle Class , the authors make it clear that defining middle class is no easy task . Even the federal government ( which seems to classify just about everything ) is reluctant to define it , " . at least in part because class status is not a function merely of money or of other easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Of course , one federal source , the 2005 Annual Demographic Survey , March Supplement , ( produced by the Bureau of the Census ) , does reveal that an objective measure of the " statistical middle income " range is the middle 20 percent of all U.S. family households . In 2004 , this quintile earned between $43,400 and $65,828 . By contrast , the top 20 percent of family income earners earned $100,000 and higher . <p> What is interesting about these data is that many of those who consider themselves middle class and who say they are feeling the ' squeeze " earn a lot more than the statistical middle class earns . When independent school administrators describe their middle-income families and the difficulty those families are facing , they do not speak of the $43,000-$66,000 family . By and large , schools feel that their financial aid programs serve this economic group pretty well . The annual earnings of the middle-income cohort that schools describe range from as low as $65,000 to as much as $200,000 ( depending on whom you ask ) . Although not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not enrolling because they do not qualify for any ( or enough ) financial aid . <p> Concerns over tuition squeeze are , in fact , evident . The NAIS Student Service for Financial Aid ( SSS ) data show that families at this high income level are asking for financial aid at a rate that exceeds their representation in the general population . The percentage of families earning over $100,000 who applied for financial aid at independent schools , for instance , was up to 21 percent in 2002-2003 . As admission directors feel the pressure to meet enrollment goals , and business officers struggle to meet the fiscal goals , the obvious question emerges : These are our middle-class families  --  and we 're losing them . Can we not help them qualify ? <p> One striking and noteworthy reality , of course , is that these families actually are rich . If we adhere to an income-based view of class ( as schools typically do ) , they are upper class , or can be considered at least as moderately affluent . The problem is that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't care that they are wealthier than most . The reality of this degree of privilege eludes most Americans in this income bracket . Even if we consider some of the **27;480;TOOLONG metropolitan areas such as New York , Chicago , and San Francisco , we find that , while it is true that families earn more in the high-cost cities , an annual income at $100,000 still places them in the top tiers of income earners , not in the middle . Even in San Francisco , by far the wealthiest of the three cities , more than 60 percent of families do not earn $100,000 annually . Reconciling What It Means to Be Needy <p> Reconciling the notion of " neediness " for middle-class families requires deliberate scrutiny . One important reality is that many families at the higher income levels ( i.e. , the independent school middle class ) may still qualify for financial aid , particularly at high-cost schools . Consider that at a day school with a tuition of $17,000 , a family of four without any assets can qualify for financial aid until its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle-class family income . When factors such as multiple children enrolled in tuition-charging schools and local cost-of-living adjustments are factored in , families with annual incomes of $200,000 or more could still be eligible for some aid at some schools . This reality clearly debunks the myth that a family has to be poor in order to qualify for financial aid . But , given the range of neediness that can be served by the typical day school ( 80 percent or so of American families ) , how much further can or should financial support go ? <p> One caution regarding finding solutions to this problem is that there is not any aggregate data ( and very little school-level data ) that supports the subjective notion that the middle-income family is missing or even dwindling from independent schools . <p> The evidence is almost always anecdotal . When the " middle-class squeeze " issue does reach a rhetorical boiling point within a school , it is imperative for schools to study  --  through surveys and other methods  --  whether or not the middle income is truly missing or dwindling from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid pool . It is critical to know what the real problem is before wholesale reconstruction of a process that serves the " statistical " middle income already quite well . <p> The challenging difficulty confronting independent schools , of course , is that the $105,000 family that stops qualifying for aid does not feel like it is in the top 20 percent of American income-earning families . As such , when its request for financial aid is denied , it expresses frustration that all middle-class families like itself are being squeezed out of the ability to attend the school . Why does the $105,000 family feel poorer than it really is ? Maybe it is just psychological . The American Dream is sometimes characterized as capitalizing on one 's ability to be upwardly mobile , socially and economically , no matter where one starts . As such , Americans may have a greater tendency to " look up " than to " look down " when it comes to issues of wealth and privilege . <p> In the independent school setting , the " middle-class " parent earning $105,000 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or thinks ) that many other families in the school community earn three to 10 times more than they do ; there is tangible immediacy to the feeling of being " relatively " poor . The daily reminders of not being able to buy a luxury car for your child 's 16th birthday or take the family on a European vacation , or even hire tutors or SAT preparation counselors make the feeling of earning " only " $105,000 one of inadequacy , not of the privilege and affluence it actually is . Should financial aid eligibility be based on the " relative poorness " of applicants within a school community ? The difficulty in reconciling the neediness of families in the highest quintile of U.S. income earners ( but perhaps in the middle quintile of a particular school 's income earners ) against the imperative to stretch already limited financial aid dollars to the true middle- and lower-income families creates the dilemma schools continue to face . <p> The pursuit of another manifestation of the American Dream  --  to live better than your parents did  --  often is accompanied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not feasibly support over the long run . The rise in personal debt , increases in credit card use , higher rates of multiple car ownership , the increasing square footage of homes ( even amidst record-setting fuel prices ) , and the full-steam-ahead real estate market symbolize that the quest for more in America is as aggressive as ever . Money for an intangible , though vitally critical , commodity such as education is becoming increasingly difficult to find for those who feel like they should have the best of everything but at a price they are willing to pay , even if they are actually unable to afford it . This is , indeed , an accumulated effect of American societal trends that make this battle for discretionary income hard for schools to fight . How much of such lifestyle issues and choices should financial aid administrators take into account when assessing financial need for the middle class ? Many schools feel conflicted about using financial aid to , in effect , subsidize middle-class discretionary spending . <p> These realities expose the dilemma of shaping strategy for a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " upper class " than it appears . As tuition continues to rise at hyperinflationary rates , this dilemma will become even more difficult to manage . <p> Tactics for Recalibrating Need Regardless of what the data show of their actual affluence , when the " emotional " middle class begins looking at other education options , and when a school has data-driven evidence of a decline or gap in its middle-class enrollees , the school must consider and be able to justify ( and pay for ) tactics for rethinking price issues for their self-defined " middle-class " cohort . The accompanying two tables ( Figures 1 and 2 , on page 79 ) illustrate an important first step in framing the middle-class dilemma from a tactical approach . The question a school must ask is : How much money does a person have to make per year in order to afford our school , without financial aid ? Using national data on tuition and SSS methodology , the general answer to this question is around $92,000 to $105,000 . <p> The next important piece of information to know is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SSS methodology ( Figure 1 ) , paying for independent schools would require significant sacrifice for families at the $70,000 level . In fact , the 14 to 16 percent of total income these families are expected to pay for tuition is significantly higher than the 1.8 percent that Americans earning over $70,000 typically spend on education . ( Bureau of Labor Statistics ) <p> Even if there is agreement on what constitutes the independent school middle class , and even if there is agreement that the independent school middle-class families need relief , an even more challenging question emerges : How does a school provide that relief ? How should schools rethink or recalibrate assessing financial need for families in this cohort ? <p> One tactic is to keep tuition increases at or below the rate of inflation . For the typical household , income does not rise as fast as independent school tuition . Independent school tuitions that rise 4 or 5 percent per year are considered to be normal or even moderate . However , most families typically struggle to keep pace with inflation ( around 1.5 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , according to the 2004 American Community Survey , the median income ( that is , the middle of the " statistical " middle class ) for families in 2004 was about 1.3 percent less than it was in 2000 ( before adjusting for inflation ) . Moderating tuition increases can help those families better manage the growth in price relative to the growth of their income . <p> On another tactical front , many schools have asked NAIS to adapt its SSS methodology to reduce the family contributions for middle-class families . NAIS took some modest steps to accomplish this in the late 1990s . The problem , however , is that the majority of schools reported in a follow-up survey that they were not able to fund the increased need this change caused . Clearly , addressing the issue through altering the financial aid criteria is only part of the battle ; funding the additional created need , while not siphoning funds from lower-income applicants , is a tougher challenge . <p> As difficult as it is to define the middle class , refine tactics for assessing its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need , there are several precedents . Here is a case study of a school that was able to answer these questions in a strategic , meaningful , and impactful way : CASE STUDY : St. Mark 's School of Dallas <p> A wealthy friend of St. Mark 's School of Dallas ( Texas ) offered to provide a significant gift to the school in order to provide financial aid to children from middle-class families , since he sensed that the school was losing the middle class due to tuition squeeze and other possible reasons . The school studied its middle class reality and proposed a method or process for allocating the gift dollars . The school conducted a survey of the student population to identify , among other things , the distribution of students along income bands and assert whether or not students in the middle were underrepresented . Indeed , they found that to be the case and determined that their school 's annual middle-income range was about $75,000 to $110,000 . <p> The school also acknowledged that , for these families , the SSS methodology tended to render @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or eligible for very small grants ) . In their estimation and study , it was , indeed , these families who needed a moderately sized grant ( $3,000 to $5,000 ) to make the tuition affordable . As such , the school established the Middle-Income Grant Program , targeting families in their middle-income range . The school required families to apply for need-based aid but would then reduce the SSS-calculated parental contribution for these families on a sliding scale , ultimately asking the family to pay between 70 to 80 percent of the SSS-determined amount . This would increase their eligibility and the difference was funded by the income drawn against the donor-supported fund . <p> Assume the annual school tuition was $16,700 . If a family earning $105,000 applied , it would be asked to pay about $16,700 by the SSS calculation , and be ineligible for need-based aid . However , given the family 's income , it would be eligible for the Middle-Income Grant and the school might ask for 75 percent of the SSS contribution , or $12,525 . As such , they would receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general financial aid budget . <p> In this case , the school studied and quantified the actual middle-class problem it was facing ( data-driven analyses , not anecdotal reflections ) and was able to fund the additional need created ( though still based on using an objective assessment as a baseline ) with funds that would not have otherwise been used to support lower-income/higher-need students . <p> Within this context of what it means to be middle class in independent schools , two sets of questions emerge that schools must face and discuss openly and strategically to accurately address the middle-class/ middle-income issue . <p> First , is it true that the independent school middle-income family ( however defined by individual schools ) is truly missing in our enrollment ? Is there significant research on the demographics of their entire populations to have the most accurate picture of the full economic diversity at the school ? <p> Second , if most American families would qualify for aid at independent schools ( from across a wide swath of low , middle , and high annual incomes  --  $0 to $100,000 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steady for the past decade at 16 to 17 percent of all students ? Clearly , the economics of financing independent schools dictate a need for a preponderance of full-pay families . Nonetheless , if schools can not sufficiently fund the 17 percent that currently receive aid ( very few schools meet full financial need for families that do receive financial aid ) , how can schools develop strategies to more aggressively subsidize the independent school middle-income cohort ? <p> Given tuition levels , income distribution in the U.S. , the sense of what it means to be middle class and what it means to be a middle-income independent school family , and the reality of how relatively few families receive financial aid in independent schools , it is time for schools to think more realistically about middle-class issues with respect to financial aid . Given the proper perspective on socioeconomic diversity and more specific data about our enrolled populations , we must use data-driven methods to objectively identify ( individually and collectively ) whether there really is a middle-class dearth in our schools . Furthermore , we must collectively approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the value of independent education , the return on their financial sacrifice , and financial-planning strategies they can explore in order to pay tuition commensurate with their true standing of being among the wealthiest families in the wealthiest country in the world . I 'm sure we can also find many examples of families in the middle-income range who are making it happen and doing so without financial aid or price discounts from the schools they 've chosen . <p> But if we discover that this segment of the population is squeezed in our school communities , schools must ask themselves how much they truly want this population , considering not only the financial implications , but also the cultural implications . In a diverse school community , what qualities do middle-income families bring ? How do these qualities strengthen the school ? If we get clarity on this , the financial strategies to attract such families  --  while protecting financial aid for low-income families  --  should be easier to develop .
