Rain Dogs By Sean Doolittle Random House Sean Doolittle ONE His first year at the paper , the best lead Tom wrote went like this : If Warren Giles had taken his coffee black on the morning of November 12 , the .45-caliber ricochet that killed him might have ruined the Starbucks sugar counter instead of his aorta . The best editor he 'd ever had sent that story back after rewriting the first sentence this way : If Tom Coleman had n't dreamed of writing sappy features , he might have made an okay cop reporter . Translation : The story is what happened . Not what might have happened if . In explaining a thing or two about good writing to a newsman from the cold type days , Tom had managed to argue his way out of his first byline . It had n't seemed fair at the time . Joyce Coleman hit the Coleman 's Landing like a Pine Sol tornado the first week in May . Tom walked down the hill to meet his folks when he heard their car roll in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother doffed her carryall , pulled him down by the neck , and squeezed the breath out of him . " Hi , Mom . " " My son the river rat . " He stood there , bent . " You 're crushing my windpipe . " She pushed back to arm 's length . " Let me see you . " Tom nodded to his dad , who brought up the rear a few steps behind . His mother touched a warm palm to his stubble . " You should shave , " she said . " Thanks . " " And shower . " She patted his cheek . Then she was off . Within the half hour , she 'd thrown open every window and started emptying cupboards . Tom walked back down the hill with his dad to bring up luggage . " Let her get it out of her system , " his dad said . " She 's been waiting a month for you to let her come help . " " I know . " Tom could n't explain why it had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the river itself , flowing around him . At the steps to the deck , Jack Coleman stopped and put down his suitcase . He put his hands on his hips and looked out at the river . He looked at Tom . " She 's worried about you . " " I know . " They both turned toward a sudden racket near one of the sheds , where Duane Foster pounded a piece of scrap metal with a hammer for some reason or other . " See you 've already got help . " " That 's just Duane , " Tom said . " He came with the place . " Foster said he 'd answered a job ad in the Omaha World-Herald three summers ago . According to Foster , Tom 's grandfather had paid him room , board , and minimum wage-in cash and off the books-from a few weeks before the tourist season started until a few weeks after it ended . Duane maintained the equipment and the vehicles , did whatever odd work around the place Tom 's grandfather told him to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the silver bus until the weather turned cold . He migrated back to Omaha for winter . Tom had n't seen the point in firing the guy . He had n't hired him in the first place . Foster claimed to have no other prospects , and Tom did n't know the first thing about the canoe business . His dad shook his head as though he 'd finally seen everything . " You 're going to live here , " he said . " Run this place . " " Until I figure out what else . " " Any ideas ? " " Money 's good for a while . " " I was n't asking about money . " " I do n't know , Dad . Write a novel . Maybe sell the place . See what happens . " His dad put his hand on the split-cedar railing , gave it a wiggle , seemed to find it sturdy . Directly above them , Tom 's mother leaned out a window . " Are you two going to stand around down there with your mouths open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way he did , a quick twitch at the corner of his mouth . They hauled the luggage upstairs , fell in , and followed orders . By nightfall , the three of them had turned over his grandfather 's spare living quarters above the arrival center from top to bottom . After every corner had been cleared of its cobwebs , every layer of dust taken up , every inch of pinewood mopped with oil soap and every rug shaken outside , Joyce Coleman put one arm around her husband , the other around Tom , surveyed her lemon-scented handiwork , and nodded . " Livable , " she said . *** Later , while Melissa had been carrying Grace , Tom had worked a slot on the investigative team that picked up a Renner Award and a few cordial death threats for a series on police graft . The best editor he 'd ever had , retired to Hilton Head by then , sent him another note : You 're a slow learner , Coleman , but you do come around . TWO He 'd just finished making coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The clock above the candy rack said half past eight . " That was quick . " " Yeah . Get this . " Duane was back from shuttling a young couple to the put-in at Fort Niobrara . At least that was where he was supposed to have left them . He also was supposed to have picked up a trio of game , giggle-prone older ladies who decided they 'd had enough paddling the previous day . The women had called by satellite phone an hour ago from their camp-over spot at Smith Falls . From his stool behind the counter , Tom could see the honeymooners through the big front windows , getting Cokes from the vending machine on the deck . He did n't see the golden girls anywhere . " State fuzz stopped us at the bridge , " Foster said . " They 're keeping people off up top . " Duane glanced at Tom 's dad , who leaned against the other side of the counter , sipping his coffee , seeming amused . " I mean , state cop . No offense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can call me Jack . " " No offense , Jack . " " None taken , Duane . " Tom 's sigh must have been audible . " County deputy blew past us on the way back , " Foster said . " Doing about ninety . " " What happened ? " " Some kind of explosion . One of the fishing cabins up there . " From the corner of his eye , Tom picked up the subtle change in his dad 's body language : the set of the jaw , the square of the shoulders . Forty-two years on the force , ten in command , all in a change of posture . " Where ? " " Saw a Game and Parks truck and a town cop turn off around the thirteen-mile marker . " " When ? " " Du n no . Statie said LifeNet choppered somebody to Lincoln already . " Jack Coleman sipped his coffee quietly . Foster nodded toward the couple out on the deck . " What do you want me to do with those two ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man do with them ? " " Your gramps ? Probably give them some money back or something . " " So I guess we 'll give them some money back or something . " " You could see if they 'd want to put in at the falls , " his dad suggested . " Float the bottom today . " Tom shrugged . " Tell them we 'll comp it . " " Got it , boss . " Tom did n't like it when Duane Foster called him boss . He 'd asked him to knock it off . " You 're on your way there anyway , right ? " Foster just looked at him . " Smith Falls . " Tom waited for it to sink in . " The Lauterbach party ? " " Shit . " " Relax . They 're not going anywhere . " Duane gave a sigh and hustled back outside . When they were alone again , Tom said , " It 's okay . You can go see if you want . " " Hm ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Things were n't exactly hopping at the Landing . According to Duane , it was early in the season . " No sense closing the place up , " his dad said . " Duane can handle things . " " Anyway . None of my business anymore . Local boys do n't need us poking our beaks in . " " Suit yourself . " Tom figured he 'd give it a minute . It took about half that long . " Guess I could make a call or two . See if I can find out what 's going on . You sure you do n't mind ? " " I said it 's fine . We 'd just be standing around here anyway . " His mom had driven into Valentine to spend the day with a friend she knew from Audubon , Nebraska ; they were planning a chapter trip to the Dry Tortugas . " We 'll go be bystanders . " Jack Coleman finished the last of his coffee and put the empty mug on the counter . He glanced at the lidded travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it contained anything other than coffee , he had n't mentioned it yet . Tom waited . " I 'll do the driving . " Tom reached under the counter and tossed him the keys . Neither of them said anything else for a bit . His dad finally nodded . " Guess we should go , if we 're going . " They went . *** They found the fishing camp , or what was left of it , a little over fifteen miles upriver . They 'd crossed the county line back into Cherry ; Tom 's dad estimated their position to be right along the eastern boundary of the refuge . Tom did n't see what difference it made , but that was his dad . Some retired men did the crossword ; Major John P. Coleman figured jurisdiction in his head . Tom paid more attention to the charred bones of the small cabin twenty yards off the north bank . They reached the spot in a tree-ringed clearing by a winding , rutted sand track . His dad pulled in behind a white Expedition with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counted two dark blue state cruisers , a county prowler , and a Game and Parks half-ton , all crowded together in fender-high grass . The shorter grass in the clearing had curled black almost to the tree line . The air still had a smoky , doused campfire smell . " Looks like the party 's over . " " We 'll just stay a minute . " Near the gutted skeleton of the cabin , Tom saw the Game and Parks man chatting with the man Tom took to be the sheriff . A deputy in the same brown uniform as the sheriff poked around the edges of the blackened lumber and ankle-deep ash . The two state troopers leaning against the trunk of the nearest cruiser watched Tom and his dad park . The larger of the two put on his hat and strolled over . Tom 's dad switched off the ignition and got out to meet him . Tom waited in the truck . He watched the trooper loosen his stance and shake his dad 's hand . The two of them chatted a bit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked in that direction . The trooper looked at the pickup , raised a wave in Tom 's direction . Tom decided he was already tired of sitting there . He got out and stretched his legs while his dad talked to the sheriff and the Game and Parks officer . He watched his dad wander over to the remains of the cabin and stand with his hands on his hips . Another handshake with the deputy there . While Tom waited , he noticed a charred piece of litter in the bromegrass near his feet . He nudged the scrap with his shoe . When he looked up , he saw his father moving back toward the truck , cell phone to his ear . Tom walked back and met him just as he folded the phone shut . " Was that Mom ? " A nod . " Lost the signal . We 'll meet her at the hospital in town . " " What 's going on ? " " Do n't know much , " he said . " Hop in , we 'll get moving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and got back in . He was curious , but the suspense was n't exactly killing him . And he knew his dad . He 'd hear about it on the way . According to Sheriff Roy Hilliard , three local teens had spent the night at the cabin , drinking beer and fishing , mostly drinking beer . The cabin had an old propane stove that vented out the center of the roof . Apparently , the stove had a leaky seal somewhere in the line . Two of the boys had been inside when the stove blew . The third boy , oldest of the trio , had been down the bank taking a leak . The cabin was already burning by the time he made it back ; he 'd pushed into the flames and the smoke and dragged the others outside to the water . He 'd had a cell phone with him but could n't get a signal , called for help using the CB radio in his pickup . He 'd then raced back and forth with five-gallon buckets of river water while one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with a twenty-pound fire extinguisher from the tool bed of the truck . They 'd kept at the edges of the blaze until grass rigs from the volunteer fire department arrived from town . Tom said , " You know the kids ? " " Ry Wheeler 's boys , two of them . " Tom did n't know Ry Wheeler or his boys . His dad did n't offer anything on the third kid . Tom did n't ask . " How bad ? " " Pretty bad , one of them . Ryland 's youngest , Morgan . That 's who they took to Lincoln . " Tom decided he might as well throw it out . " I wonder if he had sinus trouble . " " What makes you wonder that ? " " Found an empty Sudafed box in the grass , " he said . " Burned black on one side . Figure it came from the cabin . " Jack did n't say anything for a moment , and Tom did n't take the comment any further . No need . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what 's what . " They rode along . A couple miles from town , his dad said , " Just so you know , Scott Greer was out there , too . " " Who ? " There came another pause then , the kind you learned to sit through while Jack Coleman decided what he wanted to say . He finally said , " Worked the last couple summers for your grampa . " Tom said , " Oh . " When they got to the county hospital on the edge of Valentine , Tom saw his mother waiting for them out front . They parked in the center circle and got out of the truck . She hurried over , slinging her purse over a shoulder , her face pinched with concern . " Poor Abby , " she said . THREE Greer . The name had n't registered in the truck . Tom glanced at his dad , who only shrugged . Did n't see the point in making a drama out of it . As they hustled down an antiseptic hallway , following the directions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do n't play dense . " He could feel his mother watching him . He was n't trying to be difficult ; he just did n't know what she wanted him to say . He 'd expected the subject to come up at some point during the visit , but not like this . He was n't ready . And he was hung up on the math . " How does Abby have a teenage son ? " " Scott 's her stepson , " his dad said . " The fellow she married had two boys . " " Dan Greer , " his mother said . Continues ...
