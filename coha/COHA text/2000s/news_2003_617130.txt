<p> Bruce Wilkinson made a fortune and a name for himself when he told people that God would bless them by " enlarging their territory " if they recited the prayer of Jabez . <p> When Wilkinson followed his own advice , though , it led to one of the most wrenching transitions in his life . <p> Wilkinson , author of " The Prayer of Jabez , " was poised to go to Hollywood after his 2001 book sold 3 million copies and transformed him into a religious celebrity . <p> But the 54-year-old pastor shocked virtually everyone last year when he uprooted his family from his home in Atlanta and moved to South Africa to minister to AIDS orphans and victims . <p> Suddenly , the man who was accustomed to preaching to affluent Westerners was dealing with people who were n't trying to enlarge their territory  --  they were just trying to survive . <p> A South African woman approached Wilkinson one day to tell him that , though she had long been faithful to her husband , he had infected her with the virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now I 'm dying , " the woman told a stunned Wilkinson . " What did I do wrong ? " <p> Wilkinson talked about those experiences by phone from his hotel room in New York City , where he was promoting the release of his latest book , " The Dream Giver " ( Multnomah Publishers , $16.99 ) . The book follows the self-help path of " Jabez . " Its message : God gives everyone a dream and will " expand their borders " if they have faith . <p> Wilkinson said he wrote the book because he has seen so many people ignore their dreams . He wanted to give people practical tools for reaching them . <p> Most people refuse to follow their dreams , he believes , because they 're afraid . <p> " All dreams are in the land of the unknown ; you 've not been there yet , " he said . " The reality of feeling fear is completely normal . We think that when the fear goes away , we 'll go forward . You have to take courage while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He embarked on his own dream when he moved to Johannesburg , South Africa , last year . He created a new organization , Global Vision Resources , to fight the AIDS epidemic . Its solution to the AIDS epidemic : encouraging people to adopt AIDS orphans ; holding Bible teaching seminars to promote chastity and marital fidelity ; and teaching poor people to plant vegetable gardens to offset poverty . <p> Wilkinson has long maintained the Bible holds solutions to any problem . His optimism will be severely tested in Africa . <p> He says the AIDS epidemic has orphaned at least 13 million children across southern Africa . The pervasive poverty in Africa only deepened the misery caused by the epidemic . <p> Wilkinson was stunned when he entered the townships and rural villages there . <p> " I was never around that kind of suffering in my life , " he said . " In America , even the worst slums , they would say this is heaven . " <p> Preaching to people about realizing their dreams has been one of the most difficult challenges of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with people who truly do n't have hope because everything they tried has n't worked , " he says . " I literally saw shock on people 's faces as the idea begins to dawn on them that I do have a dream and I 've let it be murdered . " <p> Some of the shock Wilkinson encountered also came from white South Africans who wondered why he was moving to their country . <p> When he first flew into Johannesburg , Wilkinson said , he met a white South African family at the airport who were moving away and would never return because conditions were so bad . <p> " When I told them that I just moved here , you should have seen the look of utter shock on their face , " he says . <p> Crossroads in ministry <p> Moving to South Africa was n't originally part of Wilkinson 's plans . He made the move only after reaching a crossroads in his ministry . <p> After the success of " The Prayer of Jabez , " Wilkinson said he became convinced that God wanted him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los Angeles . Wilkinson wanted to make television and motion pictures from a Christian perspective . Los Angeles , he thought , would be a natural base . <p> Then he said he started receiving signs that God wanted him to go somewhere else . First when he flew to Los Angeles in 2002 with his wife , Darlene , to look for a house , they simply could n't find anything at all . <p> Then he went on a prearranged ministry trip to South Africa . That trip , he explained , revealed to him why God wanted him to move to Africa . <p> Before Africa , Atlanta was Wilkinson 's base of operations . He is the founder of Walk Thru the Bible ministries , an international Christian educational organization that uses Bible teaching seminars , devotional magazines and videos . The group , which had an annual budget of about $17 million when Wilkinson was president , has held biblical training seminars in 52 countries . <p> ' You are that man ' <p> But Wilkinson says he started getting restless at Walk Thru the Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rally in May 2002 , he says he received signs that he should stay . Once , while preaching about chastity and marital fidelity during a rally in South Africa , Wilkinson told the crowd that it only took one person to stand in the gap for Africa . <p> According to a Christianity Today magazine account of that rally , Wilkinson 's 28-year-old son , David , came up to him afterward and told him : " You are that man . " <p> Wilkinson had his doubts . He thought he was too old to make such a big move . He then met with some prominent South African Christians during the trip who told him that their country needed a Christian outsider with no agenda to gain people 's respect . <p> " You are that man , " one of the ministers told him . <p> Wilkinson stunned his colleagues at Walk Thru the Bible and resigned last year from the organization he created ( the Atlanta ministry declined to comment on Wilkinson 's resignation ) . He moved to South Africa in September of last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also had other motivations for moving to South Africa . Christianity is exploding in Africa , but so is Islam . In countries such as Nigeria , Christian pastors and Muslim imams are competing for new converts . <p> At one rally in West Africa , Wilkinson told Nigerian pastors to travel to the Muslim-dominated north in their country to evangelize  --  literally a life-risking endeavor . Wilkinson told the Nigerian pastors to preach among Muslims even if it cost them their life , according to Christianity Today . <p> Despite his public posture of confidence , Wilkinson says moving to South Africa was one of the most difficult decisions in his life . Most of his friends told him he was wrong . They said he was throwing away the success . They predicted disaster . <p> At times , Wilkinson wondered if they were right . When he arrived in Johannesburg , the change in cultures and needs of South Africa " overwhelmed " his family , he admitted . Wilkinson had moved his family  --  his wife , his son and his teenage daughter , Jessica , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married to a minister and still lives in Atlanta . <p> " When you realize the size of the problem in Africa , in those quiet moments , I think anyone would ask , ' Am I doing the right thing , ' " Wilkinson said . <p> Meeting people such as the woman whose husband gave her AIDS made him question his decision even more . What good is the prayer of Jabez for a victim of AIDS ? <p> Wilkinson says he first did n't know what to say to the woman . <p> " I could n't talk for a while , " he says . " I said , ' You did n't do anything wrong . You did n't deserve this . Sometimes the choices of others radically affect us . ' " <p> What ultimately helped Wilkinson , though , was the prayer of Jabez . He started pondering the hard truths in the prayer . Since his book was first published , the prayer had taken on a prosperity message  --  recite the prayer and God would grant you riches and personal happiness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to give tacit approval of that message . <p> In one Jabez passage , he writes : " When Christian executives ask me , ' Is it right for me to ask God for more business ? ' my response is , Absolutely ! If you 're doing your business God 's way , it 's not only right to ask for more , but he is waiting for you to ask . " <p> Prayer can lead to pain <p> But Wilkinson rejects the notion that the prayer is about securing prosperity . <p> " The prayer of Jabez obviously is n't magical , but is a way of putting into words the attitude God wants us to have , " Wilkinson said . " It is a matter of praying . . . . ' Please let me do more for you . Please increase my influence for you . Do whatever you need to in me and for me so that I do not hinder you . ' " <p> What Wilkinson discovered is that the prayer does n't automatically lead to prosperity . It can lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jabez is an extremely difficult way to live because you have to follow God wherever he asks you to go , " Wilkinson said . " Being sold out to the Lord is the most painful , exhilarating life there is . " <p> And that is precisely what Wilkinson has found in South Africa  --  pain and exhilaration . He has no plans to move back to the United States . <p> Africa is now Wilkinson 's new territory . <p> " I 'm growing roots in Africa , " he said . " I 've become attached to the people in Africa . I feel like this is the place I 'm supposed to be . "
