John says he does n't feel guilty about being at Havana 's sensual Tropicana stage show , especially since he 's there with his wife . All the same , he would rather not give his last name . A former State Department analyst from Virginia , John , 57 , often leads U.S. tourists on licensed exchange visits to communist Cuba . But the trips are supposed to be for educational purposes only , so John figures it 's best not to let the U.S. government know he 's enjoying a Las Vegas  --  style show whose scantily clad dancers cast nearly enough heat to relight his Cohiba cigar . When a Tropicana photographer offers John a complimentary shot of him smooching his wife , he declines , saying , " Better not let U.S. Customs see that . " <P> John and Fidel Castro too are betting that the customs hassles and permits required for travel to Cuba will become a thing of the past , perhaps as early as 2005 , a change Cuban tourism officials believe will bring more than 1 million U.S. turistas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the burgeoning bipartisan support Congress has shown this fall for lifting altogether the ban on travel to Cuba . The Bush Administration has been able to stall that effort for now  --  and as of Jan. 1 will outlaw exchange tours like John 's in order to tighten the U.S. economic embargo of Cuba . The U.S. clampdown could initially cost Cuba 50,000 American visitors each year , the number now traveling there legally on visas like John 's . But the 30,000 who go to Cuba illegally through third countries will probably continue to travel there , as will the 200,000 Cuban Americans who are allowed to visit relatives . And even Cuban exiles in Miami , the strongest backers of the 41-year-old embargo , say they do n't expect the travel ban to survive much beyond next year 's presidential election  --  that is , once George W. Bush no longer needs Florida votes . <P> What effect would millions of visitors from the citadel of capitalism have on a communist state of 11 million people ? Those in Congress who want to dump the travel ban argue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the island . Oswaldo Paya , Cuba 's leading dissident , finds that view naive . " I 'm all for the right of Americans to travel here , " he says , " but please do n't think Cuba will be democratized by people coming to dance salsa and smoke cigars . " <P> Nor are Cuban officials concerned that an American influx would mean a quick end to the Castro era . Says Rafael Dausa , head of the Cuban Foreign Ministry 's U.S. relations office : " An invasion of Americans will not destroy our revolution . We 're here because of the strength of our ideas . " If anyone 's views are changed by the meeting of the two peoples , he believes , it will be the Americans ' . " They 'll find out we do n't have horns or eat children , " he says .
