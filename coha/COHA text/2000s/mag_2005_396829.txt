Louis Armstrong before he was Satchmo ? A youthful Ella ? For photographs of musicians great or obscure , just about everyone turns to Frank Driggs <p> There 's a certain way jazz musicians from the 1930s pose for photographs , half-turned to face the camera , symmetrically arrayed around the bandleader , who can be identified by his regal smile and proximity to the microphone . Publicity stills of the period were the equivalent of English court paintings , hackwork intended to exalt their subjects and attract admiration to their finery . Bandleaders even took titles borrowed from the aristocracy : Duke Ellington , Count Basie , Earl Hines . . . well , Earl was actually the man 's given name , but he lived up to it in a way no tracksuited rap star could approach , no matter how big the diamond in his earlobe . There 's a picture of Hines with his band on the stage at the Pearl Theater in Philadelphia , exuding swank . Their suit pants , which bear stripes of black satin down the seams , break perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ span of a Madagascar fruit bat ; their hair is slicked . They were on top of their world . The year was 1932 , and about one in four Americans were out of work . <p> If Frank Driggs could go back in time and choose his year of birth , he would pick 1890 , so he would have been in his prime during the swing era , which he defines as roughly from the 1920s until its slow postwar decline into bebop and modernism . He was around for the very end of that era as a young man in New York City , and much of his life since then has been devoted to recapturing the spirit of those times , for which a stack of recordings as tall as a man is necessary hut not sufficient . The missing element is supplied by photographs , of which Driggs may be the world 's leading collector . In his office on the ground floor of an 1827 town house in Lower Manhattan are eight mismatched filing cabinets , holding folders crammed with trumpeters , trombonists and clarinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piano players , scat singers , percussionists and slap-bassists . These were the bands who made music for Decca and Victor , who played Roseland and Birdland , the Savoy and the Cotton Club , the Blue Note , the Blue Room and the Black Cat . Last year he found someone to count them , and the total came to something over 78,000 , including 585 of Count Basle , 692 of Benny Goodman , 1,083 of Louis Armstrong and 1,545 of Duke Ellington , which Driggs considers proportionate to Ellington 's stature . Pull out a drawer at random and Patti Page is followed by Charlie Parker , Cole Porter and Bud Powell , interspersed with the likes of Benny Peyton , a drummer whose four-decade career rates but one paragraph in the 1,300-page New Grove Dictionary of Jazz . " Who would know who Benny Peyton is ? " muses Driggs , a dry , understated man of 75 . One cabinet over , Duke Ellington 's great collaborator Billy Strayhorn goes in front of Barbra Streisand . " As well he should , " Driggs mutters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind of the Jazz Age writer William Bolitho 's description of the saxophone , endlessly sorrowful yet endlessly unsentimental : spare lists of hands and recordings and tours , ending , most often , in obscurity . The forgotten Peyton played all over Europe and South America in the 1920s and led hip own combo . He toured the Soviet Union with Sidney Bechet , the great clarinet player . " You could n't live like that today , " Driggs observes , lamenting the sharp decline in glamour attached to jazz musicians . A rock musician might approximate that kind of life , but he would have to listen to his own music , which Driggs considers an unbearable price to pay . <p> Another picture : Peyton 's contemporary , the alto sax player Rudy Jackson , who played with Duke Ellington , which for a sideman is like having been one of the guys manning the oars the day Jesus came aboard . But sometime after the recording of " East St. Louis Toodle-oo " in 1927 , Ellington replaced Jackson with the ( comparatively ) better-known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ceylon for the better part of a decade . " A lot of those bands went to India between the wars , " Driggs says . Moral : " Bands stayed together for a few months , then they 'd run out of bookings and break up . " <p> He reaches into a folder and extracts a photograph of a group called the John Kirby Sextet , which had a brief heyday in the late 1930s . The Grove dictionary notes their recording in 1938 of a song called " Rehearsin ' for a Nervous Breakdown . " The picture Driggs holds is from 1940 , when the sextet appeared at the Pump Room of Chicago 's Ambassador Hotel in blindingly white formal wear , shoes and grins . No shadow of a crease or pucker mars the perfect contours of their dinner jackets . Yet before the decade was out , Kirby would he playing bass and leading no-name pickup trios at a restaurant in Milwaukee . A few years after that , he would be dead at 44 ; of the six men in the 1940 photograph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a murky print of Kirby in his decline that looks as if the photographer had shot through a cloud of cigarette smoke . " That 's the nature of the music business , " Driggs says . " It 's good for a while , and then it 's sh-t . " <p> That wisdom sounds hard-won , but in fact Driggs himself earned a perfectly good living from the music business for most of his life . His secret was to avoid becoming a musician . Growing up in a small town in Vermont , where his family managed a resort hotel , and later in the New York suburbs , he listened to jazz on the radio . He learned the trumpet by playing along with recordings , a hobby he still pursues , sometimes while sitting in his car waiting for a parking spot to open on his block . After graduating from Princeton in 1952 he became a regular at theaters and clubs and ballrooms from Greenwich Village to Harlem , " before they all closed and became bowling , alleys . " He was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Columbia , specializing in rereleases of classic 78s . Along the way he built up his collection of memorabilia and photographs , mostly publicity stills and amateur snapshots by friends and acquaintances . Since 1977 , be has made most of his living off reproduction fees from the collection , which was recently appraised at $1.5 million . Almost any jazz reference book published in recent years has relied on it , as did the Ken Burns documentary series on jazz . The course of Driggs ' life was determined by his inability to read music , which kept him from playing professionally He got to know a lot of famous musicians , but , he says , " I did n't drink enough to hang out with them . " Mostly he was a family man who went home at the end of the day , or at least before the end of the night , to his wife and four stepchildren in Brooklyn . <p> The musicians led uncertain , peripatetic lives ; as an afternoon browsing Driggs ' archive proves . The white-suited piano player in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Mills Blue Rhythm Band ( not to be confused with the Mills Brothers ) in 1937 . Joe Garland played saxophone with the Mills band , and Edgar Hayes played piano . By 1938 Hayes had formed his own group , taking Garland with him . Driggs has a photograph of them touring Stockholm in matching overcoats and fedoras . Also in that picture was trombonist Clyde Bernhardt , who can be seen in a picture from 1943 , at the Ubangi Club in New York , with the horn player Cecil Scott , who shows up with his nine sidemen in a 1929 picture of Cecil Scott 's Bright Boys . That picture includes trombonist Dicky Wells , who in 1937 was photographed at the Apollo playing with Teddy Hill 's band , whose saxophone player was Russel Procope , who three years later shows up back where we started , with the John Kirby Sextet . Sooner or later , everyone played with everyone else , because they either quit for more money or got fired for asking for more money or woke up someplace strange and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in the pictures . <p> Not just the pictures , though ; a lot of it is in Driggs ' head , which is why he hopes to find an institution to buy the collection , relieving him of running the business as well as providing support for the necessary cataloging and conservation work . The photographs and recordings will survive , but Driggs is of the last generation with firsthand memories of these groups . For that matter , they were past their prime even by the time he got to hear them . " When I heard Teddy Wilson 35 years ago , he was nothing like he was back in the 1930s and ' 40s , " Driggs says . " By then he was supporting three or four ex-wives and just going through the motions . " Things have n't gotten any better , in Driggs ' view . In the handful of clubs that even New York City can sustain , the white guys play Dixieland and the black musicians want to emulate Miles Davis or John Coltrane , an ambition that baffles Driggs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play a 40-minute solo at the Apollo and the audience would walk out . " ( Driggs does , however , possess around 100 photographs of Davis , and half that many of Coltrane . ) In all of New York City today there are exactly two groups that meet Driggs ' standards . On Tuesday nights , he goes out with his lady friend Joan Peyser ( author of an acclaimed biography of Leonard Bernstein ) to a place in Midtown Manhattan to hear Vince Giordano and His Nighthawks , a big band in the classic style . On Monday nights , they go to a club in Chelsea , where they listen to Kevin Dorn and His Jazz Collective , a sextet that plays instrumental and vocal standards from the ' 20s and ' 30s . Dorn is a personable young drummer , and his group includes some talented musicians . Driggs thinks they could dress with a little more class  --  they mostly wear sports jackets over open-necked shirts , the occasional fedora or newsboy cap-though he recognizes the impracticality of expecting them to keep a dinner jacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they launch into " Exactly Like You " or " When Dreams Come True , " if you close your eyes and conjure up the smell of smoldering tobacco and spilled bourbon drying on the tablecloth , you might imagine yourself back at the Famous Door hearing Benny Morton and Walter Page swap solos , with a guy on drums who played with a guy who played with Ellington . <p> A sideman puts down his horn and sings " When I Take My Sugar to Tea " in careful measures , uncannily evoking the reedy tones of an early 78 . The saxophonist launches into his eight-bar apotheosis , the high-hat does its stutter-step , and Driggs and Peyser hold hands through " East of the Sun , West of the Moon . " They sit in the front , close to the bandstand , and as long as they do n't look behind them , they can ignore the fact that hardly anyone else is in the room . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : " He was an incredible piano player , the most fantastic in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York City ) says of Earl Hines ( at the microphone with his band in Philadelphia in 1932 ) .
