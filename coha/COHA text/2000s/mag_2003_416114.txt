To keep the test simple we did n't include ultralight touring or alpine skis . Instead , we pounded out laps on telemark-specific skis in the all-terrain and big mountain categories . After two days , our testers came back with strong opinions . With their reviews , you 'll find a power/finesse scale ( showing if a ski responds better to muscle or subtler technique ) , a performance chart ( see definitions below ) for you stat geeks , the lowdown on three tiers of boots , and the inside scoops on the newest bindings . Now , go grab a fat setup and we 'll see you out there . TURNS ( 1-10 SCALE ) BIG ... ALL HERE ARE THE CRITERIA USED TO ... MOUNTAIN ...

TURN EXECUTION : Does the ski startX the turn without heavily weighting the tip , or does it need coaxing to get on edge ? HARD-SNOW GRIP : Does the ski bite X and carve ( with no chatter ) on hard snow ? SPEED ( 1-10 SCALE ) SPEED RATING : Does the ski give you the confidence to arc long and short turns at high speeds ? STABILITY AT SPEED : At speeds over 30 miles per hour , is the ski damp and stable or squirrelly ? OFF-PISTE ( 1-10 SCALE ) POWDER : Does the ski float or nosedive in the fresh ? Does it have a big sweet spot or do you have to work to stay balanced ? CRUD &; BROKEN SNOW : Does the ski blast through crust ? Is it stable in junk , or unpredictable ? LONG TURNS : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long turns ? * 1actored in All-Terrain composite scores only . MOGULS : Is the ski quick in the troughs and forgiving over the tops ?

SHORT TURNS : Does the ski zing into short-radius turns and snap out of them ? SKIS TESTERS ' CHOICE SKIING mountain grown ! Big MOUNTAIN As with alpine skis , big mountain tele boards are getting fatter by the year . And this year 's fatties are the plumpest yet . They can float over the deepest snow , plow through the nastiest chunks , and hang on to the scariest steeps . Just do n't expect to go Ginsu carving on the hardpack.  --  EVELYN SPENCE SKI .............. POWER/FINESSE SPEED ..... TURN .....

With Beta Technology  --  two parallel tubelike cores made of dense foam  --  borrowed from Atomic 's alpine stable , the ski never goes noodley , and its stability is off the charts . GRIPES : Novices  --  and skiers who prefer soft-flexing boots  --  ca n't generate enough force to set a solid edge . PROPS : Plowed through the thickest , chunkiest muck we could find .

Turn initiation is on the slow side , but it 's just right for going fast in variable snow . GRIPES : The bulky plastic tip can catch the other ski during tele transitions . PROPS : Unwavering , no matter how high you jack the speedometer . TESTER 'S TAKE : " Vegetarians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast , aggressive skiers only .

But one thing has n't changed : The Work Stinx is still one of the quickest , most agile fat skis on the market  --  which makes it a good multitool for someone who splits time between the resort and the backcountry . If you slog uphill on a regular basis , it wo n't drag you down . GRIPES : Since it 's so light , it deflects easily at high speeds in rough conditions . PROPS : Came out tops for maneuverability  --  and it 's pontoon-like in the deep stuff . TESTER 'S TAKE : " A forgiving super cruiser in deep pow.

Just keep it away from hard snow . Although it 's wide enough to smooth over broken crud and agile enough to maneuver down narrow steeps , it 's about as edgy as Michael Bolton .

And it 's surprisingly agile for a fatty. "  --  Molly Douma Test Lengths ( cm ) : 170 , 180 , 190 Tip/Waist/Tail ( mm ) : 120/90/110 , 127/97/117 TESTERS ' CHOICE SKIING mountain grown !

GRIPES : Straightliners may find the narrow waist a bit twitchy . PROPS : With both edge-to-edge quickness and stability at speed , it eats moguls for breakfast and GS turns for lunch . TESTER 'S TAKE : " It sliced on lunch-tray ice and made crud actually carvable. "  --  Evelyn Spence Test Lengths ( cm ) : 170 , 180 Tip/Waist/Tail ( mm ) : 106/72/98 2 BLACK DIAMOND CROSSBOW $549 Aggressive off-piste skiers find that the Crossbow 's 82-mm waist provides an ample platform for popping out of crud trenches .

A 76-mm waist ( tops for versatility in our book ) stays solid underfoot when blasting from icy groomers into chunky crud . GRIPES : If you 're not balanced , its firm shovel can toss you into the backseat . PROPS : A little extra beef in the flex eliminates tip and tail flop . TESTER 'S TAKE : " Plowability .

Lightweight skiers with less power will love how easily it rolls on edge . GRIPES : The soft-flexing tail washes out on hard snow . PROPS : Thanks to its wider , 78-mm waist , the new World Piste rebounds like a trampoline in powder . TESTER 'S TAKE : " Like a phat Corvette  --  wide and stable .

Since shin bang and bone spurs should not be part of the genuflecting sport , we 've assembled nine models that ease unnecessary suffering and boost performance . Determine what kind of freeheeler you are , test drive a couple pairs if you can , then hit the hill and get the good hurt on .  --  LINDSAY YAW Race BOOTS 1 GARMONT ENER-G $579 As part of the 03-04 overhaul , the Ener-G gets a thicker liner , but still comes in as the widest boot on the market . ( Folks with narrow feet might want to try the G-Fit with its heat-moldable liners . ) Garmont designers also beefed up the overall flex of the triple-injected plastic shell . Its unyielding body , robust chassis , and soft bellows make for precise turning and ferocious edge hold . garmontusa.com 2 CRISPI CXU $565 The CXU is all about customization  --  a nice touch in a tele boot . Bowlegged or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for better edge control . You can even select from three forward lean positions , depending upon skiing style and conditions . But take note , this is not a lightweight skier 's boot ; the stiff , full-length carbon insert can not be removed . alpinasports.com 3 SCARPA T-RACE $498 Once again the tallest and stiffest tele boot , the T-Race still caters to those who kick up flecks of ice with each turn . This year Black Diamond added a hard plastic beam that wraps around the ankle for increased torsional support , and  --  instead of swapping in a lightweight liner , as other companies have  --  chose not to mess with the heavy-duty original liner . bdel.com All MOUNTAIN 4 GARMONT GARA $389 Although the Gara is the lightest boot in the all-mountain category , it has a slightly higher cuff this year , providing extra stability for ripping brawny terrain . It 's still lower than a race boot , however , making it ideal for both hiking off area  --  and dropping scraped-off inbounds chutes. garmontusa.com 5 CRISPI CXR $510 To make the CXR the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the instep , heel , and arch in a stiffer plastic , added a fourth buckle , and grew the cuff a half-inch taller for more control when screaming down cruisers or wiggling through OB trees . They also made the toe box and upper cuff softer for a more progressive forward flex . alpinasports.com 6 SCARPA T1 $479 The T1 is the most refined telemark boot on the market . Since its debut in 1992 , it 's been tweaked , lightened ( thanks in part to a heat-moldable custom liner ) , and stiffened for control both on-piste and off . New micro-adjustment buckles make clamping down the feet easy even in sub-zero temps , and a torsion wrap around the heel increases lateral stability for , say , whipping jump turns . bdel.com Crossover/BACKCOUNTRY 7 GARMONT SYNER-G/SYNER-G G-FIT $425/$459 Geared toward ski mountaineering  --  more than the rest of the crew , at least  --  the Syner-G fuses big-hill sturdiness with a sleeping bag-plush liner . This year , Garmont thickened the tongue to lessen shin bang during long approaches or steep descents . Tip : The heat-moldable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garmontusa.com 8 CRISPI CXP $435 Because the CXP is only a half inch shorter than Crispi 's race boot , it 's one the most stable backcountry boots around . But a forgiving flex , three buckles instead of four , and no Al Gore- stiff insert make it more than smooth enough for touring . alpinasports.com 9 SCARPA T2 $435 If you hit the lifts only on high-avy-danger days and most of your hill time is spent skinning up backcountry peaks , then opt for the T2 . A removable spoiler lowers the cuff for a more natural walking stride  --  reattach it on the summit so you do n't have to sacrifice downhill performance . Also available in a narrower , lower-cuffed female version . bdel.com BINDINGS TESTERS ' CHOICE SKIING mountain grown ! The days of one-binding-suits-all are over . Savvy knee-droppers now match skis , boots , and bindings to make rippin ' ' , condition-specific setups . Below , a quick cheat sheet to help with the matchmaking.  --  EVELYN SPENCE 1 ALL-AROUNDER BLACK DIAMOND 03 $140 The new 03 has the same basic design  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of varying stiffness  --  as the 02 , Black Diamond 's high-performance , higher-priced , on-piste binding . But with cable exits positioned farther forward for an easy toe pivot , the 03 excels on smooth touring routes as well as inbounds. bdel.com 2 TIME-TESTED CLASSIC G3 TARGA $139 The Targa returns unchanged from ' ' 02 , featuring the same durable , clean design : a 21-mm shim , anti-ice plates , angled cable guides that prolong cable life , and a convenient one-size-fits-all cable . Fine-tune the pressure exerted on the ski tip with one of four sets of springs ( use the Powder springs for zero tip dive , the Race for quickest turn initiation ) . If you 're a zealot about weight , consider the $179 aluminum T/9 's , which trim almost half a pound . genuineguidegear.com 3 SAFE BET KARHU 7tm $209 If you want insurance against knee tweaks and the peace of mind that comes from knowing your anchor-like skis will rip off in an avalanche , try the 7tm , with a DIN-calibrated side-release mechanism . As for performance , a flexible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full metal bar , but it allows the boot to bend naturally for , Karhu claims , a smooth turn . karhu.com 4 MOUNTAIN BRUTE LINKEN $229 The heavy metal in the Linken would put Metallica 's Summer Sanitarium Tour to shame . With a full plate , a step-in heel , and the most torsional rigidity this side of an alpine binding , it should transfer all your power straight to the snow . And it definitely stands up to alpine-style launches : Scandinavians have been using the Linken to huck monster telecopters for years . indigoequipment.com 5 JACK-OF-ALL-TRADES RAINEY HAMMERHEAD $210 With sliding cable guides underfoot , the HammerHead is like a six-in-one value meal . Bump the guides all the way back to position five , where the pivot point lands under the boot 's arch , for power and control on ice . Move them forward to position one , under the toe , for a sensitive feel in bottomless powder . Remove them altogether for a free-hinging hike . raineydesigns.com 6 CARVER ROTTEFELLA COBRA R8 $165 The burliest of the three new Cobra R-Series bindings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to decrease lateral wiggle ) and comes with the stiffest Rottefella springs to date . The extra-long spring cartridges allow for deep , knee-to-topsheet turns , and the wide riser plates aim to improve edge control . For softer snow turns in the backcountry , try the R4 's easier flexing cables and springs . garmont.com 7 PISTE TO OFF-PISTE VOIL VP-II $140 The VP-II , a plate binding with a hinge in it , combines the torsional rigidity of a full-plate setup ( like the Linken ) with a more merciful flex ( like the Targa ) to function well on hard snow inbounds and the summit traverse out back . This year , an aluminum knob at the heel lets you adjust spring tension on the fly  --  loose for touring , tight for on-piste ripping . voile-usa.com ASK : DR . FLAKE WHAT 'S UP WITH TWIN-TIP TELE SKIS ? Karhu introduced them to " make the statement that free-healing is n't stuck in the leather-boot , wool-knicker past , " says Karhu 's Charlie Lozner . Sure enough , park and pipe telemarkers now agree with Lozner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . ASK : DR . FLAKE ARE CUSTOM LINERS A GOOD IDEA FOR TELE BOOTS ? Crimony , are there no leather-booted granola-head tele skiers left ? We alpine folk bequeathed you plastic shells a few years ago , but did that satisfy you ? Nooooo . Now , drunk on technical progress , you demand our liners , too . Alrighty then . Skiers who hike a lot in sub-zero temps like custom , heat-moldable liners for warmth and fewer blisters . Those who carve inbounds terrain should stick with the stock , alpine-type liners  --  they 're stiffer and therefore improve energy transfer ( keeping Mr. Tele upright on icy turf ) . ASK : DR . FLAKE WHAT 'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PLATE BINDINGS AND CABLE BINDINGS ? The plate guys say modern , aggro telemark skiing calls for a torsionally stiff binding and step-in convenience . Cable guys counter that plates are needlessly heavy and that a cable binding promises more free , natural flex . Plate guys insist that their mechanical flex point works fine and that users can adjust their pre-load . The cable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use plates , so you 'll never find spare parts when you need " em . Which makes Dr. Flake throw up his hands and cry , " Ca n't we all be brothers ?
