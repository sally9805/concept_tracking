A Portland couple achieves a graceful evolution Photograph For their front porch ( above left ) , Joann Le and David Horsley designed double wood columns to reduce the mass and add detailing . At the rear ( above right ) , they built seating into the railing . // All over the West , homeowners are renovating old bungalows . Some meticulously mimic the original architecture ; others create strikingly contemporary additions , sharply contrasting old and new . Architects Joann Le and David Horsley , a Portland couple , chose yet another approach . " We treated the renovation with a subtle touch that imbued a modern sensibility while respecting the home 's character , " says Horsley . And perhaps most important , they kept a good sense of humor along the way . " With two architects in the house , there was no restraining voice of reason , " laughs Horsley . " We turned a little fixer into a significant fixer . " The couple has spent the last six years gradually transforming their 1913 bungalow from a collection of small , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They did almost all of the work themselves-even making much of the furniture . " We certainly wish we had bought stock in Home Depot , " says Le . One of their first decisions was to remove a wall that divided a small kitchen and a tiny downstairs bedroom . Horsley had fond memories of the large kitchen and eating area in his grandmother 's home , and he and Le wanted a similarly gracious space . " We use the kitchen in a modern way , " explains Le . " We cook , eat , do the bills , and read the paper there . " By opening up the room with large double-hung windows and a glass door , they gained access to sunlight and views . Key to the success of the kitchen is a new rear porch that expands the area into the backyard . The couple finished it with the same fir flooring used inside , protecting the exposed section with spar urethane , a marine-grade finish available at most paint and hardware stores . To ensure that the porch ceiling would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skylights between the rafters , giving them the best of both worlds . A series of openings in the interior walls lets in additional sunlight . " We 're not sun worshippers or even beach people , " Le says with a smile , " but capturing the light is really important to us . " To achieve the same goals on the second floor , the couple added a shed dormer to the rear of the house-giving them more light and garden views while enlarging bedrooms and creating space for an upstairs bathroom . To complete the dormer , which involved removing half the roof , they took several days off from work . " We lived in the front while the back of the house was a convertible , " says Horsley . They can laugh now , but with a Northwest fall quickly approaching , the pressure to complete the dormer was intense . " In one weekend , Joann and I ripped off the roof and did the demo work , " says Horsley . The house sat exposed to the elements for a week . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a builder they hired to work alongside them-framed the walls and put up some beams . Two days later , they finished the rafters , and in another two days they had a roof again . Photograph The biggest changes to the home are visible at the rear , where a new wide dormer rises above a skylit porch . Concrete pavers edge the patch of grass like a painting 's frame . // In the backyard , a rectangle of grass- " which our friends refer to as surreal , " says Horsley-occupies the center . " We like having a slash of green that you see from the inside , " says Le . The grass is surrounded with concrete pavers in various sizes that Horsley set in sand in a repeating geometric pattern . Running the length of the backyard is an elevated planting area , which the couple filled with woodland plants-vine maples , hellebores , and maidenhair ferns . Though Le and Horsley feel that the results have been more than worth it , they are the first to admit that doing a major portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those moments , " says Le , " we took solace from an old Japanese proverb : House done , life over . " DESIGN : Joann Le and David Horsley , DAO Architecture , Portland ( 503/230-0664 ) Makeover details * The home office occupies part of the wide dormer ( A ) , with a built-in desk and open storage compartments running under the long band of windows . * The kithcen cabinets ( B ) are white plywood boxes with fir veneer plywood doors . The countertop material is Durat ( www.durat.com ) , a Finnish product made with 50 percent recycled plastic . * The built-in seating on the back porch ( C ) eliminates the need for a railing and gives the porch an uncluttered look . " Plus , if you can sit on the rail , it makes the porch that much larger , " says Horsley . * The master bedroom ( D ) shares the dormer with the home office ; an interior window and door allow each space to borrow light from the other . * The kitchen opens to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large table . The table legs are painted white to match the walls , ceiling , and cabinet trim . * The horizontal front porch railing ( F ) extends down the stairway and contrasts handsomely with the honey-toned wood of the flooring . " The railing is an extension of what we have done in and around the house : simple designs that have clean lines and are easy to build , " says Le .

" For both cost reasons and a desire to be sustainable , we reused a lot of materials from the house and augmented with recycled products , " says Le . Reclaimed flooring from old schoolhouses , vintage door hardware , and salvaged lighting fixtures " give the renovated areas a patina of age that blends more seamlessly with the old . " * Unify and brighten . White walls and fir floors provide continuity between the spaces . " We chose white because it has a lot of reflectivity , and we wanted to maximize the light as much as possible , " explains Le . // <p>
