Loneliness was everywhere . Hopelessness and an air of foreboding had settled over the western shores , casting their pall over land , sea and the mountain of Salamandastron . Yet nobeast knew the cause of it . A pale moon of early spring cast its wan light down upon the face of the mighty deeps , touching each wind-driven wavetop with flecks of cold silver . Soughing breakers crashed endlessly upon the strand , weary after their journey from the corners of the earth . Above the tideline , gales chased dry sand against the rocks , forcing each particle to sing part of the keening dirge that blended with the sounds of the dark ocean . In his chamber overlooking the scene , Lord Stonepaw sat in his great chair , feeling as ancient as the mountain he ruled . In one corner , his bed stood neatly made , unused now for a score of seasons . He was far too old ; the ritual of lying down each night and rising next day had become painful for his bones . Drawing his cloak tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squinted rheumily out to sea , worrying constantly about his domain . Without bothering to knock , a venerable hare creaked his way into the chamber , leaning heavily upon a small serving cart which he was pushing before him . Stonepaw 's efforts to ignore him were of no avail . He fussed hither and thither , like a broody hen with only one chick , chunnering constantly as he went about his chores . " Mmmm , no fire lit again , eh , m' lud ? Catch your death o ' cold one night y'will , mark m'words ! " Sparks from the flint he was striking againsta blade , coupled with his wheezy blowing , soon had a flame from dry moss crackling against pine twigs . " Hmmm , that 's better , wot ? C'm on , get this supper down . You 've got to blinkin ' well eat to live , y'know ! " Stonepaw shook his head at the sight of the food his servant was laying out on the small table at his side . " Leave me alone , Fleetscut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ y'wo n't , sire , you 'll flippin ' well have it now ! I ai n't goin ' t'the bother o ' luggin ' vittles from the kitchen to watch you let ' em go cold . Hot veggible soup an ' fresh bread , that 'll do you the world o ' good , wot ! " The ancient badger sighed with resignation . " Oh , give your tongue a rest . I 'll take the soup . Bread 's no good t'me , though . Too crustyhurts my gums . " Fleetscut brooked no arguments . Drawing his dagger , he trimmed the crusts from the still oven-warm loaf . " No crusts now , wot ? Dip it in your soup , m' lud . " The hare perched on the chair arm , helping himself to soup and bread , in the hope that it might encourage his master 's appetite . Stonepaw snorted mirthlessly . " Huh , look at us . Me , Stonepaw , hardly able to hold a spoon with the same paws that used to lift huge boulders , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " The hare nudged his old friend and cackled . " Heh heh heh ! Mebbe so , but I can still remember the days when I could leap three times as high as that trolley , aye , an ' run from dawn to dusk without stoppin ' to draw breath . Was n't a bally hare on the mountain could even stay with my dust trail ! Those were the seasons , wot ! You , too , Stonepaw . I saw you lift boulders bigger'n yourself when we were young , you could break spears an ' bend swords with your bare paws ... " Stonepaw gazed at the paws in question . " That may have been , my old messmate , but look at my paws now , silver-furred , battered , scarred and so full of aches and pains that they 're no good for anything ! " Fleetscut hauled himself from the chair arm and went to lean at the long window overlooking the sea . " So what 's the blinkin ' problem ? Everybeast has t'grow old , nothin ' can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good life , you'n'me , fought our battles , protected the western coast against all comers , an ' never once backed off from any fight . There 's been peace now for as long as any creature on the mountain can remember . What 're you worryin ' about , sire ? " With a grunt , Stonepaw rose slowly from his chair and joined his companion at the window . He stared out at the darkened waters as he replied . " Peace has gone on too long . Something inside me says that trouble such as these shores have never known is headed our way . I wished that we could live our days out without having to take up arms again , Fleetscut , but deep down I 'm stone cold certain it wo n't happen . Worst part of it is that I ca n't even guess what the future holds . " Fleetscut looked strangely at the Badger Lord , then shuddered and went to warm himself by the fire . " Sire , I know exactly how you feel . Matter o ' fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when old Blench the cook said to me : Looks like evil comin ' soon . ' She says : See for yourself , there ai n't a sight or sound of a single bird anywhere on land or sea ! ' " Lord Stonepaw stroked his long silver beard thoughtfully . " Blench was right , too , now you come to mention it . Where do you suppose all the birds have gone ? The skies are usually thick with gulls , cormorants , petrels and shearwaters in late spring . " Fleetscut shrugged expressively . " Who knows what goes on in the mind of a seabird ? Maybe they know things we do n't . Stands t'reason , though , sire , why should they hang about if they know somethin ' bad is due to come here ? " The badger smiled at his faithful old friend . " Why indeed ? They have no duty to protect this coast and they can always build nests elsewhere . Leave me now , I 'll talk to you on the morrow . There are things I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord 's authority , and was not about to do so now . Bobbing a stiff bow he left the chamber , pushing his trolley . Lord Stonepaw made his way to the secret chamber where countless other Badger Rulers of Salamandastron had gone to dream mysterious dreams . It was a place that would have made the hairs on any other creature 's back stand stiff . Ranged around the walls of the inner chamber were lines of little carvings , telling of the mountain 's history . Guarding it in fearsome armored array stood the mummified bodies of past Badger Warriors : Urthrun the Gripper , Spearlady Gorse , Bluestripe the Wild , Ceteruler the Just and many other legendary figures . From his own lantern , Stonepaw lit three others . Then , taking a pawful of herbs from a shell he sprinkled them into the lantern vents . As the sweet-smelling incense of smoke wreathed him , he sat down upon a carved rock throne . Closing both eyes , he breathed in deeply and let his mind take flight . After a while he began speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me soon , if the shadow of evil darkens our western shores , who will serve in my stead ? My hares are scattered far and wide . Peacetime makes young warriors restless ; they are gone questing afar for adventure . Only the old guard are left here with me on this mountain , dim of eye and feeble of limb , the seasons of their strength long flown . " Lord Stonepaw 's eyes began flickering , and the herbal smoke swirled about his great silver head as he sat up straight , his voice echoing around the rockbound cavern . " Where is the strongest of the strong ? Who can be so perilous that a force of fighting hares will rise and follow that creature ? Is there a badger roaming the earth brave and mighty enough to become Lord of Salamandastron ? " Outside on the strand , the gale increased , waves crashed widespread on the tideline in their effort to conquer the land , like a maddened beast the ocean roared . Sand swept upward into winding columns , driving , spiraling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of birds or any other living thing to be heard . A foreboding of great evil lay over the land and sea . But nobeast knew the cause of it . ... Yet .
