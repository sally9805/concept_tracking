Even though she was listening to Christmas carols on her iPod , Mary Jo Wyse could hear her brothers arguing . How could she not ? Individually , the three of them had voices that were usually described as booming ; together they sounded like an entire football stadium full of fans . All three worked as mechanics in the family-owned car repair business and stood well over six feet . Their size alone was intimidating . Add to that their voices , and they 'd put the fear of God into the most hardened criminal . <p> " It 's nearly Christmas , " Linc was saying . He was the oldest and , if possible , loudest of the bunch . <p> " Mary Jo said he 'd call her before now , " Mel said . <p> Ned , her youngest brother , remained suspiciously quiet . He was the sensitive one . Translated , that meant he 'd apologize after he broke David Rhodes 's fingers for getting his little sister pregnant and then abandoning her . <p> " We 've got to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice gave her pause . Mary Jo 's situation was complicated enough without the involvement of her loving but meddlesome older brothers . However , it was n't their fault that she was about to have a baby and the father was nowhere in sight . <p> " I say we find David Rhodes and string him up until he agrees to marry our sister . " <p> Mary Jo gasped . She could n't help it . Knowing Linc , he 'd have no qualms about doing exactly that . <p> " I think we should , too  --  if only we knew where he was , " she heard Mel say . <p> Unable to sit still any longer , Mary Jo tore off her earphones and burst out of her bedroom . She marched into the living room , where her brothers stood around the Christmas tree , beers in hand , as its lights blinked cheerfully . Ever since their parents had been killed in a car accident five years earlier , her older brothers had considered themselves her guardians . Which was ridiculous , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had n't been legally of age at the time of their deaths , but her brothers seemed to forget she was now an adult . <p> All four of them still lived in the family home . Linc and Ned were currently seeing women , but neither relationship seemed very serious . Mel had recently broken up with someone . Mary Jo was the only one eager to leave , chafing as she did at her brothers ' attempts to decree how she should live her life . <p> Admittedly she 'd made a mess of things ; she could n't deny it . But she was trying to deal with the consequences , to act like the adult she was . Yes , she 'd made a massive error in judgment , falling for an attractive older man and doing what came all too naturally . And no , she did n't need her brothers ' assistance . <p> " Would you guys mind your own business , " she demanded , hands on her hips . At five-three she stared up at her brothers , who towered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although at the moment <p> her appearance was the least of her problems . She was dressed in her old flannel nightgown , the one with the Christmas angels on it , her belly stretched out so far it looked like she 'd swallowed a giant snow globe . Her long dark hair fell in tangles , and her feet were bare . <p> Linc frowned back at her . " You 're our sister and that makes you our business . " <p> " We 're worried about you , " Ned said , speaking for the first time . " You 're gon na have that baby any day . " <p> " I do n't know nothin ' about birthing no babies , " Mel added in a falsetto voice . <p> If he was trying to add humor to the situation , Mary Jo was n't amused . She glared at him angrily . " You do n't have to worry about delivering my baby . This child is my concern and mine alone . " <p> " No , he is n't . " <p> From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months ago , her brothers had decided the baby was a boy . For some reason , the alternative never seemed to occur to them , no matter how often she suggested it . <p> " You 're depriving this baby of his father , " Linc said <p> stubbornly . It was a lament he 'd voiced a hundred times over the past months . " A baby needs a father . " <p> " I agree , " Mary Jo told him . " However , I have n't seen David in weeks . " <p> Mel stepped forward , his disapproval obvious . " What about Christmas ? Did n't he tell you he 'd be in touch before Christmas ? " <p> " He did . " But then David Rhodes had made a lot of promises , none of which he 'd kept . " He said he 'd be visiting his family in the area . " <p> " Where ? " Ned asked . <p> " Cedar Cove , " she supplied and wondered if she should 've told her three hotheaded brothers that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , " Linc said . <p> Mary Jo held up both hands . " Do n't be crazy ! " <p> " Crazy , " Linc echoed with a snort of indignation . " I refuse to let you have this baby alone . " <p> " I 'm not alone , " Mary Jo said . She gestured toward them . " I have the three of you , do n't I ? " <p> Her brothers went pale before her eyes . " You you want us in the delivery room ? " Mel asked in weak tones . He swallowed visibly . " You 're joking , right ? " <p> Mary Jo had delayed registering for the birthing classes because David had promised to attend them with her . Only he had n't managed to show up for the first session or the one after that or the following one , either . Giving up on him , Mary Jo had begun a session that week  --  a lot later in the pregnancy than she should have . She 'd gone by herself and left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he 'd be her birthing partner , she had n't found the courage to do it yet . And she was n't sure he 'd be the best choice , anyway . Her other options were her girlfriends Casey and Chloe ; however , Casey was terrified by the idea and Chloe , married last year , was expecting her own baby . <p> " Right . " She struggled to maintain her composure . " That was a joke . " <p> They released a collective sigh . <p> " You 're distracting us from what 's important here . " Obviously , Linc was n't going to be put off . " I want to talk to David Rhodes , just him and me , man to man . " He clenched his hands at his sides . <p> " And when Linc 's finished , I want a turn , " Mel said , plowing his fist into his open palm . <p> Mary Jo rolled her eyes . She 'd defended David to her brothers countless times . She 'd defended him to Casey and Chloe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby 's father . Casey worked with her at the insurance company in Seattle , so she 'd met David , since he 'd come to their office for meetings every few weeks , representing corporate headquarters in California . David had charmed just about everybody  --  with the possible exception of Casey . <p> He 'd always had such good excuses for missing the birthing classes , and she 'd believed him . It was easy to do because she so badly wanted to trust him . He claimed to love her and while the pregnancy certainly had n't been planned , he 'd seemed genuinely pleased when she 'd told him.There were a few legal and financial matters that needed to be cleared up , he 'd explained , but as soon as they were dealt with , he 'd marry her . <p> For a number of months Mary Jo had convinced her brothers that David 's intentions were honorable . Now , though , she had to resign herself to the fact that David was n't willing or able to marry her . She realized she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Granted , he was older by at least twenty years , but her infatuation had led her to dismiss the significance of that . Now Mary Jo had to doubt his sincerity . She had n't heard from him in more than two weeks and he was n't answering his cell phone , and even during their last conversation , he 'd been preoccupied and abrupt . He 'd mentioned that he 'd be in Cedar Cove for Christmas with his father and stepmother and would call her then . <p> " Do you want to marry David ? " Ned asked . He was the only brother to take her feelings into consideration . <p> " Of course she wants to marry him , " Linc answered , scowling at him . " She 's about to have his baby , is n't she ? " <p> " I believe I can answer for myself . " Mary Jo calmly turned toward her oldest brother . " Actually  --  " <p> " You 're getting married , " Linc broke in . <p> " I wo n't have you holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , expression puzzled . " I do n't own a gun . " <p> She sighed ; her brothers could be so literal sometimes . " I was speaking figuratively , " she said loftily . <p> " Oh . " Linc frowned . " Well , I 'm not talking figures , I 'm talking facts . " He raised one finger . " You 're having a baby . " He raised a second . " The father of that baby needs to accept his responsibilities . " <p> " He will , " Mary Jo murmured , although any hope that David would take care of her and the baby had long since been dashed . <p> " Yes , he will , " Mel said firmly , " because we 're going to make sure he does . " <p> " And that includes putting a wedding band on your finger , " Linc informed her , giving her a look that said he would n't tolerate any argument . <p> The baby kicked as if in protest and Mary Jo echoed the child 's feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning she 'd been head-over-heels in love with David . He was the most exciting man she 'd ever met , and without even trying , he 'd swept her off her feet . Mary Jo had been thrilled when he paid attention to her , a lowly accounting clerk . Compared to the boyfriends she 'd had  --  as naive and inexperienced as she 'd been herself  --  David was a romantic hero . An older man , confident , witty , indulgent . <p> " Mary Josephine , " Mel said loudly . " Are you listening ? " <p> Blinking to clear her thoughts , Mary Jo focused on her middle brother . " I guess not , sorry . " <p> " Sorry ? " Mel stormed . " We 're talking about your future here and the future of your son . " <p> Despite the seriousness of the situation , Mary Jo yawned . She could n't help it . She covered her mouth with one hand and placed the other on her protruding belly . " I 'm going to bed , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouted after her as if she were a marine recruit and he was her drill instructor . " We need to decide what to do here and now . " <p> " Ca n't we talk about it in the morning ? " She was too exhausted to continue this argument with her brothers at  --  she glanced toward the antique clock  --  almost midnight . <p> " No . " <p> " Linc , be reasonable . " <p> " We have to get this settled . " Mel joined forces with his older brother . <p> Again Ned did n't speak . He cast her a look of quiet sympathy but he was n't taking sides . Mary Jo could see that he felt Linc and Mel were right  --  not about becoming Mrs. Rhodes but about the need for her to make some kind of decision . <br> Continues ...
