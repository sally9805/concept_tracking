Headnote You can eat better , find energy , lose the weight you want , Our expert strategies will help you avoid the biggest roadblocks and reach your goals // We know all about New Year 's resolutions . They 're shiny with possibility before midnight-but come the cold light of day , they 've stopped giving you that giddy feeling . Maybe you hang on to them for another week or two , but eventually they get lost in the momentum of your life . Again . We understand . But we also know that you can make those important changes stick . A classic study on resolutions found that 60% of people who set a New Year 's goal give up on it within 3 months . But that means 40% succeed . The difference between the ones who reach their goals and those who fall short ? Successful changers seek out or stumble onto the right strategies . Losing weight , for instance , is tough , but researchers have learned that regular weigh-ins increase the chances of success by more than 80% . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couch , having a plan B ( like using an exercise DVD when rain dampens your enthusiasm for a brisk walk ) makes you 20% more likely to become a habitual exerciser . We surveyed top researchers in psychology , weight loss , exercise , and more to identify the most common resolutions , along with the roadblocks that most often get in the way . Then we gave our experts a challenge : How can you jump over , sneak under , or crash right through the barriers ? To get on the fast track to your goals , read on . YOUR GOAL EAT Healthier THE ROADBLOCKS " Lunch is n't enough to get me through my whole workday , so I grab something unhealthy . " Stock up on snacks . When people are trying to eat right , they often toss out their snacks ; the very word conjures up Dipsy Doodles and Ho-Hos . Then , when they get hungry , they hit the office vending machine . Instead , make the right munchies your first line of defense , says Walter Willett , MD , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Public Health and author of Eat , Drink &; Weigh Less . Dry-roasted nuts are chock-full of monounsaturated ( good ) fats and protein-and they 're satisfyingly crunchy and rich . To avoid a munching marathon , pour a small bag of nuts onto a plate and eat one morsel at a time . " When I 'm hungry , fruits and vegetables are n't what I want . " Get your veggies in a creamy , crunchy form . Here 's another way strategic snacking pays off : Keep a container of hummus in the fridge and dip in ( with whole wheat crackers or pita ) when you need something that feels sinful , recommends Suzanne Havala Hobbs , DrPH , a clinical assistant professor at the University of North Carolina School of Public Health . Haifa cup qualifies as a veggie serving . Another proven way to boost your intake : Keep a bowl of fruit on your desk or kitchen counter . You may not feel like having fruit in the abstract , but if it looks good and smells great , you might find yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Satisfy it-but steer clear of the supersweetener . Processed foods frequently contain large amounts of high fructose corn syrup . The sweetener is metabolized differently from other forms of sugar , and some studies suggest that its effect on your insulin levels actually prompts you to eat again sooner . ( Another processed-food ingredient , trans fat , also may pack on extra pounds per calorie . ) Besides , says Hobbs , " High fructose corn syrup tastes sweeter than other forms of sugar , which may condition us to want ever-sweeter foods . " YOUR GOAL Make EXERCiSE a Habit THE ROADBLOCKS " I do n't have time . " Start with miniworkouts and add on from there . In a 2005 study funded by the National Institutes of Health , short-but-frequent workouts ( 10-minute sessions , four times a day ) produced the same health benefits as a daily 40-minute session . So forget holding out for a trip to the gym ; you can lower your blood pressure and cholesterol , cut your risk of diabetes , and control your weight if you just take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ K. Dishman , PhD , an exercise psychologist at the University of Georgia . " Something always comes up . " Create a backup plan . Having a fallback makes you 20% more likely to fit exercise into your day , according to Dishman . So make sure you have a few exercise DVDs at home for days when you ca n't manage anything more ambitious ; keep resistance bands at the office . Mixing up your workout style can also help . In one study , 66% of people who exercised on their own ( running , cycling ) and in structured classes ( tai chi , Pilates ) continued to work out for at least 6 months , compared with 39% of those who depended solely on classes and 60% of those exercising on their own . " I hate getting sweaty . " So do n't ! Excessive panting and sweating in a beginner means you're-hello ! - working too hard , says John Bingham , a former couch potato turned marathon runner and author of The Courage to Start . Instead , pick an intensity officially known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll be breathing heavily but still able to carry on a conversation . ( Heart rate to aim for : 120 to 150 beats per minute . ) You 'll get nearly as much cardiovascular payoff as if you went all-out , Dishman says . It 's not fun . " Match your exercise to your personality . A 2004 study at the University of Florida found that paying attention to the fit between activity and temperament boosts the likelihood that you 'll enjoy your workout . If you 're extroverted ( social , chatty ) , the research showed you 're apt to be happiest with high-intensity exercise , preferably done to music ( try an aerobics class ) . If you 're high-strung ( hyperaware of your surroundings , with a tendency to be anxious ) , indoor solo activity may be more your speed ( hop on the treadmill ) . If you 're generally open to new experiences , check out a martial arts or dance class , in which you frequently have to learn new moves and routines . If you 're a driven , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine , such as a jump rope class or cardio-capoeira . " I get discouraged because I never see results . " Lift weights . If you 're doing cardio workouts , it can take as long as 4 months before you begin to notice shapely muscle where a mound of fat used to be , says Kara Gallagher , PhD , CEO of Mohr Results , a nutrition and fitness company based in Louisville . But lifting weights can cut that time in half . To maximize the visible payoff , work out at high intensity most days of the week , and do n't spot-train ; instead , engage the whole body . Moves such as squats and walking lunges are effective , Gallagher says , especially if you hold 8- to 10-pound hand weights while doing them . YOUR GOAL CHANGE my Life ! THE ROADBLOCKS " I 'm afraid I 'll fail . " Imagine how you 'd help a friend take the leap . If you dream of switching careers or taking a trip around the world , it may do no good to try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says Judith Sills , PhD , author of The Comfort Trap . " Do n't even try to take on your resistance . Instead , think of ways to sneak around it . " For instance , ask yourself how someone else ( heaven forbid , not you ! ) might figure out how to open a small business or write a novel . " Visualizing another person doing it makes it easier to grasp that change is possible , " says Sills . " I know I 'm unhappy , but I do n't know what would make me more satisfied . " Live more adventurously right now . No need to sign up for skydiving : Ask for bigger challenges at work . Or talk to strangers at Starbucks . " Sticking your neck out in small ways mobilizes you for greater action , " says Judith Wright , author of The Soft Addiction Solution . " It 's too late to start over . " Embrace discomfort-at least temporarily . Change is hard , but perpetual dissatisfaction is no picnic either . " You wo n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncomfortable , " says Robert Leahy , PhD , a clinical professor of psychology at Weill Medical College of Cornell University and author of The Worry Cure . " Taking one step backward from your easy life is the first step forward . " You may even learn that what you thought would be excruciating ( putting your house up for sale , having a one-on-one with your boss or partner ) is n't nearly as unpleasant as you thought . YOUR GOAL Lose Weight ROAD ROADBLOCKS " I just do n't have enough willpower . " Forget willpower-it does n't work anyway . Years of research on behavior change provide strong evidence that dieters who demand perfection of themselves are likely to respond to slip-ups by pigging out . In studies on smokers trying to quit , Alan Marlatt , PhD , director of the Addictive Behaviors Research Center at the University of Washington , found that people who could avoid turning a stolen puff into a full-blown relapse were three times as likely to maintain their healthier habits at the 2-year mark . A similar dynamic is likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip and fall into a plate of your favorite pie at the local cafe , do n't label yourself a loser . Instead , realize that missteps are an inevitable part of the journey that will bring you to your goal . " I eat when I 'm depressed . Or bored . Or anxious . " Ask how instead of why . " Focusing on why you engage in emotional eating implies that there 's a deep psychological problem , " says Gary Foster , PhD , director of the Center for Obesity Research and Education at the cycle , look at what you 're usually doing when your emotional munchies hit-and change the pattern . If crankiness makes you chow down on chips while sorting through the mail after work , do n't sort through the mail right after work . Throw a leash on the dog and go for a walk instead . Or eat whole grain crackers and an apple before you leave the office , so you 're not PO 'd and ravenous when you get home . " I hate feeling deprived . " Indulge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A few months ago , I made a resolution not to have a candy bar unless I ate a piece of fruit first , " says food behavior researcher Brian Wansink , PhD , author of Mindless Eating ( for more on his research , see p. 160 ) . " When I wanted candy , I usually could n't find a piece of fruit . Or I found one and the sweetness of the fruit satisfied my craving . " Another antideprivation strategy : Set three small goals each month-none of them eliminating a food entirely . Instead of vowing you wo n't eat doughnuts , commit to skipping doughnuts for breakfast . You 'll only have to stick to any goal for 30 days-okay , maybe 31-but , says Wansink , the changes tend to last . " I get discouraged so easily . " Use the power of self-prophecy . This may sound absurdly simple , but answering yes to a yes-or-no question about whether you 're going to make a change greatly increases your odds of success , according to a study last year by Eric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Washington State University . They found that self-prediction increased participants ' attendance at a health club , boosted their consumption of healthy snacks , and strengthened their commitment to a healthier lifestyle by nearly 20% . The researchers speculate that it may help if it 's a loved one asking for the prediction . " I can lose the weight but it always creeps back . " Weigh yourself daily . In an 18-month study of 314 volunteers who 'd shed 20% of their body weight , researcher Rena Wing , PhD , and colleagues at the Weight Control and Diabetes Research Center at the Miriam Hospital in Providence , RI , found that daily maintenance is key . Participants who got on the scales every day were 82% more likely than others to keep the weight off . " Once I start eating , it 's hard to stop . " Limit the processed foods on your plate . Variety is the spice of life-and the bane of dieters . In a study at the University of Buffalo , volunteers given a four-course meal ate 44% more than those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unfortunately , processed foods frequently combine different flavors-salty and sugary , sweet and spicy-says David Katz , MD , director of the Prevention Research Center at Yale University 's School of Medicine and author of The Flavor Point Diet . " Some breakfast cereals contain more salt per serving than potato chips , " he says . YOUR GOAL Sizzle UP MY Sex LiFE THE ROADBLOCKS " I 'm never in the mood anymore . " Lower your standards . So you 're not exploding with desire ? Studies show that many women who report a lack of interest in sex respond just fine once they 're in the midst . " Women assume that mental desire must precede physical arousal , and that if the desire is n't there , well , they must not like sex , " says marital therapist Michele Weiner-Davis , author of The Sex Starved Marriage . " But for many women , that 's not true . " I frequently tell women , The next time your husband approaches you , you should just do it , ' ' " Weiner-Davis adds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common libido dampener for women who are years into a relationship : comparing their desire with the drive they felt in the early days of the union . " Do n't wait for fireworks , " Weiner-Davis says . " Work with the embers . You have to find out what you need to feel sexier . Go out and buy new underwear-not for him , but for you . " " I 'm too tired . " Do n't make sex a cost-benefit analysis . " Asking yourself , Do I get 7 hours of sleep tonight or do I have sex ? does not lead to passion , " says psychologist Kathryn Hall , PhD , author of Reclaiming Your Sexual Self : How You Can Bring Desire Back into Your Life . " Sex ends up being quick and efficient , and women 's orgasms-more than men's-become compromised . " Every now and then , Hall says , forget the laundry and other tasks , go to bed half an hour earlier , and make sex the priority . " I 'm too stressed-out . " Schedule " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bedroom . Take a few minutes at the end of the day to decompress individually , says Weiner-Davis : Read a magazine , play with the cat . Then get together to vent about your day . Just limit the shared kvetching time to less than 30 minutes-allowing it to drag on indefinitely can make the relationship feel negative . YOUR GOAL get Energized ! THE ROADBLOCKS " I 'm exhausted , but I can never get to sleep at a decent hour . " Make a few crucial changes . Researchers already know how the vast majority of people with sleep problems can start to snooze better : Use the bed only for sleep and sex-and remove all work materials , computers , and televisions from the bedroom . Keep things cool and dark ( even something as inconsequential as the light from your alarm clock may make you feel more awake , so face it away from you ) . Make sure to stick to a regular bedtime and wake time , even on weekends , to prime your body to fall asleep when you get into bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) " I get enough sleep , but I 'm still exhausted . " Check your thyroid-or your iron level . A sluggish thyroid is a common energy sapper among women over age 50 , says Lynne Kirk , MD , president of the American College of Physicians . More than 5% of all 50-plus females have signs of a failing thyroid , Kirk says , but the problem is frequently overlooked by doctors . " Have a blood test to screen for hypothyroidism every 5 to 10 years after the age of 50 , " she recommends . If you 're premenopausal , get checked for anemia-a common cause of fatigue in younger women . " I 'm wiped out by stress . " Create relaxation cues . Stress is physically exhausting , says William Boggs , MD , medical director at the Center of Integrative Medicine at the University of Maryland . So turn a frequent activity into a trigger for a relaxation exercise : Every time you grab a glass of water , for instance , stop for a few minutes of deep breathing . " This brings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and makes you able to handle the next stressful situation that comes along . " YOUR GOAL Find time for myself THE ROADBLOCKS " There simply is no more time in the day . " Take advantage of waiting around . When running errands , always come prepared for downtime , says time-management consultant Julie Morgenstern , author of Time Management from the Inside Out . " Always bring extra activities-bills , a stack of thank-you notes-so you can stay productive , " she advises . Other time-savers : Ask for the first appointment of the day , when your doctor ( or hairstylist ) is unlikely to be running behind . Avoid filling prescriptions at the beginning of the month ; that 's when lines are longest . And on your voicemail , ask callers to repeat phone numbers so you do n't have to listen to messages twice . " My free time comes in dribs and drabs , so I ca n't plan anything interesting . " Instead of window-shopping , put your money down . If you 're ambivalent about taking time for yourself , you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time you spend window-shopping or flipping through a tabloid feels wasted , sign up for a class or scheduled activity instead . " A structured escape will fuel your soul and give you energy for other areas of your life , " Morgenstern says . Besides , putting it on your calendar raises the odds you 'll follow through . " I feel guilty when I take time for myself . " Shift your focus . You may be making yourself feel worse by imagining that you ought to be able to do it all-and have time for yourself , says Susan Piver , author of The Hard Questions book series . " True contentment comes from a life fully lived , " Piver says . " Take a deep breath and remember why you 're doing what you 're doing . Thinking about that is energizing . " 5 Meet-Your-Goal Moves What you do before you start to change a habit is crucial , researchers say-and so are a couple of key moves in the midst of your efforts . Here are the most critical steps you can take toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's essential to think ahead about what you 'll do and when , says John C. Norcross , PhD , a psychologist at the University of Scranton . Get specific : That forces you to prepare for inevitable barriers and temptations , he says . " Launching a New Year 's resolution with no planning is like jumping out of an airplane and then trying to sew your parachute on the way down . " 2 . Believe that you will succeed . Self-efficacy , psychologists ' term for the belief that you can do it , gives you an essential boost , says Norcross , because it helps you keep trying in the face of obstacles . How do you develop that belief ? By mastering small challenges first ( opting for the salad over the bread sticks , for example ) , and then moving on to bigger ones ( committing to attend a group like Weight Watchers ) . 3 . Get your friends and family on board . Studies show that getting people involved in your behavior change-whether it 's a trainer or a friend who joins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep you focused and your motivation high . 4 . Reward yourself . Create small , achievable targets on the way to your big goal , and celebrate every success . If you go a week without a late-night snacking session , buy yourself flowers or a new book . Rewards condition you to expect a good outcome , says addiction researcher Alan Marlatt , PhD , of the University of Washington-and that optimism will help you keep going when things get tough . 5 . Never stop trying . Making a change is a long process , with inevitable slipups along the way . Think of even failed attempts as steps toward eventual success , says Marlatt , who points to studies on people trying to quit smoking : Though just 40% succeeded on the first try , another 20% reached their goal after more than six attempts . No matter what your resolution , persistence pays off . Author Affiliation Jessie Knadler is a Virginia-based freelance writer specializing in health and fitness . // <p>               @ @ @ @ @ @
