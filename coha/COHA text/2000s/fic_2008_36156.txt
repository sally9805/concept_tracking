If the gray clouds in the sky had not suddenly split apart and released an explosion of rain , Jewel Fairchild would have chosen to walk back to the train station on the shady road between two walls of green shrubs and trees . It was really amazing that such peace and quiet could exist not many miles from the crowded streets where she lived and worked . But had this entire day not been amazing ? <br> Cassandra Wright , the owner and CEO of Wright Glassworks , had been riding her horse and , having come too close to a fence post , had hurt her leg . She would have to stay at home for a few days  --  an unheard-of occurrence at the Glassworks , where her dawn-to-dusk work ethic was legendary . Her efficient secretary had spent most of the day on the phone , as Mrs. Wright was directing the business from her home . ( Even though Cassandra had been married twice , she insisted on being called Mrs. Wright because Wright was the name of her ancestors and her business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her taste . ) When it was discovered late in the afternoon that an important paper required the CEO 's signature , Jewel , who was a receptionist at the Glassworks , had been summoned by her supervisor and told to hand-deliver the document to Mrs. Wright 's home . Although to call the place a " home " was to understate so totally the grandeur , the dreamlike otherworldliness of it , it was almost funny . <br> Of course Jewel had known that Mrs. Wright and her family would n't live in a hut , but she 'd never seen anything like what she 'd seen today . Now , as she leaned her head back on the seat of the car in which the Wright family gardener was driving her back to town , she went back over every moment of the last few hours , trying to fix them in her memory forever . <br> First there had been the train trip out of Wrightstown , the busy city that was named for the glassworks that gave it its reason for being . Cassandra Wright did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She lived out in the country where the air was pure and the nights were quiet . There was a special spur off the main train track with a station at the end that serviced the area . Jewel had walked from the train station  --  it had n't started raining yet  --  and after about fifteen minutes , she 'd approached a big white house gleaming in the gray gloom of the day . <br> Inside the house everything gleamed too . A woman who identified herself as the housekeeper had answered the door and led Jewel into the foyer , where she had a quick impression of glossy furniture , silk , crystal , and photographs in silver frames . Light sparkled from a chandelier above her ; on a wall opposite a sweeping staircase there was a huge painting by some artist with a French name . The housekeeper had said the name , but Jewel had been too busy taking in all the splendor to register it . <br> The housekeeper led her through a series of hallways and rooms  --  more rooms than anybody would think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clock chimed like music . A rare treasure this clock was , according to the housekeeper . But by then Jewel was beginning to realize that the word " treasure " described everything in this place . <br> At first she was too overwhelmed to do more than stare . But slowly , a need started to grow inside her to touch what she was seeing . As the housekeeper hurried her along , she dug a foot into the carpet to feel the depth of the silky nap ; she allowed a finger to trace the back of a richly brocaded chair . If she could have , Jewel would have inhaled all of it ; she would have done anything , anything to take all this gleaming beauty inside herself , to own it , just for one second . <br> * * * <br> There was only one object in the place that did not seem to gleam . Actually , she was n't an object , she was a young girl , and she was sitting on a sofa reading a book . She , her book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was where the housekeeper had brought Jewel . <br> " You can wait in here and I 'll get Mrs. Wright . . . , " she 'd started to say to Jewel , but the girl had looked up and the housekeeper had realized that they were not alone . " Oh , I 'm sorry to disturb you , Miss Gwen , I did n't see you there , " she said . The girl did n't seem surprised that she 'd been overlooked . " This is a person from the glassworks come to give your mother a paper to sign , " the housekeeper went on . " I 'll put her in the sitting room . " <br> " It 's all right , " the girl said . " Let her stay . " Her voice was light and soft and there was a trace of something in it that Jewel wanted to say was snooty . She looked at the girl ; this was Gwendolyn Wright , Cassandra Wright 's daughter  --  her adopted daughter . In Wrightstown , the fact that Queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrity , or at the very least , an object of curiosity . <br> It only took Jewel a second to pass judgment on her . " Miss Gwen , " she decided , was dull . Her face was n't exactly homely , but it was just like the faces that you see on the street when you walk around a city or go to a mall , and would not recognize if you were to see them again . Her hair was red , but not a vibrant shade , it was rather washed-out . Her eyes were a nondescript brown . The only bright things about her were the gold bracelet glinting on one arm and the gold wristwatch on the other . She looked up at Jewel and nodded . " I 'm sure Mother will be along any minute , " she said . She hesitated as if she was going to say something more , then changed her mind . Two pink spots flared in her cheeks and she looked down at her hands which were folded in her lap . And there her gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being merely uncomfortable to downright insulting . <br> She did n't even offer me a glass of water ! Jewel thought indignantly . I may not have been raised in a big house with clocks that are treasures and pictures that were painted by people whose names you ca n't pronounce , but even I know that 's no way to treat a visitor in your home . Where are her manners ? <br> As if she 'd heard the unspoken rebuke the girl finally looked up . " Please sit down , " she said . She smiled awkwardly . <br> She 's shy , Jewel thought . So shy she 's tongue-tied . The realization was a surprise . The girl was wearing hundreds , maybe even thousands , of dollars ' worth of jewelry , and she lived in a palace ! How could you be shy with all of that ? But the two pink spots had now turned crimson and were spreading across Gwen Wright 's plain face . <br> I guess it 's up to me to help us out . Jewel smiled her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perfect teeth and she knew how to use them . A picture of the face she saw each day in the mirror flashed through her mind . Unlike Gwen Wright 's drab tresses , her own hair was a shimmering mass of ebony waves . Her wide blue eyes  --  really they were closer to violet  --  were fringed with thick lashes , her complexion was porcelain white , her nose was as beautiful as her mouth , and as for her figure . . . well , let 's just say she 'd never had any trouble attracting boys . Her beauty was her talisman , which was why it always came to mind when she needed extra confidence . Not that she needed any at all to talk to this dull , tongue-tied girl who was glancing longingly at the book good manners had forced her to put aside . <br> " What are you reading ? " Jewel asked , to break the ice . <br> " Le Petit Prince by Saint-ExupTry . " She pronounced it with the same nasal accent the housekeeper had used when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture in the foyer . <br> " That 's French , is n't it ? " Gwen nodded . " Do you speak it ? " Another nod . Jewel was starting to get annoyed . She was willing to do her best to keep a conversation going , but a little help from Miss Gwen would have been nice . After all , she was the one who had had all the advantages  --  she even spoke French , for heaven 's sake ! But it was as if it was Jewel 's job to smooth things over for her , and it was Gwen 's right to be taken care of . Jewel was willing to bet she got away with this kind of thing all the time . <br> Then miracle of miracles , the mute one spoke . " I 'm going to Paris , you see , so I need to bone up on my French . Hence ExupTry . " <br> Her lack of enthusiasm made Jewel even more annoyed . I 've never been anywhere , not even to Boston or New York ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <br> " I know I should be excited . " Gwen seemed to read her mind again . " But the thing is , I 'm going with Mother . " <br> And that did explain some of Gwen 's attitude . Jewel had a brief but vivid vision of the formidable Mrs. Wright , whose every instruction at the glassworks was carried out with every t crossed and every i dotted . The instructions were always graciously given , but they were obeyed in record time because no one could imagine what might happen if they were n't . Mrs. Wright was a stickler for order at home too , as everyone in town knew from her servants ' gossip . Jewel tried to imagine what it would be like to take a trip with a woman who insisted that her mail must be sorted in a tray by the time she walked in the door from work , whose Christmas presents were wrapped and ready to be delivered by December first . Her decorations consisted of one wreath that was hung on her front door and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as she had famously decreed , more would be vulgar . No , Cassandra Wright would not be an easy traveling companion . On the other hand , she was taking her daughter on the trip of a lifetime ! So what if she was a stickler for order and punctuality . Jewel would have put up with a lot more than that for a chance to see Paris ! <br> " I 'm sure you 'll have a wonderful time , " Jewel said politely . " Paris should be very . . . interesting . " <br> " Oh , yes , " Gwen said . " The trip will definitely be interesting . " And for the first time Jewel thought she saw a spark of humor in the nondescript brown eyes . It vanished the next moment when Mrs. Wright entered the room . <br> Continues ...
