TAKE a closer look at the jovial couple who routinely date , dine and dance together . Do they look younger ? Healthier ? Happier ? No , it 's not your imagination : The close-knit couple is probably healthier because they are more loving than some of their less-affectionate counterparts . In fact , there is a great deal of evidence to show that good health and the elusive fountain of youth may lie in a loving supportive relationship-and that the mere acts of touching , kissing , and just being good to each other is beneficial to your mind body and soul . This is the message of an increasing number physicians , alternativ ealth e providers , and researchers . But , as Tina Turner asks , what 's love got to do with it ? Love may have everything to do with it , according to experts . Recent studies say happily married men live 8-10 years longer than single or divorced men , and happily married women live 3-4 years longer than single or divorced women . On the other hand , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition deteriorating . Behavior specialists point out that bad relationships can put a strain on your heart , and at the same time , initiate a domino effect of negative stress-induced behaviors , such as abusing controlled substances or overeating in an effort to fend off the feelings of loneliness , rejection or depression . In one study , University of Pittsburgh researchers have found that love has the power to protect women from indulging in such health risks . The researchers discovered that a happy relationship can curb strokes and heart attacks in women after menopause , when they are most at risk for the ailments . The doctors , after studying 490 women from pre-menopausal years in their 40s to at least five years after menopause , found that before menopause , the unhappily married and single women were significantly worse off on heart disease risk factors ( e.g. , high blood pressure and cholesterol level ) when compared to happily married women . It was reasoned that single women and women involved in dissatisfying relationships suffered " stress-induced rises in blood pressure " that the stressful relationship led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end the happily married women had the best cardiovascular health of all groups . Photograph Loving , supportive relationships can make you look younger , feel better and improve your overall well-being , according to experts . Posed by professional models . // Much like their happy spouses , happily married men are reaping the health-associated benefits of a loving relationship as well , and researchers at the RAND Center for the Study of Aging believe they know why . They found that the health benefits for men involved in happy marriages stem from exposure to improved nutrition , a home atmospherer that reduces stress and stress-related illnessed , and a mate who encourages healthy behaviors and discourages unhealthy behaviors . It stands to reason that if love can improve your health , lack of love can litterally destroy you . Psychologists at the University of Utah found this to be especially true for men who routinely argue with their wives . The psychologists evaluated several combative married couples who each engaged in a heated debate designed to measure how hostile they were . Researchers found that during the debates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hostile men , not in their wives . Yet , in another highprofile study , hostile , stressed-out women suffered the most damning heart-related health risks . Kristina Orth-Gomer reports in the Journal of the American Medical Association that women with heart disease tripled their risk of recurrent heart trouble if they were involved in a stressful relationship . " Among women who were married or cohabiting with a male partner , marital stress was associated with a 2.9-fold increased risk of recurrent events after adjustment for age , estrogen status , education level and smoking , " she notes . Orth-Gomer also concludes that women living alone without a partner fared much better than those involved in a toxic relationship . Relationship therapists say you should leave a person who aggravates you or makes you sick  --  although many point out that living in isolation for the rest of your days can also have a negative effect on your health . San Diego physician and sex therapist Theresa Crenshaw , author of The Alchemy of Love and Lust , says people who choose to live in isolation may risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved ones . Dr. Crenshaw is one of many health specialists who swear by the healing power of the human touch . She explains that displays of affection such as hugging or kissing ( in the context of a meaningful relationship ) can help heal the sick and soothe the worried . Furthermore , the act of touching , according to experts , not only increases the body 's natural chemical oxytocin ( which affects the emotional centers of the brain , and can trigger warmer feelings of affection ) but it also boosts the immune system and tames blood pressure levels . For committed couples , touching provides a host of health benefits as well , such as relieving stress , connecting intimately with your loved one , and producing endorphins , the body 's natural pain reliever . Several prominent sex therapists have also found that regular sexual activity is comparable to regular exercise , and produces similar benefits , such as improving cholesterol levels and increased circulation . Some reports indicate that men who have safe sex at least three times a week may even have a decreased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead to depression and feelings of isolation and loneliness . // Taking the health benefits of loving a bit further , David Weeks , an American neuropsychologist at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital , ( located in Scotland ) who studied 3,500 people ( age 30-100 ) for a decade , said lovemaking on a regular basis makes you look younger . " It 's not a case of these people having more sex because they look younger ; they actually look younger because they are having more sex in loving , stable , relationships . The key ingredients for looking younger are staying active .. and maintaining a good sex life , " he reports . Yet a number of studies indicate that many AfricanAmericans , married or single , do not enjoy sex for various reasons . Some do n't take their relationship to the next level due to physical ailments or emotional barriers . For others , sex is boring , anti-climatic , predictable , or , in some cases , nonexistent in their lives . On the other hand , many on-the-go couples find themselves just too busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author of Stolen Women : Reclaiming Our Sexuality ... Taking Back Our Lives , warns that couples who avoid sex altogether ( rather than confront their issues ) can suffer adverse health effects . " Sex is a very critical part of our well-being , it 's a part of our body and our nature , " explains Dr. Wyatt . " Yet so many people choose to isolate it , as if it does n't matter in relationships . And there are consequences of that , such as becoming irritated , frustrated , or sending a message of rejection to your partner . " There are consequences for engaging in a promiscuous lifestyle as well . Most recent studies point out that intimacy is a key element in receiving the health benefits of lovemaking , and promiscuity may produce an opposite effect by introducing a sense of anxiety and fear into the various relationships-not to mention increasing the risk factors for contracting deadly or incurable diseases . Fred Ernst , a professor of psychiatry , neurology and behavioral science at Meharry Medical College , says that a good relationship is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's difficult to separate the chicken from the egg-a good sex life does n't exist in a vacuum , " he says . " A good sex life stems from a good relationship . " A good relationship yields good health , and good health yields good loving , and specialists say there is a recommended formula that can put you on track to receive the health and emotional benefits of love . First , you should get a complete physical exam with a doctor , and start an exercise regimen today , not tomorrow . The American Heart Association suggests that adults exercise for 30 minutes at least 3 times a week , which can reduce the risk factors for cardiovascular disease , a leading killer in the Black community . The second step is to give your body the right fuel to boost your energy . Nutritionists suggest that you choose the correct foods according to the guidelines of the Food Pyramid ( see page 72 ) to assure that you receive the recommended daily allowances . Last but not least , check the status of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or cause your blood pressure to rise ? If so , perhaps this union is causing you more harm than good . Dr. Wyatt suggests that you seek professional help in emotional or relationship issues are possibly draining your health . " There 's almost nobody who had n't experienced relationship problems at some point in life  --  that 's not abnormal , " she says . " What 's abnormal is if you keep it a secret or blame your partner , which will make you grow distant from each other . Instead , be honest with yourself . Understand that there may be issues that you ca n't handle by yourself and seek professional help . " She adds that if the relationship is a no-go , re-evaluate your options . Remember , you can do baseball by yourself . Experts say love , health and happiness can become a part of your reality once you decide to invest some quality time into yourself , your relationship and your total well-being .
