Lieut . General Russel Honor has long legs , and he uses them to full effect . A lean 6 ft. 2 in. , Honor strides across the deck of the U.S. warship Iwo Jima as aides rush to keep up . He strides into a room full of admirals and generals and barks out orders . ( " I want you to go and get it done , " he says , telling them he has no time for progress reports . ) He strides down the streets of New Orleans to correct his soldiers ' comportment ; he strides down tarmacs to waiting helicopters . He strides away from the Governor of Louisiana as she honors him at a press conference . " Where 's my general ? " asks a nonplussed Kathleen Blanco . Across the yard , Honor , a Dutch Masters cigar curled under his forefinger , has a cell phone pressed to his ear . " He 's taking care of business , " an aide says . <P> With civilian authority in the Gulf Coast tangled in controversy , politics and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuing its mission efficiently is the U.S. military relief effort led by Honor . Since he arrived in the region on Aug. 31 , he has been packing two days into one , shuttling by helicopter along the storm- and flood-ravaged coast . When he sees a problem , he tackles it . He immediately pressured the Federal Government to move gasoline into damaged areas , for example , arguing that if people have gas , they can drive to designated pickup points for food and water so that airlifts can then be focused on those in direst need . Under his direction , the military has delivered 13.6 million meals , handed out 24.2 million liters of water , launched 24 ships and deployed more search-and-rescue helicopters than are now flying in Afghanistan and Iraq combined . " Normally , " he says , referring to the military , " we go in and break things . Here we 're trying to fix things . " <P> Honor seems uniquely qualified for the task . Until June 2004 , he was the Standing Joint Force Headquarters  --  Homeland Security commander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **27;18736;TOOLONG attack as well as for the onslaught of storms like Katrina . The office had conducted a study of what New Orleans should do after a direct hit by a massive hurricane . It concluded , says Honor , that " there would be a lot of water " but never took into account levees bursting . A plan was in place to evacuate the city , he says as he surveys the detritus in New Orleans ' Convention Center , but " do n't confuse a plan with execution . A plan is like good intentions . You do n't win with good intentions . " <P> Honor also says help should have come sooner . First responders hesitated , he says , because they were " afraid of big crowds of poor people . " It was a case of " people believing the movie . " But the city was not out of control , he concluded after delivering food and seeing the streets for himself . The subsequent forays by government forces may have reassured outsiders desperate that help get into the deluged city , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside the city . Imagine being rescued and having a fellow American point a gun at you . These are Americans . This is not Iraq . "
