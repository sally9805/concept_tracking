HE 'S SUPER  --  THANKS FOR ASKING <P> In the face of rampant rumors and even a prime-time grilling from Barbara Walters , RICKY MARTIN has gracefully kept his sexuality a well-guarded secret . But the woman rumored to be Martin 's girlfriend is ripping off the closet doors to expose Ricky as the greatest Latin lover since Casanova cruised through the 18th century . Prefacing her remarks with " I 'm not supposed to talk about this , " Ines Misan told the New York Post that Martin " is all man , " graciously noting that " on a scale of 1 to 10 , I 'll give him a 20 . " As if that did n't clarify matters , the 20-year-old Latvian model addressed the whispers of Martin 's homosexuality more directly : " It 's like a joke . I wish every man were so gay . " Despite the kind words , Martin 's reps insist the two are " just friends .

It took about eight minutes . In an appearance on The Late Show with David Letterman , Seinfeld shared the obligatory picture of his four-month-old daughter Sascha and chatted about his annual head-clearing cross-country drives . His stand-up material consisted of diatribes against people who ask other people to say hello for them ; Jared , the formerly obese Subway-sandwich dieter ; and the folks at Pizza Hut , who insist on hiding cheese in every possible crevice of their product . It was not a radical departure from his previous work .
