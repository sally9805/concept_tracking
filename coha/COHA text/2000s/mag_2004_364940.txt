You take your family to the same quaint rental cottage on the beach for two weeks every summer . Would n't it be great to have a place to call your own ? With mortgage rates still relatively low , this is the perfect time to buy a vacation home , right ? Not necessarily . There are a few things you need to consider first . <P> One is that financing will be a little tougher for a second home than for a first home . Since many banks believe there is a greater risk of a borrower 's defaulting on a vacation home , mortgage rates can be higher than they would be on a primary residence . <P> You also need to think about the hidden costs of vacation-home ownership . How will you take care of the place when you 're not there ? Security systems and caretakers can be expensive , but leaving the home unattended for long periods of time could lead to break-ins and costly damage if , say , a water pipe bursts and no one is around to notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Better Business Bureau suggests hiring a rental agent or management company to help you take care of it for the first year . <P> There are other considerations beyond the financial . Do you really want to spend all your weekends or vacations in the same place ? Consider making trial trips to your dream spot in different seasons and talk with homeowners in the area to get a feel for what life is like in the community year round . The perfect beach in June could be unbearably touristy in August or unpleasantly isolated in January . <P> Decide how often you will actually be using the property . Studies show that most second-home owners do n't use their houses more than four weeks a year . If you really wo n't be spending much time there , it 's probably more cost effective to rent than to buy . <P> For those who want a vacation home but are reluctant to take on one more household to-do list , there 's another option : fee-based membership clubs that offer access to a range of luxury homes . Unlike traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the same dates every year , these clubs let members stay whenever they like in a number of places around the world . One , the Portofino Club , features homes in properties that range from New York City 's Trump International Tower to a palazzo in Venice . For some homeowners , access to a world of second homes may be better than owning just one .
