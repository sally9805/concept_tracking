They 're only toys : cuddly cloth cowboys , adorable insects , furry monsters . But when the pixilated storytellers at Pixar fashion them , these playthings come to life . Take Marlin , the single-dad clown fish , voiced by Albert Brooks , in the new Pixar astonishment Finding Nemo . Brooks says that when a reporter on a junket described this fish father as overprotective , " I stood up and said , ' Overprotective ? If your wife and almost all your children were eaten by a shark , you would n't be overprotective ? ' Then I realized  --  I 'm yelling about a fish . " <P> Of course , Marlin is not even a fish . He 's a computer-generated image attached to a famously fretful voice . But Marlin has all-too-human qualities : insecurity , suspiciousness , giant wrinkles of worry and a lot of saving heart . Endearing flaws like these , along with an unmatched graphic elegance and elfin wit , have made Pixar 's first four features  --  Toy Story , A Bug 's Life , Toy Story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer-generated imagination .

The Toy Story tandem and A Bug 's Life were clever parables of workplace camaraderie . And the two most recent Pixar films are stories of not-quite-mature men ( in the guise of monsters or clown fish ) who learn the onerous joys of fatherhood . Like many classic Disney cartoons , and Spielberg fables , Finding Nemo is about the traumatic separation of a child from his parent . The refreshing difference here is that Nemo dramatizes the anxiety ( and adventures ) a parent undergoes searching for his wayward , precious kid .
