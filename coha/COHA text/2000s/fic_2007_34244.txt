Chapter One As I opened the car door in the parking lot of boot camp , a sodden cloud of hot sulfur slithered in . The noise followed soon behind it . The parking lot , the wide dirt track that led into the thick squat trees , the clearing I could glimpse in front of the largest tent I 'd ever seen-they were all teeming with people . Sweaty , smiling people in khaki pants , T-shirts , and leather boots . Like mine . " Yuck , " said Tanya , wrinkling her nose . " This area of Florida 's mostly swamp , " Dad said . " That 's the smell . " Somehow , I did n't think that was all she was referring to . I was starting to wonder if this had been a very bad idea . By the time my family had all climbed back into the car after hugs and tears-Mum's-I was almost sure of it . Standing beside my new team leader , surrounded by a thousand strangers , I had never felt more alone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark , " Gary said , prompting me to pick up my backpack and follow him into the massive tent , silently resenting his cheerfulness . " Cori , Brendan and Kyle . " Gary dispensed with introductions in four whole words as we reached two guys lounging on the floor by a tent pole the size of a sequoia . He moved on to more important matters . " Where are Drew and Elissa ? " " Talking to friends , and bathroom , " Kyle answered economically , pointing right , which gave me a clear view of the snake tattoo that wound down the inside of his forearm . It did n't quite fit with the short blond hair and blue eyes , although the dusty bandanna tied around his forehead did give him a certain rakish air . " Y'all wait here until I get back with Mark . " Looking harried , Gary disappeared into the crowd . Brendan jumped to his feet and held out his hand . I think my mouth actually fell open . " Six foot five , " he preempted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Half muscle , half Oreo cookies , " Kyle corrected , without getting up . We 'd progressed all the way through where we came from-San Diego for Kyle , Colorado for Brendan-and started in on hobbies when a living Barbie doll strolled in and sat down , fanning herself gracefully with a sheet of paper . She was small ; her T-shirt was neatly tucked in ; her long blonde braid hung straight clown her back . She was even sweating elegantly . I felt grubby just looking at her . " I already know what Elissa 's favorite hobby is , " Kyle said with a wicked grin . " His name starts with C. " She blushed . " He 's more than a hobby , Kyle ! Colin 's my boyfriend , " she said to me , pulling out a picture and passing it over . " The way you talk about him , I did n't think you had time for anything else , " Kyle said . " I do ballet , " she said . That explained the perfect posture . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , sighing . " President of the student body , captain of the debate team , captain of the track team ... " I thought he was serious until he started to laugh . " Well , I will be , next year when I 'm a senior . What about you , Cori ? " " Underwater basket weaving . " Kyle was the only one who laughed . Elissa just looked politely interested . " Okay , " I capitulated . " Horseback riding . " " Riding ! " Brendan said . " We 've got horses on our ranch . There 's nothing like riding alone at sunset . God 's so huge ; it 's awesome ! " " What 's awesome ? " Another girl had arrived in an untidy tangle of arms , legs , and red hair . She crashed down , practically in my lap , and introduced herself as Drew . " Cool ! " she said when she heard my accent . " Another non-American to keep me company . I 'm Canadian . Elissa , can I borrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , what 's awesome ? " " Brendan asked Gary if we could have extra practice on the obstacle course every day because we 're a backpack team , and Gary said yes . That 's what 's awesome . We 're all real excited , " Kyle said casually , looking to the rest of us for support . Drew , both hands occupied scraping back her hair , looked appalled . " Brendan ! Are you crazy ? " Elissa stared at the ground , and I stifled a smile . Elissa buckled first . " Kyle 's just teasing , Drew . " Drew went from mad to amused in two seconds . She laughed and threw Elissa 's comb at Kyle . It bounced off him and landed in the dirt . " Oops , sorry , " she said as she retrieved it , wiped it off , and handed it back . " Hey , where are the bathrooms ? " Elissa pointed to several port-a-potties near the trees , each one pinpointed by a long line in front of the door . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's it , " Elissa said , not without sympathy . " Have mercy ! " Drew muttered as she got up and left . " I do n't think she has much idea what she 's in for , " Elissa said thoughtfully . I did my best to look as though I knew exactly what I was in for . " She 'll be fine , " Brendan said . " She seems like a good sport . " Elissa did n't look convinced . Five hours later I 'd stopped wondering whether Drew was going to prove to be a good sport and started wondering whether I was . After Mark had finally arrived , Gary had us on our feet before we 'd even finished introductions , although it turned out we had plenty of time for those as we stood in line after line collecting everything from drama costumes , mime makeup , and a portable puppet theatre to canteens and waterproof waist packs . Mark turned out to be a small , wiry , pugnacious kid from New York . He looked thirteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsubtle query . " We 're going to spend the summer babysitting , " I heard Kyle complain to Brendan as we stowed all our new possessions and hurried to line up at the start of the obstacle course . " See you at the wall ! " Gary yelled , as someone entirely too close to my ear blew a very loud whistle . " Which way ? What wall ? " Drew looked as frazzled as I felt . " I was on the England team last year , " Elissa said , leading the way at a run . " Follow the arrows . Jacob 's ladder is the first obstacle . " I 'd always wondered what Jacob 's ladder looked like . As a kid I 'd pictured a wide sweep of steps like the ones leading up to the Sydney Opera House but made out of marble , with angels hovering over them , reverent and silent . According to boot camp , however , Jacob 's ladder was a forty-foot-high rope cargo net that we had to climb up and over . After that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn that Mount Sinai was apparently made out of tires , that the main task of Egyptian slaves had been to transport bricks in a wheelbarrow and build mini-pyramids , and that the Slough of Despond was n't just a figment of John Bunyan 's imagination . It was a large moat blocking our path and filled with muddy water . It was also the last straw for Drew . " Fun , huh , Drew ? " Kyle said , pacing back and forth as Elissa explained that someone would have to jump for the two ropes dangling over the middle of the water . Drew , sitting in the dirt beside me and struggling to catch her breath , snapped . " This is not fun ! " she yelled . " Fun is going shopping . This is torture ! " Then she burst into tears . Silently , I agreed . Where were the sandy beaches ? Where was the scent of cinnamon ? Kyle was quick to apologize , and Brendan stuck out a hand to help her up . She batted it away . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said to Kyle , " you guys can get the ropes . " " No problem , " Kyle said , backing up alongside Brendan for a running start . Brendan made it , but Kyle did n't . He snagged his rope just below a large knot , and his hands slipped . He was swinging forward with the force of his jump , and when he went to wrap his legs around the rope he fell . He hit the water with a dull smacking sound and disappeared . He stood up , looking glazed in chocolate milk , to find all five of his teammates laughing . " It 's slippery , " he said defensively , grabbing the end of the rope and swinging it across to us . " You try it . " " Cori , hold it for me , " Elissa instructed . " I 'll show you how it works best . " She took a run-up , launched herself at the rope , sailed across , and jumped . Brendan caught her on the other side and narrowly saved her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he slipped on the bank and ended up wet to the waist , looking decidedly unhappy . " I hate it here , " Drew said . I nodded slowly , but the expression on my face must have been more transparent than I 'd intended , because she looked at me and suddenly , unexpectedly , giggled . " You can do it , " I said . " I 'll hold it for you . " She might have made it , except that she forgot to jump off when she reached the other side . Soon she was hanging off the knot above the middle of the pit , barely keeping her feet clear of the water . " Help ! What do I do ? " she screeched . On the other side , Mark was helpless with laughter , and the other three were calling out advice . " Swing your body to get some momentum , " Elissa shouted . Drew tried , but only succeeded in flopping back and forth , barely even twitching the rope . " I do n't want to fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that bad , " Kyle said . " Just drop off and wade out . " Brendan took a step forward . " I 'll come get you . " " Wait , " Kyle said reluctantly . " I 'm already wet ; I 'll do it . " He waded back into the pit and slogged over to Drew . " Kyle 's right there , " I called . " Sit on his shoulders . " " But my boots will go in the water , " she said , unwrapping one leg and trying to hook it over Kyle 's shoulder . " Choose . " He grunted as he helped her swing the other leg over . " Your boots or you . " I could see what was coming . She was sitting on his shoulders with her arms wrapped around his head , trying to keep both feet out of the water by holding her legs out straight . " Drew , put your feet down ! " I yelled . Kyle took one step and staggered . She clutched at his head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He swatted at her hands , took one more step , and fell over sideways . It was like watching a tree fall in slow motion . Drew was screaming as she hit the water . On the other side of the pond , Mark folded gently to the dirt in a heaving , wheezing pile . Drew only had one word to say when she came up . Whistle man looked appalled . So did Elissa . " Young lady , " whistle man called , making a notation on his clipboard . " No swearing , please . " " You dropped me ! " she accused Kyle , pushing long ropes of hair away from her face . " I could n't help it ! " he said . " You had your hands over my eyes ! " " I swallowed some of that filthy water , " Drew said as Brendan helped her up the bank . " I 'll probably get malaria . " " Guys , " I called , indicating the ropes , now hanging serenely over the middle of the muddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water for the third time . " I 'll come and get you , " he said , sounding as though he were offering to swim the English Channel on my behalf . " I can do it by myself , " I said . He retreated , his sudden grin a challenge . " Okay , then , do it . " Suddenly the ropes looked a long way away . " Cor-i . Cor-i ... " Brendan started the chant while I backed up . At least I made it to the rope when I jumped . But it was wet and slick and hard to get a firm grip . Before long I was hanging off a knot in the middle of the slough , up to my knees in water . I could feel it pouring , pleasantly cool , into my boots . " Want me to rescue you ? " Kyle cloaked his taunt in an offer . " No . " It was tempting , but I let go instead , shuddering as the water lapped at my chin and my boots settled into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said as I waded out . " We 're almost done . Jericho 's wall is just around the corner . " " I thought the wall around Jericho fell down , " I grumbled as we jogged into a large clearing and I saw the last obstacle , a ten-foot-high wooden wall we were supposed to scale . Elissa laughed . " Only after days of marching and blowing trumpets . In the meantime , Brendan and Cori , you go over first . Kyle last . " With Kyle boosting from below , and Brendan and me lifting from the elevated platform on the other side , we hauled Drew , Elissa , and Mark up fairly easily . Kyle , however , was another story . Even with a running start , he barely managed to grab one of Brendan 's hands . Brendan gave a tug , and I snagged Kyle 's other hand . My shoulder felt like it was about to be rudely separated from its socket , and the top of the wall dug painfully into my ribs . " Cori , no . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get up here , then . " He planted his feet on the wall , and with Brendan doing most of the work , we managed to heave him to the top . Then we collapsed on the platform , too wasted to think about climbing down the ladder and joining the others . The two guys high-fived each other over the top of my head . On the ground below us , Gary clicked a stopwatch . " Thirty-seven minutes and twenty-four seconds , " he said . " Not bad for your first try . By the end of boot camp you should knock more than ten minutes off that time . " Drew whimpered . " Can we change clothes now ? " she asked . " Oh , you 'll dry out soon enough , " Gary said . " We do n't hike out to our campsite until after the evening rally . Now , let 's hustle . You 're late for puppetry class . " I closed my eyes and thought of home . Within two months I would remember how miserable I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was once soft enough to get teary over an obstacle course . It was very dark that night on the track out to our campsite . A thick , moist darkness , as if the swamp were breathing around us . It was either raining , or the invisible trees looming above us were crying . Large warm drops hit my shoulders and soaked into my hair . I could n't see anything beyond the small pale circles cast by our flashlights , but I could hear the others ahead and behind me . Both groups were talking about home . " ... live with my aunt and uncle , " I heard Kyle tell Brendan in front of me . " They 're cool . Mostly . " " My folks are the best , " Brendan said . " I 'm homesick already , " Elissa said quietly . " I miss Colin . " " I miss my bed , " Drew said . Only Mark and I were silent . I was trying to decide whether or not I would eat a live worm if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our campsite . The small log circle and three tents nestled among the bushes did n't manage to appear cozy , just bedraggled . " Okay , team . Gather round , " Gary said . His wife , Diane , reached out to take his hand and mine as we made a circle . As I bowed my head for the prayer , I felt a trickle of cold water creep down my back . Despite Gary 's proclamation of collective gratitude , I did n't really feel very thankful for the day . In fact , I was dreading tomorrow . Chapter Two On day ten of boot camp I woke early , still exhausted but unable to drift off again , already anticipating the shrill whistle I knew would come at five thirty . The birds were offering their first tentative calls , and it was peaceful and cool in the darkness . I started to case on the same khaki pants and shirt I 'd discarded the night before , moving quietly so I would n't wake Drew and Elissa . My clothes felt stiff and grainy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Scott was doing . Sleeping , probably , like most of the other sane people in this world who had n't bartered away their entire summer on the strength of a whim . Well , maybe whim was a bit strong , but when I compared my " I thought it would be fun " to Kyle 's " God told me to come , " that 's what it felt like . " God really told you to come on this trip ? " I 'd asked him , wondering why I sounded so skeptical . If I did n't believe a person could hear from God , what was I doing traipsing off to Indonesia to build a church ? " Yeah , " was all he 'd said . But his tone implied , Why , did n't you get the same message ? Before boot camp I would have said that I was sure that God wanted me to do this . But ten days of blisters , aching muscles , heavy backpacks , no showers , and disgusting food had sent me scrambling hourly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my decision seemed to have been based on the following syllogism : 1 ) God wants us to do good things ; 2 ) This is a good thing to do ; 3 ) Therefore , God wants me to do this . If there had been any specific message for me about the trip , I was no longer sure I 'd sat still long enough to listen for it . It seemed I was n't the only one who had relied on that particularly versatile equation . Drew had collapsed beside me in the drama tent the day before and looked up plaintively .
