Try this for Advent : Next time you are forced to cool your heels , see the wait as a spiritual invitation . <p> Advent is the liturgical season of vigilance or , to put more mundanely , of waiting . During the four weeks prior to Christmas , we light the candles of our Advent wreaths and put ourselves in the spiritual pace of the Israelite people who , through many long centuries , waited for the coming of the Messiah ( " How long , O Lord ? " ) . <p> In the wonderful avant-garde German movie Run Lola Run a young Woman finds herself in a terrible bind : She needs to gather an enormous amount of money in a ridiculously short period of time . Throughout the movie she runs and runs , desperately trying through her own frantic efforts to make things right , but nothing works . Finally , at the moment when she finds herself at the absolute limit of her powers , she slows to a trot , looks up to heaven and says , " Ich warte , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting ) . Though she does not explicitly address God and though there has been no hint throughout the movie that Lola is the least bit religious , this is undoubtedly a prayer . And in the immediate wake of her edgy request a rather improbable solution to her problem presents itself . <p> Lola 's prayer has always reminded me of Simone Weil , that wonderful and mysterious 20th-century French mystic whose entire spirituality is predicated upon the power of waiting , or  --  in her language  --  of expectation . In prayer , Weil taught , we open our souls , expecting God to act even when the content of that expectation remains unclear . In their curious vigilance and hoping against hope , both Lola and Simone are beautiful Advent figures . Hold your horses <p> Their attitude is , of course , deeply rooted in biblical revelation . From beginning to end of scripture we discover stories of people who are compelled to wait . <p> The patriarch Abraham received the promise that he would become , despite his old age , the father of a son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the stars in the night sky . But the fulfillment of that promise was a long time in coming . Through many years , as he and his wife grew older and older , as the likelihood of their parenthood became increasingly remote , Abraham waited . Did he doubt ? Did he wonder whether he had misconstrued the divine promise ? Did he waver in his faith ? Did he endure the taunts of his enemies and the pitying glances of his friends ? Probably . But he waited , and in time the promise came true . <p> Abraham 's great-grandson Joseph , the wearer of the multicolored coat , saw in a dream that he would be a powerful man and that his brothers would one day bow down to him in homage . But the realization of that dream came only after a long and terrible wait . He was sold into slavery by those very brothers , falsely accused of sexual misconduct , humiliated , and finally sent to prison for seven years . Imagine what it must have been like to endure years in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of privacy , the terrible food in small amounts , sleeplessness , torture , and above all , hopelessness . This is what Joseph had to wait through before his dream came true in a most unexpected way . <p> The people of Israel were miraculously delivered from slavery in Egypt , led across the Red Sea by the mighty hand of Moses  --  and then they waited . A journey that normally would have taken only a few weeks stretched to 40 years as they wandered rather aimlessly through the desert . The book of Exodus frequently gives us indications of what this time of vigil was like : " The people grumbled against Moses , ' We are disgusted with this wretched food ... Why did you lead us out into this desert to die ? Were there not graves enough in Egypt ? ' " ( Exodus 16:2-3 ) They were hardly models of patience . <p> Even poor Noah had to wait , cooped up in the ark with his irritable family and restless animals while the waters slowly retreated . <p> In the course of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of waiting . Relatively late in life Ignatius of Loyola realized he was being called by God to do great things . But before he found his path he passed through a wide variety of experiences in the course of many years : a time of stark asceticism and prayer at Manresa , wandering to the Holy Land and back while living hand-to-mouth and sleeping in doorways , taking elementary courses in Paris alongside young kids , gathering a small band of followers and leading them through the Spiritual Exercises . Only at the end of this long sojourn  --  founding the Company of Jesus  --  did he realize the great thing God called him to do . <p> In Dante 's Purgatorio , the theme of waiting is on prominent display . Dante and Virgil encounter a number of souls who slouch at the foot of the mountain of Purgatory , destined to make the climb to heaven but compelled for the time being to wait . How long ? As long as God determines . God has no express lane <p> All of this , I submit , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human beings have always been in a hurry , but modern people especially seem to want what they want when they want it . We are driven , determined , goal-oriented , fast-moving . I , for one , ca n't stand waiting . <p> As a Chicagoan I find myself unavoidably in a lot of traffic jams , and nothing infuriates me more . Usually stuck behind a massive truck , you have no idea when you will get where you want to be , and there is nothing you can do about it . <p> I hate waiting at doctors ' offices ; I hate waiting in line at the bank ; I hate waiting for the lights to come back on when the electricity fails . <p> So when I 'm told that waiting seems to belong to the heart of the spiritual life , I 'm not pleased , for here , too , I want answers , direction , clarity  --  and I want them pronto . I desire to feel happy and to know what God is up to ; I need my life to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spiritual life , but I want to be in charge of it and to make it unfold according to my schedule : Run Barron Run . All of this is profoundly antipathetic to the mood and spirit of Advent . <p> So what sense can we make of the countercultural and counterintuitive spirituality of vigilance ? The first thing we have to realize is that we and God are , quite simply , on different time tables . The second letter of Peter states this truth with admirable directness : " To you , O Lord , a thousand years are like a day . " ( 2 Peter 3:8 ) <p> To the God who stands outside of space and time and who orders the whole of creation , our hours , days , years , eons have a radically different meaning . What is a long time to us is an instant for God , and hence what seems like delay to us is no delay at all to God . What seems like dumb and pointless waiting to us can be the way that God , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's purposes out . <p> Theologian Richard Rohr summed up the spiritual life in the phrase " your life is not about you , " and this insight is particularly important in terms of the present question . " Why is n't God acting how I want and when I want ? " Perhaps because your life is part of a complex whole , the fullness of which only God can properly grasp and fittingly order . <p> But we can make things even more specific . Is it possible that we are made to wait because the track we are on is not the one God wants for us ? Author G. K. Chesterton said that if you are on the wrong road , the very worst thing you can do is to move quickly . And there is that old joke about the pilot who comes on the intercom and says , " I have good news and bad news , folks : The bad news is that we 're totally lost ; the good news is that we 're making excellent time ! " Maybe we 're forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course we 've charted , to stop hurtling down a dangerous road . <p> Or perhaps we are made to wait because we are not yet adequately prepared to receive what God wants to give us . In his remarkable letter to Proba , Saint Augustine argued that the purpose of unanswered prayer is to force expansion of the heart . When we do n't get what we want , we begin to want it more and more , with ever greater insistency , until our souls are on fire with the desire for it . Sometimes it is only a sufficiently expanded and enflamed heart that can take in what God intends to give . <p> What would happen to us if we received , immediately and on our own terms , everything we wanted ? We might be satisfied in a superficial way , but we would n't begin to appreciate the preciousness of the gifts . After all , the Israelites had to wait thousands of years before they were ready to receive God 's greatest gift . <p> Even if we are on the right track and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give , we still might not be ready to integrate a particular grace into our lives or to handle the implications of it . Joseph the dreamer clearly wanted to be a great man , but if he had been given political power and authority when he was an arrogant kid , the results would have been disastrous both for himself and for those under his control . His many years of suffering  --  his terrible wait  --  made him a ruler with both wisdom and deep compassion . And so , when his brothers did indeed finally bow down to him as he foresaw in his dream , he was able to react not in vengeance , but in love : " I am Joseph , your brother . " Three Advent practices <p> What practically can we do during the season of waiting and vigil keeping ? What are some practices that might incarnate for us the spirituality described here ? <p> How about the classically Catholic discipline of eucharistic adoration ? To spend a half-hour or an hour in the presence of the Lord is not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " getting " anywhere  --  but it is a particularly rich form of spiritual waiting . <p> As you keep vigil before the Blessed Sacrament , bring to Christ some problem or dilemma that you have been fretting over , and then pray Lola 's prayer : " Ich warte , ich warte . " Say , " Lord , I 'm waiting for you to solve this , to show me the way out , the way forward . I 've been running , planning , worrying , but now I 'm going to let you work . " Then , throughout Advent , watch attentively for signs . <p> Also , when you pray before the Eucharist , allow your desire for the things of God to intensify ; allow your heart and soul to expand . Pray , " Lord , make me ready to receive the gifts you want to give , " or even , " Lord Jesus , surprise me . " <p> A second  --  and more offbeat  --  suggestion : Do a jigsaw puzzle . Find one of those big , complex puzzles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time and plenty of patience , and make of it an Advent project . As you assemble the puzzle think of each piece as some aspect of your life : a relationship , a loss , a failure , a great joy , an adventure , a place where you lived , something you should n't have said , an act of generosity . So often the events of our lives seem like the thousand pieces of a puzzle lying incoherently and disconnectedly before us . As you patiently put the puzzle together meditate on the fact that God is slowly , patiently , according to his own plan and purpose , ordering the seemingly unrelated and incongruous events of our lives into a picture of great beauty . <p> Finally , take advantage of traffic jams and annoying lines  --  really anything that makes you wait . And let the truth of what 18th-century spiritual writer Jean-Pierre de Caussade said sink in : " Whatever happens to you in the course of a day , for good or ill , is an expression of God 's will . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheel , or rolling your eyes in frustration , see the wait as a spiritual invitation . <p> When you are forced to slow down , pray one of the great , repetitive vigil prayers of the church , such as the rosary or the Jesus prayer ( " Lord Jesus Christ , Son of God , have mercy on me , a sinner " ) . With this resolution in mind , hang a rosary around your rearview mirror at the beginning of Advent . Consider the possibility that God wants you at that moment to wait and then sanctify the time through one of those savoring prayers . <p> The entire Bible ends on a note not so much of triumph and completion as longing and expectation : " Come , Lord Jesus . " From the very beginning of the Christian dispensation , followers of the risen Jesus have been waiting . Paul , Augustine , Chrysostom , Agnes , Thomas Aquinas , Clare , Francis , John Henry Newman , and Simone Weil have all waited for the Second Coming and have hence all been Advent people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our eyes and hearts upward and praying , " Ich warte , ich warte .
