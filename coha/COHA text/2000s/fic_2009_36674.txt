Max saw him first . Then I saw him out of the corner of my eye . A hundred yards downriver from my dock was a man chest-deep in the river . He held a long pole , prodding underwater as if searching for something . Maybe it was because I 'd clocked too many years in law enforcement , but it looked like he was searching for a body . He was coming my way . <p> " Think a gator will get him before he can make it to the dock ? " I said to Max as she cocked her head and trotted to the end of the dock . Max , my nine-pound dachshund , let out a slight whimper as she watched the man in the distance . He did n't look our way as he poked and prodded the riverbed . <p> I turned and got back to the work I was doing , searched through my open toolbox for four-inch nails and found a hunting knife under my hammer . I glanced back at the man . He was still a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the pouch he carried . <p> After sniper training , after my time in the first Gulf War , I still calibrated distance in trajectory  --  what I had to do to make sure a .50 caliber rifle bullet hit a target the size of a grapefruit a quarter mile away . I looked at the river 's surface . There was no wind . The man walking in the river wore a wide-brim hat . From where I stood , I could aim with a scoped rifle , if I had one , for the middle of the hat , right above the brim . From this distance , the bullet would hit him dead center in the forehead . <p> I blinked hard . Enough . Not everybody is a hostile . Not everybody is homicidal or a homicide suspect . I swatted a deerfly and inhaled deeply . It was spring , and the river carried the smells of renewing life . Alligators building nests out of sand , sticks , and river mud . Spoonbills and herons feeding live fish to squalling young . Honeysuckles sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the toolbox and laid it on the wooden bench . I looked over my shoulder at the man in the distance and began driving a nail into the wood as I replaced worn and broken planks on the long bench . The morning was already hot , near eighty , I guessed . I was shirtless , wearing jeans . Sweat rolled down my back as I hit the nails . <p> My uncle Bill , a World War II vet who never spoke of the war , only the demons he fought after it , used to say that anger drives the nails into your own coffin . He also said that every man has his breaking point . After a thirteen-year career as a homicide detective , I began to understand what Uncle Bill meant . <p> It 's gut rot of the soul , and it was the most pervasive part of the job in fighting crime . In homicide , I did n't fight crime . The crime had happened before we arrived . I fought the motivation , the detached switch that allowed someone to derail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had pierced the scab covering a dark ember in my marrow , and the buried ash smoldered beneath the surface of night sweats . <p> I pounded another nail so deep into the wood I could n't see the head . After my wife , Sherri , died of ovarian cancer six months ago , I moved here to this remote spot on Florida 's St. Johns River , with Max . Sherri had bought the miniature dachshund when I 'd been away on a three-day stakeout . She named her Maxine and allowed her sleeping quarters at the foot of our bed on her own " doggie blanket . " When I 'd returned home , my wife said that Maxine was the only other warm body she 'd let in our bed . I could n't argue that , and so this little dog , with her soft brown eyes , permanent eyeliner , and the heart of a lion , became our companion . <p> Now it was just the two of us , and Max was sleeping under the blanket on her side of the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My new home was an old Florida cracker house with a large tin roof , plenty of rambling rooms , a huge screened-in porch , and a generous view of the river . The house sat on one of the few high banks overlooking the river . Most of them were bluffs of ancient Indian shell mounds . The native people had lived off the river , eating fish , clams , and oysters . They piled the shells and bones into mounds up and down the river . <p> " Dog 's gon na be a meal for a gator if it gets too close to the edge . " <p> I whirled around and saw the man , now less than fifty feet from my dock . How had he walked that quickly ? Had I been pounding the nails so hard I did n't hear Max bark ? Did she bark ? She stood there , little paws at the edge of the dock , tail wagging , looking at the man in the river . <p> He wore an Australian outback hat that looked as old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , water up to his chest , the pole tapping the unseen . Max finally uttered a low growl . <p> " It 's okay , Max , " I said . She looked back at me like she did n't believe me . I glanced at the knife on the bench and looked at the man . <p> He held his hat and slowly dropped down into the river , the dark water covering him . Within seconds , he was gone . <p> Excerpted from A FALSE DAWN by TOM LOWE <p> Copyright 2009 by Tom Lowe <p> Published in April 2009 by St.Martin
