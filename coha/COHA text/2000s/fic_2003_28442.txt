Chapter One Natalie Winford knew she had just made the biggest mistake of her life . She did n't regret a minute of it . Rum punch , she thought . They could both blame it on the rum punch , if they had to blame it on anything . Outside , she heard the harbor water slap lightly at the yacht . Here in the master cabin , a stray sunbeam through the porthole burnished Patrick Barr 's tanned skin to molten gold as he lay amid the tangled sheets . Natalie never wanted to move again . She yearned to lie forever in Patrick 's arms , suspended in this magic interval after making love . " Nat ? " he murmured . " Right here . " At such close range , she was acutely aware of the man 's lime-scented cologne and the well- proportioned build that testified to his high-school and college days as a competitive diver . Playfully she ran her hand across the muscles of his shoulders and back , relishing their sculpted power . Until now , she 'd only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , she 'd answered his phone calls , sorted his mail , scheduled his appointments and fantasized about him from a distance . Until today . When Patrick first took over as administrator of the Doctors Circle Clinic and Birthing Center from his disorganized predecessor , Natalie had been relieved to work for a man she respected . Over the years , her feelings had developed into intense admiration . Now she drank in every detail of the man in bed beside her . She treasured his strong , sensitive nose and the two pucker lines between his intelligent brown eyes . She cherished his thick brown hair , although it was a little too long because , as usual , he 'd been too busy to stop by a barbershop . Patrick seemed to be making his own assessment of Natalie , she noticed as his gaze trailed from her breasts up to her soft lips . " You always look terrific , but the view is even better without clothes , " he said . After a moment 's reflection , he added ruefully , " On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation without thinking . " " If you 're about to say you wish we had n't done this , I 'll kick you out of bed , " Natalie said . He flashed a warm , masculine smile . " I could n't possibly regret it . But ... " " I know . " She sighed . " My behavior hardly meets your high standards . " Patrick ran his hand through his already rumpled hair . " You have n't done anything wrong . I 'm the one who needs to set a good example for the community . " Until she met her boss , Natalie had n't known anyone could be so hard on himself or so exacting with his staff . She wished she 'd been raised with the same insistence on honesty and integrity , but not everyone had the advantage of two stable parents with high ideals . In any case , making love with Patrick did n't break the rules as far as Natalie was concerned . A twenty-nine-year-old woman had a right to find happiness with a single man , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might only last one afternoon . " You did set a good example today , during the cruise , " she said . " The community loved what you said about Doctors Circle 's future plans . That 's why the pledges came rolling in . " The luncheon outing aboard Patrick 's yacht had launched a nine-month-long Endowment Fund drive aimed at raising thirty million dollars , enough to put Doctors Circle on firm financial footing for years to come . The movers and shakers of Serene Beach , California , had responded by opening their checkbooks . Most of them were aware that the yacht , Melissa , was named after the infant sister Patrick never knew . It was her loss from lung problems and prematurity that had inspired his parents , once they overcame poverty and rose to prominence in the business community , to establish a center to save other babies . After the guests and crew left , Natalie and Patrick had sat on deck toasting their success with rum punch . They 'd been exhilarated , energized and intensely attuned to each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what had finally overcome their inhibitions , and she did n't care . She just wanted to stay here in his cabin forever and forget that the rest of the world existed . " It was a great kickoff , thanks in large part to you . " Patrick stretched lazily . Although the August sun lingered outside , it was past seven o'clock . " If only they could see you now . " Teasingly , Natalie traced a finger down the center of his chest . " On second thought , I 'd rather keep you to myself . " " You 're in a wonderful mood , " he said . " You ought to be , too . " " I am . " He pulled her tighter against him . " You know , I just got a terrific idea . " " For the next fund-raiser ? " Natalie asked . " Something a little more personal . " Angling toward her , Patrick cupped the back of her head with his hand . He scanned her face as if trying to memorize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His kiss exploded with yearning . Natalie melted against him , yielding to his tongue 's demands and savoring the sensation of being held close . When Patrick lifted his head , she kissed the V of his collarbone . " I think I figured out your idea . " " Do you approve ? " " Utterly , " she said . He reached into a drawer for more protection , and then he pushed her gently down against the sheet .
