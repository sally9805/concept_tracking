<p> She is all of 19 years old , but Marissa Irvin is ready to hang it up . The amateur life does n't suit her anymore . Frankly , it just does n't pay to be the best collegiate tennis player in the country . <p> So now it 's on to the pros , the inevitable next step for a player who has dominated every other level of tennis to date . The Stanford sophomore , ranked No. 1 by the Intercollegiate Tennis Association , has concluded there 's nothing more to be gained by squashing opponents in USTA tournaments or breezing through NCAA matches . <p> Ask her how she 'll fare and Irvin  --  brash and confident , but with the credentials to back it up  --  does n't hold back . She 's convinced she can be the best player in the world . <p> " Why not ? I do n't think it 's worth playing if you do n't aspire to be No. 1 , " Irvin said in January , shortly after she shrugged off a second-round loss to Lindsay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point hoping just to make the top 10 or something like that . You 'll probably never get there . " <p> It was a strong statement , Irvin admits today . But truthful . She 's certain she can beat Davenport the next time they meet . " I have the capability of playing at a level where I can beat almost anyone , or give anyone a tough night , " Irvin said . <p> With only a smattering of appearances to her credit , Irvin nonetheless has moved steadily up the Women 's Tennis Association rankings , reaching No. 78 this week . Beginning next month , she 'll begin a full-time assault on No. 1 . <p> " I 've done everything I want to do individually in college tennis so far , except hopefully win a national championship . This year , I 've wanted to focus on the team , " said Irvin , who has her sights set on that final hurdle next week , when she joins her Cardinal teammates in the NCAA championships at Pepperdine in Malibu . <p> In truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resume , considering what 's bound to lie ahead . After taking Elena Likhovtseva , the then-No. 20 player in the world to three sets as a wild-card entrant in last year 's Bank of the West Classic and making such a strong showing in her Grand Slam debut , many are convinced Irvin has top-25 potential . <p> Irvin , a qualifier in Melbourne , lost to the second-seeded Davenport 6-4 , 7-5 , playing aggressively and using her inside forehand and serve to pin one of the game 's best players behind the baseline . " A lot of people may have figured I 'd go out and lose 0 and 0 . ' But I knew a lot of my friends back here would be watching , " Irvin said with a giggle , " so I did n't want to embarrass myself . " <p> She took a 5-2 lead in the second set , only to see Davenport storm back for the win . It was an attention-getting performance , and Irvin was urged to take advantage of the momentum and forsake her Stanford scholarship and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Not so fast . <p> At the junior and NCAA level , Irvin 's success has gotten her exactly what a young player needs  --  more matches and more experience . Sure , there 's a big difference between the Pac-10 championships and the French Open . But , how much experience does a player gain if she 's consistently bounced out of early rounds ? <p> More importantly , Irvin 's two-year taste of college life has given her something far more valuable : maturity . And a level head . <p> " I suppose I have n't traveled as much as some people or played in as many big tournaments , because there has n't been time to . But at the same time , for me , this has been the best situation , " Irvin said . " I 'm at school ; I 'm happy ; I 'm with my friends . If I were out on the tour , tennis would be my whole life . So this has been a good transition . <p> " For a lot of kids , tennis is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me school has been the most important thing . " <p> The Santa Monica native is getting a late jump on the WTA tour , considering the teen-aged debuts of fellow Southern California contemporaries such as Venus Williams and Alexandra Stevenson , both of whom never eclipsed Irvin in the USTA junior ranks . <p> Irvin , though , is far from a late bloomer . If anything , she 's a late arrival . Irvin and her family are determined to avoid the pitfalls of those who came before her . <p> " Every one of these casualties has confirmed our decision making . Right now I do n't think we 've made one bad decision in regards to her tennis career , " Irvin 's mother Helene said . <p> The proof is there . Williams , 19 , ranked No. 4 in the world , winner of nine WTA tour titles , a 1997 U.S. Open finalist and 1999 Australian Open and Wimbledon quarterfinalist , already is so burned out , she is considering retirement . <p> Stevenson , who is six months younger than Irvin , grabbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , renounced her amateur status midway through the tournament amid reports , later confirmed , that former NBA star Julius Erving was her biological/absentee father . <p> Since then , she has not advanced past the second round of any major tournament and lost an opening-round match last week in the Italian Open after reaching the field as a qualifier . <p> In many ways , Stevenson 's rocky pro journey has served as a measuring stick for Irvin . It was Irvin , not Stevenson , who was the nation 's No. 1-ranked junior in 1997 and ' 98 . Two years ago , Irvin was part of a six-member junior national team that included Stevenson . All but Irvin have turned pro . <p> Irvin and Stevenson teamed up to win the U.S. Open girls doubles title in 1997 , and Irvin clearly was the better singles player then , a nine-time junior national singles title winner . She also won four of the five matches against Stevenson in 1996 , the last year they played head-to-head . <p> " In juniors , I was always ranked higher than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been kind of a confidence boost to me . I figure if she can do it , I can , too , " Irvin said of Stevenson . " But at the same time , who knows if what happened last year was a fluke ? Because she has n't really backed it up with anything . <p> " Alexandra has done well , and her ranking has remained , so we 'll see what happens when Wimbledon rolls around and there are points to defend . For her sake , I hope she continues to do well . " <p> Stevenson , at the urging of her sportswriter mother , Samantha , turned down a tennis scholarship to UCLA to pursue pro tennis , a decision many in the tennis world speculated was driven by the desire for fame and riches . So far , neither really has materialized . <p> " Alexandra is a good girl . But my gosh , what a mistake , " said Helene Irvin , who 's well acquainted with the outspoken Samantha Stevenson . " We look at this now and say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's coach Frank Brennan has reason to be grateful Irvin took him up on his scholarship offer two years ago . With Irvin at No. 1 , the Cardinal are in prime position to defend their team title . <p> But Irvin , Brennan noted , also has a tendency to play down to opponents , a sign that perhaps she 's exhausted all she can glean from NCAA competition . To wit , an uninspired Irvin was upset last weekend in the second-round of the NCAA team championships , losing to No. 41 Kim Niggemeyer of Fresno State at Taube Family Tennis Center . The Berlin native , who prevailed 6-4 , 4-6 , 6-2 , handed Irvin her first loss in 21 matches this season . <p> " She 's done a wonderful job . It 's a whole different feeling , being No. 1 in the country and being on top , " Brennan said of Irvin . " But every school has a No. 1 player . So every match , she has to battle . She has to bring it every game . That 's something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Although the competition might be underwhelming , Irvin raves about college life and the camaraderie of playing on a team . She counts members of the Stanford baseball team and women 's volleyball squad as close buddies , and the thought of leaving it all behind saddens her . <p> To that end , Brennan , the grandfatherly coach , also is glad Irvin resisted the urge to bypass the college experience , even if for a little while . " She 's grown up so much . You do n't grow up as fast on the pro circuit , " he said . " You 've got people around you taking care of you all the time . Here , she 's on her own , and she has the boyfriends and classes and is taking care of her life . " <p> Some lessons have been priceless . Earlier this year , Irvin found herself facing a difficult draw , UCLA 's top-ranked singles player , Sarah Walker . The two have been lifelong friends . <p> On a personal level , the stakes were enormous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident a month earlier , was emotionally drained . Irvin was distraught at the thought of playing against her . <p> Midway through the match , Walker began weeping uncontrollably , and Irvin went across the court to hug her friend . " Yet she knew she had to play on , and she had to win , " Helene Irvin said . " Marissa won in straight sets , as fast as she could . " <p> As humanely as she could . That balance Irvin 's family and coaches stressed to her had shone through . <p> " I ca n't put a price on the things I 've learned since I 've been in college , " Irvin said . " I 'm so glad that I was here . Nothing can replace being an 18-year-old freshman in college . I 'm not going to have many shots to play professionally . But so far , this has really been the experience of a lifetime . "
