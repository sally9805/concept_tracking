1 From the dream journals Last night the snake came to me . I was surprised , though little surprises me nowadays . He was more beautiful than I remembered . His plated green skin shone like rainwater on banana plants in the garden plot we used to tend behind the dream caves . But maybe as I grow older I begin to see beauty where I never expected it before . I said , It 's been a while , friend . But I do n't blame you for that . Not anymore . To show he bore me no ill will either , he widened his eyes . It was like a flash of sun on a sliver of mirror glass . The last time he 'd appeared was a time of great change in my life , a time first of possibility , then of darkness . He had not returned after that , though I 'd cried and called on him until I had no voice left . Why did he come now , when I was finally at peace with my losses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my fists and let the things I longed for slip from them ? His body glowed with light . A clear , full light tinged with coastal purples , late afternoon in the cypresses along the Pacific . I watched for a while , and knew he had come to foretell another change . But whose -- and what ? Not a birth . Rakhi would n't do that to herself , single mother that she is already . Though all my life that child has done the unexpected . A union , then ? Rakhi returning to Sonny , as I still hoped ? Or was a new man about to enter her life ? The snake grew dim until he was the color of weeds in water , a thin echo suspended in greenish silt . It was a death he was foretelling . My heart started pounding , slow , arrhythmic . An arthritic beat that echoed ineach cavity of my body . Do n't let it be Rakhi , do n't let it be Sonny or Jonaki . Do n't let it be my husband , whom I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invisible as he curled and uncurled . Hieroglyphs , knots , ravelings . I understood . Will it hurt ? I whispered . Will it hurt a great deal ? He lashed his tail . The air was the color of old telegraph wire . Will it at least be quick ? His scales winked yes . From somewhere smoke rolled in to cover him . Or was the smoke part of what is to come ? Will it happen soon ? A small irritation in the glint from his eyes . In the world he inhabited , soon had little meaning . Once again I 'd asked the wrong question . He began to undulate away . His tongue was a thin pink whip . I had the absurd desire to touch it . Wait ! How can I prepare ? He swiveled the flat oval of his head toward me . I put out my hand . His tongue -- why , it was n't whiplike at all but soft and sorrowful , as though made from old silk . I think he said , There is no preparation other than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it can be a beginning , too . A chance to gain back what you 'd botched . Can you even remember what that was ? I tried to think backward . It was like peering through a frosted window . The sand-filled caves . The lessons . We novices were learning to read the dreams of beggars and kings and saints . Ravana , Tunga-dhwaja , Narad Muni --  . But I 'd given it up halfway . He was fading . A thought flowed over my skin like a breath . But only if you seize the moment . Only if -- Then he was gone . 2 Rakhi My mother always slept alone . Until I was about eight years old , I did n't give it much thought . It was merely a part of my nightly routine , where she would tuck me in and sit on the edge of my bed for a while , smoothing my hair with light fingers in the half dark , humming . The next part of our bedtime ritual consisted of storytelling . It was I who made up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age who lived on a planet named Agosolin III and led an amazingly adventurous life . I would have preferred the stories to have come from my mother , and to have been set in India , where she grew up , a land that seemed to me to be shaded with unending mystery . But my mother told me that she did n't know any good stories , and that India was n't all that mysterious . It was just another place , not so different , in its essentials , from California . I was n't convinced , but I did n't fret too much . Nina-Miki 's adventures ( if I say so myself ) were quite enthralling . I was proud of being their creator , and of having my mother , who was a careful listener , as my audience . When the story was done my mother would kiss me , her lips as cool as silver on my forehead . Sleep now , she whispered as she left , shutting the door behind her . But I 'd lie awake , listening to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corridor . She 'd stop at the door to my dad 's bedroom -- that was how I thought of the big , dark room in the back of the house with its large , too soft bed and its tie-dyed bedspread -- and I 'd hear the companionable rumble of their voices as they talked . In a few minutes I 'd hear his door closing , her footsteps walking away . She moved quietly and with confidence , the way deer might step deep inside a forest , the rustle of her clothes a leafy breeze . I 'd listen until I heard the door to the sewing room open and close , the sigh of the hinges . Then I 'd let go and fall into the chocolate-syrup world of my dreams . I dreamed a great deal during those years , and often my dreams were suffocatingly intense . I 'd wake from them with my heart pounding so hard I thought it might burst . When I could move , I 'd make my way down the dark corridor by feel . Under my fingers the walls were rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to the sewing room . I did n't know why she called it that ; she never sewed . When I opened the sighing door , I 'd see her on the floor , face turned to the wall , covers drawn up over her head , so still that for a moment I 'd be afraid that she was dead . But she 'd wake immediately , as though she could smell me the way an animal does her young . I 'd try to crawl under her blanket , but she always took me -- firmly but kindly -- back to my own bed . She lay by me and stroked my hair , and sometimes , when the nightmare was particularly troubling , she recited words I did n't understand until I fell back into sleep . But she never stayed . In the morning when I awoke , she would be in the kitchen , making scrambled eggs . The sewing room would be bare -- I never knew where she put her bedding . The carpet was n't even flattened to indicate that someone had slept there . My discovery occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the home of one of my classmates . This was a rare event because , in spite of my mother 's urgings , I did n't tend to socialize much . Children my own age did not seem particularly interesting to me . I preferred to follow my mother around the house , though she did n't encourage this . On occasion , I listened from behind a door as she spoke on the phone , or watched her as she sat on the sofa with her eyes closed , a frown of concentration on her forehead . It amazed me how still she could be , how complete in herself . I tried it sometimes . But I could keep it up for only a few minutes before I 'd get pins and needles . I 've forgotten the girl 's name , and why in the course of the afternoon we went into her parents ' bedroom , but I do remember her telling me not to jump on her parents ' bed , they did n't like it . " You mean your mom sleeps here -- with your dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sure she does , " the girl replied . " You mean your mom does n't ? " Under her incredulous eyes , I hung my guilty head . " You guys are weird , " she pronounced . After that afternoon , I undertook a course of serious research . One by one , I went to the homes of the children I knew ( they were not many ) and , between games and snacks and TV , checked casually into their mothers ' sleeping arrangements . Finally I was forced to conclude that my family was , indeed , weird . Armed with the statistics , I confronted my mother . That was when I made the other discovery , the one that would nudge and gnaw and mock at me all my growing-up years . My mother was a dream teller . The discovery did not come to me easily . My mother disliked speaking about herself and , over the years of my childhood , had perfected many methods for deflecting my questions . This time , though , I persisted . " Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Or at least with me , like Mallika 's mother does ? Do n't you love us ? " She was quiet for so long , I was about to ask again . But then she said , " I do love you . " I could hear the reluctance in her voice , like rust , making it brittle . " I do n't sleep with you or your father because my work is to dream . I ca n't do it if someone is in bed with me . " My work is to dream . I turned the words over and over in my mind , intrigued . I did n't understand them , but I was in love with them already . I wanted to be able to say them to someone someday . At the same time , they frightened me . They seemed to move her out of my reach . " What do you mean ? " I asked , making my voice angry . There was a look on her face -- I would have called it despair , if I had known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other people , " she said . " So I can help them live their lives . " I still did n't understand , but her face was pale and tight , like a cocoon , and her hands were clenched in her lap . I did n't have the heart to badger her further . Had n't she admitted to the most important thing , that she loved us ? I nodded my head as though I were satisfied with her explanation . Her smile was laced with relief . She gave me a hug . I could feel the remnants of stiffness in her shoulders . " Why do n't you decide what you want for dinner ? " she said . " You can help me cook it , if you like . " I allowed myself to be diverted and asked for ravioli . I 'd had it for the first time on that fateful afternoon in my classmate 's house . At home we rarely ate anything but Indian ; that was the one way in which my mother kept her culture . She had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cookbook . We spent the rest of the afternoon rolling , crimping , stuffing dough with cheese . The ravioli turned out lumpy , and the kitchen was a disaster , sauce smeared everywhere and shreds of cheese underfoot , but we were delighted with ourselves . In the middle of boiling the ravioli my mother turned to me and said -- though I had n't shared my classmate 's words with her --  " Rakhi , remember this : being different does n't mean that you 're weird . " She startled me in this manner from time to time , referring to things she could n't possibly know . But her clairvoyance was erratic . It would create problems for us over the years , making her ignorant of events I expected her to know , secrets I longed to tell her but could n't bear to speak of . For example : the reason why I left Sonny . At dinner Father admired the creative shapes we 'd made and said it was a meal at once delicious and instructive . He cleaned up the kitchen afterward , humming a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands encased in neon yellow rubber gloves . He was the tidy one in our household , the methodical one , always kind , the one with music . My mother -- secretive , stubborn , unreliable -- could n't hold a tune to save her life . I wanted to be just like her . Years later , after she died , my father would say , " Not true . She did n't love me , not really . She never let me get that close . The place right at the center of her -- that was reserved for her dream gods or demons , whoever they were . She never shared that with anyone . Not even you . " And I would be forced to admit that he , too , was right . * * *
