State Laws Prevent Choice <p> The Internet enables consumers to choose from an unprecedented array of sellers and methods of salesmanship . But the prospect of consumers buying cars from Web sites has some automobile dealerships worried . To crack down on car sales on-line , dealership associations in Texas , Florida , Wisconsin , Nebraska , Louisiana , Kentucky , Virginia , Arizona , South Carolina , and Utah have urged legislators and regulators to pass new laws and reinterpret old ones . <p> On-line automobile sales can take several forms . One form , the use of a Web site by a traditional dealer to sell directly to the public , is legal ; most other forms , however , are not . A car manufacturer might set up a Web site to sell cars directly to the public , bypassing dealerships . That type of Web site is illegal in about 40 states , because automobile franchise laws outlaw the sale of cars directly to the public from manufacturers . Franchise laws are general and thus not directed specifically at Internet activity ; however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of making the first type of Web site illegal . <p> For example , a manufacturer that owns an equity interest in a dealership might use a Web site to sell to the public . Automobile manufacturers have shown an increased interest in buying dealerships . General Motors , for example , announced that it would buy 770 GM dealerships over the next decade , a plan from which it has since retreated . Ford created an " Auto Collections " arm to consolidate dealerships in Salt Lake City and Tulsa . The manufacturers ' interest in dealerships stems in part from a desire to respond directly to consumer interest in options like " no-haggle " pricing and Jiffy Lube-style rapid service centers affiliated with dealerships . It also stems , in part , from the need to balance the power of large distributor groups like AutoNation . In several states , traditional independent dealerships have responded to those developments by urging legislators to expand franchise laws further to limit manufacturers ' acquisitions of equity interests in dealerships . This move indirectly affects Internet sales by preventing manufacturers from using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A manufacturer might set up a Web site describing the prices and the features of cars for sale but would refer customers to a local dealer to close the deal and obtain the car . But even that type of Web site can run afoul of regulators . Ford established just such a site at www.fordpreowned.com/ . The site enables consumers to review information about used Ford cars , including the prices , and to choose a car . Ford then informs the customer of a local dealership at which the desired vehicle is available and ships the car to the dealer if necessary . The dealer benefits not only by earning a fee for processing the transaction but also from realizing savings due to reduced overhead for advertising , storage , and floor space . <p> In Texas , state regulators ruled that , because the Web site gave prices for cars , Ford was illegally engaged in the direct sale of cars . The state threatened Texas dealerships that had participated in Ford 's program with a $10,000 per day fine . Ford shut down the Web @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A new law just passed in Arizona may have similar implications for the operation of Ford 's Web site service for that state . <p> The Internet creates the possibility of huge virtual used-car lots . In recent years , several companies have formed to buy up a large selection of used cars and offer them for sale on-line . So far , those companies have captured only a tiny amount  --  less than 3%  --  of the automobile sales market . Many consumers visit the sites to learn about different models and options but ultimately buy a car by traditional means . Nevertheless , this business has considerable growth potential . The companies have proven their willingness to experiment with novel business models that will be attractive to those alienated from traditional sales methods . The experiments include " haggle free " pricing and , in one case , a controversial site designed especially for women buyers . Some virtual car lots , including Autobytel.com , CarPoint.msn.com , and Autoweb.com , operate like the Ford site by providing information and referring the customer to a dealer for a final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " model , which helps private sellers meet private buyers . Auto.priceline.com , AutoNationDirect.com , CarsDirect.com , CarOrder.com , DriveOff.com , and Greenlight.com sell directly to consumers . <p> Those sites are hampered primarily by state licensing laws , such as those in Texas , that ban the " brokering " of cars . California 's less restrictive law requires brokers to obtain a state license . The National Association of Motor Vehicle Boards and Commissions is working on a model law for brokering on-line ; the new rule likely will have considerable impact on virtual car lots . <p> Franchise Laws Not Pro-Consumer . Franchise laws that inhibit the spread of on-line car sales are defended as protections for both consumers and dealers . As the president of a Texas Automobile Dealers Association says , franchise laws that bar auto sales by anyone other than a franchised dealer are there for consumer protection . He offers examples of how franchise laws have served consumers : <p> " Over the past several years , new car dealers have helped pass legislation that outlaws and punishes fraud and questionable practices in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... a guarantee to every vehicle title sold , a guarantee that the odometer has not been rolled back , disclosures of vehicle history ... and a ... ' lemon law . ' The new car dealers have the responsibility to process all the required paperwork and collect taxes and fees for the state . " <p> The dealer 's ability to offer a local service relationship to a customer is certainly one of the dealer 's strongest selling points and may be part of the reason that car sales are slow on many Web sites . Many consumers go there to learn but buy from traditional dealers . <p> However , consumers who are not happy with local dealers should not be banned from seeking alternatives to local service arrangements . The consumers ' interest in reliable local service suggests that they would also have a strong interest in dealerships that provide fast and honest service . Franchise laws have impeded the evolution of such dealerships . <p> It would have been logical , for example , for dealerships to have been the first to offer fast , inexpensive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to the punch . A type of franchise law known as the Relevant Market Area ( RMA ) law prevented dealers from pursuing the option first . RMA laws give dealers within one local market the power to oppose " disruptive " innovations such as service centers put forward by other dealers . <p> Laws that " protect " the consumer are likely to do more harm than good when they restrict competition . From the consumers ' standpoint , restritions on Internet auto sales look like another way to deny them choice among car services . <p> The second argument in favor of franchise laws is that such laws are necessary to protect dealers from manufacturers . Several goals underlie that argument . One goal , already addressed , is to protect consumers ; another goal is to protect jobs . A related argument might be that preserving dealerships is a good in itself  --  that businesses have a " right " to remain in business , even if market conditions change . <p> The danger to dealerships posed by a manufacturer 's using the Internet to compete with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program had many willing dealers who benefited from participating . Automobile manufacturers ' power today is checked by foreign competition and by powerful national chains of dealers like AutoNation , which owns over 400 dealerships around the country . State regulatory surveys have found little evidence that manufacturers would " abuse " dealers . The manufacturers continue to rely on the dealer model to maximize the seller 's incentives to distribute their cars enthusiastically and therefore need to preserve their reputations as reliable business partners . Even if manufacturers did stretch their rights under the franchise agreements , the remedy need not restrict competition by creating barriers to the entry of new dealers . <p> It is likely that the Internet will in the long run diminish the number of middlemen , such as real estate agents , travel agents , and car dealers . It is not written in the sky that one may buy bread from a baker , or a house from a builder , but may not buy a car from someone other than a local middleman-dealer . There is no reason to suppose that the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early part of the 20th century . Car dealerships do not " own " their customers ; those customers have a right to buy elsewhere if they so choose . Similarly , employees do not have a right to keep their jobs at the consumers ' expense . <p> Laws that protect businesses from upstarts ' raids on their customer base are not good for consumers . Such laws restrict competition and raise prices . Dealers admit that they fear Internet competition because on-line distributors , by bypassing the dealers , incur lower costs , which can mean savings for consumers . Two private studies and a Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) study found that automobile franchise laws that allow dealers to object to the location of a new dealer in their area  --  the RMA laws  --  mean higher prices for consumers . Limitations on auto sales on-line would also probably mean higher prices for consumers . <p> Many automobile regulators seem unable to question the view that the public 's interest lies with protecting the dealers and keeping the existing regulations as strong as possible . Carol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the car dealer is n't there , somebody from Midland could have to drive all the way to Dallas to get their warranty work done . " <p> But that is a very strange argument . The rise of service centers like Jiffy Lube shows that free markets respond to customers ' needs for service . Consumers already prefer to use independent service centers for repairs not under warranty , because their prices are often lower than the dealers ' prices . There 's no reason consumers need to have warranty work done by dealers , except that some state laws and regulations make it illegal for anyone but a dealer to offer warranty work . A number of states prohibit manufacturers from operating their own service centers . If there is a shortage of warranty service outlets , it would appear to be the result of regulation , not competition from the Internet . <p> By contrast , the FTC , as well as the auditors and attorneys general of several states , takes the view that competition would benefit consumers more than would RMA laws , which restrict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Given the findings of those state auditors and attorneys general , government support for restricting on-line auto sales to local dealers seems unlikely  --  except from the state regulators and legislators enjoying the closest relationship with automobile dealers ' associations . <p> State franchise and licensing laws that impede or block the operations of auto sales on-line harm consumers by restricting competition . Consumers want to use electronic information to educate themselves , assess their options , and sometimes conclude a sale . The Internet probably will not eliminate auto dealers because they have too much to offer in terms of local service . In the long run , automobile dealers can not be saved by protectionism any more than manufacturers of buggy whips could have been saved by laws restricting the sale of cars . On-line information and sales options are the wave of the future . Dealers that adapt to this reality will survive . <p> By Solveig Singleton <p> <p> Ms. Singleton is director of information studies at the Cato Institute .
