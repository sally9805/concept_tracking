The good news about church-based health and fitness programs // Walk by the sanctuary of New Life Ministries in New Orleans on a Tuesday evening , and you 'll likely hear the uplifting sounds of contemporary gospel music . But if you took a peek inside the sanctuary , you 'd be in for a surprise . The neat rows of chairs parishioners inhabit on Sundays are pushed off to the side so that Carla Alien , the first lady of the church , can lead as many as 100 parishioners and community members , including her husband , Pastor Glenn B. Alien , and their two children , ages 2 and 4 , in low-impact " praise aerobics . " " We 're praising and worshipping God , but not in the traditional way , " Carla Alien says . The thrice-weekly wellness ministry includes the hour-long aerobics classes and health and nutrition seminars , taught by Carla and guest medical experts . For inspiration , she quotes dietary instruction found in Leviticus and other Scripture to show class participants what the Good Book says about caring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that our bodies are the temple of the Holy Spirit , " Carla says . " But you have to do all you can to maintain it . " The number of faith-based exercise and wellness programs is exploding . Wander through a Christian bookstore , and you 'll probably find titles like Body by God and Moses Was n't Fat . When Alien hosted a praise-aerobics workshop at a recent convention for churchwomen , more than 600 participants joined her in doing jumping jacks for Jesus .

Health is widely recognized as a national concern , " says La Vita Weaver , a personal trainer , ordained ; minister and author of Fit for God ( Doubleday ) . ; " Now the church has begun to realize the many rewards of a healthy lifestyle . The healthier the congregation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our purpose in Christ . " Hallelujah ! Perhaps the church can help save Black folks from the dangerous rates of obesity , high blood pressure , diabetes , heart disease , stroke , cancer and other chronic conditions that claim too many of us . Studies and sisters alike testify that the fellowship hall is a great place to learn healthy eating habits , lose weight and get in shape . Research shows that Black women who implement such changes in a church setting are more likely to succeed than those who go it alone . In fact , one study of 500 Black women in 16 Baltimore churches suggests that those who augmented their lifestyle changes by participating in support groups offering health information and spiritual inspiration lost an average of 13 more pounds in one year than those who attempted losing weight on their own . These results are not surprising . Who would n't benefit from calling her prayer partner when that devil 's food cake lying in wait in the kitchen tempts , or receiving a word of encouragement in the sanctuary ? And the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop with exercise classes and health lectures . Some congregations have even improved that much-hallowed tradition : the church dinner . While the meal usually includes such all-time favorites as fried chicken and fish , macaroni and cheese , and peach cobbler , at New Life a healthy menu of turkey sandwiches , fruit salads and vegetable platters is the norm . And Alien went a step further when she startled church members by informing them that many dis eases that run in their families are passed down through the unhealthy ingredients in the family 's recipes . " That disease is not in your gene pool ; it 's in your recipes ! Get yourself some new recipes , " she encourages parishioners as she helps them identify healthy substitutes . The key to getting people to take better care of themselves is information , says Weaver . " I have observed over and over women asking the pastor to pray for them and anoint them for their illnesses , " says Weaver , whose own five-foot two-inch frame once carried 200 pounds . " Most of these diseases reflect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the devil . The devil had nothing to do with it ! It 's a lack of knowledge . The Bible says , " My people perish for lack of knowledge . ' " CAN I GET A WITNESS ? Armed with information and spiritual support , many sisters have found it easier to make positive changes . Before enrolling in gospel aerobics , Denise Jolly , 30 , struggled to shed ten pounds . " When I incorporated the fitness class , it made me more physically fit and I lost weight faster , " says the New Orleans nurse anesthetist . And unlike prior experiences at gyms , where she had a hard time connecting with others , Jolly made friends easily at New Life even though she attends a different church . " More people come back to class . You get to know them and talk to them . And if you have problems and trials , Allen will lift you up in prayer . We pray before we start and we pray when we finish . I think that blesses you with energy and helps you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sister , Pastor LaReese Brooks , 44 , also found that her faith helped her change her lifestyle . Last year the Capital Heights , Maryland , resident felt run-down , so she decided to heed her sister 's advice to study the Bible 's teachings on self-care . " I read about how God wants us to take care of His temple-how if we defile the temple , God will destroy it . " Realizing that her habits were undermining her well-being , Brooks set about making changes . " I got rid of sweets and replaced them with fruits . I got rid of red meat and replaced it with poultry and fish . I started eating more vegetables and drinking water . " Before the week was out she was overflowing with energy . Uplifted , she took this idea to her church : " I told them , let 's dejunk our temples together and fill our bodies with the things God wants us to eat , " Brooks recalls . The entire 100-person congregation embarked on a 21-day " unnatural-food " fast . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " Weaver says of their new food choices that included whole grain breads and cereals , brown rice and fresh fruits and vegetables . The plan worked . Church member Belinda Bugett , a 35-year-old personnel specialist , says she was addicted to sweets , but during the fast she cut them out . " The first week was very tough . My body felt fine , but the temptation was strong , " the married mother of twins admits . " But there were so many different things to substitute , and after that it was n't an effort for me . " Without dieting Bugett lost five pounds in the 21 days . " My energy level went through the roof , " she says . Photograph New Life pastor Glenn B. Allen and wife , Carla , hope to instill healthy habits in their children . // NAME IT AND CLAIM IT So if you need help becoming more active , eating healthier or losing weight , as many women do , why not tap into the power of the Holy Spirit , at church or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a wellness ministry , " start a support group , " Rev. Brooks recommends , and announce it at women 's fellowship and in service . " Ask church members with health expertise to help . " Solicit the aid of the doctors , nurses , social workers , dietitians , physician 's assistants , aerobics instructors and personal trainers in your congregation . Local hospitals , universities and health organizations such as the American Cancer Society often make pamphlets , educational videos and even outreach experts available to church groups . No matter where you do your spiritual workout , Alien suggests beginning and ending every health and fitness session with prayer . Arming yourself with Scripture about healthy self-image , overcoming adversity , faith , resisting temptation and the power of prayer may help . Many such passages are provided in Fit for God . When the spirit moves you to exercise , consider doing so with others . You can start a walking club on your block and incorporate gospel videos , CDs and yourfavorite songs for inspiration .
