John Adams is hot these days . First came the eerie parallels to the Bushes : a competent but uninspiring Vice President succeeds a charismatic President , serves only one term , is defeated by a liberal Southerner but lives to see his near namesake son restore the dynasty despite losing the popular vote to a populist from Tennessee . Now comes something even more exciting for his reputation : America 's most beloved biographer , David McCullough , has plucked Adams from the historical haze , as he did Harry Truman , and produced another masterwork of storytelling that blends colorful narrative with sweeping insights . <P> Though Adams had the same prickliness as Give-'Em-Hell Harry , he 's just not quite as colorful . From a family of Puritan farmers , Adams was honest and solid , but he could be argumentative , vain and despairing . In John Adams ( Simon &; Schuster ; 751 pages ; $35 ) , McCullough does not try to exalt him . Instead he shows how Adams ' ability to be sensible and independent made him an important element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Among those who gathered in Philadelphia in 1776 , Adams was one of the first to advocate independence . The following year , he was sent as an envoy to Paris , where he worked with Benjamin Franklin and later Thomas Jefferson . They were both more polished and popular than Adams  --  and certainly less Puritan in their approach to the pleasures of Paris . After the war Adams became America 's first ambassador to England , where he again proved stiffly reliable but devoid of the courtiers ' charms that counted for so much in the world of European diplomacy . <P> As Vice President , his first initiative was to tie up the Senate for a month debating what title should be used to address President George Washington . His efforts tarred Adams as a closet monarchist and made him a target for those too timid to take on Washington directly . Adams ' great goal was to keep American politics nonpartisan . In that he failed . When Washington retired , the election of 1796 became the first between two parties , with Jefferson leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unenthusiastic choice of the Federalists . Indeed , it was only because of the advent of party politics , and the Federalists ' ability to scrape together enough electors one last time , that Adams was able to win his single term . <P> Nevertheless , Adams governed in a responsibly nonpartisan way . One great issue was France , which was interfering with American shipping . The Republicans , admirers of the French Revolution , advocated peace ; the Federalists , spurred by Alexander Hamilton and Washington , spoiled for war . Adams defied his party , conducted a delicate diplomacy with Paris and ended up averting both war and the rise of the ambitious Hamilton as a military leader .
