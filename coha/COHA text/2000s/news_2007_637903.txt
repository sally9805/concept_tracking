<p> VIRGIL , Ill.  --  More people should know about Ernie Davis , actor Dennis Quaid says . <p> " I was unaware of the Ernie Davis story , " Quaid says during a break from filming The Express , about the famed Syracuse running back who trampled racial barriers and in 1961 became the first black player to win the Heisman Trophy . " There are a lot of people who do n't remember . " <p> Davis ' legacy lives in the memories of those who watched his thrilling runs and saw him lead Syracuse to its only national championship in football in 1959 . <p> He was on the verge of making his NFL debut with the Cleveland Browns when he was stricken with leukemia . The illness robbed him of the chance to team with former Syracuse star Jim Brown in the backfield and took his life at 23 . <p> Those who knew him say Davis was a consummate gentleman , a trait up-and-coming actor Rob Brown hopes to illustrate as he portrays Davis in the film . Quaid has the role of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago area and at Syracuse . <p> " You get the feeling he always tried to do the right thing , " Rob Brown says of Davis . <p> The movie , based on the 1983 biography Ernie Davis : The Elmira Express by Robert C. Gallagher , is expected to be released in October 2008 . <p> " It 's about time for a movie , " says Floyd Little , a former Denver Broncos running back who followed Davis at Syracuse and wore the same 44 on his jersey , also made famous by Jim Brown . Syracuse retired it in 2005 . " He 's so deserving . " <p> For every fan who knows the story , how Davis went from Elmira , N.Y. , to become the top college player as a 6-2 , 210-pound halfback , there are dozens more casual fans unaware of his place in history . <p> " I hope for people just to know who made it possible for guys like ( former Ohio State quarterback ) Troy Smith to win the Heisman , " Rob Brown says . <p> Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robinson , a Hall of Fame second baseman , broke baseball 's color barrier in 1947 . <p> " People know Jackie Robinson , " says John Brown , formerly a tackle with the Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers and Davis ' teammate at Syracuse . " But they do n't know Ernie . That bothers me . " <p> Gentleman and gentle man <p> The film could make Davis identifiable to younger generations . Yet some close to him worry it wo n't capture his essence . They say the classy way Davis carried himself exceeded his brawn . He was approachable , whether he gained 1 yard or 100 . <p> " Ernie was not only a gentleman , " John Brown says , " he was a gentle man . I hope they portray him as an articulate gentleman who could run like hell with a football . " <p> That 's how people in Elmira remember him , says Roland Coleman , who coached Davis on a traveling basketball team . He recalls Davis leading his team to victories but then going out of his way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to brag . " <p> An all-around athlete , Davis was spectacular in football and basketball at Elmira Free Academy , later Ernie Davis Middle School . It is said Schwartzwalder made 30 visits to recruit Davis in Elmira , about 90 miles southwest of Syracuse . The Express deals heavily with the relationship between the coach and Davis . <p> Schwartzwalder offered his recruiting pitch , but Davis was sold on Syracuse because of Jim Brown , a prolific running back for the Orange who accompanied the coach on a visit with Davis . Some think Jim Brown should have won the Heisman in his heyday but did n't because he was black . <p> Davis , however , could n't be denied . He broke many of Brown 's records and still holds the Syracuse career record for highest average per carry at 6.63 yards . Davis gained 2,386 rushing yards , eclipsing Brown 's 2,091 . In his Heisman-winning season , Davis rushed for 823 yards and 12 touchdowns . <p> A pivotal time came earlier , during Syracuse 's undefeated championship run . Davis played in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named the game 's outstanding back . But a fight with racial overtones broke out between the teams during the game and marred the event . <p> According to the biography , Syracuse skipped the bowl banquet because black players were n't allowed to attend . Davis would be allowed to receive his award but not eat dinner . John Brown disputes the account . He says the team attended but left immediately after dinner for another recognition event . <p> Sometimes even their teammates discriminated against them , and that memory remains vivid , John Brown says . He recalls before the Cotton Bowl rooming with Davis , black teammate Art Baker , a fullback who later played with Buffalo of the old American Football League , and a white player who explained he had to seek white roommates . Brown declines to name the player . <p> Schwartzwalder came under scrutiny in 1970 when nine players boycotted the team about racial issues , but John Brown offers a different view . " He brought us there , " Brown says , noting the reluctance of many coaches to recruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do under the circumstances of the times . " <p> Even after Davis won the Heisman and enjoyed a chat with President Kennedy , he found himself frustrated by prejudice . One incident came when Davis and John Brown were driving with Coleman from Pennsylvania to Virginia for a basketball game . <p> Coleman and Brown remember the restaurant they stopped at would n't serve them . <p> " I remember saying , ' This guy is an All-American , ' " Coleman says . " ' He had coffee with President Kennedy , and he ca n't get a hamburger ? ' " <p> Brown says Davis left the restaurant shaken . He had overcome a childhood problem of stuttering , but whenever he was nervous or excited , it returned . The incident left him stammering for words , Brown says . <p> The civil rights movement was n't as strong at the time , and players did n't lash out against discrimination , Brown says . " We were being taken care of , " he says . " So no matter what transpired , you accepted it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the team flourished in spite of prejudices . <p> " He radiated enthusiasm , " Schwartzwalder , who died in 1993 , told Sports Illustrated for a 1989 story . " His enthusiasm rubbed off on the kids . Oh , he 'd knock you down , but then he 'd run back and pick you up . We never had a kid so thoughtful and polite . Ernie would pat the guys on the back who had tackled him and help them up . And compliment them : ' Great tackle . ' Even opponents had a kindly feeling for him . " <p> It was no surprise Davis was the No. 1 pick in the 1962 NFL draft by the Washington Redskins . Cleveland traded for him and signed him to a three-year , $65,000 deal with a $15,000 signing bonus , then a record deal for a rookie . He was expected to join future Hall of Famer Jim Brown in the backfield , and the pair " would have been a monster , " John Brown says . <p> But before he played a game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diagnosis : acute monocytic leukemia . John Brown says Davis handled it " as if nothing was wrong . He never gave up hope . " <p> Davis badly wanted to play , but doctors never reached a consensus to clear him . Friends in Elmira , like fans across the country , were kept in the dark about the disease 's severity . Davis did n't want anyone worrying about him , Coleman says . <p> " It was the best-kept secret , " Coleman says . " He never complained . When my son asked him why he was n't playing , he said , ' I wanted to , but I just was n't up to it . ' Nobody paid that much attention . When you look at a superstar ... you never think the worst . " <p> Before entering the hospital for the last time , Davis stopped by the office of Cleveland Browns owner Art Modell , according to the biography . Davis apologized for the high cost of his medical bills and told Modell the hospital visit was n't anything serious , again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the significance of Davis ' visit . <p> " He was coming by to say goodbye to me and the others , " Modell says in the biography . <p> Davis died May 18 , 1963 . To this day , he remains the pride of Elmira . A statue was erected in his honor , and the neighborhood center where he spent spare time as a child was renamed for him . His mother , Marie Fleming , still lives there . She declined to be interviewed . <p> If he had n't died so young , " more people might know about him , " Rob Brown says . <p> If the actors have their way , many more will . <p> 1961 Heisman Trophy voting <p> Halfback Ernie Davis , Syracuse  --  824 points <p> Fullback Bob Ferguson , Ohio State  --  771 <p> Running back Jimmy Saxton , Texas  --  551 <p> Quarterback Sandy Stephens , Minn.  --  543 <p> Quarterback Pat Trammel , Alabama  --  362 <p> Source : Heisman Trophy website <p> PHOTO , B/W , John Zich , USA TODAY PHOTO , B/W , @ @ @
