Section : Mavericks MUSIC Bill Nguyen says he is trying to break the music industry 's addiction to hits . He also may be helping his customers break copyright law <p> Dressed in shorts and a T shirt , Bill Nguyen , 35 , breezed in 30 minutes late to a September meeting with his six board members , some of whom had flown in from Boston and Seattle . Nguyen ( pronounced " win " ) is the cofounder of an eight-month-old Web site called Lala in Palo Alto , Calif . On Lala people swap used CDs and buy new ones for less than what many retailers charge . They blog on the site about new music and chat up members with similar tastes . <p> The board was expecting an update on traffic stats and trading volumes , but one of the first things out of Nguyen 's perpetually smiling mouth was the announcement that , days earlier and without his investors ' knowledge , he had spent just under one million dollars to buy Woxy , a moneylosing Internet rock radio station that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nguyen , was that he pitched the deal on Woxy 's message board using the subject line " white knight , " initially misspelling the station 's name as Roxy . " I was surfing in Costa Rica and got confused . " The station 's owners closed the deal with Nguyen within days . " My investors were cool with it , once I told them , " he says . <p> Lala 's investors try not to get in the way . " Bill feels haphazard , but in fact he 's very intentional , " says Michael Krupka of Bain Capital . Bain has chipped in $5 million of the $9 million Lala has raised to date . <p> Nguyen 's stated intention is to reenergize the music industry . He speaks of Lala only in earthmoving terms : " I want to make the music industry hip again . I 'm going to undo the commoditization of music and bring back choice . Everything the industry does , we 'll do the reverse . " <p> It 's a grand statement of purpose , but at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piracy as it does to inspire listeners to buy more music . What 's to stop a customer from copying a CD to his hard drive before trading it in to get another ? Not much except compunctions about violating copyright laws . Note : The law clearly permits you to buy a CD and then copy it to your hard drive so that you can play it on your iPod . But you 're in controversial legal territory if you copy the music and then trade the CD to your neighbor . <p> Lala 's 200,000 members create " have " lists and " want " lists of their albums and trade with other members using Netflix-like postage-paid envelopes . It works like a barter club . Send off an album to another Lala member and you get a credit for one CD . You use that credit to obtain , from a different Lala member , a CD on your want list . For every CD you get in the mail , you pay Lala a buck as its middleman 's fee plus 75 cents to cover the postage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The music industry succeeded in shutting down Napster ( in its original incarnation ) for doing something very similar , namely , facilitating the copying of copyrighted music . In Napster 's case the transfers took place over the Internet . Here , the U.S. Postal Service is the medium of transmission . A key point in Lala 's defense is a portion of the U.S. <p>
