<p> The new ballpark for the Nationals , for which plans , drawings , artist 's renderings and a virtual computer tour were released yesterday , will either be one of the most stunning achievements in sports architecture in years , or it will be a handsome , expensive , amenity-packed , unobjectionable ballpark that falls somewhere in the middle of the major league pack . <p> The aesthetic and economic impact of the new park is completely up in the air , according to some of those who have designed it . This time the devil is n't in the details . Rather it is the potential for a spark of architectural divinity that lurks in those final finishing touches . Will Washington get its iconic anchor in Southeast with walls of glass rather than metal panel , with exterior walls made of limestone or precast concrete rather than cheap , ugly ground-face cinder block ? <p> In short , will the District make the same excellent choices on exterior finishes and details that make the Convention Center such a masterpiece , or will budget constraints reduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old stadium ? <p> To grasp the core of this debate , simply go to two Web sites and compare the visions of the ballpark . At www.washdcsports.com , you will find artist 's renderings of a perfectly fine ballpark . But I doubt you 'll say , " Wow ! " <p> Then go to www.washingtonpost.com and take the " Virtual Stadium Tour , " which makes you feel like you are in a helicopter flying around and into the ballpark . That second iteration of the Nationals ' park took my breath away . It is light , almost transparent at points , and unlike anything else in the sport . What Camden Yards did for Baltimore and baseball architecture 15 years ago , such a park in Washington might do in the early 21st century . The entire side of the park that faces South Capital Street is so open that the park would glow like a magic lantern into the city at night . <p> " The virtual tour is more like what we would hope the ballpark could be  --  something which has a very clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Purnell , one of the project 's head architects . " But that 's probably not going to happen with the current budget unless somebody steps up to the plate . It could be the team , if they understand how much difference it will make to them in the long run . " <p> Sports columnists exist to put their hands into the wallets of rich sports owners on behalf of the public . This is especially pleasant work since we do n't yet know the identity of the new owner . But we know what he ought to do . MLB stopped the bidding for this team at $450 million because it did n't want somebody it did n't prefer ( perhaps George Soros ) to " buy the pot " with a high offer . So any owner that MLB Commissioner Bud Selig chooses probably got a bargain and will know it . Chip in . <p> " From 10 to 20 million dollars could make a world of difference in the architectural impact of that park  --  that is , if the dollars were targeted for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did at the Convention Center : ' Do n't touch the exterior budget . ' All exterior costs are only 12 to 15 percent of the budget . The difference between the cheapest-possible-way materials and the best is only six or seven percent on a $300 million park  --  about $20 million . " <p> The unveiling of the park plans immediately presented D.C. with another huge opportunity as well as another big problem . The park 's elegant , airy design is a complete contrast to the bulky commercial buildings that may eventually encircle and threaten to engulf the stadium . The central justification for public funding of a new park was to spur economic development in bleak Southeast . That is entirely proper and must take priority . <p> However , HOK architect Joseph Spear was probably sending a sardonic message by putting those gruesome big-box parking garages in every rendering of the park : Build a stadium one block from a river , but have a panoramic view of garages beyond your outfield fences . " Yeah , it 's better if it 's not a garage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years , the park will need all the help it can get to escape being surrounded and overpowered by buildings that are still just gleams in the philistine eye of some retail , condominium or parking lot entrepreneur . Once again , the political juice , and perhaps the cash , of a powerful owner with local roots might be essential . <p> Development and a ballpark can and should coexist . But remember not to kill the golden goose in the center of the project . Modern baseball fans are experienced and demanding . They 've visited or watched games from almost every big league park . And there are 18 gaudy new ones in 15 years . In baseball , ballpark beauty not only sells but also has become essential . A $611 million ballpark that does n't make the heart race on a first , as well as a 10th , visit simply ca n't fulfill its financial function . <p> So , when the District and the team owner are trying to decide between glass , which opens up a city panorama , and metal panel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gorgeous exterior walls like the Convention Center 's and ersatz cinder block , let them remember that a true cost-benefit analysis requires a long-term view . Great parks hold their appeal for decades and even generations . Dodger Stadium still feels contemporary , and Yankee Stadium 's power never fades . But in just a few years , tacky tarnishes . Recent parks in Detroit and Cincinnati felt redundant or cheesy . It showed quickly in attendance . <p> In coming days , the public will be inundated with a long list of the new park 's multitudinous virtues . And those charms will be true . The Nats will have 21,170 seats ( counting Diamond and Founders clubs ) in the lower bowl . As a percentage of total seats ( 41,000 ) , that 's probably the best ratio in baseball ( close to the Phillies ) . The club level has 7,560 seats . So that 's 28,730 must-have ducats . Also , most of the 2,850 seats in the right field upper deck will be quite special with the views of the Capitol and distances from home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent ) seats in RFK . In any park , the first 10 rows of the upper deck should be first-rate . <p> So , where are the bad seats ? The press box , the first ever to be stuck in the nosebleed Bob Uecker section under the roof , is lousy . The press belongs in the 37,000th-best seat ; fans should get the good views . I applaud the decision as I weep . <p> Still , as Washington exalts as it sees what $611 million can build , do n't forget that what you see in this week 's drawings and cyber tours is n't really what you get . Nobody really knows what the final look and feel of this park will be . It 's in the details . <p> If the exterior of this ballpark , thanks perhaps to the financial help of the new owner , can be done in line with the architects ' preferences , then the cheers for this design may rival the hosannas for RFK Stadium when it was nationally celebrated in 1961 . If the development around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale that respects the integrity of the diamond at its center , then D.C. 's hard decision to build this park will draw decades of cheers . <p> If not , maybe we 'll be okay anyway . But do n't say I did n't warn you .
