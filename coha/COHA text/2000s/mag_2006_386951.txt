/Jan 2007 20 Time 's running out and you still have n't filled your tag ? Not to worry . Follow these tips to make the most of the best deer hunting of the season 20 HUNT BEFORE A STORM The rut is over , and so is the main crush of hunters in the woods . Though many big boys have gone nocturnal , they still have to eat and drink . As the weather grows colder and the number of hunters in the woods decreases , look for bucks to return to the familiarity  --  and safety  --  of their pre-rut home ranges . Was there a buck you scouted out before the season that seemed to go AWOL once the rut kicked in ? Well , with a little luck , he survived the barrage of opening-week gunfire and will return to his old haunt . Look for deer to move on the front edge of storms as they detect the drop in barometric pressure and begin to feed heavily . The first two days behind a front can also be productive . 19 FIND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bucks , thin and tired after several weeks of relentlessly chasing does , to suddenly focus their attention on eating . It 's crucial for whitetails to begin nourishing their bodies for the hard winter ahead . Follow the deer 's lead and home in on food sources that provide sufficient cover nearby . Mature oaks bordering grown-up clear-cuts , overgrown apple orchards , tangles of honeysuckle and food plots with late-season plantings are good places to look . Leave your gun or bow behind for several days and scout out these spots to learn which are being used . Not only will you discover where the deer are , but with the boys beginning to re-form their old bachelor groups now that they 're no longer in competition , you might get your pick of the biggest buck still around . 18 FOCUS ON NUT TREES Hard mast , such as acorns and hickories , provides the best source of protein for deer trying to survive the cold . Check areas where trees were dropping nuts earlier in the season . If the ground is covered with snow , look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nuts . If your property has white oaks that produced early in the season , set up downwind from these trees first ; they 're a whitetail 's favorite . 17 STALK IN NEW SNOW The best time to hit the woods is just after a new-fallen snow . But do n't waste time in a stand ; cover some ground . The fresh snow will muffle the sound of your footfalls , allowing you to ease silently along . Because the snow is fresh , there will be no question that the tracks you cut are recent . And best of all , deer will stand out like a sore thumb . 16 KEY ON CROPS Crop fields are also a top spot to target late-season bucks . Because deer are reluctant to travel far for food , small fields where patches of standing corn or milo alternate with wide swaths of cut rows are the best . Deer will hide among the standing plants , where they can feed without being seen . They may also venture along the edges of the cut rows in search of remnant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and easier to chew . 15 CHECK HIDEAWAYS When heavy snows descend , bucks head for the cover of large stands of evergreen or coniferous trees . The green , needle-covered limbs prevent much of the snowfall from reaching the ground , which makes it easier for deer to move about and find forbs or shoots to munch on . The trees also help deer to keep warm by blocking the wind . 14 WATCH FOR DROPOUTS During one post-Christmas deer drive , I was waiting along a power line that bisected a cedar stand when what I thought was a large doe came bounding straight for me . I took the deer from a mere 25 yards away , only to discover that it was a buck that had dropped its antlers early . From the look of the still-bloody bases , it had been a decent one to boot . The guy at the check station said it was the fourth one he had seen that week . If you or your hunt club practices quality management , do n't undercut your efforts by mistaking a buck that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to glass each deer before you shoot , particularly if you spot a doe that looks larger than usual . 13 DRAW DOWN Bowhunting Editor Todd Kuhn offers these tips to help keep your edge on stand : * Muscles cramp easily in the cold , making it hard to draw a bow . Consider reducing your draw weight by a few pounds . * Thick gloves are out when shooting a bow . Stow your hands in a muff with warmers inside to keep them toasty. * Stand and draw your bow every half hour to stay warm . 12 FOOL THEIR EYES A buck 's eyes are always looking to detect movement . With trees barren of leaves , a ground blind may provide better cover . Set up off a trail where you can take aim as a deer passes your blind . Aim when it is looking away from you . 11 LAYER UP To keep warm , Gander Mountain 's Casey Weisser suggests layering clothes . Start with a sweat-wicking polyester base layer , followed by a bonded fleece garment to trap heat and a waterproof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most does no longer in estrus , this time of the year may be the best to use a dragline doused with doe pee as you walk to your stand . A buck looking for one more dalliance might cut the trail and come your way . 9 TRY , TRY AGAIN While there are plenty of arguments over whether the second rut is of any strategic value to hunters , keep it in mind as you look to hit the woods in December . I agree with OL Whitetail Editor Michael Hanback that the second rut is overhyped see Whitetails , page 50 . Do n't expect to catch big bucks charging recklessly about the woods . However , it is a biological fact that a doe that was not bred during the rut will come back into estrus 28 days later , usually between December 5 and 15 ( though the start can vary by as much as a week on either side , depending on the region ) . This is a good time to hunt stand locations that you used when the rut began . Be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mimic the sound of a buck harassing a doe . It just may trigger a big boy 's final jealous fit of the season . 8 BUST SOME ICE As creeks and ponds freeze , focus your attention on areas where drinking water is still available . Flowing creeks and deeper water that has n't iced up are natural choices , though do n't be afraid to bust thin ice with your boots or a heavy branch , just as a waterfowler would to clear a landing hole for ducks . Keep the hole cleared for several days , if possible , to give deer a chance to locate it . In ice-laced swamps , you can funnel deer past your stand by busting an open path through the frozen water between pinch points of land . Deer would rather cross in water than crack through thin ice . 7 WALK THIS WAY Sure , deer stand out great in the snow , but binoculars should be considered an essential piece of gear on late-winter hunts , particularly when you 're still-hunting . Guns have been going off for weeks by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big bucks are particularly reluctant to move , even as a wandering hunter comes close ; most will sit tight , waiting for the danger to pass . When stalking , walk a few yards , stop next to a tree and carefully glass for several minutes before moving on and repeating . Watch for the horizontal lines of a deer 's brown back at odds with the dark vertical lines of standing trees . Keep your eyes peeled to catch any flicker of a tail or an ear . 6 HUNT DRIFTS Heavy snow kick-starts deer into moving for thicker cover ; add high winds , and it can actually determine which way they 'll go to get there . To avoid deep snow that accumulates along the lee side of hills or against the down-wind side of fields , deer will use the funnels that these drifts form . 5 SET UP ON TRAILS Snow-covered ground provides the perfect blueprint for a late-season hunt strategy . Identify the most heavily traveled trails and use the predominant direction of the tracks to determine whether deer are headed toward feeding or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good evening spots , while bedding-bound paths should be hunted in the morning . To discover if a buck has been frequenting a trail , check for prints that press deeper into the snow than the others and that exceed 4 inches in length or particularly 3 inches in width . 4 BE PREPARED Snow-covered terrain under cloudy skies makes navigating even familiar areas a challenge . Combine that with numbing temperatures and you have a real recipe for potential disaster should you become lost . For that reason , carry along a few extra items such as waterproof matches , liquid hand sanitizer ( its alcohol content makes it a great starter fuel ) , an emergency space blanket , a lithium-powered tactical light ( it 's brighter ) and snacks and water to make a day ( or night ) of it if you need to . If you enter the woods without fear of being stranded , you 'll hunt with the confidence you need to fill your tag . 3 WINTERIZE YOUR GUN Winter temps can wreak havoc on a rifle 's performance . Mike Schoby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , offers these tips : * Clean and degrease the action of your firearm . Use a solvent to remove the oil , which can congeal in extreme cold and actually hinder your gun 's performance . Coat parts with a graphite lubricant , which is n't affected by cold . * Wipe down the outside of the gun after each day afield , but not the inside . Stripping the muzzle of fouling can cause your first shots to be inaccurate . 2 SEEK THE SUN Bucks do n't always bed up in thick cover . Sometimes they 'll perch along slopes or in open woods , so they can see danger coming from afar . Look for south-facing slopes or small openings where there is more sunlight to keep deer warm . 1 MAKE A MINI-DRIVE The surest way to get bucks moving when they are reluctant to do so is to team up with a buddy and put on a drive . I like small tracts where you can focus on even smaller patches of cover . My friend Rob Copeland and I used to hunt a 70-acre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final weeks of deer season . We divided the thickest coverts into four to five grids , most no larger than 100 yards by 50 yards , and worked each one individually . The stander would post downwind , while the driver zigzagged from the upwind side , making no more noise than an occasional whistle . Each drive seldom lasted more than five minutes , but the deer that exploded from the tight cover were frequently heavy-racked dudes that we had n't even realized were there . Reference <p>                     @x HE ASKS HER <p> Early Fall 2007 <p> Claire Danner Crispin had never been so nervous about a lunch date in all her life . <p> " What do you think he wants ? " she asked Siobhan . <p> " He wants to shag you , " Siobhan said . Then she laughed as if the idea was preposterous and hysterical , which , indeed , it was . <p> Lock Dixon had called Claire at home and invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's something I 'd like to talk with you about , " he 'd said . " Are you free Tuesday ? " <p> Claire was taken completely by surprise . When she 'd seen his name on the caller ID , she 'd nearly let it go to voice mail . " Yes . Yes , I am . Tuesday . " <p> It was something to do with the charity , she decided . Since selling his company in Boston and moving to Nantucket year-round , Lock Dixon had graciously agreed to serve as the executive director of Nantucket 's Children , the island 's biggest nonprofit organization . " Graciously , " because Lock Dixon was so wealthy he never had to work again . Claire had joined the board of directors of Nantucket 's Children right before she became pregnant with Zack , but because of her fall in the hot shop and Zack 's premature birth and all the complications thereof , she had been little more than a name on the letterhead . Still , it was the charity , now , that connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too : the unspoken accusation about Daphne 's accident . Did Lock want to revisit the night of the accident now , years later ? Claire fretted . She buttoned her cardigan wrong ; she nearly locked her keys in the car in the yacht club parking lot . <p> And yet , once Claire and Lock were seated , overlooking the trim yacht club lawn and the blue harbor beyond , it was he who seemed nervous , worked up , agitated . He wiggled in his wrought iron chair ; he fussed over what Claire might order from the menu . ( " Get anything you want , " Lock said . " Get the lobster salad . Anything . " ) After their orders were placed and small talk was exhausted , there was a dramatic pause in the conversation , a making way , a throat clearing . Claire nearly laughed ; she felt like she was being proposed to . <p> Would she consider chairing the Nantucket 's Children Summer Gala the following August ? <p> Claire filled with relief . It felt like laughing gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the invisible thread had been snipped , cut : she was free from the awful weight that attended her connection with Lock Dixon . Was it okay , then , to imagine that the accusation she had seen in his eyes years earlier had been nothing more than a figment of her imagination ? <p> She was so caught up in wondering that she did n't respond . In truth , it would be fair to say she had n't even heard the question . It was like the time she fainted during track practice , when she was seventeen , and she became convinced that she was pregnant . She was dead certain ; she had Matthew ready to sell his guitar so they could pay for an abortion , but she cried herself to sleep , worried that she was going to burn in hell , and she decided to keep the baby . Her mother would raise it while Claire went to college ... <p> When Claire went to the doctor , he said , You 're not pregnant . The problem is that you have anemia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glee . <p> " Chairing ? " she said now . <p> " It 's a lot of work , but probably not as much as you think . You 'll have a cochair . I know you 're busy , but ... " <p> Yes , three children and a baby and a glassblowing business put on hold for the foreseeable future so she could focus on her family . She was not the right person to ask . Not this year . Maybe down the road , when she had her head above water . Then it dawned on Claire why he was asking her : The summer gala was a concert . Lock was coming to her because they wanted Matthew to perform . Max West , her high school sweetheart , now one of the biggest rock stars in the world . <p> Claire took in some of the rarefied yacht club air . There were a million thoughts zipping through her mind : Jason would kill her . Siobhan would laugh and call her a pushover ( No Boundaries ! ) . Margarita , no salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it if she asked ? She had n't spoken to him in years . He might , he just might . Anemia ! Nantucket 's Children was a good cause . The best cause . <p> Trumping all those thoughts was this : Lock Dixon was the one person Claire could not say no to . What had happened the night of Daphne 's accident hung in the air between them , unfinished business . It hung between them in a way that made Claire feel she owed Lock something . <p> " Yes , " Claire said . " I 'd love to . Really , I 'd be honored . " <p> Even though she had four children to raise ? Even though she had n't blown out so much as a single goblet since Zack was born ? <p> " Really ? " Lock said . He sounded surprised . <p> " Absolutely , " she said . <p> " Well , okay , then , " Lock said . He raised his sweating glass of iced tea , as did Claire , and they touched glasses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Jason was going to kill her . <p> They had been married for twelve years , together for fourteen . They had met here , on Nantucket , during the hottest summer on record . Jason had been born and raised on the island , he knew it inside out , and he took pride in sharing it with Claire . Each day was like a present : They went clamming naked at sunset on the south shore . They went skinny-dipping in the private swimming pools along Hulbert Avenue ( Jason knew which pools had security systems and which did n't ) . Theirs was , in every aspect , a summer romance . Claire had just graduated from RISD with a degree in glassblowing . She was torn between taking a job offer from Corning and teaming up with a traveling crafts fair and seeing the country . Jason had graduated from Northeastern with a degree in political science , which he declared useless . Four wasted years , he said of college , except for the beer and the proximity to Fenway , and the introduction to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only saying that to impress her ) . He wanted to live on Nantucket and build houses . <p> They were in love that summer , but what Claire remembered was how temporary it felt , how fragile , fleeting , ethereal . In truth , they barely knew each other . Claire told Jason about her years with Matthew-Max West , the Max West of " This Could Be a Song " - but Jason did n't believe her . Did n't believe her ! He did n't believe she could blow glass , either . She showed him her goblets and footed candy dishes ; he shook his head in wonder , but not in acknowledgment . <p> They sailed on Jason 's Hobie Cat , they fished for scup and stripers , they dove off the boat into the dark water , they had bonfires at Great Point and slept under the stars , they had sex with the wild abandon of two twenty-year-olds who had nothing to lose . They hung out with Jason 's brother , Carter , who was a chef at the Galley , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cork . Siobhan wore square glasses and had dark freckles across her pale nose , like pepper over mashed potatoes . Claire fell in love with Carter and Siobhan as well as Jason , and one night she was drunk and bold enough to say , " What if I do n't go to Corning after Labor Day ? What if I stay on Nantucket and marry Jason ? And Siobhan , you marry Carter , and we raise kids together and live happily ever after ? " <p> They had laughed at her , and Siobhan told her to piss off-but she , Claire Danner , had been right , and they were now , all of them , Crispins . Ten strong , including the kids . It was storybook-except that it was tough , frustrating , boring reality . Claire and Jason had gone from being two kids with no tan lines and sand in the cracks of their bums to being Mom and Dad , the heads of a minicorporation , the Crispin family of 22 Featherbed Lane . Jason had worked for Eli Drummond for years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house as well as the hot shop for Claire out back . Then Jason hired four Lithuanian guys and went out on his own . Claire cultivated five clients with erudite and expensive taste in art objects made of glass . She gave birth , in quick succession , to J.D. , Ottilie , and Shea . Claire worked erratic hours-after the kids went to bed , before they woke up . Then , when Shea hit preschool , Claire worked more . Everything was okay , fine , good at times , but there were bumps . Jason started smoking at work-smoking ! - and trying to hide it with beer or breath mints . Jason became resentful when Claire turned him down for sex . She tried to explain to him what it felt like to be pawed by three kids all day . She was their slave , their employee ; she worked for them . Was it any wonder that when the end of the day came , she wanted to be left alone ? Jason had never been intellectually curious ( after that first summer , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over time he became incorrigibly sucked into the television . Claire found the TV maddening-the channel surfing , the sports . Jason drove a pickup that was as huge and black as a hearse , a gasguzzler he affectionately called Darth Vader . Darth Vader ? Claire said , incredulous that she had married a man who treated his truck like a fraternity brother or a pet . The kids like it , Jason said . The truck , the love affair with the tube , the sneaked cigarettes , and the early morning breakfasts at the Downyflake so that Jason could touch base with his subs and hear about new business-all of it served to push Claire to the brink . <p> But there were also many wonderful things about Jason . He worked hard and provided for his family . He prided himself on being simple and straightforward , honest and true ; he was the right angle of a T square , the bubble in the level , always locating the center . What you see is what you get . He adored the kids . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with projects around the house : rolling paint onto walls , turning the screwdriver while sucking intently on his bottom lip . I 'm Dad 's wingman . They built a go-cart using an old lawn mower engine ; they went scalloping together and pulled cherrystone clams out of the wet , marshy sand with a tool Jason had fashioned from a piece of PVC pipe . You 'll never go hungry with the Crispin men around ! Jason was exemplary with the girls , too-father of the year . He delivered Ottilie and Shea to dance lessons , he bought them bouquets on the day of their dance recital , and he whistled louder than anyone else in the audience . He tirelessly explained that Ottilie was an old-fashioned French name . We wanted something unique , he said , beaming with pride . <p> When Claire got pregnant with Zack , things were going smoothly . She was working on a huge commission for her best client , Chick Klaussen : a sculpture for the entry of his offices on West Fifty-fourth Street in Manhattan . She planned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due . Jason was happy because he was , deep in his soul , a procreator . He would have had ten kids if Claire was willing , a stable of kids , a posse , a football team , a tribe : the Crispin clan . <p> When Claire was thirty-two weeks along , she was in the hot shop working on the Klaussen commission . She had a week or two of work left at the most . At the most ! she promised Jason , even though her doctor wanted her to stop . Too hot in there , he said . Not safe for you or the baby . Claire was working very hot , it was finish work , shine and polish , she was not drinking enough water , and she fainted . She hit the floor , cut her arm , broke two ribs , and went immediately into preterm labor . On the MedFlight jet , they told her she would most likely lose the baby . But Zack had lived ; they took him by emergency C-section , and he spent five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Claire healed . <p> Jason was shaken to his core . He had been standing there as they sliced Claire open-Claire , whose body had sucked in two bags of IV fluid in less than thirty minutes , so advanced was her dehydration-and he had fully expected them to pull out a stillborn . But then , the cry . It was a revelation for Jason ; it was his bornagain moment , the moment when an adult man who thought he knew everything learned something about the human condition . He sat next to Claire 's bed as Zack spent the first of thirty-five days in the NICU , and he made Claire promise she would stop working . <p> For a little while , he said . Have a studio finish the Klaussen commission . <p> This was as close as he came to blaming her . But no matter-Claire blamed herself , as she had blamed herself for Daphne 's accident . Her blood type was the rare AB positive : the universal acceptor . And that was all too fitting . Give her the blame , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boundaries , she would take it on . She agreed to stop working ; she gave the Klaussen commission to a glass studio in Brooklyn to finish . <p> Zack captured Jason 's heart-and Claire 's heart , too-because they came so close to losing him . Even now , seven months later , Claire woke up in the middle of the night , worrying about the lasting effects of her fall . She watched Zack , willing him to respond to her in an age-appropriate way , wishing that his eyes would show that glimmer , that promise that her other kids had shown : intelligence , motivation , determination . Since Zack 's birth , she had lived with the whisper , There 's something wrong with him . She constantly badgered Jason : Do you think something happened when he was born ? Do you think there 's something Dr. Patel is n't telling me , or something she did n't see ? To which Jason always responded , " For Chrissakes , Claire , he 's fine ! " But that sounded to Claire like denial . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How was she going to tell Jason about the gala ? Claire waited through dinner-fried chicken , Jason 's favorite . She waited through bath and stories for the girls and a shower and homework for J.D. She waited until Zack had his bottle , until Jason was relaxed on the sofa , remote control in hand . The TV was on , but Jason had not committed to anything yet . Now was the time to tell him ! This was their life now , but Claire could remember Jason naked and grinning with a clam rake in his hand , his sun-bleached hair shining like gold . <p> " I had lunch with Lock Dixon today , " she said . " At the yacht club . " <p> He heard her , but he was n't listening . " Did you ? " <p> " Does n't that surprise you ? " <p> Jason changed the channel . Claire resented the TV , all fifty-two bright , chirping inches of it . " A little , I guess . " <p> " He asked me to cochair the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " You know , the Nantucket 's Children thing . The event . The concert . The thing we went to last month . " <p> At this past year 's gala , while Jason lingered at the back bar with his fishing buddies , Claire had applauded as the two cochairs floated up onto the stage to accept bouquets of flowers . As if they had been named prom queen . As if they had won an Academy Award . Claire had been caught up in the glamour of it all . The mere fact that she had sat down for a civilized lunch at the yacht club made Claire believe that if she agreed to cochair the summer gala for Nantucket 's Children , her life would be more like that and less like it was now . Claire never ate lunches like the one she had had today . Lunch for her was a sleeve of saltines that she kept in the console of her Honda Pilot and stuffed blindly into her mouth as she picked the kids up from school . If she was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poured at eleven thirty ( it was breakfast and lunch ) , which grew soggy before Claire finished it because the baby cried , or the phone rang , or the crumbs under her feet pushed her past her already-high threshold for filth and yuck and she capitulated and pulled out the vacuum . If Claire agreed to cochair the gala , her life might take on a distinguished quality , the golden glow that accompanied a life devoted to good works . How could she explain this to Jason ? <p> " He asked you to chair it ? " <p> " Cochair it . I 'd have help . " <p> " I hope you said no . " <p> She stroked Zack 's soft head . " I said yes . " <p> " Jesus , Claire . " <p> Was it so wrong ? She and Jason had spent the past seven months living in reverence of their own good fortune . Was n't it time now to think of others ? To raise money for kids whose parents were working themselves sick with three jobs ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> Jason huffed , turned the volume up . And that , she supposed , was the best she could hope for . <p> " You 're a complete idiot , Clairsy . A bloody fool . " <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
