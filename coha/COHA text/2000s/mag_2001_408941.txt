Section : Win the Fat War Prevention 's Shape-Up Contest winner , Alexis Roberts , lost 63 lb As told to Sarah Robertson <p> I could n't believe my luck . Out of thousands of entries , Prevention chose me to receive my own personal trainer and dietitian for 6 months . With that kind of support , I knew I could lose weight for good . <p> I had been on one diet or another practically my entire life . But caring for my sick mother , raising twin daughters on my own , and working rotating shifts made it difficult to stay committed . I 'd always go back to eating hefty portions of the same fattening meals : sausage , eggs , grits , and biscuits for breakfast ; a beef entree , stuffed shells loaded with cheese , and dessert at lunchtime ; something similar for dinner ; and pastries and candy bars in between . Things did n't get any easier when I went back to school . <p> When Prevention called , I was tipping the scale at 263 lb . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taught me how to make quick and easy meals that my girls would eat . We toured my local grocery store , where Catherine pointed out healthy packaged products such as soy hot dogs and soy burger crumbles for making tacos , spaghetti sauce , and sloppy joes . The soy products are lower in fat than most meats , they taste great , and having some protein at every meal helped keep my blood sugar on an even keel , so I was n't hungry between meals . Catherine also encouraged me to eat at least five fruits and vegetables a day , to increase my fiber intake with whole grain cereals and beans , and to drink more water . <p> Surprisingly , I found out that I was reading food labels incorrectly . Instead of counting total calories , I was counting fat calories only . So I was actually eating more calories than I thought . <p> With Catherine 's help and input from my daughters , I created 4 weeks ' worth of dinner menus that we rotated through each month . Planning and shopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and time-saver , and since my girls like the food , I only had to cook one meal . Exercise Helps More Than Your Body <p> If it were n't for Colleen Edgerton , certified personal trainer and fitness instructor , I never would have kept up my grades in college . During my toughest semester , I applied the same focus to my schoolwork that I had learned while exercising with Colleen . Bit by bit , my study habits improved , and I graduated with honors last year . <p> Colleen and I would meet from 5 to 6 am on Mondays , Wednesdays , and Fridays for a power walk through my neighborhood . Along the way , we did lunges , squats , push-ups , an upper-body workout with exercise bands , and stretches . I 'd also exercise an additional 2 or 3 days a week on my own . For variety , we went kayaking some weekends too . Keeping Off the Pounds <p> When the 6 months ended , I had trimmed down to 215 lb . But I was worried that I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To stay on track , I recruited a coworker to be my lunchtime walking partner , and I started playing softball on my company 's team . I still walk 4 mornings a week ( now with a neighbor ) , and I play tennis , hike , and canoe on weekends . But it does n't stop there . I climb stairs during work breaks . I park about 10 minutes away from my office and walk the remaining distance . And my computer has been programmed to remind me to drink water regularly . Not only have I maintained my weight loss , but I 've dropped an additional 15 lb . <p> It feels terrific that I 'm being a healthy role model for my girls , and I 'm really excited about the future . <p> My high school sweetheart , whom I have n't seen in years , is coming for a visit soon . Just wait until he meets the new me ! Exercise Tips from a Trainer <p> Colleen Edgerton , Alexis 's coach , offers suggestions for a rewarding workout . Timing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her busy days from interfering with her workouts . You do n't need a gym membership . Alexis started with a new pair of walking shoes , exercise bands , and the hills , curbs , and park benches in her neighborhood . Find your turn-ons . Alexis loved using a heart-rate monitor , because it gave her a goal to work toward during every session .
