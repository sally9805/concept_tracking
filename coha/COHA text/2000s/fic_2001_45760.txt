IN THE END , THE KEY TO time travel was provided by Lawrence Welk . <p> It happened in the vicinity of Peapack , New Jersey . One evening during February sweeps , all the television sets that still had antennas started emitting accordion music and grainy black-and-white champagne bubbles . It lasted only a few minutes , but viewers of The World 's Most Gruesome Accidents flooded the station with complaints . <p> Pranksters was the first theory . But videotapes of the event deepened the mystery . It had been a live broadcast from the 1960s , and no tape of it was known to exist . Attempts to pinpoint the source of the signal failed until the Defense Department reported that one of its satellites had also picked up the bubbly broadcast . It had come from outer space . <p> Aliens was everyone 's second thought . Green men had picked up our planet 's electromagnetic ambassador and , in a mortifying commentary on Earthling musical taste , returned him to sender . But when the scientists at Princeton turned their attention to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they found no planets teeming with music critics . Instead , they found evidence of the closest black hole yet discovered . <p> They announced what had happened in a packed press conference where none of the computer graphics worked , and the physicists resorted to scribbling diagrams on pads of paper . The television signal , launched in the 1960s , had traveled outward into space for twenty or twenty-five years before encountering the black hole . There , unimaginable gravity had bent a portion of the signal around in a U and slingshotted it back , focused and amplified in the weird electromagnetic environs of the singularity . Peapack had had the honor of passing through the returning beam . If future viewers picked up reprises of Bonanza or Mister Ed , no one should be alarmed . <p> What happened next was more secretive . <p> It had occurred to the scientists almost at once that it would be possible to use the black hole to send a message to the future . What very few of them knew was that in a secret research institute outside Boulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of space travel . With a particle beam , they disassembled an object , recording its molecular structure . That information , encoded into a beam of clarified light , was sent to a receiver that reassembled the object in its exact original configuration . They had started by sending gumwads and bottle caps across the laboratory , and graduated to begonias and rabbits . There had been a few messy slip-ups , but we wo n't go into that . <p> The drawback of this system for space travel was that you needed a receiver at the other end before sending anything through . It would be necessary to ferry receivers out to the stars by slow , conventional means . But with a handy black hole to boomerang the message back , sending someone to the future was a real possibility . <p> " Do n't worry , we 'll leave a note on the refrigerator , " the scientists joked to their volunteer time traveler , when she raised the point that someone in the future would have to be expecting the message . <p> What else could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volunteer 's name was Sage Akwesasne , and she stood out in the army of balding math nerds - not only because she was as tall and lean as the Iroquois hunters of her ancestry , but because she was a person who took in much and said little . Not even she could have explained why she had volunteered for such a hazardous experiment . It certainly was n't deep trust in the reliability of scientists . She was a newly minted postdoc in an era with few job prospects , but that was n't it , either . There was just something about the idea of flaming across the parsecs as a beam of pure information that appealed to her . <p> No one consulted OSHA , or got a permit for black-hole travel . They just did it . <p> THE FIRST THING that came to Sage 's mind , after the electric shock that re-started her heart , was surprise that it had worked . She was lying on a polished steel surface , covered with a thin hospital blanket . Experimentally , she wiggled her fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right configuration . <p> An elderly man with a large pocked nose and wild gray hair leaned over her . A doctor , she thought , concerned for her health . " Sage , " he whispered urgently , " do n't sign anything . " <p> Whatever happened to " How do you feel ? " Perplexed , she sat up , clutching the blanket . After a moment of vertigo , she saw that she was in precisely the kind of place she had expected : a laboratory full of enigmatic devices . She looked back at the assembler machine that had just reconstituted her . It looked bigger and more well-funded than the one they had had in her time . " What year is it ? " she asked . <p> The man gave a sheepish , tentative smile . There was something familiar about him . " Five years later than you were expecting . I 'm James Nickle , by the way . Oh , here . " He remembered to hand her a bathrobe he was carrying . <p> " Jamie , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't recognized him . He had been a graduate intern on the project . Then , he had been a peculiar-looking young man with a large pocked nose and wild brown hair . <p> " You came in on time , just as we planned , " he explained as she pulled on the bathrobe . " But you 've been on disk for a while . " <p> " On disk ? " she said blankly . <p> " Yes , because of the court case . You were impounded until they figured out who owned your copyright . " <p> " My copyright . " <p> There was a discreet cough , and Sage realized that another man had entered the room . This one was small and sleek as a ferret , dark-skinned and bearded . Something about his immaculate cuffs and narrow lapels said " lawyer . " With a restrained manner he came forward and said , " I am Mr. Ramesh jabhwalla . I represent the Metameme Corporation . I regret to have to inform you that you are not Sage Akwesasne . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Legally , you are a replica produced through a patented process , using proprietary information owned by the Metameme Corporation . It is our contention that your copyright resides in us . " <p> Sage was n't sure she was getting this straight . " You mean , you 've copyrighted my story . " <p> " No , " said Mr. jabhwalla . " You . " He opened his brief case and showed her a large data disk with a stylized MM logo on it . " The code that was used to create you . " <p> " You 're crazy , " Sage said . " You ca n't copyright a person . " <p> Behind Mr. jabhwalla 's back , Jamie was nodding vigorously . But the lawyer was unperturbed . " They patented the human genome , " he said . " That was the legal precedent . There is no substantive difference between the biochemical code to create a human and electromagnetic code to do the same . " <p> Jamie said apologetically , " It 's why this technology has never taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's head was spinning . <p> Impeccably polite , Mr. Jabhwalla said , " However , Metameme has recently decided not to continue pursuing the case . The copyright question will remain moot . Instead - " he fished a thick , blue-covered contract out of the briefcase and presented it to her- " we are offering you a contract with our wholly owned subsidiary , PersonaFires . They will market your persona for a very reasonable twenty percent commission , plus expenses . It 's a good deal , Ms. Akwesasne-dupe . Most people would kill for a PersonaFires contract . Sign here . " He offered her a polished wood fountain pen . <p> No doubt the twenty-four dollars ' worth of beads for Manhattan had seemed like a good deal at the time . " And if I tell you to get lost ? " she asked . <p> " Then , who knows ? We might be forced to create a more agreeable duplicate of you . " <p> " You ca n't do that ! " <p> " Ca n't we ? " Smiling pleasantly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Then I guess I have to think about it . " <p> He hesitated , but seemed to sense Jamie scowling over his shoulder . <p> " Very well , " he said , and pocketed the pen . " Till then , allow us to be your host in the twenty-first century . " <p> She got down off the assembler slab , ignoring Jabhwalla 's offered hand . Standing in bare feet , she was six inches taller than he . Jamie ushered her into a bathroom where there hung a many-pocketed jumpsuit that made her look like an African explorer when she put it on . She examined herself in the mirror , wondering if her nose had really been so long before . <p> Mr. Jabhwalla was waiting when she emerged . He led the way to a door , but paused before opening it . " I 'm afraid the press knows about you , " he said . <p> The next room was packed with reporters . When she entered , the sound of cameras going off was like a bushful of crickets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sage ! Sagie ! Honey , look over here ! Have you signed with Metameme ? What do you think of the future ? How does it feel to be so many years out of date ? " <p> Three people crowded forward to shove endorsement contracts at her , talking fast about tie-ins and face time and profit exposure . Others tucked business cards into her pockets . In seconds , the room was a muddle of elbows and frenzy . Then Sage saw Mr. Jabhwalla 's hand wave , and two bodyguards in suits with Metameme logos waded in on either side of her , clearing a path to the door . <p> They came out into an airy , high-ceilinged lobby , pursued by cameras and action . The bodyguards were hustling Sage along so fast she barely had time for a glimpse . " Where are we going ? " she said . <p> Mr. Jabhwalla answered , " I am taking you to meet the most powerful man in the world . " <p> " The President ? " Sage said , astonished . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to meet him ? " He glanced at one of the bodyguards . " Hans , who is president , anyway ? " <p> " Do n't know yet , " Hans answered . " The election is day after tomorrow . " <p> " Oh , of course . Well , that has to wait . Today you are going to meet D.B. Beddoes , Chairman of Metameme . " <p> Glass doors drew back before them . At the curb waited a white limo equipped with approximately half a block of tinted glass . One bodyguard opened a door ; the other propelled her inside . She was thrown back against soft leather as the car took off . <p> The dark inside of the limo looked like an electronics store , screens everywhere . An out-of-shape , rather pasty blond man in wire-rimmed glasses was seated in a swiveling recliner , viewing a recording of Sage getting into the limo . He was wearing a baggy sweater , jeans , and bedroom slippers . He scrolled the picture back to the point when Sage entered the roomful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leg restlessly . " That went well , do n't you think ? " he said . <p> Mr. Jabhwalla had been flung into a seat opposite her , but he was not the one who answered . Instead , a young woman whose skin was startlingly dyed in gold and black tiger stripes said , " Right on script . " She leaned forward to offer a friendly hand to Sage . " I 'm Patty Wickwire , President of PersonaFires . We 're an image marketing company . " <p> " I 've heard of it , " Sage said . <p> " Yes , I know . " <p> Patty looked too young to have a job , much less be company president . She was wearing a leather vest and tiny shorts that showed off her picturesque skin . Her hair was piled on her head in a teased and tousled whirlwind . Little objects were caught in the cyclone of hair : a cigarette , a tiny working television screen , a miniature Statue of Liberty . Sage thought she detected irony in the choices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself for replication , " Patty said , directing Sage 's attention to a screen at her side . " I 've already weeded the bad ones . Press ' Accept ' to send them out to auction . " <p> The photos had been taken moments before . They were unrealistically flattering , as if they had been doctored . " They must have taken three hundred photos of me , " Sage said . <p> " They can take them , but they ca n't replicate them without paying a royalty , " Patty explained . " Every image is proprietary . Laws have improved since your time . All you need is someone to enforce them for you . " <p> Sage pressed " Accept " to see what would happen . Across the car the doughboy was talking on a wire headset . He said , " The photo 's going on the block right now , number 47 . See it ? No , do n't buy it , you dipstick , we want it in Elite or Hip . That 's the fashion image we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air of savage , myopic concentration he studied a screen in front of him . " Damn ! It went to Fox . Okay , change of plan . Replicate her jumpsuit in denim , under fifty bucks . Flood the Bargain Bays . Can you do that by tomorrow ? Good man . " He poked the screen and it switched to a complicated 3D chart . " Hot damn , will you look at that ! Her penetration 's close to 80 , and it 's been logarithmic since 40 . Her contagion index is off the charts . She 's taking over the bandwidth like smallpox . " <p> " You 're a genius , D.B. , " Patty said in a tone that implied he already knew . <p> He checked another screen . " Endorsement bids are rolling in nicely . Disney and ATW are duking it out for rights to the action figures , the biopic , and the immersion game . The plastic surgeons are waiting for the specs on her face . " He peered through wispy bangs at Sage . " Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth . " A terminal beeped . He turned to it . " The photos sure went fast . Congratulations , Ms. Akwesasne . You just made your first $30,000 . " <p> " That was easy , " Sage said . <p> His face lost all semblance of softness . With a cold intensity he said , " No , it was n't . You have no idea how hard it was to set up the system that just made you all that money . " <p> Sage focused on him more clearly . No one had introduced him , presumably because he needed no introduction . It occurred to her that this was no man to trifle with . His puppy-dog looks hid a carbon-fiber personality . <p> " Why are you selling the specs on my face ? " she asked . <p> " That 's the business we 're in , Ms. Akwesasne . Sorry , I thought Jabhwalla filled you in . Metameme is an information wholesaler . We do n't usually do end-product consumer delivery ; there are lots of companies in place for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to publishers , manufacturers , media outlets , and other businesses . " <p> " An information middleman , " Sage said . <p> " Right . " A terminal was warbling ; he swiveled around and touched the screen . " Hi , Steve . What 's up ? " He listened for a moment . " No , she 's from turn of the millennium . Golden age of innocence , remember ? Mass markets . Marriage . Internal combustion . When they thought jaded hackers would hippify the world . If you 're interested , I 've got a whole line of classic revival concepts posted for bid . Use access code ' Nostalgiapunk . ' " He jabbed the screen off . " Sheesh , how do these people stay in business , so far behind the curve ? " <p> " You 're selling information about me ? " Sage said . <p> " Brokering it for you . Do n't worry , you 're getting royalties . You 're very lucky you landed with us . We 're the best as well as the biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property , you could go exponential . " <p> " Wait a minute , " Sage said . " What if I do n't want to be a celebrity ? " <p> D.B. , Patty , and Jabhwalla all stared at her as if the words " do n't want to be a celebrity " were n't in English . D.B. was first to recover . " It does n't matter , " he said , leaning forward , suddenly intent and earnest . " In a way , this is n't about you at all . It 's about the idea of you , and that transcends all of us . You answer a yearning in the culture . Our world is hungry for heroes . The brave woman who gave up her life to become a beam of light , and traveled around a black hole to come back to us - it 's Promethean , it 's Orphic , it hits us at this limbic level . You are a heavenly messenger . And if you do n't pull it off with style , you 'll disillusion a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe the way kids believe . You 've come to redeem us from our cynicism , and I ca n't let you let us down . " <p> Everything but the flicker of screens was frozen for a moment after he stopped speaking . Then D.B. shook his head , as if emerging from some kind of fugue state , and turned to Patty . " Did you get that ? " <p> " Yup , " she said , holding up a recorder . <p> " Put it in a marketing plan or something , " he said . <p> For a moment there , he 'd practically sold Sage to herself . With a pang of disappointment , she forced herself to be skeptical . " Then why did you keep me on disk for five years ? " <p> D.B. blinked as if the question had ambushed him , but he only lost one beat . " Five years ago we were n't ready for you , " he said . " You would have gotten your fifteen minutes , and that would 've been it . Today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't just mean popular , I mean dominant paradigm . " He turned to Patty . " What is your marketing plan on her , anyway ? " <p> Patty bit her lip . " Actually , D.B. , I need to run it past you . " <p> " Of course , " he said . <p> " No , I mean , it 's a little bit novel . " <p> " Novel 's good . " <p> " Let 's talk about it when we get to the house . " <p> " Yes ! What the fuck is it ? " he snarled at the air . For a moment Sage thought he was having a psychotic episode ; then she realized a call had come in on his headset . <p> The video screen at the front of the car showed the road ahead . They were entering a one-lane tunnel . Ahead , a steel gate rolled up to let them through . They passed a manned checkpoint , then rolled to a stop next to a set of elevators . The car windows went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Jabhwalla got out and held the door for Sage , the perfect gentleman . Meanwhile , D.B. had gotten absorbed in a densely detailed discussion with his caller . He gestured them on , never glancing from his terminal . <p> As they waited for the elevator , Patty said in a low voice to Mr. Jabhwalla , " Maybe you better stay with the Idea Machine , in case he has another inspiration spasm . I 'll take Sage up . " <p> Mr. Jabhwalla nodded . Patty and Sage got on the elevator . Patty 's stripes undulated when she moved . <p> " So , what do you think of D.B. ? " Patty said when they were alone . Sage shrugged . " Nothing wrong with him a little Ritalin would n't fix . " <p> Patty laughed nervously . " He 's my client , too , you know . I 've been trying to get him to ditch that geek-boy persona . It was useful at first ; everyone bought into him as eccentric genius mogul . But it 's gotten old . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's just who he is , " Sage suggested . <p> Patty shook her head . " He is who he needs to be to run Metameme . It 's not an insurgent startup anymore . He 's a public figure now , and this is n't the twentieth century . " <p> After a long ride , the elevator doors opened onto an airy entry hall . The front wall was glass , three stories high , and looked out on a dramatic mountainscape . They were at a high elevation ; patches of snow lingered in shadowed spots , and a bank of clouds hid the lowlands below . The room had been built around three old-growth white pines that soared up to the skylight roof . At their base , a Japanese fountain played in the sunlight . <p> " I thought you might feel at home in the millennium suite , " Patty said . " I 'll show you now , while we have some time . " She led the way up a sweeping cedar and slate staircase to a landing adorned in Tlingit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The decor of the millennium suite turned out to be late- 1990s luxury hotel , teal and beige . The only inauthentic touch was that video screens were everywhere - in the ceiling above the bed , in the surface of the dining table , in the wall opposite the toilet , behind the bathroom mirror - not to mention the six-foot-square one that filled an entire wall . " You have access to all the major infoservices here , " Patty said proudly , as if Sage was supposed to be impressed . <p> " Who normally lives here ? " Sage asked , feeling the pampered anonymity of the room . <p> " Well , this is D.B. 's house , but he only uses a couple rooms . The rest are for business guests . " <p> " So , no patter of little feet ? " <p> " Children ? God , not Where would those come from ? " She made it sound inconceivable . <p> Sage sat on the bed , cross-legged . " So I guess the information trade pays off ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sitting next to her . " It 's like he channels the Zeitgeist or something . He was first to use memetics in the infobiz . Did they know what memes were in your time ? " <p> " There was a theory . Memes were supposed to be units of information like ideas , tunes , fads , rumors - that supposedly replicated themselves through the population the same way new genes spread . The idea was that people caught memes like viruses , and spread them to others . There was speculation that you could come up with an epidemiology of knowledge . No one had ever done it , though . " <p> " Well , D.B. did it , or something close . He figured out the algorithms to model the spread of memes on the net . It was like cultural weather prediction . He could forecast what kinds of information were going to , be in demand , and then he 'd go and sew up the market before anyone knew what he was up to . He made his first killing when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to go nonlinear . He borrowed fifty million dollars and bought up rights to a whole pile of university test results . Pretty soon the world was clamoring to know the food chain was safe , and the bioag companies did n't know whether he was holding positive or negative results . They paid top dollar to buy back control of the info . " <p> " But - that 's blackmail , " Sage protested . <p> Patty shrugged . " So ? Times change . Usury used to be illegal ; now we call it interest . Anyway , Metameme expanded into information supply . Tracking trends is still its bread and butter . But D.B. 's moved on . Today , he 's more interested in memetic engineering - creating and propagating memes deliberately . " <p> " You mean starting fads , so he can be ready with the merchandise ? " <p> " It 's not as easy as it sounds . If anyone really knew the formula for a successful meme , he 'd have made a billion billion by now . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office when she was ready , Patty left . Alone , Sage went into the bathroom , thinking of taking a shower , but found that the shower stall had no spigot , and was lined with fat glass tubes . Cryptic safety instructions on the door led her to stand in the stall , arms raised and eyes closed . There was a flash of light , a puff of air , and she stepped out again , clean down to the roots of her hair . It was an enormously pleasant discovery . All the time and labor wasted on personal hygiene would be miraculously restored to her day . She understood now how Patty could maintain the elaborate hairdo - it could stay in place for a month without growing dirty . <p> Considerably refreshed , she looked into her closet . It was full of clothes , all her size , but she did not trust herself to assemble any of it appropriately , so she stayed with her jumpsuit . Lying back on the bed , she decided to turn on the ceiling monitor , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bedside stand . Experimentally , she pointed it at the screen , and the terminal flashed on , presenting her with a menu . She discovered she could use the pointer to make selections . <p> Quickly she navigated to a news service and found she was the headline news , completely eclipsing the coming election . She surfed from site to site , seeing the same photos and video clips she had approved for sale , but given a variety of spins . To her surprise , not a single one was complimentary to Metameme or D.B. Beddoes . <p> He was described as everything from " secretive infomagnate " to " indicted monopolist " to " evil genius . " Paging to a background piece , she learned that the court battle over her copyright had been brutal to Metameme 's image , and only in the last few days had it become clear that the company was going to lose . Then , without warning , Metameme had abruptly reversed position and substantiated her without consulting anyone . The uproar now was about why she had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evil genius had in mind . A senator spoke threateningly about human rights violations . <p> She , on the other hand , seemed quite popular - the broadcasts dwelt lovingly on beauty-enhanced photos of her mysterious appearance before the reporters , her gawk transformed to glamor . With some ambivalence , she realized there was already a duplicate Sage Akwesasne in the noosphere - an image passed from brain to brain , growing more vivid at every step - chic , magnetic , untamed . It was no one 's creation , and everyone 's ; but no one else had such power to alter it , or be it . <p> Sage flicked off the screen and lay musing . The twenty-first century was a forest primeval , it seemed ; but she was more than just wolf bait . She had hunter instincts herself , honed in the Darwinian jungles of Cambridge , Massachusetts . She was a match for this world . <p> The hallways of D.B. 's house were sepulchrally silent . Sage was tempted to explore , but put it off . She needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directions led her past the pine tree room , down a hall , and through a security door that opened to her thumbprint . A camera swiveled to watch her cross the foyer . <p> D.B. was alone in his office  --  except for the virtual presence of several harried employees on a double bank of monitors that served him for a desk . He was pacing up and down in stockinged feet , talking on his headset and brandishing one of his bedroom slippers . The other one was lodged on a tall bookshelf where he had apparently flung it . There was a half-eaten peanut butter sandwich and a Coke abandoned next to an unplugged keyboard . <p> " Am I surrounded by morons ? " he was saying . " Have n't you ever heard of schadenfreude ? " Seeing Sage at the door , he beckoned her in and pointed his slipper at a chair . She sat . " Yeah , schadenfreude . The feeling of pleasure at someone else 's misfortune . Public figures get a popularity boost whenever something bad happens to them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least , that 's the theory . Give it a chance , okay ? " He thumbed the touchscreen off and slumped into a leather office chair . " My own PR department thinks I 'm nuts . " <p> Sage said , " Well , you are getting pretty badly beat up on the net . " <p> He swiveled to face her , staring intently through round lenses . " Have I violated your civil rights ? " <p> " I do n't know , " she said . " Have you ? " <p> He did n't answer , just drummed his fingers on the arms of his chair . He seemed incapable of sitting still . <p> " So you sell information , " she said . <p> " Yeah , " he said , still drumming , preoccupied . " Engine of the economy . " <p> " In my day we thought information ought to be free and available to all . " <p> " Well , that 's how capitalism expands , by commodifying what people find valuable . The Native Americans thought you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they now ? " He focused on her suddenly and said , " Oh , sorry . I forgot about your ethnic identity . That 's amazing hair you 've got , by the way . " <p> " It comes with the ethnicity , " Sage said tolerantly . <p> " I figured . Makes for great graphics . " <p> Patiently , Sage steered the conversation back to him . " There 's got to be a lot of perfectly worthless information out there . How do you know what 's valuable ? " <p> A flash of boyish animation came across his face . " That 's the question ! That 's the whole question . On one level , it 's the same as any other commodity : what 's scarce is valuable , what 's abundant is not . When I first got into the business , no one had any control over supply , or any way of forecasting demand . " <p> " How can you get control over the supply of information ? " Sage tried not to let on how sinister she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of information workers , " D.B. said . " That 's how a lot of companies went broke : they weighed themselves down with payroll . I put my money on entrepreneurship . I offered global brokering for knowledge workers - engineers , image designers , researchers , programmers , composers , graphic artists , scriptwriters . Anyone with a viable product could come to us , and we 'd package it , find a buyer , and get them top price . God , it took off . Pretty soon all the content providers were going independent to get out from under the stale old corporate work models , and I was everyone 's best and biggest market . Companies started economizing by laying off their information producers , because they could buy ideas better and cheaper from me . " <p> For a moment , he looked nostalgic for old times . Then he snapped into focus again . " But the real question is still your first one : what information is valuable ? Obviously , I 'm not out to buy all of it , only what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away trade secrets , there 's a nearinsatiable demand for certain kinds of information ; you can always sell more . Other kinds do n't repay the cost of production . To oversimplify , it 's governed by the Urge Pyramid . At the broad base of what people want are the primal urges : fear , sex , hunger , aggression , and so on . Only after those are satiated do people want to be stimulated by beauty , novelty , sentiment , and the other mid-level urges . And at the tiny tip of the pyramid is desire for rational thought ; it 's the last thing people want . Information is nutrition for the brain , same as food . We 've got to have it , roughly in the proportions of the pyramid . " <p> " Your view of human nature is way cynical , " Sage said . <p> His reaction was abrupt and angry . " I 've made a couple hundred billion based on my assumptions . What 's your proof ? " <p> She did n't react , and as quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He started wandering around the room , his hands in his pockets , talking . " The way not to do an information-delivery system is top-down . You ca n't give people whatyou think they ought to have , you have to give them what they ask for . Elitist distribution systems get all caught up in accuracy and ethics , quality and high culture . Like ballet on television , for Gripes sake , and not wrestling . It 's not just unprofitable , it 's undemocratic . " <p> " Wait a second , " Sage objected . " A democracy depends on a wellinformed populace , citizens who know the issues . How can people have a sense of investment in society if they 're flooded with urge-fulfillment programming , and not quality information ? " <p> " Spoken like a true elitist , " D.B. said . " You want to dictate to the populace instead of trusting them to demand what they need . Democracy is all about giving people what they want . That 's why the free market is the most democratic institution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of accuracy and ethics ? " Sage said . <p> " Oh , accurate , ethical information is still out there , " D.B. said . " It 's just expensive . " To her astonished stare he said defensively , " Well , it costs money to get the story right , and there 's less demand for it . Wonks ought to pay a premium . " <p> " But that means - " <p> " Listen , " he interrupted , " I do n't just have populism on my side , I 've got natural law , too . Free markets operate according to the same underlying principles as ecosystems . The driving forces in both cases are competition and natural selection . Innovations are constantly getting injected into the system , and competition sorts out the ones that are viable . Or innovators form coalitions that are more viable in symbiosis - and then the other organisms call you a monopolist and take you to court . " For a moment his voice grew bitter . <p> " Never mind , this is the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competing for habitat space in our brains , and the successful ones are the ones that are most contagious . You know what makes a successful meme ? " <p> " Uh ... a true one ? " Sage said . <p> " Wrong ! Could n't be wronger . A successful meme is one that tweaks its host 's urge pyramid , and makes him want to pass it on . True memes are actually at a competitive disadvantage . You know why ? Because , oddly enough , the world does n't work in a memorable or interesting way . That 's why fiction is so much more satisfying than truth : it caters to our brains , and what they want . Reality needs to be productized in order to be convincing . " <p> One of D.B. 's terminals was buzzing urgently ; he thumbed it on . A brightlooking young man appeared , clearly nervous at speaking to the boss . " D.B. , I think I may have a solution for us . " He saw Sage , and froze , staring . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You know there 's a war in central Asia . " <p> " There 's always a war in central Asia . " <p> " Well , we 've got atrocity reports coming out now . Refugees . I thought we could push them really hard . " <p> " As a distraction ? " D.B. said , incredulous . " Oh , right . Like no one 's ever thought of that before . Sheesh . Give ' em some credit . " <p> The young man looked crestfallen . " Oh . Well then , what should we do with this war ? " <p> " We 've marketed three wars in the last six months , " D.B. said , pushing his glasses up his nose . " Their sponsorship potential 's crap . " <p> " Oh , we 've got some insurance companies and HMOs interested . We can make it a brand-name product . " <p> " Well , run the projections , then . I think the mass markets are saturated with refugees ; it 's become a cliche . " He pondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pretend you 're trying to downplay it . The egghead outlets will think we 're trying to suppress something , and they 'll jump all over it . They 're total suckers for suppression . " <p> " But then we 'll become the story , " the young man protested . <p> " So ? You will have sold your war . " <p> " Well .. okay . " The screen went dark . <p> D.B. turned back to Sage . She said , " How can war become a cliche ? A cliche is rhetorical ; war is real . " <p> He shrugged . " We do n't lead . We are led . " <p> " Oh good , I 've found you , " Patty said , standing striped and windblown in the doorway . A flash of irritation at the interruption crossed D.B. 's face , but he snagged a loose chair and rolled it over the carpet toward her . As she sat , she looked hintingly from her boss to Sage and said , " D.B. , have you ... ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Sage . " I forgot , I was supposed to be suborning you with lucre . Well , I 'm sure you picked up the subliminals . " He gestured at the rest of the house . " This could be yours , and so on . " <p> " D.B. ! " Patty protested , annoyed at him . " That 's - " <p> " That was charming , " Sage said . " I 'm touched . " <p> " Touched enough to sign a contract ? " D.B. said , suddenly purposeful as a nail gun . <p> " No . " <p> " Oh , well . Tell jabhwalla I tried . " He turned to Patty . " So what was this marketing plan of yours ? " <p> Patty shifted nervously in her chair , looking about fifteen . " D.B. , you 've got to promise not to get mad when I say this . " <p> " What are you talking about ? " he said . " I never get mad . " Sage laughed out loud " Sorry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right , this is my idea , " Patty began . <p> D.B. had settled in his chair ; now he sprang up again . " Let me tell you my idea first . " <p> Resignedly , Patty said , " Okay . " <p> " This is n't based on research ; I 've just got this gut feeling . " <p> " Your gut is golden , " Patty said . Sage did n't think it was entirely flattery . <p> " I think the outsider angle is going to catch on . The visitor from a simpler , more innocent time comes face to face with our complex , corrupt world - and conquers it through natural goodness . " <p> " Kind of a noble savage thing , " Sage put in ironically . <p> " Yeah , Rousseau without the colonialist baggage . " <p> " That 's great , D.B. ! " Patty said enthusiastically . " It fits right in with my idea . " <p> " Which is ... ? " <p> " Well , who 's the ultimate symbol of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patty paused ; no one answered . " You are , D.B. ! " she said . " She 's got to conquer you ! " <p> He looked utterly blank . " I do n't get it . " <p> " Love , D.B. ! You bring her into your house for some questionable end , but her natural goodness turns the tables , and you fall for her . No one will expect it . It 'll humanize you , make you sympathetic . The man who never has to compromise is finally conquered by love . " <p> There was a long pause . D.B. was motionless for the first time since Sage had seen him . <p> " You 're not mad , are you ? " Patty asked . <p> " I 'm not mad . " He turned away from them , brooding . <p> " You 've got to move forward , D.B. , " Patty coaxed . " Your image needs this . " <p> Without turning , D.B. said , " I think you 'd better ask her . " <p> Sage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that . " Let me get this straight , " she said . " First you try to copyright me , then you abduct me , then you try to suborn me . Now you want me to collaborate in a false scenario you 're selling to the press . " <p> " Right , " Patty said . " Jerking around the publicity machine . " <p> " And this is going to benefit me how ... ? " <p> " Oh , your stock will soar , " Patty said . " Can you imagine , the richest man on earth ? This is the ultimate image synergy . " <p> " Just imagine for a moment that I do n't want the publicity , " Sage said . " Can you give me one reason why I should do this ? " <p> D.B. looked at Patty ; Patty looked at D.B. The idea flow seemed to have run dry . At last D.B. ventured , " For the fun of it ? " <p> Sage kept thinking it could n't get any more surreal . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I 'm a scientist . Scientists are trained not to lie . I ca n't lie for you . " <p> D.B. 's expression was awestruck . " My God , Patty , " he said . " Do you know what she is ? She 's the real thing . The real fucking thing . " <p> MORNINGS ( Sage learned the next day ) were , by tacit custom , set aside for catching up on news and communications . It was the only way people could consume the enormous amounts of information required to keep the economy humming . <p> The terminals in Sage 's room boasted a vast array of competing infoservice subscriptions , each combining a different mix of television , phone , fax , rental movies , games , chat , shopping , and a host of less familiar options , all accessed through the Internet . Choosing a service at random , she tried to do a search for the people and project that had sent her here . In minutes , she felt awash in junk information . A search engine that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pop culture from the last forty years - celebrities and entertainers , scandals and scuttlebutt . She tried her favorite encyclopedia site . The brand name was still there , but the entries had all been auctioned off to advertisers . Her searches for scientific subjects kept turning up " Top Hit Topics " pushed by their sponsors . On a whim , she queried the encyclopedia for Leon Trotsky , and found him missing in action . Not profitable enough , apparently . No market potential . <p> At last , remembering what D.B. had said , she backed out and found a way to arrange the list of his infoservice subscriptions by cost . His monthly bill was staggering . An average person could obviously afford only a single service in the midrange - and in that range , there were only a few clonelike choices . Below them , cheap services clustered like vermin in the cracks , offering colorful , kinetic interfaces like Saturday morning cartoons , but only rudimentary access to bargain shopping , pornography , lotteries , and sports , heavily larded with advertising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true vastness of the information resources only became apparent here , where the search engines were sophisticated enough to find them . But they were not free . Oddly enough , the higher the price of admission , the rawer the data became , until the business and professional portals opened onto arcane libraries of unmediated information , like the neural architecture of civilization . <p> Her whirlwind tour of the infoverse left her thoughtful . She leaned back , sipping a liquid the interactive house menu called " starbucks , " which she had correctly intuited was coffee . Clearly , the Internet had not turned into a cyber-fairyland where heroic hackers ruled . On the contrary , it was about as radical as a suburban mall , and served much the same purpose . Most of what people could find there was not information at all , but processed information product - Velveeta of the mind - more convincing than the real thing . <p> Perhaps it had been naive to think everything would stay free . All the same , the way the market had debased and stratified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , work and play , information and manipulation had become hopelessly mingled . It could be she had a role in this era after all . Perhaps an outsider could warn people of dangers they could n't see . <p> In the end , Jamie Nickle was the only one from the time-travel project she was able to find outside obituaries . The project itself had disappeared into obscurity . She sent Jamie an e-mail thanking him for bringing her back to life . <p> Sage was still in pajamas when Patty came to find her shortly before noon . " Power up , " she said brightly . " You 've got to be in New York in two hours . You can take D.B. 's plane . " <p> " What for ? " <p> " An interview , " Patty said . " You 're going to be on the net . " Cautiously , Sage said , " You 're letting me talk to the media ? " <p> " Of course , " Patty said . " How else would we imprint you on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say ? " <p> " No ! Just do n't be boring , okay ? " <p> Sage realized she kept asking all the wrong questions . " How much is Metameme making off this ? " <p> " Never mind that , " Patty said . " You 're making $75,000 . " <p> A blindingly simple insight had come to Sage : Metameme sold information . As long as it was profitable , the content of that information was a matter of almost complete indifference . <p> Looking over her closet , Sage tried to think what an information warrior would wear to perform a cultural expose . She chose a flowing Japanese silk robe , worn over a black body stocking . She left her hair untouched , falling straight to her waist . The effect pleased her ; it was dramatic but elegant . <p> The only one who went with her was Hans the bodyguard , who acted as chauffeur and pilot . The plane , obviously outfitted for D.B. , had banks upon banks of video screens , a kitchen stocked with enough caffeinated beverages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bed . When their came in sight of Manhattan , the plane disdained the airport , and instead hover-landed on a rooftop pad . A network producer met her . <p> " I told them I would n't lie , " Sage said as the woman led her down a hall to the elevators . " I 'm perfectly free to answer any question . " <p> " Do n't worry , you 're wonderful , " the producer said . " That outfit is perfect , and your hair . Everyone will love you . just relax and be yourself . " <p> Sage was nervous but determined as they entered the bustling studio . An audience was already sitting in bleachers around the set , but they seemed oddly quiescent . Sage did a doubletake . " Your audience , " she said . " They 're robots . " <p> " Do n't worry , they 'll come on when we start taping , " the producer assured her . " You wo n't be able to tell the difference . None of us can . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the main set was a kitchen . Uneasily , Sage said , " What kind of questions will we cover ? " <p> " Just whatever comes up , " the producer said . " Relax , Yolanda 's a pro . Her audience profile is to die for . " <p> A black woman who radiated near-thermonuclear energy came striding toward them across the studio . " Have I gone to heaven ? " she crowed exhuberantly . " Those corporate cheapskates actually paid top dollar to get me a real guest ! And they 're even hyping it . Do you hear my heart beat ? Ratings says there 's already a spike . " Her voice dropped an octave , and she was suddenly businesslike . " Hi , honey . I 'm Yolanda . You wo n't regret this . I deliver numbers . " <p> " Uh .. good , " Sage said . <p> " You look darling in that . Oh , I 've got a feeling this is my day . " Sage waited in a room backstage till the producer came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked out into the eye-stunning brilliance of the lights . The animatronic audience gave her a standing ovation . They were so lifelike , she actually caught herself feeling flattered . <p> She sat down at the kitchen table and Yolanda poured her a cup of starbucks . With exaggerated animation , Yolanda said to the audience , " Now this is a woman with courage like most of us ca n't even imagine . Is n't she ? " They clapped . " Sage . You actually had to die to make your voyage , right ? Were n't you afraid ? " <p> Sage made a fatal error then . She actually considered the question . Had she been afraid ? Thoughtfully , she said , " Actually , I think the fear was part of the appeal .. <p> Once caught in subjectivity , it was almost impossible to break out . They talked a while about her preparations and the trip ( " Did you have any after-death experiences ? " ) , then Yolanda asked her to describe what happened when she woke up . Sage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through . <p> Yolanda glowed with empathy . " Were n't you angry at the way you were treated ? " <p> By now Sage was able to think , My feelings are n't the story here . " I was concerned by what I saw . " A lie , but she needed to steer the conversation to substantive issues . <p> Her host did n't follow the lead . " You 've met D.B. Beddoes now , right ? What do you think of this recluse billionaire who had the power to say whether you should live or not ? " The audience stirred in sympathy . <p> Distracted again , Sage said , " Well , you 're wrong to paint him as some kind of monster . The problem 's more complex than that . " <p> " Should we be worried for you ? " <p> " Oh , no . In fact , D.B. can be rather sweet . But that 's - " <p> " Sweet ? " Yolanda 's eyes grew big . <p> " Well , I mean ..... " <p> Yolanda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honey , are you lonely here ? Did you leave anyone special behind ? " <p> Oh my God . What did I just imply ? <p> Sage was so flustered that by the time Yolanda actually gave her an opening by saying , " What 's the biggest change you 've seen in the world ? " she babbled something inane about self-driving cars and flash-clean booths . <p> When the interview wrapped up and the lights went off , Sage protested , " That was a disaster ! Ca n't I do it over ? " <p> " Do n't worry , babe , " Yolanda said . " You were natural and beautiful , that 's all people see . They just want to identify with you . " <p> She had come to deliver a clarion warning , and had been limp and vacuous instead . " What came over me ? It 's like I turned into one of those robots . " <p> Yolanda 's business voice said , " Those questions I asked you , they only have one answer , but that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , then you say it , and they feel affirmed . I used to be a journalist , I know the difference . " <p> " Used to be ? Why are n't you now ? " Sage asked . <p> " Journalists do n't have control over the final product , " Yolanda said . <p> " Information production and information delivery are two completely different jobs now - and I 'm telling you , honey , all the money and security is in delivery . You have to be young and committed to be a journalist , always under pressure to nose out contracts , never knowing where the next check will come from . I could n't live like that , hand to mouth . " <p> " But there 's such a demand for information - " <p> " The public needs the truth but does n't want it . The money 's all in what they want but do n't need . " She looked away toward the now-flaccid audience and saidi " Well , speak of the devil . " <p> D.B. was standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shapeless . In alarm , Sage blurted , " D.B. ! How much did you hear ? " <p> " Just the last part , " he said . " You were fine . " <p> " Since you 're here , Mr. Beddoes , " Yolanda said in a voice like lead bullets , " maybe I can ask some questions . " <p> " No comment , " he said . " Come on , Sage . Let 's go to dinner . " <p> Still in turmoil , Sage followed him out of the studio . In the elevator she said , " I wanted to tell the truth . I wanted to warn them how dangerous it is to let the market govern the information supply . " <p> " You would n't have been sympathetic , " he said . <p> " This is n't about me ! If I soften a message just to be popular , I 'm as evil as you . " <p> " No , you 're not , " he said , trying to be comforting . <p> They walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building . Outside , it was evening , but the city lights blazed down a shining , impossible canyon . They were halfway down the broad set of steps to the sidewalk when Sage saw the paparazzi waiting for them , cameras already blinking . Suddenly , D.B. 's phone rang . <p> " Yeah ? " he said , then stopped dead . Seizing Sage 's arm , he turned around and started back up the steps . <p> " What is it ? " she said . <p> " He says not to leave the building . " <p> His pace was unhurried , but his grip on her arm was vise-tight . Back inside , a security guard came racing across the lobby toward them . " This way , Mr. Beddoes , " he said , hurrying them toward the elevator while another guard locked the glass doors behind them . Outside , a siren wailed to a stop . <p> In the elevator , Sage said , " You can let go of my arm now . " <p> He dropped it as if it singed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking on a headset when he met them at the top floor . He escorted them protectively to the plane . Once inside and in the air , D.B. dialed a number and said , " What the hell was that about ? " He listened a while , then said , " Did they get him ? " Then , " Okay . Let me talk to Patty . " Moments later , he said , " Well , that was sure a fiasco . Did you get any pictures at all ? " Pause . " Easy for you to say . You did n't have some jerk trying to get famous by waving a gun at your back . Oh yeah ? Well , fuck schadenfreude . From now on be more careful who you leak my schedule to . " He hung up on her and sat brooding . <p> Sage had picked up an important point from that exchange . " That was a photo op , was n't it ? " she said . " Patty planted those paparazzi to photograph us together . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not . " <p> He gazed at her sulkily . <p> " You egotistical bastard ! " She felt manipulated . Her indignation nearly levitated her from her seat . Or maybe it was just the plane leveling off . <p> " Patty says your approval numbers are going stratospheric , " he said a little resentfully . <p> Outside the plane window , the sky had turned black , but the ground below them was still glowing in sunlight . " My God , so is this plane , " Sage said , gripping the arms of her seat . " Where are we going ? " <p> " To dinner . " <p> " Where ? " <p> " Hong Kong . " <p> A LARGE SECTION of downtown Victoria had been destroyed in an earthquake , and in its place had risen a set of three shining , silver towers that grazed the underside of hubris . As the plane circled , the afternoon sun turned them incendiary . <p> " The south one 's mine , " D.B. said absently . " But we 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people were n't kidding when they said he was rich . <p> They climbed from the plane onto a windy platform that jutted from the north tower like a fungus from a tree trunk . Sage found the height exhilarating ; across the strait the skyscrapers of Kowloon looked like miniatures , and the mountain-framed harbor was freckled with tiny boats . But Hans was getting nervous at her standing near the edge , so she followed D.B. inside . <p> The maitre d ' ushered them to a window table . D.B. was still edgy and morose until they had polished off a bottle of pinot noir ; then he asked about her day . <p> " Did you know that Leon Trotsky has been expunged from the collective memory ? " she said . <p> " Hmm . My day was n't so hot , either . " <p> " Do n't you care ? " <p> He shrugged . " He was part of a memeplex the culture got inoculated against last.century . You know why ? " <p> " Why ? " Sage said fatalistically . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The least people want from their government is entertainment . Once everyone realized the class war was over and it was just going to be five-year plans from here on in , they knew what a yawner they 'd created , and flushed it for something with more pizzazz . " <p> She fitted that answer into her picture of him . " So do n't you ever have labor trouble ? " <p> " Labor ? " he stared at her . " Information is n't made in factories . " <p> " It still takes work to produce . " <p> " Oh , well , I do n't employ the producers , I told you that . Journalists , researchers - they make bad employees . Anyone with a commitment to a set of professional standards ca n't be completely loyal to the company . So I just buy their product , and leave the standards up to them . " <p> " Along with the financial risk , " she said . " This whole economy of yours rests on the backs of exploited information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor . " <p> " What is this , a barbecue ? " he said , irritated . <p> " You 're a regressive thinker , D.B. " <p> " You 're the one from the past . " <p> " Besides being a manipulative s.o.b . " <p> " Hot damn , what a romantic dinner this is . " <p> But by the time the food came , Sage was feeling pleasantly buzzed ; the bordeaux with dinner and cognac afterward made her temporarily forgive the day for its disappointments . There would be other days , other chances to denounce him . <p> The sun was low and coppery behind the headland when they finished , and the city lights were beginning to twinkle . " We ca n't go back yet , " Sage said . " I 've got to touch ground , or I wo n't feel like I 've been here . " So they took a glass elevator to the plaza between the towers and strolled through a cloud of pigeons to an abstract sculpture in the center of the square . Sage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asian sky turn electric pink and orange , her thoughts pinwheeling pleasantly in her head . The air was balmy and sensual , smelling of the sea . And , yes , there was a pleasant exhilaration at being with a man who could buy the inner solar system and still leave a tip . <p> Suddenly , he leaned over and pecked her on the cheek . She looked at him in surprise . Was he blushing , or was it the sunset ? <p> " Was that for the reporters ? " she asked . <p> " No , " he said awkwardly . " That was for me . Sorry . " <p> It was endearingly inept . " That was no kiss , " she informed him . " This is a kiss . " She took his head in her hands and gave him a long , lingering kiss . A thorough kiss , one that would take . <p> When she pulled away , his glasses were fogged up . He fumbled to wipe them . Laughing , she said , " Race you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost a shoe halfway across the plaza , but beat him anyway . Laughing breathlessly , she started back to get it , but he caught her hand and said , " Leave it . Maybe some prince will find it and come after you . " <p> " What would I do with a prince ? " she said . <p> " I do n't know . Kiss him . Confuse him . " <p> She realized he was n't joking . <p> They returned silently to the plane . The last shreds of brilliance were fading from the sky when they took off . D.B. watched it out the window , unaware she was looking at him , at the expression of longing on his face . It seemed implausible that a man like him could long for anything . <p> " Sage , I 've got an idea , " he said , turning to her . " Let 's fly on to Paris and see the sunset again . " <p> She smiled . " We ca n't just go chasing sunsets around the globe . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're adults . We 've got responsibilities . Especially you . " <p> He turned back restlessly to the window . Fidgeting with the arm of his chair , he said , " That was one hell of a meme you gave me . " <p> " People have been passing that one around for a long time . " <p> " I guess so . " He paused . " That was all just playacting , right ? " <p> She found it hard to answer . Because , unexpectedly , she was n't sure . At last she said , " Sure . If that 's what it was for you , that 's what it was for me . " <p> The liquor that had made her so giddy was now putting her to sleep . She reclined her seat as far as it would go and started dozing off to the drone of the engines . Later , she roused momentarily to find him still awake , still watching her with an expression too complex to decode . <p> SAGE WOKE in her own bed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face had launched a thousand tabloids . <p> THE KISS was emblazoned across one Web page , along with a telephoto shot of her and D.B. on the plaza in Hong Kong . Another page was auctioning her lost shoe for several thousand dollars . " Shit , ' ! she said , and called Patty . <p> " Who approved those photos ? " she demanded , her temples throbbing . <p> " I did , " Patty said , cheerful enough to deserve summary execution . There was a new collection of objects in her hair . An Oriental drink parasol and a tiny Venus de Milo . " Do n't worry , I 'm taking care of everything . " <p> " I did n't want that spread all over the net , " Sage said . " It was private . " <p> " If you wanted privacy , Sage , you sure picked the wrong planet . Not to mention the wrong guy . " <p> After Sage hung up , she sat thinking : as long as she was part of the Metameme pseudo-reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sincere acts and unpremeditated words would be manipulated into lies . <p> She needed to get away . But to where ? She had no friends , no family to run to . No money , no skills . Nothing marketable but notoriety . <p> Nevertheless , she needed to escape . As far as she knew , there was only one way out of D.B. 's house , the guarded underground tunnel . After dressing and eating aspirin for lunch , Sage went out to the pine-tree room . No one was around to observe her , so she took the elevator down to the bottom level . <p> To her surprise , the limo was waiting at the curb . Glancing around , she got in . As soon as the door closed , the vehicle started rolling silently forward . She waited , hoping the guards would think it was D.B. and let her through . <p> Abreast of the checkpoint , the car came to a stop .. One of the phone screens buzzed . Sage hesitated , but at last touched the " answer " icon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing a rumpled sweatshirt . <p> " Where are you going ? " he said . <p> " Out , " she said , keeping her face impenetrable . <p> He absorbed her expression , and his face turned as uncommunicative as hers . " Would you mind taking another car ? That one 's a little conspicuous . " <p> " I 'll take the lawnmower if I have to , " Sage said . <p> " Okay , get out and I 'll send something else . " <p> She got out and the limo rolled away backward , disappearing around a curve in the tunnel . The guard in the glass booth opposite her was trying not to watch . Soon another vehicle came self-propelled up the tunnel  --  a sleek , silver sports convertible . Sage did n't recognize the make , but the design was a universal language : the car burned pure sex appeal . She wondered what D.B. thought of her , to have chosen that car . <p> There was a steering wheel , accelerator , and brake , but all the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got into the driver 's seat , the phone rang . Sighing , she answered . <p> " Do you know how to program it ? " D.B. asked . <p> " Ca n't I just drive it ? " <p> " No . It 's illegal on the freeways . Traffic control laws . Just tell me where you want to go and I 'll program it from here . " <p> " I suppose you can trace where I go anyway . " <p> In a martyred tone he said , " Sage , I apologize for my world . Cars do n't come without tracer functions now . " <p> There was no help for it , so she told him to send her to the university . The screen flashed to a different mode as he programmed it . " When you want to come back , just hit ' Return , " ' he said . She refrained from commenting on whether she was going to come back . <p> It was a crisp and sunny day , and as the car cruised down the winding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind in her hair and ( with only a twinge of self-consciousness ) the chic and muscular machine cornering lithely beneath her . She found a pair of sunglasses in the glove box and put them on so she would match the car . <p> At the freeway the car shot up the ramp toward a solid wall of traffic , and she found the brake did n't work . Just when a collision seemed imminent , a sports-car-sized notch opened up , and her vehicle merged . Traveling at full speed only six inches from the car ahead gave her panic reflexes a workout , but the traffic flowed smoothly at a volume that would have caused apocalyptic jams in her time . <p> On the road into downtown , her own face loomed from a video billboard . For a distraction she tried the radio , but the first thing to issue from it was a come-on for a program called " Sage : Enchantress from the Other Side of Time . " She turned it off , gagging . <p> Just then she noticed the patrol car behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking control of your vehicle , " the officer said when she answered . " Turn on your fax machine and we will send the warrant . " <p> " What have I done ? " Sage asked as her vehicle veered onto an offramp . <p> " You have been subpoenaed to appear at the Federal Courthouse . " <p> " What for ? " <p> " You 'll have to ask them that , ma'am . " <p> The car auto-negotiated a tangle of ramps that disgorged into downtown traffic . With the police close behind , she pulled up to the curb before a tall steel-and-glass building set back from the street behind a concrete plaza . A small crowd was waiting there , including two camera teams . As Sage got out , a woman reporter dashed over and put a microphone to her face . " Sage , do you have some ancient tribal medicine that explains your sexual magnetism ? " <p> A tall , balding man in a brown suit met her at the curb . " Ms. Akwesasne , I represent a consortium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit to force a fairer distribution of information concerning you . We need your testimony to prove that there has been an illegal restraint of trade - " <p> A shiny black car pulled up at the curb , and Mr. Jabhwalla jumped out , looking perfectly composed and elegant . " I would advise you not to say anything , " he told Sage . <p> " Oh , so now you 're threatening the witness ? " the other lawyer said . " I believe we got that on tape . " Two video cameras swung to Mr. Jabhwalla 's face for a reaction . <p> " She 's not your witness , " he said imperturbably . " Your subpoena has no force over her . This is n't Sage Akwesasne . She is a replica . " In an undertone to Sage he said , " I can take care of this , if you want to go on about your business . You just need to sign here - " <p> An interruption saved her from having to tell him where to put his contract . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the plaza from the courthouse door . He was a burly , bearded man in a camouflage jacket and combat boots , waving a legal paper over his head . " Court order ! " he was shouting . " Court order ! " The two lawyers exchanged a look of mutual commiseration . <p> " Make way for the rights of the consumers , you corporate weevils ! " the newcomerbellowed as he came up . " I 'm Harry Dolnick , the consumer 's candidate for city council , and I 've got here a court order for Sage Akwesasne to publicly reveal the message she brought back from the Holians . " <p> " I beg your pardon ? " Sage said , perplexed . <p> He turned around to speak to one of the cameras . " Who are the Holians , you ask ? We do n't know what they call themselves . The fact that aliens live around the black hole has been known to the global elite for years , but you and I could only learn of their existence from the underground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media . The Holians would never have let a human being pass through their space without sending a message back , encoded in her DNA . It only stands to reason . " <p> " What ? " Sage said . <p> " The question is , what 's in the message that is so valuable that the globals are standing here fighting over legal control of her ? There could only be one answer . It 's a contract offer to market Brand Earth on an interstellar scale . " <p> " You see the kind of irritation we can protect you from , " Mr. Jabhwalla whispered in her ear . <p> Something D.B. had once said about the Promethean quality of her story came back to Sage . Only now the myth seemed to have mutated into a hybrid of capitalism and conspiracy theory . " Listen , " she said . The cameras swiveled round to her face . " I can comply with your court order right now . There are no Holians , and there 's no contract offer in my DNA . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry Dolnick thundered . " Here in this pool of piranhas ? No , " he addressed the crowd , " this is why the consumers need to rise up and demand their rights ! We should all be shareholders in Brand Earth ! " The office workers on lunch break continued munching their sandwiches and waving at the cameras . One of them offered Harry Dolnick an autograph book and he paused to sign it . <p> The woman reporter had pushed to Sage 's elbow , and now said , " Sage , my viewers are demanding to know something . What brand of lipstick are you wearing ? " <p> " Dear God , get me out of here , " Sage muttered . <p> Mr. Jabhwalla 's phone rang . He answered it , then silently handed it to Sage . <p> " This makes terrific theater , " D.B. said . " You ought to see how many sites we 're streaming this to . " <p> " Do you have me under surveillance ? " Sage glanced up , half expecting to spot a Metameme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television , like the rest of the western hemisphere , " he said . She looked at one of the cameras , held by a beefy man in sandals . " Yeah , that one , " he said . <p> " They 're yours ? " <p> " No , they 're freelancers . We 're just buying their feed . " <p> " Did you set this up ? " she demanded . The lawyers , who had been arguing , paused to look at her . She turned her back and lowered her voice . <p> " Did you start these rumors about aliens and genetic messages ? " <p> " No , those are wild memes that mutated spontaneously into existence . You 're like hermeneutical flypaper , Sage . Theories just stick to you . " <p> " You need to squelch them ! " she said . <p> " What for ? " He sounded puzzled . <p> " Because they 're wacko claptrap ! " <p> " So ? That does n't mean they ca n't be profitable . " <p> Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard of information , only profit . <p> " You look a little irritated , " D.B. said . She was searching for a sufficiently blistering word when he said , " Tell you what . Turn around and look across the street . " <p> She did . There was nothing there but a large building of gray granite . " See the ground floor door ? " he said . " Go in there . " <p> " But .. it 's the public library , " she said . <p> " I know . I own it . " <p> Now that he mentioned it , she saw the stylized MM logo on the signage . " How did you - " <p> " Never mind , just do it . Someone will meet you . " <p> She started pushing her way through the crowd . Mr. Jabhwalla said , " Wait ! You ca n't leave without - " <p> " You said yourself , I 'm not Sage Akwesasne , " she told him . " Now back off before I sue you for unlawful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " D.B. said . Sage hung up the phone and tossed it back to the lawyer . <p> All the way across the street she was mobbed by teenage girls offering notebooks and body parts for her to autograph . When she reached the staff entrance , a librarian waiting inside pushed it open for her , and she slipped through , relieved by the quiet inside . " Follow me , " the woman said . <p> They went up a back stairway to a hallway lined with offices . The librarian stopped before what looked like a closet door and said , " Wait here while I get the key . " Sage stood staring at a motivational poster on the corridor wall that showed a soaring eagle with the caption , <p> Free Speech which someone had defaced , " Only $91.95/month . " <p> The librarian came back and opened the door onto a spiral , cast-iron staircase . Puzzled , Sage followed her onto the gravel roof . The wind was blowing , bringing the sound of Harry Dolnick 's voice up from the street below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , with a blast of dust and gravel , it landed vertically on the other end of the roof , and she recognized its outline . As the door opened and the steps extended , Sage dashed over to it , wondering when it had started to seem normal to be plucked off a rooftop by a private jet . <p> Inside , D.B. was talking to half a dozen people at once on his video screens . Feeling defeated , Sage slouched into a leather seat as the plane took off . Her attempt to escape the constructed reality of Metameme had only landed her in other realities where her identity was no more her own than here . It was like being a quark , constructed entirely of spin . <p> The problem was larger than she had supposed . Wired together in a free-market free-for-all , the collective brains of the human race had actually invented a world where it was impossible to tell the truth . <p> The landscape had dwindled into a wrinkled counterpane below by the time D.B. cut off his connections and came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw he was dressed in a tuxedo . It had a remarkable effect . He had an embryonic air of distinction . <p> " Where are we going now ? " Sage asked . <p> " Washington D.C. You wanted to meet the president . Well , our guy won the election , so we 're going to the victory party . " <p> " Your guy ? " Sage looked at him balefully . " I 'm going to hate his politics , are n't I ? " <p> " I do n't know . " D.B. shrugged , fiddling self-consciously with his cuffs . " Look , he 's only our guy because we engineered his image . You 'll have to ask him about politics . As far as I know , he 's like all the others , pro-prosperity . " <p> " That 's safe . " <p> " Uh , Sage , this is going to be kind of formal . You might want to order something to wear . " <p> With a feeling of impending doom , she sat down at one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fashionable . The range of choices was bewildering . Briefly , she thought of asking Patty 's advice , then remembered the tiger skin . Finally , unable to decipher any pattern , she opted for simplicity : a low-cut , shimmering crimson sheath held up with spaghetti straps . The computer suggested a matching shawl , shoes , and purse , so she went for the whole package , muttering when it did n't tell her the price . <p> " Trust me , you can afford it , " D.B. said . <p> When the plane came down on a rooftop just at the edge of restricted air space , a delivery company was waiting with a pile of packages . Sage gathered them in , then shooed D.B. out of the plane . Alone , she stripped and stepped into the flash clean booth . When she slipped on the dress , it felt like water against her skin , sleek and caressing . The earrings dangled like stone kisses against her neck , just heavy enough to let her know they were there . She gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped to the door . <p> The look of sheer exhilaration on D.B. 's face told her she had scored a bullseye . He offered his arm , and she took it , giving it a little squeeze for the moral support . <p> A limo was waiting for them on the floor below . As it whisked them through the streets , D.B. peered out the windows with growing unease . At last Sage said , " What 's the matter ? " <p> " Nothing . I just hate these party things , " he said . <p> By the time the limo pulled into a blocked-off street behind the Capitol building , he was gripping his knees in an obvious paroxysm of nerves . Sage leaned forward and put a hand on his . " Look at it this way , " she said . " You 're not yourself , you 're an actor playing the richest man in the world . The others - well , the script calls for them to envy you . " <p> He looked at her , a long look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There was a crowd of spectators and reporters lining the monumental stone steps of the building across the street . As soon as Sage and D.B. stepped out of the car , there was a trampling rush toward them , and their driver and bodyguard had to clear a path . A broad red cascade of carpet led up the stairway , with the crowds held back by ropes and stanchions on either side . As soon as they started up , Sage could feel the pressure of a hundred lenses on her . It was so distracting they were halfway up before she realized what the building was . <p> " The Library of Congress ? " she whispered at D.B. " Do you own this one , too ? " <p> " Do n't start , Sage , " D.B. said through his teeth . " I just help them out . They 're like the rest of the government , so underfunded they could n't pay the electric bill unless I bought information from them . " <p> They passed through towering arches into the Great Hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bronze nymphs , gilt , and bared-tooth glamor . The party spilled down mosaic-floored halls on either side and up the stairs to the pillared balconies above . With a sinking heart , Sage saw she had guessed radically wrong on fashion - the style called for ruffles and flounces . Most women entering were peeling off from their escorts to visit the ladies ' lounge , so Sage parted from D.B. and followed the stream . <p> When she entered the restroom , a group of women were having an animated conversation that broke off abruptly when they saw her . They all took out their phones ; with a snick like so many switchblades , the retractable screens unfolded and the women began perusing the photos of themselves that had been taken as they came up the steps . Silence fell , except for the curses and cries of disappointment as the photos inevitably failed to live up to expectation . Sage went into one of the marble stalls to hide . A video screen inside the stall door helpfully offered to order her a different dress . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined him again . They broke off shop talk and eagerly introduced themselves to her , and she had to parry several jocular remarks about the past . The men 's female companions looked on with frozen smiles . As D.B. was drawing her away to get some wine , an artfully sculpted woman leaned forward and whispered in her ear , " Nice accessorizing , dear . And in such a short time . Clever you . " <p> " These people are hateful , " Sage whispered to D.B. as they moved away . Rebelliously , she took his arm to prove he was more than just an accessory . <p> " Here , get drunk , " he suggested , plucking a flute of champagne from a passing tray . <p> Another businessman approached him with a hearty , " D.B. , you 're like a new man ! I saw the turnaround in your popularity numbers . Enough to give a person whiplash . Listen , I 've got something you might be interested in .... " <p> D.B. looked like he was thinking of driving a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last the businessman moved on , Sage said , " Do you have a phone with you ? " <p> " Of course , " he said . " Why ? " <p> " I 'd like to approve my own pictures . " <p> " Do n't worry , Patty 's handling it . " <p> " No . I 'd like to approve my own pictures . " <p> He hesitated , then took a phone from his pocket and gave it to her . " Do n't do it here , " he said . " Take it somewhere private . " She slipped it in her purse . <p> Just then the string quartet that had been playing Vivaldi broke into a country western tune . All eyes turned to the balcony above , where the victorious candidate appeared . He was a weatherbeaten man wearing a tuxedo with cowboy hat and boots . He waved to the universal applause , then started making his way around the balcony and down the white marble stairs , shaking hands and greeting supporters along the way . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other candidates , " D.B. explained in an undertone . " He was running against the late-night comedians . So we hired a team of crack joke writers and made him the funniest guy on the net . The electorate laughed all the way to the polls . Voter participation went up to thirty percent . " <p> " What a boon to democracy , " Sage said . <p> " It just proves you ca n't act like customers owe you their attention . You 've got to earn it . " <p> The president-elect had come opposite them . On seeing D.B. he did a comic doubletake , then said , " D.B. Beddoes , in public ! Say , how does it feel to be popular all of a sudden ? No , wait - I know ! " As everyone around him laughed , he took D.B. 's hand and leaned close to say , " Thanks for the media blitz the last few days . You crowded my opponent 's little bombshell right off the air . Good work . " <p> Sage turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , " You jerk ! " she said . <p> D.B. gripped her arm tightly . " Sage , let me introduce <p> " No , " she said , pulling her arm away . " Is that what this has all been about ? You 've been using me as a smokescreen to manipulate an election ? " <p> " No , " he said , flushing crimson . <p> " Well , let me tell you something , Mr. Beddoes . I still happen to believe in democracy , and I will not be used as your corporate tool to corrupt the process . " <p> By now , he had gotten angry . " I have done more to promote democracy than Thomas fucking Jefferson . " <p> " By burying people in infocrap till they 're incapable of judgment or reason ? Before you trot out your cynical market populism , let me say something . Democracy 's not just about customer satisfaction . It 's not about finding the lowest common denominator . It 's about finding the highest . " <p> The whole room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we talk about this some other time ? " <p> " No , " Sage said , " because there 's not going to be another time . I 've had it with you . I 'm asserting my copyright . I 'm going out there to expose you . " <p> " Fine ! " he said . " Go for it ! Then maybe I 'll just run off another copy of you that suits me better . " <p> It felt like a gut-punch to her humanity . There was even an intake of breath in the listening crowd . " Go back to hell , " Sage said , and walked away in the first direction that offered an empty space , which happened to be up the stairs . Silent people in gowns and tails moved out of her way as she climbed the marble steps in the most conspicuous exit she could have chosen . <p> Once on the second floor , Sage headed down a random hallway till she was out of the crowd , and heard the hum of conversation resume behind her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down a long gallery into an empty , octagonal exhibit hall . On the western wall was a line of three tall glass doors letting onto a pillared balcony . She lifted the heavy old latch and went outside . <p> At first she paced up and down behind towering columns , replaying the argument in her mind till her temper cooled . She looked out over the low stone balustrade . The setting sun was shining through the windows in the Capitol dome , making it look transparent and fragile , like everything it represented . She suddenly felt trapped and friendless . He had said it all : she was just product , only of value if the demand exceeded the supply . <p> Below on the street , partygoers were still arriving , the cameras still shooting . Doubtless , the scene that had just taken place was already on the net . To distract herself , she took D.B. 's phone from her purse , opened the screen , and spoke her own name into the search box . It responded with a cascade of hits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sage . " Curious , she opened it and found an assortment of documents , D.B. 's private collection . One of them was an e-mail to her from Jamie Nickle , sent two days ago and never received . <p> No longer feeling like she was snooping , she opened it . <p> Sage , ( it said ) <p> There is something I have to let you know about . I did n't have time today , and God knows when we might see each other again . This is it : Years ago , shortly after we sent you off to the future , another team of physicists proved that the universe is temporally symmetrical . That is , for every quantum particle that travels forward in time , there is another identical one that goes backward , and those backward particles ( which they called " quirks , " ha ha ) are detectable . You can check with me for details . This is the point : we instantly realized it would be possible to aim a quirkstream at the same black hole that sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , send a message backward to any date when a quirk detector existed . <p> Of course , the first thing we did was build a quirk detector . Since we had just sent someone forward , we thought the future might respond by sending someone back , so we made sure we could reassemble anyone who came through . It took us five years ; and since you have now been here five years , the time has just now come when we can send a person back and know they will be received . <p> So if for any reason you do n't like it here and want to go back , the technology exists . Just give me a call . <p> Jamie <p> The relief Sage felt was dizzying . She was not trapped or friendless . She had a way out of this time , and back to her own . Laughing aloud , she kissed the screen that had brought her the news , then folded it up and put it back in her purse . The sun had come out from behind the dome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photons . Behind her , the door clicked , and she glanced around . It was D.B. He had ripped off his bowtie and disposed of the body , and his hair looked like he had been tearing at it . <p> He just stood watching her at first , and she watched the sun , her back to him . At last , when the silence had grown over-long , he said , " Listen . That was just about the stupidest thing I ever said . " <p> She said nothing , waiting to see where this would go . <p> " I would n't do it , " he said . " I 'd be crazy to copy you . Your whole value is in your uniqueness , the fact there 's no one else like you . " <p> That finally made her turn around . He was looking at her with the same expression he had looked at the sunset the night before , the one he had wanted to chase even knowing he could never possess it . " Look , I 'll destroy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't answer , he said , " All right , I 'll give it to you , and you can destroy it . Or whatever . " <p> Now that he had no ultimate power over her , much of the ice had melted from her anger . " All right , " she said . " It 's a deal . No backups . " <p> " No backups . " There was an awkward pause . He came forward to the balustrade and looked out , avoiding her gaze . " I could n't say it back there , but the idea that I would use you to affect something as paltry as an election - well , it 's ludicrous . You do n't get what you are , Sage . I did n't want to use you to change the government for the next four years . I wanted to change the world for centuries to come . " <p> He gestured dismissively at the hub of earthly power . " This world does n't live up to my expectations . It needs a heart transplant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you are the highest-caliber archetype I 'm ever likely to lay my hands on . It took me five years to set it up . I was going to knock the culture off its orbit with you . You were going to be the first woman of your kind , homo novus . " <p> " I 'm more than just a meme , D.B. , " she said . <p> " Believe it or not , I have figured that out . " He glanced at her sideways . <p> " No one ever accused you of being dumb , " she said . <p> He chewed his lip , his hands in his pockets . " I was thinking just now , when I was angry at you - probably seventy percent of the women in that room would sleep with me . " <p> From Sage 's observations , the estimate was low . But she shook her head . " Not with you , D.B. With your brand name . " <p> " Whereas the one woman I 'd like to - no , damn it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> She drew breath to save him , but he said , " No , shut up . I 've got to figure out how to say this without making it sound like it 's all about lust , because it 's not . Only partly . Damn . " He pounded his fist against the granite pillar , then shook it in pain . " Ouch . The thing is , there 's another reason I could n't copy you . Because I do n't want a copy . I want the original . The only drawback is , you do n't give a shit whether I live or die . " <p> " That 's not true . " <p> He looked at her , hugging his bruised hand under the other arm . " Does that mean the ' die ' vote won ? " <p> " Do you know what I just found out ? " She leaned against the pillar , feeling the warm stone on her bare back . " There is a way to travel backward in time . It 's possible for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face froze in a look of tachycardiac horror . " No ! " He spun around and paced away , fists clenched in rage and frustration . " God fucking damn ! " He turned back on her . " How did you find out ? " Then , before she could answer , realization crossed his face . " My phone ! Oh , how could I have such crap for brains ? " <p> Watching calmly , she said , " You knew . You were hiding it from me . " <p> " I had to , Sage ! I need you here . I did n't want you to get away . I banked everything on you . " <p> " I 'm not your intellectual property , D.B. I deserve to decide for myself . " <p> She watched the thought come upon him that he had actually lost , that he no longer controlled any of the variables . He looked stunned at such an alien state of affairs . <p> " I do n't know what to say , " he said numbly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He studied her face , and she could actually see new thoughts dawning on him . " You would n't , would you ? " he said . When she did n't answer , he came forward , putting his hands on her arms . " Sage - if <p> The opportunity was too good to pass up . She pulled him close by the lapels and kissed him . It took him by surprise again , but not so badly as the night before , and it was a far more satisfying experience . <p> " Oh , God , Sage , " he breathed when it was over . " Let 's go - " <p> She put a finger on his lips . " Shut up , " she said tenderly . " That was n't my answer . " <p> " It was n't ? " <p> " This is my problem , D.B. You 're a dangerous megalomaniac . You manipulate people as naturally as you breathe . I find your life work reprehensible ; I loathe your politics . You 're also cute and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really want to take off in your plane , if you know what I mean . " <p> He started to say something , but she stopped him again . " If I stay here , there 's not a chance I 'll be able to keep away from you , and I do n't know if my nerves can handle it . So I 've decided to go back . I just have n't figured out when . " <p> He took it calmly . " I guess that 's the best I could hope for . " <p> Too calmly . It made her suspicious . " Did you know I was going to say that ? <p> " Well , " he admitted , " the thing is , you did go back . It 's part of the historical record . " <p> She pushed him away . " What historical record ? I looked for information on our project . There was n't any . " <p> " There 's some information not even I will sell . " <p> " You bastard ! So if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was this all about ? " <p> " The historical record does n't say how long you spent here . You would never say a word about the future , or anything you did here . You said it was for fear of making it happen . " <p> She looked out at the Capitol dome against the scarlet sky , on the street below where the photographers were hauling out infrared cameras to get a better shot of the drama on the balcony . " So I was n't able to prevent any of this , " she said . " That means it 's inevitable . " <p> " Absolutely inevitable , " he said . <p> " Well then , " she said , " I guess I better get used to it . " - ; jr <p> Sidebar
