George W. Bush usually likes to have a little fun at Larry Lindsey 's expense . As the President 's chief economic adviser , Lindsey must trek downstairs to the Oval Office three days a week and brief his boss , the Vice President and other top aides on the state of the American economy . Lately , Lindsey has barely been able to get a word out of his mouth before the President starts giving him grief . " When are you gon na bring me some good news , Lawrence ? " Bush asks with a wink or a grin . " Any good news today , Lawrence ? " <P> But last week the news was so bad that Bush was hardly in a mood to kid around . The nation 's unemployment rate , which had remained steady  --  and low  --  while other indicators turned bleak , leaped to 4.9% on Friday , its highest level in four years . Wall Street was raining red arrows as the Dow lost 427 points in just two days  --  3.5% for the week  --  while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief of staff Andy Card 's office , top Bush aides decided to clear the President 's afternoon schedule and dispatched him , grim faced , to the South Lawn of the White House to reassure Americans  --  and the markets  --  that he was " deeply concerned . " They summoned House Speaker Dennis Hastert and Senate minority leader Trent Lott for the occasion  --  a deliberate display , says a top aide , " to show that the Republicans remain united . " Lott and Hastert stood by as Bush declared , " We 've got a plan to get our economy moving so Americans can find work . " After he spoke , Wall Street kept going south . <P> For months the White House has been trying to find the perfect pitch for Bush 's words about the anemic economy : showing he is aware but not alarmed , positive but not Pollyannaish . This kind of delicate hand holding may be as much as any President can do to alter the course of a sprawling national economy . Having already deployed his most powerful weapon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spend Social Security surplus money , he is left to temper the worry during the wait . But the longer it lasts , the more the downturn is foreshortening Bush 's plans and expectations , endangering everything he wants to get done in office . The downturn has taken chunks out of the magical budget surplus , threatening the President 's plans to reform education and rebuild the military . Suddenly there 's talk of a second Bush recession . <P> Although Bush was flanked by Vice President Dick Cheney and G.O.P. congressional leaders , the far bigger presence on the South Lawn Friday was the memory of his father , whose perceived lack of concern for average people during the last recession cost him a second term . Faced with the 1990-91 downturn , " 41 , " as his son calls him , was n't much for feeling people 's pain or offering them relief . Washington should stand back and " let the economy right itself , " the former President used to say , and it eventually did  --  just in time for him to lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeble and sometimes laughable . In a famous photo op in 1991 to send the message to consumers to spend , he bought some tube socks . On a visit to economically devastated New Hampshire , Bush Sr. sounded like an automaton when he uttered the words , " Message : I care . " The son is different , say aides . " He 's learned his father 's lesson , " says a senior White House aide . " The American people need to see you , and you need to show them that you care . "
