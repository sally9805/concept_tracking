<p> The typical American male thinks about kinky sex but rarely does anything about it . <p> That may change  --  tonight . <p> Our exclusive poll of 2,131 women reveals some surprising desires KINKY . <p> The word can conjure up unsavory images : leather-clad ne'er-do-wells brandishing whips , emotionally crippled Dungeons and Dragons aficionados prancing in military regalia . The Gimp in Pulp Fiction . <p> It makes you wonder , Who needs to go to all that trouble ? And why ? <p> Most of us men are simple creatures . We know what we like , and we like what we know . So we 're reluctant to replace a good old-fashioned horizontal bop with a session that requires a trunkful of apparatus , significant prep time , and possibly a run to the drugstore . <p> On the other hand . ca n't there be wholesome kink ? Something cleaner , less coercive and more collaborative , more fun and less frightening ? Like , say , your woman , dressed as a cheerleader , behind the stadium with you . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thought so . <p> I was a man of simple pleasures until , through a twisted twist of fate , I found myself a reluctant ( really ! ) participant in an orgy . Within a week , I became the world 's unlikeliest sex columnist , for Nerve.com . After more than 30 truly kinky adventures  --  some of which I liked , many that still give me night terrors  --  I can report that I am no Caligula . But the experiences taught me that an occasional adventure in the bedroom ( or outside of it ) is a great way to avoid a rut in your rutting . <p> Now comes the liberating news that we men are not alone in our desires . When Men 's Health polled more than 2,000 Cosmopolitan readers , we learned that women are waiting for us to suggest a few deviations from the norm . Our favorite stat : More than 90 percent of women sound eager  --  they 're " game to try " something kinky ( 70 percent ) or downright " excited " at the prospect ( 21.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it helps , do n't call it kink . " Think of it as fun  --  a romp , really  --  more than kinky , " says Sue Johanson , a sex educator and the host of Talk Sex with Sue Johanson , on the Oxygen network . <p> Consider this a fun starter guide to kink 's simpler pleasures  --  and leave the truly freaky stuff to the Germans . BDSM <p> Do n't let the unsexy acronym put you off . BDSM stands for bondage , domination , submission , and masochism . For now let 's address the B and a little D , which is more popular than you might think . I have yet to meet a woman who has not enjoyed being tied to a headboard now and then . Amanda , a 27-year-old advertising saleswoman , is typical : " I 'm a pretty confident , successful career woman . The feeling of being helpless and dominated was really novel and a massive turn-on . " Does n't sound like your girl ? You 'd be surprised . The women in our poll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excites them . ( See the survey results on page 165 . ) <p> " There is a sense of being erotically overwhelmed that comes along with being restrained , and many women find it quite passionate , " says Carol Queen , Ph.D. , staff sexologist at Good Vibrations , a woman-owned and - operated sex-toy empire . " Women are encouraged to understand themselves as objects of desire , and through bondage and restraint , there 's an acting out of that . " <p> AT FIRST : During one of your typical romps , use your hands to restrain hers above her head . If she seems to like that ( go ahead , ask ) , consider taking it further the next time around . Grab neckties , silk scarves , or a pair of stockings . Use gentle knots and give yourself access to all areas . Then resume what you were doing . Only slower . <p> Spanking can liven things up . " How hard one should spank depends on the person , " says Emma Taylor , one half of the sex-writing duo Em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Etiquette . " Always err on the side of reserve , and gradually build up to rudeness . " Start with a light tap . If she laughs , laugh along with her . Consider a moan permission to continue . <p> LATER : Laidie Magenta is a dominatrix in the big leagues of New York City . Heed Laidie Magenta 's instructions ; do not displease her : " BDSM can be dangerous if embarked upon by someone inexperienced and too eager . It 's best to be prepared with some knowledge so no one gets hurt . " Before you start , agree on a " safe word " to let each other know when you 've had enough . " Saying no might be an integral part of the fantasy , so make sure your safe word is something totally out of context , " says sex educator Jamye Waxman . Like " peanut butter , " " Seattle , " or " toy boat . " ( Unless your fantasy involves all three , in which case you are no newcomer to kink . ) <p> HER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I are n't about going out and purchasing a set of handcuffs . But one time during sex he said , ' Okay , you do n't get to use your hands , " and that really added a whole new level . We would take turns : He would hold on to the headboard and I 'd do my thing , then we 'd switch . I like feeling that he could just have his way with me and I 'd be powerless to stop him . It 's total trust , and that 's sexy . "  --  Carley , 26 , social worker <p> CAMERAS &; ACTION <p> So you want her to be a Hilton ? Do n't get your hopes up . Only 15 percent of the women in our survey had videotaped their bedroom antics , presumably because of what happened to Paris and other Web victims . That said , " to see what we look like in the heat of passion fulfills our deepest curiosity about something primal in our lives , " says Candida Royalle , author of How to Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her line . No guarantee it 'll work . <p> If she 's skittish but cooperative , hand her the tape as soon as you 're finished , or destroy it once you 've had your fun with it . If it 's a keeper , lock it in a separate location , far from the VHS copies of Everybody Loves Raymond . <p> AT FIRST : " Try forgoing the tape , " says Royalle . She and her boyfriend did that after she retired from making porn . " We would hook the camera up directly to the TV , " she says , " bypassing any videotape or evidence , and be able to look over at ourselves in the heat of passion " Consider a safer still camera ( digital or Polaroid ) , which is less intimidating to beginners . <p> LATER : Sex is a beautiful thing to experience , but it can be tough to watch . " Never use overhead lighting , " says Royalle . " It creates shadows , and besides , overhead lights are just plain ugly . " Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that while men are visually stimulated , " women are more aural . As long as there are lots and lots of sounds , a woman can find the enjoyment . " <p> HER STORY : " My husband and I bought a digital camera for our trip to South America . He was playing around with it in the hotel one night , and I did a silly , sexy dance with my towel as I was getting out of the shower . When we watched it , I was pleasantly surprised : It was so beautiful and , frankly , kind of hot . That inspired us to set up the camera on the nightstand while we had sex . It looked great  --  the camera was far enough away to avoid any gross porno shots  --  and it was incredibly sexy to watch . I was bummed when we had to erase it for more space to record the Incan temples . "  --  Susan , 27 , engineer <p> ROLE PLAYING <p> I 'm not going to pretend that a self-respecting man could make it through this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a herculean suspension of disbelief  --  but so does watching Weird Science , and that does n't make the experience any less enjoyable . <p> Many popular roles ( boss/secretary , teacher/ student , stripper/customer ) play on the theme of " Someone is in control , and the other is at his or her mercy . " " These are strong dynamics , even in healthy and fun sexual relationships , " says Jean Mone , a New York City sex therapist . " They allow the woman and the man to enact their fantasies in a way that wo n't leave them feeling vulnerable . " <p> AT FIRST : This does n't have to extend outside the bedroom . " My boyfriend bought me lacy lingerie that 's unlike anything I 've ever worn , " says Brittany , 27 , a teacher . " It 's not my style at all , but when I wear it , I feel like a different person in bed  --  sexy , crazy , empowered . " <p> For a public thrill , go to a bar where neither of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to pick her up , pretending you 've never laid eyes on each other . If you can come up with a story line , go for it . Otherwise , have a name , occupation , and background in mind  --  and make it fun . Always wanted to blatantly hit on a hot stranger ? Now you can . " There 's something exciting about going public with our sexuality , " Birch says . <p> LATER : Tweak the bar trick . Wear clothes she has n't seen before and a different cologne , because the sense of smell is tied closely to memory . You want her to forget who you are . And if you 're used to the Four Seasons , try a Red Roof Inn . <p> Aim for euphoria , not hysteria . " It 's okay to laugh , but it 's also a good idea to feel like you 're in a sexy mode , " says Queen . " If the idea of putting on the pirate hat makes you giggle , bring the role play a little closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play a traveling salesman to her lonely stay-at-home wife . You 're not going for an Emmy here  --  just great sex . <p> HER STORY : " We did it as a goof , giggling when we first met at the bar . But after we realized how much the scenario was making the dynamic between us different , we quickly set the scene for some of the most memorable sex either of us has ever had . I always wanted to be a wanton slut but met my soul mate when I was young . The role play allowed me to show a different side of myself that both of us enjoyed . We summon my inner hussy on a monthly basis now ! "  --  Julia , 24 , graduate student <p> SEX TOYS <p> In a bit of unintelligent design , most sexual positions offer little clitoral stimulation , which women need to reach orgasm . Sex toys , then , are accoutrements you can both get excited about . She may well be using a vibrator already when you 're not around , so the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " Men worry that they 'll be replaced , or that she 'll become addicted and he 'll never be able to compete , " says Johanson , who , by the way , is a 70-something registered nurse . <p> AT FIRST : Start with bath and massage oils , suggests Mone . A scientist named Tricia , 28 , who admits to being uncomfortable with nontraditional sex , says , " Even I 'd be up for playing around with lubricants and body butter . " Then it 's your move : Package some oils , a toy , maybe some lingerie , and give it to her to peruse on her own time . ( Good Vibrations has a Friday Nite Delight kit with a bath ball , orange-mango body oil , massage lotion , **27;2514;TOOLONG body butter , and a Magic Touch minibullet vibrator ; $35 , goodvibes.com . ) Tell her to bring her new toys along whenever she 's ready . <p> LATER : The elusive simultaneous orgasm is more likely with the right accessories . " If a woman uses a vibrator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's inside her , " says Royalle . She recommends the Natural Contours Superbe ( $25 , natural-contours.com ) , which , though designed for mind-blowing sex , looks as sweet and innocent as they come ( ahem ) . When we took a group of nonkinky girls to Good Vibrations , they were drawn to the smaller " ticklers . " " They did n't intimidate me as much as the dildo-y-looking stuff , " says Carley . And for men ? They can work on you , too : " Once they get used to the idea , guys love vibrators , " says Johanson . " If she takes it and rubs it up the shaft of his penis very gently  --  around the shaft , over and around the head and testicles  --  that 's very stimulating . " Lube helps . <p> HER STORY : " My guy is really great in bed , but I just could n't come through sex alone . I really wanted us to experience orgasm simultaneously . When my boyfriend surprised me with a vibrator that looked more like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , and it was everything I thought it would be . "  --  Melissa 31 , accountant <p> EXHIBITIONISM <p> We 're talking all types : flashing , sex in a public place , sex in a private place with open drapes , wearing a skirt but no underwear . ( Um , meaning her . Generally . ) " The thrill of being viewed has a lot to do with getting attention , " says Queen . " For women , it 's a sort of centering experience that makes them realize they have attractiveness and erotic energy , even if they do n't look like Lindsay Lohan . " <p> AT FIRST : Go commando when you leave the house , with her in a skirt or dress . Throughout the evening , give each other a few quick , private shows . Use any opportunity  --  helping her with a pool shot , pressing up against each other as a concert lets out  --  to get all up in her business for a moment . " After a quickie , we were late meeting friends for drinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to forgo my underwear , " says Karen , a 25-year-old writer . " I 'd be talking to my friends or ordering a drink , and he 'd reach his hand up my skirt . It would n't have happened if the bar had n't been dark and we had n't been drunk , but I 'm so glad it did . " <p> LATER : Sex outdoors . " The fear of getting caught really wakes you up and focuses you on the sexual experience , " says Queen . " It also harks back to the thrill of sexual experiences as teenagers , when we had so little privacy . " Be strategic , and keep an eye out for Johnny Law . <p> HER STORY : " It was the hottest thing ever . This guy asked me to join him for a bottle of wine on the roof of his apartment building . One thing led to another , and before long , we were doing it standing up , my legs wrapped around him . I 'm a shy person , but it ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epitome of a law-abiding citizen . I think that made the vague threat of being caught all the more thrilling .
