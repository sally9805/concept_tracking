Do you know what you are singing , do you have any idea ? ANDERSON ( Reciting review ) Miss Anderson makes a a great mistake in venturing so quickly into Lieder . She has failed in her attempt by over extending herself . She would in my opinion be better served if she contented herself with singing the simple songs of her people . MOTHER Come on honey , you never mind them . ANDERSON ( Hiding ) I 'll wait on my mother 's house to heal me . I 'll not sing another note . ANDERSON ( Chases her ) We 're going to have to clean these people 's houses . ANDERSON I wo n't let them wound me again . MOTHER It 's all right dear .

MOTHER Well then , pay it . Trust yourself , and the one who made you . ANDERSON But they did this to me before . Promised me a theater which would be full . I remember New York ? They had me waiting with my heart . MR . KRUPP ( He wears a white suit ) Well , Miss Anderson , have you made your decision ? ANDERSON Five hundred dollars is a lot of money . Do you know what it means ? MR . KRUPP Yes , I think I do . ( He makes the universal gesture for money ) GELD ! ANDERSON It means the difference between six months in Europe or going back home and working . It means classes with a good instructor . Classes I could never get back home . It means . . . p. 25 MR . KRUPP The difference between the start of a real carreer and the dream of one . That 's what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this rented hall ? MR .

KRUPP Oh it is you who will fill it , even if they merely come from curiosity . Who is this girl with the skin of chocolate and the face of the divine ?

ANDERSON Yes , Schubert , Schumman and Spirituals . MR . KRUPP Let me go and make all ready ANDERSON And the critics ? MR . KRUPP Like flies to dung . They come to see you fail . But wish you well . This is how they make their living . Now , you make yourself more beautiful and I will see to the house . ( Marian dresses behind silk screen .

ANDERSON Is absolutely everyone in Germany so perverse . MR . KRUPP It 's not only Germany . Perhaps the entire world is Germany that 's why they hate us so . But trust me when I tell you that the public like diva-goddessess especially chocolate ones . But a goddess must be untouchable so never let them get too close .

You have that devious look in your eyes though . What 's up ? HUROK Whatever do you mean , devious look ? ANDERSON ( Pointing ) That devious look . The one that makes me thankful that I 'm your client and not your rival . HUROK I Think it 's time we change venues , Marian . ANDERSON Change venues , why ? HUROK You know you have this tour coming up in Washington , right . I think it 's time we try something more than colleges . ANDERSON Meaning ?

Now what can they say when faced with the colored icon Marian Anderson ? ( Walks around behind her and whispers again for emphasis ) An Icon . ANDERSON How about : " No " HUROK Of course they 'd like to do a polite discrete no , but what if we do n't accept that ? ( The chorus become the D.A.R . The Daughters of The American Revolution . ) ANDERSON The hems of their dresses are so white . p. 43 HUROK Who ? ANDERSON The Daughters Of the Revolution . HUROK I wonder who washes their dirty clothes ? ANDERSON We do . My mother and people like her . HUROK Then do n't you think it 's time you stopped them ? ANDERSON But I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do is to live quietly and sing my music . HUROK Listen my dear Marian , let me tell you something if you want to live quietly then do n't choose music . You want quiet than go sing in a church choir for God 's sake . But you did n't do all this work and travel half way around the world just to end up in some church in Washington did you ? ANDERSON No . I did n't . HUROK So stop telling me about quiet . If my father chose quiet we 'd still be in Russia somewhere being trampled to death by Cossacks in some Pogram . You ca n't get more quiet than the grave , believe me . ANDERSON I believe you . HUROK Or you could have just stayed in Philidelphia . It closes at nine . You 're talking quiet ? ANDERSON Hey stop making fun of my city . p. 44 HUROK Well ? ANDERSON I do n't want to have to war with newspapper men . HUROK Newspapers spell money .

I would like to book a date at your hall for Miss Marian Anderson . Yes , Marian Anderson , Yes the colored singer . I was thinking of perhaps April what do you have available . . . oh what a pity . How about May . . . June . . . July then ( Laughs ) I see well tell me just when do you think you might have a free date ? Oh maybe two years I see . . . Thank you so much . Oh I ' ll be in touch . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Sketch for Eleanor Roosevelt ( The Blue room of the White House . Marian is awaiting the arrival of Eleanor Roosevelt who has invited her as her special guest . marian nervous , stands and then sits ) ANDERSON " T was brillig , and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe All mimsy were the borogoves And the mome raths outgrabe . " ( Pauses ) God , I wonder should I curtsey when she enters the room . And if I do n't will she cut off my head ? ( Eleanor Roosevelt enters like a worldwind . She removes hat and approaches Marian who stands and shakes the hand which is offered to her ) ELEANOR ROOSEVELT And so to you Miss Anderson , please forgive my tardiness . I do so hate to keep anyone waiting but in this instance it was impossible to avoid . A radio interview . As you know radio is very important to us . The newspapers seem determine to brand us as Communist sympathizers because we introduced Social Security . Radio is the only way we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't keep you waiting too long . ANDERSON Oh not at all . I must tell you that my mother loves you . ELEANOR ROOSEVELT Really ? p. 46 ANDERSON Oh absolutely . Anytime you or Mr. Roosevelt speak on the radio she makes the whole neighborhood listen . ELEANOR ROOSEVELT Bless her . ( Pause ) Listen about the cancellation of your concert I must tell you how terrribly sorry I am . I know it must have been devastating for you but please realize that it was not a personal rejection of you or your talent . It was purely based on fear . ANDERSON Fear ? ELEANOR ROOSEVELT Oh absolutely . The D.A.R. , The daughters of the Revolution , of which by the way I am no longer a member . . . ANDERSON Yes , I heard that you resigned , I 'm sorry that I caused . . . ELEANOR ROOSEVELT Please , it had more to do with myself than you , believe me . We were bound to come to a parting of the ways . I 'm afaraid that they as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for something . Courage I think . Now it 's only racism and dress balls . ANDERSON So you think it 's me that they fear so much ? ELEANOR ROOSEVELT Not you , the audience you attract . They fear that black and white may sit together . ANDERSON And so ? This is Washington , not the South . p. 47 ELEANOR ROOSEVELT Believe me in some ways , Washington is more South than the South . Trust me . ANDERSON I had n't realized . ELEANOR ROOSEVELT We see only what we need to and edit the rest . We all do it . For example , look at my husband , Franklin . The American people could never stand to see him as a cripple so they do n't . Ask anyone and they 'll tell you he walks . They see niether the wheelchair nor the crutches . They need a strong president so . . . ANDERSON They see one . ELEANOR ROOSEVELT Marian , you 're so beautiful . ANDERSON Why . . . thank you . ELEANOR ROOSEVELT I 've always felt awkward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , you 're very . . . lovely . ELEANOR ROOSEVELT Please , by no streach am I lovely . Franklin says what I may lack in beauty I match in strength . He 's very diplomatic , Franklin he was born to be a politician . In anycase beauty was not what he married me for . ( Pause ) He has others for that . ( Marian sees the pain and sadness on Eleanor 's face and extends her hand toward her but stops suddenly ) p. 48 ELEANOR ROOSEVELT Well now , you did n't come here to speak about me . Let 's see to you shall we . I think we might have a solution to the problem of your 're being banned from the singing at Constitution Hall . ANDERSON Solution ? ELEANOR ROOSEVELT Yes , fortuneately the Secretary of the Interior , Mr. Ickies , is also head of parks . ANDERSON And so ? ELEANOR ROOSEVELT Well fortunately he 's on our side in this . There is in fact the Lincoln Monument which comes technically undr the aegis of the parks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANDERSON At the momument ? ELEANOR ROOSEVELT No my dear , before the monument . Before it ( As she speaks she leads Marian by the hand and chorus place a fur coat about Marian 's shoulders . The lighting transforms and we suddenly find ourselves at the Monument . We hear the first chorus of My Country T'is Of Thee . The music then changes to Shubert 's Ave Maria ) p. 49 Act 2 , Scene 3 : The Proposal ( Orpheus Fischer approaches Marian after concert . He waits patiently while her adoring public ( chorus ) surround her ) FISHER ORPHEUS Well ? ANDERSON Well what ? FISHER ORPHEUS You said if I waited until your career was secure we could marry . ANDERSON I may have I do n't recall . And so ? FISHER ORPHEUS Well it 's hardly going to get more secure than the Lincoln Monument is it . So . . . ? ANDERSON Yeah but you did n't wait did you ? You went and got yourself married , you even tried to pass for white . FISHER ORPHEUS ( Slaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Laughing ) You think it 's funny , well it 's not . You almost broke my heart . FISHER ORPHEUS You never told me . You acted as if it did n't matter to you . How long did you expect me to just sit there with my hand in my pockets ? Anyway that 's all over now . You were the only one I ever really loved . ANDERSON That did n't stop you from playing around did it ? Why should I even trust you ? p. 50 FISHER ORPHEUS Because Orpheus made the sun rise . ANDERSON So where 's my castle ? You said you were going to build me a castle Mr. Architect ? FISHER ORPHEUS You just say yes , I 'll build you your castle . ANDERSON So what comes first , the yes or the castle ? FISHER ORPHEUS Try yes and come . ( He holds her to him ) . ANDERSON I should have never let you in my garden .

The occasion iis a visit of Alyse and Mother ) ANDERSON Well Alyse this is your first time coming to vist us here on the farm . I do n't know what on earth took you so long . ANDERSON Well sorry , I 'm not really a country kind of girl . I figure as hard as mother worked to get us away from cotton picking it does n't make any sense working on some farm . Give me a city any day . ANDERSON It does make a difference if it 's your own and you 're not just share cropping , know what I mean ? ANDERSON I guess . . ANDERSON You did n't even come to the wedding . ANDERSON Why , what do you get the couple who have everything ? ANDERSON How about just giving the gift of your presence ? ANDERSON Oh , something tells me I was n't terrible missed , Not really , in fact there might have been a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's very lovely here Marian . So peacefull . ANDERSON Its country .

Yes I guess so . You got so may bills to pay . ( Mother gives Alyse a look ) MOTHER So where 's my son in law ? ANDERSON Oh he 's out back chopping wood for the fire . He 's really gotten into farming . ANDERSON I guess he might as well , since he married you he has n't got any jobs in architecture has he ? MOTHER Alyse ! ANDERSON Well amI wrong ? If so tell me . His careeer ended once he married you . ANDERSON Tell me something Al ; yse , so you really go out of your way to be disgusting or does it just come naturally ? ANDERSON Oh , you mean like telling the truth ? Come on you know you pay all the bills and this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One look and he knows that they 've been discussing him ) FISHER ORPHEUS You rang ?

Why hello Orpheus , farming ? p. 53 FISHER ORPHEUS You know Ayse , you 've made it fairly clear that I am not your favorite person in this world . Fair enough perhaps , just perhaps you 're not mine either . You weren't terrible happy when I married into this family but the fact is that I did . ( He holds Marian in his arms defiantly ) So sister in law lets at least try and keep it civil if nothing else . Do n't disrespect in my home . We do n't need that , we have enough neihbors who would like to lynch us right here in Connecicut the Yankeee capital of the world . ANDERSON Really I thought everybody loved Marian Anderson . FISHER ORPHEUS Marian Anderson , not her husband . Anysway do n't bother trying to insult me . I 'm better at it than you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm from Washngton . In the shadow of the White House . ANDERSON What does that mean exactly ? FISHER ORPHEUS It means I may look light but I 'm still black . To black to get hired for government contracts . Your better off being dark skinned because at least you know you have no choice . Me , the temptations always there to hide when it 's easier . You know you are , I had to find out . It took me longer to get there but thank God I made it . Who knows , Alyse , if you were me , you might still be running . So . . . do n't judge me . I ai n't going nowhere . Sis .

WAITRESS No , Ave Maria . ANDERSON How quaint . Well good luck . WAITRESS Thank you . FISHER ORPHEUS We do n't have to stay long if you do n't want to but I think we should at least make an appearance after all Hurok did invite us . ANDERSON Alright , just as long as we can leave early , we have a long drive back to Danbury . These people and their parties . They 'll never even know that we left ( A man approaches ) p. 55 BING Hello Marian , forgive me for intruding , I 'm Rudolph Bing , I do n't believe we 've been introduced .

BING Did I say something amusing ? Perhaps we should talk tomorrow . . . ( Turns away suddenly and takes her husband 's arm ) FISHER ORPHEUS Is something wrong ? ANDERSON Take me away before I slap his face . FISHER ORPHEUS What 's wrong , did he insult you ? ANDERSON All my life , all my life I wanted only one thing . To sing Opera . They did everything they could to stop me . I had to crawl all over the world . . . and now at fifty . . . he walks over to me at a cocktail party . It 's so easy for them . Just like asking for a dance . Where the hell was he when I was 20 , even 30 ? But now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice is still beautiful . ANDERSON Oh shut up . You 're as ridiculous as he is . Take me home . ( She exits ) p. 57 Act 2 , Scene 6 : The Decision ( Marian is staring into mirror . She draws back , her hair and checks first one side of her face in profile than the other . The mirror is in actuality another dancer from the chorus who mimics her movements ) . ANDERSON They lie . They tell you what they think you want to hear . Marian , you 're still young . You never sounded better . Even mother lies . She just wants her daughter to sing at the Met. The only one who tells the truth is Alyse . And that 's only because she hates me . ( Sister appears in background ) SISTER Well just as long as they do n't ask you to do the lead in Carmen , you can get away with it . ANDERSON What a sense of humor God has . . . or is it the devil ? Now they say they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swift graceful balletic movement in the background . Marian rises and tries to copy her but loses her balance ) ANDERSON You see . Too old . I always wanted to be a dancer . But my feet and hands would n't let me but then he gave a voice so that I could dance away from this world . I thought . . . But those first days in Germany . I remember the night Toscanini enetered and said : ( Toscanini appears ) p. 58 TOSCANINI A voice such as yours is heard only once every hundred years , my dear . ( He kisses her hand ) NUNC DIMITIS . Lord , let your servant now depart in peace . ( He exits ) ANDERSON Mother , I guess I should n't complain . How many have memories such as that ? ( Enter Orpheus . He knocks ) FISHER ORPHEUS May I come in ? ANDERSON No . Go away . FISHER ORPHEUS You know I 've never seen you act so childish . ANDERSON You 're not the one who has to go out on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had some waitress tell me that her mother named her after hearing one of my performances . You know how that made me feel ? FISHER ORPHEUS Honoured , if you had sense . ANDERSON No , just old . You can stay home safely and play with your cardboard boxes and crayons and call yourself an architect . FISHER ORPHEUS Listen woman I sacrificed my career for you . ANDERSON ( Still in mirror ) What career ? FISHER ORPHEUS You can really be brutal when you want to . That 's not the ebony angel that the world knows . I gave up everything to take care of you . Everything . Followed you all over the world . Who the hell knows Marian Anderson 's husband ? p. 59 ANDERSON That 's not my fault . FISHER ORPHEUS Yes it is . You refused even to change your name . Who am I Mr. Anderson ? No , no that 's your father , the Ice Man . But he was dark . ANDERSON What is it you want ? FISHER ORPHEUS Marian , staring in the mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to retire . I have enough money . No need to make myself a laughing stock . I 'm not going to go out there on stage . FISHER ORPHEUS Alright . It 's your decision , your career . As you made sure to let me know , at least you have one . ANDERSON I 'm sorry I. . . I did n't mean it . FISHER ORPHEUS Yes you did , you always mean exactly what you say . Like when you told me that your career was going to come before anything . Marriage , children . . . me . Your nephew 's here . He wants to see you . ANDERSON De Priest DE PRIEST Hello Aunt Marian . I 'm not going to try and force you to perform if you finally decide you 've had enough . Just remember one thing though . ANDERSON What 's that ? DE PRIEST You quit now and they 'll have won . You 'll never know for sure if you were good enough for the Met. p. 60 ANDERSON You think I care what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get in then they 'll let in some others after you . You 're the reason I became a conductor . Somebody 's got to be first . Did you go through all of that for nothing ? Take it . It 's yours . Just like Canaan . ( He exits .
