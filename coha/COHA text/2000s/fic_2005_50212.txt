AFTER THE ACCIDENT , Annie was all I had left . She had a limp , she had a scar down the right side of her face that her hair could n't quite cover , and sometimes she had a look in her eyes that worried me - not quite frightened , resigned . <p> Six-year-old girls were supposed to be happy spring butterflies , bouncing from one bright-colored moment to the next . But the giggles of the season were silent . Annie sat alone in her room , holding her doll , . the one with the smashed face , and stared at the wall . Not even out the window . <p> The doctors said she needed time , that was all . She 'd been through a lot , and she still missed her mother - but she 'd come back to life eventually . When she was ready . <p> But nobody 's ever ready for anything . I knew that . I was n't ready to be a widower at thirty-three . <p> I sat down next to Annie and put my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but neither did she relax . She let me pull her close , but she was still a little zombie . I leaned over and sniffed her hair , kissed the top of her head , and whispered into her ear , " Have I told you today how much I love you ? " She did n't respond . <p> Out of frustration , as much as anything else , I scooped her up and held her on my lap , hugged her close . " You 're my favorite kid in the whole wide world and that 's never going to change . " I stroked her hair . " Listen to me , sweetheart . I know it hurts . I miss her too . But maybe we can help each other . You know how I come in here and talk to you about what I 'm feeling ? Well , maybe sometimes if you wanted to talk to me , maybe you could do that and maybe that would help a little bit . What do you think ? " <p> Not even a nod . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this , she seemed unreachable . Words like traumatized and catatonic and withdrawn all flashed through my head , but I hated those words - because the way that people used them , they stopped being descriptions , they became explanations . They turned into life sentences . <p> " Okay , sweetheart , I 'm not going to force you . When you 're ready , you come see me , okay ? Just say Okay . ' Okay ? " <p> " Okay , " she whispered . And that was enough . Not quite a breakthrough , but certainly the possibility of one . <p> " I 'm going to go make dinner now . Let 's have something special . Just for us . What would you like ? I 'll make your favorite . " <p> " Pancakes . " <p> " Pancakes for dinner ? Okay , that sounds fun . And bacon too ? Will you come help ? " <p> In this case , help meant sitting silently on her chair while I flipped pancakes on the griddle . When I put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move to eat . " Did n't I do them right ? " <p> " Daddy , I 'm scared . " <p> " Of my pancakes ? " <p> " No . Do n't be silly . " <p> " Okay . " At least she was talking . " What aie you scared of ? " <p> " Going to sleep . " <p> " Going to sleep ? " <p> " I 'm afraid ... ! wo n't wake up . " <p> My first instinct was to say , " That 's silly . Everybody wakes up . " But I stopped myself in time , because that was n't true . We both knew that . So instead , I just nodded knowingly . " Yeah , that is scary . " I had a dozen questions I wanted to ask , but I did n't want to push too hard . It was more important that she knew it was safe to talk . <p> I reached over and began cutting her pancakes for her . She could do it , but before the accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say " I like the way you do it , Daddy . " But today , she pushed my hands away and said , " I 'll do it myself . " <p> " Okay . " I sat down opposite her and busied myself with my own plate . I was n't very hungry , but I went through the motions anyway , waiting for her to go on . <p> " There 's this thing in my dream , " she said very matter-of-factly . <p> " What kind of thing ? " <p> " I do n't know . It 's too dark and fuzzy to see . It 's all flickery . It comes from underneath . " <p> " Underneath ? " <p> " Uh-uh . Underneath . " <p> " Underneath what ? " <p> " Underneath everything . " <p> " Okay . What does it do ? " <p> " Nothing . " <p> " Nothing ? " Very carefully , not wanting to put her off , I said , " I do n't know , Annie . That does n't sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is . " <p> " Why ? " <p> " Because it 's there . " She pushed a piece of pancake around on her plate , mopping up syrup . She still had n't eaten a bite . " It 's even there in the daytime . Only I ca n't see it , because it 's always behind me . " <p> " Now , that sounds scary . " <p> " It is . " <p> " Mmm , " I said . " We 're definitely going to have to do something about this . " <p> " You ca n't . " <p> " I ca n't ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Why not ? " <p> " Because it 's from underneath . " <p> " I see . That is serious . Tell me , who 's bigger ? You or it ? " <p> She did n't answer . <p> " I 'll bet I 'm bigger .... " <p> Still no reply . <p> " Well , certainly the two of us together are big enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to try something else . How do you fight magical thinking ? With stronger magic . <p> " I know what 'll work . " <p> She looked up at me . " What ? " <p> " A dreamcatcher . " <p> " What 's a dreamcatcher ? " <p> " Just what it sounds like . Take a bite of that pancake and I 'll tell you more . " <p> She did and I did . I did n't remember everything , so I made up what I did n't know . " A dreamcatcher is like a net for your dreams . You hang it over your bed and it catches all your bad dreams . Like a spaghetti strainer . And when it 's full , you throw it out and make a new one . " <p> Annie looked skeptical . <p> " It 's an old Indian trick . I learned it from an old Indian . We 'll make a dreamcatcher as soon as you finish dinner . We 'll need some yarn and some feathers and maybe some sequins too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oops . For a moment , she was almost interested , but as soon as I said Mommy , Annie shut down again . If only I had n't opened my big mouth . If only . <p> If only I had n't tried to make the light <p> I got up and went to the sink . I started scrubbing the griddle in fast ferocious movements , furious at myself for having a big mouth , for being stupid , for everything . <p> " That 's okay , Daddy . We can still do it . Mommy wo n't mind . " <p> I stopped myself . I nodded curtly . Maybe Annie was n't the only one who needed strong magic . <p> Annie picked out her favorite colors of yarn , and I found some dowels in the garage , left over from my kite-building period . We tied three of the dowels together to make a triangle , then strung a clumsy webwork of braided yarn and plastic beads across the center . We pulled bright-colored feathers out of Mommy 's Halloween boa , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s to each corner . We hung more feathers and beads from the bottom . Then we said some magic words over it and hung it on the wall over Annie 's bed . " There . That 'll catch all your bad dreams . Or my name is n't Mortimer Chuzzlefinger . " <p> " Da-addy ! " I had n't heard that pronunciation in a while , with all the extra syllables. 1 had n't realized how much I 'd missed it . <p> " Oh , I forgot . My name is n't Mortimer Chuzzlefinger . But do n't worry about it . This will still catch all your bad dreams . Snout 's Honor . Now go brush your teeth and put on your nightie . " <p> Annie went without argument . She did n't bounce , she limped . She had turned into a serious little soul . I missed my little girl , the one who giggled . I wondered if I 'd ever hear her laugh again . I tucked her into bed and hugged her tightly . She accepted it , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The difference between human beings and coyotes is that when the Acme Rocket-Launcher blows up in the coyote 's face , he does n't lose heart . He just goes back to the Acme catalog and orders something else . Human beings never recover from that first awful explosion . We might not walk around with our hair sticking out in charred frizzles and a scorched look of stunned amazement , but we never really regain our trust in a safe and orderly universe either . Once suspicious , we remain suspicious . That 's what murders childhood innocence . <p> I looked in on Annie several times that night . She appeared to be sleeping soundly . The dreamcatcher was on the wall over her headboard where we 'd carefully hung it . When she was little , I used to sit and watch her sleep , amazed that any little human being could be so beautiful , even more amazed that I could be so totally committed to protecting her from harm . I 'd always thought of myself as self-involved to the point of selfishness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All I could think about was her smile , the trusting way she slipped her hand into mine , the giggles and laughter . Everything else was ... just stuff . I finally went to bed , hopeful that maybe the dreamcatcher was a way to start again . <p> But early the next morning , even before the sun was up , she came to me crying . " Daddy , the dreamcatcher did n't work - " <p> I followed her back to her room , where she pointed at the wall . Our carefully constructed webwork had been shredded . The dowels were broken and the netting we 'd strung had been pulled apart . For a moment , I had the distinct impression that something had fought its way out . I started to say , " Why did you break it - ? " then stopped myself . This was n't the time for accusations . I scooped her up instead , hugged her , stroked her hair , and whispered , " Wow . That was some bad dream . We 're going to need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would n't look . <p> Later , after she was dressed , after she had gone outside to sit under the tree to talk with her stuffed penguin , I took the shredded construction off the wall and examined it . The feathers we 'd tied to the corners were all chewed , but not soggy-chewed like a child might do - ragged-chewed as if by the teeth of rats . The dowels too had the same tiny teeth marks . The yarn we 'd tied and strung to make a dream-net had been stretched and pulled apart . And for a moment , I wondered if this might be something more than just a child 's bad dreams . I even pulled her bed away from the wall and went looking for holes in the baseboard . Nothing . Nothing at all . <p> I tossed the shredded dreamcatcher into the trash , where Annie would n't see it , and wondered if I should make another one . But why would Annie rip it apart ? Some deeper , darker thing we had n't gotten to yet ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while , I went out to the garage . We had three old tennis rackets that we 'd bought at a yard sale for five dollars . I had some metal rods and some nylon fishing line , an old bicycle wheel , and even some piano wire . I could make an industrial strength dreamcatcher , one she could n't destroy . Maybe I could show her that Daddy was still bigger and stronger than the worst bad dreams she could imagine . That might work . <p> With the garage door open , I could keep an eye on her while I worked . I started with the three tennis rackets . I used the piano wire to tie them together , with their heads at the center and the handles sticking out at angles , and sprayed the whole affair with shiny black enamel . After they dried , I attached this construction to the bicycle wheel . Now it needed some decoration . <p> I found what was left of an old kite , a nine-foot-long strip of silver mylar that rippled in the sun ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wound it around the rim and the spokes of the bicycle wheel . I burrowed into the Christmas decorations and found a box of tinsel and another box of silvery snowflake ornaments . I stapled the tinsel to the handles of the tennis rackets , and attached the snowflakes to the nylon webbing at the sweet spot . When I was done , the whole thing was a pretty ghastly affair - but enormously sturdy , you could carry a bowling ball on it . It was a very serious-looking dreamcatcher . <p> When I called Annie to the garage to see the new dreamcatcher , she stared at it with an appraiser 's eye . Finally , she said , " Okay . " But it was n't a signal of affirmation , it was an " okay " of resignation . Yesterday , she had been hopeful , willing to believe . After last night , she was neither . <p> All right , I had to think about this . Building the second dreamcatcher had been useful . It was something to do with my hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real problem Annie 's belief that there was something underneath that wanted to get to her . I remembered the chapters about " magical thinking . " Annie needed to believe in something stronger . We all did . That was the essential part of being human . So after dinner , we hung up the dreamcatcher and lit a pink candle and waved feather dusters at it and said some magical words - " By the power of Great Ghu , the God of the Ceiling , let this dreamcatcher be a barrier to all and everything that wishes harm to this household and all who live here . " - but Annie 's dispirited " okay " reduced the whole thing to a silly performance . If she did n't believe , it would n't work . She was at that age where children start to give up belief . So who knew ? <p> " Daddy ? " <p> " Yes , sweetheart ? " <p> " Will you sleep with me tonight ? Mommy always slept with me when I had bad dreams . " <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeping with children - but this was Annie and this was serious medicine , so I said , " Of course , I will . " <p> I tucked her in carefully , then lay down next to her on top of the covers . She snuggled up next to me , pressing her back against my side . She was asleep almost immediately . That was a relief ; neither one of us had been sleeping all that well . Not since the accident . The endless cycling of memory had become a chronic pummeling . There was no peace . The slightest noise or irritation and I 'd be up . The one person I most needed to talk to was the person who was n't here . Maybe that was what Annie was feeling . But for just this little moment , maybe we could almost pretend that everything was going to be all right . Except I knew better . <p> The limp , the scar - when Annie was a teenager , these would be almost impenetrable barriers between her and everybody else . These things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Girls used gossip and manipulation for bullying - little games when they were little , horrendous games when they grew bigger . Sometimes , in the way they interacted , you could see them training to be future harpies , honing the pernicious skills of ripping out the hearts of the innocent . Annie was already self-conscious about her wounds ; her teen years would be hell . I 'd asked about cosmetic surgery , physical therapy , orthopedic repair , but the doctors said there was n't a lot they could do now , maybe later . But later might be too late . Her spirit was crippled too . <p> Eventually , I fell into an uneasy sleep , a swirl of disturbing dreams . Urgent dreams . I had to hide . I had to find a safe place , the safest . I hurried downstairs , down an escalator , down and down - at the bottom , I rushed around a corner , around a corner , ducked under the angle of the rolling stairs , down again , through a narrow hallway and down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I ducked behind some boxes - I found a tiny opening , a vent ; no , not even that , just a narrow nook underneath the floorboards , I crawled sideways around an impossible angle , down into a deeper space , dark and bottomless , I climbed down the metal ladder , down and down , always downward , until I found the hatch into the pipes below the city - I padded through the dank underbelly of the world , sloshing through tubes illuminated by phantom iridescence , climbing into narrower and narrower pipes , until I found another ladder down , this one leading to ancient stone tunnels , maybe catacombs , I could n't tell , except after a while , the walls were pulsing , lined with throbbing purple veins and bulbous growths , and farther down , cracks appeared in the walls , glowing red as embers , it was warm here , too warm , uncomfortably hot , molten lava seeping up through the floor , the edges of the rocky crust were limned with flame , I had to jump across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come so far that I would never find my way back ? I knew this place . There was something here . Behind me . I turned around and <p> Woke up with a startled grunt . My heart pounding . <p> I fumbled around for my flashlight , the big heavy one filled with a half-dozen D-cells . Held overhand , it could be used as a club . If necessary . I 'd put it on the nightstand next to Annie 's bed so she could look to see that there were no monsters in the dark . I clicked it on myself . Yes , there were no monsters . I was actually relieved . <p> Padded off to the bathroom , fever dreams still resonant . Checked the thermostat . Opened the front door and sniffed the night . Thought about going to my own bed . Thought about a lot of things . Three o'clock in the morning thoughts . All the way down to the bottom one - why does the universe even exist ? Why is there something instead of nothing ? <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coffee , still sitting cold in the carafe ; gave it a short ride in the microwave , then returned to Annie 's room . I stood in the doorway , sipping half-heartedly at the bitter brew until it was cold and tasteless . I did n't want to get back into her bed . It was uncomfortable . But I did n't want to leave her alone either . <p> We had a big overstuffed chair in the den . I 'd fallen asleep in it more than once , usually during some made-for-TV movie on the Lifetime channel . I pushed the chair into Annie 's room , grabbed a pillow and a comforter , and made myself as comfortable as I could . I moved as quietly as I could through the darkness . I was n't planning on staying up all night , watching , but if anything made a sound , I 'd be right here . Just before settling in , I flicked on the flashlight , one last time , just to check , I do n't know what made me do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . My carefully constructed industrial-strength dreamcatcher had been chewed to bits , as if something with metal teeth had gnawed its way out . I lifted it off the hook on the wall , astonished and shaking my head and for the first time , honestly worried . Even a little scared . <p> Carried it into the kitchen and laid it on the counter . The fluorescent lights flickered on , momentarily dazzling me . What the bloody hell - ? The bicycle spokes were pulled every which way , the rim of the wheel was bent ; the nylon webbing of the tennis rackets was unstrung , with bent and broken strands pointing out at odd angles . It looked as if someone or something had deliberately picked it apart . <p> All right , there had to be a rational explanation . Maybe it was the tension of the wires , maybe I 'd strung the whole thing so tight it had unraveled in the middle of the night . Except I had n't heard a sound . My sleep had been so uncertain these past few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me bolt upright in bed . I could n't imagine this thing twanging apart above my head without my hearing something . Unless I 'd been so tired , so exhausted , so lost in sleep , so down in the dream - could the sound of this thing pulling itself apart have triggered my dreams of descent- ? Underneath ! <p> No . I was n't ready to go there yet . I 'd read articles about " unexplainable " phenomena that occurred at the nexus of standing waves - electrical , radio , sonic , whatever . Maybe this was like the guy who could hear the six o'clock news on his fillings ? Yes , he had voices in his head , but it was only the local Ted Baxter . I tried to remember what I 'd read about countermeasures . Put a large bowl of water next to an open window . Hang tinfoil strips . Rearrange the furniture . Install a ground wire . It all sounded like more dreamcatcher stuff . Just another belief system . <p> I was n't going to figure it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plopped down next to her again . She snuggled into my arm and two blinks later , sunlight was streaming in through the window , illuminating the dust motes like bars of blue silver . I glanced over , saw she was sleeping peacefully , so I eased myself out of bed and went into the kitchen to start breakfast . <p> Eventually , Annie wandered in , still rubbing her eyes . <p> " How 'd you sleep , sweetheart ? " <p> " Okay , I guess . " <p> " No bad dreams ? " <p> " Uh-uh . " And then she said , perceptively . " You had the bad dream for me , did n't you ? " <p> " Yeah , I guess I did . " <p> " Was it as bad as I said ? " <p> I nodded . " Yeah , I can see why you were scared . " <p> She glanced at the broken dreamcatcher . " That did n't work , did it ? " <p> " I guess not . " I started flipping pancakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> We spent the day running errands , dropping things off , picking things up , maintaining all the separate machineries of suburbia . Annie did n't fuss , - she held my hand and stayed close . I wished there was something I could do for her , some way I could pull her out of the shell she was building - something to distract her from her morbid fantasies of underneath . <p> A thought had been gnawing at me all morning . Annie was lonely . That 's all . She had no one to belong to anymore . No one to trust . And no matter how hard I tried , I could n't break through to her ; there was a part of her she was going to keep to herself now . <p> Inevitably , she pulled me over to the pet store window . She always liked looking at the puppies . So did I - except while she was fussing about each little cute furry personality , I was feeling sorry for them , locked in those enclosures , those cages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unable to run and play and bark . <p> And always , the inevitable question , " Daddy , can we get a puppy ? Puh-leeeeese ? Look , this one 's only sixty dollars . " <p> I peered close . Only sixty dollars for twenty-four months . " Uh-uh , sweetheart . Not one of these . " <p> " Why not- ? " <p> " Um , because - " WAy not ? " - because , these are n't good watch-dogs . " <p> " Why do we need a watchdog - ? " <p> " Because I ca n't sleep with you every night . We need a special kind of watchdog - a dream watchdog . A little pooch to snuggle up next to you and not let any bad dreams get in. ust like I did . " <p> " Oh . " She considered it . I could see her turning the thought over in her head . " Well , where do we get a dream watchdog ? " <p> " Mmm , well , I du n no .... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been talking about a puppy , maybe for Christmas , but what with one thing and another , including a new baby on the way - we 'd decided to wait a year , until Annie was bigger . Now , however , maybe a dog was just the right thing . <p> " I know - let 's go to the animal shelter . I 'll bet they have good dream dogs there . " Annie grabbed my hand and started pulling . I let myself be led back toward the parking lot . By the time we got to the car , Annie was already making plans for her pound-puppy . " I 'll give him my blue blanket , okay ? And he 'll sleep on my bed with me , okay ? And I 'll call him - um , what 's a good name for a dream watchdog , Daddy ? " <p> " Well , it 's been my experience that you have to live with a dog for three days , and at the end of three days , you 'll know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That sounds good . " <p> The animal shelter is a depressing place . It 's clean , the dogs are all well-cared for , the staff is friendly and helpful - but you know , going in , that there are n't enough homes for all these imploring hopeful faces . Only the young ones , the cute ones , the healthy ones are likely to find homes where they 'll be loved . Annie limped in behind me and I realized again that she was no longer one of the cute or healthy ones . People would look at her , and then to me , and I could see the flicker of pity behind their eyes - that poor man , having that poor disfigured child . <p> The puppy cages were closest to the entrance . There were n't many to choose from . A scruffy and scraggly-looking lot . Except <p> " Daddy , how about this one ? " <p> " He 's awfully small - " <p> " Oh , no - he 's just the right size . " <p> The card on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight months old . To my eyes , he looked like he was half poodle , half opportunist ; but his tail was bobbed . That indicated breeding , perhaps for show . Silvery fur , darker on top ; not quite curly - kinky . He was all dreadlocks . He needed grooming . I did n't think there was very much dog inside all that fur , but he had bright attentive eyes . He watched us both , his gaze flicking back and forth between Annie and myself , then finally fixing on her as the most likely mark . He stood up , putting his paws against the bars , and tried to shove his tiny muzzle through , his tongue already licking toward , Annie 's fingers . She held out her hand the way I 'd showed her , the back of the hand so the dog could sniff without being able to nip . He skipped the sniff , went right for the lick - this little pooch was people-friendly . More than that , he was desperate to be let out of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a familiar one . This was last year 's Christmas present to somebody , maybe somebody 's child and now they 'd gotten tired of it , and so they discarded it , tossing it away as if it had no feelings of its own . This frantic little hairball had invested his whole being-ness into belonging to someone who could n't be bothered to repay loyalty in kind . He had to be feeling confusion and hurt and fear . I hunched down on my knees and offered my own hand . " What do you think , little guy ? Do you think you can stand guard over my Annie here and keep her safe from bad dreams ? " It was an awfully big responsibility for such a little dog . He could n't have weighed very much . Six , maybe seven pounds . I wondered if he was too small , if he 'd be a yappy little nuisance ; was that why he 'd been abandoned to the system ? <p> But there 's this about dogs . When you look into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then it 's just a dog , - but if you see a little furry person there , then he 's part of your family , take him home . I was n't sure about this guy , yet - but there was something very alive and real behind those eyes . " Do you like this one , Annie ? " <p> " Oh , yes , Daddy . Very much . " And then , she stopped herself . " Will he be a good dream dog ? " <p> " Well - he 's a terrier . And terriers are good at catching rats . So he should be a good watchdog for bad dreams . Let 's go see if we can adopt him . " <p> There was a lot of paperwork , more than I expected , and it took a while . Annie quickly grew impatient , which under other circumstances would have annoyed me , but I was secretly pleased to see her so excited , so I told her to go wait by the cage and keep her new puppy company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know her . " Talk to him and let him know we 're paying his bail . " She did n't get the joke , but that was okay , she went anyway . <p> By the time I finished , Annie was sitting on the floor in front of the cage with the puppy happily curled in her lap . A thoughtful attendant had arranged it . " His name is Chester , " she announced . <p> " Chester , huh - ? " The little guy 's ears pricked up and he cocked his head at me . <p> " See ? He already knows his name . Are we done ? Can we take Chester home now ? " <p> " Sure , we can . " I reached out and let the little guy sniff my hand . He licked my fingers happily . Hell , if I 'd been locked up in one of these cages , I 'd have licked a few fingers to be let out too . <p> On the way home , we stopped at the local Petco for dog food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shampoo , flea and tick treatment , a nametag , a chew bone , a couple of small squeaky toys , a box of dog cookies , and a pet bed - a blue velvet pillow , impossibly decadent . " But he wo n't need his own bed , Daddy - he 's going to sleep with me . " <p> " Yes , sweetheart , but he still needs a bed of his own for his aftersnoon nap . Dogs like to have their own special places , just like people . " The total bill was over one hundred and fifty dollars , and we still were n't through . We still had to have doggie shots . <p> Annie spent the rest of the day showing Chester around the house and the yard , carefully explaining everything to him . " This corner of the back yard , this is where you poop . This is the kitchen , this is where we 'll feed you dinner . This is my room , this is your bed here - " Chester dutifully sniffed the blue velvet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if to demonstrate he understood that this bed was his . <p> " But at nighttime , you 'll sleep over here with me , Chester . " Annie scooped him up and put him on her own bed . Chester repeated his performance , carefully sniffing the blanket and pillows , finally settling himself in the most comfortable place to curl up for a nap - right between Annie 's two favorite stuffed toys , a pink teddy bear and a big blue bunny . " Daddy , look ! Chester likes my bed . " <p> " I 'm sure . It 's the nicest bed in the whole house . " I was beginning to have concerns that Annie was going to smother Chester with affection , that she saw him as a toy , a living teddy bear that she could cuddle forever . But if Chester was a normal terrier , he 'd set his own rules soon enough . <p> Very quickly , Chester revealed his own distinct personality . He did n't like to play tug of war , not even with a clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chase-the-squeaky . And sometimes **38;2344;TOOLONG . And most often , toss-the-squeaky at-your-feet . When he got tired of that game , he did laps from the kitchen to the dining room to the living room , down the hall to Annie 's bedroom , then back again to the living room , through the dining room , and skittering across the kitchen floor to a hairpin turn at the washing machine to do it all again . Annie laughed out loud , the first time since the accident . This had been a good decision . <p> Later , I tucked Annie and Chester into bed together . He snuggled in like a happy little lump . Annie petted him and whispered something in his ear , something about being a good guard dog against bad dreams . He licked her face , as if in happy agreement . <p> A half hour later , I peeked in on the two of them . Both were asleep , but Chester had quietly gotten down off Annie 's bed and gone to his own pillow in the corner . I scooped him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wake up , most puppies are that pliable - and put him down next to Annie again , a furry little comma . Still asleep , he stretched his legs out briefly , then relaxed again . <p> I puttered around for an hour , cleaning the kitchen , straightening up the living room , glancing into my office , wondering if I should try to get some work done , then finally , feeling like nothing in particular , I gave up . Just before heading off to my own bed , I checked in on Annie one more time . Chester was back on his velvet pillow . Once more , I scooped him up and put him down next to Annie . He trembled slightly , an odd reaction , then relaxed back into a deep sleep . <p> Annie woke me up , crying . " Daddy , there 's something wrong with Chester ! " <p> I glanced blearily at the clock - it was legally morning . Somewhere . I rolled out of bed with a sinking feeling and followed Annie back to her room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whimpering . When I put my hand on his side , he flinched and yelped - but he did n't lift his head . I scooped him up and held him gently in my arms - he screamed , a strange sound for such a small animal , breathless wails of panic . I slid my palm around his narrow chest , feeling for a heartbeat . It felt too fast for me , but small animals have very rapid heartbeats and I 'm no vet . I had no idea if this was normal . He shivered in my grasp-not the nervous shivering that small dogs are prone to , this was something else . <p> Annie watched us both , wide-eyed and too afraid to speak . I continued to hold the little pooch against my chest , lowered my face to the top of his head and began whispering . " It 's all right , guy . You 're a good boy . Everything 's all right . " He stopped crying , but he continued to tremble . <p> " Is he going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's just scared - " <p> Abruptly , I remembered something from a dozen years ago - another terrier , a short-haired sweetheart named Biscuit , as tan as a perfect pancake , when she put her ears up , she looked like Anubis . She loved people , she loved to play , and she was apparently fearless . I 'd take her with me on walks to the store and back . When we turned onto our block , I 'd take her off the leash so she could run free all the way home . She bounced with excitement . Except one time - she had n't gotten more than a few bounces ahead when two huge German shepherds dashed out from behind a hedge . One of them grabbed her firmly by the neck ; the German shepherds were young , barely a year old , just big overgrown pups , and they had come running out to play , except they were used to playing rough and Biscuit had n't seen them coming , she was caught by surprise . If an eagle had swept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't have been more frightened . She let out a wail of panic like nothing I 'd ever heard before . It turned into a series of long hurtful cries . The German shepherds backed away , startled , and I scooped up Biscuit so fast she did n't even realize it was me - she just kept on crying , trembling in panic . " All right , all right . It 's okay . " I looked her over carefully . Her fur was ruffled , but she had n't been bitten - just grabbed hard . I held her close and tried to comfort her ail the way home , but she would n't let me put her down . She was terrified . And when we did get home , she ran for her bed and stayed ; there until the following morning . <p> But that had been a tangible event - Biscuit had been grabbed by a much larger , momentarily ferocious animal that had leapt out of nowhere and ambushed her . This was .. .1 did n't know what it was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , even having bad dreams - two or three short whimpers , maybe some leg motion , and then the moment was past . But this - Chester was behaving as if he 'd been in a fight , grabbed and shaken and hurled against a wall . <p> I looked to Annie . The first question that came to mind was the one I did n't dare ask . Did you do something , Annie ? And if I did ask it , I would n't get an honest answer . " Did you see anything , Annie ? " <p> She shook her head . <p> " You did n't roll over on him by accident or bump him , did you ? " <p> " Nuh-uh . He just started crying all of a sudden . He woke me up . " And then she added , " Chester was having my dream . He was barking and growling at the underneath . But I was n't scared , because Chester was protecting me , just like you said he would . And then - it - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was - he was like that , and I came to get you . Is he going to be all right , Daddy ? " <p> Chester was calming down . He 'd stopped crying , stopped whimpering , and his trembling had ebbed to periodic spasms - short , intense bursts ; normal for a small excitable dog , but something had freaked this dog , that was certain . I started to put him back down on the bed , but as I lowered him , he went rigid and resistant ; instead , I carried him over to the corner and settled him down on his own pillow . He sat trembling , eyes wide , staring up at me . <p> " All right , let 's get dressed . We 'll take him to the doctor . He needs his shots anyway . " At first , I 'd wondered if perhaps Chester had been bitten by a spider or stung by a bee , - but if he had , he would have gone into shock by now . <p> Chester did n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to my bedroom and stayed close to me while I pulled on my pants and an old sweatshirt . Then he followed me to the kitchen and stayed close underfoot while I made a fresh pot of coffee . Annie fixed herself a bowl of Cheerios , but barely touched it . <p> The vet 's office did n't open until nine , but I knew the staff was there at seven to take care of the in-patients . I called ahead , and we pulled into the parking lot the same time as Dr. Brown . He took Chester from Annie 's arms and squinted as he held him aloft . " Looks like a dog , " he said . " Only smaller . Did you get him in a Happy Meal ? " <p> Michael Brown was an old friend ; we followed him inside . He put Chester on the table and listened to his heart , peeked into his ears , and even took a blood sample . He fingered Chester 's bobbed tail and said , " He 's probably had all his shots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll give him boosters . " <p> " But what about his bad dream - ? " Annie asked . <p> Michael Brown looked to me . I gave him the short version . Annie added , " Chester is my dream watchdog . " <p> " A dream watchdog , eh ? Any other symptoms ? " <p> I shook my head . " No . Just the crying and the trembling . " <p> " Any vomiting ? " <p> " I did n't see any . " <p> " Diarrhea ? " <p> " No . Nothing . " A thought occurred to me . " Could it have been a seizure ? " <p> " Not from what you describe . It sounds like he had a bad dream . " Dr. Brown peered into Chester 's face again , then rubbed his head affectionately . " You look fine to me . " <p> I was n't satisfied . " A bad dream ? That bad ? Can dogs have panic attacks ? " <p> Dr. Brown shrugged . " Du n no . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what he might have been through before you got him . He does n't look abused , but it 's possible he heard a sound that reactivated a very bad memory . It happens to people , it happens to animals . Have you ever seen a St. Bernard scared of lightning ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Not a lot of fun . " He handed Chester to me . " Take him home . Let him rest in a quiet dark corner . Keep an eye on him . Call me if anything changes , but he should be all right . " <p> Logically , I knew there had to be a rational explanation for all of this . But the sequence of illogical events argued for a more compelling and mysterious pattern - and whether there was logic or not was ultimately irrelevant , because Annie believed in the logic of her dreams . <p> And so did I. In the cold yellow light of the afternoon , all bad dreams seem silly . But I could still feel the troubled resonance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prowling through my files on phobias , panic attacks , unreasonable fears - and successful countertherapies as well . There was n't much here that I did n't already know . Most of it boiled down to " do n't invest any more energy into the fear ; that only makes it larger . " <p> That meant no more dreamcatchers , magic spells , or even dream watchdogs . We had to invest our energies into something positive and joyous . Except - that was the problem . I had a little girl without a mommy , with a scar and a limp ; a little girl who had lost her joy somewhere between Highway Twelve and the intensive care unit . There was no joy anymore , because Mommy never woke up . <p> What there was was the slow , steady , step-by-step , plodding through the process of " learning to live with it . " How did I explain to her that the pain never goes away , it just becomes another part of you ? You end up adding it to the mosaic of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little time as possible dwelling on . When you 're six years old , how do you learn to do that ? <p> By afternoon , Chester was ready to play again , as if nothing bad had happened last night . Annie spent the early hours of the evening tossing the squeaky toy for him . She even started calling him " doodle-bug " because of the way he doodled the toy around before finally giving it back . He punched the little red ball with his nose , tossing it toward her , obviously inviting her to pick it up and throw it for him . Annie laughed exuberantly , held the toy high , then hurled it down the hall . Chester bounced after it . <p> When bedtime finally rolled around , both Annie and her little doodle-bug trotted off obediently . Annie limped . Chester trotted , with the squeaky still in his mouth . <p> The little gray dog settled himself on his pillow , the red ball between his paws , and adamantly refused to get back up on Annie 's bed . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Annie , he promptly jumped right back down to the floor and went to his own place . Annie tried calling him and patting the bed next to her , but he just curled up and ignored her . Her crestfallen expression said it all . <p> " Maybe he 's still feeling bad from this morning . It 's all right , sweetheart . I 'll stay with you . " I tucked her in , then kicked off my shoes and lay down next to her . After a moment , I got up , scooped up Chester and put him between us . I put a hand on his back , not to hold him down , just to reassure him . He looked at me for a moment , then put his head between his paws . He looked sad . Or resigned . <p> Annie drifted off to sleep quickly . I thought about getting up and tiptoeing out , but the instant my breathing shifted , Chester 's head came up . His little button nose sniffed the air . His eyes were n't visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenseness in his posture . He growled - it was n't much , but then he was n't much of a dog , - just a little bit of meat and bone , and the rest was dust-bunny and attitude . His growl was so high-pitched , it was almost a cartoon - but he was serious . I remembered an old saying ; it 's not the size of the dog in the fight that counts , it 's the size of the fight in the dog . <p> " It 's all right , mini-pooch , " I said , patting his flank . " There 's nothing there . " His growl faded . After a bit , he put his head down again . Resting , not sleeping . Every so often , his head would come back up , as if he were staring at something on the other side of the wall ; he 'd watch the unseen threat for a bit , then lower his head again . Occasionally , he 'd mutter a soft meaningful " werf . " <p> I woke up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just a sudden awareness . Annie was sleeping soundly next to me . Chester lay between us , stretched out comfortably . Whatever threat he 'd imagined , either it was gone or he was too tired . I got up and headed to the bathroom . I checked all the doors and windows , made sure all the lights and all the appliances were turned off , then headed back to Annie 's room . Everything was all right there as well . So I padded off to my own bed . Maybe we were finally over the hump . Maybe . <p> Just before dawn - I was halfway down the hall before I realized I was awake , responding to an unearthly scream . Too high-pitched to be Annie 's voice - but it was . Or maybe it was her scream dissolving into the tail-end of whatever had screamed first . <p> The light from the hallway shone a bar of brightness into her room . Annie had leapt backward out of bed , trembling in her nightgown , backed against the wall . Her bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thrown it sideways , the sheets and blankets ripped and disheveled , and toys and books and clothes torn from her closets and drawers and shelves were everywhere . Annie pointed , still gasping <p> " Where 's Chester ? " I did n't wait for an answer . I pulled back the blankets . The little dog lay limp on her bed - at first I thought he was dead , but his heart was beating rapidly . His breath was shallow ; with my hand on his side , I could barely feel any motion . He looked shredded ; he was covered with dozens of tiny bites . I peeled back his upper lip ; his gums were pale . He was in shock . <p> Annie 's face was crumpled in terror ; she was half-crying , half-screaming . I grabbed her and held her . I did n't even try to ask what happened , I just scooped her up and held her . With one hand , I fumbled for the flashlight , then cursed and gave up . I flicked the light switch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights . There was nothing there . Nothing anywhere . I spotted the flashlight where I 'd left it the night before and grabbed it . I could use it as a club , if I had to . I looked under her bed , in the closet , checked the windows , then set Annie down , ran my hands up and down her sides , her arms , checked her head ; she seemed unhurt . <p> Turned back to Chester <p> " Is he going to be all right ? " <p> " I do n't know . Put on your clothes . We 'll take him to the doctor . " I checked again to see if he was still breathing . He was very still . I pulled on my pants and a sweatshirt , grabbed the car keys and my phone . I lifted Chester carefully , cradling him in one arm ; with the other hand , I punched for Dr. Brown . Annie was pulling on her bathrobe and limp-hobbling toward the door to the garage . <p> Michael Brown met us at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sorry for waking you - " <p> He ignored it . " Come on in the back . " <p> We followed him in . He switched on lights as he went . " Put him there - " A cold stainless steel table . He opened a cupboard and pulled things out . Syringes , tiny bottles , a surgical kit . " Annie , go stand over there . I want you out of the way . David , over here . " He switched on a bright overhead light . He peeled back Chester 's eyelids , peeled his upper lip and looked at his gums , even lifted up what was left of the little guy 's tail and examined his rectum - to see if the muscles were still tight . He plugged a stethoscope into his ears and listened to Chester 's heartbeat and breathing with a grim expression . At last , he grabbed syringe and a bottle of adrenalin . A quick injection directly into the heart . He listened again with the stethoscope , frowning . <p> Abruptly , he pasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switched on a monitor and the machine next to it and grabbed the defibrillator paddles - smaller versions than the ones on television . The monitor showed a very shallow , very uneven heartbeat . Dr. Brown applied the paddles ; there was a short sharp sound and Chester jerked . Then he lay still again . A second shock , still no change . <p> " Daddy- ? " <p> " Sometimes it takes a couple of tries , sweetheart . " <p> " Take her out of here , " Michael said . <p> I scooped her up and we went out into the waiting room . I sat down on the bench and held Annie in my lap . <p> " He 's going to die , is n't he ? " <p> " I do n't know , sweetheart . I do n't know . " <p> " He does n't deserve to die . He saved me . " <p> " Saved you ? " <p> " From ... it . " <p> I did n't know what to say , so I said nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Yes , he did , " I agreed . <p> " He 's a good dream watchdog . " <p> " Yes , he is . " <p> " He did n't let ... it ... get to me . " <p> " No , he did n't . " <p> We sat for a while in silence . Waiting . Annie leaned her head against my chest and was very still . I wondered if she 'd fallen back asleep , but I was n't going to shift my position to see . When Michael Brown came out of the back , she was instantly awake again . Michael looked grim . He shook his head without saying anything . <p> " What was it - ? " I started to ask , but his expression was guarded ; he was n't going to discuss the details in front of Annie . <p> " He 's dead , " she said . " Is n't he ? " <p> " I 'm sorry , sweetheart . " Dr. Brown went down on one knee so he could look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could . " <p> " I know , " she answered calmly . Then she looked up at me . " Daddy ? " she said . " We 're going to need a bigger dog . " <p> IMG
