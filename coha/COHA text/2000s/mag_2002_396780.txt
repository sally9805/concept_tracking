// You 'll beg to take out the garbage when you can feed it to your bin of red wiggler worms ! These small , quiet creatures spend their days munching away on your kitchen scraps , making good , rich fertilizer for your garden . Now , how could your parents refuse to get you some ( or maybe 1,000 ! ) of these helpful , well-behaved pets ? What you need : Drill ( for use with grown-up help ) Wooden or plastic bin ( no more than 1 1/2 ' or 45 cm deep with a lid 1 " ( 2.5 cm ) strips of old newspaper Large sheet of plastic or several layers of old newspaper Small amount of soil Water Red wiggler worms Wooden blocks What you do : To prepare the worms ' bed 1 . With a grown-up 's help , drill 10 to 12 holes in the bottom of the bin for drainage and airflow . ( Do n't worry ; the worms wo n't escape ! ) 2 . Fill the bin about three-fourths full of newspaper strips ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worm 's gizzard so it can digest its food ) . Mix everything together and moisten it , letting the water soak in . The bedding has to be damp ( a worm needs to keep its skin moist so it can breathe through it ) but not too wet . Squeeze a handful of bedding-if you get more than a few drops of water , pour off the excess or let the box dry out a bit . 3 . Place the worms in the box and watch them immediately start to burrow down where it 's dark and damp ! Then , put the lid on . 4 . Place the box on wooden blocks ( for air circulation ) with plastic or newspapers underneath it where the air temperature will be between 55 deg and 77 deg F ( 13 deg to 25 deg C ) . To feed the worms A pound ( 500 g ) of red wigglers ( about 1,000 worms ) will eat about three pounds ( 1.5 kg ) of food a week . You can feed them fruit and vegetable scraps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for calcium ) - even those " science projects " from the back of the fridge are OK . Just avoid meat , dairy products , and oily foods . Add small amounts of food each day , placing them in different sections of the bin . To remove the castings Your worms are like tiny composting bins : The food scraps and bedding go in one end , and dark , crumbly castings ( everything the worm does n't digest ) come out the other end . Using worms to make compost is called vermicomposting . The castings are actually poisonous to the worms , so it 's important to remove them about once a month . Plus , it 's fun ! Really ! // // Spread out the contents of the bin on the plastic sheet . Remove the top layer of bedding and let the worms move down to escape the light . Separate out the dark , crumbly castings . Keep removing the top layer and then waiting a minute or so , until you are left with a pile of worms . See if you spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to 20 eggs ( although usually only three or four worms hatch ) . The cocoons turn red when the worms are ready to wiggle out . Put the worms , a few cocoons , and the bedding back in the bin , and you 're ready to roll Add fresh bedding and a little more soil about every four months . Give your garden plants or your houseplants a real treat by sprinkling some nutrient-packed castings on the soil around them . Now you 're a great vermicomposter-or make that wormi-composter ! - reprinted from Garden Fun ! by Vicky Congdon Garden Fun ! by Vicky Congdon is filled with other fun gardening activities from growing your own popcorn to building birdhouses with gourds . Whether you are a beginner or a master gardener , there is something here for you ! Sidebar Most of the worms you 'd find in the yard or garden prefer cooler temperatures than you could easily provide in your worm box , What 's more , these are likely to be earthmovers , which prefer to eat soil . Sidebar For a worm box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a big group eating plants and turning them into castings . Red wigglers ( also called redworms or manure worms ) are a composting worm that will live very happily in a worm box . They are easy to raise and can survive in a wide range of temperatures .
