George Bush has a problem . The President of the U.S. is utterly convinced that Saddam Hussein is an evil so dangerous and immediate that only war can expunge the threat  --  barring some miraculous 11th-hour departure or resolution . For months Bush has done his darnedest to make this case and convince the world that the application of American might is the best way to eradicate the menace . But he has n't persuaded everyone just yet . <P> That 's why lights burned into the night at CIA headquarters last week as a special team of planners shuttled from the State Department and the White House to join agency analysts in poring over piles of satellite photos and phone intercepts , sifting through tapes from defectors and interrogations of detainees . Bush had just pledged in his State of the Union speech that Secretary of State Colin Powell would take fresh , compelling evidence to the U.N . in seven days ' time to bolster the case for war . These officials were struggling to choose exactly what to include . The selection had to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all without compromising sources or revealing intelligence that G.I.s might need when the shooting starts . Powell wanted not a speech but a replica of the sharp military-style briefings that helped earn him his Gulf War fame . " He taught at infantry school with slides and presentations , " says a senior State official . " He knows how to do this . " <P> He had better . As officials wrestled over what particulars to use , Powell 's appearance before the U.N . seemed to be setting up a diplomatic high noon . At stake was not so much whether war would ensue but whether the U.S. would fight it with all the legal , moral , political and popular support U.N . benediction would confer . Bush has said all along that the U.S. would go it alone if need be . It 's no secret that some in his Administration were eager to do just that way back last summer . But Powell convinced Bush then of the benefits of operating with U.N . approval . <P> Now the day is fast approaching when Bush expects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put up or shut up . To win them over , Powell needs to deliver an argument for attacking Iraq that is solid enough to override the reluctance gripping key capitals . And if he gets their backing , Bush is also likely to win something he needs almost as much : greater support at home . Polls show Americans would go to war , but they would feel a lot better about it with the U.N . behind them . <P> So what 's the magic up Powell 's sleeve ? Sources tell TIME he 'll attack on three fronts , presenting evidence of elusive weapons of mass destruction , persistent obstructions of inspections and links to terrorism . The drama is likely to come as much in the delivery  --  high-tech photos , raw audiotapes  --  as in the substance . The danger is that even the best intelligence is almost always subject to widely differing interpretations . Maybe they were cleverly lowering expectations , but in the days before Powell 's performance , Administration officials were fairly uniform in admitting the presentation would contain only a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstantial and deductive , the kind of evidence that does n't quite yield the " Aha ! " moment that greeted Adlai Stevenson 's display of the famous Cuban-missile photos at the U.N . in 1962.
