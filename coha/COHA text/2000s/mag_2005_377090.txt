Unlike the Washington bigwigs he has made a career of talking about , Armstrong Williams fesses up when caught red- handed . " My judgment was not the best , " the conservative pundit admitted after USA Today uncovered a Department of Education contract paying him $240,000 to promote President Bush 's No Child Left Behind law on his talk show , The Right Side , and in other TV appearances . The contract required him to " regularly comment on NCLB during the course of his broadcasts " and to encourage other journalists to talk up the law . <P> Williams is paying for his journalistic sins . His weekly syndicated newspaper column was terminated last Friday . But the Bush Administration appears unfazed . Education Department officials called the contract " a permissible use of taxpayer funds . " This despite two recent Government Accountability Office rulings that the Administration broke antipropaganda laws when it disguised promotional spots  --  on federal drug policy and the new Medicare prescription-drug law  --  as TV-news segments .  --  By Perry Bacon Jr        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
