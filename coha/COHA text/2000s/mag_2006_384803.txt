Schools Waste $1.5 Billion in Energy Costs Every Year // Have you ever driven by a school in your community at night and seen the lights blazing , when you know the building is empty ? Do you wonder how much money and energy that wastes ? The United States Department of Energy has an answer for you , sort of . If your school district is typical , one of every four dollars it spends on energy is unnecessary . Photograph Dave Gupta ( third from right ) of Broad Run High School in Loudoun County , Virginia won an award for his energy-saving light switch cover . // That 's more money than the district likely spends on textbooks and computers each year . While 15 percent of this waste comes from outdated equipment , one of every 10 energy dollars could be saved simply by turning off unneeded lights , shutting down computers and leaving personal space heaters at home , experts say . " I 've talked with superintendents who have already spent their energy budgets with three months left in the fiscal year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy services . " The 25 percent figure is conservative , it 's probably higher than that in many , many schools , " says Merrilee Harrigan , the director of education at the Alliance to Save Energy . " Schools have a lot of old stuff . We do n't often fund our schools very well , so that is a problem . " Edgar Hatrick , superintendent of Loudoun County Public Schools in Leesburg , Virginia , says , " Money is still a wonderful motivator . " In 12 years of the district 's energy-saving program , Hatrick says Loudoun County has been able to avoid $ 17 million in energy costs in its 68 schools . " That 's bought some textbooks and teachers , " he adds . Hatrick 's energy program , with help from an outside company , Energy Education in Wichita Falls , Texas , pays attention to items both big and small . The district completes regular energy audits , replaces old boilers before they become inefficient hogs , switches out single-pane windows , and even goes so far as to disconnect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electricity costs . " We mind the pennies , nickels and dimes , " Hatrick says . Nationwide , that spare change can add up . There are 133,000 K-12 publicschools . Together , energy costs for these buildings total $6 billion , so $1.5 billion could be saved . There are some gross examples of misuse . In one elementary school in Oregon , a malfunctioning heating and ventilation system ran around the clock and on weekends . In the Charleston County South Carolina School District , the heating , ventilation and airconditioning ( HVAC ) system ran during the summer in many unused buildings to combat mold growth . The district has since devised a system that keeps humidity in check without unnecessarily cooling the empty buildings . Chances are this type of waste is n't news to the people who run your towns schools . A 1995 nationwide survey of infrastructure needs shows nearly half of school officials reported at least one unsatisfactory environmental issue in their buildings , from heating to lighting to ventilation to air quality . More than 40 percent gave their schools an unsatisfactory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed ? It all comes back to money . The same survey estimates that it would cost $112 billion to repair , renovate and modernize the country 's schools . But more and more school districts are finding ways to make these changes without big payments up front by signing performance contracts with companies such as Honeywell , Johnson Controls and Energy Education . These contracts allow big-money changes to be made right away , with the company bearing the cost . In return , the companies get to keep a percentage of the guaranteed energy savings over the life of the deal , usually 10 to 15 years . " Our primary purpose is to educate children , " says Forest Yocum , superintendent of the Southwest Licking School District near Columbus , Ohio . " Building upkeep has to take second fiddle . The community will want me to purchase textbooks instead of boilers . " Southwest Licking has 3,000 students and five buildings . Like many school districts , it was facing three problems at once : aging facilities , shrinking budgets and a growing student population . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to make $1.6 million in infrastructure improvements without spending any additional tax money . The district expects to save $175,000 in annual energy costs for the next 15 years . The story is the same in the Twin Falls Idaho School District . A performance contract allowed the district to spend $4.8 million replacing lights , fixing roofs , updating HVAC systems and installing a building management system that can automate energy and heat usage throughout the district 's 11 buildings . Schools that post energy savings are guaranteed to get some of that money back in their operating budget , says Superintendent Wiley Dobbs . The work , which took months to complete , " would have normally taken us a decade because of budget constraints , " says John Miller , the district 's director of operations . Better yet , after the savings and publicity this program started , three neighboring districts have begun their own energy-saving programs , Dobbs says . Some districts are even going beyond conventional upgrades . Twin Falls updated the geothermal system at one of its schools and Southwest Licking was able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The solar panel has been integrated into the school 's science curriculum and has allowed Yokum to sell a small amount of energy back to the power company . Besides bringing math and science education to life , schools are using the army of students to do some of their work . Students in Philadelphia mapped classroom temperatures and presented the data to the building engineer to fix their schools ' uneven heating system . Like many districts , Loudoun County tries to get students involved in conservation . It has a contest to design light switch covers to encourage turning unneeded lights off . " I 'm convinced children can make a difference , " Hatrick says . " I started wearing my seatbelt because my kids told me ; I stopped smoking because my kids told me . I 'm convinced that children in school will affect behaviors at home . " Homeowners complaining about waste in the schools should realize , however , that the government estimates the typical household could also save $450 on its $1,500 annual energy bill . That 's a potential savings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
