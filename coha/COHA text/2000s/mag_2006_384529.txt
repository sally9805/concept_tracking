. From sport hunting to self-defense , this year 's class of new handguns offers great innovation and value . If you had to summarize this year 's selection of new handguns in a single word , it would be " diverse . " For long-range fans , Weatherby 's new target-grade bolt-action is worth a look . Small-game hunters and rimfire target shooters need to check out the new Browning Buck Mark models , while single-action aficionados will welcome a new game-busting .50-caliber load as well as the return of an old favorite . And self-defense and sport shooters will find several new guns to suit their interests . Here 's a look at the top offerings this year . BROWNING ARMS Those who favor rimfire handguns , whether for hunting , competition or plain old plinking , will want to check out Browning 's three new models in the company 's popular Buck Mark semi-auto rimfire line . The Buck Mark Lite Splash 5.5 and 7.25 URX models feature Browning 's new soft nitrile Ultragrip RX ambidextrous grip design . The alloy receiver and alloy-sleev ed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Browning 's Pro- Target adjustable rear sight and Truglo/Marble 's fiber-optic front sight are standard . Available in 5.5- and 7.25-inch barrels . ( $454  --  $483 ) The Buck Mark Contour ( also available in 5.5- and 7.25-inch barrels ) uses the same grip material and design . Its special-contour barrel , finished in matte blue , has a full-length scope base and integrated Pro-Target adjustable sight and front blade . The combination of integral iron sights and scope base is , in my opinion , one of the more useful configurations on a field pistol because it offers an array of sight options . When you 're targeting squirrels or varmints , slip on a low-power variable scope . Run ning cottontails are best handled with an electronic red-dot sight mounted . Once the optics are ringed up , installed on the gun and sighted-in , they can be removed and reinstalled with minimal ( if any ) change in the original point of impact , so you can use the iron sights when you prefer . It 's an extremely versatile sight system . ( $413  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7.25-inch heavy round fluted bull barrel . The alloy receiver is finished in matte blue . The grips are really flashy and made of laminated rosewood . Pro-Target adjustable sights are standard . ( $643 ; browning.com ) FREEDOM ARMS The Freedom Arms Model 83 has a well-deserved reputation among experienced handgun hunters as one of the premier single-action revolvers on the market . This year it will be offered in a new proprietary cartridge that is suitable for virtually any big-game animal you might hunt with a handgun . The .500 Wyoming Express ( .500WE ) is a straight-walled cartridge using a belted case and large rifle primers . Designed for bullets weighing 350 to 440 grains , it can launch a 350-grain Hornady XTP jacketed hollowpoint at 1,600 fps from a 7.5-inch barrel . The same velocity range is achievable with 370- and 400-grain cast-lead bullets , and the 440-grain cast-lead slugs can reach 1,400 fps . That 's not very far from the S &W; .500 Magnum , yet the cartridge is compact enough to fit into the existing Model 83 SA . So far , the cartridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dies and load data are available from Freedom Arms . The .500 WE is chambered in both the five-shot Premier Grade , with laminated hardwood grips and click-adjustable sights ( $2,120 ) , and the five-shot Field Grade , using Pachmayr grips and a rear sight that 's click-adjustable for elevation and drift-adjustable for windage ( $1,639 ) . Barrel lengths of 4.75 , 6 and 7.75 inches are available . ( freedomarms.com ) STURM , RUGER &; CO . When the Ruger .44 Magnum " flattop " was introduced in 1956 , handgunning authority Elmer Keith proclaimed it the finest single-action revolver yet made . Newer and stronger single-action designs have followed , but shooters mourned the gun 's passage when it was discontinued in 1962 . Many feel it was the most elegant single-action revolver Ruger ever produced . This year the gun will return as a special anniversary model . The Ruger 50th Anniversary .44 Magnum New Model Blackhawk features the trim flattop-style cylinder frame with the original micro-style click-adjustable rear sight and fluted cylinder that were the hallmark of the original . It also incorporates the smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and checkered black grip panels with the original Ruger grip medallions . The guns are adorned with a gold-colored barrel roll mark noting " 50 Years of .44 Magnum  --  1956  --  2006 . " Externally , it recaptures the elegant lines of the original flattop . Internally , the 50th-anniversary model boasts the latest mechanical features found on current Ruger single-action revolvers . These include the transfer-bar ignition system and loading-gate mechanism , the patented reverse-indexing pawl , and an unobtrusive internal lock under the right grip panel . Although some may view this as a collector 's item , the mechanical im provements make it a solid " working gun " that can perform as nicely in the field as it looks in the gun case . ( $605 ; ruger.com ) WEATHERBY Handgun hunters who appreciate the range and accuracy of a bolt-action pistol will like the new Weatherby Compact Firing Platform ( CFP ) . The CFP is a target-grade bolt gun using Weatherby 's Mark Vaction mated to a 16-inch 4140 chrome-moly steel , target-crowned No. 2 contour barrel . The ac tion is pillar-bedded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grip design and features distinctive black spiderwebbing . All metalwork is bead blasted to a matte blue finish to reduce game-spooking glare , and the gun is drilled and tapped for scope mounting . With an overall length of 27.5 inches and an empty weight of 5.25 pounds , it 's a handful of handgun , and with a price tag of $1,499 , it 's not inexpensive . But like all Weatherby Mark V firearms , it 's guaranteed to produce three-shot 1.5-inch groups at 100 yards ( from a cold barrel ) when using premium ammunition . The CFP will be available in .223 Rem . and .22-250 Rem . for varmint hunters , in 7mm-08 for those pursuing medium game and in .243 Win . for those who wish to target both . ( weatherby.com ) BOX Defense Guns CZ-USA The CZ 75 P-01 is popular among shooters looking for a midsize 9mm self-defense pistol . This year CZ brings out two full-size versions with the SP-01 and SP-01 Tactical models . The SP-01 series is built on the same alloy frame as the P-01 , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ models feature the CZ DA/SA trigger design and incorporate the improved grip geometry of the P-01 , with rubber grip panels , front and rear strap serrations , extended beavertail , front slide cocking serrations and an integral accessory rail on the dust cover for mounting lights and lasers . The SP-01 features ambidextrous manual safeties to allow a cocked-and-locked carry , while the Tactical model has ambidextrous decocker levers for a hammer-down DA carry . Fixed sights are standard and magazine capacity is 19 rounds , but the gun will also accept all 10- , 15- and 16-round 9mm CZ-75B magazines . Although the SP-01 series is designed for self-defense , its features are already making it popular with some action-pistol competitors . ( $595  --  $615 ; cz-usa.com ) SMITH &; WESSON Those who wander wild places know the advantage of having some big bullets on hand , and if they want them in a compact package , the new S &W; Performance Center .45 Long Colt Mountain Gun is a good bet . Like the .44 Magnum Mountain Gun , the .45 LC uses the large , six-shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a fluted cylinder and a tapered 4-inch barrel . Sights are a pinned black front ramp and the S &W; adjustable rear sight . Hogue rubber Monogrips are standard , and the gun is drilled and tapped for optical sights . Although this same package is available in .44 Magnum , the .45 LC version has its advantages . Recoil is less , and a .45-caliber slug in the 250- to 260-grain weight at a velocity of 850 to 900 fps is nothing to sneeze at . ( $815 ; smith-wesson.com ) PARA-ORDNANCE Built on Para 's high-capacity 1911 frame , the new Todd Jarrett/USPSA Limited Edition .40 S &W; is sure to be popular with action-pistol competitors . This 16-shot , full-size , single- action pistol features a match-grade trigger , high-impact polymer grips , a carbon-steel frame finished in covert black and a stainless-steel slide with a brushed sterling finish . It 's topped with a fiber-optic front sight and a Novak Extreme Duty adjustable rear . While competition is the intended purpose , 16 rounds of .40 S &W; on tap makes it a potent self-defense tool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; paraord.com ) According to surveys conducted by the National Shooting Sports Foundation , target shooting with a handgun is one of the five fastest-growing outdoor sports . Many of those shooters are . T should prove popular with them . Author Affiliation <p>                     @x A white-hinged sign with a big red crab painted on it loomed out of the thinning fog . <p> " Jesus . " Mother swerved to the right . <p> Her sister , Louise , replied sharply , " Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord in vain . " <p> " I did n't , you twit , I took his son 's . " <p> " The Holy Trinity , Father , Son , and Holy Ghost . Same . " <p> " This is supposed to be a trip to the Bay . If I want religious instruction I 'll go to church . " <p> " Well , that 's just it , is n't it ? " Louise was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God 's punishment . Otherwise you 'd worship at the One True Church . " <p> Mother , sidestepping the bait for a fight dangled by her older sister-just how much older also a ripe subject for contention-shrugged . " God will forgive me , that 's His trade . " <p> Louise , pretty in what she deemed her midforties , crossed her arms over her chest . She was closer to fifty-two or fifty-three . <p> Awakened by the swerve , I piped up , " How long till we get there ? " <p> " Not long . " Mother avoided being specific . <p> " Forty-five minutes . If this fog would lift we 'd get there faster . " Louise feared driving in fog , which was sensible . <p> Mother feared nothing . At least that 's what I thought at seven . Although Mother drove , we rumbled along in Aunt Wheezie 's new black Nash with the dull gray interior . I hated the car but kept that opinion to myself . Why would anyone want to drive a car that looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which delighted my father and amused my mother . Leroy , still asleep next to me , evidenced no interest in motors even though he was a boy . He 'd turned eight in June . I would n't reach that advanced age until November , so those extra months pleased him even if cars did not . <p> " I love the Chesapeake Bay . " Mother smiled as the first sliver of pink appeared on the horizon , the fog thinning in places . " Wheeze , remember when Aunt Doney and Uncle Jim took us down here for the Fourth of July ? I must have been Nickel 's age . " <p> Louise smiled broadly , " Aunt Doney wore so much linen and gauze she looked like an Arab . " <p> " She was so fair , " Mother remarked . <p> " I 'll never forget when you and I got tan and she had a hissy . Said we looked like field hands . " <p> " Better field hands than cadavers . " Mother felt like someone had told her what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her life and Aunt Doney was no exception . <p> " She had a point , I guess , but we were in our teens then and Coco Chanel started the fad for white clothes in summer , and a tan . Oh , remember that French boater striped top I wore ? Blue and white . I just thought that was the most beautiful thing . " <p> " It was . " <p> " And that 's why I never let you borrow it . You 'd have torn it or spilled something on it . Juts , you 're so rough sometimes . Just watching you dance is exhausting . " <p> " Mother , when were you and Aunt Wheezie here with Aunt Doney and Uncle Jim ? " <p> " I think the first time was 1912 . Took forever to get here . There used to be a spur line so you could take the train to St. Mary 's . We stayed a whole week . " <p> Aunt Louise , to remind me of what I already knew-because I really liked history-said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You took a trolley , a train , or a horse-drawn buggy . Did n't Mrs. Chalfonte get the first car in Runnymede ? " <p> " No , her brother did . The brother was killed in the war , " Mother replied . <p> " Same war as PopPop ? " I asked . <p> " Same war , " Aunt Louise affirmed . " I pray to God there will never be another one . It was the war to end all wars . " <p> " We know better . " Mother slowed for an S curve . A truck with wooden panels on the sides to hold in its load of hay was lurching toward us from the opposite direction . <p> " World War Two is still World War One . " Aunt Louise stared out the window , the lifting fog now bright pink . <p> " Why ? " <p> " Did n't settle the issues the first time . " Aunt Louise , not a keen student of history , paid attention to current affairs and for her these had been current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People like to kill each other , " Mother stated flatly . <p> " If the peoples of the world accept Christ , war would end forever . " <p> " Aunt Wheezie , how can they accept Christ if they have their own God ? " <p> " They 're wrong . " This was said with finality and conviction . <p> " Oh . " I did n't press it mostly because religion fascinated me much less than horses , cars , and history . <p> " Let 's go back to that place for lunch , " Mother suggested . <p> " It 's forty-five minutes from St. Mary 's . " Aunt Louise named the county at the southern tip of southern Maryland . The little town there was called St. Mary 's City . <p> " You 're right . Okay , Nick , you keep your eyes peeled for another sign like that and we 'll stop for lunch on the way home . We ca n't stay here all day , which is why we started so early . Anyway , I love to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds are flying around and talking to one another . And you know it 's August and the coots will be flying in for a rest . " <p> Coots were a type of duck that migrated . In wintertime other types of ducks stayed on the Bay , over a million of them . <p> " Juts , birds do n't talk to one another . " Louise shook her head at her fanciful younger sister . <p> " They do . We do n't understand it , that 's all . " She breathed in , quickly changing the subject because Louise could be contrary and she was edging on it today . " Think Aunt Doney could make the trip ? " <p> " To St. Mary 's County ? " <p> " Well , yes . We could fix up the back seat and she could sleep . There are folding wheelchairs . " <p> " No matter . They wo n't push in the sand . " <p> Mother sighed . " You 're right . " <p> These words , more than any other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Doney ? " I asked . <p> " Ninety-eight , " Louise replied . <p> " Oh . " I could n't fathom this but I did know that the maternal side of our family routinely lived a long time . We had Bibles going back to 1620 and written in various beautiful hands were the birthdays and death days of our forebearers . A lot of the men died in wars but those women who survived childhood seemed semi-immortal . As it was , Aunt Doney 's brother was still alive and he 'd fought in the War Between the States , being not much older than myself at the time . He was in a wheelchair , too . It made me wonder if you could live too long . <p> Mother checked the rearview mirror . " That boy can sleep through a thunderstorm . " <p> " He sleeps a lot since Ginny died . " Louise 's voice lowered . <p> Ginny , her daughter , had died in February 1952 , six months back , at age thirty-three . Leroy cried a lot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Sixth Division , who had been a war hero at Okinawa . That shocked me , and scared me , too . <p> " Children are made of rubber . He 'll bounce back . " Mother kept a positive outlook . <p> " I do n't know , Juts . I hope so . It takes a lot of living to understand death . He 's eight . Imagine if we 'd lost Momma at eight . " <p> " We would have had each other . " Mother stopped herself from making light of it . " But I expect we would have cried ourselves to sleep for a long , long time . " <p> " And the poor little guy has to live up to Ken . How can he do that ? How do you live up to a father who won the Distinguished Service Medal for conspicuous bravery ? " <p> " Sis , Leroy is n't the first one of our family to have a hero father . One of us has been in every war or uprising since the Jamestown Massacre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Jamestown Massacre occurred in 1622 , on Good Friday , along the James River in Virginia . <p> " That 's Chessy 's family not ours . Never forget , Julia , " she used Mother 's full name , " We 're Marylanders . " <p> " Still . There 's always been someone in a war somewhere . There will always be war . " She cut off Louise 's protest . " You know yourself that Americans do n't all follow the word so why would you think someone in the Ukraine will ? It 's just the way it is . " <p> " Makes me sick . " Louise meant it . <p> " I guess it would make me sick if I had to see it and smell it . " Mother glanced to the left , the east . We were nearing the point of St. Mary 's County and the sun was breaking over where the Chesapeake Bay meets the Potomac River at Point Lookout . Virginia reposed to the west and the other chunk of Maryland to the east . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bay like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle . <p> " You tickle me . " Louise smiled . <p> " Why ? " <p> " You 'd clap your hands when the sun came up when you were little . Momma would laugh and you 'd clap more . " She sighed . <p> " What 's better than a new day ? " Mother beamed . <p> Their mother , Cora , died in 1947 . I was almost three . I remembered everyone crying . That was my first brush with someone leaving Earth . Next came one of my cousins when he was five , and then Ginny . It worried me . If they were going to a better place then why was everyone crying ? <p> Louise rolled down the window and the still-cool air rushed in , " I know the sun 's coming up in the east but I do n't know what 's coming with it . " <p> " Good times . " Mother beamed . <p> " I do n't know . " <p> " Sis , good times . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Aunt Louise nursed her . Mother bore the full brunt of her sister 's grief and she grieved , too , for Ginny was an exceptionally lovable person . <p> A long silence followed , then Louise drew in her breath , finally exhaling in one long stream . " I 'm starting to feel old . " <p> " Do n't be silly . You 're not a day over fifty-two . " <p> " Forty-six , " came the swift , icy reply . <p> " Ha . " <p> " You 'll always be my baby sister but do n't make me older than I am . " She shifted in her seat , rolling up the window because the air was brisk even though it was August . " Middle age is tricky . Some days I feel like I 'm sixteen and other days , well .... " Her voice trailed off . <p> " I would n't know , " came the saucy reply . <p> " Ha right back at you . " Louise smiled broadly . <p> " You 're only as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I try , Baby Sis , but sometimes things wash over me . " <p> A silence followed . " Guess it does . " Another moment passed and Mother added , " We have to fight back . In a way we have to live harder for Ginny . If you tart yourself up you 'll feel better and younger . Really . " <p> " Maybe , but I do n't care if I bury my face in Pond 's cold cream , the wrinkles are arriving . " <p> " You look great . " <p> Mother was n't lying . Beautiful skin that aged slowly was a family trait . If anything , the men 's skin glowed even fresher than the women 's . Mother said shaving kept their skin smooth . <p> " You two look like twins . " I added my two cents . <p> Mother , while grateful that I was mollifying her sister , shot me a fleeting glance . She liked being the baby and did n't want to look like Louise 's twin . <p> " Are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised up enough so we could see the landscape , flat as a pancake . The point of St. Mary 's County lay right in front of us , what passed for a parking lot was crushed seashells . Beyond that the sands shifted with the winds , which fortunately were light . <p> Mother pulled onto the shells , tires crunching them , as the sun cleared the horizon . " Rise and shine . " <p> I shook Leroy . " Wake up . " <p> He opened his eyes , then sat up . " Look at all those birds . Aunt Wheezie , I have to go to the bathroom . " <p> As Mother cut the motor , Louise opened the heavy car door , then opened the back door , and Leroy stepped out , his PF Flyers bright white because he 'd scrubbed them with an S.O.S. pad . Leroy kept things organized and clean since his daddy insisted his son do chores in proper military fashion . I had to be organized , too . <p> " Honey , there 's no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed to the edge of the shells . " Do n't forget to shake . " <p> Beet red , he mumbled , " Yes , Ma'am . " <p> " I 'm gon na look , " I taunted . <p> Mother put her hand on my shoulder . " Nickel , do n't be ugly . " <p> " Mother , I 've seen earthworms bigger than that . " <p> " When did you see Leroy 's part ? " Aunt Louise 's eyebrows shot up almost to her widow 's peak . <p> " All the time . He always has to go to the bathroom . " I shrugged because it did n't seem like a big deal to me . <p> Mother considered this , then patiently counseled , " Do n't make fun of him . Boys , uh , " she thought some more , " boys are very nervous about their part even if they brag about it . " <p> Louise concurred . " They 're very sensitive . I certainly hope he has n't examined you . " She enunciated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't care about me at all . I do n't want to see him but like I said , he 's always going to the bathroom . I do n't know why . I do n't have to go to the bathroom that often . " <p> They ignored my prattle as Mother opened the trunk of the car . <p> " I 'll carry the hamper if you carry the big cooler . " Louise reached for the cooler , the same one Dad used when he went pheasant hunting . <p> Mother without complaint lifted out the drinks cooler with a grunt . She knew Louise 's back often hurt . <p> " Mother , Leroy says his part hurts sometimes . Why is that ? " <p> " Fills with blood . " <p> This sounded awful . " Should he go to the doctor ? " <p> Both sisters laughed , then Louise said , " No . " <p> " I do n't see blood . " <p> " Nickel , this is a discussion for another day , " Mother suggested , which meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though I did say , " Well , I 'm glad I do n't have that problem . " <p> " I am , too . " Mother walked across the sand , her arms extended because the cooler was heavily loaded with drinks . <p> Louise followed with the hamper . " You wait for Leroy and then bring the blankets and my bag of tools . We 're going to pick the perfect spot . " <p> I leaned against the side of the car , the side away from Leroy , and when he whistled and returned , I lifted out a blanket and handed it to him . I took another blanket and picked up the plumber 's bag , then closed the trunk . Inside the canvas plumber 's bag were trowels , small buckets , a tin measuring cup , a T-square , popsicle sticks , pieces of colored paper , twine , scissors , a whittling knife , and a bottle of nail polish . He followed me toward where Mother and Aunt Louise stood , right hands shading their eyes . <p> Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , Louise pointed to the water , " Look at that . " <p> A school of small fish were jumping out of the water , the sun turning their silver bodies red . <p> " Wow , " Leroy held the blanket to his chest . <p> " Got ta be a shark or something pushing them . " Mother studied nature and could identify birds and birdsongs , animals , trees , wildflowers . She taught me these things , including the different cries for mating , defending territory , and the " just plain happy " cry as she called it . <p> Leroy hugged the blanket tighter , " I 'm not going in the water . " <p> " Not now anyway . Sunrise is breakfast time for everyone and your little toes would look so tasty . " Mother teased him . <p> " I 'll keep my sneakers on , " he replied solemnly . <p> Louise laughed , bending down to kiss his cheek . " Do n't do that . By the time the water warms up you 'll be safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . <p> " Who 's hungry ? " Mother took Leroy 's blanket and spread it out . <p> Louise spread out my blanket and within minutes ham biscuits , cheese , little apple tarts , and deviled eggs graced the center of the blankets . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
