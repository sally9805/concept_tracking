Jones , already a symbol of sexual exploitation of children in Atlanta , has become an unwitting figure in Mayor Bill Campbell 's ongoing battle with federal authorities . <p> On Tuesday , community activists , including a key aide to Campbell , made public the girl 's accusation that an employee of the U.S. Attorney 's Office had sex with her . Hours later , the mayor issued a statement that the allegation was part of the reason he did n't want federal officials involved in searching for Shamila before she was found in Las Vegas last week . <p> The teenager ran away again Saturday night after being returned home from Nevada , but was found at the West End MARTA station about 6 p.m . Tuesday . Atlanta police spokesman John Quigley said authorities were not sure where they would take her . <p> Richard Sheats , the community resource specialist in the U.S. Attorney 's Office who was accused by Shamila , resigned effective Monday . He said he was quitting because his integrity had been called into question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Campbell last week dispatched aide Michael Langford to Las Vegas to help return Shamila to Atlanta . He pointedly declined to ask for help from the U.S. Attorney 's office , which is investigating allegations of City Hall corruption . <p> In his statement Tuesday , Campbell elaborated on his reason for shunning the U.S. attorney 's office , citing federal prosecutors ' dealings with Michael Childs , a strip club owner who has accused the mayor of corruption . <p> " Based on the involvement with Michael Childs , owner of Club Nikki , where the girl worked as a dancer , I did not think they ( the U.S. Attorney 's office ) were appropriate partners , " Campbell said . " Additionally , this young girl made allegations about a person who worked in the U.S. Attorney 's office . " <p> The mayor pulled Club Nikki 's liquor license last month , citing numerous violations . <p> Childs has said the mayor targeted his club because Childs is aiding the investigation into allegations of City Hall corruption .

While acknowledging they do n't know whether the girl 's story is true , they called on U.S. Attorney Richard Deane to conduct a thorough investigation . <p> Citing an ongoing investigation by the Justice Department 's inspector general , Deane said he could n't comment . <p> Sheats , who has had a key role in an ongoing federal investigation of pimps and underage prostitutes , said in a letter released by Deane 's office that he resigned " to avoid any further damage to the program and office which I have worked with for nearly two years . " <p> Shamila 's mother , Clairee Jones , said the girl told her that Sheats gave her alcohol and forced her to have sex at his home in Walton County in January .

" It was n't a good decision , " she said . " He put himself at risk as well as her . " <p> The girl 's mother had called Sheats because he had been helping the family try to find the child . After police brought Shamila home , Jones and Sheats decided that because the girl was prone to running away , the only available option over the weekend was to place her in custody until the court could decide Monday what to do with her . <p> Hickson said she later found out the youth jail had refused to take the child . Federal law prohibits detaining in youth jails children who have committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish there had been some contact with me over the weekend to see if we could have held her , " Hickson said . " But he got the runaround . " <p> The girl 's mother gave Sheats permission to take Shamila to his home in Monroe until the court reopened Monday . But that weekend , Shamila allegedly stole Sheats ' car , and by Monday was gone again . <p> Hickson said Sheats called him that day and told him what had transpired over the weekend . She said she did not learn of any allegations of sexual misconduct until College Park police found the girl days later in a motel . The judge said she learned about the allegations directly from Sheats , who called her shortly after police had found her . Since then , Hickson said , she had heard nothing from police or the girl 's mother about the alleged sexual incident . <p> In a statement to College Park Police Sgt. C.M. Burke , Shamila said she fled Sheats ' house because he forced her to have sex .

He declined to talk about the case , saying it is under investigation . <p> Jones said she was called to the U.S. Attorney 's office in January to discuss her daughter 's allegations . " I did talk to his supervisors , and they denied all the allegations , " Jones said . <p> Jones said she was never asked if she wanted to press charges against Sheats . " They did n't say anything about that . No , not at all , " she said . <p> After her arrest in College Park , Shamila was returned to her home but ran away again . She was found in Las Vegas working as a prostitute at a Greyhound bus station earlier this month . <p> Langford said he learned of Shamila 's allegations against Sheats last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Las Vegas . <p> " One of the first things she asked her mom was whether anything had happened to the individual that she reported to police , " said Langford . <p> Langford suggested Shamila may have run away again after learning that Sheats was still working at his job . <p> At Tuesday 's news conference , Langford and City Councilman Derrick Boazman lambasted authorities for not fully investigating the case . <p> " Did nobody take this child seriously ? " Langford thundered . " We call on U.S. Attorney Richard Deane to leave no stone unturned , and if the allegations are true , to take every step to deal with it .
