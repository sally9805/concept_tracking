I waddle through the back lot of Paramount Studios , six months pregnant with my second child , Miss Katie . She kicks and rolls as I wend my way in the dark to the restaurant where I am meeting two young writers to discuss a possible new film project . // It is the winter of 1979 . The air is cold and damp . I am tired . I gather my coat around my big belly as I approach this landmark eatery where the old ghosts of Hollywood hover and the new players meet , share ideas and gossip unceremoniously about one another . // I 'm at the end of a long week spent on a dark looping stage , re-creating every word I spoke in my last film , Trip with Anita . I am sick of looking at myself day after day trying to make the words fit in my mouth as each scene moves along silently with just a click track in my headphones . Thank heavens it 's almost over and I can just concentrate on having my second baby and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // Maybe it 's not too late to make my marriage work , I think to myself . Maybe if I spend less time working , doing films back-to-back , and more time at home with Daddy Bill and little Oliver , we 'll be okay . If my new production company takes off , giving me a little more control over the movies I star in and can make for other people , then I can rein back a little . // I open the door to the restaurant and see Nancy Meyers and Charles Shyer sitting in a booth near the window . They are animated , energetic , inspired and full of youth . I like them immediately . // " Hey , thanks for coming all the way into Hollywood to meet with me , " I say as I peel off my coat and slump heavily into the seat opposite them . " I 've been looping all day on this film I did in Italy last year . They do n't use sound over there . Go figure . " // We laugh about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The menu comes , and I order my weekly dose of liver while my companions jump right in explaining what they 're up to . // " We 've been working on this idea for a script and want to talk to you about it ... to see if you and your company might be interested in helping us get it made . We 'd like you to play the lead role . " // I settle into my seat , ready and eager to hear . // " Okay , guys , shoot . " // " It 's a story of a spoiled Jewish girl named Judy Benjamin who joins the Army on an impulse after her husband drops dead on their wedding night , " Nancy says . // " While making love , " Charles chips in. // I laugh out loud . " Oh my God , that 's funny . Really funny . Then what ? " // " Well , of course , she 's a fish out of water in the Army , " Nancy continues . " She ca n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She ca n't wait to get out and go back to her comfortable life . But , guess what ? " // " What ? " I 'm on the edge of my seat . // " When the chance finally comes , she decides to stay . " // I laugh and laugh as they tell me the whole story . I ca n't believe what I 'm hearing . The concept is so fresh , so brave and original . The female lead carries the whole movie , almost by herself . She embarks on a personal journey and becomes empowered and independent and strong . It could n't be more different from my last movie . // I can feel a flutter of excitement in my belly that has nothing to do with my baby . This is a dream role for any actress . My fatigue melts away and my heart races at being asked to play one of the best characters I have ever been offered . // " What 's the film called ? " I ask Nancy and Charles . // " Private Benjamin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my baby resting on the tops of my thighs , I shift in my seat , wondering , praying Judy Benjamin will wait for me. // Finally , I pop the question . " When do you plan on shooting this ? " // " We are n't sure yet . We want to write the script on spec first . " // " Oh , I see . " I nod . " You have n't even written it yet ? " // They glance at each other . " No , that will take some time . And , anyway , we wanted to find out if you were available first . When 's the baby due ? " // " In three months . She 'll be born at the end of April , actually . " I stroke my belly , happy at the prospect . // Charles and Nancy nod to each other and smile knowingly . " Well , that would work out really well . " // " Great ! " I exhale , over the moon . " Then count me in. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we walk in opposite directions to our cars . It 's late , but I 'm no longer tired . Reaching my car , I turn . " Who do you have in mind to produce , by the way ? " // " No one yet , " they call back across the parking lot . " We were going to wait until the script is finished . " // " Well , you know what ? " I yell back in the dark . " Maybe we could do this ourselves . Maybe we do n't need another voice in the mix right now . " // " That 's what we were thinking . " // I lower myself into the front seat of my Mercedes and start up the engine . Heading for home , I wonder what on earth I 'm letting myself in for . // * * * // Warner Brothers bravely agreed to go with our triad as the only producers attached to Private Benjamin . The executives were not only trusting that two women and a man could produce this film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman going into the Army bringing a good financial return . The Hollywood film industry at that time was still controlled by men . // But none of us even thought of that as a problem or perceived any glass ceiling at the time . Not at Warner Brothers , anyway . Bob Shapiro , the head of production , loved this movie and what it had to say . He told us from the outset , " If I ca n't make this film , then I want to be first in line to see it . " He was a source of such support during the usual obstacles all films come up against in the long process of production . // It was such an exciting time for all of us . We moved into our offices on the Warner Brothers lot and began to build the dream team that would , we hoped , bring this wonderful script to the silver screen . We needed everything from a director and cast to a cinematographer and set designer . We needed to look at actors and locations , costumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd given birth to my perfect baby girl . // I drove joyfully to our offices almost every day , packing my tiny Kate in her little car seat , her bottles and cereal in my bag , along with a few rattles and toys and her fold-up playpen . Oliver was in preschool , and his nanny looked after him when I was n't there . It was so great having Kate gurgling away in the office with us in the midst of the hustle and bustle of pre-production . // We found ourselves a wonderful director , Arthur Hiller , who had directed The In- Laws . For reasons I was never sure of he dropped out He was a good man , and there were no hard feelings . It was difficult , however , to find another director at that stage of pre-production . As fate would have it , we were crossing the streets of the back lot on our way to lunch one day when we ran into a friend of Nancy and Charles 's : Howard Zeiff. // " Hey , Howard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nothing right now . " // The three of us looked at each other and smiled . " Nothing ? Really ? How would you like to direct our new movie ? " // So there goes another Hollywood story . Howard Zeiff became our new director . // Happy and fulfilled , my life seemed almost perfect . I only wished there were two of me : the Goldie who could continue to be successful at my work and live the life I loved outside the home , and the Goldie who could be at home cooking and enjoying the domestic side of life that I also cared so deeply about . I battled with myself over these two roles constantly , trying to balance both , but somewhere deep inside I knew that I could n't win this one . There was never enough time in the day to accomplish my dream of having it all . // Sometimes I 'd get home much later than I might have wished and was unable to meet everyone 's demands for attention . Some nights I raced home just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that my marriage was suffering as a consequence . The struggle of juggling all this was an enormous burden to bear , and the guilt relentless . The icing on the cake was the slight chance that this film would be a great big fat success . But I also feared that possibility . I knew that if it was a success , my obstacles would only be harder to overcome . The pressures that would put on my already fragile marriage would be almost insurmountable in this business where one party always feels left out of the parade . // But I was on this fantasy ride at Disneyland and I could n't jump off . For one thing it was way too much fun , and secondly , the train had already left the station . // * * * // The film was a bigger , fatter success than I could ever have imagined . Not only was it the great creative collaboration of my life but the most thrilling time in my professional career . The movie opened at the theatres with more acclaim than anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine . There was no male star to carry the picture , as they say , as was usually the case . If ever I had suspected how life changing this movie would be for me , I could never have guessed how much . // Everybody suddenly wanted to interview me . I made the cover of Newsweek . I was touted as the Hollywood actress who broke the rules , broke box office expectations and trailblazed a new path for women , especially for actresses who wanted to produce films for themselves and for others . // I was happy but at the same time worried at this superinflated image the media seemed to have created of me . I was n't the only producer on the film . Nancy and Charles did more , than I did . But because the media decided it would be so , I became the face of female power in Hollywood , even though Nancy is the one who has gone on to write , produce and direct huge box office hits like What Women Want and Something 's Got ta Give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // My marriage finally cracked under the pressure , and the double-edged sword of my supposed new power in Hollywood stuck in my side . I 'd only feared what success could do to destabilize my home life , I had n't considered the reaction within the industry . It was increasingly more difficult for me to be simply an actress for hire . I kept hearing things like , " But Goldie does her own films . " Even though I met many wonderful , strong directors with great roles to offer , none of them hired me . I began getting a complex thinking that they did n't want to work with me , when , in truth , they just did n't want the baggage of " Goldie Hawn . " This realization was so crushing to me. // There were several fallow periods that followed , and many times I looked back and felt the bittersweet sting of Private Benjamin . Of the films I have made since then , some I have produced and some I have not . I 've worked alongside some very good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fearless in arguing points with studio heads I have felt strongly about . I have made some friends and I 've made some enemies trying to help make my films be as good as they can be . Sometimes I was right to share my vision and sometimes I was wrong . My only hope was that a great collaboration would be sparked , and that ego and fear would be left outside the door . // But my passion and commitment to work was no longer tempered by the fear of not being liked . My tenacity and determination to be true to the person I had become was sacrosanct . I guess I came to know this about myself : for better or worse , I do n't give up . //
