On Fifth Avenue , in lower Manhattan , at the corner of Eleventh Street , stands the First Presbyterian Church , a gloomy edifice made of blackened sandstone . Should you turn there and walk along West Eleventh , you will pass the row house the Weather Underground blew up while dabbling in explosives , then the New School 's glass and steel building , and finally Gene 's Restaurant and the back dining room of Charlie Mom 's , where couples glumly eat sautTed broccoli and mu shu pork . <p> Cross Sixth Avenue to West Tenth Street , past where the old Jefferson Market courthouse stands on an island , its clock tower a finger raised to the sky and its booming note a reminder to passersby that they are either late , on time , or free of such cares . <p> West of Seventh Avenue the cross streets run off at a southerly angle . With this shift comes a sense of entering another New York , an older and less orderly one . The names of the streets change as well , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inns . The noise of traffic recedes . Sparrows chitter in the trees . <p> The remaining Federal townhouses of the West Village keep company with every conceivable architectural fad : high Victorian apartment blocks with Gothic porticos , brick cottages with a galleon in stained glass on each window , stolid Civil War-era merchant 's houses with stables behind , engine companies with arched red doors , twenties white brick garages and brownstones . Most of the buildings have an expensive , well-groomed air but a few tenements survive , bra-zenly declaring their poverty , their stone facades coated in dingy beige paint and a row of dented trash cans chained to their front . <p> Go a little farther and you 'll cross Bleecker Street , with its boutiques and French pastry shops . Near the end of the next block stand a pair of fine old brick townhouses . One has a blue door with a tarnished brass knocker in the shape of a dolphin . The other is empty . A handsome sign declares it For Sale . The Cavendish Group , it reads , Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number is obligingly given below . <p> From the house with the blue door , a bang and a clatter comes from the narrow kitchen area below the street . The door opens and a boy with long reddish hair hauls out a carton . " Seven , eight , " he counts as he drops bottles from the carton into a bin , the bottles clanking . He shakes his head and goes back inside . <p> Clumping , making as much noise as possible , as is the nature of boys , he climbs three flights of stairs to the attic floor . There he flops down on one end of the blue leather sofa in front of the TV , which is blank . <p> " Eight , " he announced to his sister , who sat at the other end of the sofa . " Eight in one week . She 's drinking like mad again . " <p> " Uh-huh , " Deen said , not really listening . <p> " I 'm gon na draw a picture of her liver , all green and purple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe I 'll do one of her puking it right out . " He took a pad of paper and a box of colored pencils from the table and began some preliminary lines . <p> " Hey , Deen ? " <p> " Yeah , Hamish ? " <p> " You have noticed she 's acting pretty weird again lately ? When 's the full moon , do you know ? " <p> " No . Oh , I get it . Okay , I 'll check  --  the paper 's right here , hang on a sec . Oh geeze , it 's Saturday . " <p> " Aw , shit ! And she always drinks more on weekends . What if she goes bonkers again with the pills and all , and this time they do n't pump her stomach out in time ? What if she dies and we 're poor pitiful orphans and have to be adopted by some Mormon family or something , some people who do good works and all that shit , and you 'll have to wear gingham dresses down to your ankles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Geeze , Hames , what 'd you eat for breakfast , a bowl of raw paranoia ? Munster 'll be fine . She only lost track of how many pills she 'd taken that one time . Besides , Uncle Brian would adopt us . " <p> " Yeah , then why 'd she bake a tennis shoe for dinner last night ? With tomatoes , for Christ 's sake . " <p> " Okay , " Deen said wearily . " I tell you what  --  we 'll get up in the middle of the night to check on her . We can take turns . I 'll find a little mirror to hold over her mouth to make sure she 's still breathing . " <p> Hamish responded with a dissatisfied sigh . He began a new drawing . Deen went back to her book . <p> " Hey Deen ? " he said . " You think we 'll grow up to be like them ? " <p> " Lushes and pill poppers , you mean ? Or junkies ? " <p> " I 've got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " Be my guest . I 'm sure it 's highly scientific . " <p> " Well , it is . It 's this : You and I got Pops 's hair , right ? And sort of his looks . And Gretchen 's got Munster 's hair and totally her looks . So Munster 's crazy and drinks and Gretchen 's crazy , so that means you and I are more likely to turn out like Pops . " <p> " Dead of an overdose at thirty-nine ? Thanks , Hames . But I 'm happy to inform you that it 's not all that simple . For one thing I 'm going to be a classical pianist , not some crazed rocker . And Munster and Gretchen are crazy because Pops died . You and I are n't , because we were too little to miss him . " <p> " I guess . So what do you think I 'll be when I grow up ? " <p> " I du n no . You 're too young to tell yet . An artist of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Pops dead in the hotel room . I made his skin just ever so slightly green , see ? " <p> " It 's pretty good . You think he really made that big a mess in the room when he died , though ? " <p> " Naw , he ran around messing everything up before . " <p> <br> Continues ...
