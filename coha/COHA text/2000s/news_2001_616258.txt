<p> Florence , Italy Standing majestically in its alcove in this Tuscan city 's Gallery of the Accademia , Michelangelo 's " David " is the marble embodiment of physical perfection , a biblical figure as a Greek god . <p> His sling draped over his shoulder of his nude body , he gazes into the distance , as if in focused anticipation of his battle with Goliath , over the heads of the visitors who stand quietly in groups around him , looking up reverentially at the monumental , 18-foot tall sculpture . <p> " I was n't prepared for how I 'd feel , " says Carrie Watson , an 18-year-old Nashville student on a school tour of Italy and Greece . " It 's a lot more breathtaking than you expect it to be . " <p> Denver tourists Ken and Sharyn Landis are just as awed . " When you think he did this when he was 29 . . . " muses Sharyn . " He was a quite a genius . " <p> Most visitors , whether first-timers or those returning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " David " near the top of their priority list . Not only a landmark of Western art , the sculpture is practically synonymous with Florence . Although it was intended to adorn the Duomo , the church that dominates the skyline , city elders decided to place it in front of the Palazzo Vecchio  --  city hall . It became the embodiment of Florentine civic pride and republican spirit . A copy stands there today , and another David looks over your shoulder as you take in the breathtaking view of the red-roofed city from the Piazzale Michelangelo . <p> The sculpture 's prominence and symbolism , even in Michelangelo 's day , must have pleased him greatly . Although he lived intermittently in Rome and spent the last 30 years of his life there , he grew up in Florence , and this art-bedecked city shaped his aesthetic and intellectual outlook . <p> " The only work he ever signed , the Vatican ' Pieta , ' carried the words ' Michelangelo the Florentine ' on the strap of fabric across the Virgin 's chest , " says scholar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Michelangelo : Drawings and Other Treasures of the Casa Buonarroti , Florence . " " Certainly , he felt more at home in Florence than anywhere else . " <p> The fruit of his Florentine art education and outsized talent is on display in museums and churches across town . In this eminently walkable city , you can see the sculptures , drawings , architecture and painting in a few packed days . But why stop there ? If you can dismiss the tour brigades , the cars and ATM machines , you can envisage the irascible artist striding through the narrow city streets . You can make a tour of the art he admired , the buildings he lived in , spots of importance to him , and get a sense of the magical place Florence was during the Renaissance , when art , intellect and commerce came together in a golden era . <p> THE EARLY YEARS <p> The Santa Croce district on the east end of the city core bookends the tour . The Buonarroti family , originally from Caprese , moved into this neighborhood in 1485 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bentaccordi No. 7 and Via dell ' Anguillara marks the site , which is only a few blocks from Santa Croce church , where he is buried in a lavish marble tomb . He would have visited the church in his youth , if only to admire the 14th century frescoes by Giotto , the artist who initiated the Florentine tradition that would flower in the early Renaissance . <p> But then , art that he could admire and learn from was everywhere . Thanks to the patronage of local guilds and wealthy families like the Medici , who would be Michelangelo 's most important patron , the work of the giants of the early Renaissance were as plentiful as billboards in Atlanta ( obviously to much greater aesthetic satisfaction ) . <p> I like to imagine him walking by the Orsanmichele , admiring the sculptures in their starry niches around the church . He would have paused at " St. George , " by one of his heroes , Donatello . ( It 's a bronze copy ; the original marble is in Florence 's Bargello museum . ) Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a short walk from there to the Baptistery and Lorenzo Ghiberti 's sculptural reliefs for the east doors , which Michelangelo described as " so fine they might fittingly stand at the Gates of Paradise . " For these dramatic biblical scenes , Ghiberti employed the newly discovered principle of perspective and modeled his figures after ancient Greek and Roman sculpture . Today , a permanent crowd of tourists stands around the door , even though it is a copy . ( To see the original panels , visit the Museum of the Opera del Duomo , behind the church . ) <p> Michelangelo 's talent was recognized early . At 13 , he served for a year as an apprentice to Domenico Ghirlandaio , from whom he learned the arts of fresco and tempera . Some scholars think he might have even painted portions of the frescoes at Santa Maria Novella near the train station . But sculpture was always his first love . At 14 , he was recruited for a sculpture school that Lorenzo de Medici started in his garden near the San Marco convent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the convent is famous for deeply religious frescoes by early Renaissance master Fra Angelico . You can also see the small apartment of Savonarola , the fiery monk whose preachings and republican politics influenced the young artist , perhaps exacerbating the lifelong conflict he felt between his spirituality and his sensuality . The rooms are filled with memorabilia and art , including a painting depicting Savonarola being burned at the stake in 1498 . <p> Lorenzo de Medici was so taken with Michelangelo that he invited him to live in his palazzo , not far from the school and garden . The budding artist 's two years there were formative because Lorenzo , an intellectual and an aesthete , hosted a continual salon of the day 's important thinkers and poets . You ca n't tour all of Palazzo Medici-Riccardi , but you can visit the garden where Lorenzo installed Roman sculptures that Michelangelo would have admired and you can spend time in the private chapel . A world unto its own , it is covered with a wondrous fresco by Benozzo Gozzoli , which depicts the Medici family participating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabited by leopards , camels and other wild beasts . <p> To see what Michelangelo accomplished as a teenager , head to the Casa Buonarroti . There you can find his earliest existing sculptures : a delicate marble relief of the Madonna and child ( a bronze copy is in the Atlanta show ) , which represents his spiritual bent , and " The Battle of the Centaurs , " an almost three-dimensional tangle of nude bodies that bespeaks the influence of antiquity . <p> Michelangelo bought this property in 1508 , and lived on the site briefly . ( Do n't look for his bed ; the buildings have been considerably altered since then . ) The casa includes residential rooms lavishly decorated by descendants with the art of their day and museum-style galleries , which house works by Michelangelo and art collected by his family . There is a rotating exhibition from a collection of 180 drawings and a gallery full of small models . Two of its unique holdings are the " River God , " a monumental torso that is the only surviving large-scale model , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Lorenzo , a sculptural composition of classical ornament considered by one architect to be among the great unbuilt projects of the world . <p> OLTRARNO DISTRICT <p> Walking in Michelangelo 's footsteps will take you across the Arno River to the Oltrarno district . This quiet section of Florence is home to two churches important to the artist . Santo Spirito is an exemplar of rational , carefully proportioned Renaissance architecture by Brunelleschi , whose work was a starting point when Michelangelo took up the building arts . Maybe even more important , he visited the church hospital ( now gone ) , where he advanced his understanding of the human body by dissecting corpses . For an artist whose ideal was the male nude , " anatomy was destiny , " writes art historian Howard Hibbard . To thank the prior of Santo Spirito for allowing the dissections , he carved a wooden crucifix in 1493 . Although there is some dispute as to its authenticity , a sculpture featuring an atypically slender Christ , which hangs in the church , is thought to be that gift . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frescoes in Santa Maria del Carmine . This artist was one of the early leaders in depicting people with muscles and bones , and Michelangelo studied his work carefully . <p> SAN LORENZO <p> You 'll want to devote a good block of time to touring the San Lorenzo complex . Michelangelo 's creative spirit flowers here in his greatest sculptural ensemble , the Medici Chapel , and another major architectural project , the Laurentian Library . These projects occupied him on and off from 1519 to 1534 . He even moved to the neighborhood and carved the marble sculptures on the site . <p> The tomb is a grand and sober monument to Giuliano and Lorenzo , son and grandson of Lorenzo the Magnificent . Idealized sculptures representing the men sit calmly in their niches , looking in the direction of a pensive Madonna with the Christ child . Twisting figures representing " Day , " " Night , " " Dawn " and " Dusk " recline uneasily on the tombs below . They suggest something of the artist 's tortured soul or his view of life on earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elaborate statement . Like many of his projects , he left it unfinished , and his followers assembled it . <p> For a more private glimpse of Michelangelo 's soul , make a special request at the chapel ticket booth to see the sotteraneo . You will get a slip of paper with a time written on it . Head to the guard at the back of the chapel . He will let you in to a cavelike basement room discovered in 1975 where Michelangelo hid during political turmoil in 1530 . Using pitch from a torch , he let loose with a torrent of drawings . The overlapping jumble of figures evokes the tension and pent-up energy he must have felt . <p> Michelangelo 's talent as an architect is evident in the Medici Chapel and the Laurentian Library , which was built to house the Medici manuscript collection . The reading room is a long , quiet , orderly space , which contrasts with the dramatic volume of the vestibule . Here Michelangelo turns traditional Renaissance architecture on its ear , setting columns into the walls , playing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of the stairway as a major architectural element with broad curving steps that cascade into the space . You could say the vestibule is as muscular as his figures . <p> Michelangelo left his beloved city in 1534 and spent the rest of his life in Rome . But Florence is the repository of a poignant sculpture of his last years , the " Florentine Pieta " in the Museum of the Opera del Duomo . It expresses the spirit of an octogenarian facing his mortality . This is a personal pieta ; the figure of Nicodemus , who holds the dead Christ , bears the artist 's features . The Madonna tenderly touches her cheek to his in a very human expression of grief . <p> Michelangelo was a lion of a man , revered in his lifetime , a man of great accomplishment . But he also suffered great frustrations , like uncompleted projects , and the burden of his perfectionism . He angrily broke the left leg of this piece when he discovered a flaw in the marble . <p> Michelanglo died in 1564 and was buried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchants to smuggle the remains to Florence . The artist 's biographer , Vasari , designed the tomb adorned with a bust of Michelangelo and the statues " Painting , " " Sculpture " and " Architecture " that sit mournfully beside the casket . <p> Although Michelangelo has been gone for more than four centuries , his spirit is very much alive , and not just in his art . It is woven into the fabric of the city he considered home .
