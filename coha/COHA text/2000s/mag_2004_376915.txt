Swarovski shed its image as the source for animal miniatures by teaming with trendy fashion designers like Alexander McQueen on the runway . Now the century-old crystal company wants to revamp lighting . " The chandelier is this luxurious , celebratory lighting fixture , " says Nadja Swarovski , 34 , who runs communications for the firm . " We challenged designers to reinvent it for today . " Twenty- seven of them accepted the dare , and this month seven of the collection 's 17 pieces  --  including Yves Bhar 's Nest , above , a glowing cyclone suspended by strands of crystal , and Matali Crasset 's Plexiglas Sky  --  were displayed at the Art Basel fair in Miami . All the fixtures are for sale through Swarovski . Karl Lagerfeld already bought one , though at $7,000 and up , the prices cast their own shadow .  --  By Kate Novack
