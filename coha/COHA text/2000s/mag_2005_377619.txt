The same activists who helped introduce the world to dolphin-safe tuna are about to take consumers on a similarly gruesome guilt trip . In an effort to abolish Canada 's government-sanctioned seal hunts , in which pups as young as 12 days are fair game to get clubbed to death , the Humane Society of the United States and other animal-rights groups will launch a campaign this week to pressure Americans to boycott all seafood from our neighbor to the north . With a kickoff scheduled for March 29 , the official starting date of Canada 's seal hunt , the Humane Society is printing tens of thousands of bumper stickers and pledge forms to be distributed at supermarkets and restaurants across the U.S. And thanks to unrelated legislation , the U.S. will begin enforcing a law on April 4 that requires labels on fresh and frozen seafood to identify its country of origin . <P> As the seal population has climbed back up to historic heights , so too has the demand for pelts in a few countries . Most of the hunt is conducted in economically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an important part of their income , " says Geoff Regan , Canada 's Minister of Fisheries and Oceans . But animal-rights activists are betting that because the U.S. buys nearly two-thirds of Canada 's exported seafood , a boycott will inspire the industry to end the hunt . They also contend that Newfoundland , a former whaling hub that now makes a bundle from whale watching , can overcome the economic disruption . " That kind of cultural shift has happened before , " says Canadian environmental activist Rick Smith . " We can do the same with seals . "  --  By Julie Rawe .
