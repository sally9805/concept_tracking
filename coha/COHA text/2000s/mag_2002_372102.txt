Like most doctors , I 've watched with concern the growing use of so-called club drugs  --  psychotropic substances that catch on from time to time among teenagers and young adults and become the rage at dance clubs and all-night raves . I know about ecstasy , Rohypnol and ketamine . But I was taken by surprise last week when Noelle Bush , daughter of Florida Governor Jeb Bush ( and the President 's niece ) , was arrested in Tallahassee trying to buy Xanax , having allegedly borrowed the name of a retired doctor and called in a bogus prescription . Xanax , after all , is a widely prescribed antianxiety medication  --  a cousin of Valium  --  and hardly fits the profile of a Gen X party drug . <P> Xanax is usually used to relieve panic and anxiety , which may be why Noelle wanted it . But though it ranks low on the scale of drugs most likely to be abused ( heroin is termed a Schedule I drug ; Xanax is a Schedule IV ) , the Drug Enforcement Administration has been keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benzodiazepines , it acts on the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid , decreasing brain activity and producing a drowsy or calming effect . " It 's like being drunk , without the toxicity of alcohol , " reports a helpful chat-room participant . <P> It 's also quite addictive . " Xanax is extremely potent , " says Dr. Steven Juergens of Virginia Mason University , who was the first to write about Xanax addiction , in 1988 . " It acts quickly on the brain and has a short half-life . " Users of such drugs tend to come back for more and more . Xanax is also used by partygoers as a " parachute " drug to bring them down from the effects of stimulants such as ecstasy . It 's this combination of drugs , suggests Dr. Herbert Kleber , a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University , that may account for the current interest in Xanax . <P> Benzodiazepine abuse is on the rise , according to the Health and Human Service 's Drug Abuse Warning Network . But so is prescription-drug abuse generally . From 1990 to ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of Americans who started misusing sedatives nearly doubled , while abuse of pain relievers rose 180% . <P> We do n't really know what Noelle Bush planned to do with those 40 Xanax pills in the prescription or even whether she was getting them for herself . Her parents issued a terse statement acknowledging that the family is " deeply saddened " and reminding Americans that " substance abuse is an issue confronting many families across our nation . " Noelle 's mother Columba should know . As a board member of the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University , she has helped raise awareness about the problem . Sadly , nothing she 's done over the years has attracted nearly as much attention as her daughter 's arrest . <P>  --  With reporting by Jonathan D.
