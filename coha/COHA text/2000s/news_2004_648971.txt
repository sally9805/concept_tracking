<p> Alex Rodriguez guessed that he watched five innings of the World Series last month . Figure one inning of every painful game , then toss in another stray inning of torture . Then it was time for Rodriguez to punch the remote , punch the couch or punch anything . <p> It was a brief yet depressing viewing experience because it was the first time Rodriguez truly believed he would be in the World Series . The Yankees were one victory away when they disintegrated against the Boston Red Sox . Rodriguez was part of that unprecedented debacle . He could not watch what unfolded next . <p> " What 's the right word ? " Rodriguez wondered . " Masochist ? I did n't want to be a masochist watching those games . " <p> It was a typically gorgeous sunny afternoon as Rodriguez lounged in his spacious office here . The flat-screen television was tuned to a President Bush speech , the blue rug with the Yankee logo was centered and the photographs were neatly arranged . He had just finished working out with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any day . <p> In the freshly manicured world of A-Rod Inc. , everything seemed seamless . But , of course , not everything was . Three weeks after the Yankees faded in four straight losses and two weeks after Rodriguez barely watched the Red Sox shelve 85 seasons of misery , Rodriguez settled on the villain in this tale . He looked in the mirror and never stopped staring . <p> " The fact that I got what I got , I deserved every bit of it because I was brought here to help win a championship and we did n't get that done , " Rodriguez said . " Therefore , we failed . I do n't think you can point your finger at any one guy because we win and lose as a team . But if you had to point a finger , I think you would point it right at me . " <p> Rodriguez 's assessment came like a line drive at a shallow third baseman since it was in response to a question about being despised by the Red Sox ' fans . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praying that the Red Sox would acquire Rodriguez from the Texas Rangers . <p> After Rodriguez stressed how much he loved being on stage in New York and how much he relished getting to pursue vindication against Boston , he vilified himself for not delivering a championship . <p> The words sounded like the way George Steinbrenner , the principal owner of the Yankees , would want Rodriguez to respond . Be the big man , take the blame and try and reverse the results , even if Rodriguez also sounded like a martyr . <p> " I 'm going into next season with a mentality to make it revenge time , " Rodriguez said . <p> But , for now , forget that Mariano Rivera was three outs from burying the Red Sox in Game 4 and that the Yankees were six outs away in Game 5 . Forget that Curt Schilling muzzled the Yankees in Game 6 and that Boston mauled Kevin Brown in the decisive game of the American League Championship Series . <p> Push the details aside , Rodriguez said , and blame the new guy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ball out of Bronson Arroyo 's glove , the guy who Schilling has turned into a pinata and the guy who went to the Yankees instead of the Red Sox and wound up on the dismal end of what had been the most lopsided rivalry in baseball history . Until Rodriguez arrived , that is . <p> " I knew what I was getting into it here , " Rodriguez said . " I love that it 's all or nothing . When I say point the finger at me , it 's the way I feel about my responsibility . It comes with the territory . " <p> Rodriguez sounded like a masochist and a martyr when he gave his critique of himself for an ordinary debut season as a Yankee . Rodriguez batted .286 with 36 homers and 106 runs batted in , nice but not overpowering statistics , and made a smooth transition from shortstop to third . But he was 0 for 7 with runners in scoring position in the A.L.C.S. , was 2 for 17 in the last four losses and was booed at Yankee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the infamous slap . With Derek Jeter on first , Rodriguez trickled a ball about 40 feet toward first in the eighth inning of Game 6 . Arroyo scooped it up near the foul line and reached to tag Rodriguez because no one was covering first . <p> Rodriguez slapped down on Arroyo 's left arm and the ball shook loose and dribbled into right field . Jeter scored to slice the Yankees ' deficit to 4-3 and a Boston collapse was brewing . But Rodriguez was called out for interference , the rally was squelched and the criticism of the slap started . <p> " That was junior high school baseball right there , at its best , " Schilling said . Schilling also criticized Rodriguez for not having class and repeated his jabs in several interviews . For the first time , Rodriguez responded . <p> " Anytime he says something about me it 's a compliment , especially when they 're in their championship parade and they 're still thinking about us , " Rodriguez said . " The one thing I hope is that he continues to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give us great motivation to beat the Red Sox in the future . " <p> As Rodriguez carefully selected his words , he was seething . He is miffed that Schilling , who made several recruiting calls to Rodriguez about joining the Red Sox after Schilling was traded there last November , has blasted him so incessantly . <p> But , when Rodriguez was asked if the words hurt , he said : " Absolutely not . Red Sox are not supposed to like Yankees . " <p> Then Rodriguez declined any more questions on Schilling . While Rodriguez described how Schilling maligned him and the Yankees , Schilling has essentially tossed all of his criticism at Rodriguez . <p> If the Yankees had not blown a 3-0 lead in the best of seven-game series , Schilling presumably would not have been as chatty . Rodriguez said the Yankees might have subconsciously thought they were safe and removed their hands from Boston 's throat . All that did was move the hands to their own throats and keep Rodriguez searching . <p> " The fact that I have n't won a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do , I will not sleep or be comfortable with my career . <p> Rodriguez stayed at Yankee Stadium until 3 a.m. after Game 7 of the A.L.C.S. Too angry to leave , he dragged a chair into the middle of the clubhouse and sipped a beer . Bernie Williams and Mike Mussina were with him . <p> For a while , they were numb , then aggravated , then ornery . Rodriguez said they spoke about how the Yankees could " never let this happen again . " <p> As the minutes and the beers disappeared , Rodriguez and Williams laughed about being like Rambo and returning bigger and better in 2005 . It was cold and dark when Rodriguez left for home , which is how his mood has remained . Rodriguez does not want to be a masochist , but he can not turn off the mental pictures with a remote . <p> " Obviously , what will make it better is coming back next year and winning a title , " Rodriguez said . " But I 'll never forgive myself or my team . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have lost four games in a row to anyone . That disappointed me . That should n't have happened .
