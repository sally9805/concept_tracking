W. 'S KIN : NEW AMBASSADOR TO GUYLAND ? <P> For all the Bush clan 's power , the phrase " looks fine in calendars " is not often said of its members . But LAUREN BUSH , 17 , the President 's niece , is the cover girl of next year 's legendary Pirelli Calendar , a collection of top-shelf babe portraiture that the tiremaker sends to customers and celebrities . " She was selected as a tribute to America after the Sept. 11 attacks , " said a Pirelli spokeswoman , because she " epitomizes America and all it stands for .

" But experience in musicals made him ready for at least one scene that called for a " double-up at the piano , " as he puts it .

Along with dirt on drug-crazed bandmates ( " No different than your dad , who , when he comes home , gets drunk and becomes a moron , " he tells TIME ) and his relationships with Cher and Diana Ross ( " I loved both women , " he says , " and of course my problem , my blessing and my curse is that I love all women " ) . Still , he hastens to add , " Everything I 've ever done is really because America and its people have given me a chance to do it .
