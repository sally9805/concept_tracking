Some 2,000 G.O.P. donors will be in Washington for Tuesday night 's Presidential Gala fund raiser . But the big ticket is dinner at DICK CHENEY 's vice-presidential mansion the night before , an event planned with as much secrecy as the report of his energy task force . Among those on the Veep 's guest list are some of the party 's most prolific fund raisers , including lobbyists for the coal , oil , natural gas , nuclear and utility industries . Rick Shelby of the American Gas Association , who raised or gave $250,000 , is invited , as is former Republican Party chairman Haley Barbour , who lobbies for the huge coal-based utility Southern Co. and the firm of Cassidy &; Associates , whose clients include Exxon , Texaco and Pennzoil . It 's a stretch to link their fund raising and the Bush Administration 's energy plan , but the timing is a p.r . nightmare : the Vice President breaking bread with energy lobbyists just four days after giving a boost to the industry . <P> Republican National Committee spokesman Mark Miner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a payoff is " misinformed . " Indeed , nonenergy executives dominated fund raising for the Bush gala and will be in abundance at the Cheney dinner , for which there is no price of admission . And while previous donors of at least $175,000 will be present at Cheney 's home , they have contributed nothing to the Bush bash the following night . Still , comparisons to the Clintons ' use of the Lincoln Bedroom seemed inevitable . " Is the Vice President 's mansion the latest perk ? " asked a G.O.P. veteran . <P> Criticism of Cheney 's style has also come from within the Administration , since an April speech in which he seemed to mock conservation as a means of dealing with energy shortages . Top Bush aides did not see the speech until the day he delivered it . Even though Bush and Cheney are in complete agreement , the difference in tone between Cheney 's blunt speech and Bush 's conciliatory one last week was stark . By last week Bush aides were happy to have regained control of the energy-policy rollout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road to help sell the plan were scrapped . Energy Secretary SPENCE ABRAHAM is scheduled to do most of the airport shuttling . Until last week internal copies of the energy task force 's 176-page report had a cover bearing the vice-presidential seal . But when the report was officially released , the presidential seal was in its place . <P>  --  By Michael Weisskopf , James Carney and John F. Dickerson/Washington
