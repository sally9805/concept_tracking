<p> PORTLAND , Ore .  --  Sherrita Myers has overcome many challenges to create a thriving child care center in her home . They 've ranged from minor headaches ( Play-Doh down the garbage disposal , Barbies in the plumbing ) to major hurdles , such as a lack of capital and business experience . <p> Myers ' success is a tribute to her tenacity and the city of Portland 's intensive efforts to help low-income workers build assets . <p> " Without them , I think I would have been shut down long ago ; I would n't own my house , " says Myers , 28 , who has increased her monthly earnings to $5,000 from $1,000 several years ago . She 's now saving for future needs , with each dollar she deposits in a special account matched two to one . <p> Myers is part of an expanding effort , including a new push by the Federal Reserve , to help low-income workers build wealth . The idea is to help people move out of poverty or up the financial ladder by starting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asset-building strategies include no-closing-fee home loans , financial education , ATM-type stored-value cards and support for microenterprises  --  firms with five or fewer workers needing $35,000 or less in capital , which often do n't have access to commercial banks . Individual Development Accounts ( IDAs ) , offering a one-to-one , two-to-one or better match for every dollar saved , also hold promise . Matches can come from government or private sources . <p> The drive for assets is as old as the nation , but the issue has a new urgency . The personal savings rate has plunged into negative territory . Government welfare programs have been cut . Financial holdings remain tightly concentrated . The top 1% of the population has about a third of the nation 's wealth , while the bottom half owns less than 3% . <p> New Fed data show some signs the wealth gap is growing : the median net worth ( gross assets minus liabilities ) of non-Hispanic white families rose 6% to $136,000 between 2001-2004 but was basically flat for African-Americans at $20,000 . Research has shown that African-American and Hispanic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial assets , such as stocks . At least 10 million people have no bank account , including many Hispanics . <p> Central bank officials are so concerned that the 12 regional Fed banks have launched a joint effort with Washington non-profit CFED , ( originally the Corporation for Enterprise Development ) to develop strategies for asset building . Regional Fed banks are hosting meetings around the country , bringing together such big names as Citigroup , Bank of America , Harvard and the Ford Foundation and smaller non-profits and firms . <p> Two sessions have been held , with three more planned this year , including a meeting at Fed headquarters in Washington , D.C. <p> " As Americans , we believe in the fundamental concepts of savings , homeownership , higher education for our children , and a comfortable retirement ... but for many people  --  especially those with low or moderate incomes  --  these are luxuries , abstract and unattainable , " Philadelphia Fed President Anthony Santomero told a December forum sponsored by the New York , Philadelphia and Boston Fed banks . <p> Financial security certainly seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who hit bottom several years ago , disabled and dependent on federal aid . <p> Pothier is now launching a business making coverlets for people who are in wheelchairs or spend a lot of time outdoors , such as hunters and sports fans . Her enterprise has been financed partly with an IDA and other aid via the non-profit Lane MicroBusiness . <p> " To me , even $25 makes a difference in , ' Oh , I can eat something different than rice and beans this week . ' When you 're already low on the totem pole , you can just go up , " says Pothier , who made her first substantial sale to a Japanese firm . <p> Building assets is key <p> Financial assets  --  savings , checking or retirement accounts , stocks and bonds  --  and non-financial assets  --  a car , home or business  --  can spell the difference between security and drift . Assets mean access to college education , the ability to open a business , buy a house , have a secure retirement and a hedge against job loss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They may have a good job and a good income , but if they do n't have assets " they are at risk , says David Foster , policy strategist at Oregon Housing and Community Services . <p> Despite a history of entrepreneurs and such asset-building laws as the 1862 Homestead Act and 1944 GI bill , U.S. wealth remains concentrated by income and race . <p> Andrea Levere , president of CFED points out that many tax breaks for savings and retirement go mainly to the well-off . Low-income workers are denied access to social programs if their assets are above certain thresholds . <p> A study by the Pew Hispanic Center found that in 2002 , Hispanic households ' median net wealth was just 9% that of non-Hispanic white households . Recent Fed research shows that about 20% of black families had no type of non-financial asset in 2004 . While that 's an improvement from 24% in 2001 , it compares with less than 5% of non-Hispanic white families . <p> At the same time , the median net worth of black families with business assets was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ median for all black families , Fed Vice Chairman Roger Ferguson said in a speech on the data . <p> Average net worth of blacks rose faster than for whites in the period , as the number owning homes and businesses rose . Because the ownership is relatively narrow , the median did n't change , Ferguson said . <p> Valerie Plummer , executive director of the Oregon Microenterprise Network , says asset development is not just about alleviating poverty , but also about economic development . About 17% of U.S. businesses meet the definition of a microenterprise . Many business owners have skills but lack capital . <p> Ron Tate , 52 , runs Tate Insurance Services in a Portland office with a shelf of trophies from youth football teams he has coached . After working for another insurance firm , he expanded his business several years ago with $3,000 from Mercy Corps Northwest microloan program . " My credit score was n't that good ; I knew I was n't going to get ( money ) " from a bank , says Tate , who has paid off his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I might have some needs coming up , " he says . Still , given his firm 's small size , he adds , " I 'm not sure whether a regular bank will help . " <p> Does it work ? <p> The asset development movement has been quietly expanding since the 1980s . Today , there are hundreds of IDA programs around the country , serving tens of thousands of borrowers , predominantly women and minorities . More than 500 microenterprise programs provide counseling and capital to a quarter of a million people a year . <p> While the programs serve a tiny slice of the population , there is evidence they make a difference . Portland officials work with local businesses and other institutions to provide health care , legal aid , insurance , and financial aid and counseling to people making 50% or less of the area 's median income ( $33,950 for a family of four ) . The goal was to raise business revenue by at least 25% over three years . In the past 16 months , revenue at 268 microbusinesses is up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country right now have a poverty-reduction program . ... Most are hung up on the trickle-down economic approach , " says Lynn Knox of Portland 's Bureau of Housing and Community Development , who says the economy is rigged against the poor . <p> A study by the non-profit Aspen Institute found more than 72% of low-wealth entrepreneurs increased income in five years . Rates on Mercy Corps microenterprise loans average 11% ; the default rate is about 10% . The higher interest rate reflects the riskier loans . <p> Banks are becoming more engaged in IDA and microlending . One reason : The efforts help them meet legal obligations to lend to underserved areas . In Oregon , Plummer has been meeting with private banks to create a rural loan fund for microentrepeneurs . <p> Businesses are also stepping up . The Association for Enterprise Opportunity is working with the eBay Foundation on a pilot program to help individuals who want to start online businesses . It also has projects with other major firms . <p> Still , the San Francisco Fed , in an asset development publication , notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstration project or could n't save more than $100 . Many who did save set aside about $25 to $35 a month , not enough for a home down payment or major purchase . <p> The programs are expensive to operate , with IDAs costing as much as $850 to $2,000 per participant . The overhead costs of administering the loans , including training for recipients and other services , are high and , so far , hard to recover . <p> As the asset-building movement has grown , there has been a surge in payday lenders , check-cashing firms and high-cost subprime lenders . More capital is available in low-income areas , but it 's often found in pricey loans that strip assets , Alfreda Norman , community affairs officer at the Dallas Fed , says . <p> " There are people who are poor because of discrimination , both in the labor market and in the credit market , and for those people , this ( asset development ) undoubtedly would work , " says William Spriggs , chairman of Howard University 's economics department . " Given what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that might affect more people would be to combat discrimination in credit in general , " he says . <p> While the Fed is interested in using asset development programs partly to combat poverty , a number of clients served by microlenders do n't fit the profile of the long-term poor . In Portland , some of the most successful people using the Mercy Corps program have college educations or professional backgrounds but were unable to get help from a commercial bank . That means success rates might be influenced by the fact that some who flourish need only minimal aid . Overall , most of the Mercy Corps loans are to women and minorities . <p> Savings and lending programs also help those trying to rebuild their lives . Symon Lee , 40 , owner of Furever Pets in Northeast Portland previously had a career as an industrial designer . In 2001 , after family illnesses , Sept. 11 attacks and layoffs at his firm , he took a new path , opening a pet store in northeast Portland . He turned to Mercy Corps in 2003 ; it helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has paid off his $17,000 loan , expanded and has one part-time and two full-time employees . " Ultimately , our goal is to produce our own products  --  this for me is a stepping stone , " Lee says . <p> Jennifer Richardson was a sculptor in New York City who came down with a chronic illness after the attacks . In and out of hospitals and bankrupt , she made her way to Portland . With the help of a $7,000 Mercy Corps loan , she opened Jennie Greene Floral Designs . " I had an idea , but I was n't eligible for a ( bank ) loan , " says Richardson , who has met her loan payments . PHOTOS , Color , Alan S. Weiner for USA TODAY ( 2 ) PHOTOS , B/W , Alan S.
