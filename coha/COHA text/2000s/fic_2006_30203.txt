Real Time By Kass , Pnina Moed Clarion Books Kass , Pnina Moed SUNDAY , APRIL 9 5:00 AM Thomas Wanninger Departure Terminal , Schonefeld Airport ( SXF ) , Berlin " Thomas Wanninger ? " " Yes . " " Traveling alone ? " " Yes . " " First trip to Israel ? " " Yes . " " Passport , please . " I hand it over . He opens it . He looks at the passport photo , looks at me , looks at the photo . " Born in Germany ? " " Yes . " " What is the purpose of your visit ? " " I " ll be a volunteer at a kibbutz . " " Which kibbutz ? " " Broshim . It " s outside Jerusalem . " " Can you show me proof of that ? " I unzip my backpack and stick my hand in . I can feel the sports magazine , the guidebook . I look sideways insidethere " s a pack of tissues , some stuff from school I " m supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . junk . . . where did I put the letter from the kibbutz ? I see him watching me as if I " m some kind of suspect . Suddenly I thinkhe " s not going to let me on the plane . " Maybe you should empty your backpack , Thomas ? " I slide the backpack off my shoulder and squat on the ground . He isn " t taking his eyes off me for a minute . Another guy comes over , looks at me , and then whispers something into his ear . He nods and shows this guy my passport and airplane ticket . The guy walks away . My T-shirt is sticking to my armpits . Everything is on the floor . Then I see the pale blue information booklet and the letter is sticking out of it . " Here it is . " I hand it to him . I " m still squatting , waiting . He looks at it , reads it . " Okay , put your stuff back in . " I jam everything into the backpack and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I did . " " Did anyone give you a gift or a package or any item to deliver when you arrive ? " " No . " " You " re sure about that ? " " Yes . " " Do you have any relatives in Israel ? " " NoI " m not Jewish . " I want him to believe me . He looks at me like he doesn " t . " For your information , there are non-Jews living in Israel . There are Christians , Muslims , Greek Orthodox , Drusedo you want me to continue ? " He doesn " t wait for my answer . He looks at me , lifts the suitcase , turns it around , sees the yellow security sticker , puts it down . " Do you speak Arabic ? " " Arabic ? No , of course I don " t know Arabic ! " " All right . I " m just asking . " " Well , I don " t know Arabic and I don " t know Hebrew . I speak German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And English . " By now I " m sure I " m not going anywhere . In an hour I " ll probably be back home . The people in line behind me are staring at me . Like I have a rash , like they " re going to catch something from me . No one " s missing a single one of his questions or my answers . And then suddenly he hands back my passport , my ticket , and the kibbutz letter . Doesn " t smile , just says , " Okay , you can go . " It " s over . He starts questioning the person in line behind me . Whatever he thought of me , of my passport , of what I looked like , it " s history now . I can get on the plane . * * * 5:45 AM Thomas Wanninger El Al flight 01 : SXFTLV ( BerlinTel Aviv ) The seat belt sign blinks red , the airplane engines start to roar , the plane begins to taxi . The flight attendants are walking down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , checking seat belts . Somewhere in the front of the plane a baby is squealing and then beginning to cry . I see the mother start to get up , but the flight attendant points to the lit seat belt sign . She sits down again . I " m watching and listening to everything , I " m hyped up . Everything around me looks like it is in fluorescent lights , and sounds are funneling through me on high volume . I " m going to a place I don " t know , to find out something that no one at home knows , and if anyone thinks I " m calm , they " re wrong . I " ve flown only once before , on a school ski trip . But it isn " t the same this time , I " ll be entering a war zone . And I " m alone . There are flight announcements about the altitude of the plane , the weather , and perfume and cigarettes that will be sold duty free . Maybe I " ll buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then the pilot announces the estimated time of arrival . The plane reaches the end of the runway and lifts off , tilting away from the ground slowly with almost no angle . It " s six o " clock in the morning . Four more hours and I " ll land in Israel . The announcement continues : " Local Israeli time is one hour ahead . " I change the time on my watch . I " ve left German time behind . I have the whole row to myself . I stretch my legs and stare out the window . The plane is cruising over the city . Berlin is concealed behind a thin veil of rain . Through the morning darkness I can see the dots of highway lights and the snaking line of traffic . Mutti must be in her car , driving in one of those lanes leading away from the airport . She probably won " t go back homeshe hates an empty house . If I know her , she " ll go to the office , or travel to one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her boss . Mutti has to be busy . She says , " When I work , I forget . " The plane starts a steep climb , moves through clusters of clouds , and then pulls out into clear sky . Past my own reflection in the window it " s all blue air , the color of early morning . Beyond the wing the blue is beginning to lighten . Somewhere the morning has started . It will be late morning when I arrive . The engines become a monotonous drone . I unzip my backpack and take out the pamphlet . I don " t bother unfolding it . I " ve read it and stared at the pictures a hundred times . The green rolling Judean Hills , the distant outlines of Jerusalem , the orderly row of red-roofed kibbutz houses , the auditorium , the guest hostel where I " ll be staying . To myself , and only to myself , I am willing to admit I " m scared out of my mind . Not to Mutti , not to Rudi , even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Christina . The time off from school wasn " t tough to get . The principal is really hot on us going to Israel . No generation of Germans should forget is his motto . The real reason I " m going is my business . And I can " t be a coward . So here I am , about to land in a country where bombs go off every five seconds . Why am I doing this ? Because I " m looking for information about a Nazi . My grandfather . One more time I read the letter I showed the security guy : " Shalom , Thomas ! Welcome to the SEEK program ( See-Explore-Educate-Know ) at Kibbutz Broshim , located outside Jerusalem . Our mailing address is Kibbutz Broshim , Doar Na 832 , Jerusalem , Israel . Since you indicated an interest in agricultural work , we have arranged for you to work in the hothouses and plant nursery . Kibbutz Broshim exports flowers , and your help will be greatly appreciated . You will be instructed by Baruch Ben Tov , a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I " m supposed to do when I land , though I know them by heart : " After landing and passing through Passport Control , look for someone holding a " SEEK " sign . This will be Vera Brodsky , who lives at Kibbutz Broshim and will be your " buddy " during your stay . Vera will be waiting for you inside the arrivals terminal of the airport . In case of any change , call 02-994-3242 . " I shift around in the seat and feel the bulge in the back pocket of my jeans . The airplane ticket and passportI forgot to put them back in the zippered pouch of my backpack . That " s all I need , to lose my ticket and passport . The passport is dark red , with a stiff cover and a gold embossed eagle in the center . Printed underneath the eagle emblem , in big letters , is BUNDESREPUBLIK DEUTSCHLAND . I run my fingers over the spread wings . Eagles are birds of prey , aren " t they ? Why does a German passport have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird of prey , waiting to lunge and capture , maybe to kill ? I flip open my passport to the inside page : FAMILIEN NAME Wanninger NAME Thomas STAATSANHRIGKEIT Deutsch GEBURTSTORT Berlin The photo at the left of the typed information is me : unsmiling , brown eyes opened wide by the flash of the camera , short hair , and part of a white T-shirt . A high school kid who looks older than sixteenat least that " s what people tell me. * * * 6:45 AM Interrogation room , police headquarters , Jerusalem POLICE OFFICER : You understand you " re not under arrest , don " t you ? OMAR JOULANI : If you say so . POLICE OFFICER : Of course we say so . Why would we lie ? We just want information . You live in the same village as Sameh Laham , right ? OMAR JOULANI : No , in Jabel Fahm . And you know it . You know everything . But we go to the same high school . When there " s no curfew . It " s our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in school today ? OMAR JOULANI : How can I be in school if you brought me here ? Anyway , I don " t go to school . Instead I work . I study at night . you ? Your buddy , Rashid , said you were the best student in chemistry class . OMAR JOULANI : Rashid is a liar and a stinking little thief . You have him in jail , and he " ll say anything . POLICE OFFICER : He says you know how to explode bombs , Omar . He says you have a real touch with them . You get high as if you " re on drugs when you make them . OMAR JOULANI : You " re trying to get me to say I " m one of thosea shaheed . I won " t say it . I " m not . I sell vegetables with my grandfather . POLICE OFFICER : Where is Sameh ? OMAR JOULANI : I told you , I don " t know . Go to the Jewish man who is his boss . POLICE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No one ever heard of Sameh . So , Omar , it seems your best friend has disappeared . ( Suspect looks at the floor and does not respond . ) POLICE OFFICER : Three days and no one knows where he is . OMAR JOULANI : Sameh has a cousin in a village near Jerusalem . Maybe he went there . POLICE OFFICER : What is the name of the village ? OMAR JOULANI : I can " t remember . POLICE OFFICER : Try . Try very hard . OMAR JOULANI : Please let me go home . I " m sure Sameh will show up today . You " ll see . POLICE OFFICER : Why do you say that ? Why are you so sure ? OMAR JOULANI : They are without food in his family . He must work . POLICE OFFICER : We can keep you longeryou know that . OMAR JOULANI : I know that . But I know nothing . Nothing . Please . POLICE OFFICER : Release him . * * * 6:45 AM Baruch Ben Tov Kibbutz Broshim , Judean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrival throws me back into the past . He " s not the first German student to come here , but he " s the first who will work in the flower fields and hothouses . The first who will be under my supervision . Of course I was consulted . Will you mind working with a German boy , Baruch ? I was asked . No , of course not , I answered . I am a member of the kibbutz and will do my share . But I am uneasy . What will this Thomas Wanninger say when he sees the number on my arm ? Will he foolishly apologize ? Will he speak to me in German ? Does he know I speak German ? It is an intrusion in my life . I will speak to him in English . The sun has risen , warming the air and making the last of the night sky very light . I hear the birds speak to each other , the dew hangs transparent from each petal , the sprinklers whirr in the still spring air . I always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour . No one is here . I can say , " Rachel , Ruchele , " and no one hears me . Her name is my morning prayer . Rachel was wonderful with her hands . She would have planted sunflowers and dahlias , petunias , daisies , everything . Even in the room under the roof she painted flowers on the enamel plates we ate from . Her hands were like the wind and her imagination endless . She turned the attic into our palace . What she would have made of this solitary place , this small house I live in ! And booksgoodness , how she loved books . Continues ...
