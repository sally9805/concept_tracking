X-ray astronomy opens a new window on the most energetic cosmic events <p> Part one of a two-part series on recent findings in X-ray astronomy and on its future <p> <p> When it comes to recording the hottest , most violent , and most bizarre interactions in the universe , X rays win hands down over visible light . During their normal aging process , stars and galaxies give off lots of visible light . But whenever galaxies collide , stars explode , or chunks of matter plunge into massive black holes , they emit a torrent of X rays , which are 100 to 1,000 times more energetic than the light you can see . <p> Getting high-quality images and spectra of X ray-emitting objects is n't easy . Unable to penetrate Earth 's atmosphere , this high-energy radiation can only be detected by spacecraft . Even then , X rays are notoriously difficult to focus into an image since they tend to be absorbed , rather than reflected , by telescopes ' mirrors . <p> Until the summer of 1999 , the best X-ray images that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were only three times as sharp as the visible-light observations that Galileo made nearly 400 years ago by looking through a new device called a telescope . <p> In July 1999 , however , NASA launched the Chandra X-ray Observatory , a $1.5 billion satellite that can resolve X-ray details 10 times more sharply than any previous mission could . Indeed , the clarity provided by the new observatory rivals what all but the very best ground-based telescopes can produce with visible light . Last December , the European Space Agency launched the X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission ( XMM ) - Newton observatory , which has a lower resolution but can see dimmer objects than Chandra can . <p> Already , Chandra has scrutinized supernova explosions as never before and found evidence of a new type of black hole . It has also resolved the myriad point sources that make up the cosmos ' X-ray background . Spectra taken by XMM-Newton have provided the best data yet on the supermassive black holes that lurk at the cores of galaxies . <p> Together , these two instruments are creating a new era in X-ray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see sharply and deeply enough in the X-ray spectrum to solve some long-standing mysteries and uncover some new ones . <p> Right from the get go , Chandra has been providing answers to questions that have long puzzled astronomers . For its first official quarry , the observatory examined a 320-year-old supernova remnant-an expanding shell of gas hurled from an exploded star . Astronomers had expected that the star would have left behind a superdense , burned-out cinder at the core of the remnant , dubbed Cassiopeia A. Previous X-ray missions , as well as observations with radio and visible-light telescopes on the ground , revealed no such object , however . <p> One hour after staring at Cassiopeia A , some 11,000 light-years from Earth , Chandra found a central dot of X-ray light . It appeared to originate from a collapsed star of the type called a neutron star . Such an object has a density 50 trillion times greater than that of lead . <p> " Everyone knew there should be a neutron star there , but no one had seen it , " notes Andrea H. Prestwich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " With Chandra 's resolution , suddenly it was there . " <p> " We were astounded by the images , " says Harvey N. Tananbaum , Chandra science director at Harvard-Smithsonian . " We see the collision of the debris from the exploded star with the matter around it ; we see for the first time shock waves rushing into interstellar space at millions of miles per hour ; and , as a real bonus , we see for the first time a tantalizing bright point near the center of the remnant that could possibly be a collapsed star associated with the outburst . " <p> Using calculations based on the intensity and distribution of the X-ray emission , Deepto Chakrabarty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and his colleagues suggest the object might be a magnetar , a neutron star with an enormous magnetic field of 100 trillion to 1,000 trillion gauss . Astronomers so far have found evidence for only a handful of magnetars . <p> If many supernova remnants turn out to be magnetars , the finding would require " a dramatic revision of our generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supernova remnants , " Chakrabarty and his colleagues say in an article scheduled to appear early next year in the Astrophysical Journal . <p> In the Jan. 10 Astrophysical Journal Letters , another team of astronomers considered the same observations of Cassiopeia A from another viewpoint . They reported " the first unequivocal identification " of newly forged iron in a young supernova remnant . Scientists think that the heavy metal arises from a chain of nuclear reactions that begins deep within the core of an exploded star . <p> That 's a nice confirmation of the standard theory of supernovas . But there 's a surprise , too . The knots of iron found by the team lie at the outer edge of the expanding remnant , much farther from the core of Cassiopeia A than the silicon atoms do . Even though the iron was forged in the star 's deepest layers , where temperatures reach 5 billion kelvins , it somehow sped ahead of the silicon , which was generated farther from the core in a region 2 billion kelvins cooler . It 's as if the exploded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results require that a spatial inversion of a significant portion of the star 's core has occurred , " says John P. Hughes of Rutgers University in Piscataway , N.J. , and his coauthors . Hughes says the findings argue against the prevailing notion that a supernova explodes in an orderly , symmetric fashion , with its outermost layers staying ahead of the innermost ones . <p> " It 's fair to say that when you put on the sharper glasses of Chandra , you find out that many of the assumptions that you had made before about supernovas were just wrong , " notes Richard F. Mushotzky of NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md . <p> Soon after studying Cassiopeia A , Chandra cast its X ray eye on another supernova remnant , the famed Crab nebula . The explosion that gave birth to the Crab was so bright that Chinese observers in A.D. 1054 viewed the spectacle in daylight . <p> The Chandra images show a brilliant ring encircling the spinning neutron star at the heart of the nebula , which lies about 6,000 light-years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Arizona State University in Tempe , may help explain how a spinning neutron star transports its energy into surrounding space . " It 's like finding the transmission lines between the power plant and the light bulb , " he says . <p> In another burst of new findings , researchers announced last month that Chandra appears to have collected evidence for a new type of black hole . Observing the galaxy M82 over a period of 8 months , Chandra found a bright , concentrated source of X rays about 600 light-years from the galaxy 's center . The intensity of the source increased dramatically between last January and March . <p> The concentration of light and its brightness , which is equivalent to the luminosity of 18 million suns , indicates that the X rays are being produced as material heats up and falls onto a black hole . No ordinary black hole , this one has an estimated mass of between 500 and 8,000 suns , says Philip E. Kaaret of Harvard-Smithsonian . That 's a range that astronomers have never encountered before . <p> Supermassive black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several billion times the mass of the sun ; individual stars that collapse under their own weight to become black holes are as massive as a dozen suns . The new find " is the best case yet for a midsize black hole , " says Douglas O. Richstone of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor . " This object is the missing link . " <p> No one is certain how either midsize or supermassive black holes form , he adds , but the existence of the midsize objects may ultimately " lead the way to a formation mechanism for the big ones . " <p> Kaaret notes that M82 is a starburst galaxy : It contains an abundance of massive stars . Such stars are born , age , and die all within the astronomically brief time of a few tens of millions of years . His team suspects that the dense starburst activity may have created the midsize black hole , possibly through the collision of several newborn stars or stellar black holes . <p> The researchers suggest that midsize black holes may be common in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black holes , like the starbursts , are young . As the midsize black holes grow older , they may either stop feeding on hot gas and fade or sink into the nucleus of their home galaxy , becoming part of a supermassive black hole . <p> On an even grander scale , supermassive black holes figure in another puzzle solved by Chandra . For nearly 40 years , astronomers have tried to identify the origin of the faint glow of X rays that bathe the sky . Chandra 's sharp vision has resolved this glow into millions of individual sources . Many of them , Chandra reveals , are active galactic nuclei-galaxies whose cores contain massive black holes . <p> " You look at a given patch of sky with Chandra and our best optical telescope . We can see 10 times more active galactic nuclei with Chandra , " notes Mushotzky . " Chandra sees essentially all the massive black holes that there ever were , which I think is a pretty nifty discovery . " <p> Curiously , a few of the sources of X rays show no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 36 ) . One explanation is that these objects are extremely distant . Because of cosmic expansion , distant galaxies recede faster from Earth than nearby galaxies do and , as a result , the light they emit is shifted to longer , or redder , wavelengths . The puzzling objects might lie so far away-at the very edge of the observable universe-that the visible light they radiate is completely shifted into the infrared . <p> Because looking far back in space is the same as looking far back in time , galaxies that distant would be among the first to form . <p> Why should the very first galaxies shine so brightly with X rays ? If black holes formed the seeds around which galaxies coalesced , they would readily emit X rays as matter falls into them , Tananbaum notes . <p> Says Mushotzky , " The big thing we 've learned in the last 2 years from the Hubble and the Keck telescopes in Hawaii , and now Chandra , is that massive black holes and the galaxies they reside in are intimately related to each other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ galaxy come first , or does the massive black hole become the seed around which the galaxy will originate ? " Mushotzky wonders . <p> " Chandra homes in on the nucleus of a galaxy , while Hubble and other telescopes are exquisitely sensitive to star formation , and by combining observations , hopefully we 'll figure this out , " he says . " The best argument is that . . . the black hole at the center of a galaxy and the galaxy-formation process are one and the same . " <p> Several years ago , researchers using a Japanese X-ray satellite called ASCA explored other properties of supermassive black holes . They found a new way to probe the extreme-gravity environment around these black holes . Ionized iron atoms emit X rays of particular wavelengths that show up as a sharp peak in the recorded spectrum . But in the vicinity of a black hole , these peaks broaden , or stretch . The amount of stretching , the scientists found , appears to be proportional to the mass of the black hole and its spin . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the core of two galaxies suspected of harboring supermassive black holes . Steven M. Kahn and Masao Sako of Columbia University and their colleagues have now found stretching in three additional emission features : narrow bands of X-ray light produced by carbon , oxygen , and nitrogen ions . The researchers attribute the distortion to a black hole 's tug . <p> According to models , the regions responsible for the emissions lie just above and below the swirling disks of material surrounding black holes . The radiation is likely to provide vital information about the nature of the superdense objects , Kahn says . As with the iron emission , the amount of stretching may indicate the size and spin of the black hole . <p> Because the newly found emission features are brighter than those of the iron emission , they should be easier to detect , he notes . Kahn 's colleague , Graziella Branduardi-Raymont of University College London , reported the findings last month at a meeting on X-ray astronomy in Palermo , Italy . <p> Chandra achieves its superior vision through four nested mirrors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $250 million . XMM-Newton uses a trio of telescopes that focus on the same object . X-ray telescopes require such complicated optics to avoid absorbing the radiation . This design allows X rays to graze a mirror , like stones skipping across water . At an angle of less than 1degrees , they can reflect and converge to produce a focused image . <p> Although , Chandra and XMM have already made great advances , X-ray astronomy is just starting to hit its stride . Astronomers predict that by combining the light of a network of observatories , they will ultimately be able to see details 1 million times better than they can with Chandra . <p> At NASA 's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville , Ala. , a laboratory model of such an array has achieved about the same resolution in X rays as the Hubble Space Telescope can attain in visible light , researchers reported last month . <p> That work has given a kick start to two proposed X-ray missions that would rely on a fleet of X-ray detectors . If these missions come to pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see distant stars not as points of light but as bona fide disks , showing details as rich as we can now discern on the sun . A fleet of such devices would be the first to peer down the throat of a black hole , taking an image of hot , X ray-emitting gas swirling around the hole just before it disappears down the hatch . <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : NASA 's Chandra X-Ray Observatory .
