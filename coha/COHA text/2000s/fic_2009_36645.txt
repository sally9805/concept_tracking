When it 's over , he stands back to survey his handiwork . <p> Almost . <p> He reaches out with a gloved hand to adjust the sleeve of her pajama top , pulling it lower on her wrist . <p> Better . <p> He pushes back a few strands of her hair , the better to assess the frozen grimace on her mouth . <p> Ah . Very nice , indeed . <p> He pries open the corpse 's clenched right fingers . First , he slides the silver signet ring from the pinkie and puts it aside . Then he unzips the pocket of his down jacket and pulls out a plastic Ziploc bag . <p> Painstakingly , he deposits the contents of the bag in the palm of her hand . Then he closes her fingers again to form a fist . <p> Good . This was a last minute idea-a nice little twist to keep them all guessing . To let the almighty Lucinda Sloan know that she no longer has control over her own life . <p> That he controls her now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he dredges it through the puddle of blood . He seals it into the Ziploc , dripping red , and puts the bag back into his pocket . <p> And now , the grand finale . <p> He takes out a tube of lipstick , uncaps it , gives it a twist , and pauses to admire the slanted , waxy tip . <p> Then he runs it over the dead woman 's lips , staining them a scarlet shade to match the pool of blood in which she lies . <p> There . <p> You 're perfect , darling . <p> Her gaping eyes seem to be fixed on his face now in vacant , terrified recognition , belying the fact that she never saw him coming . Not until the last moment . <p> They never do . <p> He takes one long , last look ; then , satisfied , he leaves her . <p> Just before closing the door behind him , he snakes a black glove around the doorjamb to turn off the light , leaving her alone in the dark . <p> She wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have before , either . <p> For all he knows , she was never afraid of the dark . <p> But some people are . <p> Some people are terrified . <p> Outside , he takes her house key-a duplicate of the one he 'd brazenly borrowed from her purse in an unguarded moment-and slides it under the WELCOME mat . Just to make things a little easier , when the time comes . <p> You really have thought of everything , he congratulates himself . <p> He pauses momentarily at the foot of the driveway to leave behind another calling card , placing it in a spot where it probably wo n't be discovered right away-if ever . <p> But it 's there . <p> He always plays by the rules . <p> At least , when it comes to his own little game . <p> He chuckles softly as he slips away into the night beneath the light of a full moon . <p> * * * <p> Gazing out the passenger 's side window at the Federal brick row houses lining the cobblestone street , Lucinda reminds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she does . <p> Philadelphia 's Society Hill is safe , convenient , historic , beautiful ... and very few people know to look for her here . That 's the important thing . <p> In the midst of the media attention following the Hastings case , her phone number and address were leaked on the Internet . She was inundated with phone calls and drop-in visitors seeking her help . Families of missing persons from all over the country , private detectives-even a few furtive law enforcement agencies that made it clear she was their last resort . <p> She moved last month , got an unlisted number and a new e-mail address . <p> It is n't that she no longer wants to work as a psychic detective-or that people have n't offered exorbitant fees for her services . <p> On the contrary , she does n't charge at all . She does n't have to , thanks to family money . She lives very comfortably off the interest of her trust fund . <p> But there are only so many people she can help , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bullard of the Philadelphia Police Department tells the families of missing persons about her , and brings her on board if they 're interested . <p> They usually are , regardless of whether they believe in this stuff . People whose loved ones have vanished are desperate enough to try anything in order to bring them home . <p> " Here we are , " Jimmy Molinero , at the wheel beside her , announces as they pull up at the curb beneath the exceptionally dim yellow glow of a lamppost . <p> Some people probably find the district 's old-fashioned street lights charming . Lucinda will take the bright white wattage of modern fixtures any day . <p> " Home , sweet home . " Jimmy puts the Mercedes into park and gestures up at the three-story brick townhouse . <p> Lucinda murmurs in agreement , reluctant to admit that she feels about as at home here as she did on the Dutch Antilles island of Curatao , where the two of them just spent the long President 's Day weekend . <p> Their rented Caribbean villa was picturesque and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't comfortable . She could n't quite relax , despite day after leisurely day spent in abundant warm sunshine with attentive staff doling out cocktails mixed with the island 's namesake liqueur , the same inviting shade as the sparkling Caribbean Sea . <p> Truly , there was no reason for her not to feel as though she had landed in paradise . <p> It was n't the place , though . <p> It was the company . <p> She gazes out the window at her building , bathed in the soft white glow of a waning moon and a luminescent dusting of snow . <p> She 's been anxious to get back here practically from the moment she left . Now that she 's arrived , she finds herself inexplicably on edge . <p> But-like it or not-this is her home now . And it was almost like coming full circle , settling into the second floor apartment of a nineteenth century townhouse in one of the oldest-and probably wealthiest , too-neighborhoods in the Northeast . <p> Not that Lucinda herself has ever lived in this particular area before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancestors once inhabited these elegant , centuries-old homes , going right back to Philadelphia 's Colonial days . <p> " Your mother will be thrilled when she finds out where you 've landed , " her friend Bradley commented when he helped her move in . <p> " That 's why I 'm not going to mention it . " <p> Bradley knew the deal with her family , having also grown up in-and been expelled from-Main Line society , albeit decades earlier . <p> He peered at her over the cardboard dish carton he was holding . " Pretty childish of you , do n't you think , darling ? " <p> " Absolutely . But I ca n't help it . " <p> Bitsy Sloan has a way of bringing out her daughter 's unreasonable , petty side . <p> " I do n't suppose you 've got any of that pretty blue liqueur hanging around your kitchen for a nightcap ? " Jimmy asks her , obviously interested in prolonging their long weekend . <p> " Fresh out , " Lucinda says quickly-maybe too quickly , judging by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just kidding . I did n't actually think you had- " <p> " Oh , I know . Listen , I do have coffee , " she offers . " If you want to come in for a cup . " <p> After all , Jimmy went all out this weekend : plane tickets to the island , meals at the nicest restaurants , a chartered diving trip to Bonaire .... <p> Poor guy . <p> He means well . <p> He just is n't ... <p> An image of another man flashes into Lucinda 's brain . <p> She sighs inwardly . <p> Okay , so Jimmy is n't Randy . <p> But Randy is n't here ; he 's a two-hour drive away from Philadelphia , on Long Beach Island . And God knows he is n't available . <p> Jimmy-a good-looking , twice divorced corporate lawyer with two teenaged daughters-is . <p> He deserves a chance , remember ? That 's why you made yourself go out with him in the first place . <p> She and Jimmy met entirely by chance , literally bumping into each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Year 's . They both had their heads bent against a bracing wind , both happened to be running late , both apologized profusely-and moved on . <p> " We 've got to stop meeting like this , " she heard a voice say a few days later in a Starbucks a few blocks from there , as she was waiting for her triple shot mocha with triple whipped cream . <p> She looked up and-surprise ! - there he was again . What a coincidence . They chatted over coffee , and she was pleased when he asked her out . Particularly since he had no idea who she was-heiress to the Sloan fortune , or otherwise . <p> In the wake of last summer 's media splash , she 's had her share of attention from guys who wanted to date a Sexy Soothsayer Superhero . All of them had turned out to be opportunists in one way or another , not unlike the gold diggers who pursued her in her privileged youth . <p> Jimmy was pleasantly clueless . He did n't recognize her from the papers or television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't ask , " Are you one of the Sloans ? " <p> It was n't until she left Starbucks that she started having second thoughts about accepting Jimmy 's invitation to go to dinner . As the date drew nearer , she found countless excuses why she should n't date him . She actually called to cancel at the last minute , but lost her nerve when his voice mail picked up . <p> The first date was fine . It led to an impulsive second-and more retrospective reluctance on Lucinda 's part , but she convinced herself she was just out of practice . Dating one of the most eligible bachelors in Philadelphia was n't such a horrible idea , given the state of her love life . <p> And now , six weeks later , here they are . <p> Not necessarily a couple ... but a little too close for Lucinda 's comfort . <p> " Coffee sounds good . Do you have decaf ? " Jimmy asks hopefully . " Because I do n't drink caffeine after four o'clock . It keeps me up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't want that . <p> " No decaf , sorry . " <p> It 's the truth , she notes , defending herself ... to herself . <p> Not that she ca n't offer him some other decaf beverage . . . but to his credit , Jimmy gives up more easily than she expected . <p> " Then I guess I 'd better get going . I should call my kids and tell them I 'm back in town , and I 've got to unpack and repack for a business trip . " <p> Maybe he , too , is aware that there 's just no chemistry . <p> He insists on escorting Lucinda and her luggage inside , leaving the silver Mercedes idling at the curb . Not necessarily a great idea in any urban neighborhood , but if she points that out , he might take it as an invitation to turn off the ignition and stick around after all . <p> Anyway , she 's noticed that he treats all the trappings of his wealth with the same casual disregard . He 's got money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucinda introduced the two men just last week . <p> She had n't necessarily expected the crusty old detective to hit it off with a guy whose idea of dressing down is exchanging black wing tips for black Gucci loafers . In fact , maybe that 's why she had impulsively suggested that her longtime colleague-and , okay , father figure-join her and Jimmy for lunch at Morton 's that day . Maybe she wanted a good reason to stop seeing a perfectly nice guy . <p> Neal , who has lived all his life over in Two Street , and for a good part of it raised a large , tight-knit family on a police detective 's shoestring budget , was n't thrilled to see Jimmy leave most of his Porterhouse entree on the plate . <p> " Erma could turn that hunk of beef into cheese steak sandwiches to feed all my kids and grandkids for a coupl'a days , " he later grumbled to Lucinda , who is well-acquainted with-and impressed by-Mrs . Bullard 's domestic thrift . <p> Naturally , she welcomed the criticism with a quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " <p> " I did n't say that . " Neal raised a bushy white eyebrow at her . <p> He knows her too well . Knows Randy , too . The three of them worked dozens of missing persons cases together back in the old days , before Randy moved away to Long Beach Island . <p> She told Neal all about what happened out there last summer , of course . All except the part about sparking old feelings for Randy . <p> But she did n't have to elaborate . <p> Neal is a wise old guy . <p> And Jimmy is a nice , not-quite-as-old-though nearly a generation older than Lucinda-guy , and in the end , she could n't come up with a good enough reason not to go away with him . He 's well-traveled , well-mannered , well-spoken . A natural athlete , he skis , plays tennis and golf , and owns a sailboat he keeps moored-coincidentally-on Long Beach Island . <p> " You 'll have to come sailing with me when the weather gets nice , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Randy . <p> Then she wondered whether she 's going to spend the rest of her life doing this-comparing every man she meets to the one who got away . <p> Lucinda flips a light switch and picks up her mail in the lobby , then she and Jimmy climb the steep , narrow staircase . At the top , she pulls her keys from her pocket , juggles the mail under her arm , and reaches for her bag . <p> " I can take that from here , thanks . " <p> " Oh , I 've got it . " <p> " But your car is running . " <p> " That 's good for the engine , after sitting idle in the cold parking lot for days . And what kind of jerk would I be if I made you carry your own bag ? " <p> " It 's not that heavy , " she reminds him-echoing his own words when he lifted it from her bed before they left for the airport on Friday night . <p> " I 've never seen a woman pack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , with admiration-still carrying the bag . <p> She should n't be irritated that he did n't hand it over . He 's just being polite . <p> But Lucinda likes to do things for herself . <p> She gets the impression that Jimmy 's two ex-wives and teenaged daughters do not . And that they travel with suitcases full of resort wear in tow , unlike Lucinda , who figured a weekend in the Caribbean required nothing more than a couple of pairs of shorts , flip flops , and a bathing suit . Which was true . Although , when she found herself wearing the same T-shirt to the pool a few days in a row , she figured she might have underdone it , just a little . <p> Jimmy did n't seem to mind that Lucinda had n't been entirely outfitted by Tommy Bahama before the trip . In fact , he kept complimenting her on whatever she was wearing . He also complimented her on being so low-maintenance . And , one night when she 'd had too much rum , he actually complimented her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his overall sincerity . <p> Too many compliments . <p> There are worse problems , she reminds herself . <p> As a rule , she does n't do guilt . Yet somehow , Jimmy manages to bring it out in her . <p> " What does your week look like ? " <p> " Crazy , as usual . " Not really . She sticks the key into the deadbolt . " How about yours ? " <p> " Crazy , as usual . I 've got to fly away again tomorrow . " <p> Right . His business trip . He 's mentioned it a few times over the weekend . She should probably ask him where he 's going , but that would prolong the conversation and she 's tired . <p> And I do n't really care . <p> Why , oh why , ca n't she make herself care ? Life would be so much easier if she fell in love with Jimmy . He 's the kind of guy she could even bring home to her mother . <p> And that , in a nutshell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love with Jimmy . Nice , Lucinda . <p> Very healthy . <p> Very mature . <p> " Let 's get together for dinner next weekend , " he says . <p> It 's more a suggestion than an outright invitation , so she ca n't exactly say no . You ca n't answer a question nobody 's asked . <p> Whatever . She should probably see him at least once more . Let him down easy . <p> And , hey , you never know . Maybe he 'll start to grow on you . <p> He leans in and kisses her on the lips . <p> Nah . <p> " Thanks for everything , Jimmy . " She reaches around the doorjamb and turns on an interior light . " I had a really nice time . " <p> " So did I. I 'll call you . " <p> Something snaps inside of Lucinda . Before she can stop herself , she hears herself saying , " I do n't think we should see each other anymore . " <p> Jimmy 's dark eyebrows shoot toward his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I 'm so sorry , " she says helplessly . " It just does n't feel right . " <p> She debates adding a clichT line to soften the blow . Like " It 's not you , it 's me " - or maybe something about wanting to stay friends . <p> But that 's not true . She does n't want to stay friends . It would be awkward . And it is him . He 's not her type . She ca n't change that . <p> " I 'm surprised you feel that way , Lucinda . I thought things were going well , and you just said you had a nice time . . . . " <p> I lied . <p> I 'm an idiot . <p> " I 'm sorry , " she says again . " You 're a great guy , and I 'm really glad we met . I just ... ca n't . Do this . " <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>                 @ @ @ @
