Just how does Michael Crichton do it ? His new novel , Prey ( HarperCollins ; 367 pages ) , lacks almost everything a good novel needs . It contains not one single quotable line of dialogue ( " We have to help him ! " " There 's nothing we can do . " That should give you a sense of it ) . It offers not one single well-realized character . It 's riddled with plot holes you could drive a reconstituted brontosaurus through . And yet ... and yet ... it does something few novels can manage : it holds your attention ruthlessly from start to finish . <P> With Prey Crichton goes from dino to nano : the baddie comes from the currently hot field of , the science of building microscopic machines . The hero is an unemployed computer whiz named Jack Forman , a likable blank who has the misfortune to be married to Julia , a workaholic exec at Xymos , a shady Silicon Valley start-up . Xymos builds tiny nanorobots that possess no intelligence of their own but can assemble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems , reproducing and even evolving . Since the thoughtless hubris of scientists is Crichton 's Big Theme , all this must go terribly wrong . A nanoswarm gets loose in the Nevada desert and starts killing people . It falls to Jack to fight it . <P> And somehow it all works . The faceless nanoswarms have an authentically surreal creepiness to them ( they 'll look great in the inevitable movie ) , but the real star of the show is Crichton 's intricate plotting and flawless pacing , which deliver the necessary shocks and surprises at the precise intervals necessary to keep readers riveted until the more or less satisfying denouement . It lacks a human heart , but Prey is a relentlessly efficient machine that grips and does n't let go . Do n't try to resist . There 's nothing you can do .  --  By Lev Grossman
