Ms. Rickert 's last contribution to our pages ( in our December issue ) left several readers wondering just who was the Christmas Witch . Her new tale might also raise a question or two about identity . But is n't that one of the things a memoir ought to do ? <p> HER HUSBAND COMES HOME , stamps the snow from his shoes , kisses her , and asks how her day was . " Our time together is short , " she says . " What are you talking about ? " " I found a deer by the side of the road . It was stuck under the broken fence . Hit by a car . I called the rescue place but when the animal rescue man saw it , he said it had to be shot . The policeman shot it . " He looks through the mail while she stands there , crying . When he realizes this , he hugs her . Already she feels the hard shapes forming at the top of her head . Later , she will tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He will sleep with his mouth pressed against her neck . She will think of the noise the deer made , that horrible braying . At midnight she wakes up . The sky is exploding with distant fireworks . From past experience she knows that if they stand and strain their necks , they can just barely see the veins of color over the treetops . It is mostly futile , and tonight neither of them rises . " Happy New Year , " he whispers . " What do you think animals feel ? " she says . He mumbles something about Wally , their dog , who sleeps soundly at the foot of their bed . " That deer was frightened . Today , I mean . It made the most horrible noise ; did I tell you that ? I never heard such a noise before . It was really mournful and horrible . " The fireworks end in a flourish of tiny explosions . She knows what she should have done . She should not have waited for the policeman , who took four shots before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why did she pretend otherwise ? She should have smothered it and put it out of its misery . NEW YEAR 'S MORNING is cold and crisp . Wally wakes them up with his big wet tongue . Her husband takes him out to do his business . When they come back inside , she listens to the pleasant sounds of her husband talking in soft cooing words to Wally , his food dish being filled . Her husband comes back into the bedroom alone , carefully shutting the door behind him . She knows what that means . He crawls in beside her . He rubs his hands up and down her body . " Happy New Year , " he says . She sinks into his desires until they become her own . Who knows how long they have ? Maybe this is the last time . Later , he fries maple sausage and scrambles eggs , but she finds she can not eat . He asks her if she feels all right . She shrugs . " My head hurts , " she says . " Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctor . She nods . Well , of course . But she does not tell him that she already knows what is happening . She takes down the ornaments , wraps them in tissue paper , circles the tree , removing the lights . The branches brush her cheeks and lips and she nibbles on the bitter green . Her husband is outside , splitting kindling . For a while she stands at the window and watches . Wally lies on his bed in the living room . He does not like the loud noise of the axe . She raises her face to the ceiling . She feels trapped and the feeling rises inside her like bile . She brays . Wally slinks past her , into the kitchen . She brays again . It is both deeply disturbing and a relief . When her husband comes in , carrying kindling , he 'll ask her if she 's all right . He 'll say he thought he heard a strange noise . She 'll shrug and say that she thought the tree was falling . He 'll accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort to scream at falling Christmas trees , forgetting that when they met she was at least partly wild . He drops the kindling into the box next to the wood-burning stove . " Come here , help me with the tree , " she says . He holds the tree while she unscrews the stand . Dry sap snakes from the holes , she can not help but think of it as blood . They dump the tree in the forest behind the house . There is a whole graveyard of Christmas trees there . They walk back to the house together , crunching across the snow . A green truck is parked in the driveway . " I wonder who that is , " he says . A tall man wearing camouflage clothes and a Crocodile Dundee hat steps out of the driver 's side . He nods as they approach . She knows just what her mother would have said about all of this . She would have said , " You are never going to be tame . You will regret trying . You will hurt others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not disturbing you . I 've got an owl that needs to be released . It was found not too far down the road . You know the Paterlys ? They 're in Florida now . I thought I could release it in your yard . You could keep an eye on it . " " This is Kevin , " she tells her husband . " He came to help with the deer yesterday . " Her husband stares at her blankly . " You know , the one I found ? That had to be shot ? " " Ca n't believe that guy could n't shoot between the eyes , " Kevin says , shaking his head . " Oh . Right , " says her husband . " Where 's the owl ? " " I was just passing by . I 'll come back tonight . If that 's all right ? " " Tonight ? " her husband says . She tells Kevin that it would be great if he came back later , with the owl . He does n't look at either of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truck . They watch him back out of the driveway . " He 's kind of strange , " her husband says . She shrugs . Her bones ache , her head , her hands and her feet , and it takes a lot of effort for her to understand that her husband is not being mean , just human . They walk back to the house , holding hands . Who knows , she thinks , maybe this is the last time . Already by nightfall she is wearing mittens . She tells him her hands are cold . Again he tells her to go to the doctor . She tells him that she has an appointment the next morning . This is love , she reminds herself . She smiles at her husband while he turns the pages of his book . " Stage three , " the doctor says . " There must be some mistake . " " You can get a second opinion . " " What are my options ? " " I say we hit this with everything we 've got . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I know this comes as a shock , but I recommend that you address it quickly . The sooner the better . " " Chemo and radiation ? " " Yes . And then chemo again . " " The magic bullets . " " You could think of it that way , but you might want to choose a different image . Something soothing . " " Like what ? " " I have one patient who thinks of the treatment as flowers . " " Flowers ? " " It soothes her . " " What kind of flowers ? Flowers that 'll cause my hair to fall out and make me throw up ? What kind of flowers would do that ? " " This is your disease , and your body . You get to decide how you want to treat it . " " But that 's just the thing , is n't it , Doctor ? " " I 'm sorry ? " " This is n't my body anymore . " " Why do n't you go home ? Take the weekend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 'd like . " She rises from the chair , stomps out of the office on her sore , hard feet . The waiting room is full of women . One of them looks up , her brown eyes beautiful in the soft pelt of her face . She nods slightly . She smells like salt . When her husband returns from work she is sitting at the kitchen table , waiting to tell him the news . " Oh my God , " he says . " It hardly hurts at all . " " How long ? " he asks . " Nobody knows , but it seems to be happening sooner rather than later . " He pounds the table with his fist , then reaches for her hand , though he recoils from the shape . " But you 're a woman . " She is confused until she sees where he is looking . She touches the antlers " downy stubs on the top of her head . " It 's rare , but females get them too . Nobody knows why . Kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What are you going to do ? " he asks . " I 'm thinking of writing a memoir . " His mouth drops open . She shrugs . " I always did want to be a writer . " " What are you talking about ? " " I think I should start with the deer being shot , what do you think ? " " I think you need medicine , not writing . " " You make it sound dirty . " He shakes his head . He is crying and shaking his head and all of a sudden she realizes that he will never understand . Should she say so in her memoir ? Should she write about all the places he never understood ? Will he understand that she does n't blame him ? " It is n't lonely , " she says . " What ? " She had n't meant to speak out loud . " I mean , okay , sometimes it is . " " I do n't know what you 're talking about . " " There 's a memoir-writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leader ? I explained my situation and she was really nice about it . She said I could join them . " " I do n't see how this is going to help . You need medicine and doctors . We need to be proactive here . " " Could you just be supportive ? I really need your support right now . " He looks at her with teary blue eyes that once , she thought , she would look at forever . He says , his voice husky , " Of course . " She is sniffling , and he wipes her nose for her . She licks his hand . She continues to sleep with him , but in the morning he wakes up with deep scratch marks all over his body , no matter how thickly they wrap her hooves in layers of cloth and old socks and mittens . " They 're like little razors , " he says . " And it 's not just the edges , it 's the entire bottom . " She blinks her large brown eyes at him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tick out of his elbow . That night she sleeps on the floor and Wally crawls into bed with her husband . He objects , of course , but in the end , they both sleep better , she , facing the window where she watches the white owl , hugely fat and round , perched on the bough of a tree , before she realizes it is n't the owl at all but the moon . NEAR THE END she stops trying to drive ; instead she runs to her memoir-writing workshop . Her husband follows in the Volvo , thinking that he can prevent her being hit by a car , or shot . He waits in the driveway while she meets with the group . Anita tries to make her comfortable , but lately she feels nervous coming all the way into the house . She lies in the doorway with only her nose and front hooves inside . Some of the others complain about the cold and the snow but Anita tells them to put on their coats . Sometimes , in the distance , they hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There have been rumors of coyotes in the neighborhood . Even though they meet at Anita 's house , she herself is having a terrible time with her memoir . It sounds self-pitying , whiny , and dull . She knows this ; she just does n't know what to do about it , that 's why she started the workshop in the first place . The critiquers mean well , but frankly , they are all self-pitying whiners themselves . Somewhere along the way , the meetings have taken on the tone of group therapy rather than a writing workshop . Yet , there is something , some emotion they all seem to circle but never successfully describe about the pain of their lives that , Anita feels certain , just might be the point . After the critique , Anita brings out cakes , cookies , coffee , tea , and , incredibly , a salt lick . Contrary to their reputation , and the evidence of the stories told in this room , people can be good . The deer woman has n't shared what she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand . How can anyone understand what is happening to her ? And besides , it is all happening so fast . No one even realizes when she attends her last meeting that she wo n't be coming back , though later , they all agree that she seemed different somehow . She is standing at the window , watching the yard below . Six deer wait there , staring up at her . He weeps and begs her not to go . Why does he do this , she wonders , why does he spend their last moments together weeping ? He begs her not to go , as though she had some say in the matter . She does not answer . The world shatters all around her , but she is not cut . He shouts . She crashes to the ground , in a flurry of snow and hooves . He stands at the window , his mouth wide open . He does not mean to hurt her , but she can feel his breath pulling her back . She runs into the forest with the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They do not stop running until they are deep into the night , and she can no longer hear her husband shouting . AFTER SHE IS GONE , he looks through her basket of knitting , projects started and unfinished from the winter , before her hands turned into hooves : a long thin strand of purple , which he assumes is a scarf ; a deep green square , which he thinks might be the beginning of a sweater for him ; and a soft gray wasp nest , that 's what it looks like , knit from the strands of her hair . Underneath all this he finds a simple , spiral-bound notebook . He sits on the floor and reads what she wrote , until the words sputter and waver and finally end , then he walks up the stairs to the attic , where he thrusts aside boxes of books , and dolls , cups , and papers , before finally opening the box labeled " writing supplies . " There he finds the cape , neatly folded beneath deerskin boots , a few blades of brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , but the boots are too tight . He takes them downstairs and splits the seams with the paring knife , laces them on with rope . When he is finished , he makes a strange sight , his chest hair gray against the winter white skin , the cape draped over his narrow shoulders and down the skein of his arms to his blue jeans , which are tied at the calves , laced over the deerskin , his feet bulging out of the sides , like a child suddenly grown to giant proportions . He runs into the forest , calling her name . Wally , the dog , runs beside him . THERE ARE SIGHTINGS . An old lady , putting seed into the bird feeder , sees him one morning , a glint of white cape , tight muscles , a wild look in his eyes . Two children , standing right beside their father waiting for the bus , scream and point . An entire group of hunters , who say they tracked him and might have gotten a shot . And an artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporting strange sightings and ca n't be relied upon . What is certain is that wherever the strange man is sighted , words are found . The old lady finds several tiny slips of paper in a bird nest in her backyard and when one falls to the ground she sees that it is a neat cut-out of the word , " Always , " she ca n't fathom what it might mean , but considers it for the rest of her life , until one afternoon in early autumn she lies dying on her kitchen floor , no trauma beyond the business of a stopped heart , and she sees the word before her face , as though it floated there , a missive from heaven , and she is filled with an understanding of the infinite , and how strange , that this simple word becomes , in that final moment , luminescent ; when the father searches the bushes where the children insist the wild man hides , he finds nothing but scraps of paper , tiny pieces , which he almost dismisses , until he realizes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children too long with madmen about , he scoops some words up and returns to the bus stop , listening to the children 's excited chatter but not really hearing anything they say , because the words drag his pocket down like stones , and he ca n't believe how eager he is to go to work , shut the door to his office and piece together the meaning . He is disappointed at what he finds , " breath , " " fingers , " and " memory , " amongst several versions of " her . " It is nonsense , but he can not forget the words , and at the strangest times catches himself thinking , " Her breath , her fingers , her memory " as though he were a man in love , - the hunters follow the trail of words , but only the youngest among them picks up and pockets one torn paper , which is immediately forgotten , thrown in the wash and destroyed ; the artist finds a neat little pile , as though the wild creature ate words like sunflower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word to colored string and hangs them as a mobile . Sometimes , when the air is just right and the words spin gently , she believes she understands them , that they are not simple nonsense ; but on other days she knows that meaning is something humans apply to random acts in order to cope with the randomness of death . Anita , from the memoir-writing group , goes to the house , uninvited . She does n't know what motivates her . The woman wrote nothing the whole time she 'd attended , had offered no suggestions during the critique ; in fact , Anita began to suspect that her main motivation for coming had been the salt lick . But for some reason , Anita felt invested in the woman 's unknown story , and feels she must find out what has become of her . What she finds is a small house in the woods , by all appearances empty . She rings the doorbell and is surprised to hear a dog inside , barking . She notices deer tracks come right up to the porch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strange man stands there , dressed in torn boots , dirty jeans , and a cape . Anita has heard rumors of the wild man and does n't know what to say , she manages only two words , " Memoir " and " writing , " before he grabs her wrist . " Gone , " he says , " gone . " They stand there for a while , looking at each other . She is a bit frightened , of course , but she also feels pity for this man , obviously mad with grief . " Words ? " he says . She stares at him , and he repeats himself , ( " Words , words , words , words , words , words ? " ) until finally she understands what he 's asking . " She never wrote a thing . " He shakes his head and runs back into the house . Anita stands there for a moment , and then , just as she turns to walk away from this tragic scene , the man returns , carrying a handful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ashes of the deceased , gently folding her fingers over them , as though in prayer , before he goes back inside . She shakes her head as she walks away , opening the car door with difficulty , her hands fisted as they are . Once in her car , she drops the words into her purse , where they remain until a windy day in early Fall , when she searches for her keys in the mall parking lot . A quick breeze picks the tiny scraps up and they twirl in the sky , all the possible , all the forgotten , all the mysterious , unwritten , and misunderstood fragments , and it is only then , when they are hopelessly gone , that Anita regrets having done nothing with them . From this regret , her memoir is written , about the terrible thing that happened to her . She is finally able to write that there is no sorrow greater than regret , no rapture more complete than despair , no beauty more divine than words , but before writing it , she understands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , watching all the words spin away , as though she had already died , and no longer owned language , that ordinary , every day , exquisite blessing on which lives are both built , and destroyed .
