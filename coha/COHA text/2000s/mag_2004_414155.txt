Campbell Hill 1,550 feet The Peak The biggest challenge in reaching the top of this not-so-airy spot on the campus of the Ohio Hi-Point Career Center is arriving when the fenced facility is open ( it 's shuttered Sundays and holidays ) . Once inside the former Air Force station , park near the flagpole and walk 50 yards up a hill to a brick concourse and a stone marked with an X. The view of the Cosmetology School is divine . The Pride According to the Highpointers Club , only three peaks are easier to scale . Nevertheless , Bellefontaine , home of America 's first concrete street , is gripped by summit fever : Just outside the Hi-Point Career Center is the Hi-Point Church of Christ , a short drive from the overpriced Mountain Top Inn . Downtown , scores of yellow flags inscribed with " Peak of Ohio " line Main Street . On South Main , the grand " Highpoint Village " sign-which depicts a snow-capped mountain bathed in brilliant red light-towers over a sprawling shopping center . 44* INDIANA Hoosier Hill 1,257 feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foggy , you may have lost a contact lens ; it would still be hard to miss the Hill , the pride of plywood-flat Wayne County . Park by the lone wooded area on broom-handle-straight Elliott Road , walk west for 50 yards , and turn right at the pile of car tires . You 'll be facing a grove of trees surrounded by barbwire . The crux of the climb is five steel steps that take you up , over , and down the fence to a clearing where two benches chained to trees provide an excellent view of the high point sign and a pile of rocks . It 's a fitting place to ponder the true meaning of the term Hoosier . A half-dozen theories exist , but we like Dave Barry 's best : " For all we know , " he writes , ' " Hoosier ' could be a Native American word for ' has sex with caribou . ' " The Path Did you know that Cyrus Pemberton of Fairmount , IN , invented the ice cream cone in 1904 from dough molded on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-invented Alka-Seltzer ? You will by the time you emerge from McMaze , an 11-acre corn labyrinth sprouting signs bearing Hoosier trivia at the Dougherty Orchards in Cambridge City . In years past , the Doughertys have cut trails that form aerial images of hoops star Larry Bird , Colts QB Peyton Manning , and an ear of corn . In 2003 , they sculpted a toothy 675-foot likeness of native son David Letterman ( see them all at **25;4119;TOOLONG ) . The maze is open from July to December . 45 ILLINOIS Charles Mound 1,235 feet The Peak Chicago transplants Wayne and Jean Wuebbels are just the third owners of the Holstein-trampled hump where Elijah Charles built his log home in 1827 . From the gate at the end of their gravel driveway on Charles Mound Road , the 1.1-mile one-way stroll gains 75 vertical feet . Along the way , you pass within peeping distance of the Wuebbels 's abode , which explains why this high point is open only the first full weekends of June , July , August , and September . The Picture They built it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're talking about the baseball diamond where " Shoeless " Joe Jackson materialized from the corn in Field of Dreams , which is 50 miles west of Charles Mound in Dyersville , IA . Since the film 's release in 1989 , roughly 55,000 regular Joes , with and without cleats , have circled the bases behind the century-old Lansing family farm . If you forget your bat , ball , or even your coffee mug , you can buy one there ( or visit **30;4146;TOOLONG ) . The field is open April through November ; admission is free . 37 MINNESOTA Eagle Mountain 2,301 feet The Peak Eagle Mountain , the northernmost high point in the Lower 48 , may be just 2,301 feet high , but it 's no anonymous cornfield . It resides in Superior National Forest , the largest outside of Alaska , amid one of the world 's great paddling destinations , the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness . The park boasts 1,000 lakes ( leaving just 9,000 for the rest of the state ) as well as the pristine 3.5-mile one-way trail to Minnesota 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rocky terrain to Whale Lake , where it 's all but impossible not to picnic . Then you begin to climb , gaining 600 feet over the last mile . There are timber wolves , moose , bear , and , of course , eagles . The Pop If you 're stoked to stroke , launch your boat from Ely , an old mining town that Charles Kuralt once called the number one vacation destination in America . En route , stop by the museum devoted to the Root Beer Lady , aka Dorothy Molten The last year-round resident of the BWCAW , Molter spent 56 years in a remote cabin by the Canadian border where she annually brewed 12,000 bottles of root beer for the hordes of parched paddlers who stopped at her resort . After her death in 1986 , a band of North Woods soda devotees spent 7 years moving her two cluttered cabins by canoe , snowmobile , and dog sled to the rise on MN 1 where they stand today . Dorothy 's recipe is on sale for $2 ; the suds on tap are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mt . Arvon 1,979 feet The Peak In the 1950s , Porcupine Mountain was considered the tallest in the state . Mt . Curwood reigned in the 1970s . Then in 1982 , a USGS survey proclaimed Mt . Arvon a whopping 11 inches higher . This was a dark day for high pointers : For years afterward , the ever-changing , unmarked , often-impassable logging roads to the trailhead made getting there a navigational nightmare with little payoff ; the sleepy spot lacks a view . But now diamond-shaped blue-and-white signs guide you to the gradual 1-mile hike up a rutted trail to the highest point in Michigan . At least until the next high point is discovered . The Priest Fifteen miles from Mt . Arvon in the town of Baraga stands a 35-foot copper statue of Frederic Baraga , the first Bishop of the Upper Peninsula . Standing on a cloud of stainless steel above Lake Superior 's Keweenaw Bay , the heavy-metal priest clutches a 7-foot cross in one hand and 26-foot-long snowshoes in the other . Born in Slovenia , Baraga arrived in Michigan in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missions . During his two decades up north , the Snowshoe Priest traveled thousands of miles by canoe , snowshoe , and even ice floe , spreading the Gospel and putting the Ottawa and Ojibwa tongue into text . During one frigid sojourn from L'Anse to Duluth , his eyes froze shut . Clearly , the man was hardcore-and maybe even a saint , if you believe the locals who 've petitioned the Vatican 14 times on his behalf .

Timms Hill County Park , an old logging camp just off Rustic Road , is a peaceful place with a parking lot , pavilion , and playground . Climb 88 steps up the observation tower and savor a view ( stellar during fall colors ) that features six lakes set between rolling hills last logged in 1944 . The Pisces For the mother of all muskies , head 100 miles southwest to the National Fresh Water Fishing Hall of Fame &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaping Esox masquinongy . Nearly five stories high and 143 feet long , the pugnacious pike has an observation deck that can hold 20 in its toothy maw . Inside the museum , you 'll find the tackle box panorama , the Hall of Outboard Motors , and the Examples of Poor Taxidermy display . The museum is open April through November ( 715-634-4440 ) . 28 KANSAS Mt . Sunflower 4,039 feet The Peak A plaque at the high point monument on the Harold family farm in western Kansas reads : " On This Site in 1897 Nothing Happened . " Even so , it 's a happening spot : There 's a 6-foot sunflower fashioned from railroad spikes , a mailbox riddled with bullet holes , and a cow 's skull perched so high on a sun-bleached tree trunk it seems suspended in the clouds . The Predator If you 've long wondered about the taste of rattlesnake but have never gotten close enough to bite one before it bit you , head to the annual Rattlesnake Roundup in tiny Sharon Springs , 20 miles from Mt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2-day festival features chicken-fried snake , snake on a stick , and snake tidbits ( yup , they taste like McNuggets ) . There 's also a snake hunt with a $100 grand prize for the biggest serpent . The recordsetting catch was a 53-inch prairie rattler named Scruffy . " They 're smaller , meaner , and feistier than diamondbacks , " says chairwoman Judy Withers . No one has been bitten during the contest , but snakes cause three-quarters of all dog deaths in the county .

There 's a paved path from the parking lot to the polished granite summit marker , which is shaded by a sturdy oak . It 's a bit tamer than in 1874 , when Jesse James hid here after robbing the Ironton Train . Head a mile down the trail to Mina Sauk Falls and it 's still easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Longacre , a Michigan native living in Seattle , placed a notice in a magazine saying he 'd like to hear from high pointers . Two dozen replied and a club was born . Now the Highpointers Club has a quarterly newsletter , an annual convention , and 2,677 members in 50 states and eight countries . The seventh person to climb all 50 high points , Longacre lived alone in a double-wide trailer 2.5 miles from Taum Sauk Mountain and was 11 high points short of climbing them again when he died of cancer in 2002 at the age of 64 . " Jack 's Ash Scattering Project , " honoring his final wish to have his ashes sprinkled on all 50 high points , will be complete after a dusting this summer on Gannett Peak , WY . For information , see www.highpointers.org. 42 IOWA Hawkeye Point 1,670 feet The Peak Fifty years ago , when Donna and Merrill Sterler built their house near Sibley , Iowa 's high point was the distinctive Ocheyedan Mound , once used as a lookout by Native Americans and later as a landmark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a USGS survey confirmed that the gentle rise at the end of the Sterlers ' feed trough was 57 feet higher . The view is high on soy and corn and low on drama . But as Ian Frazier waxed in Great Plains , " The beauty of the plains is not just in themselves but in the sky , in what you think when you look at them , and in what they are not . " The Product The Sterlers offer complimentary Iowa-shaped keychains to the hundreds of visitors who arrive each year , but they also sell baseball caps with the Hawkeye Hill logo for $7 each . How much dough do the prairie entrepreneurs rake in ? Donna Sterler , a grandmother of six who was born in Sibley in 1933 , says : " Gosh ... we probably sold nearly two dozen one year . " Then she pauses and giggles . " Actually , we gave most of them away .

The spectacular serpentine drive through Custer State Park to the trailhead at Sylvan Lake leaves you gasping for superlatives . The 3-mile trail twists through thick stands of ponderosa pine , gains 1,100 feet , and tops off at a surreal fortresslike structure , the highest point east of the Rockies . The Prophet Black Elk , the Oglala medicine man who fought at the Battle of the Little Big Horn , called this spot the " center of the universe . " In fact , Harney Peak is not far from the precise geographical center of the United States . His description of a vision he had on the summit , from the book Black Elk Speaks : " Then I was standing on the highest mountain of them all , and round about beneath me was the whole hoop of the world . And while I stood there I saw more than I can tell and I understood more than I saw ....

It lies 7 miles and a maze of desolate gravel roads southeast of Amidon ( a town of 40 with a standout burger joint ) in Slope County , an area larger than Rhode Island with just 767 people . The mile-long hike leads past four barbwire fences and through a harsh landscape French traders called tes mauvaises terres a traverser-bad lands to travel through . The peak is appropriately named : It 's all white rock , white mud , even white grasshoppers .
