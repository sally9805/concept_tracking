What would you do to reinvigorate the sitcom ? I 'd get rid of the laugh track , ' cause the writers do n't write as funny , the actors do n't act as funny . <P> Do you hear much from the generation that discovered you in syndication ? I started getting a whole lot more fan mail in crayon when we went on Nick at Nite . <P> Ellen DeGeneres calls you an influence . Do you see it ? I influenced Ellen , but Ellen then developed her own sound . People would say to me , " Do you stammer , or did you develop it ? " That was just the way I talked . I did n't say , " There 's no stammerer out there in comedy . There 's an opening ! " <P> You played a psychologist so memorably . Did people ever assume you could dispense advice ? I did get a letter from a woman who said her son was having problems . They went to the boy and said , " We think we should go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he be like that man on television ? " So that 's when I felt we were having a positive impact . <P> You 're on Desperate Housewives . What do you make of the show 's success ? Some people are watching it because they think it 's a soap . That 's why I 'm attracted to it  --  it 's a send-up of a genre of television . <P> PBS is preparing an American Masters program about you . Why still do stand-up when it 's official  --  you 're a master ? The alternative is Sunset Blvd . You sit in a darkened room every day , and Erich von Stroheim comes in and asks you what episode of The Bob Newhart Show you want to watch . I 'd rather keep making people laugh .
