<p> Outside Fairhaven School , half a dozen teenagers are whacking one another over the heads with plastic swords . An interactive antiterrorism computer game is raging in the video room , card games are being played in the lounge . And , in the silent room , two tired young bodies slump on couches , breathing softly as they sleep away the afternoon . <p> The three R 's are of no interest to anyone here . Fairhaven , modeled after a system called the Sudbury Valley School , is a school , yes . But not as you might know it . <p> It is everything the ubiquitous " Leave No Child Behind " model of school , with its standardized testing and formulaic demands , is not . <p> This is a school with no set hours , no required classes , no grades , no parent-teacher meetings , and no rules except for the ones the people here make up and vote on themselves . It 's a school where youngsters have a say on everything - from whether sipping soda should be allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired at the end of the year . <p> Students ages 5 to 19 mix freely here with each other and with the teachers ( known as " doers " ) , and are encouraged to take their time figuring out what they want to learn - and then how , when , where , and from whom to learn it . Meanwhile , in their " spare time , " they play . Or get bored . Both , according to the school 's mission , are welcome activities . <p> Fairhaven is a so-called " free school . " The philosophy behind the model is that humans are curious by nature - and so the most efficient and profound learning will take place when started and pursued by the learner . Freedom and democracy , continues the philosophy , will help develop personal responsibility and maturity . <p> But playing hairdresser all morning ? Fishing for the whole day ? Sculpting Play-Doh for a whole year ? Skeptics raise their eyebrows and call the parents who send their children there irresponsible , arguing that adult guidance is needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Yet , the popularity of the Sudbury model , like that of other alternative schools such as Montessori , Waldorf , and Progressive ( all different from free schools but equally far removed from the content-oriented , test-driven approach shaping much of public school education today ) , seems to be growing . <p> The original Sudbury school opened in Framingham , Mass. , in 1968 , but to the surprise of its founders , the model failed to spawn others until almost 20 years later . <p> " It 's such a wonderful model , we thought people would flock to it , " says Lisa Lyons , who helped found a Sudbury school in Maine , before moving to Fairhaven . " Only now is it getting the deserved attention . " <p> Today , there are more than 300 free schools throughout the world . One of the first - and perhaps still best known - is Summerhill in Leiston , England , launched in 1921 . <p> There are also 31 schools based on the Sudbury model , including some in places as far-flung as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington , Baltimore , and Annapolis - is among the largest of the lot : With 73 students , it has grown almost threefold since it opened . Of the 10 students who finished Fairhaven ( either by writing a ' personal senior statement/thesis ' and graduating or simply by ending their time there at age 18 ) since it was started seven years ago , half have gone on to college , one is in midwifery school , and the others are working . One favorite son is a professional skateboarder . <p> The model 's advocates see the increasing popularity of the schools , at least in part , as a reaction to the increased standardization of the education system in the US . " No Child Left Behind is a disaster , " says Ms. Lyons . " Teachers are making time just to teach to the tests . Couple that with constant budget crises , and you get things like arts , music , and recess eliminated . " <p> There are plenty of parents , argues Lyons , who are " eager for their children to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a less regimented , formulaic environment . The more regimented the public school system is , the more inquiries we get . " <p> Ted Sizer , a professor at Harvard 's School of Education and the former headmaster of Phillips Academy in Andover , Mass. , says the spike in interest in Sudbury is part of a larger trend . " Parents have been looking for alternatives for their children for years , " he says . This is due to a desire not so much for a particular method of education but for more personal attention . <p> " Most Americans are more or less confident in the basic shape of the American public school , " he says . " But what they are running away from - and have for years - is a school system which leaves their kids anonymous , where the kids are just shuffled around and not cared for . " <p> The number of graduates is still too few to fully evaluate the success of this particular alternative , he says - but so far he believes Sudbury " is providing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Katie Fitzdale is one of those kids who felt uncared for in public school . The daughter of a public school teacher , she never felt right there . She learned almost perfect French , yes , but she generally made bad grades , had few friends , and was altogether unhappy . At age 15 she switched to Fairhaven and thrived , graduating and going on to the Art Institute of Chicago , where she is today a junior studying photography . <p> " Some people think Fairhaven is easy , " she says . " But , in fact , you are responsible for your whole day and that can be hard to come to terms with . In my case , it pushed me to be curious and to work hard . " The model is not perfect , she adds , " ... but it 's the best that 's out there . " <p> That the model works for some children is not surprising , argues Prof. Mike Timpane , former president of Colombia University 's Teachers College , but that does n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-selected group , a lot of approaches will work ... somewhat , " he argues , adding that most students at schools " on the fringe " are , almost by definition , open to engaging in something different . There are no grounds to shut these schools down , maintains Mr. Timpane , but he concludes , there is no reason to think " it could work for large numbers of kids . " <p> Many Fairhaven parents would be the first to admit the school is not for everyone , and that enrolling a child in Fairhaven ( which charges annual tuition of $ 6,300 ) can demand a huge leap of faith . " You will have doubts along the way , and say to yourself - why did we do this ? " says Susan Stephen , whose son Thor is graduating this year . " But the whole process of raising children is a leap of faith . " <p> Mrs. Stephen and her husband - both products of public schools in the Midwest - used to be " great believers in public school , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullying and low-level teaching - sent them scurrying to the Internet to research options . " We are no hippies or anything like that . But we realized that children are different and it 's impossible to try to form them into a block . We wanted to give our kids an alternative way of growing up . " <p> For Thor it worked . After not taking a math class in six years ( " Yes , we were worried , " laughs Stephen ) he decided to study for the SAT - and scored 1400 , well above average . And after long school years filled with perfecting his video-game maneuvers , he has a good idea of what he wants to study - video-game design , of course . <p> " I will stay at Fairhaven a year more before I apply , " says the 18-year-old . " There is more I want to get out of this place before leaving . " <p> Thor 's younger sister , Anika , however , opted out of Fairhaven after only a year . <p> " It was hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because we are committed to the model , " says Stephen , who now home-schools her daughter . " But she wanted more structure . She felt this was not appropriate for her , and knew what she needed . " <p> Kids , concludes Stephen , often do . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 .
