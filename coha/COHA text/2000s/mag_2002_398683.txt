The Recollections of Sergeant John W. Plummer , Company D , 1st Minnesota Photograph Photograph Cadmus Wilcox William Colvill , Jr . // SOLDIERS OF THE BLOODIED , UNDERSTRENGTH 1st Minnesota Infantry Regiment on Cemetery Ridge had a panoramic view of the battlefield at Gettysburg , Pennsylvania , on the afternoon of July 2 , 1863 . The 262 officers and men did not like what they saw : Confederate attackers were relentlessly pushing back Maj. Gen. Daniel Sickles ' III Corps . Only the Ist Minnesota stood between the Rebels and the Union rear . Major General Winfield Scott Hancock , commanding II Corps on Sickles ' right , could also foresee an imminent Confederate breakthrough . Riding up to the regiment 's position , Hancock asked Colonel William Colvill , Jr. , who was trying to rally III Corps stragglers , " What regiment is this ? " Colvill replied , " First Minnesota . " Pointing at the oncoming Confederates , Hancock ordered : " Charge those lines ! " Colvill strode before the regiment , relayed Hancock 's order and asked the men if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Every man realized in an instant what that order meant-death or wounds to us all ; the sacrifice of the regiment to gain a few minutes time and save the position , and probably the battlefield-and every man saw and accepted the necessity for the sacrifice . " Hancock could scarcely have found a regiment better suited for this desperate job . The tough northwesterners had already served with distinction at the First Battle of Bull Run , Ball 's Bluff , Yorktown , Seven Pines , Malvern Hill , Antietam , Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville , earning special fame for refusing to retreat at Antietam until they were nearly overwhelmed . The men moved down the western slope of Cemetery Ridge toward Brig . Gen. Cadmus Wilcox 's Alabama brigade . Fixing bayonets , they passed through a swale as bullets , cannonballs and grapeshot swept its formation . " Comrade after comrade dropped from the ranks , " Sergeant Alfred Carpenter recalled , " but on the line went . No one took a second look at his fallen comrade . We had no time to weep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in check . Colvill fell , badly wounded , and command quickly passed through five successive officers , all of whom were also struck down . Remarkably , 262 Federals had stopped an entire enemy brigade . Indeed , the attack was so ferocious that Wilcox was convinced that he had faced a much larger force . He later said , " my men were withdrawn , to prevent their entire destruction or capture . " The regiment suffered for its gallantry . Two-thirds of the men were killed or wounded-a staggering toll . But the quarter-hour the Minnesotans bought with their blood gave Hancock time to rally II Corps and seal the Union breach . After the battle , Hancock said he 'd had no alternative but to order the regiment in when he did : " I knew they must lose heavily and it caused me pain to give the order to advance , but I would have done it if I had known every man would be killed . It was a sacrifice that had to be made . The superb gallantry of those men saved our line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorded in history . " Despite their heavy losses in the Peach Orchard , the men of the 1st Minnesota regiment remained on the front line the next day , less than 100 yards south of a copse of trees on Cemetery Ridge . At 1 o'clock on the afternoon of the 3rd , Confederate artillery opened fire on the position , heralding the onset of Pickett 's Charge , General Robert E. Lee 's illstarred attempt to break the Union center . In this clash , the 1st Minnesota lost another 50 casualties , raising regimental losses to 229 . One of the few members of the regiment who came through Gettysburg unscathed was Company D Sergeant John W. Plummer , a 21-year-old plasterer . Plummer attempted to describe the battle to his brother back home in Minnesota . Though Plummer modestly thought his sketch " imperfect , " he captured the utter confusion of combat , as well as the fear , anger and courage that propelled the 1st Minnesota down the western slope of Cemetery Ridge . Plummer 's home  --  spun account follows . prospect of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread them out on our knapsacks , so that in traveling along they were drying and continually lessening our load . About three miles from Taneytown , we began to hear the first rumors and reports we had heard of a battle then progressing at Gettysburg , and also plainly see the two lines of smoke of the two contending parties ' fire .... Rumors came thicker as we neared the field , from citizens , cavalrymen and orderlies ; but , as usual on such occasions , so contradictory we could make nothing definite or reliable out of them , though the weight of them seemed to satisfy us that at the close of the battle our forces were worsted , and had to fall back some distance , though we did not get near enough to the field that night to see many wounded men or skedaddlers .... We halted about three miles from Gettysburg about nine o'clock that night , and had orders to build breast  --  works ... but as we were pretty tired and could n't really see the necessity of work that far from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid down to sleep , which , as it afterwards proved , was just as well , as no fighting was done there . The country after we crossed the Pennsylvania line seemed very much like some of the poorer parts of Virginia , and the people like the Virginians .. perfectly indifferent to our army passing through , and the great conflict which was raging .. so near their homes , and on the result of which depended the fate of the whole country . One group in particular , we saw , were , we believed , truly loyal , as one of them , a very intelligent looking woman , said to us while passing , with much feeling , " It gives us so much pleasure to see our good Union soldiers coming . " Many a fervent " God bless you ! " and " Good for you ! " were uttered by the tired and weary soldiers , and many , too , forgot their weariness and their loads , feeling that for such they could fight and endure any hardship without grumbling . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead , ( Russ Allen ) said , " Boys , who would n't fight for such as these ? " Just that little expression ... seemed to put new life into all of us , and we resolved , if possible , to give them yet more pleasure by driving the invaders from their soil . The next morning July 2 we were called up about daylight , and before we had time to get coffee , had to march for the battlefield .... Troops were moving around in every direction , getting in position of the coming battle . Our corps was marched to the center , but before being placed in position .. we heard an appeal to the troops by Brig . Gen. John Gibbon , our division commander , who asked all to do their duty and win the gratitude and esteem of our friends and of the nation , and ordered that every one found skulking away in time of action should suffer death . I have always thought it would do good to make these addresses to troops before going into action , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Napoleon used to and the Southerners do ; but it is practiced but little in our army . One thing our armies lack is enthusiasm , and no efforts are made to create it , when , in many cases , it would accomplish more than real bravery or bulldog courage ; so I think at least . Well , our corps and batteries got into position about nine o'clock , and occasionally a shot was fired from our guns , and some sharp skirmishing was carried on in front of our lines . Our brigade Brig . Gen. William Harrow 's was not in front , so we went to making coffee and cooking , and filling up the inner man , preparatory to the coming struggle . About two o'clock the rebels opened on us from some of their batteries , and the way the ambulances , hospital men , stragglers and darkies did skedaddle for the rear , was amusing to those old fellows who had got used , somewhat , to such things as shells . Several men of the brigade were wounded , and one shell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounded three others . After laying there about two hours , or till four o'clock , we were ordered to get our things on and be ready to move , as the Third Corps on our left was going in .... The artillery and musketry then commenced firing on the left and continued with but little change for two hours , when our men began to give away slowly . We were at once ordered up to the left to support our batteries , and check the rebs ' advance . We were marched up there about a quarter of a mile , and ordered to lie down in front of the batteries very plainly . AS I SAW OUR MEN fall back , rally , and fall back again , skedaddlers rushing to the rear in squads , I never felt so bad in my life . I thought sure the day was gone for us , and felt that I would prefer to die there , rather than live and suffer the disgrace and humiliation ... and if ever I offered a sincere prayer in my life , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We all felt bad , but resolved when our chance came to do our best to retrieve the fortunes of the day , hardly expecting to come out of the conflict unharmed . Our turn soon came . We were ordered forward against the enemy , who were then within musket range of us , and if any ever were willing and anxious to go forward into what we all could see was a deadly place , our boys were . We had two open fields to advance over , while the rebs were coming down over another open field , and the Third Corps falling back before them . We went forward on a run , and a yell , till about half way across the second field , when we were ordered , for some unaccountable reason to us , to halt , and the bullets were coming like hailstones , and whittling our boys like grain before the sickle . " Why do n't they let us charge ? " cried all of us . " Why do they stop us here to be murdered ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way out ahead and beckoned for us to come on . We have always believed that a determined charge would break any line , and that more would be accomplished ... than by lying down and firing two or three hours . ... We wanted to go against them with a vengeance and get over the deadly ground as soon as possible . We were halted again when across the second field , and though by this time few were left , we were just as anxious to go forward . We were almost together and the rebs had nearly flanked the right of the regiment . But what surprised me most was to see some of the rebs , not fifty yards from us , standing out openly and loading and firing as deliberately as though they were in no danger whatever . Ah ! There is no mistake but what some of those rebs are just as brave as it is possible for human beings to be . We had not fired but few shots before we were ordered to fall back . " T was sometime before we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right of the regiment was half way back . We dreaded to go back for the danger of it , more than staying there , and we felt though only obeying orders , that we were being disgraced to fall back when we knew we could hold our own . We fell back , and it was then I had the first feeling of fear during the fight . I felt almost sure I would be hit , and I saw many wounded going back . When we got back to the colors , where we rallied , scarce 25 men were to be found . Most who went in were killed , wounded , or helping off the wounded . The enemy advanced no farther , and soon some of our boys who did not fall back when ordered , came in bringing in prisoners , and they said when we fell back the rebs were making for the rear as fast as possible . It was now about dark . Another line ... of the First Corps .. went in where we came out , found no enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get off our wounded .... As we were going to the right to join the brigade , musketry was heard very plain , seemingly scarce half a mile off , and completely in our rear ; in fact , some of the bullets whistled over our heads . Now we were sure that the battle was gone up for us , for the fighting continued fierce , and seemed growing nearer all the time . We made up our minds that we were whipped , and expected before morning to see the whole army routed , and flying for Baltimore . The prospect was gloomy and discouraging in the extreme , to us , but thank God , that time we were deceived . The firing soon ceased on the right and what seemed our rear ; the troops were got in their places , and put in position for the contest , whenever it should open again . Our brigade was placed almost in the same position we had previous to the charge in the afternoon , viz : the left center of the army , and the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get some sleep , with our equipment on and guns by our sides , and I here say I never slept better and had more pleasant dreams in my life than I had on the battlefield of Gettysburg , with dead men and horses lying all around me .... WE GOT UP ABOUT DAYLIGHT July 3 ; expected and awaited an attack from the enemy at any moment , but till afternoon all was quiet , except occasionally a shot from their or our batteries . Most of us got some coffee during the forenoon .... A man 's appetite generally , during a battle , is not very voracious . About half past twelve o'clock , as we had gathered around one of our lieutenants to hear the yesterday 's Baltimore Clipper read , bang ! comes one of their shells over us , striking about twenty yards from us . That stopped the reading ; each man took his place , laid down , and for the next two hours hugged the ground just about as close as human beings are generally in the habit of doing . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open , at less than half a mile distance .... Such an artillery fire has never been witnessed in this war . The air seemed to be filled with the hissing , screaming , bursting missiles , and all of them really seemed to be directed at us . They knew our exact position , for before we lay down they could with the naked eye plainly see us , and where our lines were , and tried to explode their shells directly over us , but , fortunately , most of them just went far enough to clear us , while many struck in front of us and bounded over us . We lay behind a slight rise of ground , just enough , by laying close , to hide us from the view of the rebs . A good many shell and pieces struck mighty close to us , and among us , but strange to say , none of us were injured , while the troops that lay behind us had many killed and wounded . Our batteries replied , but for the first time in our experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in fact , many of our guns were silenced . So many of their horses and men were killed that they could not work their guns , and drew them off the field . Caisson after caisson blowed up , and still the rebels ' fire was fierce and rapid as ever . I kept thinking surely they can not fire much longer , their guns will get so hot they will have to stop , and they can not afford .. to waste so much ammunition .

Photograph The 1st Minnesota 's charge on July 2 , painted by Keith Rocco , blunted the onrushing Confederate attack , saving the Union position on Cemetery Ridge . // It was awful hot where we lay , with the sun shining down on us and we so close to the ground that not a breath of air could reach us . We kept wishing and hoping they would dry up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger ... but Lee had an object to attain by throwing away so much ammunition . He calculated by concentrating his fire on our center that he could use up our batteries , drive away and demoralize our infantry lines , for owing to the shape of our lines , a shell coming from the rebels , if it failed to do any damage to the front lines , could scarcely fail to go into the reserves that lay back of us , and , in fact , many more were killed in the rear than in the front .... Had he succeeded in doing what he expected , and got the position we occupied , we were defeated , and so badly that I much doubt our ability to stop their progress towards Baltimore or anywhere they choose to go . But Mr. Lee got fooled for once , and threw away a mighty sight of good ammunition and derived little benefit from it . Well , after firing about two hours and a half , they slackened up and soon the order came " Be ready for they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and it was not many seconds before every man had on his armor , and was anxiously awaiting the coming of the foe . They had to advance more than half a mile across open fields . They came out of the woods in three lines , and advanced in good order till they got more than half way to us , and in good range of our muskets , which , of course , we used , as did the battery pour grape and canister , when they closed in to their left , and massed together for a charge , on the part of the line held by the Second Philadelphia Brigade of our div . As they closed together , we ( our brigade ) marched by flank to confound them , firing at them continually , pouring most of our shot into their flank , where every shot must tell . The Second Brigade gave away before the rebs got to them , and commenced to fall back . Our brigade was hurried up , and the Third were brought up to the rescue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we charged the rebels just as they had planted one of their colors on one of our guns . A Vermont brigade was sent out to flank them , which they did handsomely . The rebs now seeing the position they had got in , threw away their guns and gave themselves up by hundreds , and thus ended the great assault of Lee on the 3rd . Not enough went back of Maj. Gen. George Pickett 's Division to make a good line of skirmishers . Another line came out on the left shortly afterwards , but they were repulsed as completely as the first , and with the exception of a little artfillery firing , was the last of the fighting at G. During the assault the rebs poured into us lots of shell and grape from their batteries , but we scarce paid any attention to it , having all we could attend to in the infantry . Our boys felt bully during all the fight of the 3rd , and no one thought of running or of the danger , except the Second Brigade , and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance , never were known to stand fire . We took revenge for what they had done to our poor fellows the day before , and never had had such a chance before . DURING THE FIGHT of the 3rd ... every man fought on his own hook , for our division had been so used up the day before , that few officers were left . Generals Hancock and Gibbon were wounded early . Each man ... did all in their power to drive the enemy , without regard to officers , or whether there was any or not . Regiments all mixed up together , and in the last charge nearly all the flags of the div were together in a corner where the rebs got a hold . The flags of the rebel div were about the same , and when the assault was fully repulsed , they lay them on the ground in front of us , for anybody to get who chose , and , as might be expected , the brave men of the Second Brigade were on hand to pick them up when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are welcome , though , to all they can get , for among those who knew them and see them in the fight , they will have to show something besides flags to establish their bravery on that field . The sights on the field were horrible ; by far the worst of any field we have seen ; but I have not the time or disposition to describe them . Never before were our batteries so used up .... The morning of the 4th we drew rations , and plenty of them , and right there , where we had fought the day before , we cooked and eat an hearty breakfast , for by this time we were pretty hungry , and many of us out of grub . That day and the forenoon of the next , our men were busy burying the dead . About noon of the 5th we left the field to follow the rebels , who were now known to be making for the Potomac as fast as possible .
