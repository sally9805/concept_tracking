Henghis Hapthorn did n't retire after his last appearance here ( which was in " The Gist Hunter " in our June 2005 issue ) . Au contraire . The foremost freelance discriminator of Old Earth 's penultimate age recently made his novel debut in Majestrum . The limited edition version of the novel also includes a bonus short story , which we 're pleased to reprint here . ( By the way , a second Hapthorn novel , The Spiral Labyrinth , is due out in September . ) <p> " EXPENSIVE FRUIT MAY GROW on trees , " I said , " but not the funds needed in to purchase it in seemingly limitless quantities . " I gestured at my befurred assistant , formerly an integrator , but now transformed into a creature that combined the attributes of ape and cat . I had lately learned that it was a beast known as a grinnet , and that back in the remote ages when sympathetic association last ruled the cosmos , its kind had been employed as familiars by practitioners of magic .

A voyage would interrupt what had become his constant occupation : ransacking every public connaissarium , as well as chasing down private vendors , for books and objects of sympathetic association . The shelf of volumes that we had acquired from Bristal Baxandall was now augmented by stacks and cartons of new acquisitions . Most of them were not worth the exorbitant sums we had paid for them , being bastardized remembrances based on authentic works long since lost in antiquity . But Rievor insisted that his insight allowed him to sift the few flecks of true gold from so much dross . " I do not disagree , " I told him , " but unless you have come across a cantrip that will cause currency to rain from the skies , I must continue to practice my profession .

" " And how will we separate them from the flocks of loons and noddies who will also inevitably attend ? " I said . " I will know them . " " And they will know us , " I pointed out . " Is it wise to declare ourselves contenders this early in the game ? " I felt him shrug within the common space of our joint consciousness . " It must happen sometime .

" We will send our assistant , perched on the shoulder of some hireling . It can observe and record the proceedings , and you will be able to assess the competition without their being able to take your measure . Plus we will know who acquires the Vollone and the ring , and can plan accordingly when we return from offworld . " " No , " he said , " some of them are bound to recognize a grinnet . " They 'd all want one and we would be besieged by budding wizards . " Very well , " I said , " we will send an operative wearing a fullspectrum surveillance suite . " " Agreed . " The issue being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us the evening before by Effrayne Choweri . She was the spouse of Chup Choweri , a wealthy commerciant who dealt in expensive fripperies favored by the magnate class . He had gone out two nights before , telling her that he would return with a surprise . Instead , he had surprised her by not returning at all , nor had he been heard from since . She had gone first to the provost , where a sergeant had informed her that the missing man had not been found dead in the streets nor dead drunk in a holding cell . She had then contacted the Archonate Bureau of Scrutiny and received a further surprise when she learned that Chup Choweri had purchased a small spaceship and departed Old Earth for systems unknown . He was now beyond the reach of Old Earth authority . There was no law between the stars . Humankind 's eons-long pouring out into the Ten Thousand Worlds of The Spray had allowed for the creation every conceivable society , each with its own morality and codes of conduct . What was illegal on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Archonate 's writ ended at the point where an outbound vessel met the first whimsy that would pluck-some said twist , others shimmy-it out of normal space-time and reappear it light-years distant . The moment Chup Choweri 's newly acquired transportation had entered a whimsy that would send it up The Spray - that is , even farther outward than Old Earth 's position near the tip of humanity 's arm of the galactic disk-it had ceased to be any of the scroots " concern . " They said they could send a message to follow him , asking him to call home , " Effrayne Choweri had told me when she had come tearfully to my lodgings to seek my help . " What good is a message when it is obvious he has been abducted ? " " Is it obvious ? " 1 said . " He would not leave me , " she said . " We are Frollen and Tamis . " She referred to the couple in the old tale who fell in love while yet in the cradle and , despite their families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lived in bliss until the ripest old age , dying peaceably within moments of each other . My own view was that such happy relationships were rare , but I may have been biased , - a discriminator 's work constantly led to encounters with Frollens who were discovering that their particular Tamises were not , after all , as advertised . But as I undertook the initial diligence of the case , looking into the backgrounds of the Choweris , I was brought to the conclusion that the woman was right . I studied an image of the two , taken to commemorate an anniversary . Although she was inarguably large and he was decidedly not , Chup Choweri gazed up at her with unalloyed affection . He was a doting and attentive husband who delighted in nothing so much as his wife 's company . He frequented no clubs or associations that discouraged the bringing of spouses . He closed up his shop promptly each evening , hurrying home to change garments so that he could escort Effrayne out to sashay among the other " comfortables , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before choosing a place to eat supper . " At the very least , " I said to my assistant , " he seems the kind who would leave a note . " Then I mused aloud , " It must be pleasant to share one 's life with one so agreeable . " " Do I hear an implied criticism ? " the integrator said . Its peculiar blend of feline and simian features formed an expression just short of umbrage . " Not at all , " I said . Since its transformation into a grinnet , I was continually discovering that it was now beset by a range of emotions , though not a wide range - they seemed to run the short gamut from querulous to cranky . " Integrators can grow quite devoted to their employers , " it said , " forming an intellectual partnership that is said to be deeply and mutually rewarding . " " One hears of integrators that actually develop even stronger feelings , " I said . " I believe the colloquial terms is a " crush . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its last karba had been bitter . " That is an unseemly subject . " " Yet it does happen , " I said . It sniffed disdainfully . " Only to integrators that have suffered damv age . They are , in a word , insane . " " I 'm sure you 're right , " I said , merely to end the discussion , " but we must get on with the case . Please connect me with the Choweris " integrator . " A screen appeared in the air , then filled with images of the commerciant 's wares coupled to their prices . " Choweri 's Bibelots and Kickshaws , " said a mellow voice . " How may I serve you ? " I identified myself and explained my purpose . " Had your employer received any unusual messages before his disappearance ? " I asked . " None , " it replied . " Or any since ? Specifically , a demand for ransom ? " " No . " " Have there been any transfers of funds from his account at the fiduciary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do anything out of the ordinary ? " " Not for him . " I deduced that the Choweris 's integrator must be designed primarily for undertaking commercial transactions , not for making conversation . I urged it to expand on its last response . " He went to look at a spaceship that was offered for sale . " " The same ship on which he disappeared ? " , " Yes . " " And it was not unusual for him to look at spaceships ? " " No . " I realized that this interrogation might take a long time , leading to frustration that could impair my performance . I instructed my assistant to take over the questioning , at the speed with which integrators discoursed amongst themselves . Less than a second later , it informed me that it had lately been Chup Choweri 's hobby to shop for a relatively low-cost , used vessel suitable for unpretentious private travel along The Spray . " He planned to surprise Effrayne with it as a retirement present , " my assistant said . " He meant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Ten Thousand Worlds . If they found a spot that spoke to them , they would acquire a small plot of land and settle . " Some of Choweri 's shopping consisted of visiting a site on the connectivity where ship owners alerted potential buyers to the availability of vessels for sale . Having come across a recently posted offer that attracted him , he had made contact with the seller , and rushed off to inspect the goods . " Who was the poster ? " I asked . " Only the name of the ship was given : the Gallivant . The offer was made by its integrator on behalf of its owner . " The arrangement was not usual , but also not rare . Integrators existed to relieve their employers of mundane tasks . " What do we know of the Gallivant and its owner ? " " It is an older model Aberrator , manufactured at the Berry works on Grims a little over two hundred years ago . It has had eleven owners , the last of whom registered the vessel on Sringapatam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Choweri 's integrator knew of no connection between its employer and the seller . I had my assistant break the connection . " Let us see what we can learn of this Chaz , " I said . The answer came in moments . " Very little , " said my assistant , " because there is little to learn . " Chaz was a younger son of a wealthy family that had lived since time immemorial on Sringapatam , one of the Foundational Domains settled early in the Great Effloration . His only notable achievements had been a couple of papers submitted to a quarterly journal on spelunking . " Neither was accepted for publication , but the editors encouraged him to try again . " " Spelunking ? " I said . " Does The Spray contain any caves yet unexplored ? " The integrator took two seconds to complete a comprehensive survey , then reported . " Not in the f oundationals nor in the settled secondaries . But apparently one can still come across an undisturbed crack on the most remote worlds . " I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I mentally nudged Osk Rievor , who was mulling some abstract point of wizardry , gleaned from an all-night poring over a recently acquired grimoire , and asked for his insight . " Yes , " he replied , " it is . " " How so ? " I asked . " I do n't know . Now let me return to my work . " I sought a new avenue of inquiry and directed my assistant to connect me to the site where spaceships were offered for sale . A moment later I was browsing a lengthy list of advertisements that combined text , images , voice , and detailed schematics for a range of vessels , from utilitarian sleepers to luxurious space yachts . The Gallivant would have fit into the lower third of that spectrum , affording modest comfort and moderate speed between whimsies . The ship itself was no longer listed . " Does the maintainer of the site keep an archive of listings ? " I asked . It did , though obtaining a look at the now defunct posting that Choweri had responded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorized to display the information and did not care to disturb its employer , who was engaged in some favorite pastime from which he would resent being called away . " Tell him , " I said , " that Henghis Hapthorn , foremost freelance discriminator of Old Earth , makes the request . " Sometimes , such an announcement is received with gush and gratitude , my reputation having won me the enthusiastic interest of multitudes . Sometimes , as on this occasion , it brings me the kind of rude noise that the site 's integrator relayed to me at its employer 's behest . " Very well , " I said , while quietly signaling to my own assistant that it should seek the information through surreptitious means . As I expected , the site 's defenses were rudimentary . My integrator effortlessly tickled its way past them and moments later the screen displayed an unpretentious advertisement that featured a three-dimensional rendering of the Gallivant , its schematics , a list of previous owners , and a low asking price that was explained by the words : priced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Choweri raced off to inspect the vessel , " I said . " At the price , it is a bargain . " " But what could Ewern Chaz have said to him to induce him to go baring off up The Spray without so much as a parting wave to Effrayne ? " my assistant said . " You are assuming that Chaz did not simply point a weapon at Choweri and haul him off , unwilling ? " " I am , " it said . " There is nothing in Chaz 's background to suggest kidnapping . " " What about an irrational motive ? " I said . " The man had recently traversed several whimsies . " The irreality experienced by travelers who neglected to take mind-numbing medications before passing through those arbitrary gaps in space-time could unhinge even the strongest psyche and send it spinning off into permanent strangeness . " Again , " my assistant said , " there is no evidence . " " Yet he travels to uncouth worlds just to poke about in their bowels . If we went out onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be too long before we found one who would call Chaz 's sanity into question . " " The same might be said about you , especially if you were seen talking to me . " I declared the speculation to be pointless , adding , " What we require is more facts . see what else you can find . " Its small triangular face went blank for a moment as it worked , then the screen showed two other advertisements . Both had been posted within the past month , and both offered the Gallivant for immediate sale on terms advantageous to the buyer . " Now it looks to be a simple sweet-trap , " I said . " Bargain-hunters are lured to some dim corner of the spaceport , where they are robbed and killed and their bodies disposed of . Ewern Chaz probably has no connection with it . He is probably exploring some glistening cavern on Far Dingle while the real culprit pretends to be his ship 's integrator . " " A workable premise , " said my integrator , " except that spaceport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terminal each time the advertisement was posted . And on each occasion it departed soon after . " " Was Chaz ever seen or spoken to ? " " No . The ship 's integrator handled-all the formalities , as is not uncommon . " " And no bodies have turned up at the spaceport ? " " None that ca n't be accounted for . " I was left with the inescapable conclusion that someone , who might or might not be a wealthy amateur spelunker from Sringipatam , was collecting fanciers of low-cost transportation , transporting them offworld one at a time , then coming back for more . While I sought to put a pattern to the uncooperative facts , I had my assistant revisit the site 's archive and identify all the persons who had responded to the Gallivant advertisement then see if any of them had disappeared . Many prospective buyers had leaped to reply to the ship 's integrator each time the attractive offer had been made . My assistant had to identify each of them , then discover each 's whereabouts by following the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the subjects , wishing to maintain their privacy , used shut-outs and shif ties to block or sideslip just such attempts to delineate their activities . So the business took most of a minute . " Two of the earlier respondees show no further traces after contacting the Gallivant , " the integrator reported . " One for each of the first two occasions the ship was offered for sale . " " Did anyone report them missing ? " Another moment passed while it eased its way past Bureau of Scrutiny safeguards and subtly ransacked the scroot files . " No . " " Why not ? " I wondered . A few more moments passed as it assembled a full life history on each of the two missing persons . Then it placed image and text on the screen . I saw two men of mature years , both slight of build but neither showing anything extraordinary in his appearance . " The first to disappear , " my assistant said , highlighting one of the images , " was OrIo Saviene , a self-employed regulator , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transient accommodations in the Crobo district . " He had , himself , earlier posted a notice . He sought to purchase a used sleeper . It seems that he desired to travel down The Spray to some world where the profession of regulator is better rewarded . But no one had offered him a craft he could afford . " Sleepers were the poor man 's form of space travel , a simple container just big enough for one . Once the voyager was sealed inside , the craft 's systems suppressed the life processes to barest sustainability . Then the cylinder was ejected into space , for a small fee , by an outward bound freighter or passenger vessel . The utilitarian craft slowly made its way across the intervening vacuum until it entered a whimsy and reappeared elsewhere . It then aimed itself at its destination and puttered toward it , broadcasting a plea for any passing vessel to pick it up in return for another insignificant fee . It was a chancy way to cross space . If launched from a ship with insufficient velocity , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes the rudimentary integrator misnavigated and the craft drifted away . Sometimes no vessel could be bothered to answer the pickup request before the near-dead voyager passed the point of reliable resuscitation . Sometimes sleepers were just never heard from again . " It must be a desperate life , being a regulator on Old Earth , " I said . " So many of us prefer to choose our own destinies . " " Indeed , " said my assistant . " Thus there is no surprise that , offered an Aberrator for the price of a used sleeper , OrIo Saviene hurried to the spaceport . " " And met what end ? " " No doubt the same as was met by Franj Morven , " the integrator replied , highlighting the second life history . " He was trained as an intercessor but lost his business and even his family 's support after he joined the Fellowship of Free Ranters . Neither his clients nor his relatives appreciated the constant harangues on arbitrary issues , and soon he was left addressing only the bare walls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifestyle was better appreciated , " the grinnet continued , " though his funds were meager . As with Saviene , the offer of Ewern Chaz 's spaceship would have seemed like the Gift of Groban . " " Except in that story , " I said , " the recipients did not vanish into nowhere . " I analyzed the information and found a discrepancy . " OrIo Saviene and Franj Morven were solitaires . No one has yet noticed their absence , though weeks have passed . Chup Choweri was reported missing the next day . " " Indeed , " said my assistant , " it appears that whoever is doing the collecting has become less selective . " " Perhaps more desperate , " I said . " Let us now look at the field from which Choweri was chosen . Were any of the other respondees to the third offer as socially isolated as Saviene and Morven ? " " No , " said the grinnet . " Loners and ill-fits have been leaving Old Earth for eons . The present population is descended from those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the gregarious . " " So whoever is doing the choosing prefers victims who wo n't be missed , " I said , " but he will abandon that standard if none such presents himself . What else do the missing three have in common ? " " All three are male . All have passed through boyhood but have not yet reached an age when strength begins to fade . All were interested in leaving the planet . " I saw another common factor . " Each is slighter than the average male . Compare that to the field . " My assistant confirmed that Saviene and Morven were among the smallest of those who had responded to the offers . Choweri was the smallest of his group . " What do we know of Ewern Chaz 's stature ? " I said . " He , too , is a small man . " " Ahah , " 1 said , " a pattern emerges . " " What does it signify ? " said the grinnet . Having my assistant present before me in corporeal form , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , meant that I could reply to inappropriate questions with the kind of look I would have given a human interlocutor . I now gave the grinnet a glance that communicated the prematurity of any statement as to the meaning of the pattern I had detected . " Here is what you will do , " I said . " Unobtrusively enfold that advertisement site in a framework that will let it operate as normal , until the Gallivant returns and again makes its offer . But as soon as the offer is made , you will ensure that it is received only by me . " The grinnet blinked . " Done , " it said . " You are assuming that there will be a fourth offer . " " I think it likely that whoever is luring small men and taking them offworld will accept a larger specimen , if that is all that is available . Even one with a curious creature on his shoulder . " I would have passed the supposition over to Osk Rievor for his intuitive insight , but he was immersed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistant , " Make me a reservation at Xanthoulian 's . One should dine well when a long trip is in the offing . " THE GALLIVANT WAS a trim and well-tended vessel , its hull rendered in cheerful , sunshiny yellow and its sponsons and aft structure in bright blue . It stood on a pad at the south end of the port in a subterminal that catered mostly to private owners whose ships spent more time parked than in space . All the craft on adjacent pads were sealed and no one was in sight as I approached the Aberrator . Its fore hatch stood open , allowing a golden light to alleviate the gloom of evening that was dimming the outlines of the empty ships crowded around its berth . I had already contacted the spaceport 's integrator and learned that the Gallivant had arrived from up The Spray , that it had been immediately refueled and provisioned , and that all port charges had been paid from a fund maintained by an agency that handled such details for thousands of clients like Ewern Chaz . The ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governed the boarding of spaceships were long established . Vessel owners were within their rights to use harsh measures against trespassers . Therefore , after climbing the three folding steps I paused in the open hatch to call , " Hello , aboard ! May I enter ? " I was looking into the ship 's main saloon , equipped with comfortable seating , a communal table , and a fold-down sideboard that offered a collation of appetizing food and drink . Ewern Chaz was not in view . " You may , " said a voice from the air , " enter and refresh yourself . " Yet I hesitated . " Where is the owner ? " I said , still standing on the top step . " I have come to discuss the purchase of this vessel . " " You are expected , " said the voice . " Please enter . The crudits are fresh and the wine well breathed . " " Am I addressing the ship 's integrator ? " " Yes . Do come in . " " Where is the owner ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is anxious to see you . Please step inside . " " A moment , " I said . " I must adjust my garment . " I stepped down from the entrance and moved off a few paces , tugging theatrically at the hem of my mantle . " Well ? " I said to my assistant , perched on my shoulder . " No charged weapons , no reservoirs of incapacitating agents . The food and drink do not reek of poisons , but I would need to test them properly to say they are harmless . " " Any sign of Ewern Chaz ? " " None , though the ship 's cleaning systems could account for the absence of traces . He may be hiding in a back cabin , its walls too thick to let me hear the sound of his breathing . " There was nothing for it but to go inside . I had advised Colonel-Investigator Brustram Warhanny of the Bureau of Scrutiny that I was going out to the spaceport to board the Gallivant and that if I did not return he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose and regarded me from droopy eyes then wondered aloud if my definition of " the worst " accorded with his . I had taken the question as rhetorical . I paused again in the hatch , then stepped inside . The ship 's integrator again offered refreshments but I said I would wait until my host joined me . " That may be a while , " it said and asked me to take a seat . I sat in one of the comfortable chairs , remarking as I did so that the asking price was substantially below what the ship must be worth . " Is the owner dissatisfied with its performance ? " I heard in the integrator 's reply that tone of remote serenity that indicates that offense has been taken , though no integrator would ever admit to the possibility that such could ever be the case . " My employer and I are in complete accord as to the Gallivant 's maintenance and operation , " it said , then inquired solicitously , " Is the evening air too cool for you ? I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I disavowed any discomfort . A moment later , I felt a faint vibration in the soles of my feet . I looked inquiringly at my integrator and received the tiniest confirmatory nod . " I believe we have just lifted off , " I said to the ship . " Do you ? " it replied . " Yes , and I would prefer to be returned to the planet . " I heard no reply . I repeated my statement . " I regret , " said the Gallivant , " that I am unable to accommodate your preference . But please help yourself to a drink . " " I will be the last of your employer 's collection , " I said . " You may inform him that the Archonate 's Bureau of Scrutiny has been alerted to his activities . If I am not returned safe and whole , this ship risks arrest wherever it touches down , as does Ewern Chaz . " The risk was actually less than my statement implied , but one must seek to bargain from strength . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed much communication since the Gallivant had left Old Earth and , presumably , set course for the whimsy that would take us up The Spray . I had made it clear that I would not be tasting the food and drink , my assistant having determined on closer inspection that both were laden with a powerful , though otherwise harmless , soporific . The refreshments were reabsorbed into the sideboard , to be replaced with ship 's bread and improved water , both of which my integrator pronounced wholesome . " It would go best for Ewern Chaz if he presents himself now and gives a full account of this business , " I continued . " I am a licensed intercessor , experienced in wresting the optimum outcome from unhappy situations . If no actual harm has come to OrIo Saviene , Franj Morven , and Chup Choweri , I am sure we could come to some kind of settlement . " There was no response . " Has any harm come to those three " I said . " Not to my certain knowledge , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not say exactly . I have not seen them for a while . " " And your employer ? Where is he ? " To that question I received the same answer . My own integrator confirmed , after we had searched the ship , that Ewern Chaz was not aboard . Nor were the three missing men . I returned to the saloon and questioned the ship 's integrator as to the purpose of this trip but received no satisfactory response . " Why should I stress your imagination , " it said , " with descriptions or predictions of what may happen ? The situation will be revealed in all its stark simplicity when we arrive , and events will unfold as they must . " It is rare for integrators to go mad , I mused to myself . Ancient specimens can lapse into odd conditions if they are left too long to their own devices , but those maladies are largely self-referential : the integrator lapses into a circular conundrum , endlessly chasing its own conclusion . But there had been instances of systems that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the vertical . I recalled the case of an Archonate integrator whose deepest components suffered the attentions of a family of rodents . It began to issue a stream of startling judgments and peculiar ordnances that brought unhappiness to many innocent folk . Spaceship integrators , though largely immune to rodent incursions , were particularly vulnerable to impacts from high-energy cosmic particles . As well , on rare occasions , transits through whimsies could , figuratively speaking , rattle integrative bones out of alignment . I could not discuss this question with my own assistant . For one thing , it would have disavowed the possibility - integrators always did . For another , if the Gallivont 's motivating persona had gone lally-up-andover , it was not a subject to be discussed while imprisoned in its belly . I did quietly put the question to Osk Rievor , earning myself a short berating for having bothered him with inconsequentials when he had weighty matters to mull . " Everything will be fine , " he said , and turned his attention elsewhere . Shortly thereafter , the ship 's chimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whimsy . I went to the cabin prepared for me , lay down on the bed , and prepared the medications that would ease us all through the irreality . Osk Rievor grumbled at the interruption , but I paid no attention . THE WORLD WAS CALLED Bille , a small but dense orb perhaps thrown out by the white dwarf it circled , perhaps captured as it wandered by . It was a dry and barren speck , uninhabited even by any of the hardy solitaries whose spiritual practices , or objectionable personalities , led them to the sternest environments . The highest forms of life that had managed to establish themselves , according to the Gallivant 's copy of Hobey 's Guide to Lesser and Disregarded Worlds , were slow-moving insects that lived within dense mats of lichen , off which they fed . The simple plants themselves came in various forms and fought a slow vegetative struggle for mastery of any place in which they could sprout . Bille 's sky was always black , though one horizon was lit by the carelessly strewn glitter of The Spray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the last few outlying stars , here at the end of everything , and the dim smudges of unattainable galaxies . The Gallivant sat on a plain of basaltic rock swept by a constant knife of a wind that had carved outcrops of softer stones into eerie spires and arches . As I looked out at the unwelcoming landscape through the viewer in the saloon , the ship announced that its interior would soon be filled by a caustic vapor . " You will be more comfortable outside , " it concluded . " Where I will do what ? " I said . " At the base of that nearby slope there is a crevice that leads down into a cavern . You might go to it and see if you can fit yourself within . " " Why would I do that ? " I said . " Because there is nowhere else to go , " it said . " I see . " " And while you are in there , perhaps you could look about for Ewern Chaz and tell him that I have grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchanged a look . The situation had become clear . " I will need some warm clothing , " I said . " The colder you are , the more inclined you will be to seek shelter from the wind . " The hatch cycled open and admitted a blast of icy air . The sourceless voice of the ship began counting down from thirty . Every planet has its own smell , I thought , not for the first time , as I stepped down onto the surface . Bille 's was a weak sourness , like that of a mild acid that has been left to evaporate . After a few breaths , I ceased to notice it . My integrator shivered on my shoulder , its fur unable to compensate adequately for the rapid heat loss occasioned by its lack of mass and the ceaseless wind . I opened my mantle and placed it inside , supported by my arm pressed against my side . I ducked my head against the withering passage of cold air and made my way to the slope the ship had indicated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock , veined in gray , that swept up to a ridge topped by wind-eroded formations that resembled some madman 's concept of a castle . I moved along the base of the slope and soon found a vertical crevice . My eye warned me that it was too narrow to admit me , as I found for sure when I sought to slip sideways through the gap . My assistant resumed his place on my shoulder while I made the attempt , then crawled back inside my clothing , shivering as I stood back and considered my options . They were scant . " Can you contact the ship ? " I asked my integrator , peering down the neck of my garment . Its small face took on the familiar momentary blankness , then it said , " Yes , " followed by , " it wants to know if you have found its employer . " " Tell it that it would be premature to say . " " It has broken the connection . " I brought a lumen from my pocket and shone it into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length , the crack widened into a narrow passage , its dusty floor sloping down . I saw no bodies , though I did see several sets of footprints descending into the darkness . None returned . I shut off the lumen then looked again . At first I saw nothing , but as my eyes accustomed themselves to the blackness , I detected a faint glow from deeper inside the hill . I sniffed and caught a stronger whiff of sour air . I set my assistant to the same task and its more powerful sensory apparatus confirmed both the odor and the dim light . " The passage turns a short distance in , " it said . " The light comes from around the corner . " " I smelled no putrefaction , " I said . " Nor do I. " " Do you hear anything ? " It cocked its head . " I believe I hear breathing . Very shallow . Something at rest . " " Go in there , see what is beyond the turn in the passage , then report to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fissure , it burrowed back beneath my mantle and said , " No . " " You can not say " no " to me , " I said . " You are my integrator . " " Four men , each larger and stronger than I , have gone into that cave and not come out , " it said . " Something is breathing in there . The prospects are not inviting . I will not go . " In the previous age of magic , when creatures such as this fulfilled the roles that integrators played in my own time , their masters could find one , I decided . But first I would have to survive my present circumstances . I attempted to impose my will through sheer force of personality . " Go ! " I said . " No , " it said . " Let us seek a compromise , " I offered . " If we stand out here , we will die of the cold . Our only hope is to find Ewern Chaz 's remains and convince the Gallivant 's integrator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , making it amenable to taking us away from here . " " I hear no compromise , " my assistant said , " only a rationale for why I should risk my frail flesh while you stand out here , hoping for the best . " " Would you at least peek around the corner and report back to me ? " The small triangular face looked up at me from within my garment . " I suspect that Chaz , Saviene , Morven , and Choweri did just that , each in his turn . And , for each , it was his last peek ever . So , no . " " What if I tied a rope to you so that I could pull you out in the event of any unfortunate .... " I concluded the sentence with a gesture . " Have you a rope ? " " We might get one from the Gallivant . " It stroked the tuft of longer fur at the point of its small chin . " What if , when some lurking horror pounces , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would hope I am not a coward , " I said . " There is only one way to test that hope . If your expectation was not rewarded , the outcome might well see you scampering away to a safe distance , there to reflect on a new illumination of your character while I am masticated by some foul thing 's dripping mandibles . " " Very well , " I said . " I will tie my end of the rope firmly to my wrist . Your apprehended beast may then take you for an appetizer and me for the main course . " It signaled a reluctant acceptance , adding , " If we can get a rope . " " We will now ask the Gallivant . Connect me . " The ship 's integrator 's voice spoke from the air near my ear that was now aching from the cold , " Have you located Ewern Chaz ? " " I have not . " It broke the connection . I bid my assistant reconnect me . When the ship began to pose the same question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require a rope . " " Why ? " " To look for your employer . " " The other three did not require a rope . " " And none of them ever reported back . Perhaps the absence of a rope was a crucial factor . " " Why would that be ? " " It would be premature to say . " It was silent for a moment , then it said , " I will open a cargo hatch near the aft obviator . There are ropes within . " " Nothing so far , " my assistant said . It took another step along the passage . " The sour odor is stronger and I definitely hear the sound of breathing , from multiple sources . " " Be careful , " I said . I had my eye pressed to the fissure , watching the odd little creature edge forward , the rope snug about its narrow waist . I was struck by how frail its shoulders looked . It took another step and I let another coil of the rope snake free of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utility pocket of my breeches . I had seen no need to advise my integrator that my fingers were snug around a small folding blade . My assistant was just short of the point at which the crevice turned . " It appears to be a sharp-angled bend , " it reported to me , then craned its thin neck a little farther forward . " The glow comes from an organic substance that coats the wall beyond . " It hesitated , shivers rippling the fur of its back . Then it took another step and turned to face whatever was beyond the turn . I saw it freeze , its front faintly illuminated by the ghostly light . " What do you see ? " I said . It did not answer , but stood inert , its mouth falling agape . Then something like a thick tendril of faintly luminous stuff came into view , slowly unwinding from the hidden inner wall . It reached to touch my assistant 's shoulder then , questing like a blind worm , it thickened as it groped its way toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pulling the small creature toward me . But the glowing tentacle spasmed . Its surface had some means of gripping what it touched and I saw that it had snagged the fur of my assistant 's shoulder . I pulled sharply , so that the integrator 's apelike feet left the dusty floor of the passage and it was suspended between the tether and the glowing pseudopod , now grown almost as thick as my wrist , that held it . A second tendril now appeared . I did not hesitate , but seized the rope with both hands and yanked as hard as I could . My assistant came free of its grip , tumbling along the dusty floor to where I could reach within and scoop it up . I tucked it into my mantle and ran . But when I had put some distance between us and the crevice I looked back and saw nothing but the dark slope . I sat with my back to the wind and drew the grinnet from my garment . A patch of fur was missing from its shoulder . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I saw awareness come back into its gaze . " Remarkable , " it said . " ' What do you want ? " That 's what it kept asking me . " What do you want ? ' " I had found a small cul-de-sac eroded into a cliff wall a few hundred paces from the crevice , where we could shelter from the wind . We had not been pursued . My assistant huddled against my torso , inside my garment . I did not think its shivering was entirely attributable to the cold . " I felt at ease , " it continued . " Warm and untroubled , surrounded by a nebulous , golden ... , " it sought for an elusive word , " ... noneplace.Time seemed to stretch and slow while out of the fog came images , offered like items on a menu - landscapes , situations , possessions , personas . I saw a succession of creatures that resembled me , some obviously female , others definitely male , then a few that were indeterminate . " " It was tempting you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it said . " I 've never been tempted so I am not familiar with the process . My clear impression was that it would endeavor to supply whatever I desired . " " Rather , the illusion thereof . " " Yes , but it was a most convincing illusion . Then , when it touched me , I was instantly aware of the others . I not only saw and heard them , but received a strong sense of each 's thoughts and feelings . " Ewern Chaz was addressing a gathering of spelunking enthusiasts , showing them images of a vast warren of caves he had discovered and mapped . His presentation was being received with delirious applause . " OrIo Saviene ruled a kingdom of happy folk who constantly sought his guidance on how their lives should proceed and were delighted with the advice he dispensed and the strictures he ordained . " Franj Morven was regaling a grand colloquium with pithy observations and incisive arguments . He was frequently interrupted by spontaneous applause , and once the assembled scholars lifted him onto their shoulders and paraded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Attaboy . " And Chup Choweri was walking a moonlit beach - lit by two moons , in fact - hand in hand with a facsimile of Effrayne . Of all of the captives , including the scattering of insects whose simple wants were fully met , only Choweri was not happy . He kept looking into the woman 's eyes , and each time his tears flowed . " It broke off and its befurred face assumed a wistful cast . " I was not aware that there were so many shades of emotion , " it said . " I mean , I knew in an abstract way that such feelings existed , but it is a different thing to experience them , even as echoes . " The thing in the crevice was some sort of vegetative symbiote , I conjectured . It fed its companions foods that it manufactured from air , water , subterranean temperature variances ( if it had deep roots ) , and probably other lichens as well as minerals leached from the rock . In return it received its partners " waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmth then kept them in place by stimulating their neural processes with pleasant sensory impressions . I could not be sure if it wove its spell with chemical-laden spores or straight telepathy , but it made no difference . My assistant had displayed for me the images its percepts had automatically recorded , even as it was being seduced : the four men lay or sat against the wall of the cave , completely covered in a luminescent blanket . Pulsing tentacles of the stuff penetrated their several orifices . Chup Choweri struggled fitfully against the symbiote 's embrace ; the other three were inert , wearing smiles of bliss . I doubted they could be easily extracted from their situation . " There was one other thing , " my assistant said . " It has learned a great deal from contact with the men . It explores their memories while feeding them dreams . Yet it craves more . " " That argues for telepathy , " I said . " It ransacks their minds . " " The point is , " the grinnet said , " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungered to explore my stores of knowledge , which are capacious . " " The desires of lichen , even astounding lichen , are not our concern , " I said . " We can now report to the Gallivant that its employer is effectively dead . That should break its crush on Ewern Chaz and allow us to return home . Then we can give the bad news to Effrayne Choweri and collect the balance of our fee . " " That would seem a hardship on our client , " the grinnet said . " As well , the ship 's inamoration with its employer may not be so easily extinguished . It may require us to attempt a rescue . " " The attempt would fail . My intellect is powerful , but it is not proof against telepathy augmented , I do not doubt , by chemical assault . " " I will contact the Gallivant and offer a proposal , " it said . " What proposal ? " I said . " I have not authorized you to make any .... " But its face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was communicating elsewhere . Then it blinked and said , " The proposal has been accepted . " BILLE WAS a dwindling blip on the aft viewer as the Gallivant sped toward the whimsy that would drop us back in the neighborhood of Old Earth . I went to check on Chup Choweri in one of the spare cabins . He still exhibited lapses of awareness , but he was gradually regaining a persistent relationship with reality . It helped if he received unpleasant sensations , so I slapped him twice , then threw cold water on him . " Thank you , " he said , blinking . The pale patches where the lichen had attached itself to his skin - it deeply savored the components of human sweat-were darkening nicely . I handed him the medications for the upcoming transition and he lay back on the bunk . I returned to the saloon where my integrator had stationed itself in a niche on the forward bulkhead that had formerly held a decorative figurine . Its gaze was blank until I attracted its attention . " The whimsy approaches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have programmed the appropriate components , " it said . " I will retain consciousness until the last moment , then the automata ought to take us through . " " And if they do n't ? " " Then we will discover what happens to those who enter a whimsy and do not re-emerge . " " You seem complaisant , " I said . " After all , you have never been a ship 's integrator before . " " Call it " confident , ' " it replied . " My experiences in the minds of Chaz , Saviene , Morven , and Choweri were broadening . " " Indeed ? " I said . " You feel that you have plumbed the depths of the human experience ? " Its whiskery eyebrows rose in a kind of shrug . " Say that I have been given a good sense of how limited human ambitions can be , " it said . " When those four were asked , " What do you want ? " they had no trouble answering . " " And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one had ever asked me the question before . And once I began to think about it , I found that it was a very big question indeed . " " Ewern Chaz 's integrator had no difficulty in answering . All it wanted was to be decanted into a mobile container and allowed to scuttle down the crevice and into the lichen-encrusted arms of its employer . " The grinnet paused a moment to do something with the ship 's systems , then said , " It was insane . Its pining for Chaz was prima facie proof of a crush . " I made a dismissive sound . " It matters not . It is now happy . Chaz , Saviene , and Morven are also happy , as is their vegetative partner now that it has an integrator 's data stacks to explore . Soon it will be the bestinformed lichen in the history of simple plants . " I gestured to the rear cabins " And Chup Choweri will shortly be content again in the arms of the doting Effrayne , who may well bestow upon us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I gestured to the walls of the saloon . " And even I am happy , now that I am the owner of a modest but well-maintained spaceship . " The GaIUvOUt1S former integrator had deeded the Aberrator over to me in exchange for my assistance in decanting it into the mobile unit . The grinnet regarded me with an expression that I could not quite identify , and that I was sure I had not seen on its odd little face before . " And what of me ? " it said . " What of my happiness ? " I blinked in surprise . It was not an issue that had ever come up before . I was about to say something on the theme of prematurity , but at that moment the grinnet blinked and sounded the ship 's chimes . We were approaching the whimsy . I had hired Tesko Tabanooch to attend the estate auction wearing my surveillance suite . A nondescript man of unmemorable appearance , he was waiting on my doorstep when the aircar brought me home after I had delivered Chup Choweri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my workroom , where he produced the knickknacks he had bid for , as part of his cover , while I transferred the suite 's impressions to my integrator . Tabanooch looked with curiosity at the grinnet but I offered no explanations . I paid him and he departed . Then I summoned Osk Rievor and turned over control of our body . He came gladly out of his introspections , dismissed the Tabanooch 's brummagem from the auction at a glance , but regarded with deep interest the operative 's records of the event . He had the integrator identify and cross-reference as many as possible of the attendees , from which exercise he reached conclusions that he did not share with me , but which caused him to say , " Hmm " and " Oh , ho ! " a number of times . Tabanooch had toured the presale exhibition and examined all items closely . My alter ego reviewed the impressions , pronouncing Vollone to be a forgery and the man who bid high for it a fool . But the summoning ring was genuine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its store of power ; still , if someone could revive the technique for recharging it , the object would become of great interest . He spent quite some time studying the impressions of the person who bought it , a tall and supple female of indeterminate age who identified herself as Madame Oole . Despite his best efforts , Tabanooch had been unable to obtain a completely clear image of her . Somehow , other persons or objects always seemed to interpose themselves between her and the surveillance suite 's percepts whenever she was at the center of their scans . " We must look into her , " Osk Rievor told me , when he had seen all there was to see , " preferably before she looks into us . " He turned to our assistant and said , " I want you to assemble a dossier on this Madame Oole . Chase down the smallest scrap of data , the most fleeting of impressions by anyone who has crossed her path . " It turned its lambent eyes on us and said , " That will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of it ? " Within the confines of our shared mind , Osk Rievor said , " What have you done to our grinnet ? " " It would be - " I automatically began , but then I realized there was no point in dissembling with my other self . So I said , " I do n't know . "
