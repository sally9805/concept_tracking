The scraggly cornstalks sprouting from pots in Andy Hiatt 's laboratory do n't look particularly unusual . But woven into their DNA is a tiny strip of mankind : a human gene that codes for an antibody to a sexually transmitted disease  --  genital herpes  --  that afflicts some 60 million Americans . When the corn plants mature and produce kernels , Hiatt 's company , Epicyte Pharmaceutical of San Diego , hopes to turn them into a topical gel for herpes . <P> And that 's just for starters . Epicyte is one of a host of biotech companies that have seized on the information in the map of the human genome  --  a map that was officially declared complete last month  --  to create all manner of plant-based pharmaceuticals . Researchers have launched more than 300 trials of genetically engineered crops to produce everything from fruit-based hepatitis vaccines to AIDS drugs grown in tobacco leaves . They call this biopharming . <P> Critics  --  and there are many  --  have another name for it . They call it Pharmageddon . Environmentalists are worried that the unnaturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread like genetic kudzu . Consumer advocates , who have never warmed to today 's genetically modified foods , fear that plant-grown drugs and industrial chemicals will end up on their dinner tables . Hoping to head off a public revolt , the Federal Government is putting the finishing touches on new regulations aimed at reassuring the grocery industry that human-based crops will not contaminate the food supply . <P> But the proposed rules are not satisfying the critics or slowing the biopharmers . Open-air trials of pharmaceutical crops have taken place in 14 states , from Hawaii to Maryland . A Texas firm is selling a corn-bred enzyme that stimulates insulin production in diabetics . Clinical trials have begun for experimental crop-grown drugs to treat cystic fibrosis , non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma and hepatitis B. " Molecular farming represents the pharmaceutical industry 's best opportunity to strike a serious blow against such global diseases as AIDS , Alzheimer 's and cancer , " says Francois Arcand , president of the Conference on Plant-Made Pharmaceuticals , held in Quebec City earlier this year . <P> What 's driving this effort to morph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the past decade , the DNA revolution has spawned a generation of drugs made from human antibodies , the proteins that white blood cells use to defend the body against disease . Today such " biologics " are cultivated in huge fermentation vats , often by painstakingly planting cloned human cells in such unlikely breeding sites as the ovary cells of Chinese hamsters . Building one of these sophisticated biofactories can take as long as seven years and cost up to $600 million . <P> Achieving the same results through biopharming  --  splicing antibodies into the genetic fabric of plants , growing them in fields and extracting and purifying them  --  could cut costs by half . " If you do n't have to spend half a billion , then more products can advance to the marketplace , " says Arizona State University researcher Charles Arntzen . The opportunities , he points out , are not limited to human drugs . Arntzen foresees rich markets for plant-grown vaccines to protect fish and poultry against diseases now being treated  --  and in many cases overtreated  --  with conventional antibiotics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
