A distant flute plays a dirge in the background . It gets louder and closer as slowly , very slowly , the curtains rise . A red glow envelops everything onstage . Moments later the glow fades out and there is total darkness . The flute plays on . PROF . DR . KADIDI koMUDIMA PhD , America , a small restless , tired-looking man , 60 or so years old , dressed in a once expensive but now faded threadbare business suit , brief-case and torch in hand , enters the living room through the main door . He hears the flute and stops to listen thoughtfully for a moment . As the flute begins fading out he lets out a worded but barely audible sigh . He slowly , very slowly , surveys the room with the aid of his torchlight painfully shaking his head . His wife NEKESA , a simple , composed , middle-aged lady , putting on a sleeping gown , carries a candle into the living room from the bedroom . NEKESA ( Cheerfully ) . Welcome back , my dear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candle ! A pollutant ? I ca n't breathe . The air is stale . ( They stare at each other for a few moments . KADIDI goes to try the switches ; there is no power , he speaks almost to himself . ) They ca n't do that to a Professor ! It must be one of those bloody fuses blown up again . . . ( A long searching pause . Then he bursts out . ) Goddammit ! The **41;303;TOOLONG cutthroats ! Their only function is to rise to the top of the food chain . The Darwinians have us trapped . Through organised greed they suffocate any honest man they can lay their filthy hands on . The devils entangle , devour and damn everything in junkdom . How does an honest , selfless man like Professor Dr. Kadidi koMudima PhD , survive in this rot ? p. 3 NEKESA Take it easy , honey . ( Leads him to the sofa and helps him sit down , still holding his briefcase . ) You look tired . You 're so late . I was getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I do n't believe it . ( His voice rising ) I do n't believe it ! No ! The whole thing was a hoax . Yes ! It was a hoax ! NEKESA We 'll try another time . DR . KADIDI Not me again . Lotteries are NOT well organised in this country ! This last one was a complete hoax . With well over a thousand tickets I was supposed to have won at least one of the top prizes . I was the favourite ! How come I did not get even a consolation prize ? NEKESA We will have our day . We were unlucky today . DR . KADIDI ( With force . ) What 're you talking about ? ' Am NOT the sort of man who depends on luck to get ahead . I do n't depend on luck to get ahead . NO , I DO N'T ! I am an enlightened man endowed with both tenacity and judgment . Mathematically , I was supposed to be the undisputed winner , but then I did n't even get a consolation prize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tickets I was supposed to be the clear winner . p. 4 NEKESA It does not work out that way . DR . KADIDI What do you know ? NEKESA My dear , luck is not based on numbers . DR . KADIDI ( Rising , bitter may be at himself more than he is at NEKESA . ) IGNORAMUS ! Did n't you learn anything about probability during your school days ? ( Silence . ) According to the laws of probability , I had one thousand chances of winning the millions . I was the favourite ! NEKESA On your lucky day , you need only one ticket to win the prize . DR . KADIDI That 's not scientific thinking ! I do n't like people who talk for the sake of pronouncing words . You must talk sense where I am . You are always making me lower my ideals . I can not do anything in this home , however noble , without being unjustly condemned ! NEKESA I did n't mean to insult you , my dear . DR . KADIDI Who am I not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Anarchy is not my cup of tea . NEKESA I am sorry . DR . KADIDI You 're sorry , my foot ! Blow off that candle and go to bed ! What 're you doing still up and about at this late hour , anyway ? ( NEKESA does not blow out the candle . She takes it with her back into the bedroom leaving KADIDI in darkness . He then switches on his torch , finds his way back to the sofa , drops into it a beaten man . He switches off the torch . Moments later his music is heard in the background as slowly the special lights fill the living room . He stirs and moves to address , physically , a point off stage. ) p. 5 DR . KADIDI ( Bubbling with joy ) . Darling , I am home ! ( A younger NEKESA , putting on tights and carrying a basket of washing , appears from the direction KADIDI is addressing . ) NEKESA ( With youthful energy ) Oh ! Welcome back , honey . ( They embrace . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good News ? NEKESA Sure ? DR . KADIDI The only news that 's good news ! I had a very successful week . NEKESA Is that so ? You 've been away for so long I was beginning to get worried . DR . KADIDI I was busy . Things are slowly beginning to sort themselves out . We will be very rich soon . NEKESA Oh ! That 'll be nice . DR . KADIDI ( Full of himself ) . We 'll be living in a grand mansion soon . NEKESA Wow ! DR . KADIDI I have bought a big plot in town  --  five acres . I am going to build my own house , stone by stone . p. 6 NEKESA If the money is there , why not buy a ready-made home . That way we 'll occupy it immediately . DR . KADIDI Such a contraption can not be a home . A house built in the owner 's absence has no philosophical value . NEKESA I do n't get you . DR . KADIDI If the house will by my home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper myself , the way Americans do . I will be there at the building site in fatigues , American fatigues and boots , to supervise all the work . I 'll be there to witness and record the philosophical change take place . I am the midwife . I have to supervise the gravel , stone , air , fire , cement , water , energy , labour , time , you name it . . . I have to attend to the elements as they transfer the house plan from paper into a solid structure on the ground , to form the home in which I will spend my remaining years on this planet . I must witness the houseness becoming of the cosmic interaction of intellect , matter and time occasioned by my desire for an anchor in the universe . I must approve and record every stage in my mind for posterity as it becomes . NEKESA ( At a loss . ) That 's very interesting . DR . KADIDI ( Impressed . ) Very interesting indeed ! It is no baby-stuff to stand by and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will be a grand home . And when it 's my time to die , I will pass it over to Kadidi Junior . Nobody but my line will forever own it . p. 7 NEKESA How much is it going to cost ? DR . KADIDI Millions of shillings , rough estimate . NEKESA My goodness ! We do n't have that kind of money ! DR . KADIDI That 's nothing in mighty American dollars . NEKESA I thought we use the shilling back here . DR . KADIDI The exchange rate is what I mean . Look . I left a lot of wealth back home in the States . ( With pride ) My budget used to read like that of some Third World countries . NEKESA Are you sure ? ( Pause . ) If you had so much why have we been suffering all this time ? DR . KADIDI I wanted to get the pure woman first . It is a universal law that if you want to miss an honest and true wife , flout your wealth before you 're married . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NEKESA How can you be a married bachelor ? DR . KADIDI Simple ! Your wallet marries while you remain a bachelor . And as soon as the wallet dies the wife 's gone . NEKESA We have been married and suffered for years . You ought to have told me about your American wealth . p. 8 DR . KADIDI I wanted to get the money here first . It 's not been easy . But with the help of some special agents , I have managed to get some of it over . Right now I have millions in my account . ( Pause . Nekesa is at a loss . ) I left the States in a hurry . The FBI was on my heels . I led a student demonstration against globalisation . It was supposed to be peaceful but it got out of hand , became riotous , lives were lost . More lives were lost when the FBI tried to arrest me . A darling of all the American universities could not be arrested . NEKESA I do n't understand you . DR . KADIDI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow all round . A living riddle is what they called me back in the States . I had lots of money . I will do my best to repatriate the remaining stuff . Our Government will help me . I have the entire Government here . ( Points at his trouser pockets and gives off a short , sharp self-appraising laugh ) . I want to do the building first . The sooner we get out of this bed-sitter hovel the better . Our new home will be on Liberty Hill . NEKESA That 's an expensive special place . DR . KADIDI The Vatican ! The Archbishop resides there . Government ministers , big businessmen . . . all respectable people stay out there . Our neighbours will be men and women of high social standing . When you go to church , the air alone will be enough to give you the refreshment you need . There is nothing like rubbing shoulders with lousy nuts . I just do n't understand how people survive in such junk places . p. 9 NEKESA It is not difficult for those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to a five-star hotel immediately . It is bye to hovels ! NEKESA How am I going to manage when we move to Liberty Hill ? DR . KADIDI Why ? NEKESA Liberty Hill is miles away from my work place at the Baraka Nursing Home . DR . KADIDI That 's nothing to worry you . As a true patriot you 'll kindly drop that job to give a less fortunate fella the chance to earn a morsel . NEKESA I will not do that . DR . KADIDI We do n't need that money any more . And besides , you 've been exposing me to infection , interacting with the infested . NEKESA I do n't work just for the money . I love my job . DR . KADIDI I hope not more than you love me . ( NEKESA is silent . ) You 'll put aside your love for a job to pursue your love for a superior cause . NEKESA And do nothing all my life ! ? DR . KADIDI There 'll be a lot for you to do at the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your hands will be full supervising them . It will be a lot of work . Nevertheless , I am confident you 'll handle it because the food will be equally nutritious . p. 10 NEKESA Gosh ! DR . KADIDI That 's right . NEKESA Will you drop your teaching job at the school ? DR . KADIDI Not on your life . I will be driving there every morning . I am going to import a grand America car . And as a special honour , you 're the one going to make the choice . I will send out orders to CEOs of all American car manufacturers , asking for data on all the models they produce - the latest designs only . NEKESA Is that possible ? DR . KADIDI There 's the power of the Internet . And besides , all American car manufacturers know me personally . Americans are very interesting . It 's not easy to understand them . They 'll do anything under the sun to promote their frontiers . Carry their banner and they 'll lick your boots . They 're mercenaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me they will drape their flag over a water closet just to keep their rivals out . American-styled democracy stops at nothing . Their liberty crushes humanitarianism NEKESA They must be a horrible lot . DR . KADIDI On the contrary , the contradictions make them a great people in all places and at all times . They have no scruples . They drive posh cars  --  all home made . Six-door Mercedes gas guzzling limousines and what have you . p. 11 NEKESA Is Mercedes American ? DR . KADIDI I have no time for small things . You do n't expect me to waste my time knowing car manufacturers . That 's why it will be you to choose the car we buy . I will be very busy teaching . NEKESA Why should you keep your job while I lose mine ? DR . KADIDI I possess something that belongs to the whole world . It 's my duty to serve mankind . My PhD has to help the youth grow into responsible human beings . The world wo n't spare me if I sit on it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? DR . KADIDI All university doors are wide open to me . I have received several letters asking me to go and head Philosophy Departments in global universities but I am not interested . NEKESA A university job is the right thing for your big brains . DR . KADIDI I professed knowledge at so many top American universities that I came to hate the dull job . I 've headed Philosophy Departments at big universities . I wo n't chain myself down to that business again , and more so not at a third rate university like what we have here . NEKESA You ought to take on that university job . It 's your right and duty . p. 12 DR . KADIDI ( Teasing ) . I can see you want to be a university don 's wife ? ( Giggles ) You 're still lost in primitive concepts about quality . ( Almost to himself . ) A university job ai nt no big stuff . Look , you do n't reach many people that way . The educational sieve in this country eliminates the majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucky see the inside of a university . You have to be a rich man 's child to make it through the system . NEKESA That 's not your business . If you hope to do anything meaningful with that PhD then accept the university job they have been begging you to take up . DR . KADIDI You do n't understand the world of PhDs . It 's too advanced and complex . You 're not qualified to contribute anything substantial to the debate . Leave it to me to take on the opposition . You know absolutely nothing . NEKESA On the contrary I know what is basic . You do n't begin feeding an infant hard foods before it 's well through the liquids . DR . KADIDI Baby talk . Look at that superficiality in your profession . There is nothing to a nurse but feeding and washing babies , patients and blah blah blah . . . . You end up with nothing but babel and baby talk hanging about that nursing home . p. 13 NEKESA ( Hurt . ) That 's unfair . DR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself ) . There 's what philosophers call act and potency in material reality : the hylomorphism theory . . . . Yes . The kids I teach at high school are actually in high school but potentially at the university . ( With pride , tapping his head . ) It demands brains such as these to see and deal with this dual aspect of material reality . I am going to accelerate their actualisation process to such an extent that they will be college chaps long before they see the inside of a university . NEKESA ( Holding out ) . How about the pay ? They give you peanuts at the secondary school . DR . KADIDI ( Full of himself ) I have enough money to see me comfortably through my life . I was an early riser . I do n't have to resort to bloodstained money to survive . NEKESA You have to get your due back here in your own homeland . We have got to leave something reasonable behind to your children when we go . We wo n't do that eating what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way she came in ) . p. 14 DR . KADIDI ( After her . ) That may be so , but I do n't like the way parents are robbed of their hard-earned money in the name of school-fees . The boarding and tuition facilities given in return are substandard to say the least . NEKESA ( Off stage ) . Are you 're going to work for no pay ? DR . KADIDI Given my noble upbringing , I will accept whatever little money they offer as a gesture of my good manners . But the money will not motivate me . ( Looks at his watch ) . I 've to get going . I 'll be back later for the Last Supper in this hovel before we move off to a better place . ( KADIDI moves to make his " exit " through the main door ) NEKESA ( Calling from bedroom ) . My dear , it 's late . You must be tired . You 've had a very busy day . Come and rest . ( The blue lights fade out as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her sleeping gown as before . ) DR . KADIDI HOW AM I GOING TO SURVIVE IN THIS MESS ? ! NEKESA Come , it 'll soon be midnight . DR . KADIDI What ? p. 15 NEKESA ( Moving closer to him . ) It 's late and you 're tired . Get some rest . It will soon be midnight . DR . KADIDI ( On the brink of tears . ) That candle ! Why 're you holding it ? ( Silence ) . Why 're you bent on insulting me ? Why that candle ? ( She does not answer him . ) I ca n't help it . I am not responsible for power blackouts ! ( Long pause within which he sits at the dinning table . ) Get me something to eat . NEKESA There 's some food in the kitchen . I 'll warm it for you DR . KADIDI Why did n't you do that as soon as I came in ? NEKESA I thought you ate out as you had said you would . DR . KADIDI Yes , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn how to communicate with reality . It 's a show of bad manners to bombard me with problems before I rest . She is not a wife who does n't care about her husband 's welfare . NEKESA That 's unfair . DR . KADIDI Shut up ! ( Pause ) Get me a glass of cold water . ( NEKESA enters the kitchen carrying the burning candle . Meanwhile , KADIDI with the help of his torch , is testing the telephone . It is not functioning . He bangs the receiver , a barely audible curse on his lips . As NEKESA brings in the water , KADIDI reaches for the bottle and glass ) . p. 16 DR . KADIDI ( With force ) . WHAT IS THIS YOU HAVE DONE ? ! NEKESA What 's it , my dear ? DR . KADIDI Adding insult to injury ! Since when did I begin drinking water straight from the tap ? ( NEKESA is quiet ) . Hey , I am talking to you . ( Silence . He shouts in a commanding voice . ) Stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . NEKESA I boiled the water . DR . KADIDI ( Mimics her . ) I boiled the water . Is that all ? ( Pause . ) I know there 's nothing more to be said . You stayed behind doing nothing but playing with embryonic human beings and dreaming about the national lottery . ( Pause . ) Get me ice-cold water before I lose my temper . NEKESA There 's no ice-cold water , my dear . DR . KADIDI My fridge uses both power and gas . So do n't tell me there 's no electricity in the house . ( Silence . ) Does the silence mean you did n't put any water in the fridge ? NEKESA We do n't have a fridge . p. 17 DR . KADIDI I do n't own a fridge ? How do you mean ? ( Silence ) Have you suddenly gone nuts ? There 's a brand new fridge inside that kitchen . I bought a fridge last Christmas . I bought it cash with my own money . NEKESA They came for it . ( KADIDI runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KADIDI Why did n't you stop the thieves ? NEKESA How ? DR . KADIDI You should have stopped them . That is a case of broad daylight robbery . I paid for that fridge . They can not take it back without first refunding my money . It 's robbery ! ( Back in the sitting room with a new awareness . ) My goodness ! What else was taken ? NEKESA All the items we took on hire purchase . Everything was taken . The seven days we were given to clear the arrears expired yesterday . DR . KADIDI ( On the verge of tears . ) That 's very unfair . It is unjust and immoral . It is wrong ! It 's cancerous this grip within and without by the chains of junkdom . Ours is a defeated society . You ca n't take time off to look sideways and hope to survive . Man is sliding down a steep slope in utter confusion . Biblical scholars called it the Tower of Babel , I call it Junkdom - the disintegration of spiritual values in material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pyjamas descends the stairs into the living room . He carries an electrical lamp in one hand and a glass of water in the other. ) p. 18 ODIEMO Hello , brother . DR . KADIDI ( Bewildered . ) Ala ! Odiemo ! Big brother , when did you come ? ODIEMO This afternoon . DR . KADIDI ( To NEKESA ) . I do n't understand you , woman . Why did n't you tell me my esteemed brother had honoured me with a special visit ? NEKESA I wanted you to rest . You have the whole day tomorrow to talk to him . DR . KADIDI ( Shaking his hand . ) How 're you , big brother ? ODIEMO Fine . Very fine . DR . KADIDI I hope you do n't mind the candle . Electricity is rationed , you know . ODIEMO There 's nothing wrong with the candle . DR . KADIDI It is good you 're around . I really wanted to see you . ODIEMO I will be in town till tomorrow afternoon . I came to buy farm inputs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ODIEMO Not bad . The rains are irregular . But I am trying my best to manage it . p. 19 DR . KADIDI Move away from rain-fed agriculture to irrigation . ODIEMO Irrigation systems are expensive to put up and I do n't have the money . DR . KADIDI I can fix you a cheap drip irrigation system at the flick of a finger . Nevertheless , if that is not a viable option , then try some of those GM crops . ODIEMO GM crops , what are they ? DR . KADIDI Biotechnology . A natural response of American science faced with starving millions around the world . GM means genetically modified . The crops ' genes have been modified to make them super crops . They yield a hundredfold under adverse conditions . They have natural ingredients that kill pests and disease causing agents . Fires , droughts , blizzards , come what may , they will still yield as if nothing has happened . ODIEMO I 've never heard of them . DR . KADIDI Such information is not available in the villages . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward for all farmers who wish to be around longer . ODIEMO ( Without interest . ) I might give it some serious consideration if I get to learn more about them . DR . KADIDI That 's quite encouraging . I 'll put you through to the NASA laboratories in the USA once you are ready . They 're my friends . They 'll fall over each other to help my big brother . p. 20 ODIEMO ( Keen to change the topic ) . How are you doing ? DR . KADIDI ( Full of himself ) . As you can see , I am doing quite well . My only problem is that I have a lot of work on my hands . I come home late every day . ODIEMO Do you have to work so hard even on Sundays ? DR . KADIDI I tell you , one day I will drop down dead . Teaching , marking term papers , supervising those writing their thesis in various fields , and offering extra tuition classes from Monday to Sunday every week . But somehow I manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glass of water . ) Here . I have got some cold water for you . DR . KADIDI ( Takes the glass with a smile . ) Oh . Do you 've a portable fridge upstairs ? ODIEMO I carry it along wherever I go . DR . KADIDI Technology has made life a lot more comfortable . ODIEMO Appropriate technology I should say . What I have upstairs is a small African fridge . DR . KADIDI An African fridge ? When and by who was it invented ? ( KADIDI drinks the water ) . p. 21 ODIEMO It has been in use over the centuries . DR . KADIDI ( Showing appreciation ) . The water is fairly cold . It is quite good . But I 've never heard of an African invention  --  not a toy not a functional item . ODIEMO The African fridge is the earthen pot ? DR . KADIDI Goddamit ! What the hell 's this you 've done to me . ( Shoves the glass at him . ) Take back what remains of your slime from a museum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DR . KADIDI ( Sits on the sofa . ) You have a big problem . ODIEMO ( Sits at the other end of the sofa . ) Tell me my problem . DR . KADIDI ( Drinks a glassful from the bottle . ) Warm tap water is millions of times safer than contaminated and supposed to be cold water from a museum piece . ( Drinks another glassful ) . That should wash down the foul your slime left in my mouth . I dread water from an earthen pot . ( NEKESA takes the two glasses and bottle to the kitchen. ) p. 22 ODIEMO The individual matters . Personally I dread ice-cold fridge water . It 's too cold . It hurts my teeth . I ca n't stand it . DR . KADIDI ( With pride . ) Subjectivity is the philosophical term that explains all you 're trying to babble out . What is yellow to you need not be yellow to me . ODIEMO That 's true . DR . KADIDI I see . Then you 're not badly off if the subjectivity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contradictions that cloud meaning in the presence of lessor mortals . ODIEMO I have never been badly off . DR . KADIDI That 's pride . It comes before a fall , remember . You have a big problem . ODIEMO That alone does not help me . Tell me my problem so that I can deal with it . DR . KADIDI Your problem is that you do n't understand the mystery surrounding the material phenomenon called change . ODIEMO Change ? DR . KADIDI Philosophers call it mutation . The current that drives reality . ODIEMO That 's no problem to me . One thing becomes another . It 's as simple as that . p. 23 DR . KADIDI Nonsense ! ODIEMO Then tell me , what 's change ? DR . KADIDI Oh . . . According to me , a philosopher . . . change ? . . . . Mutability ? . . Yes ! We 're all aware of the fact that things are always changing around us . In its present state as matter , reality is subjected to irreversible and continuous dictates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having to submit itself to the absolute power of mutation . The process is irreversible . Once something has happened it has happened . This makes it a misconception of reality to talk of repetition . You can not repeat an action . I do n't keep birthdays because I never get reborn each time . ODIEMO I do n't accept that . I am a framer . I grow crops every year the season comes round . I repeat the action annually . That 's repetition , see ? DR . KADIDI I pity you . If science ends were philosophy begins , do n't you think farming is the bottom-most rung ? ( Long pause . ) The false concept of repetition is a misconception of reality . What men like you call repetition is the doing of a completely new thing its own way in time and space once and for all . Now , the problem with many people lies in their senses , which bounce off reality unable to penetrate it , but pollute it with leftovers from past experiences . Your senses are unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-existent relationships with the past . Any accidental similarity is taken up , adulterated and termed a repetition . So , my dear farmhand , you can not do an action twice without first accepting the falsehoods involved in the concept of repetition . p. 24 ODIEMO ( Bored ) . You sound like a textbook . DR . KADIDI I want you to understand why I refused your glass of contaminated water . Man , the world is changing very fast . ( Demonstrates . ) Men are reaching for the stars . This is the age of space . My breed conquered the Milky Way , and moved away from the earthen water pot mentality to the fridge centuries ago . ODIEMO You grew up on the earthen water pot . DR . KADIDI That 's where you go wrong . ( Pause . ) Can I ask you a question ? ODIEMO Yes . DR . KADIDI You were born a baby , then grew up into an adult , did n't you ? ODIEMO That 's right . DR . KADIDI At your present age , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you as an individual ? ODIEMO You do n't expect me to answer that one . DR . KADIDI It 's a scientific question . Science is blunt . Which one of your hungers do they sate ? ( ODIEMO is quiet . ) I mean which of the two uses do you value today : suckling them like a baby , or feeling their warmth on your chest like a man ? p. 25 ODIEMO For sure you know the answer to that one . DR . KADIDI Look here big brother ; educated fellows like me do n't take things for granted . It is not scientific to do so . You must give me an answer . ODIEMO ( Reluctantly ) . If you insist , it 's my wife 's breasts on my chest . DR . KADIDI ( Clapping ) . That 's the thing . When you were an infant you valued their milk but now as an adult you value their warmth . ODIEMO I do n't understand you . DR . KADIDI Think big , think science . I 've no place for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world of giants - academic giants . You must always think big when talking to me . ODIEMO As you wish , chief . DR . KADIDI Do n't call me chief . That title belongs to leaders of savages . In America it is reserved for top firefighters and military men  --  Men and women who deploy muscles to grapple with temporary problems like wild fires and war . Good . Back to the point , falsity should not be allowed to penetrate reality , or else it 'll strike a compromise between the absolute negative and the absolute positive to give us an absolute zero existence . We must grow . It 's not intelligent to drink contaminated water just because I was unfortunately made to drink it at some shadowy time . p. 26 ODIEMO That 's not noble . I am proud of my past . DR . KADIDI Big brother , anthropology is a study not a way of life . ODIEMO Our heritage is NOT dead ! DR . KADIDI What is a heritage ? A heritage is nothing but that part of a people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the opportunity to be exposed to superior ways of life . According to the laws of matter , the inferior must give way to the superior in a confrontation . Conflagration ! The inferior becomes a museum piece , a curio of no present day importance , save to tourists and other human scavengers like historians . ODIEMO You 'll have to outgrow that mentality to become one of us . DR . KADIDI Do n't waste your words . ODIEMO There 's no reason why you refused my water . DR . KADIDI Failure to see the reason why I ca n't drink out of relics does not mean there is no reason . I 've every reason not be today 's Zinjanthropus . ODIEMO ( Rises , fed up . ) Goodnight ! DR . KADIDI ( Rising . ) Just a minute ! Be seated , I beg you . We have n't talked about home . I 've some important things to ask you . I 'd like to know how the rural folk are doing . p. 27 ODIEMO Promise to talk sense and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of honour . ODIEMO ( Sits . ) What is it you want to know about home ? DR . KADIDI Look at my house . . . . See the emptiness ? ( Pause ) This house lacks many essential items . If all were okay , the electronics would be on and you would be enjoying virtual reality in cyberspace . I would be demonstrating to you the awesome power of the Internet and how virtual reality has redefined time and space . ODIEMO I do n't see how your toys would function without power . You must ensure the power first . DR . KADIDI Do n't be silly . Are you the stranger in Jerusalem ? This is a mere blackout . Power is rationed in this country ODIEMO How much are they saving on you , with power in all the other houses in the neighbourhood ? If you do n't pay your bills you get penalised . DR . KADIDI ( After some silence , with great effort ) . Big brother , I am in a fix . The world is crushing on me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five wretched miles from here to the school , then in the evening when I come back . My car is off the road . I can not maintain it , and this exclusive area has no public transport . It 's too expensive to keep it going . They time them . It is wrong that my bathroom slippers outlast the car tyres . They are timed . I hate the calculated faults in-built during their production . You can not own anything nowadays . p. 28 ODIEMO That 's why one must have his priorities right . . DR . KADIDI I am dry . ODIEMO Do n't they pay you at the school ? DR . KADIDI I am losing my job due to age . I am supposed to retire . ( Silence ) I am in a fix . You must do something tangible tonight to salvage me . ( Silence . ) You can do many things . You can start off by giving me a small loan of say one hundred thousand shillings . I 'll refund you with interest . ODIEMO Your wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DR . KADIDI ( Hotly . ) Forget the nonsense . I 'll dictate the course of this talk . I initiated it . I am its sole author . I have the copyright ! All I want from you is a small loan . ODIEMO Where do I get that kind of money ? DR . KADIDI I know you have it . I 'll pay back every single cent with the interest . ODIEMO Money is a riddle . You can not afford to play about with it . DR . KADIDI Then make it fifty thousand . . . . Twenty thousand . . . . . Ten . . . p. 29 ODIEMO It is not easy to handle money . DR . KADIDI Please , only ten thousand . ODIEMO Money is not just figures . There 's more that matters . DR . KADIDI ( On his knees at ODIEMO 's feet , pleading ) . Then make it only five thousand . ' Am sure you can raise that even now . You 're my only hope . I am helpless . ODIEMO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money you need - even more - from this white elephant . Sell this house and move on . DR . KADIDI ( Rises . Offended . ) Huh ! I ca n't do that . I ca n't sell my home . I CAN NOT ! I WILL NOT SELL MY HOME ! All battles will be fought offshore ! ODIEMO To survive , sell this house and move off to a place you can manage . It 's as simple as that . DR . KADIDI Then what happens when important people from the States - professor friends - pay me a special visit one day - do I take them to a slum hovel ? ODIEMO Nobody is his right senses has the time and money to waste paying you a visit . DR . KADIDI ( Visibly hurt . ) You 're not qualified to say that . You do n't know any of my real friends . You do n't know how much they value me . I am not like you . ( Proudly pointing at his large picture on the wall ) . Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat that man there in anything ? ( Pause . ) What are local shillings compared to the mighty American dollar ? p. 30 ODIEMO Even a beggar 's coin is a claim to wealth . DR . KADIDI It wo n't be long before my friends begin visiting me . All sorts of international conferences take place nowadays in this city . My American friends will attend some of them . I must have a decent home where I will host them . ODIEMO Those dreams will kill you . DR . KADIDI If it 's because of the loan I 've asked you that you say that , you may as well go to hell with your sordid money . ODIEMO Do n't act the fool . When a fortress ca n't hold out , soldiers desert it . Abandon your trenches . Move out of this place to one you can manage . DR . KADIDI I have nothing to gain from a man of your intellectual limitations . ODIEMO Those are words easily pronounced to save your face . DR . KADIDI Who do you think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is has a philosophical cause . We only reach the Uncaused Cause because our minds ca n't form the concept of infinity outside a circle . ( Extending his hand to reach ODIEMO 's eyes ) . Close your eyes and try to perceive the indiscernible infinite . p. 31 ODIEMO ( Resisting ) . What 's happening to you ? DR . KADIDI Linear infinity can not be conceptualised by our minds . ODIEMO Are those your well-argued reasons for being a fool ? DR . KADIDI Ignoramus ! School dropout ! ODIEMO Call me what you like but the truth is that , it is better to be proved wrong by your fellow man than by history . History gives you no chance to make amends for your failures . DR . KADIDI That is misplaced . If you think I am listening to you , then you are sick . ( Rises ) Go to your room before I fire you from my home . You are not paying me a cent for your stay here . Back to your room , you hunger-on ! NEKESA ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . . . . DR . KADIDI ( Points at the toy and screams . ) What 's that you 're holding ? We do n't have babies in this home . Do you hear me ? ( NEKESA is quiet ) Are you out to insult me ? NEKESA I am sorry , my dear . DR . KADIDI It is always ( mimics her ) " Am sorry " . I ca n't come home during the day to find any peace . And when I decide to come back late , you stay awake just to get an opportunity to do what I do n't like . p. 32 NEKESA I was fixing the wheels . I forgot to leave it behind when I rushed in . The little ones are always destroying them . DR . KADIDI ( To ODIEMO ) . Look at her . Do you see any infants around ? She always does what I tell her not to do . ODIEMO She has the freedom to be herself . DR . KADIDI Nonsense ! ( To NEKESA with force . ) You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A normal person ca n't spend 24 hours a day fixing wheels onto toy cars , yet in all your married life you have never washed my car . For how long are you going to lead a toy-life ? ODIEMO Why do you lose your temper so quickly ? It 's not polite to talk that way to your wife . DR . KADIDI I do n't like imposters . It is very wrong for this woman to run her shameful business in this magnificent place where everything is supposed to be super . ODIEMO She helps you stay alive that way . DR . KADIDI She does NOT help me with anything . ODIEMO You 're not being honest with yourself . DR . KADIDI ( With spite ) . What do you know about honesty ? p. 33 ODIEMO I may not know much but . . . . DR . KADIDI Then shut up ! Nobody is ready to listen to an ignoramus . And remember you are here on my charity . ODIEMO Do n't forget I am your elder brother . DR . KADIDI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ODIEMO Then know that I am making a big saving staying here . DR . KADIDI What ? Are you trying to be rude ? NEKESA ( Sensing trouble and addressing ODIEMO . ) James , please go upstairs to your bedroom . It 's getting very late . DR . KADIDI You 're a terrible creature . You even have to be told when to go to bed at your age . When will you ever grow up ? ODIEMO ( Rises , to NEKESA ) . Give me that toy ; I 'll go fix it for you . DR . KADIDI Give it to him . That 's about the only problem he can solve - a toy problem . ( Ignoring him , ODIEMO takes the toy and goes back upstairs ) . DR . KADIDI ( After some silence . ) I pity that man . He cuts a terrible image . He even ca n't dress properly . He is not ashamed to move about in pyjamas . He is a total mess . He looks like an extinct animal suddenly come to live through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its faculties . p. 34 NEKESA Let 's go to bed . It 's getting very late and you 're tired . DR . KADIDI I ca n't sleep . There 's no sleep in my eyes . NEKESA I have sleeping pills . DR . KADIDI ( Almost to himself . ) I can not stand the sight of a man in pyjamas . He looks like a mammoth  --  a dodo come back to life ! NEKESA I 'll get you the pills ? DR . KADIDI ( With force ) . I know when to go to bed . Leave me alone . I must think , think and think hard . The walls are crushing all around me . The chains of junkdom have tightened their grip around my neck . . . . I am being choked . Time is running out for me . I must act now . . . I must fight back or I will be finished . ( During this speech NEKESA decides against going into the bedroom and follows ODIEMO upstairs . Moments later KADIDI stands up and blows off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polluting the air is all they do . Darkness is far much better than their dim light . ( The flat on the raised platform opens to reveal ODIEMO and NEKESA as KADIDI walks off into the kitchen . ) NEKESA I hope you do n't mind him behaving that way . p. 35 ODIEMO I mind a great deal . He is not himself . He must be made to add one to one to get two before it is too late . The sun should not set on his life before he dies . He must begin living within his means right away . His scales are already tilting in the past . It wo n't be long before he gets a knockout . NEKESA It 's shock . Everything happened so fast . He 'll adjust slowly to the new situation . ODIEMO He does n't have the time . He has no choice but to move on immediately . ( Downstairs , spotlight in hand KADIDI re-enter the dark sitting room . He switches off the torch and begins pacing about the darkness , talking to himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DR . KADIDI To hell with the Chains of Junkdom ! I will NOT abandon my ship . This is home . I will not sell it . I wo n't become a turncoat for the sake of money . I am a well-bred gentleman NOT a moral bankrupt . I belong here ! ODIEMO ( Pointing downstairs . ) Hear that ? He is not himself . NEKESA It 's the shock . I have lived with him for eighteen years now . On the whole he is a nice man . The best husband one can ever have . ODIEMO That may be so but he 's heading nowhere . ( KADIDI 's music is getting louder ) p. 36 DR . KADIDI When important American friends visit , they must find me , Professor Doctor Kadidi koMudima doing well in this place . ( ODIEMO and NEKESA exchange disturbed glances . ) NEKESA The going is a bit too rough for him . His present state calls not for condemnation but for love and understanding . He needs help . He is desperate to let off steam . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not add to it by condemning him and still claim to love him . ODIEMO I find him unbearable . NEKESA He needs to be understood . His roughness is only verbal . Above all , he is a decent man who has refused to debase himself by escaping . ODIEMO All the same , he ought to be honest with himself . He must come to terms with reality . It is very painful to see him rough you up for being a baby-minder while he knows quite well that he lives off it . You make and sell toys to feed him . You run a daycare centre to pay his bills . Instead of condemning you , he should help you set up a kindergarten in this place . You 're doing so much for him . I can not forgive his ingratitude . NEKESA It 's not long since I became a baby-sitter . The much I have done for him is nothing compared to what he has done for me over the years . p. 37 DR . KADIDI Nekesa ! Nekesa ! Where 're you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received a last minute call from the American Ambassador . ODIEMO Hear that . Is that a normal man ? NEKESA He is only tired . You 'll get used to him . He tires and goes to sleep . He wo n't hurt a fly . DR . KADIDI Hey . Where 're you ? The visitors will soon be here . American university students and their professor will be staying with us for a week . The professor was a college-mate back in the States . We were very close friends . ODIEMO This is very strange . ( They listen . ) DR . KADIDI ( Giving orders ) . Computerize your bodies . Let everyone switch on their computer buttons and work like a commando unit to get the place ready in a split second ! Apply commando tactics ! It 's an ambush , guys ! Hit back fast and hard ! Have no mercy . If it moves , it 's fair game . Crush the enemy , guys . Hey , you louts out there ! What do you think you 're doing lazying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clean it in a split second ! The visitors will need it first thing they get here . Americans like swimming like ducks . It 'll be disastrous if the pool is not ready when they get here . And you there . . . ( Exit KADIDI through the kitchen. ) p. 38 ODIEMO ( After some silence ) . It 's worse than I feared . NEKESA He has had great moments in his life . I remember he was very happy the day he got some of his money back from the States . He left a lot of wealth back in the States . It haunts him . He has had money in his life . It 's only unfortunate he was unable to get everything over here . ODIEMO Did he tell you how he made the money used to build this house ? NEKESA He liquidated some of his US assets . He had lots of assets . Real estate and the like . It is unfortunate he was unable to repatriate them . He literally left all his wealth abroad . ODIEMO Abroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make-believe world in which he hides himself . I wanted to help him when he had just come back from the States but he refused . He is hopeless . There is nothing to admire in him . He sold a one hundred-hector coffee plantation , ancestral land he inherited from our father , made loads of money and now he is bankrupt . And all he has left of that money is this house . NEKESA ( After some silence . ) He has been a good husband to me . I love him . ( An excited KADIDI re-enters the dark living room from the kitchen still giving orders , inspecting to see that all is in order. ) p. 39 DR . KADIDI Where are the maids to dust the tables , sweep the floors ! ? There are many other chores to be done ! Hey there ! Come over this way ! Hurry ! You will be time-barred . ( KADIDI re-enters the kitchen walks offstage . ) NEKESA ( As her eyes meet ODIEMO 's confused gaze . ) He 's only going through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his past life precipitate his woes . They have mutinied to point accusing fingers at the peaceful flow of his experience . He 's bankrupt flat out . He needs all the help he can get . ODIEMO Then he should own up and face the world . He makes no point talking to himself like a madman . NEKESA Nobody should condemn him for doing that . We all let off steam at one time or the other . People sing , cry or act strange when they 're either happy or sad . We all do it . DR . KADIDI ( Partly in the kitchen , excited to a point of appearing desperate . ) Only ten minutes and the visitors will be here ! Quick ! Finishing touches everyone ! Fast ! Run ! Fly ! . . . ODIEMO My brother is mad . NEKESA You do n't understand . It does him no harm . In fact , it is good for him . It helps him let off steam . In the morning you 'll meet a totally different chap . He sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like escaping from reality . He must accept the truth . NEKESA The truth has no heart . ( KADIDI is back in the sitting room . Timing by his watch . ) DR . KADIDI One minute ! . . . Fifty seconds ! . . . Forty seconds ! . . . . Thirty seconds ! Stop everybody ! Stop whatever you 're doing and act normal . Relax ! Cease-fire everybody . ( Addressing a point in the room . ) Brat ! Go clean the silverware at the back of the house ! The guests will soon be here . Americans keep their time . ( Timing ) . Twenty-five seconds ! . . . . Twenty ! . . . Fifteen . . . ODIEMO If it 's simply a question of money , I 'll make him sell this building . NEKESA That 'll not be wise at this moment . It 'll only strip him naked and worsen his plight . He needs money yes , but as a man he must also have something tangible to point at . This house secures him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's more than a superficial analysis of certain aspects of his behaviour . He is many things , as he struggles to hold a balance between the many contradictions that his life has become . You ca n't analyse him simply by looking at one or two moments on his long journey . You need the experience I have had before you can try to understand my husband . p. 41 DR . KADIDI ( Timing ) . . . Five seconds ! . . . Four ! . . . Three ! . . . Two ! . . . . One ! . . . Zero ! ( Jumping up and down , clapping his hands exited ) . There they are ! They are here ! I told you ! I told you ! I told you ! I know my people ! My Americans are the greatest thing God in his wisdom created ! They know how to keep time . Welcome them into my grand home . ODIEMO Why do n't you stop him ? NEKESA Leave him alone . He is harmless . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such madness . NEKESA It does him no harm . ODIEMO I ca n't comprehend this ! ( The flat falls back into place to cut out NEKESA and ODIEMO , as bluish lights flood the living room . KADIDI is seen welcoming his guests who are dressed in tourist gear . They enter the living room " through " the wall-line . ) DR . KADIDI Welcome . Feel at home , Professor . Professor , it 's been long since we last met . ( They embrace ) . AMERICAN PROFESSOR Is this your home ? DR . KADIDI Yes . This is where I live . Everybody feel at home . p. 42 AMERICAN PROFESSOR ( Sitting ) . It 's a grand place ! DR . KADIDI ( . Blissful . ) Welcome . Friends , the journey has been long . What would you like to have for a drink ? AMERICAN PROFESSOR Do n't disturb yourself . We 've just had some cold drinks on our way here . DR . KADIDI Okay . ( To students ) . Feel free my dear friends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorts of them books about America in that shelf . You 'll find them very interesting . ( The students invade the bookcase and the statuary ) . A STUDENT Chief . . . Got ta any books on African cultures . . . . Anything fully African ? . . . Say on anthropology ? DR . KADIDI I do n't deal in that stuff . You may look at the carvings . They 're a good illustration of the handicapped African experience that never broke into cyberspace . AMERICAN PROFESSOR Brother mine , just show us where we will put up . The lads can begin setting it up straight away . DR . KADIDI Everything is right around here . It 's all set . p. 43 AMERICAN PROFESSOR I mean , can they bring in our luggage from the van ? DR . KADIDI Oh that ! Do n't mind . I have servants . They 'll do it for you . AMERICAN PROFESSOR No , thank you . These fellows like doing their own stuff . Just show them the place . DR . KADIDI ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Osobolo ! ( Enter manservant through the wall line ) . Meet Professor Jimson Jr . We were studied together back in the States . OSOBOLO ( Shaking his hand ) . I am Osobolo . You 're welcome . AMERICAN PROFESSOR It 's a pleasure meeting you . OSOBOLO Thank you , Sir . We 're honoured by your visit . You are most welcome . Feel at home . I promise to take good care of you . I will be there to attend to all . . . DR . KADIDI ( Interrupting him . ) Good . Show our visitors to their rooms . AMERICAN PROFESSOR ( To students ) . Scouts , follow him . He 'll show you where to fix your things . DR . KADIDI ( To OSOBOLO ) . Remember you 're taking them to the VIP section in the third wing . The Professor will use the Presidential Suite . p. 44 OSOBOLO Yes Sir . ( Exit Osobolo and the students through the wall line ) . DR . KADIDI ( To PROFESSOR ) . Prof. , only my most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a most welcome honour . DR . KADIDI And my cultured servants will look after you well . So , just feel at home and relax . AMERICAN PROFESSOR Thank you . ( Silence . ) DR . KADIDI How was your journey to this place ? AMERICAN PROFESSOR It was tiring but not altogether unbearable . Some roads were nothing but potholes . ( Demonstrates ) . We went bump ! bump ! bump ! most of the way . However , the last stretch to this place was quite comfortable . DR . KADIDI ( Incensed ) . Liberty Hill is an island . AMERICAN PROFESSOR Must be . ( Looks about ) . Do you rent this place ? DR . KADIDI Oh no . I own it ! All the five acres ! I built it myself . I conceived the plan on paper , and supervised all the work . It is wholly mine - from conception to execution . Both metaphysical and spatio-temporal ownership rights over this palace belong solely to me. p. 45 AMERICAN PROFESSOR It must have cost you a fortune . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive . DR . KADIDI I know all about the mighty dollar . AMERICAN PROFESSOR It 's a grand place . I like it very much . DR . KADIDI It 's worth the millions . By the way , it 's the fruit of only one year 's work . A Ph.D . is everything in this country . AMERICAN PROFESSOR ( Surprised ) Doctor of Philosophy ? DR . KADIDI Philosophie Doctoro . ( Short laughter , points at the large wall picture of himself in cap and gown ) . Look . I HOLD A PhD . AMERICAN PROFESSOR So you made it at long last ? DR . KADIDI I had to run my course to the finish . AMERICAN PROFESSOR That 's news to me . ( Shakes his hand , embraces him ) . Congratulations Doctor of Philosophy . DR . KADIDI ( Incensed ) . Thank you . AMERICAN PROFESSOR Which University awarded you the Ph.D. ? p. 46 DR . KADIDI Eh . . . . I mean . . . . The greatest university in this republic . Remember , when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AMERICAN PROFESSOR You must be a very very happy man . Your sleepless nights have paid dividends . DR . KADIDI I would NOT have forgiven myself otherwise . I just had to make it . There 're very few opportunities outside success in the classroom . It 's not like in America where education is secondary to personality in life . America is full of opportunities . AMERICAN PROFESSOR I do n't know that much . DR . KADIDI Take my word . America has very many opportunities . If one thing fails there is always another one to be tried . You keep on trying several of them until one day you hit your target . As for here , you either make it where you are or you sink . It 's called underdevelopment  --  the inability to turn your neighbourhood into opportunity . AMERICAN PROFESSOR But you 've made it great right here . This mansion is no mean achievement . DR . KADIDI This is just the beginning . Bigger things are bound to follow . The sky is the limit for a man with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about unemployment around here . p. 47 DR . KADIDI That 's at the bottom there where all sorts of people are crowded . It 's horrible . Things are tight around their necks , but up here things are quite okay . One has the time to relax and look sideways without being choked by the chains of junkdom . AMERICAN PROFESSOR So you still use those words . DR . KADIDI They 're part of me and they mean a lot . They help me capture the hidden meaning of reality . AMERICAN PROFESSOR Fellow students never got you most times . You used to counter their crude racial profiling perfectly . DR . KADIDI Winston Churchill called it terminological inexactitude . I call it the vocalisation in vertico-linear language of linguistically evasive ideas . It fixed them . AMERICAN PROFESSOR You 're a very interesting man . DR . KADIDI Survival is the one term that sums it up . I hit back at them through such language because of their inhumanity . I had to deal with the worst kind of racism ever . . . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not saying that all white people are racists . In fact some of them like you Prof. are my best friends . However , those who habour racist attitudes can be devious . They thought I would not make it big . I wish some of them could see the chief I now am in my home , in safe academic territory . ( Short silence ) p. 48 AMERICAN PROFESSOR You got a big job I guess . DR . KADIDI My hard work in America needs something better than the professorship . AMERICAN PROFESSOR So you teach at the local university ? DR . KADIDI For lack of something better to do . AMERICAN PROFESSOR That 's very good then . DR . KADIDI Why ? AMERICAN PROFESSOR My students and I will be visiting the local universities . You 'll be a good aid when we visit your college . DR . KADIDI Pray that I 'll be around , You see , as a consultant , I have several jobs . When I am not teaching , I am out with the Ministry of Economic Planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A PhD is a burden around here . AMERICAN PROFESSOR I can see you 're still very hard working . DR . KADIDI The same way I did back in the States . AMERICAN PROFESSOR I 'd not have survived the harsh conditions under which you studied . DR . KADIDI Few people appreciate that . They seldom believe me when I tell them that my PhD was as hard to get as the fairy Golden Fleece . ( Demonstrating ) On the day I graduated , I held it up in my hand the way the Statue of Liberty holds its torch back home on Manhattan Island . ( Carried away ) . I felt the way the gallant Persues must have felt after achieving the impossible by beheading the horrible Medusa . I walked with a raised head like Joshua inspecting the crumbled walls of Jericho. p. 49 AMERICAN PROFESSOR You had every right to feel great . You began working on it just after your BA , and you spent years doing it . When you left the States you had no hope of ever getting it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit hard-pressed in the States . When I got back here I blew the skies . ( Reverently ) . Determination is the secret of success . ( Points at his picture . ) It earned me that Doctorate . AMERICAN PROFESSOR Sure . Many would have given up long before and fallen back to their BA , and become frustrated for the rest of their lives . DR . KADIDI I was not ready for that . I gave the MA a mere glance and proceeded to the real thing . I went straight from BA to PhD like any intellectual powerhouse worth his salt should . AMERICAN PROFESSOR It taxed you a lot though . You seldom slept working two jobs for your daily bread during the night , and then going to lecturers during the day . All your free time you toiled in the libraries . You deserve what you got . You paid for it in blood . DR . KADIDI On the contrary I liked it , and given the chance I would do it all over the same way . It gave me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any great brains ought to by-pass holiday resorts . p. 50 AMERICAN PROFESSOR Holiday resorts ? DR . KADIDI I mean the Masters business . A good student should head straight from the Bachelors to the real stuff . In fact had it not been for the institutional chains of junkdom , I would have headed straight for a PhD from high school . AMERICAN PROFESSOR ( Laughs . ) Do n't be funny . It 's very risky to avoid the Masters . There 's the chance of falling to hit the target the way you almost did , and then there will be no option but falling back to the Bachelors . Think of the time one would have lost . DR . KADIDI Fear of failure and that bloody blah blah nonsense are the solid custodians of junkdom . They hem society in . They make the brave lower their ideals so as to look uniform with the rest . AMERICAN PROFESSOR ( Rises . ) I 'll go check on the students . DR . KADIDI Meanwhile I will see to it that they make you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . It 's a special honour . AMERICAN PROFESSOR I will be very grateful . DR . KADIDI You loved African coffee back in the States . Today you 'll see the real thing in its rightful place . p. 51 AMERICAN PROFESSOR I 'll be back in a minute . ( Exit PROFESSOR the way the STUDENTS went . KADIDI stands up excited and begins to whistle . Full of himself he moves next to his large picture and bows reverentially to it . He then " gropes " his way through the dankness into the kitchen as ODIEMO , lamp in hand , descends the stairs into the living room . NEKESA follows closely behind . ) ODIEMO ( Alarmed ) I am going to stop him ! He 'll blow up this place with the gas cooker ! You heard him say he is going to cook ! ( KADIDI knocks down a plate rack in the kitchen . ) Hear that ? He 'll blow this place up ! DR . KADIDI ( As the plates drop . ) Grand obedience ! Grand obedience ! . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) NEKESA ( Restraining ODIEMO ) No . I 'll go and stop him myself . I am used to him . I know how to handle him . ODIEMO Be quick ! Tell him to stop the nonsense before it drives him crazy ! ( Gives her the lamp . ) Take the lamp with you . NEKESA I 've a cigarette lighter . You go back to your room . ( ODIEMO stays standing for some time then goes back upstairs . Moments later KADIDI , who has been shouting and jumping up and down , enters the living room. ) p. 52 DR . KADIDI Grand obedience ! Grand obedience ! . . . . . . ( NEKESA lights a candle . ) NEKESA My dear , I 'll help you do the cooking . DR . KADIDI ( Visibly excited ) Come and see ! Hurry ! Grand obedience ! ( Points into the kitchen ) Look at those plates ! They 're all very obedient. ! NEKESA ( Trying her best to sound normal ) . Obedient ? Is n't that remarkable ? DR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went " Pwangalia " ! ! ! NEKESA There is nothing wrong about that , my dear . DR . KADIDI Exactly ! They did n't go for the ceiling but for the floor ! It 's total obedience to the law of gravity ! What would have happened were they to experience weightlessness and float about the room as though in a space shuttle ? ( NEKESA is silent , her blank gaze fixed on KADIDI . ) That would indeed be unacceptable . Absolutely ! I 'd have run to consult NASA - the National Aeronautics and Space Administration . I 'd take world headlines in a flash . UFO hunters would be all over the place . Tourists , name them ! This place would be a place of soul searching pilgrimage . ( NEKESA lights the lighter . KADIDI dazed by the light comes to slowly as his music fades out into the distant background. ) p. 53 NEKESA ( Picks up a broken plate ) . Look at this my dear . One of the plates is broken . Look . DR . KADIDI ( Shyly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark . NEKESA ( Puts the plates away ) . I 'll help you make the cup of coffee . DR . KADIDI ( Confused . ) Cup of coffee ? Who wants a cup of coffee ? NEKESA It 's okay , my love . DR . KADIDI I was only taking a stroll . ( Switches on his torch ) I forgot to use the torch . Is n't that a great thing for one to do ? NEKESA ( After some silence . ) My dear , what 're we going to do to our house ? DR . KADIDI How do you mean ? NEKESA We should lease it out to . . . . . . . DR . KADIDI Stop ! I am NOT going to abandon my home . I can not sell my home . Come what may I will defy junkdom over this home . The Battle of Armageddon ! I will keep my head above the slime whatever the case . This is my home ! I ca n't run away ! Do you know what that means ? p. 54 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KADIDI It belongs to Dr. Kadidi and his family alone . It was built to the minutest detail according to plan for me and for my family alone . NEKESA This house is situated on a very good site . The air is quite refreshing . It has a large compound full of good trees and gardens , which can easily be given a new face . The house has three big wings and there 's a superb swimming pool , which is not being used but still , in good condition . My dear , our house is second to none around here . DR . KADIDI That 's right . It 's a grand achievement . I chose the site and supervised all the work on it . All credit goes to my ingenuity . This home is proof of my genius ! NEKESA We must make good use of this house . There are countless uses to which we can put it without necessarily having to sell it . Everybody is calling us complete fools when they see us starving with such an asset at our disposal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing permanent in their lives . They 're pitiable beings who simply want to see us fail and join them in their temporary camp . I will not let myself be called a fool by respectable people who know and value permanence . I will NOT sell the only permanent thing in my life . I , Professor Dr. Kadidi koMudima , will have to be immortalized in this home the way the pharaohs were immortalized in their pyramids . p. 55 NEKESA Are n't pyramids tourist attractions ? We can also use our house as a guesthouse . DR . KADIDI ( Hot ) . I am no fool , woman . If that was one of the causes why I set up my home then I would simply have designed it as a hotel . But I did NOT want that ; I wanted a home and that is what I built . I am not a nut . I do things according to plan . I am a strategist . Everything I do has a cause . NEKESA Whatever the so called causes , we will in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use than we are doing at present . DR . KADIDI That 's a dream that will never materialize . I 'll never live to see all that nonsense happen . Professor Dr. Kadidi may be crushed under-foot , but the base forces of junkdom never will defeat him . He 'll never submit himself to their will . NEKESA What is difference between being defeated and being crushed ? DR . KADIDI You 're not a philosopher to ask that . ( Raising ) Go to bed and leave me alone . NEKESA Darling , we have a big problem on our hands . DR . KADIDI Stop imagining things which will never happen in your lifetime . p. 56 NEKESA You have no source of income and . . . . . . DR . KADIDI I have a pension ! I will invest my gratuity in big business . NEKESA ( With restrained force . ) It is always the same talk . It was the same when you threw away thousands of shilling purchasing the wrong lottery tickets . DR . KADIDI ( Hot ) Who told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough ! I am not a fool ! DR . KADIDI That 's a false accusation ! Who said you 're a fool ? Who ? ( Silence ) . Do n't fasten the chains of junkdom around my neck any tighter than they already are . I do n't like it . I wo n't let you chain me in my own home . ( To himself away from her . ) Why all this rot - false accusations , intellectual concern and empty love ? These and many other aspects of inhuman intercourse underline your very existence even in your own home . Woman , why ca n't you give Professor Dr. Kadidi some peace of mind ? Why do you blame you failures on me ? NEKESA All I said was that we have no choice but to put this house to better use . DR . KADIDI This home belongs to Professor Dr. Kadidi koMudima . I am the only and the absolute authority here . Do you hear ? p. 57 NEKESA ( After some silence ) My dear , the truth is that we either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We must not be ashamed to do what will save us . DR . KADIDI How sad the age of martyrs is gone . Nevertheless , I will be true to the call of philosophy . I will prove to you that I am no turncoat for the sake of money . I will die defending my noble position . I am not an invalid . There 's nothing to be alarmed of . What we are going through right now is just an occasional setback , the principles are still the right ones and , therefore , the future is very bright . Victory will be ours in the long run . NEKESA Look , we have not been paying our bills . It wo n't be long before our children are sent away from school . DR . KADIDI That 's not true . I have paid all the school fees my children need for the whole year . I am a man who puts education first . I am a very responsible parent . NEKESA How about next year ? They wo n't go to school without money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not save anything . DR . KADIDI That is not a problem of my making . Education should not be intentionally kept out of the reach of the poor . ( Long reflective pause . ) I will augment my pension with money from the extra-tuition classes I will continue offering as a retired teacher . I will raise the tuition fees and , that way , I will be able to raise all the money I will need for a reasonable life-style . p. 58 NEKESA That alone wo n't see us through . With my small income , I can only buy the basic food we need . DR . KADIDI Do n't you have ears ? Have n't I said am going to raise the tuition fees ! ? Or are you of the opinion that I 've come to a dead end ? Dead but moving , is that it ? ! I can pay my way through this world ! I 'll carry my weight . Am worth my weight in gold ! NEKESA My dear , the other day you were lamenting that pupils do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KADIDI That was done according to plan . I have not been having enough time for private enterprise so I stopped them . But now that I am going to be there fulltime , I 'll advertise my services aggressively and you 'll see how they will flood the place . The business will grow by leaps and bounds . There 's no better investment in the whole market than education . I 'll put all my money and time in it and the business will grow a great deal . I will set up an academy . Students will pay by the hour . Those who ca n't afford the fees will be locked out . You will see . The highly esteemed Professor Dr. Kadidi 's Academy will be the talk of this city ; it will be the talk of the whole country as parents fall over each other to have their kids admitted to NASA Academy . NEKESA Our future if bleak ! p. 59 DR . KADIDI ( With force ) . I have got a PhD ! I have got a PhD ! I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I can not be put among failures . NEVER ! A PhD separates giants from dwarfs . Yes ! A PhD is a PhD ! NEKESA A PhD may fill a very important need but , a title before or after one 's name , may not be as important as a roof above one 's head . DR . KADIDI Where did you get that junk from ? ( KADIDI switches off the torch and there is total darkness . NEKESA lights the cigarette lighter and finds her way into the bedroom . KADIDI stays where he is . Heavy silence follows . Moments later his music is heard . The bluish lights appear as KADIDI is seen moving the chairs in the living room onto one side . When he is through he looks at his watch and begins timing as slowly the music fades out . ) DR . KADIDI ( Looking at his watch ) . . . . 15 seconds . . . 10 seconds . . . . five . . . four . . three . . . two . . . one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stroke ! ( Moves to address a point off-stage through the wall line . ) Folks , it 's time to come and feed on manna from Professor Dr. Kadidi 's head . Come and feed on the bread of the civilized . Come all ye that hunger for knowledge and have thy fill . Come imbibe knowledge on my lap . Knowledge is the only thing that proceeds from the mouth of God . ( A group of students carrying school bags " invade " the house through the wall line . ) Folks , next time you will have to move faster than that . Remember your parents pay by the second and so you must make sure that you keep time . Back to yesterday , what did I tell you about knowledge ? ( All hands shoot up . ) Everybody together . . . p. 60 STUDENTS You may deny man all the temporary needs of earth , but never deny him the eternal bread called knowledge . DR . KADIDI You are learning very fast . In this age of cyberspace you must work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the backbone of our enlightenment  --  the legacy of the information age ! STUDENT Sir , I have a question . DR . KADIDI We have n't started yet . ( Spitefully . ) I have never understood the people of this country . Why are you always in a hurry ? You 're a miserable collection of humanity . Back home in the States , lads of your age come to the classroom dressed like astronauts . All American school kids are space cadets . And their nutritious food makes them more active than you . ( Reassuring them . ) I 'll send for space badges from the States and you will all be sainted . ( Laughs at the staring students ) . Good evening all of you . STUDENTS Good evening , Sir . DR . KADIDI That 's a good start . Good manners is all that young folks like you need to unlock social locks ; and scientific knowledge , crowned with a PhD is the mark of success on us adults . ( Two girls enter ) . STOP ! You 're very late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents ' money . p. 61 GIRLS We are very sorry . DR . KADIDI I take note of your good manners . Where 've you been ? 1ST GIRL It seems everybody was late today . ( Points at fellow pupils ) . Look . Their books are still in the bags . 2ND GIRL This place does n't even look like a classroom . DR . KADIDI You 're late . Do n't seek salvation in junkdom. 1ST GIRL How can we be late when everybody else has just arrived ? DR . KADIDI I do n't subscribe to the tyranny of the masses . Two wrongs do n't add up to one good . You do n't cease being in the wrong just because the majority are in the wrong . Morality is not based on numbers but on value standards incorruptible by junkdom. 2ND GIRL Sir , we saw you come in . DR . KADIDI Do you know how much a split-second is worth in modern warfare ? It 's all the Americans need to annihilate their enemies . . . wipe the fanatics off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very sorry , sir . DR . KADIDI Now that is clever and honest . ( To the rest ) . Who will tell these two what we have already learnt ? ( No response ) . You see , you have all forgotten but I do n't blame you . I 've always told you that this country 's Education System is terrible . It stresses the fundamentals so much that the students have either to fit into the rigid pattern or drop out altogether . Back home in America the whole thing is different . Educators there brighten subject matter to fit students ' interests . ( Pause ) . Have any of you noticed anything strange . I mean anything unusual ? p. 62 GIRL I have . DR . KADIDI Where are your good manners ? When addressing your superiors always remember to use the title " Sir " . GIRL I am sorry , Sir . DR . KADIDI Good ! Always have your good manners at your fingertips . What is it you notice ? GIRL This place does not look like a classroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to plan . I want to demonstrate a fact of history . Who knows the method Aristotle used when teaching his students in the grove of Apollo ? Hands up ! ( Several hands shoot up . Points at one of the boys . ) Yes , you there . BOY P-E-R-I-P-A-T-E-T-I-C ! DR . KADIDI ( Up beat . ) That 's right . Peripatetic ! Today we are going to experience the peripatetic method . We shall see for ourselves what it looked like . During the lesson , we will walk the length of this room the way Aristotle and his students did centuries ago in the grove of Apollo . Do you get me ? CLASS Yes Sir . ( He arranges them to his satisfaction in pairs ) . DR . KADIDI ( Excited ) Okay . . . . Go ! ( He walks ahead of the class ) . Before we go any further I 'll remind you that the purpose of our current education system is to pass exams . And so , to be on the safe side , you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . Hence , for our English lesson today , we 're going to learn how one can write a good English composition . Exam compositions come in all ways and forms , but always they are based on our experience . Therefore , the topic I have chosen for illustration is none other than my stay in America . ( Turns to face the class , walks backwards . ) What heading would you give such a composition ? ( Hands rise ) . Yes , Awino. p. 63 AWINO Study life in an American University , Sir . DR . KADIDI A good attempt . Let 's hear you , Maguta . MAGUTA My years at an American University , Sir . DR . KADIDI And you Akumu , what would you write. ? AKUMU An American University ; the universal key to success , Sir . DR . KADIDI That 's better . Let 's hear you Okubi . OKUBI Getting a PhD in the United States of America , Sir . DR . KADIDI Excellent ! All your answers are good but you do n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not write a good composition on only that . When given what I call a free-range topic , always get that heading that will give you a galaxy of ideas . I would head my composition thus : " The American Experience and its Stamp of Glory on me " . That would allow me the space to talk about the White House , the flamboyant presidential elections . . . . GIRL But Sir , that is politics . . . . . DR . KADIDI ( Turns round , hotly ) Where are your good manners ? Always remember to raise your hand before you chirp out your ignorance . p. 64 GIRL Sir , you 've no eyes on the back of your head with which to see my raised hand . DR . KADIDI Will you shut up ! No questions . Class do you hear ! ? CLASS Yes , Sir . DR . KADIDI Good . . . . yes . . . . the flamboyant presidential elections , American democracy and its in-built tyranny , labour relations in a democracy , lobbies and money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vietnam on the streets of Washington , the Watergate scandal , cyberspace : the cutting edge of American imperialism . . . . there 're many important things to be included , the christening of Nelson Mandela as a terrorist by right-wing corporate America . That would give the examiner a good impression that you know your stuff . Next I would talk about student life : Study life , nostalgic student organizations and pan-Africanism . The Black Panthers ! Martin Luther King , Malcolm X , Carmichael . Lastly , to crown it all , I would talk about the grand graduation ceremony when I got the glorious PhD that has brought me all that I am today . That way I would have the whole universe of ideas at my disposal . ( Pauses and turns to walk backwards with his eyes on the class ) . Now , because it is question time , you 'll walk ahead and I 'll follow behind . ( They adjust . ) Any questions ? ( Makes a choice as hands rise ) . Yes , Awino , my daughter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KADIDI Yes . Proceed . AWINO Can such a composition fit on the amount of paper provided in the exam room ? DR . KADIDI That should not worry you at all . Your examiners have never been to the States . They will ask you things they are familiar with . You will get such stuff as writing about a day at a local market place or about monkeys in a maize field . AWINO Sir , excuse me once more . DR . KADIDI Yes . AWINO Sir , how does one write about presidential elections when politics are not allowed at school ? DR . KADIDI That junk around this place makes me lower my ideals . People who have branded me a dissident are always watching me . In the States there is a big difference between religion and politics . There are no little tin gods . You 're free to say anything that you know to be true about anything or anybody without having to risk your neck . BOY Politicians are very powerful people who should be left alone . DR . KADIDI These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nobody knows them outside their cocoons . Those of you who will work hard enough and get the golden opportunity to go abroad will see what I mean . In the States a politician is just an ordinary man to be voted in or out of office by the general public . . . . There is nothing special about politicians . p. 66 OKUBI Excuse me , Sir . DR . KADIDI Yes , my son . OKUBI Sir , do n't politicians own limousines in the States ? DR . KADIDI A Rolls Royce is no mark of individual success out there . People , ordinary men like me , own private jets and all that stuff . Great men like Professor Dr. Kadidi own the whole world . OKUBI So that 's how things are . DR . KADIDI Experience is the best teacher , my boy . I 'll give you an example . I 'll tell you what I did to a prominent African politician . This nut wanted to address the student body at my university . By then , I was the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself ) . I held that position till I left campus . And mark this , it was NOT easy to get a replacement . OKUBI Is that so ! ? DR . KADIDI I was a tough guy out there . I mobilized the students , the unemployed , hippies , drifters , street-dwellers , drug addicts and so forth to scare the politicians away because his government was against Pan-Africanism . But the police insisted on his addressing the students because he was a State Guest , and demanded to know why I was opposed . So I got up and went to the front of my army of supporters and gave my famous " No Nonsense " speech . ( KADIDI moves to address the audience . ) " No nonsense ! No nonsense ! We got ta no time to waste on idiots . There 's no addressing the students , and that 's final ! America 's got ta no joint for stupid politics ! Cops , get it into your bloody box-heads that AMERICA no be place for false **28;346;TOOLONG ' politicians with junk politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no put reason to reality . They got ta no brains at all . Look , they dump them students and veteran politicians in detention just because they talk Pan-Africa ! They no sate the hungers of Africa . They know not what good politics be . Them , cursed traitors of them people ! Them , Africa 's death warrant ! Them , moral bankrupts ! Them , do anything for the sake of money ! Idiots ! Bloody nuts ! Away from this college or there gon na be trouble and fire in this joint ! Move off cops or we gon na use your blood to paint this place red ! ( To the students . ) That 's how I used to handle those sharks . I would mobilize all those who had been denied a chance to be felt in society , and they would do a superb job on politicians I hated . p. 67 AKUMU Sir , I am sure you had it rough with the authorities if that is what you spent your time doing . DR . KADIDI Nobody ever reached us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get those downtrodden fellas in America , of all places ? DR . KADIDI There are many of them on the streets . Some parts of America are just as bad as here , or even worse than some of the worst places here . However , it is not easy to comprehend the contradiction because it is done out of choice . Crime without victims , it 's called . There is the freedom to be what you want to be . ( In full control . ) But to an intellectual like Professor Dr. Kadidi , it is calculated freedom . The funny thing is that a big democracy is more inhuman than a totalitarian state . In the latter you always point a finger at the oppressor because he 's honest enough to have come out to be seen ; the reverse is the case in the confusion that 's America . The tyrant operates behind the scenes since the system being impersonal is tyrannical by nature . The truth is very very interesting but it takes a super-head like mine to decipher the real in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come across some important people you admired ? DR . KADIDI I met the whole list of them . Malcolm X and Martin Luther King were my personal friends . Each had my direct line . I attended J. F. Kennedy 's funeral and I shook hands with many other Presidents . During the Water Gate scandal , I was with the democrats against Nixon and his Republicans . The Vietnam War was played out before my eyes . I was at the centre of many things in the States . The list is endless . p. 68 BOY I will go to America for my university studies . DR . KADIDI It 's not easy . You must work very hard to get a government scholarship . Do n't go on your own the way I did . Life is very rough if you do n't have a scholarship . BOY But Sir , you enjoyed it . Everything went well with you . DR . KADIDI My son , I am beyond compare . Race problems are terrible out there . You 'll get the shock of your life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody has to go abroad , let him be a settled fellow who has made it in life . He should be one who can absorb and counter the racists ! ( NEKESA holding the lighter comes out of the bedroom , now in her night-dress , as KADIDI walks off-stage with the students . KADIDI uses the doors but the students go through the wall line . KADIDI 's lights follow him off stage . She moves to the living room and lights the candle on the table . ) NEKESA ( Calls ) . Kadidi , my dear , come in . It 's time you went to bed . You 'll get a cold walking out at this late hour . It 's long past mid-night . You need a lot of rest , dear . DR . KADIDI ( Outside ) Am I out ? NEKESA Yes dear , you 're out . Where to are you going ? p. 69 DR . KADIDI The stars are very beautiful out here . I enjoy looking at them . Come and have a look at the stars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . NEKESA ( Who has gone outside . ) This is a spectacular sight ! The African sky is very beautiful on a dark clear night . DR . KADIDI Let us get a better view by moving over there next to that tree . NEKESA It is equally good here . DR . KADIDI Can you imagine those stars have been there from all eternity ! Eternal motion of celestial bodies was used by St. Thomas Aquinas , in the cosmological argument , to prove the existence of God , the Unmoved Mover , starting with the contingency of ideas on perception and ending with the existence of a Universal Perceiver which sustains them . NEKESA You 'll look at them tomorrow DR . KADIDI Are you sure they 'll be there tomorrow ? NEKESA Yes . They 'll all be there . They are always there . You 'll look at them tomorrow . It 's very late my dear and you need to rest .

Bring me a cupful of hemlock ! Stop ! Bring hemlock ! Yes , hemlock ! I 'll drink it willfully ! ( Pleading . ) Allow me the honour of a heroic death , like my father Socrates ! Socrates ! Bring the hemlock ! . . . . hemlock . . . . ! ( A devastated KADIDI crawls into the living room in the dim lights .

All things that matter are a labour of love not money ! p. 72 NEKESA Honey , I love you . DR . KADIDI ( Restless ) What time is it ? NEKESA It 's still too early , darling . NEKESA Shun the nonsense ! Does too early tell me what time it is ? NEKESA Darling , you have a wrist watch on . ( Looks at his watch as ODIEMO appears on the stairs , as in his first entry . ) ODIEMO What 's up this time ? NEKESA Nothing out of the ordinary . DR . KADIDI It was horrible . ( Wipes his sweating face ) ' Am sweating all over . You must come to my assistance . ODIEMO ( To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just a dream . DR . KADIDI A cosmic nightmare ! A firing squad !

Hardened soldiers , faces blacked out , some hooded . . . made in America written all over their fatigues . . . smoldering on-lookers , waving monstrous stars and stripes across a scorched globe , badly broken and oozing dark sticky blood . . . they were here , my creditors , I swear ! Yesterday they came and repossessed me . No one came to my help as I was frog matched off to be shot dead . ( Short pause . ODIEMO Steps into the living room ) A summary court sentenced me to death for being bankrupt ! As I have said now and again , brother , it 's dangerous not to have a permanent asset in one 's life .

KADIDI I 'm going to see Okaka my employer before things get out of hand . He must give me my terminal dues and a decent pension . ODIEMO ( Low tone . ) Do n't waste your time . . . DR . KADIDI ( Incensed ) Stop using bad words in the morning . My days always start on a high note of hope . NEKESA ( As KADIDI is about to step into the bedroom . ) My dear , it 's still dark . Wait till there is enough light . DR . KADIDI ( Spins round to confront her . ) I 'm not some primitive bumpkin to wait for light .

NEKESA ( Cautiously . ) My dear , you 've been working on temporary terms and . . . . DR . KADIDI ( Cutting in . ) An unbroken flow of 16 years lays a solid foolproof claim to permanence . I am pensionable ! It 's my right as a worker to be kept alive when I retire . p. 74 NEKESA Darling , you did n't sleep at all last night . You still need a lot of rest . DR . KADIDI ( Offstage . ) Do n't you know that I no longer possess a car ? To get there before sunrise , I must walk five miles to catch the earliest bus . ODIEMO I 'll drop you there in my car . DR . KADIDI Pilate , mind your own business ! Masters of convenience are an insult to nobility !

That 's the lesson the stupid Russians got out of Alaska . Sold a whole continent to the wily Americans for peanuts then turned green with envy when the hidden treasures of Alaska were revealed . The Americans rubbed the salt in by letting it be known that all along they knew what they were doing . That drove the Russians crazy to a point where they embraced a concoction of untested amateurish theories that unleashed the fires of hell that consumed their great civilization . ( During the above speech , KADIDI dash offstage into the bedroom to re-emerge adjusting his necktie , sit down to put on his shoes and be ready to leave ) . p. 75 DR . KADIDI ( Completely changed and now very friendly to NEKESA . ) Darling , lend me some money again . I keep a good record of all the money I borrow from you . I will repay every cent with interest when my plans pull through . NEKESA ( Giving him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there later in the morning . DR . KADIDI You do n't expect me to seen in public with consummate failures . NEKESA ( Giving him more money , as he begins to go . ) Darling , that is for your breakfast and lunch . ( He takes it and walks off through the main door without uttering another word . A few moments later , NEKESA calls after him . ) My dear , come back . You have n't washed yourself . DR . KADIDI ( Off stage ) Woman , stop nagging me . Leave me alone . You are NOT my keeper . NEKESA ( Calling after him ) Take care darling . Do n't jay walk . When crossing the streets always remember to use the zebra crossing and the traffic lights . ( Turns back to ODIEMO in the living room ) . He has gone without washing . He cuts a terrible sight . p. 76 ODIEMO Whatever spirit has possessed him will take care of him . NEKESA I fear for his safety on the road . He 's very desperate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's getting worse . You have to do something . ODIEMO ( Dropping into a chair ) It 's not easy to help a fake . He is too false to be understood . NEKESA That 's unfair . You must come to his help . He 's getting worse every day . For sure , you do n't want him dead . A success or a failure , he is your brother . You must help your only brother . ODIEMO There 's nothing I can do to help him . NEKESA You must come up something . ODIEMO He never appreciates my efforts . NEKESA He only needs a small push . ODIEMO ( After a thoughtful pause . ) To tell the truth , he 's not the kind of person I can help . I wo n't be able to see the fruits of my work . He is not the kind of man I can help . He is always frowning . Petty frowns are part of him . He has no ideals yet he talks of lowering his ideals . He is a gasbag . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the blue . He has no horizons in the real world . No goal posts . An honest man can not opt for a cabby hole in a phony thing called philosophy and think he has the whole universe at his disposal . He is a man I can not accommodate . His airy plans and words irritate me . Nothing tangible comes of them . p. 77 NEKESA You must come to his rescue before it 's too late . ODIEMO He 'll find his own way out . NEKESA He has nothing . He 's bankrupt and they 're even taking away his small salary . ODIEMO He should own up and ask for help himself . But he wo n't . He 's too proud . NEKESA Everybody has got his own sense of pride . ODIEMO His is a negative sense of pride . It 's not letting him do anything to avert his fatal trend . NEKESA I know professor . He is desperate to get out of the whole mess . His major problem is that he does n't know how to go about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lottery but , unfortunately for us , nothing materialised . ODIEMO ( Coldly ) A lottery 's a gamble . It 's one sure way of wasting hard-earned cash . NEKESA I tried to stop him but he overruled me . To him the lottery was his last chance . ODIEMO A lottery to be a last chance ? ! It 's a gamble . It 's never a sensible attempt to make ends meet . A man who does n't know that is no man . A real man must have tenacity and judgment ; he should not be one who depends on luck to get ahead . p. 78 NEKESA His past is to blame . He told me of his friend back in the States who got out of a fix after winning a lottery . ODIEMO What chance did he have in all the tickets sold by the organization ? NEKESA To increase his chances of winning the one million shillings annually , he went in for a lot more tickets than were necessary . He pawned our car to get the money for the tickets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaze fixed on the roof of the house . ) He 's a wayward philosopher . He has very little to apply on the streets or in the woods . I could not stop him . It 's not wise to take the risks . ODIEMO Every able man takes risks . However , what he did was NOT taking a risk but making a foolish plunge . He stooped too low . He had no stake in the lottery . It takes an utter fool to do a thing such as he did . NEKESA It 's not enough to blame him . He has to be bailed out before it 's too late . ( Silence ) You must help your only brother , my dear . He is desperately trying to hold out . He 'll do anything you propose . I know him . ODIEMO ( After a long meditative pause ) . I 'll think up something to help both of you out . I 'll be mean and rough this time around . Right now , I 've a lot of work on my hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting ready if I have to be through by mid-day . p. 79 NEKESA ( To ODIEMO a she goes upstairs ) . Please , if you can , do pass by Heart Africana Restaurant during lunch hour and talk to him over a good meal . He 'll be there . He 's always there . It 's his stamping ground . ODIEMO ( Bewildered ) . That 's a very expensive place . NEKESA He will be there . He 's always there . It 's his stamping ground . ODIEMO How does he afford it ? NEKESA He only takes a glass of hot water with a slice of lemon for his lunch . It 's given to him for free . The waiters know him . ODIEMO Okay . I 'll see . ( Looks at his watch . ) I 'm getting late . ( He goes upstairs . NEKESA re-arranges the chairs in the living room as the curtain closes . Birds begin chirping in the background as lights brighten up the forestage . It is early morning around sunrise . KADIDI , still disturbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the stage door on the right - OKAKA 's office . He knocks on the door . No response . He tries to force it open . It is securely locked . ) DR . KADIDI ( Bitter ) Junkdom ! ( He kicks and punches the door then retreats ) The nut is till rolling on his bed of roses . I do n't see why I had to come so early after all . ( Pats his chest ) . General , you 're still the strong man ! Besides , the early bird catches the worm . ( Silence . Looks at his watch . ) My goodness ! It 's only seven O'clock ! Who 's going to wait till eight-thirty ? ( Paces the place restlessly . He looks spent . He stops and looks at the door . He tries the handle . It is securely locked . Kicks it and turns away . ) Junkdom ! Everything is terrible out there . The bloody latch is too cold . ( Abruptly ) That 's the thing . Junkdom ! A cancerous civilization . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . Implosion ! Centrifugal ! ( Pause ) The fetters of junkdom force us to live borrowed lives . I a condemned man ? No ! It 's the society which is defeated . It shits defeat allover the place . It 's a vicious circle . A defeated society always gives weak excuses and not strong reasons for its actions . Being a genius , I can not find a niche in such barbaric falsehood . I went to the States a hero and came back a success story armed with a Ph.D . Philosophie Doctoro . Doctor of Philosophy , that 's me . I 've tested and proved my worth at the very top . But why all the junk around me ? Is it so terrible to be enlightened among primitive men ? ( A guilty note ) . Anyway , chief , a mere BA. with no honours in general philosophy is not much . ( On the defensive . ) That 's not true . It ca n't be . They only refused to award me the PhD because I was black . Average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peers sit in Congress and the White House farting and shitting to save mankind . Academic racism ! I was overqualified . The graduation ceremony is all formality . The cap and gown do n't make the graduate neither does the certificate . Man , it 's the course work . And I covered my course work well and wrote a length thesis . Yes , I did it . I am a hero . That 's the truth . When I left home for the States the skies , not just the roofs , where blown off . I was a village hero . I was crowned an elder of my tribe at a tender age , and the people sung my praises throughout the land . ( The bluish lights appear towards the end of the speech as KADIDI 's music is heard . Lost in the pleasure of reminiscence , he sings a cheerful tune as he performs a graceful dance . Several voices , drums and other musical instruments played in the distant background join in and accompany him . Momentum builds as colourfully attired traditional dancers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets loud , instrumental almost , carried on the dynamic rhythms of the talking drums that have now taken over and dominate . The dance is now animated . KADIDI holds his ground against the energetic dancers who challenge him to a contest of gyrating styles . Things are at a climax when OKAKA appears at a distance and stops dumbfounded . After weighing the situation for some time , he cautiously moves towards KADIDI. ) p. 80 OKAKA Dr. Kadidi , are you running mad ? What the hell are you doing dancing outside my office ? ( KADIDI stops transfixed , confused . A new awareness slowly coming over him as the dancers waft into the horizon , the music the bluish lights fade out gradually . ) Are you sick or is it some form of witchcraft you 're performing outside my office ? ( No answer . ) What spell makes you come dancing before my office so early in the morning ? DR . KADIDI ( Coming round ) . Sir . . . . . er . . . . Sorry Sir . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing here ? Why are you sing and dancing outside my office all alone ? DR . KADIDI ( Forcing a smile ) . I was only . . . I mean . . . . Sir . . . . I was just rehearsing some lines . I am preparing my pupils for the National Drama Festival . OKAKA You should do such things at school not here . DR . KADIDI I am very sorry , sir . I do n't know what made me do it here . OKAKA This is my work place not a stage for clowns . My office is meant for real-life situations . I do n't entertain theatre . p. 81 DR . KADIDI ( Pleading . ) I am really sorry , Sir . I 'll never do it again . Not here ! Never . OKAKA ( Points at the door ) . Look at what you 've been doing ! Who kicked this door ? DR . KADIDI I do n't know , Sir . OKAKA Are you sure you do n't know ? The mud on your shoes is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you need a long rest . ( Silence , they gaze at each other . Suddenly conscious of his unkempt state he begins straightening his clothes , salutes OKAKA . ) DR . KADIDI Good morning , Sir OKAKA Good morning . ( Looks at his watch ) It 's half-past seven and today is a Monday . DR . KADIDI Yes , Sir . OKAKA Are n't you going to school ? DR . KADIDI That 's why I came here so early . I wanted to see you first thing before going to school . OKAKA ( A bit soft ) . How are you getting on ? DR . KADIDI I am indispensable . p. 82 OKAKA I mean , how are you preparing for retirement at the end of the month ? DR . KADIDI It 'll be most unfortunate for the school . ( Pause . ) But , Sir , do you really intend to fire me ? OKAKA It is in your interest that you rest . You need a long rest . And I hope you will enjoy it and recover to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 'll I do without a job ? OKAKA At your age , such questions should not be asked . DR . KADIDI I need your help . That 's why I am here right now . OKAKA I ca n't see you today . I have a lot of work today . I am usually very busy on weekdays . See me on Sunday . I am usually free on Sundays . DR . KADIDI What 's that supposed to mean ? OKAKA You 're supposed to be at school and I am very busy . I ca n't see you today . DR . KADIDI ( With force ) . What 're you taking me for ! ? I am here on business . It 's most urgent . You 've to attend to me today or never ! OKAKA You 'll get nowhere making all that noise . p. 83 DR . KADIDI Believe me . I am not going anywhere before you solve my problems . OKAKA How do I solve a lifetime 's problems in one morning ? ( After some silence in which a stern-faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you want ? DR . KADIDI I want us to fix a reasonable amount . OKAKA What 're you talking about ? DR . KADIDI My pension . OKAKA You ca n't be serious . DR . KADIDI It 's my right . 16 years of unbroken service are . . . . OKAKA How many times do I have to tell you that you are NOT pensionable and . . . DR . KADIDI Stop that nonsense ! OKAKA Are you sick , or is it old age ? ( In a firm voice . ) CASUAL LABOURERS ARE NOT AND WILL NEVER BE PENSIONABLE ! DR . KADIDI Insult me . Call me hell on earth but you wo n't convince me that 16 years of uninterrupted service have not the slightest claim to permanence and pensionability in them . Is it not the length of time that gives permanence to material reality ? Tell me , is permanence not a function of time ? p. 84 OKAKA It 's not the number of years that matter here . . . it is the terms of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day I employed you . You are not pensionable . You worked on contract . Do you want to see where you signed ? I have the papers . DR . KADIDI There more to my life than your signed papers . OKAKA I expect more pious talk than that where money is involved . DR . KADIDI ( Pleading ) . My friend , I am in a fix . I have thrown all my productive years into your school . You have a moral duty to keep me going . OKAKA There 's nothing I can do to help you . DR . KADIDI You must let me keep my job . There is no alternative . OKAKA You had your time . You 'll get your send off . A small handshake . DR . KADIDI ( Not impressed ) . How much is it ? And will it be presented at a ceremony ? OKAKA You know what happens . Fellow teachers will hold a small tea party in your honour . At that party the head teacher will give you all your money in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my case ? p. 85 OKAKA Just like the others . Two months salary in one package . DR . KADIDI Character assassination ! Two months salary in one package is a disgrace . I am a Doctor of Philosophy . I deserve more than that in public . No ! You must be joking . OKAKA Wait and see . That 's your worth . This is a private school and that 's what I give to all my teachers when they go . DR . KADIDI You ca n't compare me to those fellows . I hold a Ph.D. ! ( Pause . ) Two month 's salary , my foot ! A PhD is the highest degree on this planet . OKAKA No other employer apart from me ever valued that PhD you 're so fond of . It was rejected wherever you went . It was and is valueless in itself . Had it not been for my keen business eye I 'd not have taken you on . I happened to see how to put some temporary cosmetic value onto it for purposes of marketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you for that P-H-D . DR . KADIDI Whatever you say , you exploited me . You used my PhD to attract students to your school for the last 16 years . Your advertisement placards bore the name " Professor Dr. Kadidi koMudima PhD , America " in big print . My presence in that school made parents bring their children to there believing you had the best staff in damned neighbourhood . p. 86 OKAKA There 's nothing wrong with creative enterprise . Business morality allows and promotes creativity in that field . In fact it demands it . The only thing that would have been immoral was for me not to pay you what we agreed for the use of that worthless piece of paper . DR . KADIDI You used me . You ca n't dump me like junk . I am a human being . I do n't have a useby date printed on me ! OKAKA I paid you back pound for pound or , as you would put it , dime for dime . You 've had a steady salary for the last 16 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At least I helped put food on your table . DR . KADIDI You 've been exploiting me all those years . OKAKA On top of the salary , I let you use one of the classrooms for your private lessons . Are n't you grateful for all that ? And when you retire , I 'll still allow you to use that classroom . DR . KADIDI My private tuition classes are no longer the booming business they once were . Very few parents send in their kids nowadays . In fact , I do n't have a single student ! OKAKA How 's that my problem ? DR . KADIDI Man Okaka , my friend , my excruciating financial fix needs more than two months ' salary . Primitive forces are closing in fast on me . Primitivity must not reclaim me. p. 87 OKAKA ( At a loss ) Primitivity ? DR . KADIDI ( Painfully ) . Yes . I am an American product . The chains of junkdom . ( Gestures . ) I ca n't breathe . I lost my car . Necessities like electricity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the water . I 've not been able to foot my bills . All the items I took on hire purchase last year were snatched back yesterday . I need hard cash to retrieve them . ( On his knees looking up into OKAKA 's face ) . Then there 's the food and the kids in boarding school . Help me out . Oh friend ! Be human and give me some pittance . Goodness . Help me out , my dear friend . You 're the only man I truly know in this world . I 've worked with you for a long time and we 're very close friends . OKAKA In the long run such things do n't count in this world . DR . KADIDI My home 's on fire . I do n't know what to do . I ca n't hold out against junkdom . OKAKA It 's not easy to hold out . Tears wo n't help and do n't commit suicide . Crack your head for something concrete and you 'll be able to fight your way out . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your own . Everybody 's fighting , man . Do n't give up . p. 88 DR . KADIDI Then let me keep that job , I beg you . I am ready to work for you at half pay rather than unravel and throw myself down before my wife , a beaten man . OKAKA I do n't work backwards . I need a younger man in your place . Besides there have been complaints about your health . The school will get a bad name if I do n't fire you . DR . KADIDI Oh my goodness ! Is that the end of the road for me ? ( Longish tense pause in which he sits down with outstretched legs , head downcast . Springs up moments later . ) No ! it ca n't be . I am still young and strong . I 'll take junkdom by the horns  --  dance with death and survive to tell it to the whole wide world . OKAKA Learn to live within your means . That 's the key . ( Looks at his watch ) . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Turns round as he is about to enter the office ) . I was going to forget . There 's a fully equipped bathroom at the back of this office . Take this key and go put yourself in order . ( Gives him a key from his bunch ) . Do n't walk about with unkempt hair . You have n't even washed your face ! It 's a public disgrace for a teacher at my school to move about looking like Lot fleeing the flames of Sodom . p. 89 DR . KADIDI Sir , I am very sorry . I think it is old age . OKAKA Old age or whatever , you 're still my teacher to the end of this month . I expect you to keep a certain dignified standard that reflect the status of that school . Go and wash yourself . Everything you need is in the bathroom at the back . Leave the key on the door when you go . ( He enters the office and bangs the door behind him . KADIDI , a defeated man , stays transfixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is surprised to see KADIDI still where he left him . ) OKAKA What 're you still doing here ? DR . KADIDI ( Absent , blank . ) Goodbye , Sir . OKAKA ( With force . ) You 're not going away before you wash and clean yourself . You 're still my teacher till I formerly retire and wash my hands of you at the end of this month . And even after that , I will still expect a certain dignified standard from you as a retired teacher . ( Gets him by the hand and leads the way . ) I 'll take you to the bathroom and stand by while you wash . I wo n't let you move about like a madman . ( They walk off as the flap opens . to show a table and two chairs on the raised platform . The scenery on the backdrop suggests an outdoors setting at Heart Africana Restaurant . ODIEMO , dressed in a flamboyant traditional costume , walks on stage ahead of a waiter carrying food and drinks. ) p. 90 ODIEMO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the people going in and those coming out of the hotel . ( The waiter sets up the place ) . When my brother comes , you 'll come and take his order . ( He begins eating . Moments later he sees Kadidi offstage and calls . ) Dr. Kadidi ! , over this way ! ( KADIDI comes on stage ) . DR . KADIDI How come you 're here ? I did n't expect to find you here . ODIEMO It 's long since I last visited this place . DR . KADIDI Man , Heart Africana is the restaurant in the whole country . Only men of substance come here for their meals . ODIEMO ( Showing him a seat ) Sit and have a bite . It 's long since we last had a meal together . DR . KADIDI That 's true . I do n't remember when we last shared a meal . ODIEMO This is going to be a great day . We 're going to take lunch together . DR . KADIDI ( As ODIEMO serves him a drink ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man of substance I have always known you to be . ( The waiter comes and Kadidi makes his order ) . p. 91 ODIEMO ( A short while later ) . How did it fare with your employer ? DR . KADIDI We made a great deal . ODIEMO How much are you to get ? DR . KADIDI We 'll settle that over the weekend . I had to get back to work . He requested and I agreed to see him over the weekend . . . on Sunday to be precise . ODIEMO Is that what you call a big deal ? DR . KADIDI It 's a big deal , indeed . It 's a question of pushing at a half-open door . ( Short silence . ) We were to settle everything today but the work on his hands was too much . Being a well-bred , cultivated and cultured individual , I suggested we handle the heavy calculations on Sunday . He 'll come for me from my home in his car and we will drive off to some prestigious hideout for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I also had to go to school . ODIEMO How 's school ? DR . KADIDI They ca n't afford to miss me for a day . The whole place will be in chaos . I 'm absolutely vital to the smooth running of that place . I fear for them when I retire . The whole institution will crumble to pieces . p. 92 ODIEMO They wo n't fail just because you 're away . DR . KADIDI Brother , they ca n't survive the predating force of my departure . Without order there can be no universe . I am vital to that school . I maintain order and hold it together . ( Enter waiter with KADIDI 's order . They eat on in silence ) . DR . KADIDI How did you spend your morning ? ODIEMO I did n't get all I wanted DR . KADIDI The chains of junkdom spare nobody nowadays . It 's not possible to get all that one wants in the damn place . ODIEMO All the same , I managed to get what I needed most . I intend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at exactly Seven O'clock . DR . KADIDI Do n't tell me you drive on that road at night with all those reckless drivers trying to kill each other . ODIEMO I 'd have left at noon had it not been that I wanted to talk to you . DR . KADIDI ( Pleasantly surprised . ) You ? Man , you 've done a good thing  --  a remarkable thing . I also want to talk to you . In fact , I was planning to come over to your ranch next week but fortunately you 're here , so I wo n't have to make the long journey to the countryside . p. 93 ODIEMO Still , you must make an effort to go and see the old lady . It 's time you showed her your family . She does n't know any of your family members , and that amounts to being rude to your own mother . DR . KADIDI Plans are under way to pay her a big visit she will remember for a long time to come . ODIEMO She does n't have that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How was she when you left ? ODIEMO Well , she was fine but , she can not remember your face . You must make an effort to go and see her soon . She misses you a lot . DR . KADIDI Unfortunately , Dr. Kadidi is a very busy man . Scarcity of time is my biggest problem . ODIEMO You must plan your life to set time aside for others . It always pays to do that . I 've a lot of work to do , but still I put time aside for others in my life . DR . KADIDI Man , you do n't know what it means to have a timetable in life . I am virtually a prisoner with all my time allocated to something long before hand always . There 's no free time allowed brainworkers like myself . We always have loads of very important work on our hands . Humanity stands to lose a lot , should we prioritise visiting friends and relatives . p. 94 ODIEMO Allow people into your life . You 've an obligation to establish strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A tree cut off from its roots withers and dies . You 're part of one large family . ( They eat on in silence . ) DR . KADIDI Brother , I really need your help . I 'm in a terrible financial fix . I need hard cash and , all said and done , you are the only one who can help me out . Brother Odiemo , blood is thicker than water . ( Pause ) . I made a big deal with my employer yes , but as you know , it 'll take time to pull through  --  go through the fine print and make sure I do n't sign my birthright away . ODIEMO I know you 're in a financial fix but you 're NOT going to come out being so false . You need to undergo a radical change in your life-style . . . . from your falsehoods to something realistic . . . . . something that 'll let you live within your means . You must stop being an outcast . DR . KADIDI I 'm not an outcast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and hope to raise my head in public . ODIEMO I want you to come out to the countryside and join me on my farm . Our father sent you to America to take a two years in-service course in agriculture . You are trained in tropical agriculture . I want to put you to some very good use . p. 95 DR . KADIDI ( Hurt . ) Jesus Christ ! . ODIEMO That 's a new territory at your doorstep . It 's up to you to claim it . There 's everything for you in farming . DR . KADIDI There 's no permanence in being a farmhand . ODIEMO It has proved its worth to me . I know it . I love All great men are immortalised by their work . ODIEMO Whatever do you mean by that ? DR . KADIDI Socrates , Plato , Aristotle . . . they never addressed themselves to people like you . They all live today because none of them was a farmhand . ODIEMO That madness made you sell your piece of birthright . DR . KADIDI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ODIEMO You have nothing left . What will you pass on to your children when your time comes ? DR . KADIDI I own a magnificent palace ! ODIEMO You squandered your birthright . DR . KADIDI I did not squander my birthright ! It underwent a philosophical change and progressed to higher levels of existence . I transformed it from miles of wasteland and coffee bushes to that sparkling palace you all admire . p. 96 ODIEMO That house is the embodiment of your curse . It 's stupid to starve to one 's death on a bed of gold . Liquidate it and move on with a full stomach . DR . KADIDI The problem with farm hands is that you 're too conscious of your stomachs . You 're stomach-level beings with no concepts of real value . You address yourselves to matter devoid of intrinsic value . ODIEMO What value is there in being a phony little fake ? DR . KADIDI You fool ! Ignoramus ! ODIEMO Do n't throw insults at me . I am your eldest brother . I am head of the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values . ODIEMO He is not enlightened who does not value his roots . DR . KADIDI That 's up to you . But it 's a law of life that the inferior gives way to the superior ; the primitive to the civilized . The modern world belongs to the civilized and their superior values . ODIEMO Do you remember the story grandmother used to tell us about the race between the tortoise and the hare ? DR . KADIDI ( With a sneer ) . A story ? Mere folklore ? p. 97 ODIEMO Yes . A story with a moral for your likes . DR . KADIDI Do n't be funny . Ask me anything about the cosmos and you 'll get a ready answer . I gain nothing talking about a competition that never took place . Do n't you know that wild animals can not assemble to hold a competition ? The conditioning of their nature allows them no capacity to compete and , hence , better their state . ODIEMO Do you know the story or have you forgotten it ? DR . KADIDI It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his grandmother telling the story teller ) " Once upon a time , the hare boasted to all animals in the forest that he could not be out-matched by any animal on the ground . He laughed at the slow plodding tortoise and challenged him to a race which all the animals came to witness . They took their marks , got set , and immediately the order " go " was given , the hare disappeared round a corner . . . . After covering half the journey , the hare confident that he was going to win , decided to rest under a tree and wait for the tortoise . He had fallen asleep by the time the steady tortoise passed him to reach the winning post . He woke up later with a start , made for the post at a mad speed just to get there and find the tortoise celebrating his victory " ( Back to his voice , with a sneer ) . Brother , that should satisfy you that I know my rich heritage . p. 98 ODIEMO It 's not just a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you apply its morals in your daily life . Do n't stray from your purpose , that story tells us . If you want to succeed , put that in your tea and drink it . DR . KADIDI I wo n't . A tortoise can not be my role model . Modern man looks for knowledge in outer space not in imaginary game races . You wo n't have me lower my ideals . ODIEMO I 'm shocked that you talk of lowering ideals . DR . KADIDI Do n't mess up with me , Mr. Tortoise-races-hare . ODIEMO ( After a short silence ) . Brother , you belong to the land . It was our father 's wish that you take after him as a farmer . He worked himself to the bone to send you to America to learn modern methods of farming . To his deathbed , he talked about the successful farmer he believed you would become . Why do n't you take up a life that is truly yours and fulfil our father 's wish . DR . KADIDI ( Indifferent ) . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Let the dead bury their dead " . ODIEMO ( Rises , angry ) . How dare you talk that way of our own father ? I can not tolerate such careless talk from a man of your age . That man toiled for you but you broke his heart . ( KADIDI is visibly frightened as ODIEMO towers over him ) . Unless you change from that shadow to the true man you are supposed to be , then you are doomed . It 's suicidal to lead a false life and you better be warned . p. 99 DR . KADIDI ( Cowering . ) Your anger is unjustified . I 've done nothing to annoy you so much . I was only thinking aloud . It 's allowed . ODIEMO Shut up and eat your food in silence . If I stay a minute longer , I will lose my temper and blow you up right here . ( Walking off . ) I have settled the bill . ( KADIDI eats on in silence and regards the retreating man with a confused stare long after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant background . It gradually wells to the fore , takes over completely , and then slowly begins to fade out as the bluish lights gradually envelop the whole place .

( He arranges it to his satisfaction ) . Okay . ( He poses and she takes the snapshots ) . Excellent . Those will do . I 'll send some copies to my friends in the States . They 'll see what it means and feels like to be back home in Africa . They 'll like them very much . ( As NEKESA puts away the camera ) . We will take more when we go sightseeing in the game parks . I 'll hire a professional photographer to take the snaps . p. 100 NEKESA That will be great . DR . KADIDI I 'll send them a photo of you , darling baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very many important people in the States are eager to know you , the fortunate one . They 're dying to know my fiance . ( NEKESA is quiet but bubbling with joy . ) Wait till I 'm settled in this place . Greater things will come your way . Miracles will happen right under your nose , literally . Your new life will be full of surprises . You saw my documents . There is nothing out of my reach . A PhD is all a man needs to make it through life . NEKESA That 's very true . By the way , for how long have you had the PhD ? I mean , when did you get it ? DR . KADIDI That 's another eye-raiser . Most chaps work like Kulaks all their lives trying to get it but die long before they can even be considered ready to write the thesis . But being a genius , my case was different . After my BA I got the treasured PhD after only one year , and at the tender age of 25 . NEKESA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , darling ? DR . KADIDI What else , my dear ? ( Enter young ODIEMO putting on oversize trousers , farm boots and a big straw hat . His large unbuttoned shirt hangs loosely , with sleeves roughly rolled up . On seeing KADIDI he runs to where he is , ready to embrace him. ) p. 101 ODIEMO Brother ! Are you the one ? DR . KADIDI ( Pushing him off and retreating ) Stop it ! Get away from me , madman . ODIEMO ( Still excited . ) I 've looked for you all over the place . DR . KADIDI ( Expressing shock ) . Looked for me ? Who are you ? NEKESA He said you are his brother . DR . KADIDI Stay out of this , darling . I 'll handle this imposter like a well-bred fellow . ODIEMO ( Confused ) . Imposter ? DR . KADIDI You heard me . You 're an imposter . ( To NEKESA ) . Darling , may you excuse me for a minute . Go and relax inside the hotel . This man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . ) Treat him kindly . African roots go deep . He might be your relative who you do n't remember . DR . KADIDI My relatives are not primitive imposters . They know how to dress and behave in public . ( NEKESA goes . The two stare at each other ; KADIDI is bitter , ODIEMO is confused. ) p. 102 ODIEMO Why deny me before a stranger ? DR . KADIDI ( Hot ) . Are n't you ashamed of yourself ? You 're virtually naked . ( Tidying him up ) . Ca n't you just have the mind to button up your shirt neatly . . . tuck it in like a gentleman . . . and fix the sleeves in place correctly ? You look like Jonnah fresh from the shark 's belly ! Why did n't you dress neatly if you knew you were coming to meet me ? You cut a terrible figure and you 've put me in shame . I have I spent all my time telling my fiance about your greatness and , before I can say PhD , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , make it a point to look civilized . About me everything is AD ! Always Decent ! I have no place for junkdom . ODIEMO The way you talk shocks me . ( Sits , dejected . ) I expected us to embrace after all those years between us . What 's happening , dear Lawrence ? DR . KADIDI ( Dryly ) . I am not Lawrence . ODIEMO What 's happening to you ? DR . KADIDI That 's your own problem . My official and only title is Professor Dr. Kadidi koMudima PhD , America . Never call me Lawrence again . p. 103 ODIEMO You are Lawrence ! Father named Lawrence after our grandfather . DR . KADIDI I hired a lawyer back in the States and won the case against it . It 's no longer my name . It reflects nothing about me . ODIEMO But everybody back home calls you Lawrence . On his deathbed , father blessed you by the name Lawrence . DR . KADIDI Then he did not bless me . ODIEMO I do n't believe my ears ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country ? ODIEMO My brother-in-law who works at the immigration came across your file . He told me you were deported two years ago . DR . KADIDI Deported ? And you believed such crap ? ODIEMO Yes . We looked for you but we could n't trace you . We have been looking , and just today , when I went to deliver my coffee harvest , I met someone who told me you were staying here . I came straight to this place and here we are . Why are you hiding from us ? DR . KADIDI I am not hiding . Powerful political enemies deported me . I want to get well established first then I will announce my presence . ODIEMO Do you get enough farmland here in the city ? p. 104 DR . KADIDI Do n't be funny . Do I look like a farmhand ? ODIEMO Do you look like a farmhand ? DR . KADIDI I am a PHI-LO-SO-PHER ! ODIEMO A philosopher ! ? DR . KADIDI A philosopher is one who considers things from their ultimate causes . Philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It begins where science ends . METAPHYSICS ! For example , when I look at you , I 'm able to tell that you have parents . They caused you , that is why you are . You are because they were . Simple ! ODIEMO That 's of not importance to me . DR . KADIDI It 's because you are not sophisticated . ODIEMO I did n't come looking for you this far so we could talk about things I do n't understand . Time is running out for you . You must come home , marry and settle down . DR . KADIDI I intend to marry that woman you 've just scared away when you stumbled upon us like an Australopithecus Boisei . You 're no scarecrow to move about looking like an unmade bed , used over night by an idiot suffering from itches . ODIEMO It would have been better if you had come after the two years and married . You 'll have no big children to look after you in your old age . p. 105 DR . KADIDI Such things are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern world is a fat bank account . ODIEMO All the same you have to go home . Some people think you are dead . It 's long since they last saw you . Everybody 's waiting to see you . DR . KADIDI Do they hope to milk me ? I wo n't go to see them . I 've nothing to do with farmhands . I 've nothing to do with farming . Enlightened men work with their heads , not their dirty hands . ODIEMO I do n't believe this . Father expected you to take after him . DR . KADIDI Are you still a regular churchgoer ? ODIEMO Yes - Why ? DR . KADIDI Then you are familiar with the parable of the Prodigal Son . ( ODIEMO is silent . ) When I was still doing that damned course in agriculture , that parable occurred to me in very new light . Of all the ills that befell the boy , none was as bad as the doormat of life . Farming ! Feeding swine was the worst of them . Christ himself applauds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pigs . Seeing this , I went for philosophy and made it up to a PhD . ODIEMO You should not have done that . p. 106 DR . KADIDI I am a Doctor of Philosophy ! ODIEMO You were supposed to take after our father . DR . KADIDI PhD ! Philosophie Doctoro ! ODIEMO He died last year praying you 'd be a bigger more accomplished farmer than he was . By the way , you have to go and pray by his graveside . DR . KADIDI Death is no mystery to philosophers . The question of one and many in material reality can be explained simply . Death is a mere transition from one form of existence to another . ODIEMO Do n't be silly ! Our father was not just a form of existence to be explained away . He was a man full of life . He led a very successful life . He could sing and dance and enjoy life like nobody else I have seen . He was so orderly that when he died he left a lot of wealth behind to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Where 's the wealth ? ODIEMO According to customary law , the elders divided it between us his two sons . DR . KADIDI You 're now beginning to talk sense . How much did I get ? ODIEMO There is the coffee land and the dairy animals . But first you should go and pay your last respects to him by his graveside . He must feel your presence to know that you 're back safe and sound . p. 107 DR . KADIDI Spirits are not corporeal to be limited by time and space . ( Rises ) . I will observe a minute 's silence in his honour right here . ( Bows his head in silence ) . ODIEMO ( As KADIDI sits ) . That 's welcome but custom demands that you go to the graveside . Before you left for America our clan elders admitted you into their ranks to protect you from ill fortune . And as a legally crowned elder , there are certain rites you have got to go and perform by father 's graveside . DR . KADIDI Drop the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wealthy white man back in the States . ODIEMO That 's not possible ? DR . KADIDI I sold the regalia ODIEMO ( Shocked ) . No you did n't ! DR . KADIDI Did you want me to starve to death ? In reality the inferior gives way to the superior . It 's a law of matter . I needed money for my studies , so the crown of Primitivity had to give way to grand sparkling crown of enlightenment and civilization . ODIEMO Then you are not worth much . p. 108 DR . KADIDI Worth is a function of permanence . And permanence is only found in spiritual reality . Matter , because it has form , is always changing its state . It can not serve as a value standard . ODIEMO I do n't get you DR . KADIDI Take our own father for example , though he was a great farmer and died only the other day , one ca n't trace any marks left behind by his big hoe . . . But great men of substance like Thales , Socrates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . they are all immortalised in their philosophical works . Today they live on among us . As for our father and his ilk , it is a simple question of out of breath out of existence . If nobody carries on tilling that land it will all be overgrown with bush . The jungle will reclaim it . Men who peck the ground like hens have nothing permanent in their lives . ODIEMO That 's the most stupid thing I have ever heard . DR . KADIDI What does an ignoramus like you know ? ODIEMO Do n't call me an ignoramus . You must show me the respect due to me as your elder brother . DR . KADIDI I am not a member of that world . ODIEMO It is our custom that when a father dies in a home , the eldest son becomes the undisputed authority . p. 109 DR . KADIDI Were you asleep the day I shattered the whole code of customs in this land ? Why was I made an elder long before you when I was going to the States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was buried . And for sure , you are no better than his grave - a manure heap . ODIEMO You imbecile ! ( He grabs him by the neck and forces him to his feet . ) Our father 's grave is not a simple heap of manure ! I will beat you up you up if ever you utter such insults in my presence . DR . KADIDI ( Shaken but putting on a bold face ) . My disciplines condemn the use of all forms of violence however justified the cause may be . ODIEMO I do n't give a damn ! ( Lets go but stands threateningly over him ) . I 'll not hesitate to give you a good thrashing . DR . KADIDI ( Pleading on his knees . ) I accept defeat . Do n't harm me , I beg you . ( Enter the waiter . He does n't see ODIEMO . He regards the kneeling KADIDI in disbelieve . ) Do n't use any violence on me I beg you . I am a Doctor of Philosophy who developed only the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it comes to muscles . ( As KADIDI comes to his surroundings , daylight reappears slowly as the waiter reaches out to help him . Simultaneously , ODIEMO recedes , slow motion , in the opposite direction and out of sight , fading with the music and the bluish lights. ) p. 110 WAITER ( Confused ) What 's happening , Sir ? Who are you talking to ? Are you talking to me ? I do n't understand you . Are you sick ? You look sick . How can I help ? Do I call a doctor ? ( Silence . ) Sir , why is your food half-eaten ? DR . KADIDI ( Coming to as the waiter helps him onto his feet ) . Why 're you disturbing me ? Staring about ? What are you looking at ? I have neither touristic nor anthropological value . Leave me in peace ! WAITER In case you 're in need , I can help you out . I mean it , Sir . DR . KADIDI ( Aggressively to the waiter . ) I do n't take kindly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage . The waiter stares in the direction for sometime before going back to his work as the flat is closed . Simultaneously , lights come up on ODIEMO as he enters the living room . NEKESA carrying a small child ushers him in ) . NEKESA Welcome . You have come back much earlier than I expected . Did n't you pass by Heart Africana ? ODIEMO We had lunch together NEKESA That was very kind of you . Where is he . p. 111 ODIEMO I left him finishing his lunch NEKESA Could n't you wait for him ? It would have been lovely to see the two of you walk in here like brothers , hand in hand . ODIEMO I had to leave him . We were heading for a quarrel . I have a bad temper that should never be let lose . NEKESA At times he is too self-centred . I do n't blame you , my dear . ODIEMO The man I knew died in America . NEKESA He needs your help . He 'll make it . ODIEMO I do n't know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his senses soon , I 'll leave him alone and get on with my life . NEKESA Do n't give up . He 's such a loving man when he has money that you should do everything possible to help him out . ODIEMO ( Stroking the child ) . This is a nice kid you 've got here . What 's his name ? NEKESA Wasswa Nambegele . Seven others are at the back of the house with my partner . I find a lot of fulfillment looking after these little ones . ODIEMO This business you have started is very good . It used to be very bad when you sat here doing nothing all day , being a professors wife . I hated the sight of your slouching figure . p. 112 NEKESA Personally I like working with my hands . It 's my husband who stopped me . I 'd be very far by now , had I stayed on at the Nursing Home . ( Almost to herself ) . Had I foreseen this I would NOT have given up my job . ODIEMO It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NEKESA I wish somebody had told me earlier that he sold his share of land to build this house ! Why did I take in everything he said ! ? ODIEMO The gasbag is smart when it comes to flaunting his charms . He only failed to run me through because , like the Apostle Thomas , I believe only in what I can see and touch . NEKESA ( Looking him straight in the face . ) Have you thought up something to help us ? ODIEMO My son is doing quite well in his private practice . I could ask him to take you on as a nurse . But will you be willing to move off to the countryside ? NEKESA I have no objection to that but , as you know , my husband will have to give his approval before I move . I do n't want to hurt him . ODIEMO He has no choice , I am afraid . And then , a mansion such as this one is quite an asset if only it can be put to more economic uses . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you can rent it out . It 's a valuable piece of real estate . p. 113 NEKESA I do n't know what we can do to make him accept that . ODIEMO He has no alternative . It 's do or die ! He will have an airtight confrontation with the truth when he comes back this evening . Stripped naked , he 'll have to face the stark truth for once in his life . I know how I 'll do it . He wo n't escape this time . I wo n't give him the chance to deceive himself any further . NEKESA Poor Kadidi ! ODIEMO Show him no mercy when I go for him . Do n't identify with him in any way . If you ca n't be indifferent in his presence , then you 'll have to get out . He should be alone when I face him . That way , I 'll be able to shatter the shadow and , hopefully , reach the man in him . That 's the only way to crack him . NEKESA He 's very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ODIEMO I promise nothing . The future 's unpredictable . Now , get me all the unpaid bills in this house . NEKESA He locks them securely away in a box and takes the keys with him wherever he goes . ODIEMO Show it to me . I 'll force it open . ( They enter the adjoining rooms . Meanwhile KADIDI , an exhausted man , approaches the house slowly . He carries a new tin of paint and a brush in his tired hands . He stops now and then . ODIEMO and NEKESA re-enter the living room . ODIEMO carries a large envelope ) . p. 114 DR . KADIDI Big brother ! It 's great you 're still around . How are you doing ? ODIEMO It 's me to ask you how you are . DR . KADIDI ( Considers NEKESA with terror in his eyes ) . What 're you up to ? You 're getting on everybody 's nerves . ( To ODIEMO . ) Look at that embryonic being she 's carrying . This whole place is infested with parentless babies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like them . DR . KADIDI It 's because you still hang primitively about the beginning of life unaware of Darwin and evolution . ( To NEKESA ) Get that imp outta here before I crush it underfoot ! And let it be the last time you bring miserable rejects into my home . Do n't you know they are the very embodiment of the chains of junkdom , witnessing to our defeated society 's irresponsible and failed institutions ? ( He screams inaudible curses after her as she goes out . ) ODIEMO That 's not how to treat an industrious wife . DR . KADIDI ( Putting the tin of paint and the brush onto a table . ) She is everything but industrious . With all those imps around , it 's unbearable . The bastards paint the whole place red , reminding me of failure . p. 115 ODIEMO You talk as though you never had children of your own . DR . KADIDI I 've two smart ones aged ten and twelve years , and I take good care of them . They 're both studying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to soil people 's homes . I am very responsible . ODIEMO Why is it that you do n't appreciate your wife 's initiative ? It 's by looking after those kids that she feeds you . You should help and encourage her . DR . KADIDI I have done all I can to help her out . She has all the space she needs at the back of the house , but she refuses to operate behind the scenes . Her parade mentality is a sad pointer . And at times , she 's too good to be real . ODIEMO How too good to be real ? DR . KADIDI I do n't understand her . ODIEMO Are you saying you even do n't know how to be married ? DR . KADIDI I 'll give you an example to illustrate what I mean . You see , there was a time Kadidi Jr . was admitted into a hospital for several days . My wife went to stay with him leaving me all to myself in this mansion . Feeling lonely one evening , I went hunting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I could say PhD , my wife burst into the bedroom and caught us right in the act ! p. 116 ODIEMO She must have made a painful scene in the bedroom . DR . KADIDI ( Mimics a bitter NEKESA ) " You men are terrible ! Is this what you do in my absence ? Ca n't you even feel for me and the sick child ? I never expected you to be such a soulless phony ! Phooey ! " That 's all she said then turned round and walked out . Stopping at the bedroom door she added , " Our son is to be operated upon tomorrow . The doctor would like to see you very early in the morning . Goodnight , love ! " She then walked out to the car , and drove back to the hospital . ODIEMO What ! ? She did that ? DR . KADIDI That word " LOVE " , said with much affection and confidence , hit me like a high velocity bullet . I threw the pick-up out and have never looked at another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) When I went to the hospital the next day , I expected to meet a jackal armed with a divorce threat . But man , she dealt me a worse blow . I was not prepared for her silence . SILENCE ! She did not ask me anything . She did not and she has never done it . She delivered a grave blow right at the seat of my conscience . ODIEMO She ought to have exorcised you in some tangible way at the very least . DR . KADIDI I wish she had met me with slaps and blows . She has kept me guessing all the time . I do n't understand her . I have n't the slightest idea what she thinks of me . Where does she place me on the scales ? I ca n't explain her apparent aloofness and indifference . p. 117 ODIEMO Weak men may occasionally fall . But it 's wrong for a wife to encourage it by being indifferent . It 's her duty to physically blow your excesses up . Your wife did a bad thing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have dealt with you physically . DR . KADIDI She hit my spirit and forever stalks my guilty conscience . I 'm at a loss when it comes to relating to her as my wife . I can not tell whether she loves or simply tolerates me . How many times has she delivered those blows of silence ? It 's a nightmare having to live with such an agent of junkdom . ODIEMO If that 's what she does , then she has lost many golden opportunities to hatch you into the stark realities of this life . Left to yourself , people like you can not tell your left hand from the right . DR . KADIDI I do n't like those words . I am not useless . ODIEMO At times the duty falls on the wife to keep her husband aware of the sun that burns in the sky daily ; of winds that carry rain on one wing and drought on the other ; of green trees and dry woods ; of valleys and hills ; singing birds in the air and the slippery fishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nekesa can not teach me what lies beyond those material horizons you have just defined . Like you , she 's a prisoner of the spatio-temporal world . You fellows have no idea there is a perfect immaterial world in blissful existence . Spirits do n't eat each other . p. 118 ODIEMO Nonsense ! A man must know what 's basic to life first , before anything else can follow . DR . KADIDI There you go again . When will you ever get rid of that farmerholic approach to life ? Has it not occurred to you that you 're in a totally different environment in my home ? ODIEMO There 's only one environment that matters in the world . It 's always man versus the rest of the world manifested in different ways . It 's that way all over the world . DR . KADIDI There 's nothing to substantiate your theory . How can you , a man who has never travelled outside a radius of fifty miles from his birthplace , talk of the whole world ? You know absolutely nothing about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of reality . I do n't have to go to America to know what happens there . DR . KADIDI Of course Major , the best scientific laws are those founded on ignorance and hearsay . Maybe you are right . You can get there through cyberspace . ODIEMO I repeat , I do n't have to go to America to know what happens there . A mere glance at you is enough to tell me that , like ours , the American environment sets the individual against the rest of the world . Otherwise , why are you the failure you are ? p. 119 DR . KADIDI ( Exploding ) Goddamit ! I am NOT a failure you school-dropout ! Living fossil ! I did my studies from the start through university and got a PhD ! ( Points at the large wall picture of himself in cap and gown . ) Can you challenge that man in anything ? ODIEMO What 's a PhD when it ca n't feed you ? DR . KADIDI Are you boasting because I asked you to give me a small loan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stomach-centred brat ! Do n't you think there is only the stomach to be attended to in life ! ODIEMO It is the check-point ; the driving force underlying all transactions carried out by the living , however far removed or remote they may appear to the eye . In whatever we do , we seek to sate our hungers . It 's only fakes like you , lacking in substance , who pretend to think otherwise . DR . KADIDI Men like you who do n't care about others have no noble ideals . All you care for are your bottomless bellies . ODIEMO I 've been thinking about your state with a lot of consideration . DR . KADIDI Why have n't you come up with something concrete to help me ? ODIEMO ( Coldly ) . I have something cold and hard . p. 120 DR . KADIDI Attach a number . How much is it ? ODIEMO The remaining part of your active life . DR . KADIDI Are you sure ? ODIEMO It 's the only way out for you . A new life awaits you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to the countryside to join me . DR . KADIDI I ca n't go back to the land . I wo n't live to see the day I will be forced to leave my home for the wilderness . ODIEMO Those are mere words Tonight will be your last day here . DR . KADIDI ( Kadidi lies flat on the floor ) I AM NOT MOVING OUT OF MY HOME ! ODIEMO Once in the countryside we will form a partnership . You 'll get your initial share of the money from the rent on this house . DR . KADIDI ( Rises ) What 're you talking about ? ODIEMO Steel yourself for a bright future as a farmer . DR . KADIDI THERE IS NO PERMANENCE IN FARMING ODIEMO There 's no madness either . DR . KADIDI I am not going to fall back on what I abandoned way back when I begun seeing things the civilized way . p. 121 ODIEMO Those are words easily pronounced . DR . KADIDI Mind you own business . ODIEMO You are my business . DR . KADIDI I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come out to face the stark reality . It 's never too late to do that . DR . KADIDI ( After a short silence ; rudely ) Cicero go on . Sophist , vomit out all the non-truth mantras in you . Ignoramus ! Beelzebub ! ODIEMO ( Bangs the table ) . For heaven 's sake , pay better attention to my words than a clown would . Why the hell are you the fool ? Ca n't you see the storm clouds gathering over your head ? DR . KADIDI It 's you who does n't see it . Why are you so indifferent ? ODIEMO I 'm trying to do everything possible to help you . DR . KADIDI Words ! . . . . Words ! . . . . What the hell are you taking me for ? ODIEMO A confused brother who needs my guidance through shock treatment . DR . KADIDI It 's you who is confused , not me . I am no fool to leave this place already on the map of the world , and go eke out a shadowy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 122 ODIEMO You 're going to move all the same . DR . KADIDI Not to Hades . I am king of this place . ( Points at the tin of paint and brush . ) I have already bought the paint and brush . I am going to write , and in big print , on each and every wall in this house that I own this house . With the words : " THIS HOME BELONGS TO PROFESSOR DR . KADIDI koMUDIMA PhD , AMERICA " printed all over the house I 'll be safe . Nobody will dare move in here thereafter . That 's my last-ditch position , weapon of last resort . I see light at the end of the tunnel . ODIEMO Nonsense ! You 're a crashed man who must vacate this place now . DR . KADIDI I may be crashed but I am NOT defeated . I will never be defeated . ODIEMO That sounds like a line from a book of fiction and not a summary of a true-life experience . In real life the difference between being crashed and being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite . ) What else do you know ? ODIEMO I know that you have only one opportunity left - take it or die . DR . KADIDI ( Almost to himself ) . The truth that the capacity of the listener should match the ability of the speaker can not be better illustrated than when I talk to you . You comprehend absolutely nothing at all . p. 123 ODIEMO Those empty words you 're so fond of are the curse that has denied you your birthright . Has your ability to understand petered out ? Why 're you as obstinate like an ass which has lost the use of its five senses ? You must be mad ! DR . KADIDI The law of opposites is my salvation . One does n't have to lose his head when a madman calls him mad . Negative followed by negative equals positive . A madman calls you mad it means you are normal . That is what negation of negation means ! ODIEMO Listen or I fill that emptiness in you right now with blows . DR . KADIDI What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discourse ? ODIEMO I 'll begin hitting you if you do n't pay maximum attention to what I 'm telling you . DR . KADIDI My noble disciplines condemn physical confrontation . ODIEMO I do n't give a damn whatsoever for the fake disciplines you boast of . You 're going to pack and go back to where you belong right away , do you hear me ! ? DR . KADIDI I belong right here among the civilized . This mansion is a historical monument . It 's a family right . I am not going to let it be take prisoner by the chains of junkdom just because an undefined entity of transient matter called Odiemo so wishes . ( Odiemo does not respond . ) The dice has long been cast . One must be ready to make the necessary sacrifice to nurture noble ambitions . I am ready to sacrifice myself if that will help promote the liberating cause of philosophy . No noble cause succeeds without real sacrifice . Have you never heard it said that the life of a great idea is in the blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DR . KADIDI Look here brother . You are beyond redemption . Just enjoy my hospitality and then , both as a mark of good manners and as a show of gratitude , leave my home with a handshake and a smile . ODIEMO Life 's more than a handshake and a smile . You 're no better than a corpse . DR . KADIDI I 'm no zombie , you rustic . ODIEMO A bankrupt man is as good as a zombie . DR . KADIDI Fossil ! There are greater values in life than money . ODIEMO A man life is a struggle to surmount his appetites . That makes him set reasonable goals achievable through sacrifice and determination yes , he must always carry his own weight . . . . If you ca n't add up to that then you have the wrong appetites . DR . KADIDI I am a man of noble spirit , not a boiling pot of primeval appetites . ODIEMO A failure is one consumed by his own appetites , like you . DR . KADIDI Bloody sadist ! Weeping philosopher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure ! ODIEMO I am NOT ready to feed any adult who is not disabled . p. 125 DR . KADIDI You do n't have to remind me that you 're selfish . I do n't count on you . Goliath ! You 're too selfish . ODIEMO I am as selfish as a gold mine . It does n't dish out its treasure to miners free of charge . At times , lives are lost . The mining is hard , but when the miners ' determination pushes them on , the mine may collapse in a desperate attempt to hold its wealth back . Then their lives are lost . Life is a question of paying a price too dear even for gold . Our lives on this earth are like that . DR . KADIDI I 've never been so close to an animal . ODIEMO It 's because you 've decided to be blind . Look out ! You 're driving your small car down the wrong lane . You 're heading for a head-on collision with that lorry speeding madly towards you ! Look out ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DR . KADIDI Stop using horrible words . Ca n't you choose your words ? I need some peace of mind . ODIEMO When you swim against the current you risk your life . Whether you 're a statesman or a beggar , society has no niche for rebels who do n't know their camp . Keep to your camp and do n't be a dissident . DR . KADIDI Is a dissident anyone who does n't go your selfish way ? p. 126 ODIEMO That 's right . ( Enter Nekesa cautiously ) DR . KADIDI ( Almost to himself ) . Uniqueness is unjustly called abnormality by the incurably ignorant . ODIEMO Nobody tolerates it , you tomb . DR . KADIDI Stop insulting me . I am innocent . ODIEMO No cow is innocent in a gathering of butchers . ( Shows him the envelope for the first time . ) Look at this . Does it sum up your innocence ? DR . KADIDI ( To NEKESA : ) JUDAS ! Why did you give him that envelope ? Mutt ! ( He threatens to charge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) ODIEMO ( Restraining him . ) You 're not going to touch her . DR . KADIDI ( Struggling to break loose . ) Today is the D-Day ! Judas ! I 'll show you my true colours . I 'm NOT a pauper . I will tear you to pieces for calling me bankrupt . NEKESA ( Partly behind the door ) . I 'm very sorry , my dear . I had to show them to him . He is our only hope . p. 127 ODIEMO ( To NEKESA . ) Shut up ! If you ca n't be quiet get lost . ( They struggle heavily . Gradually he overcomes KADIDI and forces him sit onto the table . ) Sit here and be quiet ! We 've to go through these bills together ! I want to know how much you owe society . DR . KADIDI Nekesa , I will never forgive you for this betrayal . I will never ! Never ! Not for as long as I live . ODIEMO I 'll smash you if you do n't pay due attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beg you , handle me with the respect due an accomplished Doctor of Philosophy . I am a decent human being . ODIEMO Why do n't you want to move out of this hell to a better place . DR . KADIDI Moving out of this home was not one of its philosophical causes . I built it myself according to plan . It 's my home ! Come what may , I will never desert it ! Upon my death , nature will pass it over to Kadidi Jr . This is my only rightful home ! ODIEMO This is a prison not a home . DR . KADIDI IT IS MY HOME ! You can not change reality ! ODIEMO It 's very dangerous to be an intruder . Society has no niche for gatecrashers of your type . Staying here you are all failure . p. 128 DR . KADIDI A Doctor of Philosophy can not be a failure . Never ! ODIEMO ( Tests the phone ) . Why is it not functioning ? ( Moves to the switches . ) And these ? Why is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . ) Where is your car ? Are they rationing petrol , or has someone stolen the roads ? DR . KADIDI ( Pleading ) . Brother , ca n't you just take it from me that I am innocent ? Stop lamming me with junk . ODIEMO ( Pulls out the bills . ) Look at the burden you have in this envelope . How are you going to manage it without an income ? A good income ! How ? DR . KADIDI ( Abruptly and with pain ) STOP ! ODIEMO You pawned your car , did n't you ? DR . KADIDI ( Mournfully ) Nekesa , what 's this darling ? Have you too , mutinied and joined the indecent forces of junkdom against me ? ( Silence ) . That silence has been my torture in this home . What am I to you ? ODIEMO She 's a very loving wife . She does not want to see you killed living on credit . p. 129 DR . KADIDI Brother , I 've had enough of your torture . ODIEMO ( Feeling through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've the added burden of bringing up a family in your old age . DR . KADIDI ( Painfully ) . Please stop lamming me . You 've already taken away the little that kept me together against the chains of Junkdom . I am defenceless now . Please stop what you 're doing and set me free . ODIEMO You 've made your bed and you must lie on it . ( Pulls out a letter , looks through it , shocked ) What 's this ? You have even mortgaged this house ! ( Beaten ) So you even do n't own this place . ( A confusion of music and strange noises are heard backstage . A red glow envelops everything on stage as ODIEMO throws the bills at KADIDI , who freezes . NEKESA and ODIEMO move a few steps towards each other and freeze gazing at each other . A dirge , played on the flute , is heard in the distant background coming slowly to the fore . The red glow disappears and there is total darkness onstage . ) CURTAINS ( END OF PLAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
