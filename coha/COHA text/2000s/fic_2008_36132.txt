chapter <p> One <p> My memory of her has grown on my soul <p> like ivy climbing a home until it begins to tear and <p> tug at the very brick and mortar itself . <p> ERIC WELCH 'S DIARY <p> DECEMBER 25 , 2006 <p> It 's Christmas day . There is Christmas music playing from the radio in the other room . Mitch Miller 's " Santa Claus Is Coming to Town . " It 's a little late , I think ; Santa 's come and gone , as have our children and grandchildren . They 've left an impressive mess in their wake , but I do n't care . As I get older I 've come to treasure any evidence of family . Snow is falling outside and all is peaceful and still . In such moments it is possible to believe that the world could still be good . <p> Something profound happened to me today . It started innocently enough  --  as most life-changing experiences do  --  with a request from my grandchildren to read them a Christ-mas story , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fan of the tale , but , like most grandparents , I 'm not one to deny my grandchildren . As I read to them , something happened to me ; by the end of the story I was crying . Four-year-old Ebony Brooke tried to console me . " It 's okay , Grandpa , " she said . " It 's just a story . " <p> It 's not just a story , there really was a little match girl and she changed my life in ways I 'm still trying to understand . Even the grandchildren sitting before me would n't be here if it was n't for her . As important as she is to me , I 've never shared her story . It 's finally time that I did . <p> My memory , like my eyesight , has waned with age and I pray I can get the story right . Still , there are things that become clearer to me as I grow older . This much I know : too many things were kept secret in those days . Things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have . <p> Who was she ? She was my first love . My first kiss . She was a little match girl who could see the future in the flame of a candle . She was a runaway who taught me more about life than anyone has before or since . And when she was gone my innocence left with her . <p> There is pain in bringing out these memories . I suppose I do n't really know why I feel compelled to write at this time , only that I am . Maybe I want those closest to me to finally know what has driven me for all these years . Why , every Christmas , I occasionally slip away into my thoughts to someplace else . Or maybe it 's just that I still love her and wonder , after all this time , if I can still find grace . <p> Copyright 2008 by Richard Paul Evans <br> Continues ...
