On a gloomy March afternoon , sitting in the same high school classroom she 'd been sitting in for thirteen years , gritting her teeth as she told her significant other for the seventy-second time since they 'd met that she 'd be home at six because it was Wednesday and she was always home at six on Wednesdays , Quinn McKenzie lifted her eyes from the watercolor assignments on the desk in front of her and met her destiny . Her destiny was a small black dog with desperate eyes , so she missed the significance at first . She did n't miss anything else . The dog that her favorite art student held out to her was the canine equivalent of an exposed nerve : wiry black body , skinny white legs , narrow black head , all of it held together with so much tension that the poor baby shuddered with it . It looked cold and scared and hungry and anxious as it struggled in Thea 's arms , and Quinn 's heart broke . No animal should ever look like that . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward Thea while Bill groaned and said , " Not another one . " " I found it in the parking lot . " Thea put the dog down on the floor in front of Quinn . " I knew you 'd know what to do . " " Come on , baby . " Quinn crouched in front of it , not too near , not too far , and patted the floor . " Come here , sweetie . Do n't be scared . It 's all right now . I 'll take care of you . " The dog trembled even harder , jerking its head from side to side . Then it made a dash for the nearest door , which , unfortunately for it , was the storeroom . " Well , that 'll make it easier to trap and catch , " Bill said , his tone as cheerful and sure as always . It was always a beautiful day in the neighborhood for Bill , a man who 'd taken the Tibbett High football team to five consecutive championships and the baseball team to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by never considering the possibility of defeat . " Know where you want to be and go there , " he 'd tell the boys , and they would . Quinn decided she wanted to be someplace else , with a pizza , but she had to comfort this dog and get rid of Bill before she could go there . She crawled on her hands and knees to the door , trying to look nonthreatening . " Now look , dogs like me , " she said in her best come-to-mama voice as the dog cowered against a carton of oaktag at the back of the narrow storeroom . " You 're missing a good deal here . Really , I 'm famous for this . Come on . " She moved a little closer , still on her hands and knees , and the dog peeled its eyes back . " I suppose you had to do this , " Bill said to Thea good-naturedly , and Quinn felt equally annoyed with him and guilty about misleading him . " No more dogs , " he 'd said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have to save them all . " And she 'd nodded at him to acknowledge that she 'd heard him , and he 'd taken it as agreement , and she 'd let him take it that way because it was easier , no point in creating a problem she 'd just have to turn around and fix . And now here she was , cheating on him with a mixed breed . She looked into the dog 's eyes again . It 's going to be all right . Ignore what the big blond guy says . The dog relaxed away from the box a little and looked at her with caution instead of terror in its worried little eyes . Progress . If she had another ten hours and a ham sandwich , it might even come to her on its own . " You 're not bringing it home with you , right ? " Bill loomed behind her , cutting off the afternoon light that came dimly through the wall of windows and casting a shadow over her so that the dog shrank back again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fault that he was huge , but he could at least notice that he cast considerable shade wherever he went . " Because we 're not allowed to have dogs in our apartment . " Bill 's voice was patient as he went on , a teacher 's voice , telling her what she already knew , guiding her to form the correct conclusion . My conclusion is that you 're patronizing me . " Somebody has to rescue strays and find them homes , " Quinn said without looking behind her . " Exactly , " Bill said . " Which is why we pay taxes to support Animal Control . Why do n't I go call them --  " " The pound ? " Thea 's voice was full of horror . " They do n't kill them all , " Bill said . " Just the sick ones . " Quinn looked behind her and met Thea 's disbelieving eyes . Yep , Quinn wanted to tell her , he really believes that . Instead , she patted the floor again . " Come here , baby . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand on her shoulder . " Come on , get up . " If she shrugged his hand off her shoulder , he 'd be hurt , and that was n't fair . " I 'm okay , " Quinn said . Bill moved his hand , and Quinn let out a breath she did n't know she 'd been holding . " I 'll just call --  " " Bill . " Quinn kept her voice as friendly as she could . " Go finish in the weight room so I can do this . I 'll be home at six . " Bill nodded , radiating tolerance and support in spite of her illogical resistance to Animal Control . " Sure . I 'll go warm up the car for you and bring it to the door first . " He patted her shoulder and said , " You stay here , " as if she 'd been planning to follow him , and after he left , she could picture him crunching his way across the icy parking lot toward her CRX as if slipping were n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved ice , and at six foot five , two hundred and forty-three healthy blond pounds , Bill was a Viking 's Viking . All of Tibbett adored Bill , a coach in a million , but Quinn was beginning to have doubts . And it was so unfair of her to have doubts . She knew he 'd warm the car for her , first opening the door with his key instead of hers , which was another thing about him that bothered her , that he 'd had that key cut without her permission two years ago when they 'd first begun to date . But since he 'd had the key cut so he could keep her gas tank filled , it was completely illogical that she should be annoyed . It was wrong to complain about a man who was unfailingly clean , generous , considerate , protective , understanding , and successful , and who 'd shelled out hundreds of dollars in fossil fuel for her since 1997 . Really , the dumbass was the perfect man . Quinn looked at the dog again and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this storeroom , I 'm taking a serious look at my love life . " Thea said , " What ? " but even before she finished the word , Quinn was shaking her head . " Never mind . You do n't have any food in that bag , do you ? I know I could just go in and grab it , but it 's so scared , I 'd rather it came to me on its own . " " Wait . " Thea fished around in the huge leather bag she carried everywhere and came up with half a granola bar . " Granola , " Quinn said . " What the hell . " She unwrapped it and broke off a piece and slid it across the floor to the dog . It shrank back and then edged forward , its little black nose quivering . " It 's good , " Quinn whispered , and the dog took it delicately . " What a nice little dog , " Thea whispered beside her , and Quinn nodded and put another piece on the floor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take it , keeping its eyes on them just in case they did anything anti-dog , big dark liquid eyes that said to Quinn , Help me , save me , fix my life . " Come on , sweetie , " Quinn whispered , and the dog came closer for the next piece . " Almost , " Thea breathed , and the dog sat down in front of them , still wary but calmer as it chewed the granola . " Hi , " Quinn said . " Welcome to my world . " The dog tilted its head , and its little black whip of a tail began to dust the floor . It had one white eyebrow , Quinn noticed , and four white socks , and the tip of its tail was white , too , as if it had been dipped in paint . " I 'm going to pick you up , " Quinn told it . " No fast moves . " She reached out and picked it up gently as it cowered back a little , and then she sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave it the last of the granola , and it relaxed and chewed again as she stroked its back . " Really a sweet little dog , " she told Thea and smiled for the first time since Bill had walked in the room . Another problem solved . " Car 's here , " Bill said from the doorway , making the dog jump . " Now you can take it to Animal Control on your way to pizza . " Quinn patted the dog and counted her blessings . She was lucky to have Bill ; after all , she could have ended up with somebody difficult to live with , somebody like her father , who lived for ESPN , or her ex-brother-in-law , who was congenitally incapable of commitment . Nick would have dumped her after a year and moved on from boredom , which was a lousy reason to dump anybody . If it had n't been , she would have left Bill long ago . " It 's out on the old highway , " Bill said . " Past the old drive-in . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks for the granola . " She stood up , still cuddling the dog , and Bill picked up her coat . " Put that thing down , " he said and held her coat for her . Quinn passed the dog over to Thea and let Bill help her shrug into her coat . " Do n't stay too long with Darla , " he said and kissed her cheek again , and she moved past him to take the dog back , wanting the warmth of its wiry little body in her arms . It looked up at her anxiously , and she said , " We 're fine , do n't worry . " Bill walked them to the door and then outside into the cold March wind , holding Quinn 's car door open for her while she asked Thea , " You need a ride ? " Thea said , " Nope . See you tomorrow . " She hesitated , casting a wary eye at Bill and added , " Thanks , McKenzie . " " My pleasure , " Quinn said , and Thea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quinn slid into the driver 's seat . " You are going to take it to Animal Control , right ? " Bill said as he held her door open . Quinn turned away . " I 'll see you later . " She pulled the door shut and Bill sighed as if his worst suspicions had been confirmed . She looked down at the dog now standing tensely on her lap , and said , " You know , you 're messing up my day , " in her most friendly voice . Nothing wrong here , nothing at all , everything 's fine in this car , especially if you 're a dog . " I was supposed to meet Darla for pizza at three-thirty , and now I 'm late . You were n't part of my plan . " The dog 's eyes were bright , almost interested , and Quinn smiled because it looked so smart . " I bet you are smart , " she said . " I bet you 're the smartest dog around . " The dog folded its bony little butt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it cocked its head at her . " Very cute . " She stroked its shiny smooth coat , feeling how cold it was , no insulation to keep a body warm , and the dog shuddered under her hand , all sinew and muscle and tension . Quinn unbuttoned her coat and wrapped it around the trembling little body until only its head poked out , and it sighed against her and snuggled into her heat . The snuggle was immensely gratifying -- a solid , simple , physical thank you , no strings attached -- and Quinn let herself enjoy the pleasure of the moment even though she knew it was n't hers to have . Bill would be upset if he saw her , telling her she could get bit or fleas or God knew what , but Quinn knew this dog would n't bite , and it was too cold for fleas . Probably . " It 's okay , " she said , looking down into the dog 's dark , grateful eyes . It pushed its head under her coat , looking for more warmth and safety , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day . Teaching art was never easy -- days full of X-Acto knife cuts and spilled paint and officious principals and artistic despair -- and lately she 'd been tenser than usual , a little depressed , as if something was wrong and she was n't fixing it . But now as she cuddled the dog closer and it dug one of its bony little knees into her stomach , she felt better . " What a sweetie you are , " she whispered into her coat . Bill rapped on the window , making the dog jerk its head out , and Quinn exhaled through her teeth before she rolled it down . " What ? " " I was just thinking , " Bill said , and then he looked down and saw the dog inside her coat . " Is that a good idea ? " " Yes , " Quinn said . " What were you just thinking ? " " You 're going to be late for pizza with Darla anyway , " Bill said , " so it makes sense to take it to Animal Control now so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 'll find a home faster that way . " Quinn imagined the little dog shivering on a cold concrete floor , trapped and alone and afraid behind thick steel bars , doubly betrayed because she 'd promised it warmth . She looked down into its dark , dark eyes again . Somebody had thrown this darling little dog away . It was n't going to happen again . I will not betray you . " Be practical , Quinn . " Bill sounded sympathetic but firm . " Animal Control is a clean , warm place . " Her coat was a clean , warm place , too , but that would be a childish thing to say . Okay , she could n't keep the dog , that would n't be practical , she had to give it to somebody , but there was no way in hell it was going to Animal Control . So who ? The dog looked at her with trusting eyes . Almost adoring eyes , really . Quinn smiled down at it . She needed to find somebody kind , somebody calm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Nick , " she told Bill . " Nick does not want a dog , " Bill said . " Animal Control --  " " We do n't know that . " Quinn cuddled the dog closer . " He owns his apartment over the service station so he wo n't have a landlord problem . I bet he 'd like this dog . " " Nick is not going to take this dog , " Bill said firmly , and Quinn knew he was right . As Darla had once pointed out , the best way to describe Nick was tall , dark , and detached from humanity . She was grasping at a particularly weak straw if she thought Nick was going to put himself out for a dog . " Take it to Animal Control , " Bill said , and Quinn shook her head . " Why ? " Bill said and Quinn almost said , Because I want her . The thought was so completely selfish and felt so completely right that Quinn looked at the dog with new eyes . Maybe she was meant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the thought of doing something that impractical was almost sexual , it was so intense . I do n't care that it 's not sensible , she could say . I want her . How selfish . How exciting . Quinn 's heart beat faster thinking about it . Just a little selfish . A dog was such a small thing to want , not a change of life or a change of lover or really a change of anything much . Just a little change . Just a little dog . Something new in her life . Something different . She held the dog closer . Her mother 's best friend , Edie , had been telling her for years to stop settling , to stop being so practical , to stop fixing everybody else and fix herself . " I 'm not broken , " she 'd told Edie , but maybe Edie was right . Maybe she 'd start small , with a dog , with this dog , with a little change , a little fix , and then she could move on to bigger things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You could n't argue with destiny . Look what happened to all the Greek heroes who 'd tried . " You ca n't keep the dog , " Bill said , and Quinn said , " Let me talk to Edie . " Bill smiled , his handsome face flooding with relief and goodwill . One happy Viking . " Great idea . Edie 's all alone . She could use this dog for company . Now you 're thinking . " That 's not what I meant , Quinn wanted to say , but there was no point in starting a fight , so she said , " Thank you , good-bye , " instead . She rolled the window up , looking into the dog 's dark eyes . " You 're going to be just fine . " The dog sighed a little and rested her head on Quinn 's chest , keeping eye contact as if her life depended on it , trembling a little bit in her intensity . Smart , smart dog . Quinn patted her to slow her quivering and smiled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the song . A pretty , skinny K-K-K-Katie . " She bent closer and whispered , " My Katie , " and the dog sighed her agreement and burrowed back to shiver into the dark warmth of Quinn 's coat . Outside the window , Bill waved at her , clearly pleased she was being so practical , and she waved back . She could deal with him later , but now she was late to eat pizza . With her dog .  - -   - -   - -  - Across Town , in the brightly lit second bay of Ziegler Brothers ' Garage and Service Station , Nick Ziegler leaned under the hood of Barbara Niedemeyer 's Camry and scowled at the engine . As far as he could tell , there was nothing wrong with it , which meant Barbara had an ulterior motive , and he had a pretty good idea what it was , given Barbara 's taste for married blue-collar men . His brother Max 's number must have come up . This was going to be a problem for Max , but nothing for Nick to worry about in general . People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd decided long ago when he 'd gone to hell in his , and if he had some scars from past screwups , he had some interesting memories , too . No point in getting in the way of Max 's memories . He slammed the hood shut on Barbara 's Trojan horse , pulled a rag out of his back pocket , and wiped the gleaming paint to make sure he had n't left fingerprints . Then he walked over to the third garage bay to inspect his next problem , Bucky Manchester 's muffler . " Did you find a leak in the Toyota ? " Max asked Nick from the door to the office . " There is no oil leak . " Nick stood under Bucky 's Chevy , wiping his hands on the rag , surveying the damage . The b-pipe looked like brown lace . He 'd have to call Bucky and tell him there would be significant money involved . Bucky would n't be happy , but he 'd trust him . " That 's what I told Barbara , " Max said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' That woman is just overcautious . " Nick considered warning Max that Barbara was not interested in a phantom oil leak , but he did n't consider it for long . Max was n't a cheater , and even if he lost his mind and actually contemplated it , there was Darla . Darla was not the kind of wife a man messed around on and lived to tell the tale . Barbara was a nonproblem . " She 's never been that fussy about her car before , " Max groused on as he came out of the office . " You 'd think she did n't trust us anymore . " He stopped to squint out one of the windows in the door of the first bay . " Did Bill knock Quinn up when we were n't looking ? " Nick 's hand tightened on the rag , and he stared at the b-pipe for a couple of seconds before he answered . " Does n't seem like something Bill would do . " " She 's going into the Upper Cut . " Max squinted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's holding her stomach . Maybe she 's sick . " The door was on Nick 's way to the office anyway , so he walked over and ducked his head to look past Max 's ear . Quinn did look awkward as she struggled with the door to the beauty parlor , her navy peacoat bunched bulky around her stomach , her long , strong , jeans-clad legs braced against the wind , the auburn swash of her pageboy swinging forward as she bent over . Then she turned to lean into the door , and he saw a dog poke its head up from the neck of her coat . " Forget it , " he told Max . " It 's a dog . " " I am not adopting another dog , " Max said . " Two is more than enough . " Nick stopped at the sink to get the last of the oil off his hands . " Maybe she 's going to give it to Lois . " " It 's Wednesday , " Max said gloomily . " She 's meeting Darla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and then we 'll have to get used to another one . " Then he brightened . " Unless Lois kicks her out for bringing the dog in . She 's awful particular about that beauty parlor . " Nick nudged the tap with his wrist . " If Quinn wants to take the dog in , Lois will let her . " The hot water splashed over his hands , and he scrubbed gritty soap into them , paying more attention than usual because he was irritated with Max and he did n't like being irritated with Max . Nick turned the taps off and dried his hands and heard Max finish a sentence he 'd missed the beginning of . " What ? " " I said , Lois would have to be in an awful good mood to let that happen . " " She probably is . " Nick 's annoyance made him go on to add a little grief to Max 's life . " She 's probably heard that Barbara dumped Matthew . " Max looked as startled as possible for somebody with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barbara Niedemeyer set Lois 's husband free , " Nick said . " Pete Cantor told me this morning . " Max pointed a finger at Nick . " Anything else Barbara wants checked , you 're doing . " " Why do n't you just run a full check on the damn car now so she does n't have to come back ? " Nick walked over to the office to call Bucky . " Save us both a lot of trouble . " " She 's a good-looking woman , " Max said . " Good job at the bank . You check the car . " " I do n't need a woman with a good job . Barbara 's car is all yours and so is Barbara . " " You own half the garage , " Max said . " Hell , you 're single . Why is n't she asking you to check her oil leak ? " " Because she likes you better , thank God . " As Nick went in the office , he heard Max let out a sigh behind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from where he stood dialing Bucky , he heard the hood go up on Barbara 's Toyota . " Nick ? " Max said from under the hood . " Yeah ? " " Sorry about that crack about Quinn . I did n't mean it the way it came out . " Nick listened to the busy signal at the Manchesters ' and thought of Quinn , warm and determined and dependable , the complete opposite of her scatty sister , Zo . Quinn in trouble was n't funny . " Does n't matter . " " I know you 're close . " Nick hung up . " Not that close . " When Max did n't say anything else , Nick went back into the garage and put his mind where it belonged , on the Chevy . Cars were understandable . They took a little patience and a lot of knowledge , but they always worked the same way . They were fixable . Which was more than he could say for people . Nothing a good mechanic could have done about him and Zo , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more ; even the news she 'd gotten married again ten years ago had n't made much more than a crease in his concentration . Nothing like the crease Max had just made with that crack about Quinn . " Nick ? " Max 's voice was still a little worried , so Nick said , " You do n't suppose Barbara has two cars , do you ? You could be spending some significant time with her . " " Funny , " Max said , but he went back to work and let Nick concentrate on the muffler . It was the only real problem he had , anyway , since Max would never cheat on Darla , and Quinn was always rescuing strays and giving them away . Nothing in his world was going to change . Except Bucky Manchester 's b-pipe . Across the street , Darla Ziegler plopped herself onto the beat-up tweed couch in the tiny break room of the Upper Cut just as Lois Ferguson came in scowling , her impossibly orange upsweep making her look like a small torch . Lois had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd taken over the Upper Cut six years before , but Darla had watched Lois eat paste in kindergarten . After that , there was no turning back . " You done for the day ? " Lois snapped . " It 's only four . " " It 's pizza day , " Darla said . " I 'm done . " " Well , you made that Ginny Spade looked good , I 'll give you that . " Lois folding her arms so tightly that her gray smock stretched flat over her bony little chest . " Better'n she has in years . " " Yeah , maybe now she 'll meet somebody and get over that worthless , cheating Roy , " Darla said , and then kicked herself for forgetting that it had only been a year since Lois had lost a worthless , cheating Matthew . " Matthew wants to come back , " Lois said , and Darla sat up a little to pay attention to Lois for a change just as Quinn came breezing in the door from the shop with her copper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I know I 'm late , " she said . " I 'm sorry --  " Darla blinked her surprise at the dog and then held up her hand . " Wait a minute . " She looked at Lois . " You are kidding me . He left her ? " " Who left who ? " Quinn struggled to shrug her coat off one arm at a time . The dog looked fairly ratty , Darla noticed . But rescuing ugly dogs was business as usual for Quinn and not nearly as interesting as the bomb Lois had just dropped , so she kept her attention on Lois . " That 's a dog , " Lois said . " Good call . " Quinn draped her coat over the back of one of the avocado armchairs . " I 'll hold on to her . She 'll never touch the floor , I swear . Who left who ? " " Ha . " Lois 's lips curved in a tight little smile as she returned to her triumph . " Barbara left Matthew . The Bank Slut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quinn sank into her chair with the dog cradled in her arms . " Jeez . " Darla sat back , exhaling as she considered the development . " They 've been tighter than ticks for a whole year . What happened ? " " Something on that damn trip to Florida they took . " Lois 's lips pressed together harder . " He never took me on any damn trip to Florida . " Darla ran down the possibilities in her mind . " Another man ? " " If it was , he 's gone , too . She 's in town , and she 's living alone in that little house of hers , and Matthew 's down at the Anchor . " Lois sat down in the other rump-sprung armchair across from Darla . " He wants to move back . " Darla shrugged . " That makes sense . What guy wants to live in a motel ? " " You going to take him back ? " Quinn asked . Lois shrugged . " Why should I ? I got the house to myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Darla thought about Max . " Friendship . Fun . Sex . Memories . Somebody to kiss on New Year 's Eve . " " He left me for a Bank Slut , " Lois said . " How much friendship do you think we got at this point ? " Something about the way Lois rolled the words Bank Slut off her tongue made Darla fairly sure Lois was n't focusing her anger on Matthew . Maybe this marriage could be saved . Lois would sure be easier to work for if it could . " You married him the day after we graduated . You were with him for sixteen years . He only spent a year with Barbara Niedemeyer , and now he 's sorry . That 's something . " At least , Darla assumed he was sorry . If he wanted to come back to Lois knowing how bitchy she could be even before he left her for a younger woman , he must be really sorry now . " And he makes good money . " She thought back to the last time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good money . " " I make good money , too , " Lois said . " Who needs him ? " " Well , you do , " Quinn said , practical as always , " or you would n't be talking about it . " " It just makes me mad , that 's all . " Lois 's jaw clenched tighter before she went on . " We were doing just fine , and then she comes in with her broken bathtub drain and stopped-up sink and plans for a second bath downstairs , like she needed a second bathroom , living there all alone , if you ask me , she had it planned --  " Darla tuned her out , having heard this rant before , several times , in fact , since Barbara Niedemeyer had walked off with Matthew the previous April . As far as Barbara planning it , well , it was n't as if Matthew had been her first married man . Really , Lois should have caught on when Barbara had started talking about the second bathroom . Darla would have caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a track record . Matthew was number three , for heaven 's sake . "  - -  and now he thinks he 's going to come waltzing back in , " Lois finished . " Well , the hell with him . " " I 'd think about it some more , " Darla said . " Barbara 's sort of like the flu . Men catch her , but then they get over her . Gil and Louis do n't seem to have any warm feelings for her . Last I heard , Louis was getting married again . I mean , obviously , Barbara 's men recover . And Matthew makes damn good money , so he 's going to have his chances if you do n't take him back . " Lois glared at her . " She has a point , " Quinn said . " If you want him back . " Darla spread her hands and tried to look innocent . " All I 'm saying is , if you really did n't care , you would n't be this mad . Take him back . Make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take you on a damn trip to Florida . " " You do n't get it , " Lois said . " What if it was Max ? " The thought of Max cheating was so ridiculous , Darla almost snickered . Max was gorgeous and about as nice as a human male could be , but women did n't even flirt with him because he was so clearly Happily Married . Or at least , if she were honest , clearly uninterested in any change in his life . That was n't quite the same thing , really . Darla 's urge to snicker faded , and she told herself she was lucky to have a guy who was so content . " I 'd say , Max , you jackass , what the hell were you thinking ? ' " she told Lois . " And then I 'd take him back . He 's your husband , Lois . He fucked up and he should pay , but you should n't just give up on him . " Lois still looked mad , but there was some thoughtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't love him anymore , " Quinn said . " Unless you really want to be free to do what you want . " " Hello ? " Darla said to her . This was n't like Quinn , the fixer . " Of course she wants him back . " Lois stood up . " That 's ridiculous , " she said and went back out to the shop , slamming the door behind her . " You know , I do n't understand Barbara , " Quinn said , frowning as she patted the dog in her lap . " She 's a nice woman . Why does she keep snagging other women 's husbands ? " " Because she 's not a nice woman , " Darla said flatly . " What 's with you telling Lois to be free ? Lois wants to be free like she wants to be middle-aged . " " I just thought she should think about it , " Quinn said , settling back in her chair , not meeting Darla 's eyes at all . " There 's nothing that says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . " " It is in Tibbett , " Darla said . " You really think Lois wants to hang out at Bo 's Bar &; Grill and pick up divorced drunks for recreation ? " Quinn made a face . " Oh , come on . There has to be a middle ground between marriage and Bo 's . " " Sure . There 's Edie 's life . " Darla stretched out on the couch again . " Teaching all week , going to garage sales with your mom on her time off , reheating leftovers in a lonely house at night . " It sounded like hell to Darla . " Alone does n't have to mean lonely , " Quinn said . " I think Edie likes the solitude -- she 's always talking about how good it is to get home where it 's quiet . And you can be with somebody and be lonely . " As far as Darla was concerned , being lonely with somebody was probably the way most people lived . Not that she was lonely with Max . Quinn cuddled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Darla narrowed her eyes . " Something wrong with you and Bill ? " Quinn stared down into the dog 's eyes . " No . " " Okay , " Darla said . " Out with it . Quinn shifted in her chair again while the dog watched them both . " I 'm going to keep this dog . " You have beige carpeting , Darla wanted to say , but it did n't seem supportive . " Bill wants me to take her to Animal Control , " Quinn went on . " But I 'm keeping her . I do n't care what he says . " " Jeez . " Darla caught the lift of Quinn 's chin and felt the first faint stirrings of alarm . Bill was being incredibly dumb about this . " He 's known you for two years , and he does n't know you any better than to think you 'd take a dog to the pound ? " " It 's the practical thing to do , " Quinn said , her eyes still on the dog . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you are . " Darla felt definitely uneasy now . The one thing she 'd always wanted for Quinn was a marriage as good as her own . All right , Bill was a little boring , but so was Max . You could n't have everything . You compromised . That was what marriages were about . " What if he says , It 's the dog or me ' ? Tell me you 're not going to risk your relationship over a dog . " The dog looked over as she spoke , almost as if it were narrowing its eyes at her , and Darla noticed for the first time how sneaky it looked . Tempting . Almost devilish . Well , that made sense . If Quinn had been in Eden , Satan would have showed up as a cocker spaniel . " Bill 's not difficult like that . " Quinn leaned back , obviously trying to sound nonchalant and only sounding tenser because of it . " We do n't have problems . He wants every day to be the same , and since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be Max . " Well , that 's men for you . " " The thing is , I do n't think that 's enough for me . " Quinn petted the dog , who leaned into her , gazing up at her with those hypnotic dark eyes , luring her into messing with a perfectly good relationship . " It 's starting to get to me , knowing this is going to be my life forever . I mean , I love teaching , and Bill 's a good guy --  " " Wait a minute . " Darla sat up . " Bill 's a great guy . " Quinn shrank back a little . " I know . " " He works his butt off for those kids on the team , " Darla said . " And he stayed after school to coach Mark for the SATs --  " " I know . " "  - -  and he 's the first one in line every time there 's a charity drive --  " " I know . " "  - -  and he was teacher of the year last year , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " "  - -  and he treats you like a queen , " Darla finished . " Well , I 'm tired of that , " Quinn said , her chin sticking out again . " Look , Bill 's nice -- okay , he 's great , " she said , holding up her hands as Darla started to object again . " But what we have , it 's not exciting . I 've never had exciting . And with the way Bill plans things , I 'm never going to have exciting . " I did , Darla wanted to say . She and Max had been hot as hell once . She could see him now -- that look in his eye as he zeroed in on her , that grin that said , I have plans for you , the way they laughed together -- but you could n't expect that to last . They 'd been married seventeen years . You could n't keep exciting for seventeen years . " It 's not really Bill 's fault , " Quinn said . " I mean , I did n't have exciting before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it 's in the cards for me . I 'm not an exciting person . " Darla opened her mouth and shut it again . Quinn was a darling , but --  " See ? " Quinn finally met Darla 's eyes , defeated . " You want to tell me I 'm exciting and you ca n't . Zo was exciting , I 'm dull . Mama used to say , Some people are oil paintings and some people are watercolors , ' but what she meant was , Zo is interesting and you 're sort of washed out . ' " " You 're the dependable one , " Darla said . " You 're the one everybody leans on . If you were exciting , we 'd all be screwed . " Quinn slumped back . " Well , I 'm tired of that . And it 's not like I 'm going out Bungee-jumping or something stupid . I just want this dog . " The dog looked up at her again , and Darla 's uneasiness morphed into real dread . " That 's not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much to want , is it ? " " Well , that depends . " Darla glared at the dog . This is all your fault . " Do n't you ever want more ? " Quinn leaned forward , her hazel eyes now fixed on Darla 's with a passion that made her uncomfortable . " Do n't you ever look at your life and say , Is this all there is ? ' " " No , " Darla said . " No , no , I do n't . Look , sometimes you have to settle for less than you want to keep your relationship going . " " You 've never settled with Max , " Quinn said , and Darla bit her lip . " Well , now I 'm going to be like you . Just this once , I 'm not going to settle . " She cuddled the dog closer , and Darla thought , Everybody settles . The dog looked over at Darla , daring her to say it out loud , the devil in disguise . Forget it , Darla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble . " So what do you want on your pizza ? " Darla leaned across the table and picked up the phone . " The usual , right ? " " No , " Quinn said . " I want something different . "
