Screaming Orgasm <p> 1 oz white crFme de cacao <p> 1 oz Amaretto almond liqueur <p> 1 oz triple sec <p> 1 oz vodka 2 oz light cream <p> Serves two . <p> Natalie Fanshaw did something that night she 'd never done in her twenty-nine years on earth . She walked into a bar alone . <p> She hovered in the doorway of the Driftwood Bar and Grill in Orca Bay , California , not sure whether to move forward or turn around and head back to her hotel room . It was n't that she was desperate for a drink , it was more that she could n't sit at the too-small desk in her hotel room and look at those spreadsheets for one more minute without going crazy . <p> The Driftwood was a popular cocktails and dinner destination . They specialized in fresh seafood , like mussels served in buckets more ways than Natalie could have imagined , and seared mahimahi with a Thai curry glaze . <p> The hostess approached her with a menu , her eyebrows raised . Shaking her head at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shoulders back and walked with purpose . Up to the gray granite bar . There were a dozen or so stools in brushed metal with black leather seats . A young couple had their stools pushed so close together they touched from knee to thigh . <p> Natalie chose a seat at the other end and hiked herself up onto it . <p> She placed her purse on the empty stool beside her in a clear Keep Away signal , then glanced around . She 'd never been here before , but she knew the place by reputation . She was surprised how busy it was for a Wednesday night . Almost every table was taken , mostly by couples . These looked like romantic rather than business transactions  --  unlike most of her dinners out . The decor of the room was upscale casual , with a beach theme that would have looked a lot better without all the pink-and-red stuff hanging from the ceiling . And what was with the corny , oversize papier-mGchT hearts wafting around like a cardiologist 's nightmare ? <p> " Help you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a terrible thought struck her . " Oh , no , " she said , her gaze still transfixed by those swinging hearts . " Please tell me it 's not Valentine 's Day ? " <p> She glanced up at the bartender who 'd spoken , and looked into the bluest eyes she had ever seen . And they were twinkling at her as though the gorgeous guy with the disheveled hair and the deeply tanned face was laughing at her without involving his mouth . " Okay , " he said , " I wo n't tell you . " <p> Grabbing her purse , she pulled out her BlackBerry . How had she not noticed the significance of the date ? February 14 . " My secretary should have reminded me , " she complained bitterly . <p> " Somebody you forgot to send flowers to ? " <p> She shook her head . " No . But I would have been more careful . " She glanced around once more , now seeing the obvious . The twosomes holding hands , the low-voiced conversations that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , I love you . " Of all the nights in all the cities she 'd traveled to , she had to pick this one to brave a bar alone . " I am the only singleton trapped in the Love Shack . " <p> The bartender laughed . Low and sexy . His shirt was open at the collar . If it was hers she 'd have ironed it into crisp perfection , but she had to admit the rumpled cotton looked good on him , maybe because it went with his mussed hair and aura of relaxed untidiness , as if he 'd just rolled out of bed . " You 're not the only one . " <p> She glanced up , inquiring . <p> " I 'm stuck here , too . " <p> Was he telling her he was single , also ? She was so out of touch with the whole male-female thing that she was n't sure that 's what he meant . Maybe he was simply complaining that he had to work when there was some hot chick still in his bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , since we 're both here , what can I get you ? " <p> " Oh . " She looked at the rows of bottles lined up against the mirrored wall behind him . As exotic as a jewelry store , the wall winked at her . Bottles glowed with blue , pink and red . An entire row was devoted to Scotch whisky , some of which she knew was much older than she . <p> Then she ordered what she always ordered . " A glass of white wine , please . " <p> She had her second shock of the night . <p> The bartender shook his head . <p> " You do n't carry white wine ? " <p> " Sure we do . But white wine is not for you . Not tonight . " <p> Both intrigued and mildly annoyed  --  since Natalie was a woman who always knew her own mind , was famous in fact for her decision making  --  she said , " And what do you have in mind for me ? Tonight ? " <p> The moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them back as fast as the couple down the other end of the bar were tossing back their martinis . Her words sounded low , sexy , like a come-on . The last thing she 'd intended . She shifted uncomfortably on her seat . One quick drink and she was out of hearts-and-chocolates land . <p> The man behind the bar seemed not to notice her discomfort . He regarded her from those eyes that reminded her of the ocean and said , " Have you ever had a Blue Crush ? " <p> Lord , she was having one now , looking into those blue , blue eyes and feeling her pulse speed up a little bit . She knew she was overtired , but still , it was quite a reaction she was having to a man she could not have less in common with . <p> " I 've had Orange Crush , " she said , " when I was a kid . " <p> He grinned at her , even white teeth that could eat her all up . " Trust me , this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , What the hell ? Here I am on Valentine 's Day , with no Valentine , I might at least try a new drink . <p> " Okay , " she said . " I 'll trust you . " <p> " You wo n't be sorry . " <p> Why did she find that so hard to believe ? <p> " Right now , " a twangy female voice suddenly said , coming from Natalie 's left , " I need two Screaming Orgasms , one Sex on the Beach and a Roll Between the Sheets . " <p> " You and me both , " Natalie said . She did n't realize she 'd spoken aloud until the woman gave a bray of laughter that was altogether bigger than her small frame could hold . <p> " It 's Valentine 's Day , " the tiny waitress explained in a confidential tone . " They think if they order the raunchy drinks , they 'll get laid . " <p> " Does it work ? " <p> The woman flipped her red-gold ponytail over her shoulder when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for yourself . " <p> Natalie looked around , and felt suddenly as though she were behind a velvet rope on the outside of one of those exclusive A-list parties one read about . And the biggest bouncer in the world was keeping her on the wrong side of the barrier . <p> On the other side were couples . She was no expert on mating rituals , but she could sense from the way they leaned toward each other , shared food and sipped each other 's drinks that these men and women were n't going home to calculators and spreadsheets for company . <p> Sex was in the air as decidedly as the aroma of fresh seafood and garlic butter . <p> One young man had his shoe off and was tracing the inner thigh of his date with his stockinged foot , not at all shy about the fact that anyone glancing his way would see what he was up to . Of course , most of the dinner guests were too interested in their own dates to glance anywhere else . One woman gave the man across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fondue , and when a sensuously rich dribble of chocolate hit his chin , they both ignored his napkin . She gave a tiny smile , leaned close , breasts thrusting forward from a skimpy top , the tip of her pink tongue showing , and licked the chocolate off . <p> Thoroughly . <p> " Oh , my , " Natalie said , her hand going to her chest . Not that she was a prude , but there was a lot of raw sexual energy in the room . It got to a person . <p> " Do n't worry , " the bartender said , " we 've got plenty of fire extinguishers . If the heat gets out of hand , we blast them . " <p> " Oh , Johnny , " the cocktail waitress said , with the lazy affection perfected by Southern women . She rolled her eyes , collecting her drinks on a round tray and departed . <p> " Johnny ? " Natalie stared at the man in front of her . Of course he had no name badge . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time she 'd been in town she 'd discovered he was locally famous . With women . " You 're Hot Johnny ? " <p> Blue Crush <p> 1 oz blue curatao 1 oz Cointreau <p> 1 oz vodka <p> 1 oz Malibu rum <p> Crushed ice <p> Orange twist for garnish <p> Johnny laughed . He could n't help it . He 'd never seen anyone give away her inner thoughts so easily as the blushing woman sitting staring at him did . <p> How could anyone so uptight , business suited and restrained be so much fun ? <p> " People usually do n't call me that to my face . " <p> Of course he 'd heard his nickname ; he 'd lived in Orca Bay for fifteen years . The nickname was n't something he 'd asked for . But Johnny had learned a long time ago that when things were good you should n't fight them . Women liked him . He figured it was an accident of Fate . And he 'd love to meet Fate someday and shake him by the hand and buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Johnny liked women , too . Genuinely liked their different styles and shapes and colors . Some men might write off the single woman who climbed onto a bar stool carrying a briefcase on Valentine 's Day , but Johnny did n't . He liked her contrasts . Her conservative suit and the comments that escaped her mouth seemingly by accident . Her neat hairstyle and the kinky waves that suggested wildness . Her first choice , white wine , so predictable but look how quickly she 'd been willing to try something new . <p> Definitely , there were interesting depths beneath the surface of this woman . <p> " I 'm sorry , " she said , flustered . " I did n't mean to be rude , but I heard some women talking about you . " Suddenly , she blushed scarlet and he had to wonder what she 'd overheard . <p> Hell , tonight would be a long one . Everybody seemed to be part of a couple except for him and this woman who had n't even realized it was Valentine 's Day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " I ca n't remember . " <p> " Should n't lie on Valentine 's Day . It 's bad luck . " <p> She glanced at her BlackBerry as though hoping it would ring , or beep or something . But it remained as silent as he did , waiting for her answer . <p> " It might have been something about kissing . " <p> Now he truly was intrigued . Who gossiped about kissing ? " What about it ? " <p> " It was just idle chitchat , you know the way women go on . I overheard these two talking . Accidentally , you know . I was in a restaurant , having a quick breakfast and reading the paper . The woman mentioned Hot Johnny and she got to kissing one time and she almost  --  " the blush deepened "  --  you know " Now she waved in the general direction of the main dining room , " Like the drink . " <p> He was wondering why this woman spent so much time in restaurants alone , and could picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have widened when she got sex talk along with her morning coffee . " What drink ? " <p> " The Screaming Orgasm . " She whispered the words . <p> " Are you saying she almost came from kissing me ? " How cool was that ? <p> " No . She said that . This woman . Who called you Hot Johnny , and then the other woman saidwell , anyway . That 's how I heard of you . " <p> " What did she look like ? The woman who almost , you know " <p> " I do n't know , I did n't really see her . Blond , I think . " <p> " Huh . " In California , that really narrowed it down . Not that the woman 's identity mattered . Did n't sound like they 'd ever gone beyond mouth action . Whatever . <p> His new customer was certainly making his night more interesting , he thought , as he mixed the Blue Crush . He barely thought about his actions as he poured blue curatao , rum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole a thorough blending and strained the blue concoction into a martini glass . <p> He reached for a twist of orange peel , knowing she was watching his every move , and added an extra twist , giving the shape a sensual sinuousness as it looped around the edge of the glass the way a stripper might twine herself around a pole . <p> " Thank you . " She eyed it for a moment , as though regretting her rash departure from white wine , then sipped slowly . <p> He watched her , enjoying the way her eyes widened slightly at the taste , the way she licked her lips consciously , a tiny frown pulling her brows together . <p> She stayed like that for a moment , almost Zen-like in her perfect stillness , as though every part of her were involved in tasting and evaluating her drink . <p> " Well ? " he finally asked . <p> " It 's good , " she said , delivering the verdict , then taking another tiny sip . " I thought it might be too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " It 's not . The drink 's named after a surfing wave . The kind that knocks you on your ass . " <p> " Oh . " She glanced with trepidation at the drink . " You mean ? " <p> " One wo n't do it . Do n't worry . " <p> " Oh , good , because I still have work to do tonight . " <p> He was about to ask , but Suzanne , the head waitress , marched up to the bar with a list of orders . <p> She was on her way again immediately . Efficiency on legs . <p> While he worked , he said , " So , tell me how come you 're here alone on Valentine 's Day ? " <p> She regarded him with great seriousness . " Is n't that sort of personal ? " <p> Deftly adding a couple of drops of vermouth to a dry martini , he set it on the bar and poured enough house red into a beaker for the waitress to pour a single glass . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me things . " <p> " And do they ? Like in the movies ? I thought that was a clichT . " <br> Continues ...
