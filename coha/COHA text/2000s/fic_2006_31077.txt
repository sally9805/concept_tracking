H.R.H. By Danielle Steel Random House Danielle Steel Christianna stood at her bedroom window , looking down at the hillside in the pouring rain . She was watching a large white dog , soaking wet with matted hair , digging excitedly in the mud . Every now and then he would look up at her and wag his tail , and then return to digging again . He was the Great Pyrenees her father had given her eight years before . His name was Charles , and in many ways he was her best friend . She laughed as she watched him chase a rabbit that eluded him and promptly disappeared . Charles barked frantically and then splashed happily through the mud again , looking for something else to pursue . He was having a great time , as Christianna was , watching him . It was the last of summer and the weather was still warm . She had returned to Vaduz in June , after four years of college in Berkeley . Coming home had been something of a shock , and so far the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cousins in England and Germany , and acquaintances throughout Europe , her only friend was Charles . She led a sheltered and isolated life , and always had . It seemed unlikely she would see her Berkeley friends again . As she watched the dog disappear toward the stables , Christianna hurried out of her room , intent on going outside and following him . She grabbed her riding slicker and a pair of rubber boots she used to muck out her horse 's stall , and ran down the backstairs . She was grateful that no one noticed her , and a moment later she was outside , sliding through the mud and running after the big white dog . She called his name , and in an instant he bounded up to her , nearly knocking her down . He wagged his tail , splashing water everywhere , put a muddy paw on her , and when she bent to stroke him , he reached up and licked her face , and then ran away again as she laughed . Together , they ran side by side along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the dog strayed from the path , she called his name , he hesitated only for an instant , and then came back to her each time . He was normally well behaved , but the rain excited him , as he ran and barked . Christianna was having as much fun as the dog . After nearly an hour , slightly out of breath , she stopped , the dog panting heavily beside her . She took a shortcut then , and half an hour later , they were once again back where they began . It had been a wonderful outing for both mistress and dog , and each looked as disreputable and disheveled as the other . Christianna 's long , almost white-blond hair was matted to her head , her face was wet , and even her eyelashes were stuck together . She never wore makeup , unless she had to go out or was likely to be photographed , and she was wearing the jeans she had brought back from Berkeley . They were a souvenir of her lost life . She had loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had fought hard to be allowed to go . Her brother had gone to Oxford , and her father had suggested the Sorbonne for her . Christianna had been adamant about going to college in the States , and her father had finally relented , though reluctantly . Going that far from home spelled freedom to her , and she had reveled in each day she was there , and had hated to come home when she graduated in June . She had made friends she missed sorely now , they were part of another life she missed so much . She had come home to face her responsibilities , and do what was expected of her . To Christianna , it felt like a heavy burden , lightened only by moments such as these , running through the woods with her dog . The rest of the time since coming home , she had felt as though she were in prison , serving a life sentence . There was no one she could have said that to , and doing so would have made her sound ungrateful for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had sensed , more than seen , her sadness since returning from the States . But there was nothing he could do about it . Christianna knew as well as he did that her childhood , and the freedom she had enjoyed in California , had come to an end . Charles looked up at his mistress questioningly as they reached the end of the bridle path , as though asking her if they really had to go back . " I know , " Christianna said softly , patting him , " I do n't want to either . " The rain felt gentle on her face , and she did n't mind getting soaked , or her long blond mane getting wet , any more than the dog did . The slicker protected her , and her boots were caked with mud . She laughed as she looked at him , thinking it was hard to believe that this muddy brown dog was really white . She needed the exercise , as did the dog . He wagged his tail as he looked at her , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . She was hoping to slip in the back door , but getting Charles into the house , in his disreputable condition , would be a greater challenge . He was too filthy to take upstairs , and she knew she would have to take him in through the kitchen . He was in desperate need of a bath after their muddy walk . She opened the kitchen door quietly , hoping to escape attention for as long as possible , but as soon as she opened it , the enormous muddy dog bounded past her , dashed into the middle of the room , and barked with excitement . So much for a quiet entrance , Christianna smiled ruefully , and glanced apologetically at the familiar faces around her . The people who worked in her father 's kitchen were always kind to her , and sometimes she wished that she could still sit among them , enjoying their company and the friendly atmosphere , as she had as a child . But those days were over for her as well . They no longer treated her as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friedrich was ten years older than she , and was traveling in Asia for the next six months . Christianna had turned twenty-three that summer . Charles was still barking and , shaking the water off enthusiastically , had splattered nearly everyone around him with mud , as Christianna tried vainly to subdue him . " I 'm so sorry , " she said as Tilda , the cook , wiped her face with her apron , shook her head , and smiled good naturedly at the young woman she had known since birth . She signaled quickly to a young man , who rushed to lead the dog away . " I 'm afraid he got awfully dirty , " Christianna said with a smile to the young man , wishing she could bathe the dog herself . She liked doing it , but she knew it was unlikely they would let her . Charles yelped unhappily as he was led away . " I do n't mind bathing him . . . , " Christianna said , but the dog was already gone . " Of course not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then used a clean towel to wipe Christianna 's face as well . If Christianna had still been a child , she would have scolded her and told her that she looked worse than the dog . " Would you like some lunch ? " Christianna had n't even thought of it , and shook her head . " Your father is still in the dining room . He just finished his soup . I could send something up for you . " Christianna hesitated , and then nodded . She had n't seen him all day , and she enjoyed the quiet moments they shared when he was n't working , and had a few minutes to himself , which was rare . He was usually surrounded by assorted members of his staff , and was in a rush to get to meetings . It was a treat for him to enjoy a meal alone , especially with her . She cherished the time they spent together . The only reason she had willingly come home from Berkeley was for him . There had been no other choice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school just so she could stay in the States . She did n't dare ask . She knew the answer would have been no . Her father wanted her at home . She knew she had to be doubly responsible because her brother was n't at all . If Friedrich had been willing to shoulder his responsibilities , it would have lightened the burden on her . But there was no hope of that . She left her slicker hanging on a peg outside the kitchen , and took off her boots . They were noticeably smaller than any other pair there . She had tiny feet , and was so small she was almost a miniature . In flat shoes , her brother often teased her that she looked like a little girl , particularly with her long blond hair , which was still hanging wet down her back . She had small delicate hands , a perfect figure nothing like a child 's , although she was very slight and always just a little bit too thin , and a face like a cameo . People said she looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was as fair as she was , although both he and her brother were very tall , well over six feet . Christianna 's mother had been as small as she was and had died when Christianna was five , and Friedrich was fifteen . Their father had never remarried . Christianna was the lady of the house , and was often her father 's hostess now at important dinners or events . It was one of the responsibilities expected of her , and although she did n't enjoy it , it was a duty she performed lovingly for him . She and her father had always been extremely close . He had always been sensitive to the fact that it had been hard for her growing up without a mother . And in spite of his many duties , he had made every effort to be both father and mother to her , not always an easy task . Christianna bounded up the back stairs in jeans , sweater , and stocking feet . She arrived in the pantry slightly breathless , nodded at the people there , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting at the dining table alone , poring over a stack of papers , wearing his glasses , with a serious look on his face . He did n't hear Christianna come in . He glanced up and smiled as she slipped silently in to the chair beside him . He was obviously pleased to see his daughter , he always was . " What have you been up to , Cricky ? " He had called her that since she was a little girl . He gently patted her head as she leaned over to kiss him , and he noticed her wet hair . " You 've been out in the rain . Were you riding in this weather ? " He worried about her , more than he did about Freddy . Christianna had always been so small and seemed so fragile to him . Ever since losing his wife to cancer eighteen years before , he had treated their daughter like the priceless gift she had been to them when she was born . She looked so much like her mother . His late wife had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was French , half Orleans and half Bourbon , the two royal families of France , who had been the ruling monarchy before the French Revolution . Christianna was descended from royal families on all sides . Her father 's ancestors were mostly German , with cousins in England . Her father 's native tongue was German , though he and Christianna 's mother had always spoken French , as she did with her children . Once she was gone , in her memory , Christianna 's father had continued speaking to his children in French . It was still the language in which Christianna was most comfortable , and which she preferred , although she spoke German , Italian , Spanish , and English as well . Her English had improved immeasurably during her years in college in California , and she was totally fluent now . " You should n't go out riding in the rain , " he scolded her gently . " You 'll catch a cold , or worse . " He always feared her getting ill , excessively so , he acknowledged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't riding , " she explained . " I just went for a run with the dog . " As she said it , a footman set her soup down in front of her , in delicate two-hundred-year-old gold-rimmed Limoges . The set had been her French grandmother 's , and Christianna knew there were many equally handsome services of china from her father 's ancestors as well . " Are you very busy today , Papa ? " Christianna asked quietly , as he nodded , and pushed his papers away with a sigh . " No more than usual . So many problems in the world , so many things that ca n't be solved . Human problems are so complicated these days . Nothing is simple anymore . " Her father was well known for his humanitarian concerns . It was one of the many things she admired about him . He was a man worthy of respect , and was regarded with great affection by all who knew him . He was a man of compassion , integrity , and courage , and had set a powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned from his example and listened to what he said . Freddy was far more self-indulgent , and paid no attention to his father 's edicts , wisdom , or requests . Freddy 's indifference to what was expected of him made her feel as though she had to attend to duties and uphold traditions for them both . She knew how disappointed her father was in his son , and she felt she had to make it up to him somehow . And in fact , Christianna was much more like her father , and was always interested in his projects , particularly those involving indigent people in underdeveloped countries . She had done volunteer work several times , in poor areas in Europe , and had never been happier than when she did . He explained his latest endeavors to her as she listened to him with interest and commented from time to time . Her ideas on the subject were intelligent and well thought out , he had always had a deep respect for her mind . He only wished his son had her brains and drive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been wasting her time ever since she got home . He had recently suggested that she consider studying law or political science in Paris . It was a way of keeping her busy and challenging her mind , and Paris was close enough to home . She had many relatives there , on her mother 's side , could stay with them , and come home to see him often . Although she would have liked it , even at her age , there was n't even the remotest possibility of her staying in an apartment on her own . She was still mulling over his plan , but she was more interested in doing something useful that would make a difference to other people , than in going back to school . At his father 's insistence , Freddy had graduated from Oxford , and had a master 's degree in business from Harvard , which was of no use to him , given the life he led . Her father would have allowed Christianna to study something more esoteric , if she chose to , though she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was why he thought law or political science would suit her well . His assistant entered the dining room apologetically as they finished coffee , and smiled at Christianna . He was almost like an uncle to her , and had worked for her father during her entire life . Most of the people around them had worked for him for years . " I 'm sorry to interrupt , Your Highness , " the older man said cautiously . " You have an appointment with the finance minister in twenty minutes , and we have some new reports on Swiss currency that I thought you might want to read before you speak with him . And our ambassador to the United Nations will be here to see you at three-thirty . &; Continues ... by Danielle Steel Excerpted by permission .
