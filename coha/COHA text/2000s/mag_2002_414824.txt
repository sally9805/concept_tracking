Extraterrestrial impacts transform Earth 's surface in an instant <p> Most geological processes unfold at less than a snail 's pace . The tectonic plates that cover Earth 's surface slog along , crashing into and sliding over one another at rates of only a few millimeters per year . Over millions of years , however , these unhurried liaisons raise mountain ranges . Wind , rain , and natural chemical erosion gradually rework the mountains into silt , clay , and dissolved minerals . Slowly , this inorganic detritus wends its way to the sea , where it joins a languid rain of dead marine organisms to form thick layers of ocean-floor ooze . <p> Every now and again , however , things happen in a flash . Asteroids , comets , and smaller objects smack into the planet at clips of thousands of kilometers per hour . When this happens , the impacts can gouge sizable holes in Earth 's outer crust . Within milliseconds , rocks at the impact site vaporize . The rapid expansion of this superheated gas blows melted and pulverized material into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seismic vibrations from an impact can create temperatures high enough to melt or demagnetize some rocks in and near the crater . Farther away , the sudden changes in pressure triggered by shock waves shatter and otherwise transform mineral crystals as no other geological process does . <p> Although these planetary bruises and black eyes have significantly shaped the planet 's surface , many have remained hidden . Scientists are taking advantage of the magnetic and gravitational scars of these impacts to identify the sites of the most dramatic bombardments this planet has ever experienced . <p> WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE Many of the smallest objects on a collision course with Earth burn up in the atmosphere before they reach the surface . A meteoroid-an interplanetary object ranging in size from a dust grain up to a mountain-needs to be at least the size of a child 's marble to blaze all the way to Earth 's surface . Anything that survives the fall is , by definition , a meteorite . The kinetic energy of the meteorite when it strikes the ground-a function of the mass of the space rock and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splash it creates . <p> Tiny meteorites are slowed by the atmosphere so much that they simply drop to the ground , sometimes making no more than a dent . When these dark objects fall on frozen , snow-covered terrain , they 're particularly easy to find . Residents of Canada 's Yukon Territory recovered pieces of a rare carbon-rich meteorite soon after it fell in January 2000 ( SN : 4/8/00 , p. 235 ) , and scientists visiting Antarctica routinely use snowmobiles to hunt for the extraterrestrial rocks . <p> More-massive meteoroids are slowed less by air resistance and therefore pack a bigger punch when they land . They typically gouge out classic , bowl-shaped craters . Arizona 's Meteor Crater-also known as Barringer Crater , after the Philadelphia mining engineer who began studying the site in 1902-is the best-preserved terrestrial example of such a so-called simple crater . <p> The impact scar , located about 20 kilometers west of Winslow , Ariz. , was formed nearly 50,000 years ago when an iron-nickel meteorite about 45 meters in diameter punched through the region 's rocky plain . The impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the power of a hydrogen bomb . The sudden collision vaporized the meteorite , pulverized rocks at ground zero , and heaved large blocks of limestone , some the size of small homes , out of a 200-m deep , 1.2-km-diameter hole . That debris formed an elevated rim that still rises above the Arizona plain . <p> On Earth , craters that range up to about 5 km across have this simple structure , says Harrison H. Schmitt , a geologist and retired astronaut who trained at Meteor Crater before walking on the moon during the Apollo 17 mission . <p> Meteoroids larger than 200 m or so across create a different type of impact scar when they slam into Earth , says Thomas Kenkmann , a geologist at Humboldt University in Berlin . These complex craters have a flat floor marked with a central uplift , which typically is either a single or ring peak . This uplift forms as the rocks beneath the deepest portion of the crater floor rebound from the compressive shock of the meteorite 's impact . <p> Complex craters also have terraced rims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crater collapse downward and inward . An analysis of twisted rocks taken from the central uplift of the 7-km-wide Crooked Creek crater in Missouri suggests that this collapse is very quick , says Kenkmann . <p> The roughly 320-million-year-old impact occurred in sediments composed of mineral grains 10 to 100 micrometers in diameter bound into rock . As many as 40 percent of the boundaries between individual grains were fractured , and rock deformation typically took place in bands between 10 and 500 micrometers wide . None of the grains seem to have been stretched before they broke . All these clues point to the crater collapsing in less than 30 seconds , says Kenkmann . His analyses of several complex craters between 5 and 15 km in diameter suggest that their rims collapsed within a minute of the impact . He reports his findings in the March Geology . <p> THE PRESSURE 'S OFF Thick sheets of melted rocks line the bottom of many large meteor craters . Some of these impact melts derive from the kinetic energy of the impact , a large part of which is converted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abrupt stop . However , the sudden excavation of a large crater probably plays a bigger role in forming impact melts , says Schmitt . <p> Rocks lying kilometers deep within Earth are often on the verge of melting but are prevented from doing so by the immense pressure of all the material above them . When meteorites blast that weight away , the pressure in the rocks beneath the crater floor drops precipitously and the underlying minerals melt . The impact melts may not fully cool for hundreds of thousands of years . In the meantime , water from the environment and the heat from the newly exposed rocks can combine to form hydrothermal systems in the heavily fractured rocks in and around the crater . Scientists believe such warm , mineral-rich venues could have played a role in the early development of life on Earth ( SN : 3/9/02 , p. 147 ) . <p> The 200-m-thick impact melts found within an ancient crater surrounding the town of Sudbury in central Ontario are more than a sign of extraterrestrial impact : They 're a treasure trove of minerals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nickel , platinum , and copper are mined from the melts each year , says Richard Grieve , a geologist at Natural Resources Canada in Ottawa . Isotopic analyses show that the metals come from Earth 's crust , not from the meteor that fell from space . Before the impact melts solidified , the deep , thick blend of light silicates and dense metal ores-which did n't mix well with each other-separated into two layers , according to density , just like oil and vinegar do . This ancient segregation makes mining today much easier . <p> The hydrothermal system created by the Sudbury impact also dissolved minerals containing copper and other metals from a broad area and then concentrated them in rich veins . One large outcrop of ore alone holds minerals valued around $100 billion , says Grieve . The economic interest in the area has proven a boon to scientists , who have attained access to deep rock cores originally extracted to determine the best locations to sink mining shafts . <p> Radioactive dating of the melts and the hydrothermal deposits indicates the Sudbury impact occurred about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between 250 and 300 km across , says Grieve . It 's tough to tell because erosion , including the ravages of several ice ages , has scraped away up to 4 km of Earth 's surface from the crater site . That has erased many of the impact 's effects . <p> A somewhat older impact crater provides a deeper view . The Vredefort impact structure , named after the city in South Africa that was built in the center of the ancient bull's-eye , was created by a collision about 2.02 billion years ago . The rocks now at Earth 's surface there were once between 7 and 10 km belowground , says Roger Gibson of the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg . That much overlying material , including all of the crater 's impact melts , has eroded away since the crater formed . However , that loss is science 's gain : The erosion has made it easy for geologists to get samples of rock that formed deep within the crater 's central peak , now a dome of exposed material . <p> Most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 and 5 millimeters across , which matches the grain size for similar rocks in the area . However , rocks found within 5 km of the center of the Vredefort dome typically have grains no more than 100 micrometers across . Because grain size is related to the length of time that the crystal took to grow , Gibson contends that the rocks in the center of the dome experienced a short burst of terrific heat before they rebounded toward Earth 's surface . <p> His analyses indicate that the rocks were between 15 and 20 km below ground , at around 400C , before the impact occurred . Then , during the strike from space , temperatures in the rocks directly beneath the impact briefly rose to between 1,000C and 1,400C , primarily due to intense shock waves . At sites about 25 km from the impact , shock waves had dissipated somewhat , and the rocky material there got only a small boost in temperature , Gibson says . His team 's analyses appear in the May Geology . <p> NEW FINDS , OLD TOOLS Extraterrestrial impacts leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's temperature rises above its so-called blocking temperature , any magnetic fields in the minerals are disrupted and then realign to match the strength and direction of the magnetic fields in the rock 's environment . This phenomenon takes place in molten rocks spewing from volcanoes and undersea ridges , but it also takes place in the wake of meteor strikes . If the magnetic field at the location of an extraterrestrial impact is significantly different from the one in place when those rocks last cooled , then the cosmic bruise will produce magnetic anomalies . <p> Those irregularities can be quite extensive , says Jasper Halekas , a geophysicist at the University of California , Berkeley . He and his colleagues have analyzed data collected from lunar craters during the Apollo moon missions and the more recent Lunar Prospector probe . Those studies show magnetic anomalies that often extend up to several crater radii from an impact site . That finding implicates temperature boosts from seismic shock rather than exposure to vaporized material from the meteorite . The team presented its results last December at a meeting of the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce gravitational anomalies . Even long after an impact scar becomes heavily eroded , the pulverized rock that fills the crater bottom is much less dense than the solid rock from which it 's derived . The precise force of gravity at any location depends , in part , on the density and amount of material in the neighborhood . Impact melts and a central uplift , if any , also can affect local gravitational patterns . <p> Other geological processes can produce magnetic and gravitational anomalies , but when these two hallmarks occur together , or are backed up with other geologic evidence , it 's a strong hint that scientists may have found an ancient impact site . At the meeting in San Francisco , Dallas Abbott and her colleagues at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades , N.Y. , described a possible impact crater southeast of Hawaii . They found two strong magnetic anomalies , possibly related to impact melts , inside an unusually shallow , 150-km-diameter crater that lies in water about 3.8 km deep . <p> The team also found small spherules of glassy material in sediments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranged up to 200 micrometers in diameter , a size characteristic of those produced by meteorites that create craters 55 km or more across . The crater may be uncharacteristically shallow for a couple of reasons , the researchers say . First , the deep water probably cushioned the blow of the meteorite . Also , chemical analyses of the spherules , which are high in potassium and low in silicon , suggest that the impact landed on an undersea mountain rather than flat ocean floor . <p> A group of scientists from the University of South Carolina in Columbia says that they 've used geological anomalies , as well as clues from rock samples , to identify an ancient crater buried beneath the piedmont sediments of their state . A magnetic anomaly about 10 km across is nearly superimposed on a 12-km-diameter gravitational irregularity near the town of Johnsonville , says geologist Christopher D. Parkinson . A 290-m borehole , drilled when other scientists were studying the area 's aquifers , shows that sediments at the proposed impact site are about 275 m thick . The deepest sediments were laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly on top of basement rock that is a little less than 300 million years old . <p> Shocked quartz and other metamorphic changes in the basement rocks indicate the minerals were subjected to the intense pressures and strong seismic waves generated by a meteorite impact , says Parkinson . Some of the changes suggest that temperatures in the rocks rose to at least 1,300C . <p> Other boreholes drilled in the area during the aquifer study were spaced 20 to 50 km apart and , like the Johnsonville borehole , extended all the way to the basement rocks . All these other sediment cores include a layer of volcanic basalt , dozens of meters thick , that was laid down about 200 million years ago . <p> Parkinson suggests that the Johnsonville core does n't contain this basalt because it was blown away by an impact that occurred between 90 million and 200 million years ago . The team is now conducting detailed analyses of the melt glasses in the sediments , which should provide a more specific date for one of the Piedmont 's worst days in the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identified fewer than 200 impact craters on our planet . However , one look at the pockmarked moon-which shares Earth 's orbit around the sun-suggests that many of our planet 's scars have faded or remain hidden . Finding ancient craters and unveiling their geophysical histories will help fill in the blanks of Earth 's continuing story . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : ANCIENT COMPLEXITY - Newfoundland 's Mistastin Lake fills the eroded remnant of a 38-million-year-old crater , shown in this winter image from space .
