Section : Companies , People , Ideas Mark Bulriss could n't pass up the chance to be chief executive of a big company . He got more than what he ever bargained for with Great Lakes Chemical . <p> MARK BULRISS , AN AMATEUR white-water kayak racer , created a little mantra to help him finish strong in grueling hour-long races : " Nothing left , nothing left . " <p> " Just when you think you have nothing left is when you start paddling harder . If you want a chance at winning , you have to cross that finish line totally exhausted , " he says . <p> The mantra has come in mighty handy during Bulriss ' first 18 months as chief executive of Great Lakes Chemical . It 's been anything but smooth paddling . <p> The Great Lakes board recruited him in early 1998 for his stellar resume . An engagingly blunt 47-year-old chemical engineer , Bulriss spent 16 years at GE Plastics and another 4 at AlliedSignal , where he steered the $2 billion ( sales ) polymers division to record operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had been a customer for years . Great Lakes produces bromine-based flame retardants for plastic resins , polymer additives , fine chemicals for drug production and swimming pool chemicals . It should net $140 million this year from sales of $1.5 billion . <p> The company was once a glamour stock . Under the late Emerson Kampen , Great Lakes ' shares rose eightfold between 1987 and 1993 . Kampen gobbled up smaller specialty chemical outfits using the ample cash generated by Octel Associates , a British gasoline lead-additive business . But Kampen , a benevolently dictatorial entrepreneur , did little to develop bench strength or a clear succession plan . After a gruesome skin disease forced Kampen to quit in 1994 , Great Lakes ' management floundered . Return on capital dropped from 22% in 1993 to 13% in 1996 . <p> Bulriss knew it needed work , but the company he inherited was in much worse shape than either he or Wall Street realized . Its new-product cupboard was bare . Separate divisions called on the same customers and few salespeople were paid on commission . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2000 plans in place . It took the company a month just to close the books at quarter 's end . <p> And , after a few weeks on the job , Bulriss caught wind that some employees were engaged in price-fixing discussions with competitors in the bromine business . He went straight to the Justice Department with his evidence . By cooperating with the Feds Bulriss won Great Lakes amnesty from federal criminal prosecution , but attracted two civil suits filed in U.S. district court in Arkansas . More will come . <p> Bulriss ' early high hopes led to disappointed investors . He fed Wall Street some macho goals : 10% sales growth and 15% operating earnings growth , compounded annually through 2001 . So far the company is falling short of both . Analysts are forecasting 6% sales growth and 8% operating earnings growth for 1999 . Far from getting the stock up , Great Lakes is down 12% this year , worse than the flat S &P; Specialty Chemical index . <p> There is one major problem over which Bulriss has little control : Bromine pricing stinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . One-third of its sales come from bromine-based products , especially the flame retardants that keep DVD players from catching fire . The price of Great Lakes ' largest-volume flame retardant , tetrabromobisphenol A , or tetrabrom , is down 15% since last year . European customers want to replace tetrabrom with nonhalogenated , or more ozone-layer-friendly , flame retardants . And archrival Albemarle Corp . just opened a 15,000-metric-ton-a-year bromine plant in Magnolia , Ark. that it claims gives it the low-cost position in the U.S. Prices do n't look to improve anytime soon . <p> Jokes Bulriss morosely , " If there was any price-fixing going on , it sure does n't look like anyone was too good at it . " <p> But the tenacious Bulriss is n't about to just roll over . The reason he took the Great Lakes job , apart from the $3 million signing bonus in cash and stock , was the company 's enviable market positions : world leader in bromine-based flame retardants ; world leader in pool and spa chemicals ; and number two to Ciba Specialty Chemicals in polymer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color and resistant to heat and light . <p> Bulriss wants to build on these positions through acquisitions . Getting big quickly is the key to staying independent amid the merger mania in the chemical industry . " The other voice in the back of my head says $2 billion in two years , $5 billion in five , " says Bulriss . Given Great Lakes ' current size , this is n't likely . But such goals are what spurs on the troops . <p> Thanks to the $300 million received from the spinoff of Octel , Bulriss can shop with one of the most pristine balance sheets in the industry  --  9% net debt to capital ( long-term debt minus cash ) . In August he paid $162 million in cash for FMC Corp . ' s plastic additives division , which brought on some phosphate-based flame retardants to diversify away from bromine . <p> Bulriss wants to be a one-stop shop for additives , rather than just sell commodity items like tetrabrom on price . He is out to convince big resinmakers like GE and Dow Chemical to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color , heat and light requirements into one pellet they can then add to polypropylene for car bumpers . " I tell people half-jokingly that I want us to be the Silicon Valley of chemistry . We 're in the application development business , " says Bulriss . He established a 2001 target of 30% of sales from products developed in the last five years , up from a current 12% . <p> Bulriss also wants to build Great Lakes ' fine chemicals business , which does the increasingly outsourced complex chemical production work for drug companies . European giants such as Ciba , Bayer and Clariant are also keen on consolidating this $15 billion business , so Bulriss may find himself outbid for the best deals . But he scored a coup in May , buying NSC Technologies from Monsanto for $125 million in cash . Another bidder offered $160 million , but Great Lakes promised to keep all of the scientists aboard . NSC is expert at rapid production of chirals , or mirror-image pairs of drug molecules used to quickly determine which do the active therapeutic work and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million in sales , should grow 15% annually , helping Bulriss reach a fine chemicals sales goal of $500 million in three years , up from $200 million today . <p> Bulriss does n't pretend he can transform Great Lakes into a mini-GE . " I do n't have the cash or the bench strength , but I told people on the first day what the name of the game was : growth and productivity , " he says . <p> It helps to hire people who know the drill already . Six veteran Great Lakes officers have been replaced with Bulriss ' former colleagues from GE and AlliedSignal . Mandatory " 360-degree " performance reviews  --  feedback from bosses , peers and underlings  --  are under way for every employee . So too are GE-style exhaustive interrogations , led by Bulriss , of each division chief 's annual operating plan . A largely discretionary bonus system was scrapped in favor of one based on economic value added , which ties managers ' pay to their ability to generate returns above the company 's 11% cost of capital . Bulriss also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managers know all too well . <p> Bulriss has his own show to run , but it has n't been a breeze . " Since I 've gotten here I feel like I 've been running into a headwind , " he says . But he thinks momentum is shifting his way . <p> At 13 times 2000 earnings , some savvy investors think so , too . Louis Simpson , who runs the Geico portfolio at Berkshire Hathaway , bought 4 million shares , or 7% of the company , late last year . <p> Bulriss certainly does n't want to blow it . When Bulriss went to his old boss , Lawrence Bossidy , to break the news he was quitting , he got an unexpected bear hug and this one bit of received wisdom : " Larry asked me , ' Are you sure you can be successful there ? Because you only get one shot as a chief executive . ' " <p> GRAPH : Bad Chemistry : Great Lakes , once a glamour stock , is now just another doggy chemical play .
