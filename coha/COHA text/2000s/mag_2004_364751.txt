The U.S. produces so much corn so cheaply that Americans have become quite clever at inventing uses for it , from fuel to power cars and trucks to the polymers in plastics . But most of all , we eat it . Our cats and dogs eat it . Even the cattle , chicken , hogs and fish that we eat eat it . In the form of high-fructose corn syrup , it is cheaper than sugar and as ubiquitous as advertising . Harvesting about 286 million tons of corn a year is no accident . It 's U.S. industrial policy . <P> But is the obesity epidemic an unintended consequence of that policy ? <P> A no-brainer , say nutritionists . They see a simple progression . As much as 57% of the corn we produce becomes inexpensive animal feed that helps keep meat prices down . But it also makes the meat fattier  --  and consumers fatter  --  than if the animals were fed grass . <P> About 5% of our corn is refined to high-fructose corn syrup , which is cheaper , sweeter and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mix into foods than sugar . Beverage and food manufacturers see that low price as a signal to use the high-fructose cocktail in virtually everything , substituting it for more nutritious ingredients  --  not just for sugar  --  in peanut butter , fruit juices and spaghetti sauce . <P> From 1972 to 2002 , the amount of sugar and syrup produced annually per American grew 21% , from 104 lbs . to 126 lbs. , according to the Department of Agriculture . In that same time period , the percentage of syrup sweetener in that total grew from less than 1% to nearly 50% . <P> But corn refiners say it 's a mistake to blame their products for obesity . They note that in countries that consume almost none of the syrup , such as Mexico and Russia , obesity is still a problem . Corn growers and refiners also insist that the body treats sugar and high-fructose corn syrup identically , an argument that has recently been challenged by scientists studying sugar metabolism at the molecular level . <P> So the question is trickier than it seems . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $20 billion a year  --  that 's not likely to change anytime soon . Besides , corn is so cheap that even a farm policy that doubled the crop 's price might make only a marginal difference in grocery-store prices . <P> To discourage consumption of what they see as unhealthy corn products , food activists have proposed a variety of measures , from junk-food taxes to tough labeling laws . Michael Jacobson , executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest , says even something as simple as labeling products as healthy or  --  in the case of highly sweetened carbonated beverages  --  as unhealthy would help consumers make better food choices . <P> Soft-drink makers and the corn growers whose products sweeten them will mightily resist anything that threatens to come between them and their consumers . But the nutrition activists believe that the wind may be shifting their way . " The soda-pop industry is more powerful than we are , " Jacobson says . " But the obesity epidemic has a power of its own . "  --  By Eric Roston   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
