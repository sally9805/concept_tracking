The kit home was introduced in 1908 by Sears Roebuck , with the parts shipped by railcar . Price : $1,500 to $1,800 for the popular bungalow style . " An ideal cottage for a summer home , " proclaimed the catalog copy . Since then generations of architects have taken a crack at improving on the kit concept . Among the most recent are Douglas Gauthier and Jeremy Edmiston of SYSTEMarchitects in New York City . Their take is called the Parish House , and a century after Sears , they used computer design and manufacturing . The result : a three-bedroom , two-bath , 1,000-sq. - ft. bungalow that costs $184,000 and whose structural system consists of 1,100 pieces of laser-cut plywood . Each piece is different . There are no posts , no beams  --  and no nails . The plywood is woven together to form the building 's structural web and held together by a series of stainless-steel fasteners . <P> The Parish House has a complex geometry that defies traditional housing-construction methods . Its design was made possible through computer modeling . The pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its role , then extracted those pieces from the model and numbered them . With another program , the pieces are arranged on plywood sheets to maximize use of the wood . " We save a lot of waste that way , " says Gauthier . And a lot of time . The boards can be cut locally and shipped to the site on two flatbed trucks . No railcars needed .
