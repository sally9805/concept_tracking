THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY Checking the dirt-streaked window , Mary saw the little boys slipping around through the woods again . They were sneaking from tree to tree , hiding . Today they had their rifles with them . She let her pottery wheel die and stomped outside . The boys were brothers , and they lived two houses down the road . Their small white house appeared to be barricaded , with its hedge of oil drums and chicken crates . " What are you boys up to now ? " she said , rubbing her clayey hands with an old dish towel . They beamed at her with calculated innocence . " Do you need us to kill you some snakes ? " Jeb , the older one , asked , fixing her with a sly Humphrey Bogart gaze . He was about ten . " No . What do you want to kill my snakes for ? " " They might get in your clubhouse , " the smaller one said . His name was Abe . He was freckled like an old blue  --  enameled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jeb said , tossing his head . He was talking about her pottery studio , the little shed tacked on to a storage barn . She spent all her time there , throwing pots . She did n't have time for little boys or anything else considered normal around here-cooking , TV , church . She was sure these boys had picked all her daffodils the week before . " Do you need us to kill you any groundhogs ? " Jeb said . " I have n't seen any groundhogs . " " It 's a dollar-fifty for a groundhog , ten dollars for a snake , " the younger one said . Jeb shifted his rifle . He said , " Abe specializes in snakes . I 'm after foxes , but ai n't many of them . And the coyotes are whomping all the groundhogs . " " I do n't need you little boys around here , " Mary said , hiking her coveralls up . " Do n't you have anything that needs killing ? " Abe said . " We can help you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need your help , " Mary said . She motioned toward the " clubhouse . " " Do n't let me catch you messing around there . " Pointing their rifles ahead , they disappeared behind the barn , where they encountered a padlocked door . " What 's in there ? " Jeb asked when she reached the boys . " That 's where my ovens are , " Mary said with a dangerous grin . " My ovens are so hot they would melt those guns of yours . Now , do n't let me catch you fooling around here , or I 'll shut you in my ovens . " We ai n't scared , " Jeb said . " Do n't you know what happened to Hansel and Gretel ? " she asked . Their blank faces said no . " That 's pathetic , " she said . " Do n't your parents teach you anything ? " She was certain these boys had killed the birds she kept finding scattered throughout the woods . Earlier in the month she had found a pile of songbirds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had gathered for a songfest and sung themselves to death . The next day , from the kitchen window , she saw the boys sneaking out from behind the barn . Yanking along a small wagon , they skidded into a mound of dirt she had recently had delivered and began digging . She had gotten the dirt to fill in a place where an old outhouse site was sinking , but it had been dumped ten yards away from the hole . A latticework of roots covered the depression in the ground . Again she rushed out to face the boys . " What are you doing ? " she barked . " Quit messing in my dirt . " She paused to collect herself , but then blurted anyway , " I know what you boys did to my flowers . You 're thieves and vandals . " She pointed to the picked patch , a few yards away . She imagined the daffodils still nodding their heads , as if in a reflex action . " We want to work , " Jeb said . Their sincere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The younger one was pudgy , with sandy hair snipped in a line across the middle of the back of his head , as though he 'd had a run-in with a bush hog . He said , " We need to help out at home , " cause Mama 's lost her job and has to get oddities . " " That ai n't it , Abe . It 's com-oddities , " Jeb said slowly . " Cheese and sacks of no-count stuff , " Abe said , making a face . " What are you doing with my dirt ? " Mary asked . Their wagon had some of the new dirt in it . " We was going to help you move it-fill in that hole . " Jeb was suddenly a funny sight , the way he was acting-like an experienced building contractor . Mary studied the boys closely . Getting help had been hard since she inherited this unmanageable property from her uncle . She was busy with pots . She had orders to fill for her customers spring catalogue , and she had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been falling when she moved in , the previous October . She had n't raked or mowed . She knew the frontage had to be kept clear or she 'd be fined , but the point held no urgency for her . The barn was full of machinery that she had not troubled herself to use . Recently Mrs. Hayes , a neighbor down the road , had dropped by to chat and snoop . She said , " Your uncle always cleaned out the woods and picked up the limbs and kept it mowed like a park . But you 've got all them flowerpots and sandbags . That 's not how your uncle kept this place . " Mary , instantly spiteful , thought of the woman as the Nasty-Nice Neighbor , but she took out an ad in the paper for a yard man . One fellow said he would come and mow the woods , but he never came . Another took the job , raked leaves for two hours , and then went home with a headache . He called later to say that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman called and accused her of running a sexist ad . Mary dropped the ad . Sometimes she just did n't think , she told herself . Most of the time she just did n't think . She had to focus on one thing at a time . She was here in Kentucky , not in Santa Fe . She had to make pots , fill orders . She had abandoned everything else , on the advice of Henry Thoreau , who said , " Simplify , simplify , " and Henry Ford , who said , " Simplicate , then add lightness . " Ford was speaking about his formula for airplanes , but his idea would apply to anything , she thought . Photograph // When she had visited here as a little girl , the shed was her playhouse . She played in these woods , where these boys now explored . The woods were thick then , shielding the outhouse from the road . One year when she came back to visit , Uncle Bob and Aunt Reba had a new bathroom with lime-green imitation tiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Well , maybe I could use your help , " Mary said to the boys . They wore baggy jeans and had their baseball caps on backwards . Their little red wagon was rusty , and in one end it had yellow scum and wads of dotted comic books . " We can weed-eat , " Jeb said to Mary . " We weed-eated our fencerow yesterday , " Abe said . " Mama said we done it good . " " Let 's just fill in the hole , " Mary told them . " It 's where an old outhouse used to be , and it 's falling in . I want to fill it where the tree roots are showing . " " We need us a dump truck , " Abe said solemnly . Maybe his hair had been trimmed with a weed-eater , Mary thought . " Do you know what an outhouse is ? " she asked . They shook their heads . " I 'll bet you 've never seen one . " Their faces lacked all curiosity . She might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitement " All right " she said to the boys . " If you can move that dirt and fill in this hole this afternoon , I 'll pay you five dollars . " " Ten , " Jeb said . " There 's two of us . Five dollars apiece . " She grunted an okay . The boys got to work . She watched them from the clubhouse , where she was shaping a medium-size pot . Her pots were simple and functional , not like the useless multitextured art pieces she used to make out in Santa Fe . She had OD 'd on artiness-all moonshine and selfishness , she decided . Her pieces had been no better than the glitter  --  dusted ceramic frogs and elves Aunt Reba had collected . Now she supplied plain pots to a mail-order company that sold them as bread-loaf bakers with recipes . She had tried baking bread in one of them , but it seemed a silly and clumsy thing to do . Every few minutes she glanced up to check on the boys . What an odd pair they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke like old men . Concentrating on the spinning mud was hard while the boys were there . She gave up and went outside . She began burning leaves in the trash barrel . Then the boys came up behind her , startling her . " You ca n't burn till four-thirty , " Jeb said . " When the wind dies down . " " Is this any of your business ? " Mary asked , heaving leaves into the flames . " They 'll get you . They fly over in helichoppers a-looking for people burning . " " And they look for Mary-Juanita , " the little one said . " How do you know that ? " " Daddy said . " " How much dirt have you boys moved ? I 'm not paying you for Sunday-school lessons . " " We need your riding mower to pull our wagon , so it 'll be faster . " " That 's silly . " " We can make twice as many loads . " The idea tempted her . She could get the mower out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's two-hour visit . A two-hour yard man ought to be twice as good as a sixty-minute man , she thought remembering the raunchy old song . She had always thought it should be the theme song for 60 Minutes . Her mind was flying around loose . She was suddenly eager to look at the equipment in the barn . She went indoors for the key to the barn . Uncle Bob and Aunt Reba 's decrepit old house resembled an antiques mall , with random collections of grimy old stuff . Mary had cleared out a couple of rooms for her needs and crammed the bric-a-brac into the other rooms . She shoved away the needlepoint pillows , the artificial flowers , the Coca-Cola memorabilia-Bob and Reba 's lifetime . The boys followed her to the barn . Abe was dragging a tobacco stick . With another stick Jeb was whipping at bushes . " Leave those bushes alone , " she said . " They 'll bloom soon , and you 're not going to pull their heads off when they do . " She opened the barn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , several mowers , a riding lawn tractor , and a three-wheeled all-terrain vehicle . " Wow , " Jeb said . " A three-wheeler ! " " Gah , " Abe said . His mouth hung open . She set them to work with the riding mower , but before long they were back again , bursting right through her clubhouse door . She was about to spin off a pot . She kept working with fierce concentration . " You need to get that three-wheeler out and ride it some , " Jeb said . " No , I believe not . " The pottery wheel slowed to a whisper . " It 'll rust out if you do n't ride it . " Abe said , " I want to ride it . " " Have you got that dirt moved ? " The pot gleamed , shiny and fresh . " We need that three-wheeler , " Jeb said . " It 'll pull that wagon better . " " One tire 's flat , " she said . " We 've got a pump at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vague nod for a yes and went flying home . She loaded some pots into a crate to carry to the kiln . She liked the way she could bake something into place . She liked the illusion of permanence in something as fragile as pottery . In a few minutes she saw the boys coming through the woods with a pump . They had entered the barn and pumped up the tire of the three-wheeler by the time she reached them . Jeb had the gas cap off and was feeling inside the tank with his fingers . " It 's good to go , " he cried . She thought how satisfying it would be to take a willow switch to these boys . Jeb said excitedly , " Our papaw said he ai n't seen none of these three-wheelers since heck was a pup . " " Papaw 's at our house , " Abe said . " He sleeps all day , but be woke up and got us the pump . " " I do n't have a key to this thing , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ button , " Jeb said . He was already starting it up . " If we hook it up to the wagon , we can pull the dirt a lot faster . " " We 're good workers , " Abe said . " We 're worky-holics . " They were already driving off , like a bus pulling away without seeing her signal . Abe held on behind Jeb . The three-wheeler was buckjumping . She ran along behind them to the pile of dirt . " You 've got too much dirt " Jeb said . " We need to take some down to the creek down there . " He pointed beyond some bushes to a small creek on her boundary . Even in April it was only a trickle . " If we had a bale of hay we could load it on the wagon and we could ride it down there and make us a dam , " Jeb said . Mary shook her head . " If you dam that up , you 'll flood the whole bottom . " Jeb said , " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good dam . " " They could make it with sticks , " Abe said . " And trees . " " We could catch some fish if we had a pond , " Jeb said . " We could catch some beavers , too , if there was a dam . " " Now , do n't you go damming that up , " Mary said calmly , as if they were having a reasonable discussion . " I have n't seen any beavers , and if you dam up the creek , Mr. Smith 's pond over yonder will dry up and we 'll have a pond here . That 's like stealing somebody 's pond . " She saw the gleam in Jeb 's eyes jump like an electric spark over a synapse to his brother 's eyes . She said , " Now go on and finish spreading that dirt like I hired you to . " She went back to her work . She had to spin another set of pots . She cut the day and slapped it angrily on the table . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pit where the outhouse had been , because of the tree roots , but if they did , it was their own fault . They were pestering her . She slapped the day down again . She pumped the wheel and helped the mud spin into shape . The boys were moving dirt . They wanted to make a dam . Making a dam would be like making a clay pot . Had they really said the three  --  wheeler would rust out if it was n't ridden ? She shivered . She thought about the last time she had had sex . Her doctor said that regular sex kept the tissues healthy . Mary looked out the window at the woods . It was full of boys-at least a dozen of them , all sizes . A raggedy-haired one was driving the three-wheeler pell-mell through the bumpy woods . The boys whooped and squealed . The woods reverberated with their ruckus . The dead birds suddenly jolted her mind . She could imagine the pile of bluebirds and robins , their decomposing bodies clustered as if they bad come together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if it were happening on TV . She went inside the house to the bathroom . She was startled to see a vague hag in the mirror . She thought she should try a mudpack on her face . She had plenty of clay for it . There ought to be a glazing technique to preserve the face . The telephone rang . " I 've seen what 's going on in your woods , " the Nasty  --  Nice Neighbor said . " I 'm afraid those little boys are going to get hurt . " " I 'm watching them , " Mary said impatiently . " Bob Burney used to let the boys around the neighborhood ride that three-wheeler , but then they passed a law against those things . Did n't you know that ? What if one of them little boys gets hurt ? Have you lost your mind ? " " Are you going to call the police ? " Mary shot back . " Why do n't you have us all arrested ? " " I do n't want to fool with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ca n't trust them . " " How do you know I did n't give that three-wheeler to those boys ? " Mary said . " If they own it , then what they do with it is their responsibility . " " Well , I was just calling to let you know somebody might get hurt and they 'll sue you to kingdom come . I do n't like to meddle , but I figured I 'd call you instead of the police . I would never call the police . That 's not how we do things around here . " Mary slammed down the telephone . Her muddy handprint wrapped the receiver like a sleeve . The three-wheeler was headed for the creek . A skinny , dark-haired boy was driving , and he was picking up speed . The machine bucked and snorted . The rest of the boys were running , trying to catch him . They jumped the creek with him , splashing through the shallow water . The boys were all yelling and shrieking , clamoring for rides . She had n't realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But why should she know such a thing anyway ? She realized now that if they were illegal , buying or selling them was also probably illegal . She had counted on getting some money eventually from the yard equipment . She shivered at the cold possibility that if she were angry enough , she could let a kid get hurt . The mud on her hands was caking dry , drawing her skin taut . The leaf fire was almost out . The smoke had turned in her direction . If she hollered , the boys would n't hear her-the wind was wrong . They were n't listening anyway . She was just a strange , unkempt woman baying at the wind . In another setting she would be taken for a bag lady . The bag part would be easy . Aunt Reba had saved paper grocery bags , a thousand bundles of them . " Let me show you how to drive this thing , " she said when she reached the boys . They surrounded her-hard little bodies , steamy and dirty , all in droopy clothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I can ride this thing like a broomstick . Remember that scene in E. T ? The bicycles in the sky ? Do you realize what witches can do on a contraption like this ? " Jeb shoved the dark-haired boy off the seat and let Mary take it . " That would be funny , to see you ride , " Jeb said , with his Humphrey Bogart manner . " Come on , y'all . Let her ride . " Let 's see the dame give it a whirl . " She might take off on it , and we 'd never see it again : , " one of the boys said with a worried pout . " Is she really a witch ? " a boy with a burr-cut asked Jeb . The burr-cut boy 's T-shirt read SEVEN DAYS WITHOUT PRAYER MAKES ONE WEAK . " Witch is n't even the half of it , " she said . She straddled the three-wheeler , grabbed the handles , and tested them . She aimed at a line of open-mouthed boys , little pups who jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tricycle across the bumpy ground through the trees . She passed the stump where the bluebirds and robins lay heaped like Jonestown victims . Skirting the outhouse hole , she shifted into a higher gear , and then one still higher . She drove the three-wheeler out into the road , picked up speed , and waved good-bye . As she rode , she dreamed about David McAllister 's Harley , how she had mounted it behind him and they thundered down a dark country road rimmed by low natural walls of red rock . It was in the spring of 1983 , in New Mexico . She hugged his hard stomach and smelled his back , her face on his seasoned leather . She recalled that night on the motorcycle with vividness , as if she were seeing a movie in her head . There she was , riding snugly behind him , feeling unafraid and buoyant and blessed with youth . Earlier she had heard the Harley growl to a halt outside her house , and David came in carrying a dozen hot tamales wrapped in newspaper . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup of coffee left in that morning 's pot . She asked about his dog , who had run away . He was happy , because his dog had come back . She was happy because he was happy . The grease from the hot tamales smeared the kitchen table , where they sat for a long while , falling in love . And then they went for the night ride through the canyon , undulating with the road . When she saw him for the last time , he was in a hospital in a cloud of cocaine . She said good-bye to him , but he did n't hear her . She drove west on Route 40 . The hue and texture of that cloud around him seemed to be projected out onto the giant scrub-board sky . It was as though his mind were spewing waste against the blue vault . He always used the word " waste . " He could have been an architect , she thought . He saw all landscapes as constructions  --  the vistas and lines of rocks and sand and scrub and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't keep loving someone who would squander the sky itself . That was the last time she had let herself be in love . He was only one small event in her past , one of those unmanageable pieces of her life that she had swept under the road as if it were a rug , and now here she was in Kentucky , looking for road signs . But she was still riding that Harley . She remembered seeing by the side of the road , in the bike 's swooping light , an owl the size of a small child . It revolved its head and rose-with marvelous , slow grace-into the blank night . // <p>
