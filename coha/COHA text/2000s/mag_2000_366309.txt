When Jim Barksdale started school in Jackson , Miss. , he had trouble learning to read . In the third grade he still stumbled over simple words . So his parents got him a private tutor , and that changed his life . He became a good student and later an exceptional corporate leader . When he sold Netscape , he pocketed $700 million . Last week he brought a big chunk of that money back to his home state . <P> Barksdale , 56 , and his wife Sally gave $100 million to their alma mater , the University of Mississippi , to promote reading in the state that ranks last in literacy ( a third of its adults ca n't read a sports story or a map ) . The couple 's donation will provide every child from kindergarten through Grade 3 with the sort of help with reading that got Barksdale launched . <P> Their gift indicates that the expanding ranks of tech millionaires are outgrowing their reputation for stinginess . Following the lead of Microsoft 's Bill Gates and wife Melinda , who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more technology moguls are making serious commitments to philanthropy . As the Barksdales show , many are using an entrepreneurial approach  --  hands-on , well informed , demanding  --  to make sure their gifts are used effectively . <P> Jim and Sally Barksdale had been thinking about ways they could promote literacy in Mississippi . Richard Thompson , the state superintendent of education , says he read about the Barksdales ' interest in a newspaper , " so I called Jim up . " After long conversations , a joint venture was created between Ole Miss , the state department of education and seven other state universities . The effort , says Barksdale , will attack illiteracy " at the source , " in the early grades . It will also teach illiterate parents to read , so they can help their kids . <P> Like any good executive , Barksdale insists on accountability from those implementing his program . " If we do n't see an improvement in five years , we 'll move the endowment , " he says . " It gives an incentive for everyone involved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
