" Dear Mr. Van Gelder , <p> " I 'm looking at all these science fiction writers in Locus and all I can think is ... everyone appears overweight , pasty-skinned , saggy-faced , rummy-eyed , just plain tired .... " <p> - Letter to the editor , name withheld <p> " Anxious to avoid obesity ? Do n't make any major lifestyle changes . Instead , eat 100 fewer calories or burn 100 more a day .... To burn around 100 calories ... swim for 10 minutes ... ride your bike for 20 minutes ... make love for an hour ... " <p> - Elizabeth Large , The Baltimore Sun <p> THE PHONE rang , but I let the machine take the call . The doorbell sounded , but even though I was expecting a FedEx package containing the galley of my new novel , The Qubit Quandary , I ignored the summons . The clock showed half past one , well beyond the hour when I once used to quit work to watch my favorite soap opera , The Anguish and the Sorrow , but I resolutely kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my quota of words and miles for the day , before the arrival of the woman from the Science Fiction Writers of America 's Consort Bureau . <p> Strapped into the harness of my special exercycle that left my hands free to type on the laptop computer mounted between the handlebars , I pumped my legs while frantically composing . Sweat dripped off my chin onto the keyboard , but luckily the computer was a surplus military model hardened against such distress . As words flickered into being on the screen , the bike 's odometer racked up the final mileage toward my morning exercise goal . Huffing and puffing , I managed to type the last word of a chapter just as the little LED readout showed ten miles . <p> Wearily , I let my legs come to a rest , saved the file , and powered down both bike and computer . ( The telemetry on my exercise had already been automatically forwarded to SFWA . ) I unbuckled myself and climbed off . A jug of Gatorade beckoned , and I grabbed it to swig down about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and neck when the doorbell rang once more . Damn ! I had hoped to have time for a solitary shower , but it was not to be . I glanced at the clock , saw it was now two , and cursed once more the unvarying promptness of the SFWA Consort service . <p> I went to the door , towel around my shoulders , sweaty track suit clinging to my chest and legs . My mind was still swirling with complications of my narrative-in-progress , thoughts of tomorrow 's writing . All in all , I felt about as ready for sex as a soggy dill pickle . <p> Dana stood smiling pleasantly , albeit a tad mechanically , on my doorstep . I did n't know her last name , since the Consorts were not allowed to give out that information . She was an attractive young woman with blonde hair in a pageboy cut , freckles across her nose , and a fine , ripe figure . <p> " Dana , what a surprise . I have n't seen you in six months . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in SFWA 's Western Region , but now I 'm back East and assigned to you . No personal motivations at all behind my absence . May I come in , please ? The clock is ticking . " <p> I repressed a sigh . " Certainly . " <p> It was a warm day and Dana wore no coat . Once inside , she began efficiently to unbutton her blouse . She soon had it off , revealing the requisite rocket-imprinted bra which Victoria 's secret crafted exclusively for SFWA . She was unzipping her skirt to disclose her matching panties when she realized I was not making any comparable moves . She stopped undressing and looked at me with puzzlement . <p> " What 's the problem ? Oh , you need a shower . Well , we can certainly have one together , although as you must know , regulations allow only five point five minutes for that activity . " <p> " Dana , forget the shower right now . " <p> She regarded me closely . " Are you feeling sick ? If you have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuddling . " <p> " No , I 'm not sick , and I do n't have a doctor 's excuse . It 's just - Well , Dana , do we have to make love today ? Could n't we just - oh , I do n't know - sit and talk ? " <p> Dana assumed a reproachful , monitory look . " You know darn well that 's not what I 'm getting paid for . I 'm here to insure that you burn off one hundred calories , so that you can stay trim and fit and continue to produce bestsellers . This service is corning out of your SFWA dues , after all . Twenty thousand a year is n't pocket change , even for someone with your income . Do n't you want maximum value for your money ? " <p> " Naturally , but - " <p> " Was our lovemaking last time unsatisfactory in terms of metabolic stimulation rates ? If so , you should have filled out Form **27;1099;TOOLONG . But barring that , I 'm afraid that the terms of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each and every day of the week . " <p> " Yes , yes , I know all that . But I was just hoping - " <p> Dana glowered at me . " Hoping what ? That perhaps you could suborn me from my duties ? Perhaps with a bribe ? I 'm truly disappointed in you . Do you really think so little of me and my office ? I 'm not just some dumb bimbo , you know . May I remind you that we Consorts , male and female , are not your typical amateur escorts of old . We all belong to a guild of dedicated sexual therapists , whose only vital interests are the well-being of their clients . That 's why we won the contract from SFWA , after all . And believe me , it was a tight race against Sisters in Crime . " <p> " I understand all that . But could n't I just promise to swim an extra ten minutes at the Y tonight instead ? " <p> " You know that 's not an option either - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **25;1128;TOOLONG . And I should warn you that approval of this form generally takes from nine to fifteen months . When choosing allowed activities and permissable exclusions , you signed up originally for hiking , love-making , and skipping that morning doughnut you used to enjoy . Substitution in any of those categories is not condoned . " <p> " But it 's just that the lovemaking - " <p> Dana frowned , then suddenly looked ready to cry . " It 's me , specifically , is n't it ? I do n't match your erotic criteria anymore , do I ? It 's only three extra pounds , you know . And I 'm working hard to lose it . Well , the SFWA Bylaws certainly permit you to choose an alternate escort . Just let me get the sample book out of my car - " <p> I grabbed Dana 's wrist as she turned , heedless of her semi-topless state , to go outside and retrieve the book of escorts . " No , Dana , you 're as attractive as ever . It 's just that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity into something of a chore for me . I mean , it seemed like a good idea at the time I first signed up , but now it 's often just drudgery . " <p> " Well , certainly it 's a chore . It 's just one more of your writerly responsibilities , a regular complement to your chosen lifestyle , yet perhaps the most important task - next to the actual writing , of course . " She cocked her head querulously and somewhat frightenedly . " You 're not advocating a return to the bad old days , are you ? " <p> " Oh , no , of course not ! " <p> " That 's good . Otherwise I 'd have to report you . And you know the financial penalties for advocating overthrow of SFWA 's Physical Fitness Amendment . The organization ca n't allow matters to retrogress to that horrid state they were in just ten years ago . Why , it 's hard to imagine that such conditions ever existed . Writers who were slothful , self-indulgent , shamefully out of shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and horror writers were regarded as wheezing geeks , spavined mouse-potatoes and cellulite-pocked nebbishes , unable to command their fair share of media attention . They all were ! That image proved to be the main reason why those genres could never command more than a certain limited slice of market-share . The writers were simply perceived as too unhealthy and unattractive . In competition with Jackie Collins , Paul Auster , Zadie Smith and their ilk , the genre writers just could n't hold their own in the mediasphere . " <p> I had n't counted on Dana being such a SFWA flack , or on getting a history lesson from her . But I endured her speech as being preferable to the lovemaking . The clock was already running down on our session . <p> " The field should have recognized all of this long ago , since they had certain breakout successes such as those hotties Jonathan Lethem and Neil Gaiman . And even the case of hunky Kim Stanley Robinson and his massive sales , while occurring within the genre , pointed the way . But instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stan 's author photos or the thrilling news of his hiking exploits but in reading about stinky old Mars ! But once the blinders fell away , it was only a short path to a complete reversal of affairs . And now , ten years later , the majority of SFWA 's trim , pumped , and buffed members appear regularly on bestseller lists , talk shows , and reality programs . Why , the latest series of Who Wants to Many an SF Writer ? was rated number one last month ! And this is the paradise on Earth that you and your selfishness are intent on destroying ! " <p> Dana 's pretty face had grown flushed during her tirade , and I had to confess that I was finding her more attractive by the minute , recalling previous sessions with her when I had been more in the mood . What had I been thinking ? Surely this was n't too high a price to pay for all my worldly success . And what right did one writer have to compromise the fiscal well-being of his peers ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Okay , baby , you 've convinced me . Let 's go to the bedroom . " <p> Dana checked her watch . " I 'm sorry , but there 's not enough time now . I have to be with one of the local Grandmasters in an hour . He 's appearing on the cover of Modern Maturity and needs me as arm candy . But if you fill out Form Bee-ex-seven-six-four , we can do it twice tomorrow . " <p> IMG
