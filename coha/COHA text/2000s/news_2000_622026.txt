<p> This is the second installment in a three-part series on Mill Valley Little League 's season . <p> Little League mom Hilary Hyde had it from the crack of the bat  --  a towering pop foul she bare-handed from her grandstand seat with the aplomb of a veteran . <p> Strictly a routine catch for any Mill Valley parent attending one of their youngsters ' Little League games at Boyle Park . <p> These people are seasoned baseball nuts . <p> " I 'm ready to suit up and play , " Hyde , a 20-year resident of Mill Valley , said as she triumphantly held the ball aloft . " There 's no better way to spend a Saturday afternoon than watching Mill Valley Little League . I 've been to Pac Bell Park , and I 'd much rather watch my son Alex play baseball than Barry Bonds . " <p> Her son , Alex Grande , is a 12-year-old right fielder for the Padres . When asked what he thought about his mom 's notions of joining the team , he said all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great catch , " he said , grinning . " If mom thinks she 's ready to play hardball , then that 's cool with me . " <p> Clearly , everyone wants in on the fun . Mill Valley Little League offers some of the best free baseball action in the North Bay . <p> The back-to-back diamonds at Boyle Park are a shrine to the national pastime . Here , the game is nurtured like a freshly planted infield . Young talent is brought along slowly and with care . <p> Like baseball itself , Boyle Park has no clock . Time seems to stand still in reverence of the game . Beaver Cleaver could grab a mitt and play here without seeming out of place . <p> The smell of barbecue hovering over the park gives only a hint of the treats waiting at the snack bar . Some of the most popular items are the crispy chicken nuggets and fries . <p> Sure , they have coffee . But this is Marin  --  you can also get a latte or espresso . <p> Some of the players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring treats right to the dugout . <p> Behind the center-field fence , an old-fashioned scoreboard marks the passing innings . Younger kids are usually recruited to hang the wooden numbers on hooks to indicate runs , innings and outs . On a recent Thursday evening , two 5-year-olds were too short to hang the digits on the uppermost hooks , so no outs were recorded , and the space remained blank . <p> No one really seemed to care . <p> Sitting in the stands , shoulder-to-shoulder with parents and siblings , you feel their hopes and frustration ebb and flow . A constant baseball chatter fills the air , giving voice to the never-ending hustle . After a well-fought inning , a mom from the winning team might cross over into the opposing bleachers to comfort a friend on the losing side . <p> Andrea Zanko , whose husband coaches the Reds and their son , Jesse , explained the reasoning behind her visit to the Padres side of the field . The Reds were soundly beating the Padres , who had yet to win a single game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " These are our boys , and we want them all to feel good about themselves , " Zanko said . " It does n't really matter what team they play for  --  we just want them to have a smile on their faces . " <p> In Mill Valley Little League , everyone seems to keep their sense of humor about the game . Kathy King was hand-sewing a silk garter belt for her daughter 's upcoming performance of " Guys and Dolls " when her son , Kenny Cahill , ripped a solid single . <p> " Kenny is usually a sacrifice , " she laughed . " He seems to bunt in almost every game , because the guy in front of him is always on base . It was great to see him actually hit the ball . <p> " I find it relaxing to sit here . People who live around Boyle Park love to come and watch the games . " <p> Just like in the real majors , the Yankees are dominating this league . Led by ace pitcher and slugger Aaron Raff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them a grand slam ) , the Yankees have yet to lose . At 8-0 , they 're cruising toward the playoffs . <p> REALLY CONNECTING <p> There 's something pure and empowering about getting into a pristine uniform and putting on a show for your friends and family . <p> Mill Valley Little League is a form of theater , where the players and coaches act out a baseball drama for a devoted audience . And there 's nothing shoddy or second-rate about this performance . The players all wear uniforms that would make any major-leaguer proud . <p> The kids look and feel sharp . <p> Greg Rosso , 12 , who plays first base for the Marlins , has been in Mill Valley Little League since the age of 5 . He is well aware of the fans rooting for him from the stands . <p> " I love playing on the Marlins , " Rosso said . " The vibes on this team are good . Soccer is more active  --  but when you make a great play or get a hit here at Boyle Park , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents showing up to watch the ballgames and share the experience , the kids feel noticed . Baseball gives them the attention they need to gain confidence in themselves . <p> Tim Grayson , who has continued to coach the major division Marlins even after his own two sons grew too old to play , feels the rewards of the game are clear for all to see . <p> " Just watching the face of a kid getting his first hit is great , " he said . " They all learn to pull for each other and become a team . It does n't matter if you 're the best hitter or not . By the time the kids reach the Little League majors , they 're here because they really want to play ball . A lot of kids have been eliminated before they get to this level . " <p> And for good reason . By the time the kids reach 11 and 12 years old , the pitchers are throwing blazing fastballs and nasty breaking pitches . Grounders are scooped up with grace . Fielders face balls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> These kids can play some ball . <p> Most have survived years of baseball 's hard knocks and are starting to show some real polish . Many have played in organized baseball since the age of 5 and have come up through the rookie , star and minor divisions . <p> They have learned their baseball skills through dedicated coaching and years of practice . <p> Zio Ziegler , 12 , was thrilled this year when he was drafted by the Marlins . Grayson is a popular coach , and Ziegler wanted to learn the game from him . <p> " Coach Grayson is a great coach , " he said . " I have a lot of respect for him . I 'm not the best player on the team  --  but he 's given me some good tips that have really helped my game . " <p> All the men and women who commit time to Mill Valley Little League take the job seriously . They want their players to get the most they can out of playing the game well . <p> But they also want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the pitching coach for the Reds , feels that pitching makes the difference . <p> " I 'd say pitching is about 75 percent of the game at this level , " Evans said . " Naturally , the pitcher is n't going to strike out every batter , you still need strong defensive skills . But in the majors , it 's a real big part of the game . <p> " A pitcher that can keep it low and keep the batters off-balance is going to win . At this age , players are beginning to move the ball around with command . I do n't teach curves myself  --  but my pitchers do throw offspeed . " <p> Taylor Swift , 11 , like his father before him , has taken up the craft of catching . He thinks nothing of having hardballs flung at him inning after inning . Without much coaxing , he pulls up the sleeves of his Marlins jersey to reveal some colorful bruises . <p> " I got hit with three different pitches today , " he said . " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't feel all that good  --  but I 've been catching since the minors , and I like it . My dad got his nose broken catching  --  so this is nothing . " <p> PROPER ATTITUDE <p> In baseball they call them " hot dogs "  --  and no , we 're not talking about the ones you get from the snack bar . <p> They are the players who draw attention to themselves rather than doing what 's best for the team . Showboats are n't popular in Mill Valley Little League . And , often , they end up cooling their cleats on the bench . <p> Judy Raff , whose son , Aaron , plays on the division-leading Yankees , likes to keep the whole thing in perspective . <p> " I have a philosophy about Little League , " she said . " I want my son to be a good team player . But I also want him to be a role model . I think it 's important to put good sportsmanship first . " <p> One of the ways the boys of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls who play alongside them . <p> Jenny Lloyd and Rachel Sibbitt , both 11-year-olds , are the only girls who currently play in the Mill Valley major division . Jenny says she rarely has any problems with boys teasing her or not wanting her to play . This is her first year in the majors  --  but she was an all-star in her two previous years in the minors as both a pitcher and a catcher . <p> " The boys on my teams do n't treat me any different , " Jenny said after a recent game in which she donned catcher 's gear and spent the afternoon digging fastballs out of the dirt . <p> " Sometimes guys on the other team will say stuff like , Look at that girl on their team . ' But then I get on the pitcher 's mound and strike them out , and that makes them sort of quiet . " <p> The best way for any player , boy or girl , to earn the respect of teammates and coaches is to play hard and stay focused on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter , Rachel , on the White Sox , feels there 's no real difference having a daughter on the team . <p> " A year and a half ago , Rachel went off to baseball camp and came home to inform me that , now , she really knew how to play the game , " Sibbitt laughed . <p> " It was kind of funny , because I 've been coaching her for years and thought I 'd taught her the game . But Mill Valley Little League is a wonderful opportunity for girls to see that they can compete with the boys . " <p> Bill English is a free-lance writer based in Kenwood .
