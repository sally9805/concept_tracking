It must be a statue of Venus , thought Octavia , parking her Volvo in the circular drive next to the mansion . Easing out of the front seat , she crossed the matted , dying grass to a crumbling stone fountain , one obviously no longer in use . In the growing twilight , she gazed up at the bronze sculpture , noticing that the face and body were heartbreakingly beautiful . Venus , the goddess of love , the symbol of physical perfection . Venus had also become the symbol of a man who 'd made a name for himself by examiningsome said exploitingthe subjects of love and beauty in his films . What Hitchcock had been to suspense and Frank Capra to the more innocent American values , Roland Lester had been to romance . His films were world famous , even though he himself , now in his eighty-third year , had become a recluse . Weeds surrounded the base of the once magnificent fountain , climbing the carved stone until the tops lay flattened and decomposing in the filthy water . As Octavia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods in the distance , the tall grass leading down to Long Island Sound , the huge Tudor manorshe knew this might be her first and last visit to the famous Innishannon . She also could n't help but feel that something was terribly wrong . Decay , the kind that came not just from the passage of time but from neglect , was everywhere apparent on the multiacre estate . The house , once considered one of America 's great Eastern castles , looked forlorn and deserted . Octavia was n't sure what she 'd expected , but this was n't it . Why would a man reputedly worth millions allow hisgrounds and his home to descend into such a state of disrepair ? It made no sense . As the sun inched deeper behind the once grand manor house , a chill wind off the sound blew dry leaves across the cracked and pitted drive . So bleak was the scene that had her curiosity not been shamelessly piqued , she would have returned to her car that moment and driven back to New York . But she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summoned . The invitation had been precise . Cocktails at six . Dinner at seven . Formal attire . She assumed that at least a few others had been invited , but since there was n't another car in sight , it seemed that she was the only guest . A postscript had been added by Roland Lester himself . Written in a hand that appeared shaky with age , it had said , " If you love old movies as much as you 've said you do in all your interviews , I have something to discuss that may very well change your life . Do n't fail me , Ms. Thorn . I shall count the days until we meet . " The note was signed , simply , " R. " The whole thing had a vaguely scripted feel to itheavy on the melodrama . She 'd almost expected to see Klieg lights set up on the front lawn waiting to light her arrival . Just the eyes , of course . Shadow and light , the physical as well as spiritual duality from which the old black-and-white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had amazingly expressive eyes . She was born too late for Klieg lights , but hey , she still appreciated a good lighting designer . As Octavia walked up the broad sweep of steps to the arched front door , the air of desolation grew even more powerful . The mansion 's peaks and gables stood high above her , erect and forbidding . The coldness of the crumbling stucco and wood exterior made her feel as if she were about to enter a ruin , not a living person 's home . Since there was no doorbell , Octavia assumed she was to use one of the two brass door knockers . One was cast in the shape of the Greek mask of Comedy , the other of Tragedy . Perhaps Roland Lester was giving his guests a choice . Deciding not to tempt fate , she selected the Comedy mask , but as she tried to pull it away from its hinge , she found that it was stuck fast , rendering it useless . Not a good omen . Pounding on the door with her fist , Octavia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then checked her watch . When nobody answered , she swallowed back her superstitious nature and used the mask of Tragedy to announce her arrival . Moments later , the door swung back and a woman stood before her . Her short , dumpling shape and pleasant smile put some of Octavia 's more overt fears to rest . Octavia handed her the invitation . After studying it silently for a few moments , the woman said , " Come in , please , " taking Octavia 's wrap and draping it over her arm . " I 'm Hilda Gettle , Mr. Lester 's house manager . " " Nice to meet you . " " Did you have trouble finding us ? " " No , the map Mr. Lester sent was more than adequate . " The front foyer was large and dark , paneled in oak and filled with antiques . Through a wide corridor that ran beside the stairs , she could see all the way to the back of the house , where a series of multipaned windows looked out on a veranda , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the dining room . To her left , another long corridor led off toward the west side of the house . The interior , while still breathtaking , was every bit as dank and dilapidated as the exterior . The Oriental carpets and heavy drapes appeared frayed and smelled faintly of mildew . The furniturecirca 1920'slooked faded and undoubtedly full of the dust of decades . If only someone would throw open the windows and let in some fresh air , but then , that would break the spell . Innishannon was seductive in its disintegration . Like her older sister , Cordelia , Octavia had been born with acute intuitive abilities . This was a house of darkness and secrets , nothing she wanted any part of . For a brief instant she wondered if she should n't just offer an excuse , say she was n't feeling well , and leave . But before she could formulate the right malady , she felt the elderly woman 's eyes on her . " Is something wrong , Ms. Thorn ? " " No , I ... ah " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd follow me ? " Like Jane Eyre , caught between fright and fascination , she could n't leave until she 'd met the lord of the manor . As they left the front door and proceeded down the west hall , Octavia became aware of the smell of wood smoke . The scent seemed to center her and calm her down . So did the walls filled with framed photos of famous actors and actresses . Get a grip , she told herself . Coming here tonight could n't put her in any personal danger . It was simply one of life 's little adventures . Sometimes she mistook her rather fertile imagination for intuition . Just because the estate was old and falling apart did n't mean there was anything truly amiss . She 'd come here at the request of one of the most beloved film directors in Hollywood history . What could be more delicious ? While Octavia had made a big splash on the legitimate stage , she 'd never been able to break into movies . Oh , she 'd done a couple of minor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a certain hope that tonight 's meeting would change all that . At thirty-four , her luck had better change soon or Hollywood 's brass ringand the money and fame it representedwould pass her by forever . When they reached the living room , Hilda nodded politely and then left . Octavia found herself alone . Since her host had n't appeared yet , she decided to use the time to survey her surroundings . The room itself could easily have swallowed all of her apartment in Manhattan , and then some . Heavy oak beams crisscrossed the ceiling , while the tall windows were draped in velvet gloom . Clusters of tapestry chairs and couches were spread throughout . The room was spacious , even inviting in its own austere way , and yet it had a certain worn and empty air about it . She prowled around for a few minutes , touching things , looking at the pictures , brushing a finger along the fringe on a lamp , but never ventured far from the fireplace . For some reason , she felt the need to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ocean , the evening had turned chilly . As she stood staring at the burning logs , she suddenly felt something touch the back of her dress . When she turned around , she found a bundle of white fur sniffing her shoes . " And who are you ? " she asked , crouching down to let the little bichon examine her hand . " Busby , you idiot . Come here ! " shouted an annoyed voice . The dog 's owner appeared a few seconds later . It was a woman again , this one a good deal younger than the house manager . She appeared to be in her late twenties , with short tufts of green and magenta hair sticking out from under a baseball cap , a tattoo of a chain around her neck , and four nose rings . The long , gauzy dress seemed to be a trifle 1960 's but then Octavia figured the woman liked to wear period clothes . She stopped dead when she saw she was n't alone . " Who the hell are you ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Busby turned and jumped into her arms . The woman stared at Octavia with such naked curiosity , she was n't sure what to say . " I , ah ... I 'm here at the request of Roland Lester . " She knew she sounded way too formal , but the damn house was making her feel like she 'd entered a time warp . The woman stroked the dog 's fur , digesting the information . " What 's your name ? " " Octavia Thorn . " " You an actress ? " She nodded . " You look like one . " " Thanks . I think . " " Where 's Uncle Roland ? " " Roland Lester is your uncle ? " " Well , great-uncle , but I 'm not big on detail . " " I do n't know where he is , " said Octavia , rising from her crouching position . " I just got here . " " You staying for dinner ? " " That was the plan . " She continued to stare . " Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met . " " Then how come you 're here ? " Octavia wanted to say that it was none of her business , but held her tongue . The woman had n't even introduced herself and here she was administering the third degree . She was n't big on detail or manners . " It 's ... a private matter . " " Really . Private . " " And you are ? " " Oh , sorry . I 'm Gracie . " She held out her hand and shook Octavia 's with gusto . " Do you live here ? " " Yup . Upstairs . The entire third floor is mine . " Octavia had a few of her own questions . " How long has your great-uncle owned Innishannon ? " " Let me think . " She scratched her head through her cap . " He bought it in ' fifty-seven , but did n't move in until years later . I guess he wanted a house where he could get away from his work in Hollywood , but since he was such a workaholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brotherif they 'd move in and caretake it . Since Gramps was Rolo 's personal assistant , he did what he was told . Gramps thought for sure he 'd want to renovate the place , but Rolo insisted it remain just the way it was . I call it the Museum . It 's gone downhill in the past few years , but I think the shabbiness is kind of funky . " She smiled amiably . " Is your grandfather still alive ? " " Sure . He has rooms upstairs on the second floor . Gram died about twelve years ago . He spends a lot of his time in New Jersey with our family , but he 's still the great man 's right arm , I guess you could say . " " I assume your uncle entertains quite a bit . " " Not really . Not since Peg died . Except for a few close friends , of course . Old cronies from his movie days . You 're the first stranger we 've seen around here in ages . " " Who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be a good seven years ago now . It was real sudden . Rolo went into a complete funk . Would n't eat . Could n't sleep . That 's when I arrived . I was finishing my graduate degree at Yale . I had an apartment in New Haven , but I came back here most weekends . Eventually , I just stayed . And then , when I graduated , I moved in . Gramps thought my presence might help . " " And did it ? " She shrugged . " Grief takes time . Believe it or not , I 've grown kind of fond of the old guy . I 'm sorry I 'm going to miss dinner , but I 've got a date with some friends in town . " " In New York ? " " St. Albans . It 's not far . " She kept her eyes fixed on Octavia , which only served to heighten Octavia 's sense that she was some sort of rare fungus everyone wanted to get a good look at before Hilda Gettle rushed back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I better hit the bricks . Enjoy your dinner , Ms. Thorn . Hope I see you again sometime . " She backed out of the room with her dog in her arms and disappeared around the corner . Once Octavia heard a door close deep in the belly of the house , she returned her attention to the fireplace . She hoped Lester would show up soon to put her out of her misery . At this point , the fist of tension inside her stomach had grown so large , dinner seemed out of the question . She needed to find out why she was here . It was probably just a pipe dream , but Octavia harbored a secret hope that the elderly director had some project he was working onsome new movieand he wanted to cast her in the leading role . Even the remote possibility sent shivers up her spine . As she moved to a window seat under one of the tall windows , deciding whether sitting down on the upholstered cushion would do any permanent damage to her designer gown , she noticed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other end of the room . Since the chair was facing away from her , it never occurred to her that someone might be sitting in it . Before she could think what to say , an elderly man with snow-white hair and a thin mustache stood up and turned around . He was wearing a tuxedo with a red cummerbund . Octavia 's startled look must have caused him a moment of amusement because he smiled . Lifting the cigarette he was holding to his lips , he said , " Welcome to Innishannon , Ms. Thorn . I 'm Roland Lester . " What struck her first was his elegance . The way he stood reminded her of a character in a Noel Coward play . He was n't as tall as she 'd expected , but his presence was still commanding . " I ... did n't know you were here . Do you always eavesdrop on your guests ? " " My apologies if I 've upset you . I was just curious to see which of my family and staff would want to get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now he was flattering her . Embarrassing though it was to admit , she 'd always been a sucker for flattery , even the most obvious kind . " As my grandniece said , we rarely have guests anymore , certainly not someone with your ... qualities . " " My qualities ? " Had she really fluttered her lashes just then ? God , the play had switched to Tennessee Williams . A Southern accent would come next . " Please do n't take this the wrong way , Ms. Thorn , but I 've been watching you and your career for several years . I have a chauffeur drive me into New York several times a month so that I can catch a play . Off Broadway , onit does n't matter . I watch and I learn . You may think I 'm just an old man , someone who 's lost his creative edge and his lust for life , but you 'd be wrong . I still know a thoroughbred when I see one . The sad truth is , I 've felt for years that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the icons of the thirties and forties . And then ... well , you went and proved me wrong . " Again , he smiled . " You 've got star quality , Octavia . The kind that can take even an old man 's breath away . " He moved slowly toward her . " You have the fire of a Bette Davis , the beauty of a Joan Fontaine , and the intelligence of a Kate Hepburn . And , my dear , you have natural timing , the kind it takes to become a great comic actress . Your range continually astounds me . " She was n't sure what to say . " Did you say ... Joan Fontaine ? " " You could be her daughter . " He moved even closer , this time taking one of her hands in his . Only now did she notice the two hearing aids , and the filigree of wrinkles that covered his face . But the eyesthey were so clear ... so mesmerizing . " Very simply , Octavia , even though you 've made very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're the direct descendent of that enchanted Hollywood legacy I 've dedicated my life to keeping alive . " He held her hand to his lips . With a sudden and amused lift of his head , he added . " And since you 're the heir apparent , you might as well have the rest as well . " " The rest of what ? " she asked , almost in a trance . Leading her over to a couch , he said , " That 's what I 've called you here to talk about . " They sat down in front of the fire . " Let me start by giving you something . " He removed a small box from his pocket . My God , thought Octavia . This was getting more bizarre by the moment . " I want you to have this . " " What is it ? " " Open it and see . " He waited , his amused smile turning expectant , even eager . Inside she found a key attached to a chain . The key itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ olda skeleton key . The chain , one meant to hang around the neck , looked like it was made of gold . " I 'm confused , " she said , cupping the key in her hand . " What 's it for ? " " That has to remain a secret-for now . But if you agree to my terms , Octavia , I promise , you 'll have the wealth and power you deserve . With that key , you can write your own ticket . Be whatever you want . " Were these the ravings of a man who 'd gone over the edge ? If he had so much money , why did his home look like it was ready for the wrecking ball ? Something did n't smell right . " What terms ? " Before answering , he got up and walked over to a table filled with liquor bottles , glasses , and a container of ice . " First I need your promise that you 'll stay with me here for a few months . " " Stay ? For months ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent play closed last night . Your time is your own , at least for a while . Would staying here with me be so bad ? " " But ... why would I do that ? I do n't even know you . Besides , I have a life in New York . A career . Friends . " He poured them each a brandy . Returning to the couch , he handed her a glass , then raised his in salute . " Forgive an old man for taking his time , but if you 'll be patient with me , Octavia , all will be made clear . " Sitting down next to her , he crossed his legs , stared into the fire and said , " I want to tell you a story .
