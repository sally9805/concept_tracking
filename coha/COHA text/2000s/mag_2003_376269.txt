All five members of The Strokes appear to have studiously avoided wandering under a showerhead since birth . Yet in photographs they never fail to appear devastatingly stylish , like a bunch of Bowery James Bonds . This poseurship is just one of the reasons it takes immense critical discipline not to hate them . The Strokes ' effortlessness is pure fiction ; not since the Velvet Underground met Andy Warhol has a band so effectively been art directed to achieve the look of not having been art directed . But when you hear the Strokes , that cultivated cool disperses with every passing guitar chord , and suddenly , just by listening , you 're cool too . That 's how good their melodies are . <P> The Strokes ' first album , 2001 's Is This It , contains 11 aggressively simple songs about love , sex and getting drunk in the boho paradise of New York City 's East Village . For their follow-up , Room on Fire , out Oct. 28 , they retained the services of producer Gordon Raphael . While some may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it feels more like an assertion of identity . The Strokes look like bohemians , but they 're actually formalists ; their form is the three-minute , verse-chorus-verse rock song , and once again they offer up 11 of the best you will hear this year . The band toys with some clever rhythm changes and guitar effects , and the lyrics tend to be more about failed relationships than casual hook-ups , but the boys are not exactly reinventing the medium . Why bother when you have more or less perfected it ? <P> The album opens with lead singer Julian Casablancas proclaiming of an ex , " I want to be forgotten/And I do n't want to be reminded . " Casablancas has a world-weariness that would ordinarily be suspicious in a 25-year-old . He is the son of model magnate John Casablancas , but a study of his DNA would probably reveal more of a family connection to Holden Caulfield . The lyrics on Room on Fire that stick with you  --  " You are young , darling/For now but not for long , " " Kiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premature angst , but Casablancas sells it well . <P> He sounds genuinely bored through a solid 75% of Room on Fire ; at one point he even advises , " Do n't sing along with me . " But most cynics turn out to be romantics , and at the critical three-quarter point of every song  --  the moment just before the bridge , when a song 's soul is revealed  --  Casablancas turns out to be a believer . On tracks like What Ever Happened ? and Automatic Stop his voice rises , the words get clearer and for a moment he aches in a surprisingly moving way . With his half-closed eyes and half-closed heart , Casablancas is the closest thing there is to a rock-'n ' - roll Bogart .
