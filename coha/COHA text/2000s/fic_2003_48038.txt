ASKED TO DESCRIBE THE writing tutor , James would have written , " To say the man was fat would have been not so much inaccurate as incomplete . The man was fat : no euphemisms would hide the collar of flesh encircling his neck ; the sleeves of skin draping his arms ; the great waistcoat of stomach bunched in front of him . But there are , after all , many ways to be fat , many ways to wear one 's excess . Flesh magnifies who we are already : who has never met the archetypal happy fat man , whose bulk seems so much compacted jollity ? and who has not encountered the large angry man whose mass is a thundercloud trembling on the brink of explosion ? This man , then , was a particularly tremulous kind of fat : the skin rolled down his frame in an arrested avalanche , giving the impression that , at an undisclosed future moment , his body would fall away from him in a crashing rush . For all his size , there was something strangely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he were a giant bubble or cluster of bubbles , dangerously close to bursting . " James would have tried to capture the peculiar way that the man 's very bulk contributed to the impression of his fragility before moving on to his crewcut head , to the round , sweat-rimmed glasses pressing into his face , to the mouth pursing as he read through the paper on his desk . He would have elaborated on the tutor 's white button-down shirt , the black plastic wristwatch tourniquetting his left wrist ; all in all , James reckoned he could have spent a good page or two of single-spaced , ten-point type on this man , whose name he thought was Sean but was n't sure . <p> And , he thought sourly , his creative writing professor - Privates , as he secretly called him , after his most famous novel , The Private Visitor , which James had read and renamed The Visitor 's Privates - would have returned those pages looking as they always did , as if they had been bled on , scoring out words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ margins with assorted question marks and exclamation points ; ending with a block-capital reproof : " HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU , MR . WILLIAMSON , THAT PROSE IS ARCHITECTURE , NOT INTERIOR DECORATION ? YOU ARE , I REMIND YOU , A TYRO . ACCEPT THAT YOU DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING AND WRITE ABOUT IT CLEARLY . THE BAROQUE IS OVER . " It had been the same with each of the five weekly assignments James had submitted so far , each story returned scored and scarred and , despite himself , James with it . His ideas , the professor wrote , were absurd : " Science Fiction and Fantasy stories are the province of the perpetual adolescent " ; " Horror stories are meant for groups of drunken teenagers sitting around the campfire , not the printed page . " Nor was Privates enamored of James 's style : " Read Strunk and White , Mr. Williamson , and learn to Omit Needless Words . " The trend had culminated in his creative writing professor 's insistence that he consult the tutoring center to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syntax , his extraordinary and ridiculous tropes . James had been the only member of Creative Writing I singled out for a visit to The Writing Scene , which distinction Privates had shared with the rest of the class . Had he not been teetering on the brink of failing this class that was supposed to be the cornerstone of his prospective major in Creative Writing , James would have refused , stolen a line from a favorite story and told the professor he would prefer not to . As it was , his string of D-minuses had led him here , to the sub-sub-basement of the Humanities Building . <p> With a snort , the tutor looked up from James 's paper . " Well , " he said in a voice that James thought surprisingly nasal for a man with such a small nose . " Well well well . " The tutor had placed his hands palm-down on his desk as he was reading ; now they fluttered up from it , as if trying to break off and fly away . <p> James said nothing : he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't necessitate his being excessively cooperative . On the wall behind him , a clock chopped off the seconds . He glanced at the bare white walls to either side of him , behind the tutor . Overhead , fluorescent lights hummed and snapped . <p> The tutor ( Sean ? ) cleared his throat and asked , " What was the assignment ? " <p> " To write about loss , " James said . <p> " Loss , yes . " He raised one hand , passed it over James 's paper . " And you wrote about a man whose heart is literally cut out and stolen from him by a mysterious figure . Would you say that 's an accurate summary ? " <p> " It 's a kind of fable , " James said , shifting in his molded plastic seat . <p> " A fable , yes . How very interesting . Is that what you write , Mr. Williamson ? Fables ? " <p> " Sometimes . Sometimes I write other things . " <p> " Such as ? " <p> James shrugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of stuff . " <p> " Mmm . Not much for realism , then ? " <p> " I would n't say that . " <p> " Oh ? " <p> " There are more ways to be realistic than writing about frustrated professors lusting after their students . " Which was , James thought acidly , Privates 's entire career summarized in twenty words or less . <p> Sean ( ? ) blinked . " You do n't say . " <p> " Yeah : there 's emotional realism , psychological realism , moral realism , aesthetic realism . " <p> " Right , " the tutor said . " And you expect to achieve this by writing about a man who has his heart cut out . " <p> " I want to use metaphor . " <p> " Ahh , metaphor . You do love your metaphors , it 's true ; to a fault , I would say . " <p> " What 's wrong with metaphors ? " James asked . <p> " Used sparingly and judiciously , nothing . But yours are rather baroque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say so . " <p> The tutor frowned . " Maybe we could try a writing exercise . " <p> " All right . " <p> " Let 's look at one of your sentences . " Sean ( ? ) ' s hands moved over James 's story , as if to catch a sentence by the tail and hold it up for inspection . He stabbed the middle of the page with his finger : " This one should do . ' Carl turned the doorknob , feeling as he did so a deep , unreasoning dread for which he could not account , since , although he did not know who had rung the doorbell , he had no reason for suspecting it to be anything more than the mailman , or another of the peregrinating Christian missionaries who appeared from time to time offering salvation ; nonetheless , as he swung open the front door , he felt the same sensation he had that day in the hospital when he had seen the doctor walking toward him and had known that the news about his father was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed , " That 's quite a sentence . " <p> " Yes it is , " James said stiffly . <p> " Let 's be honest : it runs on a bit . At the very least , it could use a period or two to break it up into more manageable units . Really , though , it 's in dire need of pruning , would n't you say ? So : can you tell me how you might shorten it ? " <p> " No . " <p> " No ? " <p> " I would n't shorten it . I 'm happy with it the way it is . " <p> " You do n't think it gives your reader any trouble ? " <p> " In what way ? " <p> " There is the matter of clarity . " <p> " Define clarity . " <p> The tutor frowned . " Mr. Williamson , you 're being quite difficult - " <p> " I'm. not , " James said . " I 'm just asking you to define what constitutes clarity in writing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " <p> " What could n't you understand about that sentence ? " <p> " Well , it was n't that I could n't - I mean , your style is rather tortured - " <p> " ' Tortured ' ? " James echoed , leaning forward . " How is my style ' tortured ' ? " <p> Laughing , waving his hands , Sean said , " Obviously , you 've never heard of Strunk and White . " <p> " I 've read The Elements of Style . " <p> " You 'd never know it , to read your writing . What happened to Omit Needless Words ' ? " <p> " I think it 's crap . " <p> He might as well have reached across the desk and slapped the tutor . " Excuse me ? " <p> " I said I think it 's crap . I suppose Strunk and White is okay if you 're a technical writer - or if you 're writing papers for classes , that kind of thing . But I ca n't see that it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 've never heard of having to learn the rules before you can break them ? " <p> " Which rules ? Whose rules ? " <p> " The rules all the great writers followed . " <p> " All of them ? What about Henry James ? H.P. Lovecraft ? Samuel Delany ? How would Strunk and White help them ? " <p> " Samuel who ? " <p> " Delany . " When the tutor continued to stare at him , James added , " He writes science fiction . " <p> " Which explains why I 've never heard of him . " <p> " What about James , then ? Or have n't you heard of him ? " <p> " Who reads Henry James , anymore ? " <p> " I do . Enough people do to keep his books in print . " <p> " Graduate students and professors . " <p> " People who are n't afraid of a challenge . " <p> " You like to argue , I see . " <p> " I know what I like and I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his head and pushed his fingers up under his glasses , squeezing the bridge of his nose . He said , " I do n't think you 're ready for the help I could give you . I think you need to see one of the other tutors . " <p> " Sure , if that 's what you think . " James reclined in his chair . <p> " Here , " the tutor said , holding out James 's paper as if he were a butcher and it a poor cut of meat . " I 'm referring you to Raymond : go out of this office , turn left , and take the stairs in front of you . You 'll find his office at the foot of the stairs . " <p> " There 's more to this place ? " James asked . " I did n't know Humanities had a sub-sub-basement , let alone , what ? a sub-sub-sub-basement ? What is this , " gesturing at the small room with his paper , " an old fallout shelter ? " <p> Sean shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Okay , " James said . " I guess I 'll be on my way , then . Thanks for your time . " He walked out of the office , turned left , and saw the stairway leading down . At the top of the stairs , he thought he heard Sean call something to him . He paused , listening , then returned to the office and leaned his head in the doorway . " I 'm sorry , I did n't catch that . " <p> The room was empty . The tutor had vanished , leaving the four white walls , the black desk and molded chairs , the clock on the wall hacking away at time . Above , the fluorescent lights buzzed and flickered , and James thought of a stage the moment after the actors have abandoned it . Sean must have slipped out while his back had been turned , shouting whatever he had shouted as he was climbing the stairs that had brought James here . Hard to believe the man could have departed with such speed and quiet ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some kind of hidden passage built into the walls when this place had been a fallout shelter . If it had served as a shelter : had he seen the old radiation signs upstairs ? He could n't remember . No matter : the tutor had left and he had n't heard him ; that was all . James turned again to the stairs to the sub-sub-sub-basement , wondering what Sean had said . It could n't have been , " You 'll wish for my time soon enough " ; that did n't make any sense . <p> Maybe he should n't have given the poor guy such a hard time , James thought as his sneakers slapped concrete , the echoes chasing each other up and down the dim stairwell . It might have been easier - quicker , anyway - to nod , smile , be polite , listen to whatever pearls of idiocy the tutor had to cast before him , and then get the hell out of Dodge and go back to doing what he 'd been doing . Damnit , though , this had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that snapped the camel 's back . To be fair , Sean could n't know that he was only the latest link in a chain stretching back through Privates to James 's mother , who had met his declaration that he wanted to be a writer with , " That 's nice , dear , but how are you going to make any money ? " It was a chain whose first link had been forged when he was a high school freshman and had won the spring writing contest with a story about a family being pursued by the ghost of the grandfather they 'd neglected to death . The story had earned him a check for ten dollars , publication in the school newspaper , and an extended lecture from his father one car-ride home during which his dad had told him that this was not the kind of thing he wanted to see James writing , this was not who he was , this Stephen King stuff . He could n't stop James reading the stuff , though God only knew what he found in it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . James had sat in the passenger seat of the family car , a cavernous Ford LTD , feeling whatever modicum of triumph had seemed his evaporating under the withering heat of his father 's dismissal . <p> He had felt that same heat sitting in Privates 's class , which he had walked into on the first day of school with the relief of a man lost in the desert who finally stumbles into an oasis . At last , he would have an audience for the stories he had been discreetly writing for the last four years . At last , he would be surrounded by people who believed in writing , who did n't suspect it , view it as something best avoided by decent folk . But the oasis was a mirage , he had learned as the creative writing professor discussed and dismembered James 's fiction to the other students , some of whom sought to jab their own barbed remarks . He had endured the slashing of his sentences , the dissection of his vocabulary , the evisceration of his plots . Privates ran his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he prowled the front of the room , James 's latest story crumpled in one hand , the other locked into an accusatory point that stabbed at the pages in his hand , at James , at whoever wanted to join the bloodbath . The classroom lights shone on his extended forehead . Privates 's voice was always angry ; it bit off words and snarled phrases ; so his analyses of James 's work sounded more like rant than reason . James left class feeling as if every last inch of skin had been flayed from him . <p> All of which meant that , faced with the likes of Sean , James was not about to roll over and play dead . He was n't going to prove anything to the tutor , but neither did he have to pretend that Sean 's prejudices were anything more than that . No doubt , he should have reserved his remarks for Privates ; in class , though , his tongue died in his mouth : he was unable to think of an answer to the professor until hours , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cowardly part of himself that he despised counseled , it was probably best not to make too much of an enemy of Privates : the Creative Writing program here at SUNY Huguenot was small , and the chances were better than even he was going to encounter the professor again , especially if he majored , or even minored , in Creative Writing . A panicked thought from that cowardly corner : would the tutor pass along James 's assorted remarks to Privates ? Privates was a big fan of Strunk and White : their slender beige volume occupied a privileged place on his course syllabus , and he invoked their names with the regularity of a devotee naming his god . James did n't know if the tutors were responsible for filing reports with the professors who referred students to them ; he supposed so . Well , he had n't said anything that damning , had he ? ( " I think it 's crap . " ) Nothing that could n't be retracted , at least . <p> God , these stairs went down deep . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had to reach Sean 's office . He could n't say much for the lighting , either : if the school were going to ask students to use these facilities , it had better provide more than a single bulb set high in the wall every fifty feet or so ; if it wanted to avoid a lawsuit , that was . He literally could not see the stairs in front of him , and had to rely on a guardrail whose surface flaked away beneath his skin . <p> There : his destination lay ahead of him , a rectangle of light across the sub-sub-sub-basement landing . Wondering if he truly had reached the Humanities building 's lowest level , James glanced about , searching for another set of stairs leading still further into the earth . No : nothing he could see , anyway . From within the lighted doorway , a voice called , " Come in , Mr. Williamson . " <p> If James could have spent one to two pages of single-spaced , ten-point type describing the first tutor , he could have consumed twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentences racing across his computer screen : " Everything about this man came to a point : from the widow 's peak shaping his crewcut into a wedge , to the narrow nose jutting out of his face like the prow of an icebreaker ; from the tapered goatee sharpening his chin , to the long surgeon 's fingers steepled under it ; from the bat-like ears , to the prominent cheekbones threatening to tear through the skin stretched taut over them . His eyes - dark , liquid brown , protruding - were a pair of drill bits set in their sockets , and his gaze passed over you the way a barber might strop his straight razor . His mouth was a single dramatic slash cut into his flesh . <p> " He curved across his desk at you , this man , not in the tired slouch of an underpaid civil servant , but in a rigid , trembling arc , much the way a weapon , a knife , a scimitar , might point curving in your direction , the light playing on its polished sides . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a block of something : from a single , giant tooth , you thought as you looked at him , from the tooth of a leviathan , of a monster from the lower depths . His features , fine as they were , were no more than scrimshaw tracing the surface of a great fang whose serrated edges were visible just out of the corners of your eyes . You felt the paint was cracking , beginning to peel off , and you felt equally that the man in front of you did not mind that in the least , would be only too happy to brush off the last colors of his disguise and stand for all to see in his awful whiteness . " Which was to say nothing of the tutor 's clothes , of the white , button-down shirt whose creases were so sharp they sliced the eye looking at them , of the black suspenders that bit into his shoulders , of the black plastic watch that blemished his left wrist . <p> The office , too , James thought as he gave his paper into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molded plastic chair , would demand pages . Where Sean 's had been bare beyond the point of minimalism , this one was decorated with a distinctive taste . Raymond 's desk was an oaken monster that would have been more at home dominating the office of the university 's president . Its top was crowded by a half dozen piles of paper , each one held in place by a slender steel spike onto which it had been jammed like an oversized moth . Behind the desk to either side was a file cabinet : the top drawer of the one to James 's left was open , and was that a human skull sitting on top of the cabinet ? Surely it was some kind of medical model . Averting his gaze from its empty stare , James saw that the other file cabinet was crowned by a trio of mason jars filled with a thick , greenish-yellow liquid in which floated objects whose identities he was too far away to discern clearly . Plaques of all shapes and sizes crowded the office 's walls , each one offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CREATIVE WRITING PROGRAMS STIFLE YOUNG WRITERS . IN MY OPINION , THEY DO NOT STIFLE ENOUGH OF THEM . " " PROSE IS ARCHITECTURE , NOT INTERIOR DECORATION . " " SLAUGHTER YOUR DARLINGS . " " OMIT NEEDLESS WORDS . " " THE BAROQUE IS OVER . " " CUT WHAT CAN BE CUT , THEN CUT AGAIN . " He had heard , he reflected , most of these platitudes uttered by Privates . What is this , he thought amusedly , a conspiracy ? Nestled amidst the various plaques were photographs of skulls , which appeared to have been cut from biology and medical textbooks and thumbtacked to the wall . To his back , a clock steadily struck off seconds ; overhead , fluorescent lights hummed . <p> The tutor turned a page , drawing James 's attention back to him . Raymond read hanging over the paper , his head jerking back and forth in minute motions that reminded James of a bird , a raven or crow , pecking at a carcass . He did n't take long to arrive at the end of James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up across his desk , fighting the smirk twisting his lips , and said , " Well . Well well well . " When James failed to reply , he went on , " What was the assignment ? " <p> " To write about loss , " James said . <p> " Loss , yes . And you wrote about a man whose heart is literally cut out and stolen from him by a mysterious figure . Would you say that 's a fairly accurate summary ? " <p> Had n't Sean said something similar ? " I 'd say that 's fairly accurate , " James replied . Maybe there was a script the tutors were supposed to follow . <p> " And , " Raymond flipped through James 's paper , " judging from your professor 's comments , he was n't too taken with what you wrote . " <p> Flushing , James said , " You could say that . " <p> " Why do you suppose that is ? " <p> " Because it is n't what he wants , " James said after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a story should be . " <p> " I 'm not sure I agree , but let 's suppose I did . What do you think your professor thinks a story should be ? " <p> James sighed and quoted , " ' story is a self-contained organic unity that offers the reader a brief snapshot of reality . Through indirection and understatement , it relates the process whereby its protagonist achieves a momentary insight , called an epiphany . ' That was what he told us on the first day of class , and it 's what he 's told us every class since then . " <p> " That 's not a bad definition , is it ? " Despite his sharp edges , the tutor , James thought , had the bright , wide-eyed manner and voice of a children 's TV show host , plastically pleasant . <p> " It 's not bad : it 's just incomplete . " <p> " How so ? " <p> " There 's more than one kind of story . " <p> " Of course , " Raymond said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving on to other things ? " <p> " They are n't the basics , " James said . " The basics vary according to what you 're trying to do . " <p> " I 'm not sure this is getting us anywhere : let 's come back to it . Try this : what would you say is the point to what you 've written ? " <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> " One could argue for what you 've written as a form of allegory or symbolism : debased modes , to be sure , but possessed of a certain history . So I 'm asking you : What is your system ? What is it your story encodes , what worldview , what philosophy ? " <p> " That is n't what I 'm doing . " <p> " I did n't think so . " The tutor shook his head sadly . " If you ca n't justify your writing that way , then how about as entertainment , as escapism ? " <p> " I 'm not doing that , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> James shifted in his seat . " I 'm trying to use non-realistic techniques to write about reality . It 's like that Emily Dickinson poem , you know : ' Tell the truth - / But tell it slant - / Success in circuit lies . ' " <p> " Most readers spend their days slogging through reality , " Raymond said , " they do n't read this kind of writing to be splattered with it . " <p> " I do n't accept that . I do n't see why this fiction ca n't do everything any other kind of fiction can . " <p> " It is n't suited for it , " the tutor said . " Everything about a story like yours tells the reader that it should have nothing to do with the real world . It should be a doorway to another place , a kind of holiday for the mind . " <p> " You 're wrong . " <p> The tutor blinked , and his eyes seemed to grow sharper , the plastic facade slip ever so slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Look at Samuel Delany . Look at Theodore Sturgeon . Look at Ramsey Campbell . There are any number of writers who prove that you can write this kind of stuff and still do serious , literary work . " <p> " I 'm not sure this is getting us anywhere , " Raymond said , " let 's come back to it . There 's the matter of your style . " <p> Crossing his arms , James said , " What about my style ? " <p> " It 's a bit much , is n't it ? What 's the word your professor used ? ... Ah , yes , ' murky/ I think that about hits the nail on the head , would n't you say ? Of course not , " Raymond added when James said nothing . " You disagree with such an assessment . " <p> " I do . " <p> " To be perfectly honest , I ca n't see how . Surely even you ca n't think your writing is clear . Listen to this line - where is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which you would withdraw a splinter from a wound , the trench-coated figure withdrew its blood-soaked hand from the gaping ruin that had been Carl 's chest , its palm rich with the piece of throbbing meat that Carl saw with shock was his still-beating heart . ' " The tutor ran his hand through his hair . " I do n't know where to begin with such a sentence . It sprawls all over the place . You start with that adverb , and then you follow it with an adverbial clause , and then you follow all that with an adjective . And the repetition ! It takes a day and a half for the reader to reach the sentence 's subject . Your writing meanders : it wants to stop and smell every single daisy on its way to its destination . ' Omit Needless Words ' : your professor has written that all over your paper , and I have to concur . I ca n't think of better advice for you . " <p> Frustration welled in James 's chest . If he had not rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would for this guy . " It 's challenging , yeah , but that 's the idea . " <p> " What 's the point of such a challenge , though ? It obstructs the reading of the story . " <p> " Why ca n't it be part of reading the story ? Why ca n't part of your experience be the language itself ? " <p> " That is n't what writing is supposed to do : it 's the medium , not the message . " <p> " Why ca n't it be ? " <p> Raymond 's eyes narrowed , and James had the feeling the tutor 's plastic pleasantness was in peril of slipping . " Perhaps a visual aid would be useful here , " Raymond said , standing and reaching back to the cabinet on his right . His spidery fingers found the skull sitting there , closed on it , lifted and carried it forward to his desk , where he set it on top of James 's story . " Do you know what this is ? " he asked . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Williamson , structure ! " The tutor hissed the word , his fingers caressing the dull ivory hemisphere . " Without this , you are a puddle of organs . What good is a heart without a ribcage to hang it in , a brain without a skull to keep it safe ? " <p> " But without those organs , " James said , " your skeleton is so much calcium . " <p> Raymond knocked on the bone . " This endures . Structure lasts ; whereas flesh , ornament , decays , runs to rot and ruin . Decoration is distraction : you must learn that . It 's self-indulgence , a trap . It 's like stained glass . How many grand structures have I seen ruined by stained glass , by those windows winking in the sunlight , drawing attention away from what is important , from the form , the architecture . Break the stained glass windows ! " Raymond shouted , " Smash the gargoyles clustered on theledges ! Scrape off the paintings on the walls ! Throw over the altar ! Get rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and White , " he concluded , quieting , " it 's all there for you in Strunk and White . Structure . " Cradling the skull in both hands , he held it up before him like an imitation Hamlet , gazing lovingly at its stark grin . James half-expected him to quote the famous play . He did not expect the tutor to bring the skull in to his mouth , extending his tongue as he did so . Raymond 's tongue was sharp , pink , and wet , and he ran it up the center of the skull , which he turned in his hands so that his tongue traversed it from brow to nape . Shocked , James sat watching , unable to offer a suitable response . When he was finished , the tutor returned the skull to its place on the file cabinet and slumped in his seat . His eyes were glazed . " Strunk and White , " he said thickly . <p> " So I 've heard , " James said nervously . <p> " You 'd do well to listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have much use for the little beige book . " <p> " I ca n't say I 'm surprised . " Raymond smirked . <p> " Yeah , well , to each his own , right ? " <p> " Wrong , " Raymond said , his voice the rasp of a blade leaving its sheath . The mask had come loose . <p> " Excuse me ? " <p> " There are consequences . There are penalties for refusing to follow the rules . " <p> " I know : Did you see my grade ? " <p> " Much worse things than grades lie in store for you . " <p> " I 'm sorry ? " <p> " You will be . Yes , you most certainly will be . I have no doubt about that , nor should you . The things that are waiting for you .... Sadly , I ca n't administer them . It 's my duty to be reasonable , to try to persuade you to good sense through careful debate . What comes after I fail is left to the devices of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Yes . I believe I 've done all I can for you . He will take it from here . It 's almost a pity : you could have learned ; I could have taught you . I could have helped you build the edifice of your future . I could have helped you construct something that would last . " <p> " I think I 've had enough for tonight , " James said . Suddenly , he was nervous , his leg bouncing up and down restlessly , his palms moist . It was the kind of unease he had last felt living at home , when confrontation with his father loomed and he sat in his room trying to read a book , unable to concentrate on the words for listening for the crunch of tires on gravel that would announce his dad 's return from work and their imminent argument . <p> " Almost , " Raymond said . He held out James 's paper as a surgeon might hold out a freshly-excised tumor , all pretense at pleasantry long gone . " You 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs . " <p> Taking his paper , James said , " I thought this was the bottom of the stairs . " <p> " Oh , no : you 'll find these stairs go down quite far . " <p> " Honestly , I do n't think there 's any point in my taking up anyone else 's time , " James repeated , rising from his chair and backing toward the door . " You think what you think , I think what I think , and there you have it , right ? " <p> " You will see the Editor . He 's waiting for you . " <p> " I guess he gets an early night , then . " <p> " He is waiting for you . " <p> Without another word , James turned and walked out the door . The stairway was directly in front of him . When he went to step up , though , his foot swept through empty space and he had to grab the handrail to stop from toppling headlong down the stairs descending before him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ? He looked around furiously . There were no other entrances or exits visible ; this had to be the staircase that had brought him here . Now , there were only stairs sinking still deeper into the ground . Voice cracking , he shouted , " What the hell is this ? " <p> " He 's waiting for you , " Raymond called back . A shape darkened the tutor 's doorway ; James turned to see what the man wanted . <p> What he saw sent him stumble-rushing headlong down the stairs so fast he was rounding the midway landing and pounding toward the Editor 's office before he even could start thinking about what had bulked in the entrance . The light had been behind it , so James had had difficulty distinguishing much more than a silhouette , but that had been enough . The figure standing there had appeared at once an enormous , dark bird , with shining eyes and glistening plumage , and something else , a mountainous heap with quivering , jagged edges . Whatever it was , the sight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a china plate ; his only coherent thought , What the hell ? , repeating like a neon sign steadily blinking on and off . Instinct filled in the gap , sent him flying down the stairs . Were those footsteps behind him ? The echo of his sneakers in the stairwell was too loud for him to tell . So focused was he on possible pursuit that the stairway 's gradual turning to the right , transforming it into a spiral , registered only peripherally . James reached the foot of the stairs , saw the lighted doorway across from him , and , still in the grip of instinct , not thinking that he had been less than keen to be here just a few minutes prior , raced through it into the Editor 's office . <p> It was too late for such thoughts in any event : the Editor was half-standing from his chair and saying , " Come in , Mr. Williamson , " one hand out for the paper James thrust into it reflexively . Chest heaving , blood pounding , fames collapsed into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You do n't sound too well . " <p> " There was - upstairs - Raymond 's office - Raymond , " James panted . <p> " Ah , Raymond , " the Editor said . " You saw him . " <p> " Yes , " James nodded , " Raymond . " What had he seen ? <p> The Editor turned his attention to James 's paper . Thoughts swirling ( a bird ? a ... ? ) , James watched him . As had been the case with the tutors , there was material here for writing ; a distant part of his mind recognized that . But any facility with language he possessed was gone , stunned if not smashed by the dark thing in the doorway , leaving him powerless to describe the man sitting across the desk from him . Where to begin ? The Editor 's tweed jacket ? It looked slightly worn , but otherwise unremarkable . His white , button-down shirt ? Similarly unremarkable . Bland as his clothes were , though , there was something about them that nagged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , James decided after a minute . ( A bird ? ) It was n't so much that they were too big or too small , as that they appeared the wrong shape for the person wearing them . There were , James saw as he peered more closely , strange lumps pressing against the jacket 's sleeves , its shoulders , as if the skin beneath were host to a forest of tumors . The stripes in the tweed helped to disguise the deformity , but once it became apparent to you , it was inescapable . Likewise , the Editor 's face and hands were suspect . With a shock , James realized that the Editor had the same face as Privates : the high forehead , the watery eyes , the pug nose - but a Privates at least ten years younger , still riding the success of his lone single bestseller . His hair was black , shining . His skin was tanned a rich orange-brown , but it looked more like a layer of makeup that had been smeared onto his flesh than the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his professor , but the resemblance was sufficiently uncanny for James to look away , at the office . <p> A series of plain bookcases traversed the walls , each standing about three feet high ; each with three shelves filled with row after row of the same narrow beige book : Strunk and White 's Elements of Style , repeated over and over again . The tops of the bookcases were crowded with an assortment of letter openers , each in the form of a different kind of sword . <p> Broadswords rested next to scimitars , sabers to cutlasses . Above the bookcases , framed photographs showed Roman arenas in various states of disrepair . Behind him , the click of the clock severed one second from the next ; overhead , fluorescent lights buzzed . <p> " Well , " said the Editor , looking up from James 's story . " Well well well . " When James did not respond , he proceeded , " What was the assignment ? " <p> For the third time that night , James said , " To write about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wrote about a man whose heart is literally cut out and stolen by a mysterious figure . Would you say that 's an accurate summary ? " <p> James stared at the Editor . Somewhere tonight , he thought , he had stepped through the proverbial looking glass , dropped down the rabbit hole . When had that happened ? Had it been when he had sat down with Sean ? Or had it been the moment he had opened the door to The Writing Scene and stepped across the threshold ? <p> The Editor said , " I think that 's a fair assessment of what you 've written , and since I do n't hear you disagreeing , I 'll assume you do , too . I see no point in wasting my time or yours , Mr. Williamson . I do n't know about you , but I am very busy , very very busy . I want to cut to the chase . You 're here because other techniques have proved ineffectual . Shame and reason work well in many cases , but there are always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's where I step in . I 'm direct and I 'm efficient . Do you speak French , Mr. Williamson ? " <p> " French ? No , not really : I took it in high school , but - " <p> " You would have no idea what I was talking about if I said , ' Il n'y a pas de hors-texte , ' then , would you ? " <p> " ' There is n't - there ' - could you repeat that ? " <p> " ' There is nothing outside the text , ' " the Editor said . " Do n't feel too bad , Mr. Williamson : the man who wrote those words has no idea of their true meaning , either . There is nothing outside the text . Nothing at all . Everything is textual ; everything is made of words . Everything is language . Can you think a thought without language ? Impossible . " <p> " That is n't true : there are feelings . " <p> " And the minute you feel whatever rarefied emotion you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . You may not call it ' anger ' or ' joy ' ; you may call it , ' Way that my heart swells in my chest when I see the Sun rise over the ocean . ' It does n't matter : which ever way you turn , you are caught in language 's web . Please do n't waste my time with arguments , " the Editor said , raising a hand as James went to speak . " If you ca n't accept this , it is n't my problem , any more so than if you could n't accept gravity . Your refusal to believe the condition of reality does not make it any less real . <p> " If everything is textual , Mr. Williamson , then I 'm sure you 'll agree that the way we use language has tremendous consequence . It portends more than you , no doubt , have imagined ; it portends more than you can imagine . If we wish to be clean and pure , then our language must be clean and pure . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires an orderly language . Such things as metaphor , simile , synecdoche , metonymy , bring disorder ; even a comparison so seemingly simple as , ' My love is like a red , red rose , ' spawns meanings that run off in all directions . It is for this reason that such language is to be abhorred . It can not be excised entirely , dream though I do of such an accomplishment , but it can be discouraged , diminished , contained . And writing that makes use of these same figures at length , writing such as this , " the Editor gestured at James 's story , " that wallows in it , also can be discouraged , diminished , contained . We can not eradicate what you do , Mr. Williamson , but we can keep it in a safe place . <p> " For such an arrangement to succeed , however , both parties must agree to it . Both sides must play by the same rules . You are not playing by the rules , my young friend , and that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if we let it proceed too far . We 've made that mistake in the past , not intervening until it was too late , and what never should have seen the light of day was being reviewed on the front page of The New York Times Book Review . It takes a long time to repair that kind of damage , years and sometimes decades to corral such works . It was for this reason that we began our move into the university system , in an effort to nip future problems in the bud , to instruct you and your fellows in the rules of the game while there was still time for them to be effective . " <p> Shaking his head , James said , " You 're losing me . What are you saying , that you 're some kind of government agency ? Are you connected to the NEA ? " <p> The Editor laughed , the sound of a guillotine dropping . " No , Mr. Williamson , we 're a bit more than a government agency , quite a bit more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some spectacular successes with the NEA . Our role is more prestigious than mere government . We are in the service of They Who Walk Between ; our Masters swim the - well , it 's all rather much for you to comprehend , really . We are the vassals of those forces that seek order , that long for cleanliness . We serve those who seek the straight line , the unencumbered way , the direct path . We do our part to make of this place a more suitable abode for them ; they , in turn , bestow on us such morsels of their power as we can accept . " <p> James had the feeling that he was n't hearing the Editor 's words completely , that there was a critical component to them that was eluding him . He knew what he thought the tanned man across from him was saying , but that could n't be right . His mind still must be piecing itself together from whatever it was he had seen upstairs . ( A bird ? A ... ? ) Trying not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " So , it 's an international thing ? You 're part of a multinational corporation ? And you 're running a tutoring center at a small college in upstate New York ? " His voice could not disguise his skepticism . <p> " As of this moment , we are affiliated with thirty-four colleges and universities in schools ranging up and down the country . We have plans to expand . As for our involvement in such mundane places as the State University of New York at Huguenot : think , Mr. Williamson , think ! Why is it that , when a dictator seizes power , the first thing he does is to order all the poets lined up and shot ? Why do you suppose that is ? Because there 's no surer shot than a poet ? Of course not . They do so because they understand the power that is writing . Your ancestors believed words were magic , and they were right . If everything is textual , then each and every word is a component of reality , and collections of them have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not follow those dictators ' leads , then , and have all the writers executed ? " James asked . " For the sake of argument . " <p> " Because such actions always and inevitably have the opposite effect . Want to make a novel a bestseller overnight ? Assassinate its author . Want to put a poem on the lips of every man , woman , and child for two hundred miles around ? Cut the poet 's throat . Much as we might like to hang everyone who 's ever written so much as a grocery list up by the thumbs and eviscerate him , I 'm afraid more subtle means are required to bring the magic that is language under control . " <p> " Shame and reason ? " <p> " Very good , Mr. Williamson , very good . " <p> " Although Raymond was n't very reasonable , not really . " ( What had he seen ? ) <p> " The appearance of reason is all that is required , " the Editor said . " Indeed , it 's more than sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rationality and it will be accepted . " <p> James wondered if he were having a breakdown , if the entire night had been an extended and elaborate hallucination . He said , " I still do n't understand , I guess . You 've just finished telling me how powerful I am : what makes you think that I 'm going to change my writing to suit you , or anyone else , for that matter ? " " You could be powerful , " the Editor corrected . " Potential does not equal being . As of this moment , you 're less than nobody . The stream of pages that pours from your word processor could dry up tomorrow and never be missed . Of course , we do n't want the situation to come to that . You are of far more use to us alive than ... any thing else . There is a place for you and what you do ; I simply intend to help you find it and to keep within its borders . My Masters , you see , have their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greater part of their essence lives , moves , and has its being at a level more abstract than you can conceive . On their plane , they move with the majesty of great whales in the ocean . They are ... for them to descend to this place , " the Editor waved his hand , " requires that , on that abstract , intangible level , conditions be as calm , as orderly , as possible . It is , I suppose , one of their few liabilities , their susceptibility to the turbulence of human thought . The more stilled the mass of such thoughts , the more of themselves my Masters can bring to it . And the more of my Masters here , the more they can help us in our quest to bring order to this filthy ball of muck . This is why we insist that everything be in its place . We can not remove the human need for entertainment , but we have discovered that we do n't need to . We can do something better : we can channel it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can take a dangerous stimulant , and make of it a narcotic . <p> " Needless to say , I recognize that a certain amount of intimidation and force will be required to achieve my stated goal . But that is the part I play . " <p> " Wait , " Tames said , holding up his hands as if to prevent the Editor from lunging at him , " what do you mean by ' intimidation and force ' ? " <p> " I mean what I say and I say what I mean , " the Editor replied . He was holding a sheaf of papers in his right hand , not James 's story but an assortment of yellow legal pages and typed sheets , all of them covered with black handwriting . James had not seen him reach for them ; it was as if they had appeared in his hand . " Everything is text , Mr. Williamson : What makes you think you 're any different ? What makes you believe you 're anything more than , say , a character in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be working on his dissertation ? " <p> For a reason he could not name , the sight of the various pages fluttering in the Editor 's orange-brown hand filled James with a dread that reached from the pit of his stomach to the back of his throat . Absurd , he knew , but he felt the urge to leap out of his chair and make a grab for them . Instead , he attempted a grin and said , " This is - " <p> " This is the way of the world , " the Editor said . With his left hand , he selected a letter opener from the bookcase to his left . It was a replica of a Roman short sword , a gladius . As he watched , the Editor placed the flock of pages onto his desk and , in a smooth , fluid arc , drove the letter opener through the center of them . <p> Pain exploded in James 's chest , slamming him back in his chair . It felt as if a foot and a half of sharpened steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For a frozen moment , James could not speak , could not breathe , and then he was screaming . Never had he felt anything like this : the closest he had come was an inflamed appendix that had required emergency surgery , and what he had remembered as a mountain of suffering was dwarfed by this , a foothill beside the Everest of the hurt piercing him . Tears flooded his face ; his nose streamed ; he screamed . He could not think : he was only a body curled around the red agony that had replaced his heart . <p> " Do you feel that ? " the Editor asked , leaning back in his chair , his eyes roaming from the letter opener jammed into his desk to James writhing in his chair back to the letter opener . " Of course you do . What I should ask is , Do you understand what is happening to you ? Do you know who is doing this to you ? " As James continued screaming , the Editor shouted , " Mr. Williamson , this will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your part . I ask you again , DO YOU KNOW WHO IS DOING THIS TO YOU ? " <p> James stopped screaming . Through clenched teeth , he breathed , " You are . " <p> " Me ? Oh no , Mr. Williamson , no no no . I do n't have anything to do with this . You are doing this to yourself . " <p> " lam ? " <p> " Why yes , of course , yes you are . It 's been you who have been so stubborn , you who have refused to take heed of the cautions of shame and reason . You have brought us to this impasse ; you have necessitated this drastic action . " <p> Unable to think of a reply , James whimpered , a fresh wave of tears spilling down his cheeks . <p> " And if you are responsible for what is happening to you , then who do you think can stop it ? Come on : you 're dallying . " <p> " Me , " James gasped , " I can make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daresay the answer was a bit obvious . Oh well , even the easy questions need answering . Yes , it 's you , Mr. Williamson , James : it 's you who can make this better or , " the Editor paused , " worse . Do you want to know what you have to do ? " <p> James nodded . <p> " Speak up , Mr. Williamson : I ca n't hear your head rattle . " <p> " Yes , " James managed . <p> " Good . There are a number of solutions to your dilemma . The first and most obvious is that you learn your place and accept it . Enough of this nonsense you 've been passing off on your professor : from now on , you do what he wants you to . Embrace your role as a tyro . I realize that you may find yourself constitutionally incapable of abandoning your beloved metier , the fantastic . We can accommodate that : there is always a place for escapism . It must be escapism , however ; it should fit nicely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whatever you decide to write , clean up your language , - it 's all there for you in Strunk and White . <p> " Should neither of these options prove acceptable , for one reason or another , there are still more choices open to us . You can abandon fiction for nonfiction , for history , say . Feed the public 's desire for trivia . Write a nice biography . No one takes the past seriously . There is also silence . You may choose to lay down the pen , to step back from the keyboard . If anyone asks why , you can appeal to the morality of silence ; you 'd be amazed at how successful we 've been at selling that one . <p> " If none of these will do , then I 'm afraid the decision will default back to us . And our choice , while effective , will be less than pleasant . Do you understand ? " <p> " Yes , " James whispered . <p> " I fear our little demonstration is going to have to continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that , once you have left my office and returned to the relative safety of your dorm room , you may find a way to convince yourself that none of this happened , that it was all a bad dream . We ca n't have that , Mr. Williamson , can we ? " <p> " I 'll remember , " James said , " I 'll remember I swear I 'll remember I promise . " <p> " Of course you do . Who would n't , in your situation ? Such pledges are n't enough , I fear . There needs to be a memory sufficiently intense and unpleasant to give your oaths the requisite foundation . " <p> " No , " James pleaded , " no come on please . " <p> " Do n't worry , " the Editor said , and pulled the letter opener out of the manuscript . <p> Instantly , the searing agony in James 's chest was gone , so completely it might never have been there . He could feel his heart pounding , filling the space that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ; he could breathe again . His body , which had been contracted around the pain , relaxed all at once , as if he had been submerged in a warm bath . Eyes closed , he slumped back in his chair . <p> " Your attention , please , Mr. Williamson , " the Editor said . " I want you to see this . " <p> Although he would have been blissfully content to remain as he was for the next week or so , a jolt of fear surged up James 's spine , opening his eyes and straightening him in his seat . The Editor , he saw , was holding the undersized gladius point down over the manuscript . The lower half of the sword was dripping a thick , richly red liquid that almost resembled blood . The manuscript on the desk was marked by the same viscous substance , which pooled at the spot where the letter opener had stabbed it . The Editor said , " All is text , Mr. Williamson . At this moment , we have the text . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have the text , " James repeated , " yes . " <p> " It 's quite the opportunity you 're being given , I hope you realize . Play your proper role , and you will number among those helping the cause of order . Who knows ? Your influence could be profound . Perhaps , at some point , your involvement in our struggle might become more ... direct . You are valuable to us , Mr. Williamson ; you are worth so much more to us healthy and writing than otherwise . You 've already demonstrated such spirit tonight , spirit that only needs to be given the proper outlet . It would be a terrible shame to see you go to waste . However - " the Editor raised the letter opener . James had sufficient time to see the bloody tip of the undersized sword poised over the bloody pages and know what was waiting to descend on him ; he had sufficient time to look closely into the Editor 's eyes and see that his pupils were the elongated pupils of a goat 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a mask ; he 's wearing a mask and gloves . Then the letter opener drove into the manuscript with a thunk . <p> It was as if he had been stabbed in the neck , from his Adam 's apple through to his spine . Gagging , he convulsed in his chair , flopping out of it and onto the floor . Dimly , he felt his knee , his head strike concrete . His hands clutched at his throat , trying to tear it free of what was n't there . He heard a pop as the Editor wrenched the letter opener from the desk , and in the sudden absence of pain sucked in great whoops of air . Then another thunk , and his right leg felt as if it had been cut clean to the bone . James howled , grabbing at his thigh even as a second pop heralded the end of that hurt and a third thunk brought fireworks of agony bursting deep in his gut . His back ; his side : he writhed as the Editor lanced him like a sadistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter opener thunked through the manuscript with mechanical rhythm , and with each blow a new part of James 's body screamed with abuse : his face ; his foot ; his eye ; his groin ; his knee . With each stab , he could feel himself tearing , as if he were so much paper yielding to the Editor 's blows . His kidney flared nova-bright , and he was paper ; he felt himself part before the blade the way a sheet of heavy-bond typing paper would . Thunk. he was paper . Thunk. he was paper . Thunk . Paper . <p> " I think that should do , " the Editor said , and , for the final time , the pain went away . James lay on the floor , trembling , his voice screamed out . He had lost count of the number of times he had heard metal bite into wood : a dozen ? twice that ? more ? The Editor loomed above . James looked up and saw his head floating overhead like a helium balloon . It did not seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the head said , and James obeyed , climbing up on legs that wobbled like a comedian 's . When he stood , he saw that the Editor 's head had rejoined his body . The Editor 's face , shirt , and coat were splattered with scarlet spray . The manuscript lay on the desk before him , ragged with holes , each one oozing blood . The letter opener lay to one side of it , washed in red to the hilt . " Here endeth the lesson , " the Editor said pleasantly . " You understand what is required of you ? " <p> James croaked , " Yes . " <p> " Good . I could ask you to repeat everything I told you , but that panicked look is its own reward . I trust we wo n't see you again , Mr. Williamson . " <p> " No , " James said , " you wo n't . " <p> " Glad to hear it . You can see yourself out . There is a door to the right as you leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a short cut . That 's just between us , though . " <p> " Yes , " James said . <p> " And , " the Editor held out his hand , and he was holding James 's story , the way a hunter might hold the carcass of his latest kill , his bloody fingers smearing its white pages . <p> James stared at it . <p> " What would you like me to do with this ? " <p> James shook his head . <p> " As I told you before , Mr. Williamson , I can not hear your head rattle . You 'll have to speak up . " <p> " Do what you want , " James finally said . " I do n't care . " <p> " Very well , " the Editor said , and let the story fall flapping into the garbage can beside his desk . " That 's good riddance to bad rubbish , would n't you say ? " <p> " Yes , " James said . <p> " Good . Now get out , boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . " <p> Leaving the office on legs still shaking , James saw the door the Editor had mentioned to his right . He heaved it open , and stepped out into the quad in front of the Humanities building . Given the number of stairs he had descended , he should have felt shocked , he knew , but after the night 's other marvels and terrors , this one seemed so much cheap parlor magic . A mob of students swelled past him on its way to town and the alcoholic pleasures of Pete 's Corner Pub , their mingled shouts and laughter crowding the air . He watched them pass . The night air was cool on his skin , which continued to tingle . Above , a few stars competed in vain with a half-moon tilted to one side , like a silver cup pouring down radiance . As he stood there , feeling time expand , hearing the faint honks of distant car horns , James felt something loosen in his chest . He tried to arrest it , but was too tired to resist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sitting on the ground , sobbing tears he had not believed he had left in him . Passersby sped up as they neared him . One girl with red hair and a long , fur-trimmed coat stopped to bend over and ask him if he was all right ; he waved her on . Eventually , he rose and staggered to his dorm room on legs made numb from sitting for so long . <p> The next day , James went to his advisor and made the necessary arrangements to drop Creative Writing I. Asked for his reason , he explained that he was doing poorly in the class , on the verge of failing , and had decided that Creative Writing was n't for him . When his advisor asked him what was for him , James answered , Economics . His advisor congratulated him on his sensible choice . Although James had not told his parents of his hope of majoring in Creative Writing , they were happy to learn of his decision to pursue Economics . <p> Midway through the following semester , however , during a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in capitalism , James noticed his pen beginning to write sentences in the margins of his notebook . The sentences began , " Once upon a time , " and , " To say the man was fat , " and , " Everything about this man came to a point . " Realizing what he was doing , he scribbled out the sentences frantically , his heart knocking . But after a day passed with no reprisals - a day James spent ceaselessly glancing from side to side , starting at loud noises , feeling the skin between his shoulder blades tingle as if someone were targeting a rifle on it - and then another , and finally a third , he could n't help himself : he wrote a short short story on the inside back page of his Biology notebook while he should have been learning cell mitosis . It was followed by a longer piece in the same notebook two classes later , and another short short story in his Art History notebook that emerged during an extended slide lecture on eighteenth-century English landscape painters . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inventing weaknesses for them , liabilities . All was text , the Editor had said , what was written wove the world . Exactly how it did so James was unsure . Did Sean feel his suit of skin loosen ever so slightly ? Did Raymond notice more and more people looking at him , their expressions confused , as if they had momentarily glimpsed something terrible ? Did the Editor notice that the dimensions of his office seemed to be changing , that it appeared to be shrinking around him ? Impossible to say ; though he suspected that , eventually , somehow , his words would have to find print . <p> He wrote every day , quickly , hunched over his desk , one eye open to everyone and everything around him . <p> Author Affiliation
