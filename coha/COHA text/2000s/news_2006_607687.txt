<p> Joey Cheek was 14 years old and sitting on his living room floor , his eyes glued to the TV broadcast of the 1994 Winter Olympics , when his life 's mission became clear . Norway 's famed speedskater Johann Olav Koss was shattering one world record after another en route to winning three gold medals at the Lillehammer Games , and Cheek , a top junior in-line skater at the time , turned to his mother and said , " That 's what I want to do next . " <p> Monday at the Turin Olympics , Cheek fulfilled his dream of following in Koss 's vaunted steps in more ways than one . The North Carolina native blistered the slow , sticky ice at the Lingotto Oval to win gold in the 500-meter speedskating event . Then , he held reporters ' questions at bay at the start of his post-race news conference to announce that he was taking another cue from his idol and donating the $25,000 he would receive from the U.S. Olympic Committee for having won gold to the charitable organization Koss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and games as a tool for helping children in the most needy corners of the world . <p> Cheek said his donation would be earmarked specifically for children of the Darfur region in Sudan , where roughly 60,000 youngsters have been displaced , and he called on corporate sponsors of the Olympic Games to match his contribution . <p> " For me , the Olympics has been the greatest blessing , " said Cheek , 26 , who also won bronze in the 1,000 at the 2002 Salt Lake City Games . " If I retired yesterday , I 'd have gotten everything in the world from speedskating and from competing in the Olympics . So for me , to walk away today with the gold medal is just amazing . And the best way I can say thanks that I can think of is to try and help somebody else . " <p> Cheek said he had lain awake at night in the athletes ' village in Turin , staring at the ceiling and contemplating how to do something constructive with the platform and reward that an Olympic medal might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was afraid to jinx his chances by plotting too much . But just as he had learned to set a goal and make a plan for reaching it as a young athlete , he decided to plan a charitable action if the occasion arose . <p> So he reached out to Koss , the speedskating **25;1338;TOOLONG , who had started an athlete-drive charitable movement by donating his winnings from the 1994 Games to buy sports equipment for the children of the war-torn African nation Eritrea . Cheek wanted to get involved with Right to Play , and he discussed his idea with Koss . Then he went out and skated the race of his life . <p> The 500 meters is the shortest event in speedskating , in which competitors race 1 1/4 laps around the oval in pairs . Then , after less than an hour 's break , they race the same distance again . Medals are awarded based on the fastest combined time . <p> Cheek , the defending world sprint champion , was among a handful of favorites . But he faced formidable competition in Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance ; Jeremy Wotherspoon of Canada , a four-time World Cup winner at the distance ; and Russia 's Dmitry Dorofeyev . <p> Speedskaters have complained that the ice in Turin is slow  --  an unavoidable consequence , some say in defense of the Olympic host , of the surface being at sea level compared to the higher elevation of Salt Lake City . Cheek was unfazed , skating a flawless first race . He bolted to his fastest start all season , took a shrewd line around the oval and kept his frame tucked low throughout , which is n't easy for a 6-foot-1 speedskater . But even he could n't believe the time that flashed on the scoreboard  --  34.82 seconds , making him the only skater to beat 35 seconds . <p> That gave Cheek a lead of nearly 0.40 of a second heading into the second race  --  a margin unheard of in an event in which the outcome is typically settled by hundredths of a second . <p> Former Olympic champion Bonnie Blair could n't recall a lead so commanding in a sprint . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " You 'd have to go back . . . . To have that big of a gap  --  it has n't happened as long I can remember . " <p> Said Wotherspoon , who was second in the 500 at the 1998 Games and would likely have won in 2002 had it not been for a crash : " If that was me , if I had a gap that big on anyone , I would be going into the second race thinking the only way I ca n't win the gold medal is if I really screw up bad . That 's how big a gap that is . " <p> For Cheek , the margin was both blessing and curse . <p> " I just had to be close in the second race , and I 'd still win , " Cheek said . " But that 's kind of poison when you 're a speedskater . You do n't want to think that way because it makes you kind of soft . I 've spent years and years training for this , and I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every time I did , I try and learn something from it . " <p> Cheek found the balance he needed , attacking the second race with only hint of restraint . Once again he was the only skater to break the 35-second barrier , finishing with a combined time of 69.76 seconds . Dorofeyev , the Russian , took silver ( 70.41 ) , while South Korea 's Kang Seok Lee took bronze ( 70.43 ) . <p> Cheek threw his arms in the air when the scoreboard flashed his championship time , then grabbed an American flag and circled the ice as tears streamed down his face . <p> In the stands were his girlfriend , his brother and his very proud mother , who had n't hesitated for a minute when he asked to leave the family 's home in Greensboro , N.C. , at age 16 and move to Calgary to train to become a world-class speedskater . Only years later , after she went through some old family photographs , did Chris Cheek realize how young her son had been when he left home . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he could n't do it in North Carolina , " Chris Cheek said . " If it 's a dream , and they want to do it , let ' em go . " <p> Within an hour of achieving that dream , Joey Cheek let it go . He 'll retire from speedskating after these Olympics , he announced , and enroll in college in the fall to study economics . Harvard rejected his early-decision application , apprehensive about his 10-year hiatus from formal schooling . He 's hoping Columbia , Georgetown , New York University , North Carolina or Duke comes through . <p> " I sort of figured with the shotgun approach , maybe I 'll hit one , " Cheek said with a self-deprecating chuckle . With luck , his next hurdle will be finding a way to finance an Ivy League education with an amateur athlete 's bank account . But Monday night was n't a night to worry about the future . It was a night to give thanks for the past and present . <p> " I 've always dreamt that I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think on some level , it 's empowering to think of someone other than myself . What I do is just great fun . I love what I do ; it 's a great job . I 've seen the entire world , and I 've met amazing friends . But it 's honestly a pretty ridiculous thing : I mean , I skate around on ice in tights . <p> " So if you keep in perspective , I 've trained my whole life for this , but it 's not that big a deal . But because I 've skated well , and because I know I have two seconds of microphone-time , I have the ability to hopefully raise some awareness and raise some money and maybe , God willing , put some kids on a path that I 've been blessed with .
