Kim Strong , 41 and eight months pregnant , lies down on four armless chairs shoved together in the far corner of a conference room at Montefiore Medical Center 's Comprehensive Family Care facility in the Bronx , N.Y . She lifts up her T shirt , lowers her pants and watches obstetrician Liza Kunz squirt gel on her big , full belly . As the doctor slides a fetal heart monitor across her skin , Strong is n't the only one listening carefully for the reassuring sound of a baby 's heartbeat . Gathered in the room with her are four equally pregnant women . They all arrived as a group to have their obstetrics checkup together . <P> For American patients used to thinking of a doctor 's appointment as a private , one-on-one affair , the idea of a roomful of strangers discussing something as intimate as the progress of their pregnancy may seem strange . But look at it this way : Would you rather wait an hour or two to see your doctor for 10 minutes or meet at a prearranged time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients  --  for two hours ? <P> More and more doctors and their patients are opting for the latter . Patients enjoy the support and encouragement of people who are in the same boat they are , and get to ask the questions that often slip their mind in the rush of a short appointment . Doctors appreciate the efficiency of giving better information and care to many more patients a day , up to three times their previous number . <P> " This is an important part of the future of medicine , " says health psychologist Ed Noffsinger , who introduced shared appointments to California 's giant Kaiser Permanente system in 1996 , and is now a full-time consultant in the field . " Most doctors are still using a system that was developed in an era of acute care , when we did n't even have antibiotics . It 's a mistake to believe that same model is the best way of looking after people . " <P> The idea Noffsinger has been championing is rapidly catching on across the country , from rural Tennessee to South Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Fla. , introduced group appointments in the summer of 2002 as a way to combat a backlog of 17,000 patients waiting to be inducted into its primary-care system . Today that waiting list hovers at about 100 , and the group model is being extended to Veterans Health Administration centers around the country . Endocrinologist David Shewmon started group appointments in his Wooster , Ohio , practice last January and has reduced the wait time for a follow-up appointment from six months to about a week . In Kalamazoo , Mich. , internist Ed Millermaier can get you in for a shared physical next week , but if you want an individual appointment , there 's a four-month wait . <P> Group appointments allow doctors to see more patients a day  --  and , in many cases , make more money  --  and advocates argue that these physicians also provide superior care . A Kaiser study by pioneer John Scott , who introduced groups to Colorado in 1991 , randomly allocated elderly patients to group or individual care and found that after two years , those who attended the groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hospital admissions , were more likely to get flu and pneumonia shots , and cost Kaiser about $50 a patient less each month .
