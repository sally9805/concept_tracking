Headnote THE SECRET TO TURNING A BUNCH OF PLANTS INTO A TRAFFIC-STOPPING ORGANIC FLOWER GARDEN IS TO MATCH THEM WITH THEIR IDEAL MATES . Spring is a glorious time for flower gardeners , as we revel in the vivid colors of blooming bulbs , perennials , shrubs , vines , and trees . But spring also presents a challenge : With so many flowers to choose from , which should you plant to transform your beds and borders into the landscape you dream of ? On these pages , you 'll see combinations that deliver the beauty you crave and the organic bonus of being drought-tolerant , easy-care , native , or bird-friendly . Now , that 's the perfect partnership we all wish for . SAY IT WITH FOLIAGE Earlier in spring , these swirly sccdheads were the purple blossoms of pasque flower ( Pulsatilla vulraris ) . Paired with " Palace Purple " coral bells ( Heuchera ) and a taller but equally feathery grass ( Festuca ovina var. glauca ) , they make a textural combination that 's as winsome in a bouquet as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IN BLUE Blue flowers are calming to look at , so include them in your natural landscape . Here , woodland phlox and columbine-a prolific self-seeder-surround a birdbath . Hellebore foliage , a hardy geranium with magenta flowers , and a variegated hosta draw your attention to more woodland phlox in the background . Growing Tip : Shrubs ( like nandina and goldstem dogwood , below ) protected with a layer of mulch are larger , more vigorous , and more likely to survive their first year than unmulched plants , report researchers at Washington State University . TREE OF A KIND A well-chosen tree , like this river birch ( resistant to the destructive bronze birch borer ) , gives your flower border a more authentic look . The birch 's exfoliating bark makes an exquisite backdrop to the orange petals and yellow stamens of the native columbine . During the summer , Culver 's root ( Veronicastrum virginicum-the foliage behind the tree-will use the trunk as a prop for its white spires . The iris leaves in the foreground promise that the colorful show will continue later in spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low-growing shrubs in ordinary landscapes , but you can see here how natural " Hans Anrud " tulips and Spirea X bumalda " Gold Flame " look together . Periwinkle ( Vinca minor ) makes the scenario look unfussed . For another stunning shrub/bulb combo , try redtwig dogwood , pink-centered daffodils , and Siberian squill , suggests Kris Jarantoski of the Chicago Botanic Garden . BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE Red coral-bell flowers stand out against the gray stone in this rock garden . The emerging nandina foliage , copper now , turns the same hue as the blue-green columbine leaves in front of it . These plants are stunning , but they also are about as easy-care and pest- and disease-free as gardening gets . Growing Tip : The very tips of plants ' roots take up most water and nutrients , and link to essential soil microbes . Handle the delicate root tips gently when planting perennials , such as pasque flower and blue fescue , right . SOME LIKE IT DAMP You can enjoy vibrant spring color even in your most challenging sites . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and candelabra primroses , which thrive in consistently moist ( but not waterlogged ) soil . Behind them , moisture-loving rodgersia has leaves big enough for a dinosaur 's lunch . JADE IN THE SHADE Introduce one bright color to light up an all-green garden . In this shady space , apricot tulips flicker like flames above a green foliage sea . The shapes and textures of the leaves would n't be nearly as distinctive without that conga line of happy tulips . This is one instance where planting in a row succeeds ( but notice the uneven spacing , which keeps the composition from looking as if it belongs in front of a municipal building ) . The secret ingredient that gives this planting its punch : The tulip bulbs were planted beneath coral bells with purple-almost black-leaves . RETURN OF THE NATIVES Plant flowers native to your region . They 're adapted to your soil and weather , so they thrive without coddling , look beautiful , and attract pollinators . This California garden is filled with ( what else ? ) California poppies , underplanted with meadow foam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing the work for you . Find spring-blooming plants native to your region at the Plant Conservation Alliance Web site , nps.gov/plants . NOW YOU SEE IT , NOW YOU DO N'T The cleverest plant combinations not only look terrific ; they camouflage , too . In this Georgia garden , " Menton " tulips , woodland phlox ( Phlox divaricata ) , and star of Bethlehem ( Ornithogalum umbellatum ) grab the attention . But look closely , and you 'll glimpse the foliage of the poppies , irises , and larkspurs to follow . The leaves and flowers of the up-and-comers will hide the yellowing foliage of the plants presently blooming . You can also use hostas , peonies , and black-eyed Susans to hide fading foliage . Growing Tip : Plant perennials , like geraniums and hostas , below , with their crowns ( the place where the shoots meet the roots ) slightly above the soil surface , say researchers at Cornell University 's Flower Bulb Research Program .
