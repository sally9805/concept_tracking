He was the last person she ever wanted to see again . She 'd done her time , she was out now . For good . Free . Free to be whatever she wanted to be , and what she wanted to be was alone . <p> It had been three years since they 'd parted ways , and not under the best of circumstances . Derek Cole had been her boss then ; the man who decided where she went , what she did , and how long she stayed . To say he had n't been happy with her decision to resign would be putting it mildly . Too damn bad , had been her feeling at the time . The intervening years had done nothing to change that sentiment . <p> Tate Winslow did n't just like her newfound solitude , she reveled in it . Home used to be wherever she laid her hat . And her gun . Now home was the stunning vistas and peaceful beauty of the Hebron Valley , framed by the gently rolling Blue Ridge Mountains in Madison County @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous life . She went by Tara Wingate now . Not a stunning change , she 'd tried to keep some sense of herself , but change enough to start fresh , leaving no tracks . Hers was a privately designed protection program created by someone who knew firsthand how to make a person disappear . Her former boss had n't been pleased with her choice , but he 'd respected it and her request for help in creating a new life for herself . She 'd made certain no one here knew of her past ... and he 'd made certain no one from her past knew she was here . There had been no contact since and there would be no contact . Ever . <p> She 'd come here battered in both body and soul , desperately in need of healing . She 'd expected it to take time , and was willing to give herself whatever it was she needed to feel whole again . She 'd given enough to others . It was time to take a little back for herself . Not that she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left to give . <p> Surprisingly , adjusting to the quiet life in the valley had come easily , and the healing had followed more swiftly than she 'd imagined possible . She 'd found her rhythm quite naturally here , the slower pace of life calling to her in more ways than she 'd known were possible . She 'd only wanted a break , an escape , a place to lick her wounds and heal in private . She had n't known the true depths of solace there was to be found in such a new way of life , but was profoundly grateful for every scrap of it . She had n't realized how much faith and trust-two commodities she 'd never had in large supply-that she 'd put into it always being there for her . Until the instant it all changed . <p> The adrenaline pumping into her system right now was the exact opposite of everything she 'd come here for , everything she 'd become . It made her physically nauseous . Worse was the ease with which her training kicked right back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever again , made her emotionally sick . And mad as hell . <p> It was a brutal revelation , discovering her peaceful existence could be so easily and swiftly shattered by something as simple as a rattling doorknob . Three years in the valley had healed wounds , soothed scars , and introduced her to a world where joy was found in morning blooms and evening bird calls . But apparently no amount of soul-soothing would ever erase the training ingrained into her from her previous life . A life where distinguishing between , and identifying , even the tiniest of sounds could mean the difference between life and death . <p> So when the rattling sound came , she knew it was n't the wind whistling over the shaker roof and vibrating the frame of her log cabin home . She had made casual friends of a few neighbors since moving here , but not a single one of them would have come calling after midnight without advance notice ... even in an emergency . She had no family , no relatives . No one who would simply enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And yet , someone was at her door . A door no one from her previous life should know existed . Or certainly not where it existed . Derek had n't been happy she 'd left the team , but he 'd promised he 'd allow her the permanent exile she sought . And though he 'd been a tough boss , he 'd never expected anything from his team that he had n't taken , or could n't take , himself . He never shied away from making a blunt observation , and he never made promises because he knew reality did n't always come with the luxury of keeping them . So , when he gave his word , he backed it up . Without fail . <p> The return of that sickening , heart-pounding sensation , where every second was crystallized into a completely separate , fully realized moment in time , was something she 'd never wanted to experience , ever again . But , in less than five seconds , she had palmed her gun from under the corner of her mattress-a security blanket , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of nowhere-and had her back flat against the wall next to her bedroom door . She hated this , hated it with a deepening rage that was almost as bone-chilling as the sound that had launched her into it . <p> Drawing on every shred of training she 'd had , fury mounted as she made her way out of her only bedroom , and crept down the short hall to the front room . She paused to peek around the corner , making a slow visual sweep of her small cabin , then moved in along the front wall . Staying low to the ground , she peered cautiously out of the panoramic front window , silently cursing the lack of night vision goggles , hating that she 'd even thought of it . She 'd bought the cabin mainly for that window , and the view of the valley and the endless rippling vistas of blue mountains that it showcased . The idea that someone was out there , using the very same window to stare in at her , made her even more livid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward shooting first and asking questions later , when a hushed , gravelly voice whispered , " Tate . It 's me . " <p> She went stock still , her heart lodged instantly in her throat . Hearing her old name .. knowing only one person could connect the woman living in this cabin to that name , only increased her fury . She knew that voice . Knew it belonged to a man who was quite capable of getting himself into any structure he wanted to . So why was he rattling her door knob ? Unless ... <p> She crept closer , and positioned herself on the hinged side of the door . Not smart , but Derek would expect her to do as she 'd been trained . Especially considering he 'd been the one to do the training . It was the smallest of edges , but with him she 'd need every one she had . She did n't respond . <p> " Tate . Let me in . " There was a long pause , then a choked , " Please . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> He had to be in trouble . The most serious kind . And of all the places in the world he could go and drag that trouble with him , he 'd chosen her doorstep . <p> " How dare you , " she hissed , not intending to speak at all , but her rage at his gall robbed her of her better judgment . <p> " Had no choice . " <p> " There are always choices . " <p> " Open the door . I haven't-I can't- " <p> There was a thump against the door , as if his body weight had collapsed against it . Or the body weight of someone else . Holy Mother of-if he 'd brought some wounded team member to her door , thinking she would play doctor- <p> " I will shoot you both if you so much as set foot inside this house . Find somewhere else to bleed to death . Anywhere else . " To anyone else , the comment would seem callous at best , heartless at worst , but they had all been trained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in exceedingly impossible situations . Every single time they went to work , they put their lives on the line , knowing every mission could be their last . The risks sucked , and nobody wanted to die , but that was part of the job . And the other part of the job was to accept those risks ... and never put innocent bystanders in danger in order to save yourself . You 'd inserted yourself willingly into a potentially deadly situation . They had n't . <p> There was a grunt . Then another thump . " Just me , Tate . " Another thump , then a scraping sound . " Just me . " <p> She leaned against the wall of the cabin , willing her racing heart and even more swiftly racing mind to slow down long enough so she could think and act clearly . " It 's Tara . I do n't work for you any longer , and I sure as hell do n't owe you anything . Get off my property , Derek . " <p> " Ca n't . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Short of calling the authorities or putting him out of his misery right there on her front porch , there was going to be no way to get rid of him . She looked at the small table on the other side of the door , and the drawer where she kept a charged cell phone . She 'd only gotten it for emergency purposes . Otherwise she did n't need one . There was no one to call , and no one who would call her . But if anything constituted an emergency it was this . Only without knowing the parameters of the mission that had driven him to her doorstep , even calling the locals to haul an apparent unknown trespasser off her property could unwittingly put others in danger . Which meant she could n't make that call , and she hated him even more because he damn well knew it . <p> " You need to be anywhere else but here , " she informed him . <p> " It 's about CJ . " <p> Tate 's heart stopped all together . A split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dragging a half-hunched , half-crumpled Derek into her living room . He grunted when she left him to lie where she 'd dragged him , stepping over his prone body to close the door , unable to tell , in the pitch darkness , whether he 'd left any telltale signs of his presence on her porch . Like a backpack . Or a pool of blood . <p> She rolled him to his side , not particularly caring what injuries he 'd sustained-and it was clear he was n't healthy at the moment-or how much worse she might be making them by her rough handling . She gripped the collar of his black , Kevlar-lined jacket and yanked up so his face turned up toward hers . " CJ is dead . I saw her . " <p> " You were wrong , " he choked out . <p> " Wrong ? " She shook him , stunned , beyond even fury now , unable to process the whole of what was happening . Her training might never wane , but she was n't as mentally sharp as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be happy-proud , even-to know that about herself . It was n't healthy to have your brain wired to register , analyze , and process life-or-death information in an instant , and do so as if it were as natural as breathing . " Wrong how ? I saw her . I know I 'm not wrong . She 's dead , Derek . Has been since three days before they pulled me out of that godforsaken village . " <p> " No , " was all he managed . <p> " How could that be ? Is this some kind of sick hoax ? How dare you come here and- " She made herself stop , and swallowed hard , jaw so tight it ached . " Tell me , all of it , right now , or so help me , God- " <p> " They still had her . After you ... she was still there . Is still . " <p> Tate 's grip loosened . " No , " she said , the whisper sounding like it had been tortured out of her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her fingers went completely slack . His head thumping against the floor barely registered as wave upon wave of unwanted memories flooded her mind . " It 's been three years , " she said , her voice toneless now , hollow , as she fought against the swiftly resurfacing past and the wave of nausea that accompanied it . The fury that had built up inside her fled so quickly it left her feeling lightheaded . <p> Think about CJ . Not ... not what had happened back then . <p> Back there . <p> CJ . Alive . She simply could n't put that together . Not in any rational way . <p> She looked at Derek , who had n't moved . Her eyes had adjusted to the low light , but it was still too dark to make out much . He was in significant pain , that much was certain . Tough shit , she thought , resisting with all her might the avalanche of nightmares that were piled up behind a mental door she 'd very carefully , and very thoroughly , closed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she choked out . " How do you know this ? " <p> " Not ... now , " Derek ground out . " Not yet . I'm-I 've been ... " He grunted as he struggled to lift his head on his own , scan his surroundings . <p> " I 'm not bugged , " she retorted sharply , thankful for the sudden resurgence of fury . " No one has been here . " <p> " I have . " <p> Her throat closed over as the new reality she was trying to stave off battered its way through her carefully constructed walls . <p> He 'd been here . In her space . <p> Her world here , her life , was truly compromised , then . She wanted to shake him , hard , wanted to scream and shout and inflict pain , the likes of which he was inflicting on her . " How dare you ! " she half-sobbed , half-growled . <p> " Better me , " he managed , his voice , what there was of it , wavering badly as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could barely make out his features , but it looked like he had his eyes squeezed shut . <p> Interrogation and detainment rule number one : never shut your eyes . Never . <p> " Derek- " <p> " Than them , " he finished , then his head rolled to the side and his jaw went slack . <p> " Derek ? " She leaned over him again . Despite her earlier threats , her heart tripped . " Do n't you go dying right in my foyer , dammit . You 've already brought enough trouble to my door . You 're not about to leave me to figure out what to do about it by myself . " She pressed her palm to his cheek , turning his face to hers , trying to catch what little moonlight there was so she could better assess his condition . She did n't dare turn on so much as a flashlight until she learned more about what she was up against . The muscles in his face had gone slack , but his eyes were closed , and she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive . " Good , " she breathed , relaxing a little . She turned his face a bit more toward the spare wash of moonlight coming in through the front window . " Do n't think that means I wo n't personally strangle you , though , " she warned , leaning closer to get a better look . <p> He 'd either taken a hell of a fall , or a hell of a beating . She was betting on the latter . There was a gash over his left eyebrow . A black and blue contusion swelling over his right cheekbone . The corner of his mouth was dried with caked blood , and his chin was all scraped to hell . And that 's just what she could make out in next-to-no-lighting . It was also a bitch of a time to notice how thick and dark his eyelashes were . <p> She lowered his head back to the floor and rocked back on her heels to look over the rest of him . He was five years her senior , which put him at thirty-eight now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through had left an indelible stamp on her , aging her in body , mind , and soul , whatever he 'd been through in the past three-plus years-or hell , even in the past three days-had n't diminished one iota of his natural , God-given beauty . Of which he 'd always had an abundance . Did n't change the fact that he was a hard-ass , son-of-a-bitch who 'd just compromised her whole world . And , quite probably , her life . <p> " Derek , " she repeated , sharply this time . " Do n't fade on me now . I need to know why you 're here , all of it , and what the hell happened to you . " She leaned over him again , and debated on doing a quick once-over with her hands to see if he was bleeding . He was lying in an awkward position , and she wished she had more light so she could get a better idea if he was suffering from any obvious fractures or dislocations . She refused to feel bad for her rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furious with him , it was n't in her to totally disregard his condition . Besides , she needed him to be alert so she could get information out of him . He 'd sounded pretty out of it , which made her worry that he 'd suffered something more than just a good ass-kicking . <p> She tried not to think about how he 'd let himself even get in that position . He was better than that . But then , she 'd been better than that , too . Sometimes , even the best were n't good enough . <p> She started to slowly move his arm , hoping she could ease him over to his back , when she realized that the reason he was lying so awkwardly was because his wrists were bound behind his back . Shit . <p> She scooted around behind him , staying low to the floor , well below the line of view through the window . The cords wrapping his wrists together had been tied off neatly and thoroughly . A professional job . Her gut squeezed as a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonds slightly , but from what she could feel of the skin around the cords , he 'd paid a price for that , too . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
