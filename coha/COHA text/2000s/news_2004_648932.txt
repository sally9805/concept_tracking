<p> One thing has become clear in the All-Star selections : N.B.A. Commissioner David Stern is not the puppeteer that conspiracy theorists have made him out to be . <p> When the rookie sensations LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony were left off the All-Star rosters , people started to let go of the idea that Stern pulls strings for the brightest stars . But now that that has been settled , next Sunday 's All-Star Game will still be without the league 's two brightest young stars , each worthy of All-Star honors at 19 years of age . <p> Russ Granik , the deputy commissioner , said the league recognized the added sizzle James and Anthony would have brought to the game , which will be played at Staples Center in Los Angeles . But he added that the league was satisfied with the decisions of the fans , who chose the 10 starters , and the coaches , who selected the 14 reserves . <p> " We think this is just fine , if that 's the way the coaches see it , " Granik said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention over the weekend , and everyone expects them to be in many All-Star Games before they 're through . " <p> James , averaging 21 points and nearly 6 assists and 6 rebounds a game , and Anthony , who has led Denver to a surprising contending role in the Western Conference , will have to settle for playing in Saturday 's Rookie Challenge , which pits first-year players against second-year players . <p> There is still a possibility that James or Anthony will participate in the All-Star Game as a replacement for an injured player . <p> Last Tuesday , James said he would refuse such an invitation , saying : " If I was n't part of the ones they picked at first , I would n't even like to be a part of the team . I 'm an only child ; I never want to be picked second . I do n't come second . " <p> He backed off that statement the next day and said he would probably play if asked . <p> James and Anthony are not the only players with legitimate gripes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second-best point guard in the league behind Jason Kidd . And what about Zach Randolph , Mike Bibby , Latrell Sprewell , Antoine Walker and Richard Hamilton ? <p> But who could be replaced ? Michael Redd , who was picked , has been outstanding in leading left-for-dead Milwaukee into playoff position in the East . <p> " I love the people who write or say this guy should 've made it , but never tell you instead of who , " Granik said . " I think you could make a very good case for LeBron or Carmelo , but when you look at the positions they play , it makes it harder . The guards in the East are very strong , and the forwards in the West are very strong . It 's hard to say that LeBron should 've been on instead of the guys that did make it . " <p> The league could consider increasing the number of All-Stars from each conference to 15 from 12 . After all , there are 29 N.B.A. teams now , and next season there will be 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were named among the 22 All-Stars as rookies , there were 22 teams . <p> But Granik said the All-Star roster would not expand along with the league . " It 's purely a playing-time issue , " he said . " It 's hard enough to get all 12 players in the game . You almost wish you could honor a few more guys but tell them to stay home . " <p> About a dozen years ago , the N.B.A. considered naming four All-Star teams , one for each division . The teams would have faced off in an All-Star tournament . <p> " But there was a sense that we were trying to do too much , " Granik said . " We 've already got a lot of other events around the game . We do n't want to put too many layers on it . We like the game the way it is . " <p> Bird Likes Age Requirement <p> Larry Bird , the Indiana Pacers ' president of basketball operations , has three players on his roster who entered the N.B.A. out of high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 or 21 . <p> " I wish they would put in an age requirement because it 's hurting college and definitely , in the long run , it 's going to hurt our game , " he said . <p> Bird said it was hard to get a legitimate read on young players . The Pacers benefited from that problem in the case of Jermaine O'Neal , who sat on the bench for four seasons in Portland before blossoming into an All-Star in Indiana . <p> With that in mind , the Pacers are being careful not to give up on Jonathan Bender , a fifth-year swingman who they believe has star potential . The 6-foot-11 Bender has played sparingly , but Bird said next season would be Bender 's chance to prove himself . <p> " Jonathan has all the ability in the world , but not all the fundamentals of how to play the game , " Bird said . " We need to go back to square one and learn how to play the game this summer , and he 's willing to do that . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's time to take the next step . Next year , we 'll see what kind of player he really is . " <p> Bird said he was conflicted about scouting high school players . " I 've been in high school gyms this year and I felt guilty about being there , " he said . " But if everybody else is there , you 've got to be there . " <p> He does not envy officials in the National Football League , which may encounter similar issues after the the Maurice Clarett ruling opened the door for younger players . <p> " That will open the floodgates to high school kids , " Bird said . " No question about it . If they leave the door open , they 'll come . That 's not good for college football . " <p> McKie Does n't Forget <p> Count Philadelphia 's Aaron McKie among the players who aspire to coach after their playing days are over . But he wants to coach in high school . <p> " People have said things to me about coaching in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But what helped me in my life the most was having my mentor , my high school coach , working with me a lot . I think a lot of people get away from that . This is the glorified part of being an athlete  --  the N.B.A. But my focus would be with the younger kids and having them understand life , having them understand education and basketball  --  how to play it , have fun and learn to work as a team and as a unit . " <p> Coach Bill Ellerbee at Simon Gratz High School in Philadelphia became something of a father figure to McKie after his father died when he was 8 and his mother abandoned him when he was a teenager . McKie wants to become a father figure to those in need , not those in the N.B.A. " That 's what I want to do , " he said . " Because it helped me so much when I was growing up . " <p> 76ers ' Coach Is on the Spot <p> Midway through Allen Iverson 's rant after Philadelphia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder if Randy Ayers was going to be the next coach to be fired . Questioning the team 's toughness and heart , Iverson said the same players who battled like warriors for the previous six seasons had suddenly gone soft . <p> The only significant difference between this season and the past six ? Instead of Larry Brown , who led Philadelphia to the playoffs the past five years , the 76ers have Ayers on the sideline . <p> But when asked , Iverson stood up for Ayers , who gained a little breathing room when his 76ers ( 21-30 ) pasted the Lakers two days after Iverson 's outburst . <p> " That do n't have nothing to do with somebody playing tough , " Iverson said of the coaching change . " You 're talking about a Hall of Fame coach , so that says a lot about Coach Brown , but we have a lot of trust in Randy 's ability . " <p> Iverson added : " He gives an assignment and if it 's not getting done , what can he do ? If he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and does the same thing , what can he do ? A coach can only do but so much . " <p> That may be true , but Ayers had better find a way to keep the 76ers scrapping . <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com
