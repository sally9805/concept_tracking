Chapter One Our friend Kirby , it turned out , had charmed the owner of the Florida house , and the beer keg was fully operational , and so our last week of living like rich people unfolded amicably . I spent morbid , delicious amounts of time by myself , driven by the sort of hormonal instinct that I imagine leads cats to eat grass . The half-finished high-rises to our east were poised to engulf our idyll , even if we 'd wanted to come back another year , but the transformation of a quiet , sandpiper-friendly beach into a high-density population center was such a novelty for us that we did n't even have a category for the loss it represented . I studied the skeletal towers the way I studied bad weather . At the end of the week , my parents and I drove deeper into Florida , so that I could be taken to Disney World . My father was big on fairness , and because my brothers had once spent a day at Disneyland , many years earlier , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day at Disney World , whether or not I was too old for it , and whether or not I wanted to be there . I might not have minded going with my friend Manley , or with my not-girlfriend Hoener , and mocking and subverting the place and allowing myself to like it thatway . But mocking and subverting in the presence of my parents was out of the question . In our hotel room in Orlando , I begged my mother to let me wear my cutoff jeans and a T-shirt for the day , but my mother won the argument , and I arrived at Disney World in an ensemble of pleated shorts and a Bing Crosbyish sport shirt . Dressed like this , miserable with self-consciousness , I moved my feet only when I was directly ordered to . All I wanted to do was go sit in our car and read . In front of each themed ride , my mother asked me if it did n't look like lots of fun , but I saw the other teenagers waiting in line , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my throat ached , and I said the line was too long . My mother tried to cajole me , but my father cut her off : " Irene , he does n't want to ride this one . " We trudged on through diffuse , burning Florida sunshine to the next crowded ride . Where , again , the same story . " You have to ride something , " my father said finally , after we 'd had lunch . We were standing in the lee of an eatery while tawny-legged tourist girls thronged toward the water rides . My eyes fell on a nearby merry-go-round that was empty except for a few toddlers . " I 'll ride that , " I said in a dull voice . For the next twenty minutes , the three of us boarded and re-boarded the dismal merry-go-round , ensuring that our ride tickets were n't going to waste . I stared at the merry-go-round 's chevroned metal floor and radiated shame , mentally vomiting back the treat they 'd tried to give me . My mother , ever the dutiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our uncomfortably small horses , but beneath her forcible cheer she was angry at me , because she knew she was the one I was getting even with , because of our fight about clothes . My father , his fingers loosely grasping a horse-impaling metal pole , gazed into the distance with a look of resignation that summarized his life . I do n't see how either of them bore it . I 'd been their late , happy child , and now there was nothing I wanted more than to get away from them . My mother seemed to me hideously conformist and hopelessly obsessed with money and appearances ; my father seemed to me allergic to every kind of fun . I did n't want the things they wanted . I did n't value what they valued . And we were all equally sorry to be riding the merry-go-round , and we were all equally at a loss to explain what had happened to us .
