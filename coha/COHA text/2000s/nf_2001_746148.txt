In the modern United States , a substantial portion of our society has the view that this country is in a state of moral decay . The alleged causes of this decay take various forms but are often expressed as a belief that the nation has drifted away from its " sacred texts " - the Bible and the U.S. Constitution . The argument with both texts is that a literal reading provides moral guidance , while any other way of reading opens the door to the reader substituting her or his own subjective principles for what the text actually says . <p> For both biblical literalists and constitutional literalists , support for their world view comes from a belief that , since their very creation , these texts were read literally and a moral society was the result . Only in recent years ( often the 1960s are cited as the beginning of the fall ) have we begun to " interpret " them . The result , literalists would argue , is society 's moral decay . <p> In his 1985 article " Comparative Normative Hermeneutics : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Review 58 ) , scholar Ronald R. Garet summarizes the view this way : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Conservative religious leaders ( for example , Southern Baptists and various other evangelicals ) often blame moral decay on society 's increasing failure to read the Bible literally , and they attack " liberal " theologians who provide alternative explanations of what the Bible says . These attacks are often sharpest when it comes to particularly controversial issues like homosexuality but are reflected as well in debates over the role of women in the church and the use of corporal punishment . Biblical literalism argues that not only is the Bible literally correct on all moral questions but it provides historical truth as well . Jerry Falwell , a prominent biblical literalist , argues that " the Bible is the inerrant word of the living God . It is absolutely infallible , without error in all matters pertaining to faith and practice , as well as in areas such as geography , science , history , etc . " <p> Similarly , prominent conservative legal scholars-such as Robert Bork , Antonin Scalia , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less literally and that many of the problems of modern society are caused by " liberal " judges reading principles into the Constitution that are n't contained in its text . Judicial decisions on such topics as abortion , homosexuality , school prayer , and affirmative action are all seen as drastic departures from what the Constitution literally commands . As Bork states in Slouching Towards Gomorrah : Modern Liberalism and American Decline ( 1997 ) : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Because of this perceived threat , Bork has called for a constitutional amendment enabling a majority vote of Congress to override a U.S. Supreme Court decision . <p> In reality , however , debates over how to read the Bible and the Constitution have existed since the documents ' first creation . Arguments over literalism and interpretationism are nothing new and , in fact , reflect the enormous importance society places on these documents . To believe that the documents have always been read literally until recently simply ignores historical fact . BIBLICAl LITERALISM <p> One of the distinctive features of the three major monotheistic religions is their dependence on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> In her award-winning book A History of God ( 1993 ) , Karen Armstrong shows how the earliest religious creation stories were taken allegorically , not literally . As time passed , the methods of interpretation grew numerous , as the number of sects of religious belief multiplied . When one reads the great works of Augustine or Aquinas , it becomes clear that their work includes far more than mere literal interpretation of a text . In fact , The view that literalism was the only correct method of reading the Bible did n't achieve widespread acceptance until the sixteenth century . Armstrong says that : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> This new faith in a literal and absolutely correct scripture was the cause of the famous condemnation of Gallileo . His belief that the Earth circled around the sun violated the scriptures that " The world is firmly established ; it shall never be moved " ( Psalms 96:10 ) , and " The sun also ariseth , and the sun goeth down and hasteth to his place where he arose " ( Ecclesiastes 1:5 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a way that Islam and Judaism were not : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> The fact that theologians historically argued about the proper way to read the Bible is supported by other scholars . Garet asserts : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> It should also be noted that one of the major themes of the Protestant Reformation was a belief that the Bible should be interpreted literally , because this would enable lay readers to free themselves from papal rule and lead to a truer , personal understanding of God 's will . This doctrine was called sola scriptura and in principle , although less in practice , was an attack on the role of reason . As Garet points out , " Far from being natural or self-evident theologically , it emerged quite late and then only as a result of a specific complex of theological motivations . " <p> Apart from its historical origins , we can examine the practical effects of reading the Bible literally . In short , it can create just as many conflicts as does reading it liberally , in bis 1996 article " Beyond Biblical Literalism and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( Sociology of Religion 57 ) , John Bartkowski shows how literalists often disagree amongst themselves as to what the Bible commands . For example , on the issue of whether wives should submit to their husbands , Bartkowski examines the writings of two self-proclaimed biblical literalists : The Christian Family ( 1970 ) by Larry Christensen and Being a Woman of God 1993 ) by Ginger Gabriel . Although both Christensen and Gabriel provide support with scriptural quotations for their view , they achieve almost the exact opposite conclusion . Christensen believes that women are weaker than men and inherently more prone to sinful behavior and , thus , must submit themselves to their husbands . Gabriel , on the other hand , believes that men and women are equal and that the Bible calls for mutual submission between husband and wife . <p> Bartkowski finds a similar dispute on the value of corporal punishment between biblical literalists James Dobson in Date to Discipline ( 1970 ) and Russ Campbell in How to Really Love Your Child ( 1990 ) . Bartowksi concludes that " from a hermeneutic perspective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiple readings-even multiple literal ' readings-and can yield seemingly contradictory conclusions . " Similar conflicts between literalists were found in historical debates over slavery , temperance movements , and pacifism . ( Beyond conflicting interpretations of the same language , there are additional problems in deciding which texts constitute part of the canon and in resolving translation differences ; similar debates occur today over the role of cases and contemporary writings in constitutional literalism . ) <p> As Shakespeare wrote , " Even the devil can cite scripture for his purpose . " The problem with biblical literalism , then , is clear : once each side has found biblical support for its cause , the debate can not be resolved . The only rational way to satisfactorily conclude such a debate is to interpret the principles contained behind the literal passages , and this deviates from the command of literalism itself . <p> This debate over the proper way to read scripture is an important one . Those who believe in the text 's divine origin look to it for guidance in almost every aspect of their lives . Furthermore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't believe . Although ( or perhaps because ) the debate is important , it is enduring . It has taken place for centuries , and whatever ills may plague us today can not be fairly attributed to the fact that there are advocates of each position . CONSTITUTIONAL LITERALISM <p> Constitutional literalism takes two distinct threads . A view held by only a very small minority of scholars is epitomized by Justice Owen Roberts ' notorious view in United States v. Butler ( 1936 ) : " The judicial branch of the government has only one duty ; to lay the article of the Constitution which is invoked beside the statute which is challenged and to decide whether the latter squares with the former . " Even conservative scholars rarely take this position because the flaw is obvious : the Constitution speaks in " majestic generalities , " using vague and potentially limitless terms such as guaranteeing due process and allowing only reasonable searches . Such scholars instead turn to a method of interpretation called originalism or strict constructionism . H. Jefferson Powell summarizes the view well in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Harvard Law Review 98 ) : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> It is well known that the 1960s and early 1970s were a controversial time in the Supreme Court 's history . The Warren Court issued Griswold ( legalizing contraceptives ) in 1965 , Miranda ( requiring that arrestees be informed of their rights before being interrogated ) in 1966 , and , of course , Roe v. Wade ( legalizing abortion ) in 1973 . Decisions such as these placed the Supreme Court in the spotlight and made it a prime target for criticism by conservative commentators . The originalist movement was a response to this perceived " judicial tyranny . " <p> Although , as Edward P. Lazurus points out in Closed Chambers ( 1998 ) , it is " far from obvious why the Constitution , replete with clauses of indefinite content , designed with the evident purpose to apply to unseen and unforeseeable changes in the structure of American society , should be interpreted exclusively by reference to the vision of persons dead for more than 200 years , " many conservative scholars argue that we should look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find out what they intended the language of the Constitution to mean . There are several practical problems with this view , most damning of which is the fact that the framers themselves did n't believe that their intent should govern future interpretation of the document . Far from being a new phenomena , debates over the proper way of reading the Constitution surrounded the very ratification process itself . As Powell points out in his Harvard Law Review article , " Once the Constitution was proposed to the states , a central element of the campaign to prevent ratification was the charge that the Constitution would be the object of interpretation and that judges and legislators would read into it doctrines present only constructively ' and not textually . " In response , the Federalists argued , according to Theophilus Parsons at the Massachusetts convention , that " no compositions which men can pen , could be formed , but which would be liable to the same charge of ambiguity . " <p> Central to the debates was whether the Constitution should be interpreted solely with reference to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at statutes . Much as our modern-day Republican and Democratic parties define themselves by reference to " strict constructionism " as opposed to " living , breathing constitutionalism , " parties at the time of the ratification process defined themselves by reference to how they believed the Constitution should be interpreted . As Powell puts it : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> If we look at what the framers themselves actually intended , it seems doubtful they expected future generations to pay great attention to their subjective intent . The framers took no official records of their meetings , and James Madison , who privately kept notes of the Constitutional Convention , expressly allowed them to be published only at his death , writing that " as a guide in expounding and applying the provisions of the Constitution , the debates and incidental decisions of the Convention can have no authoritative character . " <p> Conservatives often criticize the Warren Court as the inventor of liberal construction and argue that originalism would stop such problems from happening again . But the first Supreme Court refused to embrace originalism . In 1793 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sued in federal court . Despite the " virtually unanimous " writings of the framers that the states retained their sovereign immunity , the Court applied the " ordinary rules for construction " and found otherwise in Chisholm v. Georgia . <p> Courts and legal scholars since then have routinely argued that making law solely with reference to the intent of the framers would be unwise . In 1910 the Court said in Weems v. United States that " a principle , to be vital , must be capable of wider application than the mischief which gave it birth . " in 1920 , Oliver Wendell Holmes said in Missouri v. Holland that PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> And in 1921 , Benjamin Cardozo said in The Nature of the Judicial Process : " The great generalities of the Constitution have a content and a significance that vary from age to age . " <p> In a practical sense , the results of using original intent are shocking . As Steven B. Epstein points out in " Rethinking the Constitutionality of Ceremonial Deism " ( Columbia Law Review 96 ) , ir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the framers intended , " African-Americans would still be subjected to Jim Crow laws , segregated schools , and miscegenation statutes ; women would not be entitled to the protection of the Equal Protection Clause and seditious libel could still be a crime . " <p> Of course , the fact that historically there have been several ways of looking at the Constitution does n't mean that original intent is an invalid way of reading it . But it does mean that supporters ca n't claim historical warrant for it . In short , the " original intent " was that the intent of the framers should n't matter . Additionally , any claims that interpreting the Constitution is a new phenomenon promulgated by activist liberal judges are also doomed to fall in the light of historical evidence . <p> There are several interesting similarities between biblical literalism and Constitutional literalism that deserve to be explored further in another setting . For example , both kinds of literalists usually believe that their text is necessary for civilization , that they are dealing with unique documents , that writers of these documents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their text can provide all of the answers . Additionally , both biblical and constitutional literalists believe that any " problems " are with the interpretation of the document , not the document itself . Both are conservative reactions to liberal advances in society ; the ebb and flow of literalist movements is often akin to a cultural pendulum . Finally , both kinds of literalism evince a fear of the use of reason and an assault on intellectualism . <p> There are also , of course , fascinating differences between the two kinds of literalism . Constitutional interpretation is a vital question , because it directly affects all citizens , while there is a large and growing segment of our society that does n't believe in biblical authority at all . Differences also lie in who has the ultimate authority to pronounce what the language means , which tertiary texts are considered canonical , and the effects of an inconsistency on the ultimate authority of the document . Finally , it 's important that we understand that biblical literalism and constitutional literalism are n't two separate phenomena . Biblical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , constitutional literalism . <p> Arguments over how to read our " sacred texts " are n't new and they are n't the invention of activist judges or liberal theologians . These arguments existed when the documents were first created , throughout their long history , and are likely to continue well into the future . The fact that we work so hard to find out the best way to read a text is evidence of its importance in our lives . For both the Bible and the Constitution , the documents are important only if we are capable of adapting them to changes in society . We should n't pretend they could have meaning otherwise . <p> " Both read the Bible day and night , , But thou read'st black where I read white .
