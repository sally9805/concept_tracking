Section : WORLDVIEW <p> ALTHOUGH SUICIDE bombings , military strikes , and other forms of violence are likely to continue spasmodically into the foreseeable future , there is good news out of the Middle East Israel and the Palestinians are resuming their efforts to achieve peace . The rise of Mahmoud Abbas , a moderate , to the , newly-created position of Palestinian Prime Minister , Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon 's apparent willingness to reach a diplomatic arrangement , and the Bush Administration 's renewed interest in resolving the conflict provide hope that an end to years of senseless violence in the region is near The bad news is that the " road map , " the plan put forward by the U.S. , United Nations , European Union , and Russia ( the " Quartet " ) to overcome differences between Israelis and Palestinians , probably will not work . The problem is that the road map erroneously assumes that political confidence can be established gradually , starting with relatively easy to resolve issues and working up to the most difficult ones . <p> Deep suspicions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace exacerbate disputes between Israelis and Palestinians over issues such as the status of Jerusalem and the right of return for Palestinian refugees . Should Israel share control over Jerusalem with the Palestinians ? Will Palestinian refugees be permitted to come back to Israel and settle ? Many Israelis believe that Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat 's rejection of the peace proposal presented to , him in July , 2000 , at Camp David as well as the subsequent uprising ( Intifada ) in the occupied territories prove that the Palestinians ' true motive is the destruction of Israel . Many Palestinians believe that Israel 's occupation and settlement of the West Bank and Gaza Strip is evidence of its desire to control these territories permanently . <p> The road map is a performance-based plan designed to overcome Israeli and Palestinian fears gradually . In phase one , it 's specified that the Palestinian Authority must , among other things , " immediately undertake an unconditional cessation of violence , " draft a constitution based on " strong parliamentary democracy , " and issue an unambiguous statement regarding Israel 's right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its forces from Palestinian lands occupied after Sept. 28 , 2000 , dismantle settlements erected since March , 201 , and take measures to improve the humanitarian condition in the occupied territories . <p> Phase two of the plan focuses on developing a democratic Palestinian state with provisional borders . During this stage , the road map envisions preliminary negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians over a Palestinian state under the auspices of an international conference brokered by the Quartet . In the third and final phase , Israelis and Palestinians are scheduled to tackle the politically explosive issues of final borders , settlements , refugees , and Jerusalem in an effort to resolve their long-standing conflict . <p> The road map is structured so that the parties face increasingly difficult issues as they move from phase one to phase three ; progress from one stage of the plan to the next depends on the completion of prior steps . The road map deliberately attempts to replace each sides fears about getting double-crossed with mounting assurances that propel the disputants toward a resolution of the most contentious issues in their relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israel and the Palestinians can convince each other of their trustworthiness through a series of progressively more stringent tests . Problematic is the fact that the road map does not require the parties to sacrifice enough when the stakes are relatively low to generate the confidence they need to take difficult steps as the stakes increase . For example , it is clear that the question of sovereignty over the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif area in the old city of Jerusalem is one of the most sensitive in the Israeli-Palestinian relationship . In fact the insolubility of this issue is largely responsible for the failure of the 2000 Camp David talks where Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak broke taboos by showing a willingness to share control over Jerusalem with the Palestinians . <p> The breakdown during the Oslo peace process is instructive here as well . From the Israeli perspective , even though the Palestinians implemented a number of measures specified in the 1993 Declaration of Principles , extremist violence perpetrated by groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad ultimately convinced them that they could not rely on the Palestinian Authority to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlement of the West Bank carved up Palestinian communities into noncontiguous " Bantustans "  --  la South Africa  --  and persuaded them that Israel was uninterested in the development of a viable Palestinian state . <p> The Oslo experience also points to another weakness inherent in the road map . By definition , peace plans designed to reconcile parties gradually take time to implement . The road map , for example , does not envision an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict until at least 2005 . However , time is often the enemy of peace in that the longer it takes to resolve a conflict , the more opportunities there are for opponents and unforeseen events to derail the process . In 1993 , for instance , a scandal involving the leader of the Israeli Shas party , Aryeh Deri , nearly brought down Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin 's labor coalition government and prevented the signing of the first Oslo accord . At the time , Labor held a slim majority in the Israeli parliament and a center-right Likud government surely would have maintained its opposition to peace with the Palestinian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to deal with Israeli and Palestinian security concerns with steps that effectively make security for both parties a nonissue . Israelis and Palestinians see the conflict in existential terms . In other words , Israelis and Palestinians fear that getting exploited by the other will lead to their domination or destruction . This infects Middle East relations , making even relatively simple agreements between them difficult to achieve and trust a near impossibility . By providing one another security guarantees from the outset , Israel and the Palestinians will find it much easier to resolve their conflict . <p> Typically , references to security measures conjure up images associated with military defense : armed soldiers guarding borders , lookout towers , aerial reconnaissance , etc . This is no different for the Middle East , where protection against armed attacks must be a part of any joint peace agreement . Introducing an international peacekeeping force to separate the sides has worked for Israel and Egypt and Israel and Syria , and thus should ease Israeli concerns about being overrun . Peacekeepers also would have the meritorious effect of undermining the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Gaza Strip , making it easier for them to withdraw and allow for a Palestinian state . However , providing the security necessary for trusting relationships to emerge requires more than border defense . It means that Israel and the Palestinians must address two security dimensions  --  security from political domination and " electoral " security  --  that have been conspicuous in their absence from previous Middle East peace plans . <p> Palestinians in particular fear that cooperation with Israel will substitute Israeli military domination with Israeli political domination . Israel can allay Palestinian fears by agreeing to create a joint decisionmaking body , made up of Israeli and Palestinian representatives , that ensures both parties the ability to influence decisions affecting issues of concern . In short , Israel can resolve that they will not dominate the Palestinians by giving them the ability to participate in and influence issues important to both sides . There is historical precedent for this approach . For example , the creation of the U.S. Senate during the Constitutional Convention in 1787 reassured small population states , like Delaware , that large population states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the new Federal system . To be secure , both Israelis and Palestinians need assurances that their " voice " will be heard by one another as issues in their relationship emerge after a peace settlement . <p> Moreover , any agreement between Israel and the Palestinians must provide each side 's leadership with mechanisms to protect themselves against those that might oppose the deal at home . Israeli and Palestinian leaders either will not accept a peace that threatens their tenure in office or will not abide by its conditions . This is true whether Palestinians successfully implement the democratic reforms spelled out in the road map or not ; all leaders ( even dictators ) require the support of at least some of their citizens . For instance , during the Oslo peace process , Arafat frequently dealt gingerly with those responsible for terror attacks against Israel because of his concern that aggressive treatment would alienate the Palestinian masses and lead to his downfall . Although providing electoral stability may be the most difficult barrier to overcome , it may be possible to insulate Israeli and Palestinian leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy off opponents of peace . For example , a generous financial settlement for Palestinian refugees displaced from their homes by Israeli commanders during the 1948 war may help quell their hostility to an agreement . <p> The road map is an ambitious plan for peace in the Middle East . Its call for a Palestinian state departs from previous plans in that it specifies what the resolution of the conflict will look like , thus providing an additional source of hope and legitimacy to Palestinian aspirations . Where the road map is weak is in its assumption that , in the words of former National Security advisor Zbigniew Brzeinski and his colleagues Franois Duchne and Kiichi Saeki , " political confidence can be sliced up into neat parcels like territory . " As long as Israelis and Palestinians fear that cooperating with one another places their physical survival , political independence , and/or tenure in office at risk , efforts at confidence-building are not going to succeed . Only when both parties are certain that their very existence is not at issue can the peace process produce its desired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld ( left ) escorts Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon into the Pentagon where the two were to discuss Middle Eastern security issues . <p> By Aaron Hoffman <p> <p> Aaron Hoffman is a professor of political science at Purdue University , West Lafayette , Ind . <p>
