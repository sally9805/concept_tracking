PRODUCT Flowery fashions HOW IT STARTED Designers decided blooming dresses might lift spirits JUDGMENT May wilt by summer <P> This spring 's fashions come straight from the garden : flowers are in bloom everywhere , on flowing skirts , flouncy dresses and stretch jeans . From silk to leather , no material is left uncultivated . What 's behind the desire to turn women into walking bouquets ? Escapism . In an uncertain world , the bursting buds are designed to lift spirits with a sense of renewal . " Now more than ever , soft , feminine colors and beauty are what 's important , " says Jaqui Lividini , a fashion executive at Saks Fifth Avenue . High-end houses like Dior offer skintight jeans with a flower beaded design for $3,000 . In more down-to-earth offerings , Betsy Johnson has a lace-trimmed hot pink hydrangea-print dress ( $296 ) , and Banana Republic has a silk skirt with a print of mini-dahlias ( $88 ) . <P>  --  By Janice M.
