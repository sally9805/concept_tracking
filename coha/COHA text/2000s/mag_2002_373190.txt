President Bush does n't think corporate America needs a pile of new regulations . Someone just needs to tell business leaders to cut out the shenanigans . Bush did exactly that last week with some tough words . But his words were far more ambiguous when he had to explain alleged shenanigans of his own . Dick Cheney offered no answers to similar questions . That undercut Bush 's moral authority , and the stock market just kept dropping .  --  By Mitch Frank <P> WHAT BUSH SUPPORTS " I urge board members to check the quality of their company 's financial statements , to ask tough questions about accounting methods , " Bush told corporate leaders during a speech last week , saying CEOs will be held accountable . <P> WHAT BUSH AND CHENEY DID While BUSH was on Harken Energy 's board of directors and a member of its audit committee , the company hid losses by selling a subsidiary to itself . Harken officers bought Aloha Petroleum with a loan from the company . Harken labeled the sale a $7.9 million profit , shrinking its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SEC forced the company to restate its losses to $12.6 million . <P> THE EXPLANATION Bush 's words to reporters last week : " All I can tell you is that in the corporate world , sometimes things are n't exactly black and white when it comes to accounting procedures . " <P> WHAT BUSH SUPPORTS " I challenge compensation committees to put an end to all company loans to corporate officers . " Bush says the loans have been abused . He also calls on CEOs to clearly justify how much they are paid in salary , bonuses and benefits . <P> WHAT BUSH AND CHENEY DID Twice , in 1986 and 1988 , Harken loaned BUSH money at low interest to buy company stock . The loans totaled $180,375 . The company later sweetened the terms of the loans , freeing up some of Bush 's stock that was being used as collateral . Bush sold those shares and used the proceeds  --  $848,000  --  to help finance his purchase of part of the Texas Rangers baseball team . <P> THE EXPLANATION The White House says there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common practice , and gross abuses like WorldCom 's $400 million insider loan to CEO Bernard Ebbers . <P> WHAT BUSH SUPPORTS " We 're moving corporate accounting out of the shadows , so the investing public will have a true and fair and timely picture of assets and liabilities and income of publicly traded companies . Greater transparency will expose bad companies . " <P> WHAT BUSH AND CHENEY DID While CHENEY was Halliburton 's CEO , the company 's construction contracts allowed it to negotiate for additional payment if cost overruns hurt profits . In 1998 , the company began listing those disputed claims as revenue , even when clients had not yet agreed to pay . Two months ago , Halliburton disclosed that the SEC was investigating the aggressive accounting . <P> THE EXPLANATION Cheney 's not talking . But a White House spokesman said the lawsuit against Halliburton , Cheney and Arthur Andersen on behalf of shareholders was " without merit . "
