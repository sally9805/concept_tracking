<p> USA TODAY hockey reporter Kevin Allen , covering his fifth Winter Olympics , makes his predictions for the men 's tournament . Countries are listed in order of projected finish : <p> Canada <p> History : The Canadians won the Olympics in 2002 . They won the world championships in 2003 and 2004 . They won the World Cup in 2004 . Last spring they finished second in the world championships . Canada also is the two-time defending world junior champion . <p> Goaltending : Marty Brodeur ( New Jersey Devils ) was No.1 in 2002 when Canada won gold and in 2004 in the World Cup . He 's now in Italy , where his father , Denis , played goal for Canada 's bronze medal team in 1956 . <p> Woes : Defensemen Scott Niedermayer and Ed Jovanovski are out with injuries , and Rob Blake , Chris Pronger and Bryan McCabe are playing hurt . A betting scandal involving Phoenix Coyotes associate coach Rick Tocchet has a cloud over Team Canada executive director Wayne Gretzky , Tocchet 's boss . <p> Story line : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a medal in these Games . The country 's pool is strong enough to replace the key injuries experienced in recent weeks . It was n't long ago there was sentiment across Canada that it was losing its edge as a producer of hockey talent . Today no one questions that Canada is the world 's greatest hockey power . This roster has a collection of veterans and rising young stars . Rick Nash ( Columbus Blue Jackets ) is 21 , and last spring he was the most dominant player in the world championships . Joe Thornton ( San Jose Sharks ) is here at 26 , as is Joe Sakic at 36 . <p> Possibilities : Canada won the gold in 2002 , and this is a more skilled , faster team . <p> Czech Republic <p> History : The Czechs ' Olympic history dates to the sport 's origin in 1920 . In 1998 the Czechs won the gold medal when the NHL first sent its players . <p> Goaltending : The expectation is that Dominik Hasek ( Ottawa Senators ) and Tomas Vokoun ( Nashville Predators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular athletes in the country 's history , and Vokoun helped win the world championships last year . <p> Woes : Petr Prucha ( New York Rangers ) is out because of a knee injury . <p> Story line : Good karma abounds . The Czechs won the world championships last spring , and Jaromir Jagr seems to be re-energized . This team is overflowing with talent . When Prucha went down , the team replaced him with Patrik Elias ( New Jersey ) . Highly skilled Elias , who has recovered from hepatitis , has the potential to be one of the top scorers in the tournament . This team skates swiftly and handles the puck sweetly . <p> Possibilities : The Czechs remember the wild celebration in Prague after the 1998 gold . They could relive that moment . <p> Sweden <p> History : Sweden won the gold medal on Peter Forsberg 's shootout in 1994 , and the Swedes have won a medal in four of the last seven Olympics . However , they have not won a medal since 1994 . <p> Goaltending : Henrik Lundqvist ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain of Tommy Salo 's 2002 gaffe against Belarus . He might be the country 's best goalie since Pelle Lindbergh . <p> Woes : Forsberg ( Philadelphia Flyers ) has a groin injury , but he desperately wants to play , even though he might not be able to right away . That should tell you something about Sweden 's chances . Markus Naslund ( Vancouver Canucks ) decided not to play . <p> Story line : The Swedes have three defensemen who are No.1 on their team  --  Nick Lidstrom ( Detroit Red Wings ) , Mattias Ohlund ( Vancouver ) and Mattias Norstrom ( Los Angeles Kings ) . They have premium forwards in Ottawa 's Daniel Alfredsson , who is playing perhaps the best hockey of his career , and Henrik Zetterberg ( Detroit ) , who has emerged a true NHL star . Mats Sundin ( Toronto Maple Leafs ) is also a catalyst in their puck possession game , and the Swedes are traditionally a solid defensive team . <p> Possibilities : This team could make Swedish fans forget about the Belarus debacle at Salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swedes believe they can win in Torino . <p> Russia <p> History : Since 1956 , the Russians or Soviets have won a hockey medal in 12 of the 13 Olympics . <p> Goaltending : In 2005 , Evgeni Nabokov ( San Jose ) became eligible to compete for Russia . He had competed for Kazakhstan as a teen . <p> Woes : Goaltender Nikolai Khabibulin ( Chicago Blackhawks ) is out with a sprained knee . Sergei Fedorov ( Columbus ) and Alexander Mogilny ( New Jersey ) opted out . <p> Story line : Former NHL player Pavel Bure was brought to help ease the tensions between the old guard in the Russian Ice Hockey Federation and the new generation of players . The Russian roster is impressive , with dynamic players such as Alexander Ovechkin ( Washington Capitals ) , Pavel Datsyuk ( Detroit ) , Ilya Kovalchuk ( Atlanta Thrashers ) and Alexei Kovalev ( Montreal Canadiens ) . This team will move the puck with Internet speed . <p> Possibilities : No one is talking about the Russians , and they should be . Would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gold ? <p> USA <p> History : The Americans won the silver medal in 2002 under coach Herb Brooks , their first medal since Brooks guided the team to a gold medal in 1980 . <p> Goaltending : John Grahame ( Tampa Bay Lightning ) will start at least the first game , with Rick DiPietro ( New York Islanders ) as his backup . <p> Woes : Based on performance , Buffalo Sabres rookie Ryan Miller has been the USA 's best goalie this season . When the team was named in December , he was left off because he was coming off an injury . The Americans also do n't have many of the league 's top scorers . <p> Story line : Captain Chris Chelios ( Detroit ) is probably correct when he says a good start is crucial . When the team stumbled out of the gate in Nagano in 1998 , the result was awful . When the Americans played crisply and sharply in Salt Lake , they ended up with a silver medal . The team is being cast as the over-the-hill gang because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very talented team . Most NHL teams would be quite happy with its collection of centers : Mike Modano ( Dallas ) , Doug Weight ( Carolina Hurricanes ) , Craig Conroy ( Los Angeles ) and Scott Gomez ( New Jersey ) . <p> Possibilities : A medal is a possibility more than a likelihood . The key for the Americans is to get a strong goaltending performance in the quarterfinal . It 's not unthinkable that DiPietro could be No.1 by tournament 's end . Since he was drafted , he has been cast as the next great U.S. goalie . <p> Slovakia <p> History : They have qualified for four consecutive Olympics , with a best finish of sixth in 1994 . <p> Goaltending : Peter Budaj is 7-5-4 for the Colorado Avalanche this season . Jan Lasak has international experience . <p> Woes : Still not quite enough depth on defense , and goaltending , while improved , is n't Brodeur or Hasek quality . Skilled forward Ladislav Nagy ( Phoenix ) is out . <p> Story line : The Slovaks are seeded third because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the first Olympics in which they have had all their skilled players together for the Games . Zdeno Chara ( Ottawa ) could be the biggest difference-maker among defensemen , and not because he 's 6-9 . This is a team of puck wizards , with Pavol Demitra ( Los Angeles ) , Marian Hossa ( Atlanta ) , Marian Gaborik ( Minnesota Wild ) and Marek Svatos ( Colorado ) up front and Lubomir Visnovsky ( Los Angeles ) on defense . He leads NHL defensemen with 56 points in 58 games . <p> Possibilities : It 's chic to pick the talented Slovaks to win a bronze . <p> Finland <p> History : After going 74 years without an Olympic hockey medal , Finland won back-to-back bronze medals in 1994 and 1998 . <p> Goaltending : Antero Niittymaki ( Philadelphia ) earns the No.1 job by default . <p> Woes : Goalkeeping was supposed to be Finland 's advantage in these Games , and then the Calgary Flames ' Miikka Kiprusoff and Atlanta 's Kari Lehtonen decided not to play to give nagging injuries time to heal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Story line : The plucky Finns have been solid to highly competitive performers on the world stage in recent years , but defections leave the team with the look of a middle-of-the-pack team . The Finns can put together a nice power play with the rejuvenated Teemu Selanne ( Anaheim Mighty Ducks ) , plus Saku Koivu ( Montreal ) and Jere Lehtinen ( Dallas Stars ) , up front , and Kimmo Timonen ( Nashville ) on the point . The team leader is former NHL great Jari Kurri . <p> Possibilities : The Finns have to talk about what could have been , rather than what is . <p> Switzerland <p> History : The Swiss are in their 14th Olympic hockey tournament . They have no medals since 1948 . <p> Goaltending : Presumably Martin Gerber ( Carolina ) has moved ahead of David Aebeischer ( Colorado ) on the team 's depth chart . Gerber has been impressive for the first-place Hurricanes this season . <p> Woes : Can you name one Swiss player other than the goalies ? That 's their undoing . <p> Story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cup championship team , getting 13 points in 17 playoff games . He 's playing in the Swiss League . <p> Possibilities : If the goaltending is good , the Swiss could reach the quarterfinals . It will come down to the Swiss or Germans for the fourth spot in their pool . <p> Latvia <p> History : In 2002 , Latvia made its first Olympic hockey appearance in 66 years and finished ninth . <p> Goaltending : Former NHL goaltender Arturs Irbe is the biggest name on the team . <p> Woes : With only three NHL players on the roster , this roster is thin . Irbe is playing in Austria , and his best goaltending days are presumably behind him . <p> Story line : The Latvians received some help when it was announced Anaheim defenseman Sandis Ozolinsh was able to leave his substance abuse program to play in the Games . <p> Possibilities : The Latvians are hosting the world championships , and they will have a better chance to make a splash there with their fans behind them . <p> Kazakhstan <p> History : Kazakhstan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighth with a 1-4-2 record . <p> Goaltending : Vitaly Kolesnik has played seven games for Colorado this season . <p> Woes : Nikolai Antropov ( Toronto ) is the team 's only NHL player . <p> Story line : Kazakhstan has enough Russian League veterans to be taken seriously . Everyone remembers what happened to Sweden in 2002 when it allowed Belarus players to smell an upset . <p> Possibilities : Kazakhstan is in a pool with USA , Sweden , Russia and Slovakia . It wo n't get out alive . <p> Germany <p> History : The Germans are making their 18th Olympic hockey appearance , and they have one medal  --  a bronze in 1976 . <p> Goaltending : Olie Kolzig ( Washington ) was born in South Africa of German parents and was raised in Canada . <p> Woes : The Germans had only seven NHL players , and two of them ( Marco Sturm and Jochen Hecht ) pulled out because of injuries . <p> Story line : The Germans are coached by former NHL player Uwe Krupp . But their lack of NHL players is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is improved , they are still plow horses against Thoroughbreds in this field . <p> Italy <p> History : The Italians are making their first Olympic appearance since 1998 . Their best finish was seventh in 1956 . <p> Goaltending : Former NHLer Jason Muzzatti , 35 , played for the Rangers , Calgary and Hartford , along with Gunther Hell , 26 . <p> Woes : There are no Italians in the NHL , and Italy 's professional hockey league does n't measure up to the premium leagues in Europe . <p> Story line : The Italians have nine Canadians , including a few with minimal NHL experience . These Canadians , with Italian heritage , give the roster added credibility , but it is still like a minor league team . <p> Possibilities : Some Canadians will go to the medal stand , but it wo n't be the Italian-Canadians . Hockey pool groups <p> The top four from each group advance to the quarterfinals . <p> Group A <p> Canada <p> Czech Republic <p> Finland <p> Germany <p> Switzerland <p> Italy <p> Group B <p> Sweden <p> Slovakia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Bob Laird , USA TODAY , Source : International Ice Hockey Federation ( Diagrams ) PHOTO , B/W , Paul Vernon , AP PHOTO , B/W , Mike Blake , Reuters
