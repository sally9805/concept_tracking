I AM IN THE KMART across the street from the hospital , holding the blue sweater in one hand and the green sweater in the other , checking out the prices as my mother sleeps in the Intensive Care Unit , letting a ventilator breathe for her . <p> " May I help you ? " <p> I lower the blue sweater , then the green . Behind the sweater stands a white-haired saleslady , Jan , her Welcome to Kmart tag reads . <p> " I 'm cold , Jan . I ca n't take it anymore . " <p> " Well , honey , it is Florida , " she says . She straightens some sweaters falling off their hangers . " But it 's also January . " <p> " I know where I am , " I say . " I know what month it is . " <p> Jan takes the green sweater from me and holds it up to my chin . " Oh , now , does n't that bring out your blond highlights ? " <p> In the coming months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good neighbor visits another , dropping in for one thing and going back later , even the same day , for something else , I 'll always smile at Jan and say hello . She 'll be polite , but wo n't remember that I 'm the lady who dropped the blue sweater and walked away from her without a word . <p> As I make my way to the checkout stand , empty-handed , I yank the first sweater that catches my eye off the men 's rack . It is gray . It has deep pockets . It is " Extra Large . " It is n't on sale , and it 'll be years later before I acknowledge the resemblance it has to the sweater my father wore when he was alive . <p> At the hospital I 'm able to get my same parking space , and I check to see if Sydney 's car is still around . She has left the top down on her convertible . I get out of my car , debating whether my cousin was in a rush to see Allie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I am walking through the parking lot , trying to yank the tag free from my sweater , as Allie sleeps with tape wrapped over her upper lip , around the back of her head to hold the breathing tube in her mouth . I wave off the man in the golf cart whose job it is to bring people to the entrance . I 'm relatively young and healthy-I can make it to the entrance myself , I 'm thinking until I see the red hatchback with the words Pray for My Family 's Loss written in white letters on the back window . The sweater tag breaks loose , and I fumble my arms into the sleeves . The golf-cart man is on the other side of the parking lot , and no one else is around . I have to steady myself and march up to Allie 's room . <p> I pass the waiting room , spotting Sydney , newspaper resting in her lap . I 'm ready to ream her for leaving Allie 's room , when I see her talking to the same man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I walked in to call the front desk about seeing Allie . I had n't even really seen him until I turned around , trying to untangle myself from the phone cord as the nurse on the other end said I could come into the ICU . Then I spotted the man and jumped , smacking the wall . He smiled . I hung up the phone , and the man raised a Styrofoam cup to me . <p> " I have an extra coffee , " he had said . " You probably have n't even had time to wake up . " <p> Throughout Allie 's hospital stay , decline , recovery , discharge , decline , and passing , I would walk away from Virgil many times . This time would be the first . Walking away from Virgil became a habit , but he insisted he had a power people could not deny . Ivey , Virgil would say , I speak to God ; I could show you how comforting it is . Virgil , I say , I listen to spirits ; they tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing ? <p> I received my power from my aunt , Bones ; she was good enough to have her own gig . All she did was take the person 's hand , pray for guidance and wisdom , sit the person down , turn on a tape recorder , and repeat whatever the spirit who showed up said . People who have crossed over are more than willing to talk , Bones would say . It 's just nobody wants to hear them . Spirit guides us all the time , Ivey-take that with you-but real listening is like knife throwing : It takes technique . <p> I 've never told anyone that I 'm not as good as Bones yet . In fact , Bones is the only spirit I 've heard so far . She told me to go back to Florida ; I was needed . <p> Virgil says it 's God talking to me , that I have a special duty if I can hear Him . But Bones told me before she died that she had chosen me-not Allie , her own sister , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the thing with gifts , I tell Virgil , you can use them or not . But it did n't take intuition to know Bones would be disappointed in me for not using the gift . She always said God 's gifts were never given for free . <p> It 's the God angle that Virgil is working on Sydney as he sits with his back to the waiting-room entrance , hands in his lap , pitching the line about comfort in faith . I stand outside the waiting room waving for Sydney to come to me as she sits inside it waving for me to come to her . Stevie , the waiting-room regular , sits against the wall , twisting his head from side to side , watching us rather than the TV . <p> " Get in here , Ivey , " Sydney finally says . <p> Virgil snaps his head back to look at me , and everyone else in the waiting room follows suit . I do n't acknowledge any of their stares . I wrap my sweater arms around myself and make my entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk show . <p> I stand in front of my cousin , waiting to be reprimanded as if we are girls again , playing some invented game in which I have broken the rules . We were only children and lived close enough that it was hard not to see each other . But as we grew , we each found more comfort in the other one 's mother , me always going to Bones for understanding , Sydney always going to Allie to talk about boys . Allie got to see Sydney become the daughter she always wanted , one who is married , kids , job , the whole package ; Sydney exercises regularly , does field trips , laundry , and even cooks meals . <p> But I was the one who was told that Allie needed care , so I came back to live with her . I was the one who was told her cough was n't going away . I was the one who was told to take over the diner Allie owned . I was the one who was told that Allie had fears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would all be OK . And I was the one who was told there would be a call in the middle of the night . What I was n't told was that last night Nurse Kristy would call at two-thirty in the morning to say Allie had been put on a ventilator because she had stopped breathing . <p> " You were supposed to be gone for an hour , " Sydney says . " It 's been thirteen minutes . " <p> I raise my sweater arms . " I bought this . " <p> " Why ? " Sydney says , and recrosses her legs . <p> " I 'm cold , " I say . <p> Sydney and I will never break down in front of each other during Allie 's illness . By busying herself with tracking down doctors , pestering nurses , reviewing Allie 's medical insurance , getting a VCR in her room so Allie can watch her soap operas , Sydney will stop herself from thinking how she has already lost her own mother and will now lose the only person who ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sydney to arrive the evening she decides to pass away in her own bed , and I will hold my cousin for a few moments when she walks into Allie 's bedroom and sees Allie still and white . Afterwards , everyone will say how the cousins really pulled together , what good care they took of Allie , how they 've always acted like sisters . They never fell apart , people will comment , and it 's this truth that will divide us . <p> " It 's a nice sweater , " Virgil says . <p> I turn so fast my sweater sleeves swing . Instead of Virgil , I notice all the Monday faces in the room . Me and the black men , Stevie and his brother Eli in the corner , are the regulars . We all started out like the old couple next to me-coats still on , sitting straight , smiling at people passing , jumping when the phone rings . Waiting-room rules are self-realized . Instead of looking at the dated magazines , soon the old couple will bring their own reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and game shows . They 'll follow a soap opera . They 'll have a regular seat and know to change the TV channel when the news comes on . The one thing they 'll lose interest in is the news . <p> " Virgil is from Allie 's church , " Sydney says . " He 's Father Nelson 's replacement . " She 's folding a newspaper in sections . When the paper wo n't bend any longer , she unfolds it and starts over without taking out any sections or even looking at the front-page headlines . Sydney is n't aware of what 's in her hands . <p> " I try to keep up to date . I did n't even know Father Nelson had passed , " Sydney continues . She turns to Virgil to ensure an audience . " Allie always said Father Nelson would perform her funeral . " <p> " Now , now , think strong , " Virgil says . " I 'm going to have the whole congregation pray for Allie . There 's strength in numbers . " <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father Nelson knew exactly what to say about her . " <p> " That 's because Allie wrote it out for him , " I say . Virgil raises his eyebrows and I shrug . <p> " That 's enough , Sydney , " Virgil says . " I was telling Ivey about keeping the right attitude earlier this morning . That goes for you too . " <p> Virgil is n't one of those white-haired , wrinkle-ridden priests . He 's blue jeans and black turtlenecks , dark wavy hair and a dimple in his chin . When I saw him at three this morning , he was just another man . <p> After I skipped town , leaving Allie , my husband , and Florida for a church man in a blue Ford truck one afternoon without warning , Allie started going to the evening church service rather than our regular Sunday morning one . The evening services have a youth choir and a drum set . The priests always want to shake your hand after the service . <p> " I have to go , " I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the boy sleeping across her lap is stroking his hair , and it moves me . <p> " There she goes again , " Sydney says . <p> I 'm halfway across the room when Sydney wraps her finger in my belt loop and drags me backwards to the seats . She sits me down next to her . <p> " If you 'd keep grounded long enough , you 'd know the nurse kicked me out of the room . " <p> Still in their coats , the old couple shuffle in their seats , and I can read them just fine . The last thing they want is a scene , and they 're hoping Virgil will be of some use . Waiting-room power is more than Virgil can take on . There 's nothing to do in waiting rooms except wonder when your true self will expose you . I 've seen it with the black men in the corner ; it 's how I learned they were brothers . Stevie was talking about Daddy , how he never did take care of his heart , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought meanness would always hold his daddy 's heart together . <p> One week from now I will hear Stevie and Eli discuss how they ca n't get their mother to come to the hospital . Eli will understand . When someone beats up on you for so long , the heart hardens-he knows . Two weeks later Stevie and Eli 's father will pass on late at night . I will stand outside the waiting room as Eli tells Stevie that their father could n't admit he 'd done wrong . You ca n't apologize for something you do n't think you 've done , I hear , but Stevie will cry because his father 's soul was n't set free before dying . <p> " Nurse Marge wanted to give Allie a bath , " Sydney says . " She said she 'd call when we could come back in . " <p> " I 've been there when she got a bath before , " I say . I look directly at Coat Woman , wanting her to side with me . She turns to Sally Jesse instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Sydney says . " It 's all different now . " <p> Virgil raises his hand as if he 's got the muscle to stop the conversation . <p> " All you have to do is say you want to stay , " I say . <p> Sydney straightens out the newspaper . She 's staring at the front page , but her eyes ca n't follow the headlines . " Maybe I did n't want to stay . " <p> Coat Woman grabs a Good Housekeeping from four years back . I can read her loud and clear . Oh , if the mother could only hear ; oh , not wanting to be with your mother ; oh , the poor soul . I shake my head from side to side , letting Coat Woman know I agree . <p> " Ivey , tell me a little about Allie , " Virgil says , " so I can share it with the congregation . " <p> " She 's selfish . She craves attention and holds grudges , " I say . Coat Woman holds the magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father so hard that he had a heart attack . Then she wanted people to feel for her loss . And she was bitter that Bones never passed on her gift to her . " <p> " That should about cover it , " Sydney says . <p> Coat Woman insists her husband switch seats with her . <p> " Virgil , " Sydney says , and leans against his shoulder , " you 'll have to forgive Ivey . She 's going to feel guilty about Allie because she has n't lived up to her own abilities . In addition , since she ran away from her own life and husband with some church bandit in a blue Ford truck who took her money and left after she married him , she 's been a little cranky . " <p> It 's a family trait , just like color blindness or baldness . My family tells strangers about our lives . <p> Coat Woman snaps her magazine pages . Oh , prayers for the poor mother . If Coat Woman could only comfort her , mother to mother . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allie has already explained the differences between the daughter she wanted and the one she got . Virgil wants to absolve me . <p> My attention is on the green-haired girl on TV explaining how she tried to run over her mother with the family car . Stevie takes off his cap , runs a hand through his hair , and laughs at the girl in her leather jacket and with her green hair . <p> " What about that , Eli , " Stevie says , pushing Eli 's shoulder . " How do you think Daddy would like that one ? " <p> " Stevie , " Eli says , and puts a hand on Stevie 's forearm . <p> " Rip our heads off , that 's how he 'd take talking out of line . Lord , if he could have heard us talk like that . " <p> Eli squeezes Stevie 's forearm . <p> Virgil ca n't take his eyes off me . <p> " I 'll say I 'm sorry , and you 'll have to forgive me , " I say to Virgil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Sydney begins spilling everything she knows about Allie before Virgil questions her . Sydney reveals Allie 's age , middle name , place of birth , how long she was married , the wedding date , Allie 's maiden name , how long she has lived in Florida , how long the diner had been open , Allie 's sign . <p> " I really wanted to know more about the whys of things , " Virgil says . " Like why did she go to church ? " <p> " To meet men after she killed my father , " I say . <p> Coat Woman snaps her head to me , but I 'm focused on the green-haired girl . I do n't need direct eye contact ; I 've got insight . <p> Virgil raises his pen , but the phone rings and silences everyone . The TV audience claps , welcoming another guest . Eli finally gets up to answer the phone , keeping his back against us . Coat Woman picks up her purse , one hand on the handle , the other one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Eli says , and hangs up the phone . <p> " Wrong number , " Stevie chuckles . " Wait until Dad hears that one . " <p> " The nurses never call , " I say . I have everyone 's attention , all except the woman in the far corner stroking the sleeping boy 's hair . Nothing disturbs her motion . <p> " There she goes again , " Sydney says . <p> " They forget , " I say directly to Coat Woman . " It 's work to them . " Coat Woman clutches her husband 's leg . <p> I do n't look back as I exit the room . Sally Jesse 's TV expert is saying the green-haired girl and her mother can be saved . The expert is about to reveal the key to healing when Sally Jesse breaks for commercial . <p> When I enter the hospital room , Nurse Marge tells me Allie will sleep for a while . That 's fine , I say , but Nurse Marge reminds me we agreed I 'd be gone for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say , trying to undo Allie 's restraints . <p> Nurse Marge checks Allie 's catheter . " You need to stay and watch her hands if you 're going to do that , " Nurse Marge says . <p> After walking away from Virgil in the waiting room at three in the morning , I found Allie in her bed , tubes and wires like puppet string connected to her , lights flashing , and her wrists bound to the bed railing . <p> " The restraints are for her protection , " Nurse Kristy had said . <p> I could n't keep my eyes off of Allie 's wrists . Allie coughed in her sleep and the ventilator sounded , red lights flashed , and I began backing up , but Allie and Nurse Kristy did n't flinch . <p> " She could pull the tube out in her sleep , " Nurse Kristy said . " It 's instinct for the body to react against anything forced on it . " <p> " Allie , " I said . I watched Nurse Kristy untie the restraints . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticing me . <p> " It 's Allie , " I said to Nurse Kristy . " Her name is Allie . " <p> " Of course , " Nurse Kristy said . " Well , Allie is a fighter , but the longer she 's on the machine , the more dependent she becomes . We need to encourage her to visualize herself free from the ventilator . " <p> I stopped backing up when I hit the sliding glass door . " It 's cancer and she should have seen it coming . So can we stop pretending now ? " <p> Nurse Kristy was watching Allie 's vitals on the monitor . " The tests have n't all come in . We are n't certain what we 're fighting . " <p> After Nurse Kristy had washed her hands , she turned out the light over Allie 's bed . She was going to leave me alone in the room with Allie . " What do I do ? " I asked . <p> It would be my most common question during the next year , " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What do I do ? " I asked when Allie beat me every time we play cards . " What do I do ? " I asked Sydney when Allie would n't get out of bed . The answer would soon come to me . " Here 's what to do , honey , " the hospice nurse said , " when she ca n't breathe and panics . " <p> Nurse Kristy scanned the room ; she had just noticed I had positioned myself at the back corner . She moved a chair next to Allie 's bed . " Just be there for her . " Nurse Kristy guided me from the back of the room into the chair . " Like she took care of you when you were sick . " <p> Nurse Kristy watched over me as I stared at Allie . Allie 's face had swelled . Her eyes and cheeks were puffy . The vision was n't immediate , and it came skewed and blurry , but it was of a little girl with chicken pox , fevers , bad dreams , toothaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center , comforting the body , inside and out . <p> Nurse Kristy took my hand and placed it in Allie 's . <p> " She wo n't know what happened when she wakes up , " Nurse Kristy said . " You 'll have to explain it . " The ventilator alarm in the next room sounded . " Or I can . " Allie 's ventilator alarm sounded in competition with the one next door and the volume packed the room . <p> Allie woke three hours later with tears in her eyes , touching the tube in the mouth . She tried to talk with her hands . She tried the sign language she 'd learned long ago to welcome a deaf new church member , but every time I guessed incorrectly she rolled her eyes , flung up her hands . She pulled at her tube . When I handed her a pencil and paper , she scribbled , " Nobody warned me . " <p> " You could n't breathe , " I kept saying . <p> When Nurse Kristy walked in with Nurse Marge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while their shift changed . I kissed Allie 's forehead and whispered that I would n't be gone for long , but Allie just rolled her eyes . <p> In the waiting room , the man was still there , watching TV , resting a newspaper on his lap . I picked up the phone to call Sydney and watched him watching the TV . <p> " Sydney 's on her way , Ivey , " the man had said , without moving from the TV . " I already called her . " <p> I put the phone back on the hook , sat across from the man , and watched the TV screen where the Pope was standing next to a life-sized Jesus hanging from the crucifix . I was n't concerned that this man knew my name . It did n't make me nervous that he knew Sydney 's number . I was taken by the picture of the Pope kissing Jesus ' foot , and also upset that this man had read my intentions so easily . <p> " I 'm Father Virgil , " the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I nodded at it and he recoiled . " I 'm Allie 's friend . She gave my name as a contact along with yours , just in case . . . " <p> " Just in case I was n't around , " I said . I was relieved some of my intuition had returned . I could n't blame Allie for having a back-up plan . Sydney lived three towns away , and although I had been with Alle steady for a month , I had a reputation of leaving without much notification . <p> " Just in case you and Sydney needed someone , " Virgil said . <p> The elevator 's bell went off every few seconds . Employees either starting or ending their shifts talked and laughed as if it were an ordinary workday . The Pope was still on , performing mass in front of swarms of people . The corner of the TV read Vatican City , and I caught only the words " historic , " " forgiveness , " and " for all ages " from the newscaster . <p> " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They only spend this much time on people who 've died . " <p> " Of course not , " Virgil said , and straightened in his seat . " The Pope has apologized . " <p> The old man on TV was frail and stooped . " What did he do wrong ? " I asked . <p> In the coming months both Allie and I will continue to give less than proper respect to the spirituality of dying . It will annoy Virgil that we credit Allie 's stubbornness more than God 's grace when Allie is discharged . The jokes about easy meal clean-ups when you have a stomach tube will not please Virgil . When Allie turns her wig backwards to indicate a bad hair day , Virgil will force a cracked smile , as he does when we use Allie 's suction rod as a magic wand and make Virgil disappear . But when Allie passes away in her own bed one early summer 's evening and I worry I 've gone over the edge because I can not stop rubbing Allie 's hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was over the edge long before Allie got sick . <p> " The Pope did nothing wrong , " Virgil said . " He 's asking God 's forgiveness for the sins of Roman Catholics everywhere . " <p> I fought off my own chill watching people step off the elevator , coats still zipped and buttoned , carrying their lunches , grumbling about a typical Monday morning . The two brothers walked out of the elevator , and their chatter blended with the repetition of " historic , " " forgiveness , " " for all ages . " <p> " Does that count ? " I asked Virgil . " Does it mean the same , apologizing for something you have n't done ? " <p> Virgil watched Eli go to the phone and Stevie sit in the chair as easily as if they had walked into their own home . The Pope placed his hands on Jesus ' calf , bent his head near Jesus ' knee . Jesus ' head angled so that he seemed to be consoling the Pope . Both men looked weary-and sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pope , " Virgil said . <p> Eli hung up the phone and turned to the TV . " Are you watching this ? " he asked me . <p> I said no before Virgil could object . Eli turned the TV to a sports show , and Stevie smiled at him , then sat with his hands on his knees , leaning so he could catch the TV words better . Eli opened his book . Stevie and Eli had their coats piled to one side , their legs stretched out ; they had settled in . <p> " The Pope , Ivey , is showing the world how to heal , " Virgil said . " Do you understand the power of an apology ? " <p> My toes were numb . The newspaper 's headlines read : Pontiff Asks Divine Pardon for Sins of the Past . " I have to go , " I said . " I 'm cold . " <p> I was out of the waiting room without another word to Virgil or even a nod to Stevie or Eli . I stood outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Sydney arrived she and Nurse Marge fought with me about taking a break until we agreed that I would be gone for an hour . <p> " But she 's only been gone for thirty minutes , " I hear Nurse Marge say . I grip Allie 's hand tightly in mine , and she caresses my knuckles with her thumb . <p> " Nurse Marge says you 've got thirty more minutes on your hour , " Sydney says . <p> I do n't look behind me , but I know she and Virgil are there . " I 'm not afraid of Nurse Sarge . " <p> Sydney takes my hand out of Allie 's and replaces it with her own . " I am , " Sydney says . Allie does n't seem to notice the difference , and I watch her thumb working against Sydney 's skin . " We 'll be here when you get back . " <p> Virgil places his hand on the middle of my back . " I 'm starving , " he says . " I thought you might drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Take your time , " Sydney says . " We 're not going anywhere . " <p> Virgil leads me out of the room , but I stop at the nurses ' station and face Virgil . " I left with the church man in the blue Ford truck because I thought I was running towards something , not away . He said he loved both me and God . I felt in good company . " <p> Before Virgil has opportunity to give his line , I hear laughter from one of the rooms and Virgil has to follow me as I search for the source . It 's a deep chuckling , and I finally see Eli sitting next to a hospital bed , Stevie on the other side , laughing like there 's no tomorrow . Eli continues reading to the man in the bed , who 's on a ventilator , his eyes closed . Stevie catches me standing outside ; he smiles and waves . I nod back . <p> Virgil reaches out to move me on , but I back up . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was following my own instincts when I took off down I-95 with a church man in a blue Ford truck , " I say . " And now I 'll never hear her talk to me again . " <p> " Do you want me to tell you it is n't your fault , Ivey ? " <p> I walk away from Virgil . <p> A moment later Virgil and I are standing in the back of the elevator watching the floor numbers get smaller as a man in green scrubs carrying vials of blood samples stands in front of us . <p> " Nurse Kristy says Allie has to visualize herself off the ventilator , " I say . " We have to encourage her to see herself off the machine . " <p> " It 's a different type of medicine , " Virgil says . " You can heal people by reaching out for spirit to heal . " <p> " Allie 's hard enough to reach when she 's awake . I ca n't imagine getting to her when she 's unconscious will be any easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The man in green scrubs turns , purposefully , just to match the words with a face . I meet his stare . <p> " Virgil here , " I say , and motion to Virgil , " is going to pray to his congregation for my mother to get well . There are people here advertising to be prayed for on the back windows of their cars , " I say , and lean forward . " I just want to know how many voices have to speak up in order for someone to get well in this hospital . " <p> The elevator doors close , and Virgil and I ride to the lobby . When the doors open , Virgil gets off , but I do n't move . <p> " Virgil , Allie is going to die . " <p> " Yes , " Virgil says . " Without apologizing for it , Ivey . " <p> A gust cold air hits me as I step off the elevator and walk through the lobby . In the parking lot , I spot the woman from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is over her shoulder , his eyelids opening and closing . <p> I 'm getting my keys out , putting on my sunglasses , walking opposite the woman . Virgil begins to drift over to the woman 's side of the parking lot . I try to flag down the golf-cart man so he can drive us to my car . <p> " Virgil , we have to get going , " I say . <p> Virgil watches the woman stop at the red hatchback . He reads her back window as the woman balances the sleeping boy while digging for her keys . <p> I wrap my arms around myself , but the wind cuts through my sweater . " Virgil , I 'm freezing . Let 's go . " I wait for his reply , but only hear " historic forgiveness for all ages " in Bones 's voice- " Take that with you , " she adds . <p> Virgil walks over to me . " The woman is asking for a prayer , Ivey . I 'm sorry , it 's my calling . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to say anything . He takes the sleeping child and places him in the backseat for the woman . <p> As I stand on the other side of the red hatchback , watching Virgil kneel at the back bumper and the woman follow him , I am told of the power of an apology . It 's a power that two months from now will allow me to hold Allie as she 's told the chemotherapy has n't decreased the cancer , and afterwards it will allow me to understand when Allie refuses to eat , to bathe , to get up even to go to the bathroom . It is a power that says it 's Allie 's decision to let her body deteriorate . And it will allow me to understand when Allie closes her eyes two days before she dies and never opens them again . <p> I stand across from Virgil , catching his phrases , " Lord , help , " " strength to bear , " " will be done , " and I pick up his words and ask Bones for help . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bones replies . So I ask , " God comfort the woman across the way . God make me cross over and join them . " <p> But feet do n't fly just because they 're requested to , and when Virgil rises and helps the woman off the ground , I close my eyes in the hospital parking lot and ask for my mother 's soul to hear me . <p> I feel hands grab on to mine . Allie , the power of an apology is its ability to soothe , even long after a hurt has been done . I see Allie in her favorite dress , no shoes on , no tubes or trache either . I pray , Mom , that in the time we have together and the distance that keeps us apart , we will touch each other with our ability to soothe . Bones stands next to Allie ; I feel the hands let go of mine and they are gone . <p> I open my eyes and Virgil is standing across from me . " Amen , " he says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
