Mankind does n't need Art , what he needs is stories . G. K. Chesterton It was four days before the bodies were discovered , by which time Mr Cowper had begun to mottle . He was lying underneath the kitchen window , where the sunlight caught him every afternoon . Sunlight and corpses do not mix . Mrs Cowper fared somewhat better , having fallen in the hallway , which was shaded and much cooler . Springtime came as a surprise . It had been the gloomiest of winters . We had even been denied the consolatory dramas of heavy rain or a snowstorm . Our village can usually look forward to being cut off at least once a year ; the roads round here are terrible . Instead , the winter was grey an endless , anaesthetising grey . For almost all of January and February , the days hardly seemed to break ; it was simply that the nights thawed a little during the course of each morning , before hardening again mid-afternoon . I drove down the country lanes to work each morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I glanced upwards through the grimy windscreen of my car and thought how heavy the outlook seemed to be , how oppressive the density of the cloud cover . It was March before a little weak sun bled through , as if the cumuli were a huge swathe of bandaging folded haphazardly across the great wound of the sky . Warmer weather finally arrived in April , with a suddenness which implied it should be mistrusted . I was worried that we might get a late frost and could n't decide whether or not to put in some earlypotatoes there was nothing in the patch except for a couple of brussel plants which had over-wintered there in ugly splendour . In the end , I decided not to bother . I find it hard to get excited about vegetables . Instead , while two of my neighbours were swelling , gently , I took advantage of the lighter evenings to enjoy my flowers . I think back to that time now and wonder what I was doing , what I was trying to grow , as their bodies became less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know that death occurs in an instant . One minute you are a subject , the hero or heroine of your own particular story : the next , you are a thing , an object which can be acted upon by anyone who has access to you . You can be lifted , carried , dissected . You can be ignored . I know it 's stupid call it a guilty conscience , perhaps but I ca n't help feeling that while I weeded my borders during the course of that week , the Cowpers were becoming more and more dead , and that if someone had discovered them earlier , they would have been less so . As it was , they were found on the Friday morning because a council workman noticed that they had n't put their wheely bin out . We are religious about wheely bins round here . Every Friday , you can see them standing sentinel outside each cottage . People in this village may not speak to their neighbours for years , but we all walk past each other 's wheely bins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are looking , whether any wheels are missing or what might protrude from underneath the lids . Miss Crabbe next door , for instance ; fills hers with newspaper . I fill mine with garden refuse . I was filling it that week , trying to clear the profusion of weeds which was threatening to spoil the previous year 's efforts . The narcissi were out already , which was nice . I like them much more than daffodils ; their pale faces in the twilight , the scent . I had some tulips as well , apple-dawn red , but my favourites were the wallflowers . They smelt so wonderful after rain the texture of their petals was of such soft depth . I wonder if I was weeding around my wallflowers as Mr and Mrs Cowper cooled in their cottage that Monday evening . I wonder if I was considering my arabis , what good ground cover it made , as their bodies stiffened on the Tuesday . Perhaps on the Wednesday I was regarding the heavy heads of the peonies , as Mr Cowper 's flesh discoloured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my garden look as if it belongs to an old person . I am only twenty-seven . Forget-me-nots sow themselves . I might have thought this as Mrs Cowper 's bodily fluids drained to her back she was found lying on her back or perhaps I was cutting my rose bushes down and praying that I was n't going to be plagued with mildew . Mildew of one sort or another is my biggest problem . What is the worst thing I have ever done ? I do n't know . To be a murderer , you have to have malicious intent , do n't you ? I have never done a deliberately malicious thing in my life . My working week had begun as always , at the Magistrates ' Court held each Monday morning at Oakham Castle . The last time I had been there was for the inaugural meeting of the new Rutland County Council , like a wedding with its pomp and ceremony the councillors in their finery , accompanying wives in suits and hats , the press and other hoi polloi at the back on wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the green and yellow bunting still trembled in the market square . That morning , it was business as usual . I was there just before ten . The solicitors were already in place and a small gathering of defendants dotted along the benches . The Great Hall is the only place in the county guaranteed to be cool in the hottest of weather the stone walls exude a medieval chill . I was wearing my thin black denim jacket and shivered as I stepped out of the inefficient morning . I glanced over at the defendants as I passed . There was Tim Gordon , again , up on another charge of driving a motor vehicle without insurance or proper licensing . I went to school with Tim and could still remember him at ten years old , plump and friendly , running around the playground clutching a plastic trumpet . We were quite chummy then . By thirteen , our ways had parted , peeling asunder to encircle opposite ends of the educational spectrum . I was studying for O-levels in six different subjects and CSEs in four . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still see him occasionally , lurking at the end of the school drive with a bunch of other no-hopers we called the Drongos . He waved sometimes , but adolescence had intervened and my social standing meant I could n't possibly return his greeting . Fifty years ago , Tim might have become a farming hand or a gamekeeper 's helper , but there 's no work for the men around here these days . As far as I know he 's always been unemployed . His dad has a junk yard behind their house in Market Overton . I think he helps out there occasionally . It was his eighth or ninth appearance in court . After each one , he would shuffle over and grin in the way that somebody who has known you since you were five can grin . Then he would ask me not to put his name in the paper , so that his parents would n't find out . I always told him I 'd have to run it past my editor , but he never made it in . His offences were so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not even the Rutland Record needs lineage that badly . As I walked past he gave me the grimace , anticipating our familiar exchange , sticking his tongue between his teeth and wobbling a large hand from side to side in a jokey wave . My boss was there , sat solidly on the press bench with the court list spread out before him . He had already removed his jacket and rolled up his sleeves . His arms were folded across his broad chest and his hands tucked into his armpits . He was leaning back and chatting up Gail , the usher . Doug looked up as I approached . All right , m'duck ? ' his usual Monday morning greeting . All right , ' I replied . I mouthed hello to Gail and slid onto the bench next to Doug . Anything doing ? ' Doug pushed a copy of the list across to me , the papers rasping on the bench 's wooden surface . Nah , Alison , we 'll be out by twelve . A couple of assaults and an affray that mad lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other and have done with it , I do n't know . ' It used to irritate me that Doug sat in on the court sessions , until I realised that he did it for his benefit , not mine . Doug had been editor of the Record for eighteen years . He had worked on local newspapers in some capacity or other since he left grammar school . He was not in good health and due to retire soon . In the meantime , he liked to feel that there was a bit of pure news reporter in him still , that there was more to his job than overseeing the advertising and making sure the Village Correspondents filed their copy by Wednesday afternoon . He was aching for something big to happen , just once . I glanced through the court list . Most of the names were familiar . I flipped open my notepad and arched my back , looking up at the dark wooden beams above me , charred bones against the white plaster ceiling . They always made me think of gibbets . I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrupulousness of its modern usage . The morning 's business was a matter of plodding through the list , case by case , with all the usual , reductive formality . Any event , however vital , became procedure . The moment of passion the drunken decision , the flailing fist drained of all intensity by detail . Most of the cases would be adjourned . The traffic offences would have fines set . It would be more appropriate to our setting , I sometimes thought , if a sobbing villager was dragged before us in chains and sentenced to be hanged for stealing a rabbit . The door banged open . I looked up and saw the Thomson family shouldering their way into court ; livid-faced Mr Thomson , his nervous , clingy wife and Jeremy , their thick-set son . The Thomsons were in continuous feud with the Smarts , another Whissendine family . I 'd never quite worked out the precise nature of their differences except that it all went way back and erupted into affray approximately twice a year . For their court appearances , each man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stringy wife . In the dock , they addressed the leading magistrate as sir ' or ma'am ' , heads bowed respectfully , trying to outdo each other in their courtesy . They never so much as acknowledged each other . They saved the arguments for their home turf . All rise ! ' called Gail , and there was a shuffling and scraping as we scrambled to our feet for the magistrates , two women and one man , who processed forth from an ante-room behind the bench . They seated themselves in a row beneath the expansive wall covered in huge , decorative horseshoes the collection is one of the town 's chief tourist attractions and the session began . The Rutland Record claims to be England 's oldest newspaper , although I think the name has changed over the centuries . It used to be a broadsheet coveting corn prices and the activities of the local highwaymen . It went tabloid in the eighties , like everything else , then duly came close to going out of business . At the last minute , it became the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friendly takeover . The Shires Periodical Group already owned half the local newspapers in the region and a stock of trade magazines . We became the smallest , the cutest , item on their books . Nobody expected us to make any money . We had been bought as a sort of mascot , or pet . Actually , we turn in a small profit . Doug opposed the takeover on principle , but even he was forced to concede that it proved beneficial . Pensions and healthcare packages appeared in the staff contracts . There was a sudden influx of office furniture . That was all before my time , but when I arrived Doug was still fond of remarking that the wooden chairs they had used before obliged you to grow fat , so that whichever desk you sat at , you had your own padding . Gone are the days of clickety-clack , even in Rutland . Production staff send our camera-ready copy by modem to a printer in Grantham , who has the papers delivered back to Oakham in the small hours of the morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brand new picture scanner arrived , Doug stood in the subs ' room while they unpacked it , and wept . At the time of the Cowper case , there were two and a half reporting staff , counting Doug . I was Chief Reporter , and Cheryl was part-time everything else ; Deputy Editor , legal expert , obituarist and Sports Correspondent . Officially , she worked a half-week , but in practice she was far senior to me . On the rare occasions that Doug took a holiday , Cheryl swept in . She fancied herself as something of a matriarch , always telling me I ought to grow my hair and put on some weight while letting Doug know that he ought to lose some of his and get a decent trim . Rumour had it that she and Doug had once been lovers but I found it hard to believe . They were both in their late fifties . She was married to a man in Stamford who was into racehorses . They had three teenage sons . Doug lived alone , a widower . Our office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute 's walk from the Castle . The production and advertising staff were on the ground floor . Cheryl and I had a first-floor office and Doug sat in isolationist splendour in an attic office opposite the junk room we call the Library . On market day in summer , it was possible to throw open the sash windows and pick up local gossip and potential stories as they drifted up from the stallholders and customers , floating skywards amongst the hoarse , disinterested cries of Peaches ten for a pound ' and Twenty half o'mush ' . After an hour and a half , I left the court session . The rest of it was going to be a series of non-appearances and adjournments . Doug would stay in case anything unexpected came up and he was thinking of buying a caravan from Gail 's brother and wanted to have a chat with her about it . There was n't much for that week 's paper . We were all sick of Independence stories and so were the readers . We wanted something fresh to cover but were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to get on the phone . Each Monday , I put a call through to my friend Bill at the fire station and he tells me if anything has happened over the weekend . It was Bill who fed me the bananas , my first story for the Record , one small paragraph which is now framed and hanging on my kitchen wall . Missing Bananas A Belmesthorpe farmer made a surprise discovery on Tuesday morning when he happened upon sixty-three boxes of bananas which had been dumped in one of his fields . An appeal has been made for the owner to come forward . We 're baffled , ' a police spokesperson has admitted . When my brother Andrew saw the story he said , Oh , for God 's sake ... ' What 's wrong ? ' I asked . The title , ' he said . It was n't the bananas which were missing , it was the owner . Everybody knew exactly where the bananas were . ' Andrew has always been a pedant . During the week , all I need to do is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred yards down the High Street . I can hear the siren as it starts up . I go to the window and watch to see which way the engine is going , then get on the phone to the Village Correspondents in that direction and get them to look out of their windows too . If I guess right , the engine can be tracked halfway across the county . As I crossed the Castle grounds I thought that I should ring the Whissendine Correspondent and find out if there were any rumours about the latest fracas between the Thomsons and the Smarts . I would n't be able to use any background until after the trial but it would be good to get a few notes done in advance . The only flurry of excitement in court that morning had been over one of the assault cases , an Oakham man in a suede jacket , up for punching his girlfriend . Just before his case was called , the door opened and a thin young man about my age sidled into the court . Everybody paused as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming to have a look around who do n't realise that the Castle is closed on Mondays and Gail has to usher them out . We had three Japanese once . It took quite a while to explain . ) After a short exchange , Gail gestured the newcomer towards the press bench . He walked swiftly across the court , head down , trying to be as inconspicuous as possible which made him riveting to watch . He crossed the bench behind us , then slid in next to me . The bench crackled . Doug is not the sort to waste time on social niceties . He leant forward across me . Who are you ? ' he hissed to the young man . David Poe , ' he whispered back . Press Agency . ' The nationals had descended en masse for Independence , chortling into their notepads and churning out stories that made us sound like characters from an Ealing comedy . The following day , they all disappeared , vultures who had got wind of a fresher carcass . What are you doing here ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' bench . I pressed myself back to facilitate the exchange . This Browning , ' David Poe replied , indicating the man in suede , who was talking to his solicitor . Rumour has it he 's a friend of a cousin of Jeremy Beadle . The Star are interested . ' Doug let out a short but resonant laugh , his head snapping back and his mouth opening in an exhalation of derision which echoed round the hall . Heads in the courtroom turned . Gail stepped towards us , frowning , and Doug lifted the flat of his hand , nodding an apology . The friend of the cousin of Jeremy Beadle had finished talking to his brief , a black-suited woman who , while she talked , had been tidying up a scattering of pens and pencils on the table in front of her and pushing them into a plastic pencil case in the shape and design of a packet of Walkers Crisps . She rose to address the Bench , asking for an adjournment for probation reports to be obtained . The adjournment was granted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to leave the court , David Poe eased himself from the bench and sidled out , following . Doug leant sideways towards me , arms still folded . He 'll have a fine time if he tries to doorstep that Browning , ' he muttered from the side of his mouth . He 's liable to get a punch up the bracket . ' As I crossed the empty market square half an hour later , I saw David Poe standing in the doorway of the Nearly New shop , looking as though a punch up the bracket might have been exactly what he 'd got . He was frowning and muttering and slapping a mobile phone . I stopped and watched him for a moment , unable to resist the temptation to be helpful . Excuse me , ' I called across the square . He looked up , still frowning . He was sitting next to me a minute ago , I thought . Now he ca n't even remember who I am , the pillock . His fringe was too long and his hair fell forward over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tossing motions with his head which added to his air of irritation . There 's a pay phone right there . ' I pointed back towards the butter cross , where the red telephone box stood out like a beacon among the stone buildings . He nodded , still frowning , then broke into an unexpected smile , as if he had just caught sight of himself in my eyes . He lifted the mobile phone in one hand and shrugged . Thank you , ' he called . As I opened the door to the office , I wondered whether I should have invited him in to use our phone but I knew Doug would be back soon , and if David Poe thought Mr Browning was truculent he had yet to witness a full demonstration of Doug 's contempt for the national press . Our biggest fear at the Record was that something newsworthy would happen on a Thursday afternoon when the paper was going to press . When a Tornado jet from the RAF base at South Luffenham crashed into Quakers Spinney last autumn , it timed its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the last copy of the Record rolling off the printer 's press in Grantham . Worst-case scenario . Doug had to make an on-the-spot decision . If we were going to re-write the front page he would have to ring the printer , tell him to pulp every paper and stop his staff going home . All he had was a report of an explosion from the Correspondent in Ayston . Doug was cautious by nature but I think something must have got to him with that one , some tingling in the fingertips perhaps . Cheryl and I were making ready to get our coats on when he appeared in the doorway and announced , Something 's broke at Ayston . I can smell it . ' He rang the printer from my phone . Pulp the lot of them , ' he said . We 'll have the new pages by midnight . ' It paid off . The two-man crew of the Tornado had been killed and a crater twenty foot deep left in the charred forestry . A Ridlington family out on a picnic was missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ albeit in the summary . The family turned up safe and sound the next day but it did n't spoil Doug 's professional satisfaction . We had scooped every local paper for miles . If something big happens on a Friday , there 's nothing we can do . By then , the Record has been delivered to hundreds of homes across the county and is stacked neatly in every newsagent . We sit glumly at our desks with the weary feeling that the weekend ought to have started . Everybody feels like a day off after press day but there 's next week 's paper to fill . We ca n't afford to leave it all until Monday . A big story breaking on a Friday is something of a relief . It wakes everybody up for a start , and gives us plenty of time to do the background before we have to go to press . This story , my story , the murder of the Cowper family , began that Friday . I was still at home but about to leave for the office . I hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up early . I have a bath and play with the water . My Friday morning treat is to do it without the radio on , so I do n't have to listen to the news . It is the only concession I make to having put the paper to bed the day before . My first intimation that something was about to start happening came as I was standing at my kitchen window , finishing my third mug of tea . I often stand there in the mornings , leaning forward against the sink , looking out at the rose bushes in the narrow border between my front aspect and the lane . I like planning things that way . I like planning more roses . I was clutching my mug in both hands and wondering if I had cut the bushes back a bit too far . My favourite moment of the gardening year is when the first tiny red shoots appear . It was then that I heard the vehicle speeding down Brooke Road , some way distant but approaching , rapidly . It did n't sound like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gear . I knew immediately that this meant something . Nothing ever speeds through Nether Bowston . It is n't on the way to anywhere . It was an ambulance , swaying smoothly , down the narrow road , with no flashing light or siren . It was followed closely by a police car , also silent . I put down my cup and picked up my bag from the kitchen table . I slammed the front door behind me and was rooting in the bag as I went down the stone path to my gate . The notepad was in my hand as I rounded the corner by Ostlewaite 's Barn . At the end of the road , there was a large detached cottage built of clean red brick . It was one of the few red-brick buildings in the village and always looked very new , perhaps because it was so immaculate . The front lawn was a neat , borderless rectangle , the driveway a short sweep of sandy-coloured shingle . The five-barred gate was creosoted , and , as far as I remember , always closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived there . They had a daughter , I thought ; I was n't sure . The house was on the edge of the village , the last house on a road that led out to open fields . They were not a family that mixed . There was no sign of them . The ambulance and police car had parked on the verge . Three other patrol cars were parked in a line further down the road . The ambulance 's back doors were open but the paramedics seemed inactive , standing with their arms folded , talking to one of the officers surrounding the cottage . The front door of the cottage was also open . I could see several bulky , dark figures in the hallway . One of them was bending down . I was looking at the house as I approached and nearly walked into the line of tape that two officers were stretch . ing across the road , reaching from a sapling on the right-hand side to a fence post on the left . I stopped , momentarily confused that my way should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his end of the tape . He was a thick-set , middle-aged man with a solid , hard expression . I knew most of the local force but I did n't know him . He gazed at me briefly , then shook his head . I peered past him to try and see an officer I recognised . Somebody would tell me what was going on . It was a muggy day , that day . All week , the mornings had been gloomy , the afternoons sunny and the nights dense and close . The pattern had shown no signs of breaking and despite a slight breeze , the clouds seemed bunched up in the birdless sky , as if pressure from elsewhere was squeezing them together . The air felt thick , warm without being comfortable . It was a morning that held no trace of brightness . An officer emerged from the house and paused on the doorstep , then rested a hand on the door-frame for balance while he lifted a foot and examined the sole of his shoe . I glanced behind me . Nobody else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first on the scene . I remember thinking , it 's not like me to hesitate .
