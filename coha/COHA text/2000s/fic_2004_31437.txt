Chapter One Up on the roof , Eddie stands in front of me with a champagne bottle sticking out from between his thighs like a green glass penis . " Very funny , " I say , but of course I laugh , because I always laugh at Eddie 's antics . Thick , blond hair falls across his green eyes as he struggles with the wire casing , then the cork . He looks up , shakes the hair out of his face , and flaunts a cunning smile . " We have to celebrate , darling ! " He wrenches the cork from side to side and gyrates his hips , mumbling , " Come on , baby . Come to daddy . " " Jesus , Eddie , " I say . " Are you fucking it or opening it ? " " It 's the only way I can get it , sugar . " " Sugar ? " I say with a snort , but I like it and he knows it . I turn and look over the edge of the roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Brooklyn Bridge shines golden in the failing late spring sun . Five stories below , yellow cabs , black town cars , and graffiti-covered delivery trucks roll through the congested grid of East Village streets . They compete with rollerbladers , bicyclists , and pedestrians . The sidewalks are crowded with hipsters , tourists , dog walkers , baby pushers , old women pulling shopping carts , and bums asking for change . I love this neighborhood . These are my people - the ones who choose to be in this tiny corner of the world because they find beauty in its roughness , just as I do . " Oh , yeah . Oh , yeah , " Eddie moans as he works on the cork . " I can feel it now . Here it comes . " " Do you need some help ? " I ask him , then tease , " from a professional ? " " O ye of little faith , " he says in his sweet southern drawl . Ever since I 've known him , Eddie 's liked to pretend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baffled by big-city ways . But the truth is , he 's been kicking around New York for the past ten years and is more citified than I am , and I grew up here . Plus , his soft gentile hands with their perfectly manicured nails and the ' 85 Krug Brut champagne he 's opening expose him as a fourth-generation Princeton grad and grandson of a textile magnate from the great state of Georgia . " Here it comes , " says Eddie . " Just a little more . Oh , oh , oh ! " He stands up straight and juts his hips forward as the cork arcs into the evening sky . Champagne shoots out from between his legs , and he howls with delight . There 's nothing Eddie likes more than a party , even if it is just the two of us on a roof . Never to be outdone by him , I grab the bottle and bring it to my lips . Let the bubbles tickle my nose before I take the first greedy gulp . The champagne scratches my throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before I can take another swig , he scoops me up , one arm under my knees , the other across my back , and gallops around the roof , singing , " Happy Anniversary ! " to the tune of the Lone Ranger theme song . We twirl in circles . The sunset blurs . Water towers , chimneys , and satellite dishes spin . Horn honks , tire squeals , laughter , and shouting burble up from the streets and meld into an urban symphony . In Eddie 's arms , I am perfectly suspended between the earth and sky . Nothing 's holding me down . I could fly away and soar past the just-rising moon with my hair on fire and my arms spread wide like a human shooting star over Manhattan . Then we collapse , champagne splashing , tiny plates of hors d'oeuvres crashing , onto a white tablecloth spread over the warm tar of the roof . In the center is a huge bouquet of yellow roses . Eddie 's gift to me on my restaurant 's first anniversary . He props himself up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it , Lem . Congratulations ! " He raises the frothing bottle to his lips . He 's right . I have done it . After ten years of regrets , mistakes , stupid moves , and pure dumb luck , I 've gotten what I want . No one expected this from me , least of all myself . I came into the world as a colicky , jaundiced baby with fuzzy blond hair like a troll . My parents named me Ellie Manelli but called me Lemon , which is n't much better . They left me behind with my grandmother and four aunts in Brooklyn to pursue their beatnik lifestyle , then ended up on the bottom of a river . When I hit eighteen , I took off from the cloistered streets of my small Brooklyn neighborhood to traipse around Europe with every other lost soul looking for some semblance of self . I returned defeated and spent years wandering from job to job , never happy , never satisfied , until I decided to stop grousing and waiting for something to happen . A year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom floor of this building , and I opened my restaurant , Lemon , named after me . Now suddenly , I 've became the new It Girl of the New York cooking world . Various trend-spotters have dubbed Lemon " hot " and part of the " downtown scene . " I 've been declared a " hip young chef " to watch . A picture of me , complete with my blond hair streaked blue to match my Le Creuset saucepans , graces the pages of Gourmet magazine this month to celebrate our anniversary . I do n't know how it happened . Who turned out to be my fairy godmother . Or if the karmic scales finally tipped in my favor . If I were n't such a cynic , I might claim that every experience in my life has led me to this shining moment , but I think that 's bullshit . All I know is , my luck in life has changed , and it 's about damned time . " How about some of these here whores de vors ? " Eddie asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth . The goose liver melts slowly , and I moan happily . He lays a roasted hen-of-the-woods mushroom and goat cheese phyllo purse on my outstretched tongue . When I 'm done with that , he tosses me a bright green cerignola olive . I swallow the fruity salty brine , then wash it all down with more champagne . " Goddamn , I 'm a good cook ! " I holler . " You 're super hot , " Eddie says like James Brown . " A bad-ass mo-fo , " I tell him . " A kicking , killing , slamming , jamming , crazy cooking Italian . " We toast again and howl our laughter at the night sky . " But you know , " Eddie says and leans in close . " You 'd taste better than anything down in that silly restaurant of yours . " He breathes warm breath onto my cheek . " I want to ravage you until you 're as creamy as this here goose liver . " He nips at my neck . " I 'll whip you into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ear . He smells like olive oil . Always like olive oil . My love for the past five years . Who ever thought it would last this long ? I met Eddie when I was a sous-chef at a fake Italian restaurant on the Upper West Side . He came to sell olive oil from his import business to the executive chef , a lazy cook and a lout with horrible hygiene . Eddie saw through the pretense of the oversalted ossobuco and rubbery tagliatelle . I only saw his eyes , green and laughing , sharing a joke with me . I handed him a slice of my roasted red pepper ciabatta dipped in his best extra virgin oil , and he licked his lips . His hands find their way under my chef 's jacket . " You are as rich and creamy as eggs benedict , " he says . " Crme brle has nothing on you . " When I first started going out with Eddie , I figured we 'd have a few laughs , drink a few bottles of wine , and eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd never think that we would last . Eddie is every inch the prep school brat , certain of entitlements from the world . I embody my Brooklyn upbringing , complete with the huge chip on my shoulder carried proudly like an epaulet . But beneath our facades , each of us is as ornery as the other one . Maybe that 's what keeps us together . " I could turn you into soup , " he says and flicks the snaps of my bra . " What kind ? " I grab his soft earlobe with my sharp teeth . " Vichyssoise . " He draws the word out as if it 's luxury . I look up . The sun has set , but the stars are hidden by the glare of city lights . The moon is lonely , with only red-tailed jets to share the sky . " What else ? " I beg . This is our joke . The only way into me is through food . He reads me like a menu . " You are as tender as a lamb chop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuzzles , kneads , and tickles my tingling skin . " You are as voluptuous as uh , uh ... Oh , hell . " He stops and looks at me . " What do the French call those purple things ? " " Eggplants ? " " Aubergines ! " he says triumphantly and slides my checked pants over my hips . My hands find him . " I am merguez ! " He rolls the word across his tongue as if he is some conquistador , and we wail at the moon . " Now , " I say , and I mean it . " Now ! " Eddie does n't need to be told twice . He 's there already . Away we go . Again , the sky blurs and sounds merge . Everything falls together like all matter sucked deep into a big black hole . My mother at the bottom of the ocean waves her bony hand , her hair is seaweed strands , she rides an electric eel . My father , buried beneath the Greenwood soil , rolls over in his grave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is it ! Tonight is my night , and I could devour the world . Catch it by the heels . String it up in a tree from a looping snare . Skin it , fillet it , saut it . Serve it on a platter with bitter wild leeks and potentially poisonous mushrooms shaped like flying saucers . Surround it with delicacies of the rivers and the sea . ( Gifts from my long-dead mother . ) Exotics from my larder . ( One thing from every place I 've ever been . ) An eclectic stew of me . I let go a whoop , a holler , a self-satisfied scream for all the world to hear . I am a T-Rex skulking . A warhead launching . A woman to be reckoned with . Watch out , I warn , as I roar with delight . Nothing can stop me now ! ( Continues ... )
