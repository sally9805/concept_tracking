" We need more restrictions on vehicles and wildlands . And public lands-though they belong to all of us-are no place for the cow , tractor , haulage truck , or oil well . " - Randy Long , Salt Lake City , Utah , responding to the Wilderness Act Reform Coalition ( WARC ) ' s efforts to " reform " the Wilderness Act ( Signpost , May ) . WARC , coalition of industry and government interests , favors " multiple use " of federally protected wilderness and vows to undo current wildlandsprotection laws . ORVS : H LOVE-HATE THING ORVers are linked with the timber industry because of their shared interest in motorized access to the backcountry , not because off roaders support timber 's slash-and-burn harvest techniques ( " The Case Against Roads , " May ) . Jim Kermode Sunnyvale , CA As a lifelong hiker , backpacker , and ORV enthusiast , I must comment on your yellow journalism . ORV use is growing , as your article points out , but just where are these citizens to go ? Last year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Forest Service lands , while about 5,000 miles were permanently eradicated . If 34 million acres of national forest out of the total 192 million acres is n't enough for the 3 percent of the population who carry backpacks , then how much is enough That does n't even include the millions of acres of national parks , monuments , and state parks already off limits to ORVers . We are simply trying to maintain access to lands we have been using , and caring for upwards of 50 years . Wayne Dresser Fresno , CA When I hike , it 's my habit to pick up and tote out trash I find . Recently , while on North Carolina 's Black Mountain Trail , I did n't find any refuse in 2 days of hiking . The final night , my partner and I stayed at the Deep Creek shelter , a pleasant , rustic place with what amounted to a garbage dump in front . The next morning , it took us 2 hours to fill four large garbage bags . We could n't pack it all out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside the ATV trail that accessed the hut . I know there are ATVers who love and protect the land , but when will someone come up with a way to screen out the bums ? Jim Davenport Chattanooga , TN WATERMAN 'S LAST DAYS If Guy Waterman was terminally ill and had the full blessings of his family to take his life on Mt . Lafayette , New Hampshire , then I can almost-but not quite-consider his actions excusable ( Signpost , May ) . Your blurb on him did not mention if he had such a condition . If , on the other hand , he simply felt like hiking to his death , then it was nothing less than a selfish suicide , and unfair to him , his family , and his admirers . David Besnette Boulder , CO By all accounts , Waterman was not terminally ill , The circumstances surrounding his death remain a mystery , known only to a circle of close friends . - The Editors It seems a little hypocritical to espouse the concept of " leave no trace , " as Waterman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain to die and leave your body for others to " pack out . " Rick Zollinhofer Grandview , TN STICKER SHOCK I know I 'm not alone when I say that backpacking clothing is way over priced . A $55 T-shirt ( " The Great T-Shirt Test , " May ) ? Give me a break ! A fleece jacket for $185 ( Outfitting , May ) ? It 's polyester , not gold ! Is it going to take a Microsoft-type legal action from the government to make manufacturers realize consumers are fed up with these prices ? Chris Herman Farmington , NM UGLY BUGS Looking at those close-up photos of blackflies and mosquitoes only confirmed what I already knew : They 're as ugly as they are painful ( Wild Things , May ) . By the way , the best bug repellent I 've used is Ole Time Woodsman Fly Dope , made by Pete Rickard , Inc. , ( 800 ) 282-5663 . Norman T. Marten Jr . Chappaqua , NY NATURAL WONDERS Jjohn Harlin 's suggestion of visiting the headwaters of the Merced , Illilouette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent ( " The Natural Wonders , " West/Summer , May ) . An alternate starting point is Mono Meadow trailhead , which starts at Mono Meadow ( 7,200 feet ) and eliminates the grueling and crowded John Muir Trail leaving Yosemite Valley ( 4,000 feet ) . It makes for a wonderful 50 to 60 miles of beautiful scenery , the fishing is fair , plus there 's low-to-moderate trail traffic . The park concessionaire will drop hikers at all trailheads for a fee . You 'll find another example of water falling up at Bridal Veil Falls , also in Yosemite Valley . On breezy afternoons , I 've seen water blowing back up over the brink of the hanging valley . Thomas Ortega Riverside , CA The endangered red-cockaded woodpecker lives exclusively in old-growth longleaf pine , not slash pine as noted in the May issue ( East/Spring ) . It 's endangered because only 3 percent of longleaf 's 92 million presettlement acres remain , due to centuries of clear-cutting and a century of fire suppression . Frequent fire retains the open , savannalike longleaf forests that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer to saving these and a myriad other endangered species .

Do n't look for the Skiemont Lodge sign at the turn near the trailhead , though . Instead , look for the Tussey Mountain sign . John Middlesworth H Reisterstown , MD KEEP THE CANS The idea of removing trash cans from national parks and asking people to dispose of their refuse outside park boundaries is great in theory ( Signpost , May ) . But does n't it stand to reason that some people will use the roadside , instead of waiting until they come across a roadside garbage can ? The cost of cleanup and damage to the environment could be far greater than what 's now being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , MI DOG DAYS Pet Peeves " ( April ) highlighted an aspect of public land management I find disturbing : managers making decisions based not on evidence , but on assumptions . For instance , dogs are banned from part of the Rattlesnake National Recreation Area , Montana , because land managers assumed giardia was caused by dogs . Now , 15 years later , there are no dogs , but they still have giardia ! It 's far too easy to play on prejudices and false assumptions than to find out if allegations are true . Kurt Neuswanger Grand Junction , CO The automobile is far more threatening to wildlife than a loose dog . So for those using this weak case to get dogs kicked out of the woods , I suggest you walk to your favorite destination next time . The wildlife will appreciate this simple act far more than banning dogs from the woods . Mike Cammack Durango , CO MOUNTAIN CULTURE I grew up close to the Bavarian Alps and I understand why people admire the European culture and charm , but American mountains have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Environmentalists like John Muir made sure you do n't find a restaurant on every other mountain , as you do in most parts of the Alps . Sleeping in a tent , experiencing bears and rattlesnakes , and being far from civilization are all part of the mountain experience here in the United States . Be proud of the mountain culture you have created . Many people from abroad admire it .
