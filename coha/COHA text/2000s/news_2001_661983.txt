<p> Here are excerpts from editorials in newspapers about Tuesday 's attacks on the United States . <p> The Washington Post : <p> The horrific terrorist attacks yesterday in New York and Washington will rank as one of the greatest calamities in American history , and will confront the United States with one of its most demanding challenges . Not since Dec. 7 , 1941 , has the U.S. homeland sustained such an aggression . The nation responded then without panic but with iron determination to defend itself and punish the aggressors . The response today must be as decisive - to the mass murderers who planned and carried out the attack , and to any nation or nations that gave them shelter and encouragement . <p> The Los Angeles Times : <p> Nationwide , people swarm blood banks , eager to have their own blood flow into the veins of those wounded by an unknown enemy . Let that enemy note that this nation of many peoples is often at odds within itself but under pressure is united ; a blow against one is a blow against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is their Pearl Harbor ; their Kennedy assassination . <p> As we garner strength by joining together in rage and sorrow , the world will see that the great experiment - e pluribus unum - continues . One way it will continue will be for Americans to refrain from blaming groups for the evil acts of individuals . There must be no fingerpointing based on ethnicity or religion . If Americans turn on each other , those behind the heinous acts will be the winners . <p> Never again can this nation be quite so secure . Tuesday was a day that changed America . <p> The Philadelphia Inquirer : <p> We feel rage . We feel fear . We are bewildered . We ca n't avoid acting on those feelings . Yet we must calibrate our response against the ideals of liberty and tolerance that have made this nation work so well for so long . Today , the thirst for vengeance burns like white fire , more than on any dawn since Pearl Harbor . But in December 1941 , at least , the enemy was known , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know is that America is hated by an enemy who is shadowy , resourceful and fond of grand , bloody symbolism . ... The question is : Will we hate back ? <p> Philadelphia Daily News : <p> REVENGE . Hold on to that thought . Go to bed thinking it . Wake up chanting it . Because nothing less than revenge is called for today . ... We will demand nothing less than a full and deadly response . We have been merciful in the past with the terrorist thugs who have attacked this country . We have condemned them and imposed economic sanctions , but we have not hunted them down with murder in our eyes . Yesterday 's attacks , however , amount to a declaration of war against the United States , a sneak attack even more devastating than the one on Pearl Harbor 50 years ago . At least the Japanese were honorable enough to attack a military target . This time , our enemies went after civilians , among them children . <p> The Daily Oklahoman of Oklahoma City : <p> Time and life go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2001 , ca n't be torn from our memories . Now that we know it can happen here , the whole nation grieves its loss of security . <p> This is what has been shattered : Our sense of immunity from cataclysmic evil . <p> Some will blame God for Tuesday 's events . How could He not protect us from such evil ? ... <p> This is a time for the nation to draw closer to God , a time to pray for the peace of New York City and Washington - as well as the peace of Oklahoma City and Jerusalem and all the places where terrorism has struck fear into the hearts of good people . <p> ( The editorial was adapted from one published April 21 , 1995 , two days after the Murrah Building bombing . ) <p> The Cincinnati Enquirer : <p> Nothing like this has ever happened to our nation before . Pearl Harbor comes close . But in magnitude , the attacks today eclipse even the bombs dropped on our fleet on that historic Day of Infamy in 1941 . <p> There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon . They were our own commercial airliners , apparently loaded with innocent Americans , hijacked and used as horrific weapons against other innocent Americans . <p> Make no mistake . This is war . <p> Buffalo News : <p> Unless the aggressors choose to claim credit , finding out exactly who and why may be difficult . But that task is essential . A moral country can not strike back blindly but it must , in the end , strike back , with all the precision it can manage and all the power that is needed ... <p> But a just retribution may not - at least for a civilized country - involve an equal measure of death and destruction . That may be one of the most painful legacies of the attacks on the World Trade Center in New York , the Pentagon in Washington and the passengers of the airliners that were put to murderous use . If a relatively few men carried out Tuesday 's attacks , and if they represented no identifiable country , how do you weigh the unimaginable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving in to the unthinkable , and launching a counterattack that is equally pitiless , correspondingly depraved ? <p> Grand Forks Herald ( North Dakota ) : <p> There are no Democrats today . There are no Republicans . <p> There are no liberals or conservatives , Easterners or Westerners , blacks or whites , old or young . There are only Americans . And we 're a United States once again ... <p> Today , we 're united in mourning . No Midwesterner is griping good-naturedly about New Yorkers ' " smugness " or Washingtonians ' " arrogance " today . Instead , the response here is summed up by the lines that started forming at local blood banks in the hours after the disaster . <p> Those were n't strangers who were crying out from the rubble , the blood donors knew . They were family - and families go through crises together . <p> Tomorrow , we 'll be united in determination . We Americans may quarrel bitterly over the best uses of our freedom . But when that freedom comes under attack , we respond as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We must protect ourselves , as previous generations have . And if American self-defense brings the displeasure of less resolved nations , such is the way of a harsh world . <p> We must assess which nations truly are friends , which truly are enemies , and engage both accordingly . " It is not just the people who did it , it 's the people who made it possible , " former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger observed yesterday afternoon . Such enemies of America must be made to pay a real price for the horror they have enabled . <p> It has often been noted in recent years that the harshness of real-world events largely has bypassed the current generation of Americans . That we have never really been tested . That peace and economic good times have affected our commitment to defend the freedoms we enjoy . <p> At 5:45 a.m . Arizona time , that peaceful tranquil era passed . <p> The Courier-Post of Cherry Hill , N.J. : <p> The terrorists had their moment of " glory " this morning . They attacked America . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closing of airports , tunnels , bridges and government offices . <p> They shut down America . <p> For a day . For only a day . <p> ... Americans are a steadfast lot . From the very beginning , Americans have met every challenge . They will meet this one , too . ... <p> Today , a nation stood stunned , battered and heartbroken . <p> Tomorrow , a nation begins its quest for justice . <p> The Miami Herald : <p> The attacks exposed a special weakness in America 's national security . As a nation , we spend billions of dollars to ensure that our military defenses are second to none and that we can repel any conventional attack . President Bush wants to spend billions more on a missile-defense shield that would have been useless yesterday . ... <p> Even as the necessary probes begin , the United States first must confront and overcome its shock and horror and then share in the deep sense of communal loss . We then must commit to making this a stronger and safer nation and sparing no expense or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bar of justice . <p> Chicago Tribune : <p> Our carefree moments are over , buried in the gray dust that coated the onlookers on streets of lower Manhattan after the first of the day 's many tragedies . <p> And yet it would be dangerous to succumb in ways that would hearten the terrorists responsible for these acts . ... <p> The fear , like the shock , is abundantly sensible . But not if we as a nation let those be our destinations . That would please those whose cowardice expresses itself in the capture of commercial airliners and the targeting of American landmarks . ... <p> The point here must be justice , the principle that inexactly has guided this country throughout its history . <p> That justice may not be swift . It is important , though , that it be sure . <p> For those who on Tuesday took a part of America 's heart , there must be one uneasy assurance : Life is long . We are not finished . And it is they who must feel the terror . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " President Bush called those responsible . He pledged to find and " punish " them . But the terrorists who attacked New York and Washington are more than cowards , and they require more than punishment . <p> They are enemies . They must be identified , engaged , defeated and put forever out of the terrorism business . America is at war . Where that war will lead , what it will entail , no one knows . Americans should , however , be prepared for a long and perhaps costly struggle . This attack demands an emphatic , sustained response . ... <p> America has been attacked and grievously wounded . It will recover , and it will respond decisively . But it will never be the same . <p> The Hutchinson ( Kan . ) News : <p> Americans have heard the warnings for years : Terrorists carrying chemical , biological or nuclear weapons pose an increasing risk to our national security . <p> We paid scant attention to the warnings before , despite the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing over Scotland in 1988 , executed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trade Center bombing in 1993 , organized by an international terrorist group ; and despite the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 , plotted by a former U.S. soldier angry at his government . <p> Perhaps we dismissed the advice because none of the experts ' worst-case scenarios anticipated Tuesday 's shocking attacks on New York , Washington , D.C. , and , most assuredly , the United States of America . <p> We will pay attention now . ... <p> Reno ( Nev . ) Gazette-Journal : <p> The U.S. was largely shut down Tuesday . The entire air transportation system came to a halt , businesses closed , and Americans were glued to their television sets , radios or computers as the drama unfolded . <p> Within days , we will all be going about our business again . The tragedy will become a local story as New York City deals with the aftermath . ... Our leaders will search for the likely culprits , and undoubtedly someone else elsewhere will also pay a high price as the U.S. exacts its revenge . <p> Then we will move on .
