<p> Despite what they say about hammy actors , you ca n't actually chew the scenery . So even in a place as renowned for its natural setting as the Monterey Peninsula , the question arises : Where are we eating ? <p> Carmel is charming , but often costly and crowded ; Monterey 's Cannery Row seems to aim for the middlebrow ( Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. , anyone ? ) and Pebble Beach 's posh fare will leave 18 holes in your wallet . But in unpretentious Pacific Grove , artful fare in picturesque surroundings is surprisingly affordable . It 's just that few in the Bay Area seem to realize what they 're bypassing on the way to 17-Mile Drive . <p> The secret is slowly starting to get out about Passionfish , a few blocks uphill from scenic Lovers Point Park . Bon Apptit magazine showcased co-owners Cindy and Ted Walter in its January issue , lauding their not-so-secret passion for sustainable seafood . And their retail-priced wine list  --  bucking the industry standard of stiff markups  --  earned a Wine Spectator award last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seasonal , wide-ranging menu . It does n't hurt that main courses top out at $24 , with most under $20 , while sides , " teasers " and first courses are $3 to $10 . <p> But despite Passionfish 's local plaudits and growing national acclaim , we 've always been able to get a same-day reservation ( or , during a big event , by calling the day before ) , usually with a party of up to eight . Two Sundays ago was no different : We called at 3 p.m. , and by 8 p.m. our group of five was seated in the narrow but comfortable , modern dining room . <p> Since three were new to Passionfish , we ordered an array of appetizers that show off its eclectic style : a smoked sturgeon tostadita and Chinese spiced eggplant crostini ( $4 each ) , plus two of that evening 's specials  --  green-lipped mussels in a spicy tomato-flecked broth ( $8 ) and fried asparagus with a black sesame-seed aioli ( $7 ) . <p> The Walters support Monterey Bay Aquarium 's Seafood Watch ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid , as well as " good alternatives " and " best choices . " Hence there 's no bluefin tuna or Chilean sea bass on the menu , which states the principles of sustainable seafood ( neither the ocean floor nor sea turtles should be harmed , for example ) . But the seven entrees " from the water " ( another four are " from the land " ) include excellent substitutes , such as tilapia with thyme mashed potatoes ( $18 ) and wild Monterey salmon over cucumbers , dill and Medjool dates with coriander aioli ( $22 ) . <p> The only let-down in previous visits : the too-crunchy , tangy side of baked penne and Vermont cheddar ( $6 ) . The coconut rice with peanuts ( $3 ) , however , is worth the starch . <p> Passionfish used to be home to El Cocodrilo , a down-home place given to rollicking parties whenever the Monterey Blues Fest was in town . Partners Jefferson Seay and Julio Ramirez , the Nicaraguan-born chef , gave it up in 1996 to focus on Turtle Bay Taqueria , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's moderate prices and merry spirit going across town at their previous joint venture , the Fishwife at Asilomar . <p> With Caribbean and Latin American flavoring , the 21-year-old Fishwife is a little bit of Cancn among the cypresses . It 's often as busy as Seor Frog 's on spring break , but with a far more sedate clientele . Its colorful ceramic and stained-glass fish decor could break through any fog , while its hearty fare ( clam chowder , fisherman 's rice bowls ) with tropical touches ( salsas , black beans with garlic ) should take the chill off after a nearby stroll on Asilomar State Beach 's powder-white sand or around the pristine links at Spanish Bay . <p> Like the Walters , Seay ( now the Fishwife 's sole owner ) endorses Seafood Watch . The Fishwife menu notes that snapper , for example , is served only as a special  --  and only when it 's line-caught and in season , to avoid species depletion . But he makes inventive use of sustainable tilapia , barramundi and domestic mahi mahi . <p> Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; we opt for lighter choices , like the achiote-rubbed tilapia Cancn ( $15.95 ) and crab tostaditas with a cilantro-cashew pesto ( $8.75 ) . For a recent brunch , I enjoyed the grilled wild salmon ( $19.95 ) . Farmed salmon is a Seafood Watch no-no , but wild salmon from California , Oregon or Washington is OK ( and wild Alaskan is best ) . <p> As much as we 've enjoyed Passionfish and the Fishwife over the years , we 've also realized the benefits of casting our line into fresh waters , so to speak . A three-day weekend in April gave us time to try another restaurant under the tourist radar : Max 's Grill , a tranquil dining room just off bustling Lighthouse Avenue . It 's a good spot to wrap up a walking tour of Pacific Grove 's quaint cottages or downtown 's boutiques . <p> French-trained chef Hisayuki " Max " Muramatsu , formerly with Maxim 's of Paris in Tokyo and Anton &; Michel 's in Carmel , prepares French , Japanese and California fusion dishes  --  not to mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , runs the dining room . Highlights included the expertly presented tempura ahi tuna roll ( $7.95 ) , delicate sauteed sand dabs ( $18.95 ) and coconut crme brle ( $5.95 ) . <p> One meal is not enough to add Max 's to our must-do 's for the Monterey Peninsula , but it 's on the must-try-again list . Its 5 p.m. " sunset " dinner bargains ( $14.95 ) are about the only thing that could make us skip watching the real thing from a scenic perch in unheralded Pacific Grove . <p> If you go <p> All locations are in Pacific Grove , about a 2 1/4 - hour drive south of San Francisco via highways 101 and 156 to Highway 1 . <p> Where to stay <p> Asilomar Conference Grounds , 800 Asilomar Ave .
