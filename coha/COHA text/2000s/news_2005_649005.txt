<p> Victor Diaz III waited for the pitch in the small living room of a two-bedroom apartment on the Northwest Side of Chicago . Or at least it seemed he was there . He swung and missed . <p> " C'm on , what are you trying to do ? " Victor Diaz Sr. , silver-haired and stocky , said to his son , the batter , through the 27-inch high-definition television set . He was standing , too nervous to sit . <p> " It 's 1 and 2 , " said Diaz Sr. , who has been his son 's coach since he began playing baseball , who receives a call from him before and after every Mets game , and who watches nearly every game by satellite . " Bat it up the middle . C'm on  --  base hit ! " <p> This was the scene Thursday , when Vicente Padilla of the Philadelphia Phillies was pitching to Victor Diaz at Shea Stadium . Ball two . " Too close to take that , " Diaz Sr. said . " I do n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was a Class AA infielder in the St. Louis Cardinals ' organization in the early 1970 's , was talking about his son . Diaz III was a 23-year-old rookie hitting sensation for the Mets in April , then went into an 0-for-21 slump before smacking a home run Wednesday to break the drought . <p> On this afternoon , Diaz had doubled in his previous at-bat , driving in a run . " He was too hungry to hit when he went into the slump , " his father said . " He 's a young guy . Thinking too much . Too much in front . He 's showing more patience now . " <p> Padilla threw the next pitch . Ball three . " Full count , " Diaz said . Then came the next pitch : " Ball four ! " he shouted , hope mixing with conviction . The umpire motioned strike three . " Oh , Victor , you do n't have to take that pitch ; I 'd be swinging . " <p> Diaz Sr. sat down , looking rather fatigued . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the Mets would send Diaz to the minor leagues now that Mike Cameron was healthy again and ready to claim the job in right field ; Diaz had been holding down the position with surprising success this season . But in the end , they kept him where he is , a reflection of just how highly the Mets think of Diaz , a player being hailed by some as a mini-Manny , meaning that he resembles Boston 's Manny Ramirez in swing and power and country of origin . <p> The comparisons with Ramirez , who was born in the Dominican Republic and grew up in Upper Manhattan , underline just how far Diaz has progressed from the neighborhood in Chicago where he was reared . And in a sense , Diaz was about to come full circle in that journey , heading back to Chicago with his Mets teammates to play a three-game series with the Cubs at Wrigley Field , beginning Monday night . <p> " Man , I tell you , it 's a dream , from where I come from , " Victor Diaz said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's game . " The ' hood ? People do n't amount to much there . They saw me practicing , working hard . They say : ' They ai n't gon na want nobody like you . No way . ' And for a while I got caught up in that mentality . I got caught up in the streets , like my two older brothers  --  they were delinquents . My dad told me , ' You can go straight or you can go the wrong way . ' I listened to my dad . " <p> As he sat in the clubhouse that day , Diaz recalled some of his early years growing up in a primarily Dominican neighborhood in Chicago . His family moved there from Santo Domingo when he was not quite 2 years old . More than 20 years later , he is still rather baby-faced , but with a thick 6-foot , 210-pound body and strong hands , he wields a potent bat . <p> Early in the season , with his average over .350 , with a few home runs next to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his humble No. 8 spot in the batting order , he was asked if he was surprised that he was hitting so well . " I 'm not surprised , " he replied . " I 'm used to hitting .300 . " <p> The response led Omar Minaya , the Mets ' general manager , to say , " And that shows a lot of confidence . " <p> Diaz hit well over .300 as a three-year all-state high school player . " He was a legend as a hitter in the Park District before he got to high school , " said David Bain , who was an assistant baseball coach when Diaz played at Roberto Clemente High School ; he is now the head coach . " As a freshman , he led us to the state championships . In a city semifinal championship game when he was a sophomore , he hit a home run in White Sox park over the center-field fence . " <p> Diaz was 15 at the time and in the city final at Wrigley , Bain said , he tripled off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hitting over .400 . He then led the Gulf Coast Rookie League in hitting ( .354 ) in his first professional season , in 2001 , and led the Class A South Atlantic League in batting ( .351 ) the next season . <p> The Mets acquired him in July 2003 , in a trade that sent Jeromy Burnitz to the Los Angeles Dodgers . He spent the rest of the season at the Mets ' Class AA club in Binghamton , scorching pitchers at a .354 clip . He moved up to Class AAA last year and batted a solid .292 for Norfolk , with 24 homers and 94 runs batted in . He was named the team 's most valuable player . <p> He can hit , it seems clear , and for someone still learning to play the outfield , he is not bad on defense , either . The Mets brought him up at the end of last season and he batted close to .300 . In his most notable at-bat , he hit a dramatic three-run homer off LaTroy Hawkins of the Cubs with two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hometown team then went into a tailspin that cost them the wild-card playoff spot . <p> " I love this kid , " Mets Manager Willie Randolph said , " and he 's growing , learning . He 's got to keep a focus and has to make adjustments . It 's all about adjustments up here . " When Diaz was at Roberto Clemente , he was academically ineligible for the team in his senior year , after receiving an F in woodworking class . " I was young , " he said . " I stopped going to classes . " <p> He seems older enough now ; among other things , he can put his recent slump in perspective . <p> " Hitting so good so early did n't put pressure on me , " he said at Shea . " I mean , who 's going to be hitting .350 for the season  --  Ichiro , Bonds , not many more . But I have to find my groove and stay with it . " <p> " What am I going to prove going back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question the Mets have asked . " I can learn better in the major leagues . I can sit with Mike Piazza and talk hitting . I can get instruction on how the pitchers are thinking from Pedro Martinez . And both have gone out of their way to be helpful . You ca n't get that in the minor leagues . If I do get sent down , it will be frustrating . No two ways about it . But I 'll be back up right away . " <p> Minaya said : " Whatever happens short term , I see Victor as one of the three players who are the core of our future . " The other two , he said , are shortstop Jose Reyes , who is 21 , and third baseman David Wright , who is 22 . Presumably , center fielder Carlos Beltran , who is 28 and has a long-term contract , is part of the core , too . <p> Meanwhile , Diaz continues to learn . He has already made a few silly mistakes , including one in which he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubled off second base on a pop fly . " The guys got on me about that , " he said with a small smile . " Reyes said , ' Hey , do n't be afraid to look at the scoreboard ! ' That will never happen again . " <p> These are the kinds of miscues , of course , for which Ramirez has become famous , and of which Randolph is well aware . " Victor has a fluid swing like Manny , " Randolph said , " but I hope he does n't get compared to Manny for those mental lapses . " <p> Diaz said it was an honor to be compared to Ramirez , miscues or not . They met once , when Diaz was 14 . " I have a cousin who was a minor league pitcher and he was pitching batting practice to the Indians in the White Sox ' park when Manny was with Cleveland , " Diaz said . " My cousin took me into the locker room and I met Manny . He was just huge . My cousin told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ' Come and hurry up to get here . There 's enough money for everybody . " ' <p> Perhaps because Diaz did not play baseball in his senior year , he was not drafted until the 37th round in 2000 , by the Dodgers . His father told him not to sign and urged him to attend Grayson County College , a junior college in Texas . <p> " Do well there and people will see you , " Diaz Sr. told his son . " You will be lonely , it 's a long way from home . But it will be best for you . " <p> And it was . " If I stayed around Chicago , I 'd have stayed in the same environment , " the younger Diaz said . His father moved in with him in Texas , to make sure that all he paid attention to was baseball in the four months he stayed there . <p> At that point , he signed with the Dodgers . Now , five years later , the Mets expect Diaz to be around Flushing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents in the off-season , although he said he was hoping to move his family out of Chicago and into a nearby suburb . For the moment , he and his family are planning a reunion at Wrigley through the middle of the week . <p> " He 's going to be O.K. , " Diaz Sr. said . " He 's the fourth outfielder and he has to play good defense , make the most of opportunities when he 's in the lineup , or pinch-hitting or pinch-running . <p> " We 're satisfied , " he said , then paused . " For this year . " <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com Mets outfielder Victor Diaz has collected plenty of memorabilia for his parents , Victor Sr. and Altagracia .
