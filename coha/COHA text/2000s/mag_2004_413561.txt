CARMEN SAYS ... " I love Popsicles . I can remember as a kid it would be so hot that I could never get enough of them . But a snow cone , well , I think they 're overrated . They always look better than they really are . They just do n't deliver like a Popsicle . " CARMEN SAYS ... " I like a guy who takes care of himself . A manicure is nice , and always , always take care of the feet . " THE SUN SHOOTS HUGE COLUMNS OF LIGHT across the room , directly into the eyes of Carmen Electra , and I am trying hard to get a look them . We are knee to knee , on the floor , superclose . Our heads are almost touching . These are the warm , electric minutes before twilight in L. A. Her husband will be back from work soon . I want her to look into my eyes , too , to stare right back at me , but she wo n't . " Go , " she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , holding one finger on top of the pile and looking over the board . I am doing well . It must be ... BY TOM CHIARELLA/PHOTOGRAPHS BY JAMES WHITE annoying to have me slow-play a game of Sorry ! , but I am kicking Carmen Electra 's ass . I 'm doing my best not to rub it in . " Go , go , go , " she says . My next card says 4 . Move backward 4 . She humphs , glad to see my luck turn , before taking a card . In Sorry ! , I 've told her , there is always hope . She 's been concentrating as we play , but sometimes we pause so I can ask her about the various epochs in her much-traveled life . Every time she appears on television-as Prince 's pop prodigy , as a bouncing Baywatch lifeguard , as ( briefly ) Dennis Rodman 's wife , and more recently with husband Dave Navarro on " Til Death Do Us Part-it seems to be a completely new incarnation . Not exactly model , not exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm more of a personality , " she gladly admits , as if that were as normal as a nickel . " That 's what I wanted . I wanted to create this image . Of course , I evolve from year to year . But I take responsibility for " - she suddenly shoots her arm out , palm up , card in hand- " for this ! " " Twelve ! " she says , sliding her pawn urgently forward , tight to the board so there is an audible smooth hiss , and finishing on a space formerly occupied by me . She nods with satisfaction as she flicks my piece off the board , flourishing the move with her very own sound effect . " Sha-donk ! " she says , laughing . Sha-donk ? She squints and points her tiny finger at me , jabbing it lightly in my arm . " Pe-tat-tat ! You know . Bam ! I got you . " I look down at the board . She drums her fingernails on the coffee table and leans closer . She 's slowed my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pawns home and another close . " I got you , " I say . " I 'm still good here . " She reaches across the table for a piece of sashimi as I pull a card . She 's wearing a jean jacket over a sleeveless top , even though it 's plenty warm . She 's got on three-inch heels , even though we 're sitting on the floor . I ca n't tell if she does n't know how to relax or if she just got too caught up in the game to change . Or maybe I just give her the creeps . But she is warm and alive and right next to me , her tiny hand pressed to the floor next to my knee . I brought the board game . It was my idea . I did n't realize it would be this physical . I 'm an idiot . At this late juncture , I realize I could have brought Twister . She dips the slice of salmon in the spicy mayonnaise and slips it between her lips delicately . As she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hand . Whachagot ? Then I remember to look at my card : 3 . Move forward 3 . " Sha-donk that , " I say . She squints and shakes her head . " You only go sha-donk when you do something , something real , when you 're really hurting the other guy . " She flips a card : 7 . Move forward 7 or split the move between two pawns . She looks over the board and smiles , her most heartfelt smile yet , the face of a woman who ca n't help but feel good . " Like this , " she says , clipping off four moves to trash another of my pawns , then moving another three spaces to land on the yellow triangle that lets her slide four more spaces for free . " That , " she says , " is a sha-donk . " I flip over my next card , another pedestrian 3 . " You have to make up your own sounds , " Carmen explains . " You have to have your own language for how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card , presses another pawn closer to home . I can see that I am suddenly doomed . In two swift moves , Carmen Electra has stolen the game . She runs her hands through her hair and shakes it out . " Come on , " she says . " Play . " I reach for my own piece of sushi . The hell with her . " Do n't worry , Electra . I 'll beat you . I 'll sha-donk you all night long . " She snorts . Preposterous . She taps the board , hurrying me to my demise . That 's when I want to pause , to remind her what I told her earlier , that no matter what , there is always hope . Sidebar CARMEN SAYS ... " The best summer date is n't the beach . The sand gets everywhere . There 's no may to really get comfortable . I 'd rather go to Magic Mountain . Besides , I 'm not all that good a sujirnmer. " // <p>           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
