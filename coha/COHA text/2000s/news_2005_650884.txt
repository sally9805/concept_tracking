<p> Let me offer two statements about this paper 's coverage of the conflict in the Middle East . First : I find the correspondents at The Times to be honest and committed journalists . Second : The Times today is the gold standard as far as setting out in precise language the perspectives of the parties , the contents of resolutions , the terms of international conventions . <p> Neither of these comments is my own . The first is a direct quotation from Michael F. Brown , executive director of Partners for Peace , an organization that seeks , it says , " to end the occupation of the Palestinian territories . " The second comes from Andrea Levin , president and executive director of the Committee for Accurate Middle East Reporting in America , the muscular pro-Zionist media monitor . With partisans on each side offering respectful appraisal in place of vituperation and threat , you would think that we had reached a milestone moment in The Times 's coverage of the Israel-Palestine conflict . <p> You would be wrong . Less temperate groups on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outright dishonesty to complicity in the deaths of civilians . A group called the Orthodox Caucus has led boycotts of The Times for " simply not telling the truth . " I have met with representatives of If Americans Knew , an organization that says The Times conscientiously reports on the deaths of Israeli children but ignores the deaths of Palestinian children  --  children , they say , usually " shot in the head or chest " by the Israeli soldiers . <p> On the edges , rage and accusation prevail ; nearer the middle , more reasoned critics still find much to criticize . Michael Brown and Andrea Levin can cite chapter , verse , sentence and punctuation mark . They watch this paper with a truly awesome vigilance . <p> It 's this simple : An article about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can not appear in The Times without eliciting instant and intense response . A photograph of a grieving mother is considered a provocation , an interview with a radical on either side is deemed willful propaganda . Detailed studies of column inches devoted to one or another subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Md. , has written to me 164 times ( as of Friday ) over the past 17 months to comment on the Middle East coverage . His messages are seldom love letters . <p> On this issue , love letters are as common as compromise , and The Times 's exoneration from charges of bias is as likely as an imminent peace . <p> After reading thousands of criticisms ( as well as insults , accusations and threats ) of The Times 's Middle East coverage , I 'm still waiting for one reader to say the paper has ever been unfair in a way that was damaging to both sides . Given the frequency of articles on the subject , it would be hard to imagine that such a piece has not been published . In fact , I 've seen a few myself . But to see them , I have had to suppress my own feelings about what is happening in Israel and Palestine . <p> I ca n't say I 'm very good at it . How could I be  --  how could anyone be  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so riddled with pain ? Who can be dispassionate about an endless tragedy ? <p> This does n't exonerate The Times , nor does the fact that criticism comes from each side suggest that the paper 's doing something right . But no one who tries to walk down the middle of a road during a firefight could possibly emerge unscathed . <p> Critics will say The Times attempts nothing of the sort , that it has thrown in its lot with one side in the conflict . But let 's keep motive out of this discussion . Neither you nor I know what the motives of the editors might be . Nor should their motives even matter . We can judge them only on what they do . <p> Some things The Times does and does not do ( apart from having extremely opinionated opinion pages , which color the way the rest of the paper is read but are not the issue under discussion today ) : <p> It does not provide history lessons . A report on an assassination attempt on a Hamas leader in Gaza that kills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps a Palestinian attack on an Israeli settlement . But , says the angered reader , what about the murderous assault that provoked the settlement attack ? And , says his aggrieved counterpart on the other side , what about the ambush that preceded the assault ? And so on back to the first intifada , and then to 1973 and 1967 and 1956 and 1948  --  an endless chain of regression and recrimination and pain that can not be represented in a year , much less in a single dispatch in a single day . <p> It eschews passion . If your cause needs good publicity  --  as both the Palestinians and the Israelis definitely do  --  conventional news story tropes can only be infuriating : bland recitations of presumed facts followed by challenges to those facts , assertions by spokesmen instantly countered by opposing spokesmen . The paper 's seeming reluctance , for instance , to report evidence of incitement to racial or religious hatred derives in part , I believe , from a subconscious effort to stick to the noninflammatory middle and to keep things civil , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But partisans desire heat . Detachment itself becomes suspect . If you are not with us , you are therefore against us . <p> It makes selections . For people on either side who see the conflict as a life-and-death issue  --  as it certainly is  --  the Middle East is the only story that matters . Each day 's reports in The Times are tiny fragments of a tragic epic . Yes , there were demonstrations against settler relocation this morning , but how can you ignore the afternoon 's additional construction on the West Bank barrier ? Or , I know you gave my version of events yesterday , but why are you presenting only the other side 's version today ? <p> This dilemma is aggravated by the way certain events force themselves into the newspaper . Violence trumps virtually everything else . If you are covering a debate and a terror bomb detonates two blocks away , you race to the bombing site . Terrorists have a horrifying way of influencing news coverage , but it works . <p> It does not cede definitive authority to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on Its Own , Reshaping West Bank Borders , " by Steven Erlanger , angered Michael Brown for its unelaborated statement that Palestinians " argue that all Israeli settlements beyond the green line are illegal . " The Times , Brown believes , is obligated to note that " it 's not just the Palestinians who say it 's illegal , but U.N . Security Council resolutions . " <p> Ethan Bronner , the paper 's deputy foreign editor , counters : " We view ourselves as neutral and unbound by such judgments . We cite them , but we do not live by them . " He adds , " In 1975 , when the U.N . General Assembly labeled Zionism as racism , would it have been logical for The Times to repeat that description as fact from then on ? Obviously not . We take note of official views , but we do n't adopt them as our own . " <p> Nor does the paper accept as authoritative the reporting of others . A common criticism I receive is built around " proof " of something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is drawn from openly partisan sources , and when I cite to critics contrary evidence provided by Times reporters , that evidence is in turn dismissed as partisan . The representatives of If Americans Knew earnestly believe that the information they presented to me about the killing of Palestinian children to be " simple objective criteria . " But I do n't think any of us can be objective about our own claimed objectivity . <p> It is limited by geography . The Times , like virtually every American news organization , maintains its bureau in West Jerusalem . Its reporters and their families shop in the same markets , walk the same streets and sit in the same cafes that have long been at risk of terrorist attack . Some advocates of the Palestinian cause call this " structural geographic bias . " <p> If the reporters lived in Gaza or Ramallah , this argument goes , they would feel exposed to the daily struggles and dangers of life behind Palestinian lines and would presumably become more empathetic toward the Palestinians . <p> I do n't know about empathy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you see . A reporter based in secular , Europeanized Tel Aviv would experience an Israel vastly different from one living in Jerusalem ; a reporter with a home in Ramallah would most likely find an entirely different world . The Times ought to give it a try . <p> It 's only a newspaper . It eventually comes to this : Journalism itself is inadequate to tell this story . Like recorded music , which is only a facsimile of music , journalism is a substitute , a stand-in . It 's what we call on when we ca n't know something firsthand . It 's not reality , but a version of reality , and both daily deadlines and limited space make even the best journalism a reductionist version of reality . <p> In preparing to write this article , my conversations with Michael Brown and Andrea Levin , with various other parties of interest and with The Times 's editors consumed hours . My e-mail encounters with readers have consumed months . To all who would assert that squeezing what I 've drawn from this research into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuance or robbed them of their power , I have no rebuttal . The more important and complicated an issue , or the closer it is to the edge of life and death and the future of nations , the less likely its essences can be distilled by that wholly inadequate but absolutely necessary servant , daily journalism . <p> A postscript : <p> During my research , representatives of If Americans Knew expressed the belief that unless the paper assigned equal numbers of Muslim and Jewish reporters to cover the conflict , Jewish reporters should be kept off the beat . <p> I find this profoundly offensive , but not nearly as repellent as a calumny that has popped up in my e-mail with lamentable frequency  --  the charge that The Times is anti-Semitic . Even if you stipulate that The Times 's reporters and editors favor the Palestinian cause ( something I am not remotely prepared to do ) , this is an astonishing debasement . If reporting that is sympathetic to Palestinians , or antipathetic to Israelis , is anti-Semitism , what is real anti-Semitism ? What word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatred , or acts of intentional , ethnically motivated violence ? <p> The Times may be  --  is  --  imperfect . It is not anti-Semitic . Calling it that defames the accuser far more than it does the accused . <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com
