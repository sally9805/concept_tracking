" Sweet Land of Liberty " // And this will be the day  --  this will be the day when all of God ? s children will be able to sing with new meaning : // My country ? t is of thee , sweet land of liberty , of thee I sing . // Land where my fathers died , land of the Pilgrim ? s pride , // From every mountainside , let freedom ring ! // And if America is to be a great nation , this must become true . // And so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire . // Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York . // Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania . // Let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado . // Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California . // But not only that : // Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia . // Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee . // Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring . // As the Reverend Martin Luther King , Jr. , brought his speech at the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom to a thundering close , Anna Arnold Hedgeman sat a few feet away . It was a long-overdue moment of recognition for the sixty-four-year-old civil rights activist , though it was bittersweet . The only woman on the steering committee for the march , Hedgeman had a place of honor on the dais at the base of the Lincoln Memorial . It was only at the last minute , at her insistence , that march organizers gave a few minutes on the program to Little Rock leader Daisy Bates and " casually " introduced Rosa Parks to the crowd . Hedgeman remained unacknowledged , her presence mute testimony to the importance of decades of grassroots organizing , much of it in the North , that had brought a quarter of a million people to the greatest demonstration in the nation ? s history . It is safe to say that most of the marchers gathered that hot August afternoon had no idea who she was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger and more militant , Hedgeman was part of a largely forgotten generation of activists , women and men , black and white , religious and secular , whose lives embodied the long history of civil rights in the North . // Anna Arnold Hedgeman ? s journey began in the small-town Midwest at the dawn of the twentieth century , took her through the North , and brought her into the heart of a remarkable and diverse political and social movement to challenge racial inequality in America . She came of age as millions of blacks headed north in search of opportunity but faced a regime of racial proscription there that was every bit as deeply entrenched as the southern system of Jim Crow . During her lifetime of activism , she encountered grassroots school desegregation activists and angry Klansmen ; black and white churchwomen committed to dialogue on race relations ; poor black migrants and struggling women workers ; hypocritical white liberals who mouthed their commitment to racial equality but continued to profit from it ; musicians , activists , and intellectuals who created the Harlem Renaissance ; black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activists committed to building an interracial labor movement . A tireless woman of political savvy and considerable charm , she worked with nearly every important civil rights activist in the first half of the twentieth century . // Hedgeman started life born into the " talented tenth , " a term coined by W. E. B. DuBois for the highly educated , deeply religious , and well-connected black men and women who saw their mission as uplifting the race . Pious and proper , she was the embodiment of the black churchwoman , sometimes prone to self-righteousness but deeply committed to leading a life of faith in service of social change . For Hedgeman , as it was for many early-twentieth-century black activists , there was no boundary between politics and piety , between prayer and protest . Her calling was both spiritual and practical but also open to the dramatically changing circumstances of America as it was remade by the massive black diaspora . Hedgeman ? s encounter with the troubled and unresolved history of race and inequality in the North profoundly altered her vocation . She found herself drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the black women born in circumstances far less fortunate than her own . Even if she never jettisoned her intense religiosity or her sense of propriety , she came to see that the project of uplifting the poor into bourgeois respectability by prayer , admonition , or moral education would never be sufficient . Because of her encounter with racial and economic injustice , she came to argue that the plight of the black poor would be overcome only through a wholescale political and economic transformation . // Anna Arnold ? s childhood was anything but ordinary . She grew up in a nearly all-white world . Born in Marshalltown , Iowa , in 1899 and raised in Anoka , Minnesota , in a devout household , she was the daughter of a college-educated southern migrant so light-skinned that he could pass for white . William Arnold was a preacher and educator committed to the prohibition of alcohol . A stern , devout man , he had high ambitions for his children . When Anna was still an infant , the Arnolds found their way to Anoka , a relatively prosperous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mississippi River , twenty miles northwest of Minneapolis . Only 8,809 blacks lived in the entire state in 1920 . Anoka ? s tiny black population had risen from only 15 to 41 in the first two decades of the twentieth century . The only blacks Arnold knew for most of her childhood were immediate family members . Minnesota was relatively liberal , its white population more indifferent than hostile to the small number of blacks who peppered the state . Anna Arnold did not recall facing any racial hostility as a child , but it did affect others . In 1931 , less than ten years after she left her hometown , a black Anokan barely escaped a lynch mob . // Comfortable as the only black person in a room full of whites , she became the first black student at Hamline University , a small Methodist school in St. Paul . It was there , in Minnesota ? s capital , where racial tensions were soaring , that she had her first serious encounters with other African Americans . Several thousand blacks had moved into the Twin Cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racial restrictions in schools , housing , and employment . One member of Arnold ? s social circle in St. Paul was Roy Wilkins , two years her junior and later president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People . Fresh from college , Wilkins wrote a scathing account of their home state , decrying the " complacency " and " indifference " of its black leadership . " The most regrettable and almost tragic feature of life in Minnesota , " wrote Wilkins , " is that Negroes are so satisfied with their condition that they are blind to the signs of a new time . " // In the 1920s , blacks faced growing hostility in the North . Throughout the region , restrictive covenants  --  clauses in home deeds that forbade blacks and other minorities from purchasing or renting homes  --  proliferated . Nearly every new housing development built during the booming 1920s was closed to blacks . Those who attempted to breach the invisible color lines that separated neighborhoods faced violent reprisals . The result was a steep rise in housing segregation . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 1920s . Chicago ? s Klan , for example , had nearly forty thousand members , and nearly one in three white men in Indiana belonged to the group at its peak in the mid-1920s . In Detroit , a Klansman lost election to the Detroit mayoralty on a technicality in 1924 . Blacks faced growing restrictions . Shopkeepers , restaurant owners , and theater managers proclaimed their premises for whites only . And racially separate schools proliferated , particularly in northern towns that attracted large numbers of black migrants . Nearly all of these proscriptions  --  as Wilkins called them  --  were defended by law enforcement authorities . // Anna Arnold had her first serious encounter with discrimination as a twenty-two-year-old . An ambitious student , she pursued one of the few professions open to educated black women  --  teaching . But St. Paul had a very small black population , and its school district had no interest in placing a " colored " teacher in one of its white schools . ( With few exceptions , hardly any black teachers taught white students in the North until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see the larger world , she took a teaching job at Rust College in Holly Springs , Mississippi , a small , all-black " citadel of moralistic Methodism . " The students at Rust were , for the most part , poorly educated ; the school had a small budget ; and Holly Springs could not have been more different from Anoka or St. Paul . Arnold found the indignities of southern-style Jim Crow difficult to negotiate , though she learned a great deal about the history of race relations from her mentor , Rust College dean J. Leonard Farmer , whose son James would later move north and spearhead the Congress of Racial Equality . Embittered by the " overwhelming difficulties " of life in the segregated South , she headed back north after two years , feeling a " deep hate " toward southern whites . // In 1924 , Anna Arnold was hired by the YWCA , starting out in Springfield , Ohio . The town was hardly a refuge from the indignities that she had experienced in the South , but the Y provided a springboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fundamentalist revival of the 1920s , the Y attracted young , idealistic , churchgoing women who used their talents to reform and uplift poor and working-class women through continuing education , moral training , cultural events , and physical fitness programs . By the 1920s , the YWCA movement was also tentatively interracial , drawing together churchwomen who began to experiment with " interracial dialogues . " One of the few white-dominated institutions that hired black women to positions of leadership , the Y became the base for a whole generation of ambitious black social workers , educators , and administrators . Building on a Christian understanding of the " brotherhood of all mankind , " the Y ? s moral integrationists worked within churches and religious organizations toward the goal of interracial cooperation . It was a daunting challenge when , as the old adage went , Sunday services were the most segregated hour in America . Most whites listened to white ministers , imagined Jesus as white , and could scarcely envision a heaven without segregation . Religious interracialists had modest goals : to foster " tolerance " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presence of " the Negro problem " in their midst , and to create spaces for interracial dialogue through what one skeptical observer called " tea , touch , and talk . " To white interracialists , the very prospect of attending conferences with blacks was heady . And to black interracialists , especially those who aspired to respectability , interracial meetings were a rare opening to a white world mostly forbidden to them . // When Arnold started with the Y , it was part of a still-tentative religious interracialist movement . Beginning in the 1920s , the Federal Council of Churches , an umbrella organization of mainline Protestant denominations , created a Department of Racial and Cultural Relations . Through the mid-1960s , it published a bimonthly newsletter , the Interracial News Service , and sponsored " Race Relations Sunday , " an annual event in which pastors were encouraged to bring up questions of racial inequality in sermons or , for the less adventuresome , in church newsletters or afternoon seminars . However symbolic such efforts were , they attracted a dedicated cadre of activists , committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of racial inequality as a moral problem . Their vision of " brotherhood , " that all were equal in the eyes of Christ , would lead a small but growing number of whites to embrace the goals of the fledgling struggle for black equality . // Protestant interracialism , especially in the Y , drew much of its vision from the missionary movement . Missionaries were often agents of American imperialism , men and women who dedicated their lives to bringing civilization and Christianity to the unchurched , uneducated , and undemocratic peoples of the world . As the United States extended its political , military , and economic reach abroad in the early twentieth century , missionaries were often on the front lines . However , overseas mission work had unintended consequences . By the 1920s , many returning missionaries , particularly white women , had been transformed by their encounter with foreign people of color . Though most were incapable of wholly jettisoning their sense of moral and political superiority , many returned from these stints humbled by their experiences and outraged at the suffering , deprivation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vocal , and growing segment of churchwomen began to compare the situation of American blacks to that of the oppressed peoples overseas . Haltingly , they began to demand that their own churches extend their mission work to Negroes  --  and , even more important , they began to argue for the full recognition of blacks within their own churches . By the late 1920s , they began to push even further , forging alliances with like-minded black churchwomen. // The Y movement was influenced by similar interracial currents , but like most institutions in the early twentieth century  --  even the most progressive  --  YMCAs and YWCAs were still strictly segregated by race . Any self-respecting northern city had its " White-WCA " and , if its black population was large enough , its Negro Y , a place that provided social services , housing and food , and education for urban blacks . The Negro Y was one of the most visible manifestations of a politics of respectability and race uplift that had infused black politics since the late nineteenth century . In this vision of social reform , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new vision of " the race , " one that challenged prevailing white assumptions about innate black inferiority . Well-to-do blacks emphasized the importance of propriety , embracing a set of Victorian values of decorum , restraint , and caution that distanced them from the black masses , whose dress was garish ; music profane ; religion overly emotional ; accents backward and folkish ; and habits feckless and irresponsible . Respectability required abstinence from the pleasures of the flesh , a proper and restrained religion , and conservative dress . The politics of uplift was deeply condescending , but also hopeful that the poor and working classes could be redeemed through the charitable efforts and good example of their betters. // Black women such as Arnold played a special role in the politics of uplift and respectability . Since the late nineteenth century , black women had created an extraordinary base of sororities and clubs . At lunches and teas , they gathered to socialize and to build lasting networks of friendship . As much as clubwomen liked to don their fine dresses , hats , and gloves , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of responsibility toward their disadvantaged sisters . As " race women , " they had a twofold duty : first , to embody the very virtues that whites believed were inherently lacking in black culture , and , second , to instill those virtues in the downtrodden . Through their moral example , but also through reform institutions , churches , and schools , black women hoped to modify the behavior and values of the poor and thus undermine the racial stereotypes that prevented the full recognition of Negroes as citizens . To be sure , early-twentieth-century black elites had no monopoly on the ideology of uplift . Progressive-era reformers  --  black and white alike  --  condescended toward the poor and created a bevy of institutions to control and discipline the ill-behaved , the " uncultured , " and the unruly . But because of the deep currents of racial oppression , blacks viewed uplift as a distinct task to be performed by blacks themselves . At the very core of the politics of uplift was a belief in racial solidarity and self-help . It was up to Negroes to pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
