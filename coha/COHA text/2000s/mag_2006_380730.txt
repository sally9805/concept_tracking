At the start of 2005 , Bill Frist seemed to have the political Midas touch . A successful surgeon , the Tennessee Republican had blossomed in his second career , rising from his election to the U.S. Senate in 1994 to the post of majority leader in 2002 . But last year , while Frist tried to both manage an unwieldy Senate and prepare for a 2008 presidential run , he often sounded off-balance  --  as when he inserted himself into the Terri Schiavo controversy , boldly but mistakenly arguing that her doctors misdiagnosed her vegetative state . <P> Frist will again find himself at the center of an emotional issue this week as the Senate debates illegal-immigration policy , and his performance could show whether he has regained his political footing . His party is divided : some G.O.P.ers simply want tougher border enforcement , while others , including President Bush , want temporary work permits for illegal immigrants . In December , the House sided with the hard-liners , passing a bill with no such guest-worker program and with provisions that would make it a federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Hillary Clinton , a possible 2008 contender on the other side of the aisle , slammed the bill , saying it " would literally criminalize the Good Samaritan and probably even Jesus himself . " In rallies from Milwaukee , Wis. , to Los Angeles , thousands of people marched last week to protest the proposed crackdown on illegal immigrants . <P> So with whom has Frist sided ? None of the above . To the annoyance of some G.O.P. colleagues , who were crafting their own bill , Frist put out his plan , which would increase penalties for people in the U.S. illegally and add funding for guarding the border but not give work permits to illegal immigrants already here . While he has left open the possibility of backing a bill that includes a guest-worker provision , he 's determined to get stronger border enforcement passed , which will please conservative voters who will pick the G.O.P. nominee in 2008 . David Winston , a veteran G.O.P. pollster , says that Frist  --  who plans to retire from the Senate after this year  --  " is clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in passing an immigration bill  --  especially his own  --  he may regain some of the luster he lost last year . If he ca n't , he may return home to Tennessee as the ineffectual G.O.P. leader who lost his touch  --  and his presidential prospects .
