He had jumped a radio tower and a cliff in Norway , but never a bridge . He chose a Wednesday morning when the fog was expected to burn off early and called in sick to work . At dawn , he climbed the tower . The riskiest part , he thought , would be landing in the water , where his friends would be waiting with a boat . <p> While he fell he counted to three and pushed it to four though he 'd promised he would n't , and his canopy opened without any trouble , exactly as it should . But a freak wind came and lofted him-he did n't remember this , but it must have happened-and now his chute was snared in the steel ropes of the bridge , and he was dangling like a hurt insect a hundred feet above the morning traffic . His right arm had snapped inside its Gore-Tex sleeve , and though he wanted to tuck it close to his body , he could n't . He could n't reach his radio , either . He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glittered in the sun as they streamed toward the city , the very edge of the continent . It was stupid to have jumped so close to rush hour . <p> Now , because of him , more than eighty thousand people would be late to work . Across the city , deadlines would be missed , meetings cancelled , stores understaffed . The host of the nine o'clock show on KQED would not arrive in time ; at every major hospital , surgeries would be postponed . The driver of the Nissan Altima stalled near the end of the Yerba Buena tunnel would be late , and so would the woman beside him . The girl in the back seat did not have a job . School had already started , but that was behind her , before the bridge . She had never planned to go . <p> Ian tapped the steering wheel and stared hopefully at the tunnel 's bright mouth . Usually , when you came out from under the manmade island , the traffic sped up until it hit land and clogged again . The pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 880 loop at the right time , you could slip straight into the carpool lane and not stop until the toll plaza . That 's why it was worth it to pull off the freeway in Oakland to pick up passengers-you saved the two-dollar toll and at least twenty minutes . It always struck Ian as odd , the idea of ferrying strangers across the bridge . He could n't help feeling responsible for their safety and comfort . He limited the mess in the car to the floor behind his own seat and drove more cautiously than he did when he was alone . Until Oakland , he listened to the symphonies and concertos that bored his wife , and sometimes the outdated pop music that embarrassed her , but after Oakland he turned the volume down and switched to news , the least political of the stations , with weather and traffic repeated every fifteen minutes . <p> He stole a look at his front-seat passenger , her dark head bent over a stack of papers . She 'd unhitched her seat belt when they reached the bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long enough to remember the earthquake in ' 89 , to prefer the risk of a car accident to the risk of being trapped under rubble . <p> The girl in the back had never put hers on . She could n't sit still , kept shifting her limbs about , running her nails back and forth along the beige velour edge of her seat , leaning her head against the window and clouding up the glass . She 'd rather be on the train , hurtling under the Bay , unstoppable . But the train was expensive , the car pool was free , and though her parents had money , plenty of it , she did n't have any of her own . Their money came weighed down with rules and obligations that Julia , a month and a half before her sixteenth birthday , did not want or need . <p> The first couple of times she 'd ridden the car pool into the city , she 'd felt a little thrill of danger as she waited in the parking lot under the overpass for the first car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she knew . It was like hitchhiking , only more organized . The drivers were usually men in luxury cars , who could afford parking in the city , who draped their suit jackets over one back-seat window , obscuring the view , but Julia was n't nave-she knew that they could be rapists or murderers , too . Even this guy , who looked so ordinary , so suburban , so nice , could stop the car at any minute and put a knife to her throat . The fact that two random passengers rode in each car helped ; it meant that there was a chance they could work together to overpower the driver if he turned on them , although the woman in the front could be his accomplice-they could have planned it so that she 'd wait in line behind Julia , and maybe she 'd be the one to pull the knife . Except they were stuck in traffic inside a tunnel , trapped in the middle of five lanes , where you could n't pull over to go to the bathroom or change a blown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened to the weather report for the third time . It had n't changed-outside the tunnel the sky remained an immaculate blue , and the temperature was still sixty-four degrees . Nothing interesting was going to happen . <p> " It 's bad today , " the driver said . <p> Hannah looked up from the papers in her lap . " What is ? " she said . <p> " The traffic . We 've hardly moved in ten minutes . " <p> When she 'd moved to Oakland for Kate and started commuting across the Bay , something she 'd always said she 'd never do , Hannah had been relieved to discover that the casual car pool was not casual at all , but a complex and predictable system which operated under its own code of etiquette . You had to get into the first car that arrived , no picking and choosing , although women could skip pickup trucks and two-seater convertibles in which they 'd have to ride alone with a man . The first person in line always took the back seat , unless he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only acceptable topics of conversation , after Good morning and before Thank you , have a good day , and passengers were expected never to speak unless the driver spoke first . No one ever explained the rules , but they were so clear and universally accepted that you figured them out yourself the first day you took the car pool . Hannah had only witnessed someone break the code once , a middle-aged white woman driving a Volvo station wagon with a " Free Tibet " sticker on its rear bumper . There 'd been a news item on NPR about a black kid beaten to death by the police , and she 'd started apologizing to the suited , briefcased black man in the front seat . In back , Hannah had cringed , but she had n't said anything . Later , she wished she had . <p> She looked at the blue-lit clock on the dashboard . Seven thirtyeight . She 'd been running late all morning , in a foul mood , snapping at Kate for hitting the snooze button one more time than Hannah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but on her way out she 'd discovered in yesterday 's unchecked mail the thick manila envelope that might change everything . She should have taken the envelope back into the apartment as a peace offering , should have wanted to open it with Kate-it was addressed to both of them-but instead , she brought it with her , leaving the rest of the mail for Kate to find when she finally left for work . <p> Reading in cars made Hannah feel sick to her stomach , especially in traffic . It helped to train her eyes on the horizon or on anything far enough away that it did n't appear to move , but today she could n't resist the packet in her lap . Luckily the driver shifted gears and changed lanes smoothly and only when necessary . As soon as he 'd merged safely onto the freeway Hannah slid her nail under the envelope 's seal and drew out a stack of papers , each two sheets , stapled , letterheaded The Bay Area Cryogenic Center , containing a brief description-not only physical but biographical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had agreed , in advance and for reasons of his own , to become the father of her child . <p> Only it was n't going to be her child , not only hers , but hers and Kate 's . Which meant that this preview , this flipping through profiles in a stranger 's car , felt like a small betrayal . <p> Ian squinted at the headlights reflected in his rearview mirror , trying to determine if the car behind him remained at a reasonable distance , or if it had crept closer , the way he 'd eased off his own brake to shorten the gap between his car and the one in front . He knew it was pointless , this edging forward , but he could not help feeling anxious to get out of the tunnel . If he was going to sit in traffic , he wanted a view : the silver lip of the city , the roll of fog cushioning the Golden Gate . He thought about how the prisoners on Alcatraz used to hear the boisterous city at night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far away . He checked his mirror again , and this time saw not the river of lights but the girl , the one in back , with her arm bent at an awkward angle , shoulders bare , T-shirt noosed around her neck . He glanced at the car in front , then at the woman beside him . She was oblivious , still completely absorbed in whatever she was reading . <p> " Is it warm back there ? " Ian asked . " I can turn the air on if you want . " Ian never turned the air on . He liked to feel the climate change as he drove to work . Most days , the temperature dropped ten degrees between home and Oakland , and another ten as he crossed the Bay . <p> " It 's fine , " Julia said . She was an expert at changing her clothes without revealing anything more than her shoulders and a couple of inches of belly , parts that other girls showed off all the time . She 'd spent a long time choosing the T-shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of a band she 'd never heard play , slightly ripped along one seam . She envied people who lived casually , who did not need to try as hard as she did to pick out the right T-shirt , or to think of the right things to say . She snapped a studded leather bracelet around a wrist , extracted a hook of silver from a tiny Ziploc bag and threaded it through the nearly imperceptible hole in her nose . Watching in the rearview mirror , Ian thought she looked as though she were dressing for work , or for a performance , and in a sense she was . If she made it off the bridge alive , if she did not die of boredom first , Julia would take the streetcar to the Castro , where she would sit on the gum-splotched sidewalk outside the Ben &; Jerry 's next to Isaac , a fourteen-year-old runaway Mormon from the shore of the Great Salt Lake . She would put a coffee cup in front of her , a few coins in the bottom for seed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change . Sweetie , Isaac 's half-grown pit bull , was good for protection but discouraged donations , while Julia , with her wispy blond hair and new-to-the-streets fragility , elicited sympathy and dollar bills from the older women and straight men who were immune to Isaac 's charms . It made no sense that passersby rewarded cleanliness among panhandlers , but they did . Julia bought Diet Cokes with the money she earned , and cookie-dough ice cream cones for both of them , but at the end of the day she turned what was left of her takings over to Isaac before boarding the F Market to the Embarcadero and then the bus back across the bridge . <p> Later , lying awake in the pink room she 'd slept in since she was small , she thought about Isaac . They did n't allow dogs at the shelters , so he either camped in the park with the other street kids , or he let someone buy him a sandwich and take him somewhere where afterwards , if he was lucky , he might be able to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him home with her , but she could n't ; her parents , though they donated to several charities and dropped loose coins into Styrofoam cups more often than not , would never open their guest room to a runaway kid and his dog , no matter how sweet and desperate they looked , no matter how much Julia pleaded . <p> She 'd met Isaac in the summer , when she started riding the car pool into the city to escape the boredom that hung over the East Bay like smog . Julia had no friends . She used to have a friend , her best and only friend , Serena . Serena was the kind of girl who liked to keep only one friend at a time , and for almost two years she adored Julia . Her attention was bright and uncomfortable and hard to resist . They spent nearly all their time together . Whenever Julia spoke to anyone else , or mentioned another girl 's name , or , worse , a boy 's , unless it was in a mean way , Serena acted possessive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spring of their freshman year , she replaced Julia . She found a new best friend who 'd just moved to Oakland from Florida , who needed her more than Julia did and who would do whatever she asked . Almost overnight , and with no explanation , Serena stopped talking to Julia entirely . It was too late in the school year to make new friends . Everyone was organized already , into twos and threes and bigger groups ; it did n't matter . No one , not even the outcasts , would make room for Julia . <p> She wanted to get a summer job , but her mother would n't let her . She said she wanted Julia to enjoy herself , to do whatever she pleased , within reason . In the future there would be jobs and SAT prep classes and trips to Europe . This might be the last summer she could be completely free . <p> " You used to have such fun at the pool with Serena , " her mother said . <p> " I hate Serena , " Julia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to camp . Julia hated camp . She hated even the idea of camp . She refused to go . She went to the pool once by herself and felt so conspicuous and so alone that she never went back . After her parents left for work , Julia lay on the sofa in her underwear and a tank top , drinking cold milk with Hershey 's syrup and watching TV reruns from before she was born . By July she was so lonely she wanted to die . One day she went for a walk and noticed several people standing in a parking lot . A fancy car pulled up , and two people got in . Julia walked over to a woman in a cranberry suit who reminded her of her father 's secretary . <p> " Where are you going ? " Julia had asked . <p> A space opened up , and they fell out into the light . Ian switched off his headlights . Now he could see that the traffic extended all the way to the city , a two-mile ribbon of wasted time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these conditions are true ) then this will be the outcome . Else if . Else if . Else . She 'd worked as a programmer for a couple of years before she 'd begun to think in code . Now , she found that it calmed her ; it helped her to make decisions . If ( the father is a mechanical engineer , sixfoot-one ) . Else if ( a Russian lawyer , in perfect health ) . Else if ( a musician , with light-brown hair like Kate 's and a slight risk of cancer on his mother 's side ) . Else if . Else . <p> There was a reason to reject every profile . A disappointing academic record , an alcoholic grandparent , acne scars left over from adolescence , dishonesty or arrogance discernable in the way he answered the question " Why did you decide to do this ? " <p> Of course , on terms like this she 'd reject Kate . She 'd reject herself . In their immediate families , she could count three alcoholics , two early heart attacks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of multiple sclerosis , and one probable suicide . Kate sunburned easily ( why was that a question on the profile ; did anyone reject a donor for that ? ) and was frequently depressed . Hannah had an unimpressive college GPA and a late-blooming career . <p> She read the next profile . A twenty-three-year-old computer scientist , five-eleven , a hundred and eighty-two pounds , brown hair and eyes . No health problems , either mental or physical , no evidence of male pattern baldness . He was half Armenian , half Greek . Under cause of death for three of four grandparents he 'd written " civil war . " <p> She knew things about these men she 'd never bothered to ask Kate-their blood types , the occupations of their aunts and uncles-but she did n't know if they were charming or considerate , if they could be trusted . She knew the particulars of their appearance , their eye color and so on , but she could n't tell if they were handsome or ugly or strange . Hannah had been a bartender for most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible fathers from the other side of a long slick bar . She would listen to their voices and assess their looks . She 'd notice their liquors of choice , how much they tipped , whether or not they carried drinks to their companions before they came back for their own . <p> Hannah looked at the driver . She could decipher almost as much about him as she knew about the possible fathers . He appeared to be in his late thirties , average in height and weight , his dark hair cut short to control the curl . He looked as though he worked out , though not every day . He wore a narrow wedding band ( which meant , she thought , that he 'd married while still young and relatively poor ) and the sort of business casual attire-wide-wale corduroy pants and a carefully ironed , un-tucked white shirt-that suggested a media job of some kind . <p> " Jesus , " he said . " What 's that ? " Now that she was paying attention , Hannah noticed his voice . Beneath evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trace of an accent . <p> She squinted up through the windshield . " A helicopter , " she said . <p> " No , look at the bridge . " <p> Hannah looked . A butterfly : enormous , implausible , trussed in the steel cabling of the bridge . <p> " I do n't know , " she said . At such an angle , in the early glare , she could not be sure of the scale of the thing . Perhaps it was only a kite . Except that a helicopter fluttered mechanically near the suspension tower . Up ahead , in the right lane , several police cars , a fire engine with its ladder raised , and two ambulances waited , and in the Bay , beside the bridge , were two Coast Guard boats . <p> " Maybe it 's a suicide . " Suicides usually preferred the more romantic and accessible Golden Gate , so many they 'd had to install phones with direct lines to counselors , but Ian liked the Bay Bridge better . It looked like a piece of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the continent , while the Golden Gate was purely decorative . <p> " It 's turquoise , " Hannah said . " I think it has wings . It must be a hang glider . " <p> " A hang glider could never make it this far . " <p> " Someone with a parachute ? " <p> " They 're probably just filming a movie , " the girl in the back seat said . She did n't care what was happening ahead on the bridge . If a person wanted to fly , he should stay away from bridges . If he wanted to kill himself , he should do it privately , not at rush hour . <p> " I do n't think so , " Hannah said . She often saw camera crews filming chase scenes or commercials on hilly picturesque streets in the city , but this looked like a real accident , not a made-for-TV disaster . <p> For his thirty-eighth birthday , lan 's wife had given him a sky-diving lesson . A calculated risk in the form of a gift certificate . Miranda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a yellow field , reading a book , while he climbed into the hold of the little plane and flew up into the cloudless sky . The fall had not been as terrifying as he 'd hoped . He just closed his eyes and jumped , that was all . He was tethered to the instructor the whole time . Later , during lunch , as he poured the last of an expensive bottle of chardonnay , he asked Miranda if she 'd been watching as he plunged toward her , and she said yes , of course she 'd watched . He knew she was n't telling the truth . <p> He fiddled with the radio dial , against car-pool etiquette , to see whether he could find out anything about the person ( he was sure , now , it was a person ) caught above the bridge . But there was nothing ; not even the traffic reports included the backup on the Bay Bridge . Ian wondered if he 'd imagined the traffic , his two passengers , the parachutist . The morning had begun ordinarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slices of rye toast and a glass of grapefruit juice . He 'd had a pleasant conversation with Miranda before leaving the house . He 'd backed the car out of the driveway and into the street , without hitting the awkwardly placed mailbox or scraping the paint on the untrimmed hedge . As he veered onto the freeway , he thought : If I wanted to , I could leave today and never go back . This was a shock . It was n't the first time he 'd had such a thought-everyone entertained such ideas , no matter how content , how responsible , how in love they might be . But it was the first time Ian had thought this in quite this way , purposefully , as if it were possible . As if it were true . <p> He forced himself to look out , rather than down . White sails flecked the water . The city shone . He was used to seeing the Bay from above ; he 'd been skydiving for years . But stilled , the view was smaller , painful in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , acute . He was in pain , slipping in and out of consciousness . His right arm was useless ; with his left he clung to a steel rope as thick as his waist , although if he let go he would not fall . His rig was caught in the suspension wires like a bird in netting . In his most alert moments he felt more embarrassed than scared . <p> Julia leaned her head against the cool window and stared at the sliver of visible city . She wished Isaac would send up a balloon or raise a flag to signal her . In the closet in the front hallway of her house , behind the coats , there was a white cloth safety-pinned to a wire hanger . Julia , at nine or ten , had insisted on it . Across the fabric , a square ripped from a linen tablecloth , she had colored in the letters O and K in dark blue magic marker . If there were another fire , she would hang the sign from a window , so the firemen would know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been only six the last time , but she remembered everything : the too-bright sky , her mother 's panicked , resolute voice . Before the fire came close , they packed a bag , just one for the two of them , and went to stay with one of her mother 's friends in a small mint-colored bungalow far down on the flats . Julia 's father was in Europe , on a business trip . Julia called for her cat , but Samson was off hunting or curled somewhere napping , and he did n't come . She sobbed for three days , inconsolable , until her father , who 'd flown back from Europe as soon as he could , took her as close as possible to the ruined house . They stood among charred eucalyptus , calling and whistling for Samson . Of course he never came . <p> Her parents built a new house with the insurance money . A bigger , better house made of wide redwood planks , with walls of windows facing the Bay . Julia was allowed to help design her new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compartment . She wanted everything painted pink . Their neighbors on one side built a monstrous Tudor mansion , while the family on the other side chose an Italian villa with trellises and a red tile roof . All of the new houses , too big for their lots , looked as if they might fall off the scorched hill at any moment . For years , there were hardly any trees . <p> She did not know exactly what happened to Isaac at night-he 'd never tell her , no matter how many times she asked-but she knew it was bad . She came to believe that he needed her , that her attention kept him safe . Whenever she climbed onto the F , he said he 'd see her soon , and because he 'd promised , he would . It was as though she 'd imagined him , and she had to see him to make him real . It was harder now that school had started . In the first week and a half she 'd skipped two days , and she had n't been caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ian asked his front-seat passenger . <p> Hannah resisted the urge to turn the papers upside down . She did n't want to get into a complicated discussion . " Applications , " she said . It was true , in a way . <p> " What do you do ? " <p> " Tech stuff , nothing very interesting . " If , she thought , we sit here forever on this bridge . Else if . Else . <p> The girl in the back seat put headphones on . Hannah could hear the hiss and static of her music . She pulled down the sun visor and looked in the little mirror . The girl nodded in time with the rhythm . She looked even younger , Hannah thought , in black . <p> The possible fathers made her anxious . She tried to imagine the twin-helixed thread of a stranger 's DNA wrapped two-ply with her own . <p> " Do you have children ? " she asked , surprising herself . <p> Ian shifted and closed the gap between his car and the one in front . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She just turned six . " <p> They 'd flown to Beijing to get her when she was eleven months old . For weeks before he saw her , Ian had carried her picture everywhere with him , a tiny , wisp-haired girl , unsmiling in a red smocked dress and white shoes . Those weeks before they finalized the paperwork , when she was still an ocean away , had been torture . And then the plane ride , the longest he 'd ever endured , longer even than the journey home , Natalie on Miranda 's lap with the stiff posture and stern mouth of a judge . In the hotel room in Beijing those first numb , amazed nights , Natalie had whimpered and refused to eat , and they 'd had no idea how to calm her . Ian held the baby so awkwardly his shoulders had ached for days . <p> " You 're lucky , " Hannah said . <p> Ian nodded . " You do n't have kids ? " <p> " Not yet . " <p> He had no idea how difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever thought it was easy herself , that she had worried about getting pregnant by accident . When she was younger and slept with boys , it seemed as though all it took was a single mistake , but now that she wanted it to happen , the process was fraught with complications . She and Kate had made a list of possible fathers , men whose appearance and intelligence they approved of , whom they could trust not to panic or steal the baby away . They asked Kate 's cousin , their gay friends Salvatore , Danny , and Tim , and Hannah 's college roommate , the one she 'd dated for a short time in her final effort at straightness . All of them said they 'd think about it , then all of them said no . <p> An unknown donor was simpler logistically and safer legally , but still , Hannah worried . Several of their friends used the sperm bank in Berkeley . What if one chose the same donor as Hannah and Kate ? In California , only twelve children could have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't restricted in the rest of the country , and she 'd read that England had started importing American sperm . She could n't stop thinking about all those half-brothers and half-sisters , possibly hundreds of them , meeting accidentally as adults . What if two of them fell in love ? <p> If only they could make a test-tube baby from two eggs , fusing one of her X chromosomes with one of Kate 's . It had to be possible scientifically , although she 'd never heard of a successful case . There were social and ethical implications , of course , but Hannah would gladly settle for girls . <p> He could n't help it : he looked down . A river , glistering . He was confused , until the river broke into rectangles . Cars and SUVs and buses . He counted three white tops of buses , and counting roused him . Who was down there ? People he knew , certainly . Coworkers , maybe an ex-girlfriend , people he knew but did n't know : security guards and bank tellers . Somehow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought : I could shake this tower and break this bridge . His shoulder hurt . He would not fall . He thought : All of us are going to die . <p> " That poor man , I ca n't imagine what he 's going through . If it is a man . " Hannah had always been afraid of heights . " It might be a woman , " she said . <p> " Less likely , " Ian said . <p> He watched a firefighter rappel up the nearest tower . He hoped the rescue effort would n't take much longer . He was almost out of gas . His habit of letting the needle drop into the red zone drove Miranda crazy . She worried about exactly this type of situation : Ian stranded on the bridge . Irresponsibly , he 'd let his cellphone run out of batteries . He considered turning the ignition off , risking a rear-end collision if the traffic behind him started suddenly , but decided against it . He could hear someone singing , far away , behind him , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the song . <p> Julia tried to distract herself with music , but it did n't work . Two leather-clad men zoomed past on Harleys , in between lanes of stopped cars . She wished for a motorcycle , or even an ordinary bicycle . Once , not very long ago , a man had ridden his bicycle across the bridge , eastbound . Julia had seen it on the news . When the police tried to stop him , he pulled a gun , and they shot him . Julia wanted to get out of the car . She was thirsty , and she had to pee , a combination of sensations so irritatingly contradictory they must have been used for torture in China , or somewhere . She had to get out of the car . She could hitch a ride with the next motorcyclist to pass , or she could walk . She 'd be perfectly safe . The traffic was hardly moving . The cops were busy with whatever was stuck up on the bridge like a kitten in a tree , and anyway , they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you know , " Ian said , " this bridge is actually three bridges ? " <p> No one said anything . <p> " In the middle of the western span , " he continued , " just up ahead , there 's a block of concrete thrust into the floor of the Bay . More concrete than the Empire State Building . " <p> " How do you know ? " Julia asked . <p> Ian shrugged at his rearview mirror . " I read it somewhere . I do n't remember where . " <p> Over the guardrail Hannah could see Treasure Island : a hopeful name for a gray plate of landfill striped with military housing . <p> She pointed . " Imagine living there , " she said . " Marooned in the middle of the Bay . You could n't go anywhere without crossing the bridge . " <p> Julia wrapped the cord around her headphones and zipped them into the front pocket of her backpack . The coating on the door handle had begun to peel . She worried it with her nails , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them onto the floor . She kicked a child 's toy she had n't noticed before and leaned to pick it up . An action figure , a lithe plastic girl wearing a silver costume , her ponytail frozen in mid-swing , arms upheld in a karate pose . Julia 's door was locked ; all four of the Altima 's doors locked automatically when the car reached five miles per hour . She pressed the button to unlock it , but nothing happened . The child lock must have been turned on . What if the driver were a kidnapper or a rapist ? She 'd be trapped . Julia did not panic . Instead she tried to pry open the lock using the karate girl 's slender hand . The driver looked back over his shoulder at her , but he did n't say anything . He looked like the kind of man who never said anything until it was too late . She tried again , but she could n't lift the lock . <p> " Excuse me . " Julia leaned forward . " Could you unlock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think that 's a good idea , " Ian said . <p> " I 'd just feel safer , that 's all , " the girl said . <p> " Safer ? " Ian said . <p> " Yeah , I mean , I 'm in a stranger 's car . Anything could happen . " <p> " Very little could happen . " Ian gestured vaguely at the surrounding traffic , the water only slightly touched by wind . " We 're stuck . " <p> Julia sighed loudly and switched tactics . " Please ? " she said . " It 's not like there 's anywhere I could go . " <p> Ian did n't feel like arguing . He looked at the woman in the front seat . She was doing her best to ignore the conversation . He clicked the locks . <p> " Thanks , " Julia said . She opened the door and stepped out onto the bridge , calmly , as if onto a curb . <p> The girl slammed the door harder than necessary . Ian 's first reaction was irritation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ? But this was the first time , the only time , and she was n't his daughter grown tall and sullen . She was someone else 's kid . What was she doing in the car pool , anyway ? He 'd never let Natalie ride with strangers , not at sixteen , not at twenty-two . This girl was lucky she 'd ended up riding with him . Not that he 'd kept her safe-he had n't even managed to keep her in the car . <p> " Damn it , " he said . " What does she think she 's doing ? " He 'd been responsible for her , and he 'd failed . <p> " You ca n't just let her go , " Hannah said . <p> " What else am I supposed to do ? " Ian glared at her . " You could have said something before . " <p> Hannah looked up at the man on the bridge . At any moment he might fall . She pictured him plummeting to earth , breaking every bone in his body when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was already several car lengths away , darting between cars and SUVs and minivans , her red backpack bobbing . Hannah was quick in a crisis . She opened her door and half-fell onto the tarmac . She had n't expected the wind on the bridge . <p> For a second she forgot why she was there . The whole bridge vibrated , tens of thousands of engines idling at once . She looked up , felt dizzy , looked back down . People shouted at her through car windows , but she could n't understand them . The girl up ahead , running . Hannah chased her between the stalled cars . It felt like she was running on a conveyor belt ; she was sure the bridge beneath her moved . The air fumed with exhaust . She was out of shape , and her chest began to hurt almost immediately . She did n't know the girl 's name . <p> " Hey , " Hannah yelled . " Slow down . " <p> Julia did n't hear and neither slowed nor turned . Nobody paid attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to be noticed . <p> A News 24 helicopter had joined the police helicopter near the tower . They floated , noisy as bees , the beginning of a swarm . Alone again , Ian waited for the woman to catch the girl . His phone was dead ; he could n't call 911 . Should he abandon his car and follow them ? He was tempted to lock the doors and put on some Bach , the partitas or a cello concerto , something soothing . Let them chase each other to the city . He did n't mind waiting for the man on the bridge to be rescued . He reached over and picked up one of the rsums the woman had left on the passenger seat . It looked more like a police report than a CV , the word RESTRICTED stamped in red across the top . The first page listed the applicant 's vital statistics : height , weight , age , et cetera . There was a full medical history . He turned to the last page and read : " My children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to give someone else the chance to start a family . Also , I think my genes are worth passing on . " <p> It was n't a rsum . <p> Ian gave up before Miranda did , even though she was the one who endured the painful tests and treatments , the weeks confined to their bed . She refused to believe that her body had failed her this first , important time , but after three years of worry and disappointments , he 'd had enough . He wanted a child , but he was willing to live without the thrill of combining his genetic code with hers . <p> Hannah could n't keep up with the girl . She slowed her pace enough to look up at the man still clinging to the steel ropes that held them all up . For the first time she wondered if he was already dead , if the helicopters , the emergency crews , the traffic jam , if all of it were a wasted effort . Why should the girl wait on the bridge with everybody else ? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she wanted to do ? She 'd be safe enough , as long as she kept to the white line between lanes , as long as she watched out for motorcycles . She would reach the Embarcadero in fifteen or twenty minutes . Hannah let her go . <p> Julia stopped when she reached the flashing lights . She could n't help it . She stopped and looked up at the glittering bridge . There was a person up there . For a moment she forgot about Isaac . She forgot about Serena , about school and her parents and the coins she 'd have earned if she had n't been stuck on the bridge . All she could see was a slip of turquoise , like a tatter of fabric caught in barbed wire , but she knew there was a person up there . <p> Hannah made her way back to the car , peering through windshields . Everyone looked sad and separate . How would she recognize the car ? She could not remember what make it was , or what color . She did not notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tunnel 's opening . She considered climbing up onto the island ; she had no idea what she 'd find there-an enclave of houses , more military buildings , a bird sanctuary ? But then she heard her name behind her , at least she thought she heard it over the din of cars and radios and helicopters . <p> The woman stopped , and he called again : " Hannah , Kate . " He did n't know which of the two names on the envelope was hers . She did n't look like a Hannah-too small and dark-but he was n't convinced she was a Kate , either . She must have been one or the other , though , because she turned and started toward him . As she moved closer , away from the tunnel 's grip , she appeared to float above the tarmac . He was n't sure what caused the effect ; perhaps simply the strangeness of watching someone walk where he 'd never seen anybody walk before . <p> " What happened ? " he asked . <p> " I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passenger side of the car first and held the door open for her . He was n't sure what brought on the gallant gesture-once he 'd prided himself on opening the passenger door before his own not just on dates but all the time , no matter what his intentions towards his passenger were ( he even did it for men , and for Miranda after he married her ) , but when he bought the Altima , with its electronic key that locked and unlocked all four doors remotely , such courtesy began to seem excessive . <p> He turned the key in the ignition . " So are you Hannah or Kate ? " <p> " Hannah , " she said . " How did you- ? " <p> He nodded at the manila envelope . He 'd put it on the dashboard ; its reflection glowed faintly in the windshield . " After a while I was n't sure you were coming back . I checked for an address in case you did n't . " <p> He wanted to ask about the contents of the envelope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side window at Angel Island to the north . <p> " I wonder what was so urgent , " she said . She missed the girl in the back seat . With only two passengers , the car no longer qualified as a high occupancy vehicle . Officially , it did n't matter , because the car pool lane ended at the toll plaza . But inside the car , the rules disappeared . <p> " Everything 's urgent when you 're a kid . " Except for his daughter , who was more patient and reasonable than most adults he knew . It unnerved him . He looked sideways at Hannah . " see what you have to look forward to ? " <p> Hannah picked up the envelope . " Did you open this ? " she asked . <p> " I should n't have . My curiosity got the better of me . " Ian watched her face change . " I 'm sorry , " he said . <p> " It 's private , " Hannah said , although it was n't . She 'd already dealt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already endured a lesson on optimal sperm insertion from a midwife who 'd once been on a blind date with Kate . And then there were the possible fathers themselves . <p> " I really am sorry , " Ian said . Hannah ignored him , but he was nervous now , and when he was nervous he could never stop talking . " It 's quite a process , is n't it ? My wife and I tried everything : bed rest , hormone shots , in vitro , acupuncture , awful smelling herbs . Nothing worked . " <p> " Really ? " Hannah could n't keep the surprise out of her voice . <p> " We ended up adopting . " <p> " That 's great , " Hannah said . " I mean , it 's great that it worked out . Your daughter 's very lucky . " <p> " We 're all lucky . Natalie 's a great kid . " <p> Hannah shook out the profiles . " So did you see anyone you liked ? " she asked . <p> Ian 's smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was curious about him , too . " <p> " Could n't you just ask someone you know ? " <p> " We tried that . Everyone said no . " Hannah looked over at the driver as she said this . Sitting there beside her , tapping one hand on his corduroy thigh , he seemed as plausible as any of the possible fathers . In programming , you had to take into account every parameter , every circumstance , every possible factor . Hannah thought she 'd done that , but she had n't . Here was proof of her mistake : another option . If she wanted it to , it could happen . She felt absolutely certain of that . She 'd never have to see him again . But there was Kate , who by now would be at work in downtown Oakland , beside the garlanded lake . Kate , who would not yet have heard about the man with the parachute . <p> Someone knocked on lan 's window . A cop . He put his gloved hand on the rim of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motioned to Ian to open the window . <p> The girl from the back seat was standing next to him , her cheeks flushed from running , her small chin pointed and defiant . She was still holding the silver-clad karate girl . <p> " This your daughter ? " the cop asked . <p> " No , " Ian said . <p> " Yes , " Hannah said at exactly the same time . She did not know why she felt such a compulsion to lie for the girl . <p> " Which is it ? " <p> " He 's my stepfather , " the girl explained . " We do n't get along . " <p> Inexplicably , Ian felt hurt and tempted to defend himself . <p> " I caught her wandering on the bridge , " the cop said . <p> " Thank you , officer , " Hannah said . " We were worried . " <p> Ian gave the girl the most punishing look he could muster . " Get in the car . " <p> The cop opened the back door like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future . We have enough to deal with as it is . " <p> " Oh , we will , " Ian said . <p> Julia slipped in behind him and slouched in her seat . <p> " You 're lucky we covered for you , " Ian said . " You could have been in serious trouble . " <p> " Thanks , " Julia said . <p> " What happened ? " Hannah asked . <p> " I stopped to look , and that guy saw me , " Julia said . " I did n't want him to call my parents . " <p> " So you lied , " Ian said . <p> " I guess . " <p> " Could you see any more from up there ? " Hannah asked . <p> " Not really , " Julia said . <p> The jumper watched his rescuer draw closer , sidestepping along the suspension cable , a high wire acrobat above an audience of thousands . The man appeared to shout , but the jumper could n't hear him above the din of the helicopter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smashing into the bridge , he blistered with panic . He watched as the man lowered himself onto the spunsteel cable and cut the lines to his canopy . <p> He did not fall . He did not plunge three hundred rushing feet and hit the water , and he did not arch into the cool sea-level air . His rescuers ( suddenly there were two ; he did not know where the second had come from ) tended to the wound on his neck , splinted his arm , and wrapped him in a silver blanket . A basket fastened to a cord appeared , and they lifted him into it . He shut his eyes and let them haul him up to safety . <p> Author Affiliation
