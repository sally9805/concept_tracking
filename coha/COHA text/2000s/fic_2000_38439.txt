THE GRAY-SKINNED COUPLE smoking cigarettes ask for two beers and two cups of tea . I give them what they want . It 's my first night . I got this job by saying I had been a waitress at a truck stop . If I had known how readily a lie can take the truth 's place , I might have set up a new life years ago . <p> I told Joe I was from Colorado . I 've never been to Colorado-I have no wish ever to go-I only picked it so I would not be tempted to attach my imaginary waitressing career to ligaments of my real life . I do that sometimes , hook up a necessary lie to the architecture and geography of my real life , and in two weeks ' time I am remembering the smell of diesel oil and chili sauce at my last truck stop . <p> I could n't say I used to be a waitress in a small town in Massachusetts where , in fact , the closest I came to anything so organized and purposeful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past quartercentury I have been entirely occupied with such work : I volunteered to raise three sons , and to be a wife and wash everybody 's socks and underwear and keep track of their dental appointments and their sports equipment and their emotional lives . Nobody made me . Nobody paid me . I volunteered . It gets old . Actually , what it gets is over . <p> Anyway , I figured if I said I was a waitress where I used to live for real , my mind would start blurring memory and in no time at all I would be making reckless remarks to the night cook about how we used to alter the direction of the meatloaf , do other than the usual things with pine nuts , saute unexpected things with A-1 sauce , when I worked at the Blue Bonnet in Granby , Massachusetts . So I said Colorado purposely . I have no idea what people eat there , what they read or drive or wear , so I am less likely to hold forth on my imagined history or the gadget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Two more beers , miss , if you please . " <p> " With tea ? " I 'm smiling . <p> The wife frowns at me . She thinks I 'm flirting with her husky husband . <p> " No , but you could bring a basket of them chips and salsa , " he says . <p> The wife frowns again . She thinks he 's flirting back . <p> I sashay over to the bar . I feel as though I have been a waitress all my life , and my mother and two aunts before me . I see myself in a tight polyester robin's-egg-blue uniform , stretched out across my bed , counting tips and chewing gum . <p> Actually I am wearing black ankle-socks and slacks and a red pullover sweater , my interpretation of Joe 's scornful uniform policy : " What the hell do I care ? " <p> " So what time do they start pouring in ? " I ask Joe . <p> " Who ? " he says like I just made an ethnic slur about his people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know , the regulars , the trade , your eating clientele . I do n't know , cops looking for a free manicotti , the takeout set , the Christian women 's business club , or whoever it is comes here . " <p> " What are you , some wise guy ? " Joe says . <p> I look beguiling and smile . I bet there 's not a two-inch hair-free zone on Joe 's whole body . <p> I just wondered . I do n't want to be taken off guard by a bus of highschool wrestlers or a homeless person . I do a fair amount of looking out for the great What Next . I start to memorize the menu . <p> " You hungry ? " Joe asks . <p> " No , I just want to see what we 're selling here . " <p> " Well , you look hungry . " Joe makes it sound like any waitress worth her order pad has given up on eating long ago . <p> My first thought when our next live one walks through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The man is small and spare and mostly bald and stooped at the shoulders like someone who has been ducking his head his whole life-keeping a low profile-though he ca n't be over five foot seven . This has to be what a mass murderer looks like when he is in a truck stop . Even though I know as well as anyone that most axe-murderers-I 'm talking twelve massacres and up-have little paunches , and their eyes are n't wild ; if anything , they 're mild , glassy , vacant , set in puffy doughboy skin . <p> His head jerks several times to take in every corner , though there 's only the tea and beer team and Joe and I. The man 's a study in nervous foibles . I do n't think he 's here to make new friends . <p> " Are you going to take him a menu ? " Joe swipes the counter , never taking his eyes off the TV . <p> " Nope , " I say . There is n't enough money in the world to do some jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man . " What 'll it be , buddy ? " <p> The man looks up , clearly puzzled . What will what be ? " Oh , uh , do you have coffee ? " <p> " Yep . " Joe makes a project of looking bored . <p> " And bread . " The man speaks the two words into his shirt pocket . <p> " That it ? " Joe says . <p> " And meat . Do you have meat ? " <p> " You mean like meatballs or pork chops or steak or what ? " It seems there is no meat Joe could not produce on demand . I 'm hoping this man will ask for spring lamb with green mint jelly and small , butter-roasted new potatoes . <p> " Meatballs , " he says . <p> I look out the window . In the last four seconds I 've made up a blizzard in my mind , had the five of us snowbound here . But beyond the smudged plate glass is only empty dark , or maybe nothing , maybe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of night it is . <p> I 'm tempted to ask Joe how come they hired me if there is no trade , but I keep my mouth shut . I need the job , not just for the tips I 'll make , but for the form and substance . My life has gotten a little out of hand in the last week . <p> Two teenagers walk in . A couple . Do they still say that ? They look like they have been together for a hundred years , like they drag their relationship behind them everywhere . They 're wearing the same denim on the same slumped frames . They probably have settled down to one position to make love in , have picked out one certain word they always call it . <p> They order double home-fries and two beers . I know they 're underage , but I 'm hardly in any position to start judging other people . Besides , I 'm glad they 're here . I figure the boyfriend is big enough to deal with our diminutive axe-murderer should he have one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Joe nods to the two beers on the counter and jabs his thumb in the direction of the couple . I deliver the beers with what I hope is a jaded eye . If they order seconds , I 'll ask to see ID 's . I want this young man sober enough to deal with any antics Jake the Rake gets up to , although so far all he 's done is push his meatballs around the plate and soak up the sauce with bread . If he intends to do us harm , it 's going to take all night . <p> Three fat ladies waddle in and squeeze their pleased and perfumed selves into a booth and ask if there is any pie . They 've just been somewhere or they 're on their way . They 're all excited . You can tell they were the kind of teenagers who inhaled bags of potato chips and pints of onion dip when they babysat , who told each other complicated lies and married at twenty-nine , feeling lucky in eleven different ways . <p> I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they must have been at the age of five or ten or fifteen . Or sometimes I see what sort of crinkled-up or frog-fat old lady someone is slated to be . The thing 's so easy once you start ; you wonder everybody does n't go around doing it all day . Maybe they do . <p> I wish these women had n't come . They water it all down , dilute the whole experience . Even Jake the Rake seems only puny , nervy , now they 're here . It always happens . New people wander in and they dilute and redefine the ones that you had all faced in your mind a certain way . Like if a group of abusive husbands or a busload of high-church clergy came through the door , I 'd start to see these old girls in a whole new way . So much of life is by comparison . What 's that old vaudeville joke ? " How 's your wife ? " " Compared to what ? " <p> How 's your wife ? <p> " You 'll never make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and frightened and bereft himself-shouted at the door . " You ca n't even earn a living . " <p> As though I had not earned the very right to live , to these thirty years , had n't paid hard cash for the privilege , every blessed day . <p> " You 'll never make it . You 've been clinging to the kids their whole lives , hanging on as hard in high school as you did when they were born . You 've been a tagalong for years , and guess what , sister , I got money says you wo n't have a clue how to make a life for only you . " <p> " Do you think I should get that plain or ' a la mode ? " the fattest woman asks . <p> These three heavily fleeced women invite me to feel tastefully superior , or at least grateful that however much my life 's a sinkholed failure , at least I am not them . Like I said , comparison . When I put the pie down , I brush one fleece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would feel so innocent to blind fingers ; the women themselves are probably soft if you could keep them quiet for five minutes while the blind man groped them . But they are practicing , card-carrying deceivers ; the very clothes they wear can make the sparks fly . They 've dressed themselves in chemicals from head to toe , and sprayed their soft , white , any-day-now flabby bodies with five or six different scented potions , releasing in the process enough ozone-eaters to create two new small holes to welcome in the ultraviolet . Their lives flirt every day with science fiction . <p> I walk over to support the kitchen wall . What have I got against these silly women ? They 've done nothing wrong . Or they 've done everything wrong , but what 's that got to do with me ? I 'm in charge of pie distribution here . I am so always and eternally overreaching . I get so wrapped up with everyone I see : imagining them as schoolchildren and potty , dotty old women and old men , offering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My kids would tell me : GET A LIFE . It always sounds so harsh . It always sounds so right . <p> The door pushes open , and a small , wizened woman walks in , blinking , tentative , taking time to accommodate the light . A little girl in a green woolen dress-up coat with a black velvet collar steps out from behind her . It 's like some magic-show trick where the big attraction is hidden behind a small obstacle . The child glows . My first notion is that had we been paying closer attention , we all would have seen yellow rays spiking out in all directions from behind the old woman . Then it hits me . This child is not some supernatural light source . She 's on fire . She 's got a fever . Her eyes have that hot , blazing gaze , that black-eyed stare . <p> I meet them in the center of the tables . <p> " She 's got a fever , " I say to the old woman . <p> " I know , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She started with it on the bus . " She turns and points at our reflection in the windowglass . I try to puzzle out some big silver Greyhound bus hidden in the images we make . <p> " Where 's the bus ? " I ask like if only we knew , we 'd be all set . " Gone , " the woman says . " It 's gone . I was taking Annie with me to my sister 's place . Her husband 's gone . " <p> Like the bus . <p> " My sister buries her husband in the morning . Ten n.M. , " she says . " Sharp . " <p> I have the feeling there is some conventional response this news means to evoke , but I ca n't figure what it is . I am aware that the restaurant 's gone silent around us . No one speaks . The last song on the jukebox fades with two final , halfhearted croons . I turn around . Everyone is watching . Even Jake the Rake is staring at the child across his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play . I used to have a shrink who said I felt that way on purpose so I could keep myself from getting close to other people . I stick my tongue out at him . The old woman winces . <p> " Oh no , " I say . " I was n't . . . That was n't . . . " <p> She looks so old and tired . <p> " Where do you live ? " I ask . <p> " Hendersonville . Two hours from here . My sister 's in Cleveland . Six hours the other way . I got off to find Annie some aspirin tablets and a cool drink . " <p> " Oh no , not aspirin , " I say . " Aspirin can cause Reye 's syndrome in children under eighteen . " Tylenol or Advil till they leave for college . ( I 've always figured God made it safe for kids to switch to aspirin at eighteen because that 's when they leave home , and there is n't going to be anybody in the dorm or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is aspirin-free . You spend your life-your self-making sure your kids do n't ride in compact cars , or eat too fast and choke , or trip on the hall runner , or walk through a room where people are smoking dope , and then you send them off to college , where neither you nor anybody else will ever check on anything again . You spend eighteen years protecting them at every turn , and then you stand by and watch them jump off a cliff . You go from staying awake until you know they 're home safe to staying awake until you get some bleak gray-dawn assurance that there is going to be another day . ) <p> " Could we get her a drink , do you suppose ? " the old woman asks . " Oh yes . Sorry . Of course . Here . Let her sit down . I 'll get a Coke , no ice . I 'll stir the bubbles out . Do you like Coke ? " I ask the little girl . <p> She nods . " With bubbles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoker , about forty-five . <p> Behind the counter , I pour the soda back and forth between two glasses to defizz it . I read one time that a child 's stomach ca n't deal with all the bubbles , and so it spews them up into the tiny , crowded Eustachian tubes , where they cause an infection . " I 'd like to see the article that said that " : my husband 's voice , snide even in memory . <p> The little girl inhales the Coke , and I bring her a dish of ice to suck on , tiny cubes and melting slivers . One of the fat pie-ladies gives me two Children 's Tylenol that I get the girl to crunch . For twenty years I never left the house without a blister-pack of Children 's Tylenol . There may still be two or three antique tablets in the lining of my purse . <p> " I do n't know what to do , " the old woman says . " I wonder if we ought to find her some doctor or someplace to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' time six of us are packed into the teenagers ' big boat of a Chevrolet . Joe 's back at the restaurant , all alone . The fat ladies left when we did . Home to TV , no doubt-the Home Shopping Network , if I do n't miss my guess . I volunteered to go along to the doctor , and the boy said he 'd give us a lift , and surprise , surprise , Jake the Rake said , " I might as well come too . " <p> The grandmother 's holding Annie on her lap in the front seat . I considered launching a crusade to get the woman to put Annie in a separate seatbelt , but I 've already kept her from getting Reye 's syndrome and an ugly Eustachian-tube carbonation infection . A person can only be obnoxious so many times in one evening . I spent one whole lifetime keeping three people from getting things they did n't know existed . I 'm retired . <p> I 'm scrunched in the back between the girlfriend-whose hair smells like thyme and lavender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Juicy Fruit-and this man whom I expect to murder all of us before we reach the hospital . He smells like metal . I think about saying something casual about how I always carry a small automatic pistol . I think about asking if he can pinpoint just when his life started to get out of hand . <p> The emergency room takes approximately forever . The teenage boy keeps feeding dollar bills into the broken coffee machine . The way I figure it , he 's lucky it 's not working . Jake the Rake decides as long as he 's here he might as well have them take a look at a cut he 's got that 's turned all pus-y . He peels off a dirty bandage and shows me the wound before I can look away . I knew I 'd suffer at his hands . The nurse gives him a tetanus shot , a sample tube of bacitracin , and a hospital-sized Band-Aid . Then the teenage girl remembers that her throat is sore . Her boyfriend tells her to get over it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find yourself in a jewelry store , and suddenly you think you need a crystal budvase . You 're in an ER late at night , and your whole body wants a pill , your limbs cry out for plaster casts and penicillin or at the very least professional attention . <p> What 's the symptom I 've brought here tonight ? Let 's see . Somebody shot a big hole in my life . I shot a big hole in it myself . I was in a twoperson collision . My life just got run over by a tractor-trailer truck . I eye the candy machine . I have spent the last four hours surrounded by mounds of mashed potatoes and strange gravy and pot roast and green beans , and now that I am marooned in a hospital , suddenly I 'm ravenous . <p> " The doctor says old Annie here 'll be just fine . " The old woman walks toward us . " Ear infection . He gave her pills . Her fever 's down already from the aspirin . " <p> Tylenol . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the woman says . " The doctor thinks she should n't travel more tonight , but the next bus leaves at midnight , and how am I to make the funeral if we sleep here ? " <p> " Where are her parents ? " I think the night allows the question . <p> " Dead . She 's an orphan . " <p> I wince again . I realize this is not likely new information to the little girl , but it still seems harshly put . <p> " If I had someplace for her to stay . . . " The old woman scans the waiting room . <p> " She could stay with me , " I say . " I 'm staying in a house with extra bedrooms . My landlady 's a nurse . " ( A fact I did not find out till last night , and then , for the first time in weeks , I slept the sleep of the dead . That delicious . ) <p> " Well , if you 're sure . " The old lady 's bumping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointed . I want to keep the child tonight , I might like to keep her forever , but I want the woman to ask for references and a picture ID and character witnesses and proof of citizenship and that I 've had all my shots and a certificate of mental health . <p> " I 'll pick her up in two days . I 'll call if it 's any longer . I probably ought to take your phone number . " <p> I want to shake this woman . I want to tell her I could be a white slaver or a drug addict or a lunatic . For the first time , I look down at the little girl . Annie . I 've purposely stayed focused on the grandmother until now . The sight of that small face snaps me back to Monday , to fast action , to sensible behavior . She 's five years old . That 's a full-time job , for starters . Plus it 's past her bedtime and she 's in a strange place with a fever and an earache and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's asleep , tucked up in my bed . I could n't have her wake up alone in a strange house . The teenagers are probably make ing out on the sprung-spring sofa in her parents ' den , and Jake the Rake is off to Cleveland with Annie 's granny . When we dropped her at the bus terminal , Jake hopped out mumbling something about how he might as well go too . I say good riddance . I know he wo n't hurt the grandmother . Her mind 's on other things . Joe probably closed shop early and went home . The three fat ladies , no doubt adenoidal , are now snoring in three different beds . <p> I squirm around and try to nestle in the big dead chair . It 's like a wild beast somebody shot and dragged home to use as furniture . Then I remember : the old couple with the beer and tea , the first customers of my one-night waitressing career . I ca n't believe I just forgot them . Whited them from memory in an hour 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many people you cart to the emergency room in the middle of the night or invent imaginary destinations and life stories for , there 's always someone who gets left out . Overlooked , like the tea-beer couple , or left behind on purpose , like Joe , the old cook and bottle-washer . Like David , the old husband . <p> David the old husband who would surely have a speech to make if he were here tonight . " You think you can just keep this little girl , " he would say . " You think you can just take her home and plug her into your old life . Buy her clothes and be her mother and for the next thirteen years substitute her for a life of your own . " <p> " Oh , shut up , " I say out loud . <p> Annie does n't stir . <p> " Do n't think you can bring her home and expect me to start all over . " <p> Do n't worry . <p> " I have a clue for you , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't make up a life going through the world collecting children who need watching over and a place to sleep and somebody to sit up all night beside the bed . " <p> Annie blinks awake , as though responding to the harshness of the words inside my head . <p> " Where 'd Granny go ? " <p> " Remember ? She went on the bus , and she 'll be back to pick you up before you know it . " <p> The child frowns . <p> " Do you always sleep in that chair ? " she asks me . <p> " Oh , no , I do n't even really live here . I live far away . " <p> " Are you waiting for your granny or somebody to come pick you up ? " <p> " I never even knew my granny , either one . They both died before I was born . " <p> " My parents died before I was born . " <p> I forbear to speak to the unlikeliness of this timing . We each of us have our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleepy ? " <p> " Nope , " I say . <p> " Me neither . I 'm never sleepy . I could stay up for a hundred nights . " <p> " Me too . " Actually , it feels like I have . <p> " I have ten ponies . They 're my own . " <p> " That 's amazing . " <p> " They 're alive . " <p> " I figured that they were . " <p> " My granny is n't coming back . She was taking me to Cleveland to leave me in an orphanage . " <p> With her ten ponies . <p> Actually the child 's story sounds believable , even though I am not certain such things as orphanages still exist . You never hear of them or drive by one on your way to someplace else . But if there are n't any , then where do all the orphans live ? I have visions of Carol Burnett in that movie , menacing motherless children . Then I remember foster care . <p> " No , sweetheart , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . " " She has n't got a sister . It 's just her and me and no more family , and now she 's old-she says she wants me settled . " <p> I know she 's telling stories , as we used to say , but at the same time I 'm filling out adoption applications in my mind . <p> " Is everything all right here ? " My landlady , the nurse , taps on the door as she pushes it open . I may need to reconsider the idea of living here forever . I 'm fond of locks and privacy . As though this nurse would have come to visit were the little girl not here . A child is always an excuse for what you want to do . " Are you girls all right ? " <p> " Fine , " I say . " We 're just talking . We 're not sleepy . " <p> " I never get sleepy , " Annie says . <p> " Me neither , " says the nurse . <p> And does she have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I was a little girl , " the nurse says . " I made those tiny notches on the windowsill with my front teeth . I still remember the neat feeling , the soft crunches of the paint . " <p> " You know , of course , " I say to Annie , " not to do that yourself . There 's lead in the paint , and it 's not good for you . " <p> I catch the nurse 's scowl . " It used to be OK , " I say , to placate . Actually , it used to be lethal , but all kids did it . I think my own palate remembers paint . My teeth imprints are probably everywhere . We all grew up doing these horrendously dangerous things in our pre-seatbelt childhoods . The whole thing 's an illusion anyway . You pretend you can protect your child from harm , and if all goes perfectly he grows up and falls victim to adulthood anyway . <p> " Ever thought of a relationship where you are not den mother in charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are not in charge at all ? " my husband 's mean voice hectors . <p> " PHHHHTTTT , " I snort at him . <p> " What 's that you say ? " the nurse asks me . <p> " PHHHHTTTT . " Annie imitates my noise . <p> If we were all blood relatives , now someone would have to say , " Well , do n't you think it 's time you tried to get some sleep ? " As it is , we three might talk all night . <p> " My little brothers were born in that room . " The nurse taps the wall . " Nobody had babies at home then , but my mother was a pistol . She had twins when she was only expecting one . She nicknamed the second baby Extra for a joke , and that 's what we still call him-well , X. The first twin , John , died in Vietnam . My brother X is a pilot . " <p> " And your mom was a pistol , " Annie says . " My mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm guessing if your mom dies before you 're born , she can have been anything . <p> " She was going to be very famous , " Annie said . <p> " I was going to be famous , " the nurse says . " I was going to be Clara Barton and Florence Nightingale . " <p> " Are n't you still ? " <p> " Oh , no . I got too old . " <p> " And that 's your reason ? " Annie 's starting to look tired . " It 'll do . " <p> " What were you going to be ? " Annie turns to me . <p> " You know , for years I 've been telling people I wanted to work in a truck stop , like the one you came into tonight . " <p> " See . " Annie 's eyelids droop , heavy . " See , " she tells the nurse . " You can be anything you want . A movie star or Clara Barton or a famous waitress . My granny 's going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just have to pick one thing . " And Annie is asleep . She 's riding on a pony all the way to Cleveland , where she 'll live in a swanky orphanage forever until her grandmother comes back on Tuesday to pick her up . <p> " Do you believe that stuff she said ? " The nurse scrunches her lips tight . " Do you ? " <p> " No , " I say . " Well , maybe . " <p> " Kids do n't have a clue . When I slept in that bed , there was nothing in the world I was n't going to do . Then time came along and took my life and shook it down to hardly anything at all , and I grew up and moved across the hall . I wonder if anybody 's life is what they wanted . " " Probably astronauts , " I say . " And firemen . " <p> And she who never tires grows sleepy , says a quick good-night ; and leaves the night to only me . <p> When I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to threaten me in the parking lot beside the school , first thing in the morning .

There were several retouched faces , boys in suits and ties , with funny haircuts , girls in black drapes I can not remember donning for my graduation photograph . What held the drapes in place ? Was n't there even one girl who refused to put one on ? <p> SHAWNEEN VAN TASSEL . " SHAWN .

If you 're bent on besting old Florence Nightingale at her own game or starting your own orphanage or being a jewel in the crown of Jesus or threatening the health and safety of two puny , pimpled seventhgraders in the parking lot before school , then do it with a vengeance , scare the pants off those two girls , leave teeth marks in their memory of seventh grade so deep that the mention of your name gives pause a full thirty years after you are dead . <p> I turn out the light and add my own P.S. : Nobody , not one of us , knows what 's going to happen , and it is bright-purple , patent arrogance to give up hope because you think you 're so damn smart you know your life is sure to be a sinkhole from now on .
