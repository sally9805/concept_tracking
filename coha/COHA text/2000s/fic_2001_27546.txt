I needed to force money from Father Joseph , and it made me nervous . He had bribed me once before , for a building permit , soon after he became principal of Rosary School . Also , he had admitted my granddaughter , Asha , into his school without our having to make the enormous donation usually required . But Father Joseph was strange and unpredictable . Several months ago , his school , in a posh part of Old Delhi , had given a dinner party to introduce him . Because of my work for the Delhi municipal education department , I was invited . During the party Father Joseph demonstrated his expertise in karate . The party was in the school 's front field . A steel pole had been cemented upright several meters from the buffet tables . Father Joseph , short , and heavy with muscle , wearing the white robe of a karate teacher , beat at the pole for half an hour with his bare feet and fists while forty or fifty people watched and ate . Sometimes he would step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Near the end of his demonstration , he became so tired that there were pauses as long as a minute between blows . Because this was so odd , and because Father Joseph had spoken to me in English when the party started , at first I thought the display might be an example of a foreign affectation . After he was done , still dressed in the robe , Father Joseph spent the rest of the night meeting his guests . He kept clenching and unclenching his hands from soreness . It was morning . The sky was a single blue from edge to edge . I had just bathed and was on my balcony hanging a towel over the ledge . The May heat was so intensethat as soon as I stepped out of the flat , worms of sweat appeared on my bald scalp . In the squatter colony behind our compound several women crouched before their huts , cooking breakfast on kerosene stoves . Two men wearing only shorts and rubber slippers stood next to a hand pump , soaping their bodies . On the roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter with a tin bucket and a bowl . The naked girl , perhaps seven or eight years old , kept slipping out of her mother 's grasp and running about the roof . I had been Mr. Gupta 's moneyman for a little less than a year and was no good . It did not take me long to realize this , and once I did , unwilling to give up the increased pay , I tried to delight in having achieved a position that exceeded my ability . I enjoyed believing that I had tricked Mr. Gupta into giving me a place near all the illegal money that poured through the education department . This pleased me so much that I pictured myself weeping in the middle of negotiations with some school principal and calling myself a " whore " while I kept a hand over my heart . But on the mornings before bribe collections , these fantasies came involuntarily . Now , instead of making me laugh , they made me feel threatened , as if I were crazy and out of control . The principals I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more competent and responsible . I had never graduated from higher secondary , and my job as a junior officer in the physical education department officially involved little more than counting cricket bats and badminton rackets and making sure that 4 percent of a school 's land was used for physical education . My panic in negotiations was so apparent that even people who were eager to bribe me became resentful . At the meals they were custom-bound to serve with the bribe , they joked about my weight . " You 're as good as two men , " they might say as I piled food on my plate , or would remark , " Have you been fasting ? " With principals who appeared even more uncertain than I was , I sometimes grew angry to the point of incoherence . Occasionallybecause of my heart attack seven months earlier and the medicines I now tookas I talked with them , I got tired , confused , and sleepy . My general incompetence and laziness at work had been apparent for so long that I now think it was arrogant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am the type of person who does not make sure that a file includes all the pages it must have or that the pages are in the right order . I refuse to accept even properly placed blame , lying outright that somebody else had misplaced the completed forms or spilled tea on them , even though I was the last one to sign them out or had the soggy papers still on my desk . All this is common for a certain type of civil servant who knows that he is viewed with disdain by his superiors and that he can not lose his job . My predecessor as moneyman , Mr. Bajwa , used to lie even about what he had brought for lunch . He would rather eat on the office roof than not lie . Mr. Bajwa , however , had incredible energy . He also had a compulsion to court everyone who came near him . Many times he had told me that I was one of his best friends , even though it was apparent that he did not like me . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rajiv Gandhi and became Prime Minister in the last elections , the Central Bureau of Investigation wanted to show its loyalty to the new rulers by attacking the Congress Party and its supporters . They brought corruption charges against Mr. Bajwa . Since then , Rajiv Gandhi had forced out V. P. Singh and put Rajiv 's pawn Chandrashekar in power . And the upcoming elections might make Rajiv Gandhi Prime Minister again . When the mother finished bathing her daughter , I went inside . The last twelve months had been long and sorrowful . They began with my wife , Radha , finally dying of cancer . A few months later , I had a heart attack that woke me in the middle of the night screeching , " My heart is breaking , " so loudly that my neighbors kicked open the door of the flat to see what was happening . More recently , my son-in-law Rajinder had died when his scooter slipped from beneath him on an oil slick . And then Anita , my daughter , and eight-year-old Asha had come to live with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to look away . Asha was asleep on my cot with one knee pulled up to her stomach . My room is a windowless narrow rectangle , and the little light from the balcony and kitchen , funneled through the common room behind me , was a handkerchief on her face . Asha sometimes fell asleep on my cot while she waited for me to leave the bathroom . I knelt beside the cot to wake her gently . Her eyelids were trembling . When Rajinder was alive and Anita used to bring Asha with her on visits , I would ask Asha how school was and offer her round orange-flavored toffees that , despite her laughing denials , I claimed grew on a small tree in a cupboard . Nothing else was expected from me . Since they had moved in two months ago , misery as intense as terror had drained all the fat from Asha 's body , making her teeth appear larger than they were and her fingers impossibly long . This made me try to say more , but when I asked her about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept looking at Asha , I noticed it was possible to see her as pretty . Her face was almost square and her hair chopped short like a boy 's , but there was something both strong and vulnerable about her . She had long eyelashes and a mouth that was too large for her face and hinted at an adult personality . I wondered whether I was finding beauty in Asha because her youth was a distraction from my own worries , like turning to a happy memory during distress . I put a hand on Asha 's knee . It was the size of an egg and its delicacy made me conscious of her lighter-than-air youth and of my enormous body pressing down on my scarred heart . In the squatter colony a hand pump creaked and someone made clucking sounds as a horse stomped . I heard Anita 's sari sighing as she moved about the kitchen . The municipality gave our neighborhood water in the morning for only three hours . " Wake up , " I said . " The water will go soon . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She wore her school uniform , a blue shirt and a maroon skirt . The common room is nearly empty and has pink walls and a gray concrete floor . In a corner a fridge hums , because the kitchen is too small to hold it . Along a wall crouch a pair of low wooden chairs . On the bathroom 's outside wall are a sink and a mirror . Asha looked in the mirror and combed her hair . The prettiness she had had while sleeping was still there . I could take care of Asha , as I had by arranging her admission to Rosary School . The idea of purpose soothed me . Father Joseph was going to be difficult and disorderly . I had no subsidized land or loan to offer in immediate return for the money I needed to collect . The funds were for the Congress Party 's parliamentary campaign , and the favors earned by donating would have to be cashed in later . Also , this was the second time in twelve months that Parliament had been dissolved and elections called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the supervisor of Delhi municipality 's physical education program , were resisting a second donation . Besides , I had to collect enough to impress the Congress Party officials who reviewed Mr. Gupta 's efforts , but I could not take so much that Father Joseph would later resist giving when the money was for those of us who worked in the education department . Asha went onto the balcony and hung her towel beside mine on the ledge . In comparison , hers looked little bigger than a washcloth . When she returned , I asked , " Do you want some yogurt ? " The only time Asha ate anything eagerly was when she thought that the food was in some way special . Asha normally got yogurt only with dinner . I ate yogurt twice a day because the doctor had suggested it . For a moment she looked surprised . Then she said , " Absolutely . " " Get two bowls and spoons and the yogurt . " Asha brought these . I was too fat to fold my legs and so usually sat with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , placing the bowls between my legs , began spooning yogurt into them . I was wearing just an undershirt and undershorts , as I normally do around the flat . But that morning , because I had seen Asha as pretty for the first time , I felt shy and tried pulling in my legs . I could n't , and a bright blossom of humiliation opened in my chest . Anita stepped to the kitchen door . " What are you doing ? " she asked . Anita was wearing a widow 's white sari . For a moment I thought she was asking me . " Nanaji said I could have some yogurt , " Asha answered . Anita considered us . Her forehead furrowed into lines as straight as sentences in a book . She was short , with an oval face and curly hair that reached her shoulder blades . Anita turned back into the kitchen . I believed she felt her presence was a burden on me . When I offered to pay for Asha 's schoolbooks , Anita refused , even though Rajinder had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts of what she bought with my money . Anita came out of the kitchen with our breakfasts . She and Asha sat across from me . We all had a glass of milk and a salty paratha . Asha ate her yogurt first and quickly . When she could no longer gather anything from the inside of the bowl with the spoon , she licked it . " We should buy more milk so you can make more yogurt for her , " I told Anita . I was carefully scraping my bowl to get the last drops . I held the bowl at chest level and dipped my mouth down to suck on the spoon , because bringing my hand up to my neck caused it to tremble . The yogurt 's sourness made my shoulder muscles loosen and made even this indignity bearable . " She would n't eat it . " " I would , " Asha said . " She 'd eat it two days , Pitaji , and then stop . " Asha stared into her lap . After a moment Anita contemptuously added , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why and the milkman says , Tell America not to fight Iraq . ' " " His cows drive cars ? " My voice came out loud and Anita 's face froze . " Let 's try it for two days , then , " I added softly , feeling sorry that Anita thought I could turn on her . Anita gathered our plates and stood . She went into the kitchen and squatted beneath the stone counter that runs around the kitchen at waist level . She turned on a tap . It gave a hiss , but only a few drops fell out . Anita sat down and looked at the plates for a moment . Beneath the counter were several tin buckets full of water . " Thank God we had water this long , " I said . Anita turned to me , and she appeared so intent I thought she might be angry . " We should thank God for so little ? " She did not wait for me to answer . Anita began washing the dishes with ashes and cupfuls of water from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore only white and always kept her head covered as if she were a widow in a movie . These details , like many others about her , appeared so exactly right , they felt planned . " We should buy a water tank , " I said . " Ever since I became Mr. Gupta 's man , I make so much money I do n't even know how to hide it . " Anita did not respond . My guilt thickened . The kitchen is tiny , yet Anita spent most of her days there , even reading the paper while crouched on the floor . I think Anita did this because she filled the kitchen completely and this comforted her . I asked Asha to get me a glass of water from one of the clay pots in the corner of the room . When she brought it , I held up the pills I must take every morning and asked , " Do you know what these are ? " " Medicine , Nanaji . " " Yes , but they are of three different kinds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifting the orange one with my thumb and forefinger . " It makes me get rid of a lot of water so that my heart does n't have so much to move . This one " I pointed to the aspirin " thins my blood , and that also means my heart works less . And this one , " I said , referring to the blue one with a cross etched on it , " is called a beta blocker . " I said beta blocker twice because it sounded dramatic . " This keeps my heart from getting excited . " I had not meant to start the explanation , but the quick self-pity and anger it evoked made me realize guilt was irritating me . I continued talking and the feelings eased . I was glad I had found an opportunity to reveal some part of my life , because it would make my asking Asha questions feel more natural . I held the pills out for a moment and then swept them into my mouth . Asha wandered to the living room and turned on the television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more slowly , so that it took her ten minutes to put her books in their bag . Asha was taking classes in May , even though most schools were closed , because she had missed many days when her father died . Rosary was one of the few schools that had government approval for a summer program and that was why I had had her admitted there . I went into the living room to watch the television news . Eventually Asha shuffled into the bedroom she and Anita shared . Through the doorway I saw her putting on white ankle-length socks and small black shoes . At a quarter past eight , she slung a satchel full of books around one shoulder and came to her mother in the kitchen to say goodbye . Anita kissed both of Asha 's hands and her forehead . I saw this from my room , where I was dressing , and felt sad and guilty again . The first anniversary of Radha 's death was in two days . Half an hour later , when I left for the office , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedroom . She had a fold of her sari over her head and held it in place by biting it . The bed she and Asha sleep on almost completely fills the room . Flies were switching about . The sight of Anita kneeling and the formality and shyness of the covered head made me think of how badly I had used my life . " Talk to the pundit , " Anita said , looking up at me . I had yet to arrange the pundit for Radha 's prayers . Although Anita had told me to do this several times over the week , there was nothing accusatory in her voice . Suddenly I was angry . I glared at her , until she turned her head down . Then I said , " Why are you always covering your head ? You are n't at your in-laws ' . People will think you 're afraid of me. "
