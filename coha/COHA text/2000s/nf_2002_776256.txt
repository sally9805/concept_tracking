Death has a way of making even slow people hurry . It scares them into seeing things the way they are , instead of the way they wish them to be . Even small deaths people do n't expect to notice , or welcome deaths , which end hard-luck lives or long , painful illnesses , sweep mourners backwards through rooms they have been avoiding for years . So when the black community in Jasper , Texas , awoke one Sunday morning to hear one of its own had been killed in some awful way on Huff Creek Road , the phones began to ring . Ladies who had come to church early , ahead of the Sunday services , abandoned the hymnals in messy stacks and began counting noses . They called relatives , and friends , and friends of friends to see if their men were home , safe , or whether it might be one of their kin dumped on the side of an old timber road . // It was a little after nine a.m. when Sheriff Billy Rowles received the call from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine hit-and-run-a commonplace accident on the unlit roads on the outskirts of town . // Deputy Joe Sterling , a baby-faced officer , had come on the line a little breathless . // " It 's a bad one , Sheriff .
