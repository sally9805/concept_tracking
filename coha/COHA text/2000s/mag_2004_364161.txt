In a recent episode of the hit TV show The Apprentice , Donald Trump challenged a gaggle of fawning dealmaker wannabes to boost revenue at his Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City , N.J. Eager to impress , Trump 's pupils got right to work . But they might have just as quickly asked , Who the heck is Trump to judge ? After all , his casino empire has been losing money for years . <P> So much money , it was revealed last week , that auditing firm Ernst &; Young warned of " substantial doubt " that the publicly traded gaming company run by Trump Hotels &; Casino Resorts could continue as a viable enterprise . The prospect of a flashy failure could tousle the Donald 's carefully coiffed image as a business guru . Fighting back , he declared last week that his casinos " have always been a good company " and that he will prove it by focusing on them until they are fixed . <P> Trump 's forte is brand building , and he is the brand , the Martha of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Saturday Night Live and last week unveiled Trump Visa , which rewards cardholders with casino discounts . There is now Trump Ice bottled water and a hot-selling book , How to Get Rich . Publicity , in other words , is his strength . <P> But can he run a business ? Trump Hotels ' shareholders have concerns . " I do n't think he knows a thing about running the casinos , " asserts Marvin Roffman , an analyst and longtime Trump critic at the investment firm Roffman Miller . The cash-starved casinos are run down and have been losing customers to newer outfits like the Borgata Hotel Casino &; Spa , which opened last year . Since selling initial shares to the public in 1995 , Trump Hotels has never recorded an annual profit and the stock has fallen 84% . If Trump gets the deal he wants to recapitalize the company , existing shareholders may get wiped out . <P> Trump is asking investors , who hold $1.8 billion in bonds , for a lower interest rate and what amounts to some debt forgiveness in return for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlling stake but would stick around in a high-profile role to promote the casinos . The key is a proposed $400 million investment by Credit Suisse First Boston , which would then own most of the company . Trump says he will use the infusion to pay off debt and reinvest in the properties . Some of Trump Hotels ' bondholders are furious at the request to restructure the debt and may opt for bankruptcy if Trump pushes too hard . Just a year ago , they bailed him out of a cash crunch by buying a new round of bonds . <P> But Trump may get most of what he wants anyway  --  not because of his managerial acumen but because the brand he has promoted so tirelessly is a key asset . " His name has cachet , " says Kim Noland , debt analyst at Gim me Credit newsletter . " That might actually help with customer count . " Trump is a tough negotiator too . He knows from experience that when you owe billions , the creditors are in just as much trouble as you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outsize ego could no doubt handle the potential Atlantic City bankruptcy , and his stake in the casino properties is , he says , only about 1% of his net worth .
