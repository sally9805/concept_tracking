In knitting , as in life , we grow when we challenge ourselves . The concentration required to learn a new stitch or technique is good for both our hands and our brains . <p>  --  Bev Galeskas , Fiber Trends Patterns and U.S. distributor of Naturally New Zealand Yarns . <p> www.fibertrends.com <p> Lydia Goetz <p> Wednesday morning , a not-so-perfect June day , I turned over the Open sign at my yarn store on Blossom Street . Standing in the doorway I breathed in the sweet scent of day lilies , gladiolas , roses and lavender from Susannah 's Garden , the flower shop next door . <p> It was the beginning of summer , and although the sky was overcast and rain threatened to fall at any moment , the sun shone brightly in my heart . ( My husband , Brad , always laughs when I say things like that . But I do n't care . As a woman who 's survived cancer not once but twice , I feel entitled to the occasional sentimental remark . Especially today ) <p> I took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace . I just do n't think there 's anyplace more beautiful than Seattle in the summer . All the flowers spilling out of Susannah 's Garden are one of the benefits . The array of colors , as well as the heady perfume drifting in my direction , makes me so glad A Good Yarn is located where it is . <p> Whiskers , my shop cat , as Brad calls him , ambled across the hardwood floor and leaped into the window display , nestling among the skeins of pastel yarns . He takes up residence there most days and has long been a neighborhood favorite . The apartment upstairs is an extra storeroom for yarn at the moment ; perhaps one day I 'll rent it out again but that is n't in the plans yet . <p> The French CafT across the street was already busy , as it is every morning . The windows were filled with pastries , breads and croissants warm from the oven , and their delectable aroma added to the scents I associate with summer on Blossom Street . Alix Turner is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temptations . She 's one of my dearest friends  --  and was among my first customers . I 'm so proud of everything she 's accomplished in the past few years . It 's fair to say she reinvented her life  --  with a little help from her friends . She has an education and a career now , and she 's married to a man who seems completely right for her . <p> Blossom Street Books down the street was ready for business , too . Anne Marie Roche and her staff often leave the front door open as a welcoming gesture , inviting those who wander past to come inside and browse . She and her daughter , Ellen , would be coming home from Paris later today . <p> Nearly every afternoon Ellen walks their Yorkie past the window so Whiskers and Baxter can stare fiercely at each other . Ellen insists it 's all for show , that the cat and dog are actually good friends but do n't want any of us to know that . <p> I grinned at Whiskers because I could n't resist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , I wanted to tell the whole world my news . Yesterday , we found out that we 'd been approved for adoption . I had n't yet shared this information with anyone , including my sister , Margaret . We 've been through the interviews , the home test and fingerprinting . And last night we heard . <p> We 're going to adopt a baby . <p> Because of my cancer , pregnancy is out of the question . While the ability to conceive has been taken from me , the desire for a baby has n't . It 's like an ache that never quite goes away . As much as possible I 've tried to hide this from Brad . Whenever thoughts of what cancer has stolen from me enter my head , I try hard to counter them by remembering all the blessings I 've received in my life . I want to celebrate every day , savor every minute , without resentment or regret . <p> I have so much for which to be grateful . I 'm alive and cancer-free . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , Cody , now nine years old , has become my son , too . And I have a successful business , one that brings me great pleasure and satisfaction . When I first opened A Good Yarn , it was my way of shouting to the world that I refused to let cancer rob me of anything else . I was going to live and I was going to do it without the constant threat of illness and death . I was determined to bask in the sunshine . I still am . <p> So A Good Yarn was the start of my new life . Within a year of opening the store , I met Brad Goetz and we were married the following spring . Because of what I 'd been through in my teens and again in my twenties , I did n't have a lot of experience with men or relationships . At first , Brad 's love terrified me . Then I learned not to reject something good just because I was afraid of its loss . I learned that I could trust this man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be loved by him and Cody . Each and every day I thank God for the two men in my life . <p> Even with all I have , my arms ached to hold a baby . Our baby . Brad , who knows me so well , understood my need . After discussing the subject for weeks on end , after vacillating , weighing the pros and cons , we 'd reached our decision . <p> Yes , we were going to adopt . <p> The catalyst for all this happened when Anne Marie Roche adopted eight-year-old Ellen . <p> I realized the wait for a newborn might be lengthy but we were both prepared for that . Although we 'd be thrilled with an infant of either sex , I secretly longed for a little girl . <p> I heard the back door close and turned to see my sister , Margaret . She 's worked with me almost from the first day I opened the shop . Although we 're as different as any two sisters could be , we 've become close . Margaret is a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think I balance her , too , since I 'm much more optimistic and given to occasional whimsy . <p> " Good morning ! " I greeted her cheerfully , unable to disguise my happiness . <p> " It 's going to pour , " she muttered , taking off her raincoat and hanging it in the back storeroom . <p> My sister tends to see the negative . The glass would always be half-empty to Margaret . Or completely empty  --  if not shattered on the floor . Over the years I 've grown accustomed to her attitude and simply ignore it . <p> When she 'd finished removing her coat , Margaret stared at me , then frowned . " Why are you so happy ? " she demanded . " Anybody can see we 're about to have a downpour . " <p> " Me ? Happy ? " There was n't much point in trying to hold back my news , even though I knew Margaret was the one person who would n't understand my pleasure . She 'd disapprove and would have no qualms about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose , and the fact that she worries about me , although she 'd never admit that . <p> Margaret continued to glare . " You 're grinning from ear to ear . " <p> I made busy work at the cash register in order to avoid eye contact . I might as well tell her , although I dreaded her response . " Brad and I have applied for adoption , " I blurted out , unable to stop myself . " And our application 's been accepted . " <p> A startled silence followed . <p> " I know you think we 're making a mistake , " I rushed to add . <p> " I did n't say that . " Margaret walked slowly toward me . <p> " You did n't need to say anything , " I told her . Just once I wanted Margaret to be happy for me , without doubts and objections and concerns . " Your silence said it all . " <p> Margaret joined me at the counter next to the cash register . She seemed to sense that her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if adoption 's a wise choice for you . " <p> " Margaret , " I began , sighing as I spoke . " Brad and I know what we 're doing . " Although Margaret had n't said it openly , I could guess what concerned her most . She was afraid the cancer would return . I 'm well aware of the possibility and have been ever since its recurrence ten years ago . It was a serious consideration and one that neither Brad nor I took lightly . <p> " Brad agrees ? " My sister sounded skeptical . <p> " Of course he agrees ! I 'd never go against his wishes . " <p> Margaret still did n't look convinced . " You 're sure this is what you want ? " <p> " Yes . " I was adamant . Sometimes that 's the only way to reach her . " Brad knows the risks as well as I do . You do n't need to spell it out , Margaret . I understand why you 're afraid for me , but I 'm through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed her apprehensions . She studied me and after a moment asked , " What if the adoption agency does n't find you a child ? " <p> This was something Brad and I had discussed and it could certainly happen . I shrugged . " Nothing ventured , nothing gained . We 'll take the chance . " <p> " You want an infant ? " <p> " Yes . " I pictured a newborn , wrapped in a soft pink blanket , gently placed in my waiting arms . I held on to the image , allowing it to bring me comfort , to fill me with hope . <p> To my surprise Margaret did n't immediately voice another objection . After a thoughtful minute or two , she said in low tones , " You 'd be a good mother you already are . " <p> I 'm sure my jaw fell open . The shock of Margaret 's endorsement was almost more than I could take in . This was as close as Margaret had ever come to bestowing her approval on anything regarding my personal life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been partially responsible for Brad and me getting back together when I 'd pushed him away  --  a reconciliation that led directly to our marriage . <p> " Thank you , " I whispered and touched her arm . <p> Margaret made some gruff , unintelligible reply and moved to the table at the back of the store . She pulled out a chair , sat down and took out her crocheting . <p> " I put up the poster you made for our new class , " I told her , doing my best to conceal the emotion that crept into my voice . The last thing I 'd expected from Margaret had been her blessing , and I was deeply touched by her words . <p> She acknowledged my comment with a nod . <br> Continues ...
