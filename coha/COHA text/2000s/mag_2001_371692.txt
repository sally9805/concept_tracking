When the Taliban imposed a regime of rigid religious joylessness in 1996 , Afghans buried their outlawed televisions in the hope that they would one day tune in again . Last week , as the locals in Kabul were enjoying their Sonys , Taliban soldiers who had surrendered there and in Kunduz , Mazar-i-Sharif and other cities were , in a manner of speaking , burying their AK-47s for later use . <P> But what kind of use ? And on whose behalf ? <P> In Afghanistan , where loyalty is fungible , accounting for the numbers in the Taliban grew more complicated during last week 's flurry of surrenders and swapped allegiances . Those who marched under its banner have recalculated their loyalty based on tribal and ethnic alliances , their zeal for Islam and their desire to see another day . " People feel the Taliban messed things up . Their popular support is gone , " says a Pakistani official . <P> And so , for now , are many of their fighters  --  conscripts , true believers , and opportunists who followed their warlords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers  --  not including the 10,000 or so foreigners  --  who called themselves Taliban members have turned in their black turbans . " The Taliban are still there . They have just changed sides , " says Abdul Rub , 41 , a former Afghan mujahid who is now based in Peshawar , Pakistan . Anti-Taliban Pashtun forces in the south number at least 10,000 and are growing . Northern Alliance armies have doubled in size , to 40,000 . <P> Many Taliban fighters have followed the path of defeated soldiers before them and gone home . Thousands are thought to have fled across the porous border to Pakistan . " Most Taliban leaders are now in Pakistan , " says Mohammed Naeem Safai , former Taliban director of information . Safai snuck across the border , and is now in a refugee camp outside Peshawar . " The day the U.S. stops bombing , the Taliban will come back , " he says . <P> There are still pockets of resistance . Mullah Dadullah , a top Taliban commander in Kunduz before it fell , has resurfaced in Balkh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commander Amir Jaan  --  who switched sides in September  --  is sheltering him , some senior Taliban figures and between 400 and 500 soldiers . <P> Even by the most conservative figures , the Taliban had 5,000 men in Mazar before it fell and 12,000 in Kunduz , many of whom arrived after fleeing Mazar . Subtract the dead and the POWs , and there are at least 8,000 unaccounted for . In Mazar , thousands of former Taliban members have returned . They have not been welcomed back by wary Mazaris . Indeed , fears of a resurgence have made the Alliance cautious , and at least 2,400 Taliban , mostly Pashtun and foreigners , have been detained . In Taloqan , Noor Mohammad , 20 , a Pashtun , says he was given a gun by the Taliban leadership in Kunduz just one week before . When his commander defected , " I threw away the gun and then cut off my beard . All I want to do is look after my family , " he says from a Taloqan jail . <P> That wo n't be possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and at least 1,000 Taliban soldiers , including many foreigners , were wiped out by Northern Alliance forces in Mazar and Kunduz . Hundreds more perished elsewhere .
