1 . Georgetown , Great Exuma . <p> Two o'clock on a Sunday afternoon in the Chat and Chill Bar on Stocking Island . KB , the Bahamian who owns the place , is looking for an argument and ca n't find one . Mandela versus Boutelayzee , University of Chicago versus Harvard , chanterelles versus portabellas . Even Mushroom John , who brought his wife , Sandy , down here from their tuber farm in Pennsylvania for their twenty-fifth wedding anniversary , says the rule is to each his own . Down the beach Junior is making the best conch salad on the island , conch so fresh it is still wiggling when he puts it down in front of us . I drink two Goombay smashes to Cory 's five Kalik beers , and after some critical mass of mosquito bites we tumble outside to hit the blue , blue water . I told Cory there was no blue like Exuma blue before we came , and now he says , " It 's so pretty , it 's corny . " <p> They call this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they like to say , for every day of the year , and it 's true , even the teenage boys with their skullcaps and their hooded eyes feel compelled to say hello when they pass us on the street . At the Peace and Plenty hotel , Kaliks cost three dollars , but there is a reggae band at Eddie 's Edgewater club on Fridays , and if you go to the kitchen door and smile politely , old Mrs. Beatrice Goodnight will give you fried chicken and peas and rice wrapped in the Sunday paper with salt . <p> Every Sunday at the Chat and Chill , KB roasts a pig , we can smell it where we 're floating , you can smell it all over the island when the wind is onshore . A stingray floats across the white sand below our floating bodies , and a little school of sergeant majors mistake the yellow in my bathing suit for one of their own . The floating is so effortless , the sun so soft and warm , I 'm almost asleep when Junior hollers that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eat them , roll them around in the red sauce that has just the right amount of kick to it , get in one more swim before it 's time to eat the pig . <p> 2 . Davis , California . <p> Early morning on the greenbelt . Walking with Lucy , while Audrey leaps between furrowed , fallow fields . Everyone we know calls Lucy Audrey and Audrey Lucy , which is strange since Lucy is a thirty-five-year-old woman , and Audrey is a German shorthaired pointer , but when you see the way they look at each other , you begin to understand . Lucy has her sister 's name-Emily-tattooed across her bicep . Last month , Emily tried to kill herself , succeeded , temporarily , was gone , in almost every way that counts , for more than two whole days . Then she came back from the dead . <p> Last night I heard a nightingale imitating a car alarm in a jacaranda tree . This morning , a white heron teases Audrey with a touch-and-go pattern along the creek . I remember the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Limantour Beach after the storm and watched the pelicans . The storm had brought out all the animals , tule elk , fallow deer , and three coyotes who ran and leapt and did the kinds of things coyotes do in Native American sand paintings , while we watched , open-mouthed , from the side of the road . We saw so much wildlife that day Murray finally asked if I 'd sent a guy ahead of us to push animals out of boxes . We were each locked inside our individual sorrows , did n't know each other well enough to share , but we agreed , out loud , that like moose , pelicans were surely put on earth to act as suicide preventers , agreed we 'd never kill ourselves within the sight of one . <p> 3 . Ozona , Texas . <p> Nine o'clock on a Thursday night , the bar full of Halliburton guys in their red all-in-one suits , roughnecks in from the oil fields for preseason football , hunting stories , and beer . It is just dumb luck that I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat in the house for watching the Patriots beat up on the Redskins , until the bartender comes over and tells us we 've entered a private club . Gory rises to leave . He recognizes enemy territory , knows that poets and Halliburton guys should n't drink together , especially not in Texas . " In that case , " I say , " I 'll take two memberships and two double shots of Patron Silver and a Coca-Cola back . " <p> We can mark this down as my last fearless moment because even though I 've already seen the Albanian 's pictures in the glove box , I have n't really let her sink in . She 's married to a high-ranking political official . Every time Gory goes over there to visit her , someone comes up to him in a trench coat and says , " You know the price of a man in Albania is one hundred dollars U.S. " <p> I tell him with a straight face that the Albanian 's essential unavailability denies me all my magical qualities ; then I ask him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars , and I play every antiwar song I can find wedged in between Glint Black and the If You Do n't Believe in Freedom We 'll Kick Your Fuckin ' Ass Quintet : " Who 'll Stop the Rain , " and " Imagine , " and " War , Good God , ya 'll , what is it good for , absolutely nothing , say it again . " By the third round of Silver we 've won the bartender over , we can tell because the tequila starts coming in tumblers . <p> Gory says , " You might be the first woman to ever drink in this bar , " and I say , " You might be the first poet . " Later , in the parking lot of the Best Western , I pick up both our heavy suitcases and make a beeline for the stairs . Gory says , " No ! Pam , no ! " which makes me lift the bags higher and run for it , and when I get to the top I laugh so hard I pee . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't see any orcas . They said the humpbacks were in and when the humpbacks were in you did n't see the orcas , because the orcas are predators and the humpbacks are prey . It 's been a long day . We 've been all the way up Tracy Arm to the glaciers , and everyone but the captain and I are sleeping when a report comes over the radio : orcas in Shearwater Cove . <p> By the time we get there , there 's nothing stirring . A couple of humpbacks out in the main channel a sure sign that the orcas are gone . The captain is worried about the hour , worried about the fuel he 's got left , worried about his daughter , who 's got magenta hair and a T-shirt that says THIS is what a feminist looks like , who is back from somewhere like Reed College working on his boat this summer , selling sodas to the tourists through a permanent scowl . There is a flash of fin on the other side of the channel , distant , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " That 's four miles across this channel , minimum . " I show him the silver charm around my neck , remind him that it 's my last day in Alaska , promise to swim for shore if we run out of gas . <p> " Do n't lose that fin , " he says , turning the bow into the sunset , but I could n't lose it if I tried , the water of Stephen 's Passage backlit , a million diamonds rushing toward me in the sun , and one black fin , impossibly tall , absurdly geometric , the accompanying blast of whale breath above it , superimposed onto the patterns of light . <p> Spotting whales at sea is not so different than spotting deer in the woods . For hours you see nothing , and then you see one , and suddenly you realize you are surrounded . This pod has twentyfive , by my best counting , the one male , who keeps his distance , and twenty-four females , all of them running steadily west . We get out in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the big male 's fin turns itself up and over and back down under the surface of the water , I ca n't help myself , I gasp . <p> We are directly in the path of one of the females . Every time she surfaces we can hear her breathing , every time she surfaces I can see the spot of white at her heart , the patch on an orca that takes a black whale and turns it into something else . Twenty years ago , on my first trip to Alaska , I bought a string of white heart trade beads , and for this trip I tore the house apart to find them . <p> In three more dives she 'll be under the boat . I touch the beads at my neck and try to guess which side of the boat will get me the closest . The others are stirring , crowding the port side , watching her approach . I choose starboard , she dives one last time , and I start counting , at five she rises right under my hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If I dared I could reach down and touch her on her white spot . Someone behind me screams , maybe the captain 's daughter , but the whale is already diving , already resurfacing a few yards farther on . I listen to the sweep of her fin , the puff of her breathing , until she disappears into the disappearing diamonds . When the male 's big fin is the only thing visible-a speck on the horizon , we turn the boat north and head for home . <p> 5 . Good Hope , Jamaica . <p> The sun is high above the cockpit country , and Marc and I are getting stoned at the pool . I am way too old to smoke pot , but Marc is n't , and he convinces me , you would n't go to Italy and not drink the coffee , you do n't go to Jamaica without smoking the weed . And he 's right . This pot is so potent that every time the sun reemerges from behind the cotton-ball clouds , I think a cartoon character I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby-powdered hands . <p> Marc 's brother died in a car accident when Marc was eighteen . Four months later he was the one to walk in on the body of his mother . Four months later his father went to jail . For the five years after that Marc played Division I hockey , turned his entire focus toward protecting the 4 ' ? 6 ' space behind him , dodging the pucks that were continually flying at his head . Then his goalie knees gave out , and the next logical thing was to try to become a writer . <p> Good Hope is a papaya plantation that for a few weeks a year turns itself over to the making of art . Last night the ceramicists pulled an all-nighter to fire up the big wooden kiln , and the writers decided to stay up with them . It was quite a party , writers throwing pots , potters writing pantoums , the big clay figures glowing crimson inside the house-sized kiln like bodies , the oncologist from Santa Fe unable to resist a recitation of " The Cremation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tear around the world this year , Iceland , Finland , Amsterdam , Jamaica . After this he is supposed to go see his brother 's grave for the first time since his family blew up-his expression-and even to talk about it makes him shake in his chair . " You do n't have to do that if you are n't ready , " I tell him . " Your brother is with you every second ; it does n't make any difference to him whether or not you stand at his grave . " The sun moves out of the clouds again , turning the flowers a purple I thought existed only in coral reefs and crayons . <p> " You 're right , " he says . " Thank you , " though we do n't fool each other for a second , and that 's how we know we are friends . <p> 6 . Creede , Colorado . <p> The first snow fell on the peaks today . An edgy wind brought clouds that looked like thunderheads , but when they cleared , just before sunset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in white , but in chrome . Gory is in Tampa this balmy midnight , sitting on his front porch surrounded by chirping lizards , writing a poem by the glow of a string of Christmas lights , the paper curling at the edges , his hand damp where he holds the pen . I have only recently come back to this place of ice-colored stars strewn across ink dark sky , where frost on the wooden walkway is likely every night of the year-and heavy tonight-where I scare up a barn owl traveling the short hundred yards between my door and my car , and his wing beat is the loudest sound for ten square miles . The owl stops me in my tracks , makes me take a breath of the cold night air , and when I do , I think , I am breathing in the stars . <p> Yesterday I walked with six of the best women I know up above Spring Creek Pass to the twelve-thousand-foot flat top called Jarosa Mesa . Our ages span twenty years , 34-54 , and what we have in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes us edgy . The aspens near the pass are holding their breath this week , hints of yellow and crimson , the meadow grasses high after August 's monsoon . We talk about Myanmar , Cuba , and New Orleans . We talk about stepchildren , wind pants , Italian food , sex . We snack on the season 's first good clmentines and raspberry Fig Newman 's . To the west of the mesa the i4ers lay themselves out before us , a multi-colored kingdom of stone : Handles Peak , Sunshine Peak , Redstone Peak , The Wetterhorn , and Uncompaghre . <p> If I died tonight it would be with every single thing unfinished ( like , I suppose , any other night ) , and yet , what a gift to die on the verge of tears . I have spent my life trying to understand the way this rock and this ache go together , why a granite peak is more dramatic half dressed in clouds ( like a woman ) , why sunlight under fog is better than the sum of its parts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same days , why ( often ) leaving seems like the only solution to the predicament of loving ( each other ) the world . <p> It 's hard to know whether the bigger problem is space or time . The forty-three years I did n't get to miss him , the unlimited renta-car miles between Tampa and anywhere he could really see the stars . All the way across the I-io last month , the sky kept making him offers : thunderclouds over Flagstaff , a double rainbow near Tucumcari , and Mars , the closest to the earth in fifty thousand years , burning candy-apple red and following the moon from Albuquerque to Gallup , and we went the other way-the wrong way , any given star would tell you-hurtling west to east . <p> 7 . Vancouver , British Columbia . <p> The bipolar halibut fisherman from Kodiak with ocean eyes and biceps like something right out of Michelangelo . He 's spent ten years in Jo-burg , ten years in Bangkok , ten years back and forth between Kodiak and B.C. As a result , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter h , and anything with a lot of r 's in it . <p> He tells me he does n't like to throw around words like CIA and Special Forces . He tells me we 've been put on earth to crack each other open , and then to stick around long enough to watch the thing that , having been cracked open , suddenly shines . He says he knows there is only a thin wall between himself and all that shining , but sometimes he forgets how thin the wall is , because somebody came along when he was n't looking , and painted the damn thing black . He tells me he has tried three different times , but he just ca n't stick with the lithium . Even when he talks about not wanting to use his powers for world domination , even when he uses the phrase dark arts , he looks like a little boy who wants more than anything to catch a fish . <p> When I tell my friend Fenton about him , Fenton hears Kodiak , hears fisherman , hears bi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I remind Fenton about Gory , he reminds me about the Albanian in the glove box . " Love gets bigger after forty , " Fenton tells me . " After forty , love says , Come one , come all . " <p> 8 . Laramie , Wyoming . <p> In the summer , the trains come through town more than once an hour , and Gory and I , locked all night in the bookstore like a fantasy left over from clumsy childhood , pulling books off whatever shelves we want to and reading to each other-poems first , and then settling into stories-on the old purple couch . We 'd come down that day from Walden , Moose Capital of Colorado . I was sure we would find some marker on the fence where Matthew Shepard had been tied . <p> Later , when we had turned out all the lights in the bookstore and thrown the mattress on the floor in the back room , the cowboy band across the street tried to play " Free Bird " as an encore , and I watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He took my hand and made me feel the place we came together . <p> " Holy , " he said , not believing in God . <p> 9 . Tucson , Arizona . <p> Drinking espresso on the patio of Raging Sage , waiting for the phone to ring . Tami had her needle biopsy last Thursday , is expecting results today . She is the same age now that her mother was when she was first diagnosed with breast cancer . <p> After the news , good or bad , we are going to the spa for Watsu , where a large and beautiful woman named Shannon will float us around a pool one at a time , twist us and turn us , all the time supporting us , pull us tight against her shoulder , her arms snug under our butts , and rock us into something like sleep . <p> In the car on the way home , after the first Watsu , Tami said , " So did that kind of freak you out when she held you like a baby ? " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the road . Now we ca n't get enough of Shannon and the way she holds us like a baby . Both of our mothers have been dead a long time . <p> The only good thing about finding the Albanian in the glove box was looking forward to telling Tami that in the ensuing fight I had referenced my own magical qualities . I told her what Gory told me , that after sex in the missionary position-the Albanian wo n't let Cory do anything her husband does n't do-the Albanian runs around the hotel room screaming , I 'm a motel whore , I 'm a motel whore . That 's when Tami started calling him the stupid fucking poet who wo n't get out of his own stupid fucking way . " SFP , " Tami said , " like sunscreen , after forty-five it 's all the same . " <p> Bluetail lizards chase each other back and forth across the patio . <p> I say , " What was the best piece of advice your mother ever gave you ? " <p> Tami thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dixon and I had our first big fight , " she says . " Valentine 's Day , 1994 . I did n't think we were going to make it . I called Mom out of desperation . ' Honey , ' she said , ' can I just ask you one question ? You know when you are having your period ? Are you giving Dixon enough blow jobs during those times ? ' " <p> Tami 's cellphone rings , and we both stare at it a minute before she answers . She picks it up , and I start counting inside my head , and when I get to seven , relief breaks across Tami 's face like sunshine . I realize with some surprise that I am paralyzed with gratitude . If this building were on fire , I could not use my legs to move away . <p> 10 . Gulfport , Mississippi . <p> Cory and I walk out on the pier to watch the pelicans dive . On the way back we pass a young man in a wheelchair . He is smoking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a paper bag . He is sunken in on himself in the particular way of the dying , but has a look of such despair on his face I know that in that way , at least , he is still very much alive . <p> Cory does n't notice his ball cap , brown corduroy , the word Worthy embroidered in cursive , in gold . It takes us ten minutes to gather the courage to go back up the pier and talk to him . From a hundred yards away , he watches us in our deliberations . Gory and I can never decide anything , where to go to dinner , whether or not to stay together , what to do about the Albanian in the glove box . By the time we get the courage to go to him , to ask him in quiet nervous voices if there is anything we can do for him , he feels equally sorry for us . <p> 11 . Madison , Wisconsin . <p> Saturday morning , middle of October . Good strong coffee from Michelangelo 's . Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my voicemail , and I did , and for the first time this week , slept for six hours straight . This morning on State Street a little blond girl-maybe three-threw the kind of temper tantrum we 'd all like to throw , long and loud , and almost entirely artificial . " Jessica , " her mother said , in a perfectly reasonable tone , " Jessica , I 'm going to have to ask you for your complete cooperation ... " <p> Fenton called to say he has come up with the perfect book for us to write together , Patn and Fenton 's Tales of Failed Love and Romance . Chapter one , mine , called I Ca n't Believe I Slept with a Poet , followed by chapter two , his , I Ca n't Believe I Slept with a Priest . <p> Everything I know about Wisconsin can fit in one paragraph . It is the home of the Butter Burger . It is the state where , on the day that his father died , Brett Farve had the game of his life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write your own suicide note . There was half a beat where they all looked at me , and then each other . " No problem , " Murray finally said . " I 'll just go to computer and call one up . " <p> 12 . Tampa , Florida . <p> Eight o'clock on a Friday night , and downtown is rolled up tight . Haifa block from the old Tampa Theater , lights , voices , and the slow roll of reggae spilling out into the street . Gory and I have been having a hard time finding fun in Tampa , and the Jamaicans at the Jerk Hut seem to be having some . It has the feel of a private party , and no one else there is white , but the bouncer says five bucks a person cover , twelve for a bucket of Red Stripes , you can get yourself some food in the back . <p> We fill a plate with jerk chicken and fried bananas , open two beers , and settle in on the perimeter . The band is talented , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even though Cory keeps trying to bend the lyrics political , all the lines I catch are about love and sex and girls . Cory is not a dancer , but the beat is irresistible , so I compromise , as others do , by swaying in my chair . When we are not ignored entirely , we are looked at with pleasant curiosity . <p> Earlier that day , I was trying to buy some grouper somewhere other than a supermarket , and the woman at the Born Again Produce stand sent me to the Fresh Fish Market in the projects . " It 's crazy , " she said . " Water , water everywhere , but that 's the only one there is . " <p> The Fresh Fish Market is in a strip mall . Next door at the Joyful Noise Holiness Tabernacle of Jesus Christ , teenage girls in white and purple robes holding hymnals were lining up to go inside . There was only one grouper fillet left in the case , and the woman behind me in line said she wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile so wide it showered the dingy market walls with light . " Sister got lost on the way to the Publix , " she said . <p> Back at the Jerk Hut , the band is on break , and Cory says , " We might be the only white people to ever drink in this bar . " And I say , " And you might be the only poet . " <p> I 'm finally beginning to understand , that when we want to kill ourselves , it is not because we are lonely , but because we are trying to break up with the world before the world breaks up with us . <p> When the band comes back , a waitress named Shaila with beaded dreadlocks and bright green pumps takes both my hands and pulls me to the dance floor . She says , " We are going to get everybody dancing tonight . " Two songs later she says , " I 'm going back to get the Mister , " and I know Gory wo n't be able to resist her invitation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two songs later , Shaila gets her wish . Every single person-even the bouncer , even the kitchen ladies-are dancing , joyful , to the beat . <p> Author Affiliation
