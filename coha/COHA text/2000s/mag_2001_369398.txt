The first shots rang out just after 1 p.m . Laurent-Desire Kabila , 61 , President of the Democratic Republic of Congo , was in heated discussion with advisers inside the presidential palace in the capital of Kinshasa . Details of what happened next remain sketchy . One version is that a bodyguard drew the President aside and then shot him twice . Another is that a minister shot the President after Kabila ordered his arrest . In any event , shooting continued for about 30 minutes . Soon after , presidential chief of staff Eddy Kapend went on state television to appeal for calm and announce the temporary closure of the country 's borders . As Kapend spoke , Kabila was being loaded onto a plane for Harare , the capital of Zimbabwe . Kinshasa , a normally chaotic city of 5 million people , grew eerily calm . Within hours , reports from Belgium , the D.R.C. 's former colonial ruler , and the U.S. said Kabila had been killed . <P> His death was officially announced two days later after a farcical series of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's alive " declarations and denials  --  drawn out , most likely , as various government factions fought over who should succeed him . American officials say they think the shooting was the result of an internal power struggle , a by-product of the country 's bloody civil war . Some African analysts finger the Angolans , who were frustrated with Kabila 's leadership . There was a glimmer of hope in the news : Western diplomats think Kabila 's death may encourage the warring factions to seek peace . <P> Much of that will depend on Kabila 's eldest son , Major General Joseph Kabila , 31 , who should be sworn in as President this week . A shy nonsmoker and teetotaler , Joseph is unpopular with many Congolese . He grew up in East Africa during his father 's rebel days and reportedly prefers English and Kiswahili to French and Lingala , the most widely spoken Congolese language . Joseph takes charge of a country in name only . The war that began as a rebellion in the east of the country in August 1998 quickly became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had supported Kabila pere in his campaign to end the reign of Mobutu Sese Seko , backed the rebellion after falling out with Kabila . Angola , Namibia and Zimbabwe supported the Congolese President in return for the promise of lucrative oil and mining concessions . A peace accord signed 18 months ago by the main protagonists called for a cease-fire , but fighting has dragged on . <P> Caught in the war 's grip are 51 million Congolese . The International Rescue Committee , a group based in New York City that helps people fleeing war and violence , estimates that in the 30 months since the war broke out , more than 2 million people have died as a result of fighting , most of them from preventable diseases and malnutrition . At least a third of the deaths have been children under five . Kabila 's death last week may have got the most headlines , but it is not the country 's first war-related casualty , and it is unlikely to be the last . <P>  --  By Simon Robinson .
