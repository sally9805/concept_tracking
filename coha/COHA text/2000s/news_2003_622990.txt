<p> Do n't look back , Mammoth . Heavenly may be gaining on you . <p> Fueled by major development bucks from its new owner , Heavenly is eager to snare more market share by enhancing amenities and visitor services all over its mountain . <p> Mammoth , a competing resort situated east of the Sierra crest near Yosemite , has long held the California title for the most annual skier/snowboarder visits . With its 3,500 skiable acres served by 27 lifts , three terrain parks and 11,000-foot summit commonly buried in dry , high desert snow , Mammoth draws most of its 1.1 million guests from the teeming cities of Southern California . <p> The resort 's major handicap  --  its sheer remoteness  --  soon will be licked by the expansion of the Mammoth airport . <p> Heavenly , on the south shore of Lake Tahoe , does n't trail far behind Mammoth in popularity  --  about 950,000 annual visits . Heavenly claims to have 4,800 skiable acres sprawled across the California/Nevada border , with 29 lifts , three terrain parks , a 10,000-foot summit and extensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a dearth of development capital , was abruptly cured last May . Heavenly was purchased by Vail Resorts from the previous owner , the faltering American Ski Company ( ASC ) . Vail Resorts operates Beaver Creek , Keystone , Breckenridge and Vail ski areas in Colorado , and also owns a rapidly swelling number of non-ski hotels . Vail 's corporate stock has slid in recent months , but the firm still generates a mighty cash stream , handling gross revenues in excess of $600 million per year . <p> " We think growing at Heavenly will be easy , " said Vail CEO and chairman Adam Aron , when he made the purchase announcement last spring . He pledged to spend $40 million in capital improvements at Heavenly over the next five years . " If we upgrade facilities and services , we think customers will respond and come in even greater numbers . " <p> Said and done . Early results are visible . In the few short months prior to the start of this ski season , Heavenly whipped through a remodel and upgrade of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Food service , ticket processing and ambience are all improved . One of the few old decor items left is a stuffed grizzly bear above the bar  --  and he enjoyed a fluff , rinse and makeover from a taxidermist . <p> " We spent about $5.5 million in four months , " said Heavenly 's vice-president of marketing and sales , John Wagnon . " Besides revamping the California lodge and the Stagecoach lodge on the Nevada side , we streamlined the ticketing process , changed our operating systems and put fresh emphasis on customer service . <p> " Still to come are new , mid-mountain lodges at East Peak , at the top of the Gondola , and a new one at Sky Deck on the California side . We want to put in at least three new high-capacity lifts . One to improve North Bowl access from the Boulder base ; one to replace Waterfall on the west side and take people further up the ridge , and hopefully one to cure the California-to-Nevada transition  --  getting people further up onto Skyline . Establish a new ski @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's how you spend $40 million in the ski business . " <p> The resurgent Heavenly is most obviously on display just west of Stateline , the California/Nevada border town that provides the resort with a grand casino bed-base . Here , a state-of-the-art gondola arrows from lakeside to a lofty observation deck and terminal at elevations above 9,000 feet . It 's a 2.4 mile ride with heart-stopping views that takes just 12 minutes . <p> The gondola 's base area was originally planned as ground zero for a great economic leap forward by Heavenly . But after over-leveraged finances sent tremors through the former ASC parent firm , these base area housing options were sold to Marriott . Marriott 's new Grand Residence Club ( with 199 quarter-share condos ) and Timber Lodge ( 265 time-share units ) opened this winter . They bracket the gondola with massive yet elegant wood-and-stone structures , setting a strong , architectural theme for the ongoing South Shore redevelopment . <p> Mounting troubles next forced ASC to sell all of Heavenly to Vail . Then ASC folded its flag and decamped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't be slighted . <p> " ASC gets a bad rap . But the gondola would not have been built without them , nor would this regional redevelopment be where it is , " Wagnon said . " Our gondola area now shows the new face of Heavenly . About 30 percent of our customers come through here , and that percentage is only going to rise . " <p> Many of these clients show up from the new lodging or take short shuttle rides from the casino hotels . A new , 500-slot covered garage , scheduled to be completed this spring , should ease the current crunch for those who come by car . <p> Foremost among the people credited for the redevelopment success was Stan Hansen . He guided Heavenly 's master plan through approval by various agencies protecting the Tahoe environment so ably that ( famously ) not one letter of opposition was received . Hansen now manages a resort in Vermont . <p> Whether Heavenly 's enviable record of environmental compliance can continue in this new , Vail-ownership era is an open question . Vail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skiable acreage at its namesake resort  --  pushing past environmental objections to open up back bowls that had been pristine lynx habitat  --  ultimately prompted a backlash : $12 million worth of Vail development turned into charcoal and rubble after an arson attack in 1998 . <p> When Vail sought to expand at its Breckenridge property by 165 acres on a place called Peak 7 , it consistently disavowed any vision of added base area development  --  until it was forced to reveal precisely such plans by federal Environmental Protection Agency . <p> Maneuvers of that ilk likely wo n't play well in California . <p> " California is a citadel of the conservation movement , " said Bob Roberts , director of the California Ski Industry Association . " Because of environmental standards here , and all the watchdog groups , resort development is a slower , more deliberate process . You try to outfox that procedure at your own risk . It 's way better to cooperate . " <p> " We 're not going to dwell on the past . Here , its a new relationship between Vail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best recreational opportunities we can , " said Jane Oden , a program manager for the Tahoe Basin Unit of the U.S. Forest Service . " The restrictions now in place give us confidence we could move forward and not have impacts on the environment that ca n't be mitigated . <p> " There 's certainly enough agencies here with an eye on the ball . It 's not just us , " said Oden , citing the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency ( TRPA ) and the Lahontan Water Quality Control Board as examples . <p> Caution and mitigation already may be themes in Vail 's plans for Heavenly . Wagnon acknowledges that base area development  --  a major profit center for most resorts nowadays  --  is envisioned for the Stagecoach and Boulder lift sites on Heavenly 's Nevada side , and even atop the parking lots that sprawl around the California Lodge . <p> " We see small-scale , high-end development , low-density housing , a small village atmosphere , " Wagnon said . " Things like stream restoration and enhancement must be part of that . You ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should want to . Steps always have to be taken to protect the lake . " <p> Heavenly does n't boast many expert runs that appear on highlight reels for ski movies , though chutes of Mott Canyon and the bump runs at Gunbarrel may qualify . It does have lots of the broad , well-groomed intermediate boulevards most patrons seek . Add fast lifts , guaranteed surface quality from extensive snowmaking , as well as dazzling base area attractions , and a recipe for greater success seems within reach . <p> Wagnon rode the gondola up to a new , mid-mountain area ( the Adventure Center ) that now offers snow play ( tubing , snowshoeing and cross-country skiing ) . The site will soon host a ski school and a lodge . He was asked if it was realistic to imagine Heavenly overtaking Mammoth in popularity . <p> A grin spread over his lean face .
