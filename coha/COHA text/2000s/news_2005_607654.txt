<p> " Wild card " is a noun , referring to the extra playoff spot , one in each league , that is awarded to the second-place team with the best regular season record . Introduced by Commissioner Bud Selig and used for the first time in 1995 , it was roundly criticized by traditionalists , who saw it as a gimmick . " Wild card " can also be an adjective : wild-card race , wild-card standings , wild-card contender . <p> But right now  --  since no one can really stop us  --  we hereby coin it as a verb : " to wild card . " And what is " to wild card " ? It is to immerse oneself in a wild-card race  --  in this case , the teeming , shifting , flip-flopping , four-team National League race that has made people in Houston , Miami , Philadelphia and Washington , for a month at least , thankful for Bud Selig . <p> To wild card is to study the standings and the remaining schedules as though they contain holy secrets . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while glancing at the out-of-town scoreboard between every pitch to monitor the others . It is to pick out a slice of wild-card heaven  --  three games in three cities , involving four contenders , in 24 hours  --  book some flights , pack some bags , and have your bosses pay for the whole thing . <p> From 8:05 p.m . Wednesday to 10:11 p.m . Thursday  --  okay , that 's 26 hours , but who 's counting ?  --  you will see all four wild-card contenders : the Houston Astros and Florida Marlins at Houston 's Minute Maid Park on Wednesday night , the Washington Nationals at New York 's Shea Stadium on Thursday afternoon , and the Philadelphia Phillies at Philadelphia 's Citizens Bank Park on Thursday night . <p> People will think you 're crazy , but you will say : " No , I 'm just wild-carding . " <p> During the course of those 24 hours , you will see three of those four teams  --  Houston , Florida and Philadelphia  --  hold at least a share of the wild-card lead at one point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11/2 games on the lead . <p> You will also see Roger Clemens cry . <p> Standings at the start of the day : Team W L GB Florida 78 67  --  Philadelphia 77 68 1 Houston 76 68 11/2 Washington 74 71 4 The Houston Astros were 15 games under .500 on May 24 , and no team in the last 90 years has made the playoffs after reaching such a nadir . ( In the American League , Oakland is threatening to achieve the same feat . ) Of the four teams still in contention in the NL wild-card race , Houston is the only one that does not play in the East Division , a fact that works greatly to its advantage : While the Marlins , Phillies and Nationals spend September beating up on each other , the Astros are seeing a healthy diet of weaker Central Division chum , such as Milwaukee and Pittsburgh . As they face off this week , the Astros and Marlins are twins of a sort  --  flawed teams that , nonetheless , no one would relish playing in October . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-deep with front-line power starting pitchers  --  Houston 's Roger Clemens , Roy Oswalt and Andy Pettitte , and Florida 's Dontrelle Willis , Josh Beckett and A.J. Burnett . " We have to get there first , " says Marlins General Manager Larry Beinfest , " but when you talk about the postseason , you talk about the pitching . Power pitching in a short series is the ultimate weapon . And we think we 're in good shape there , with Willis , Beckett and Burnett . But we were talking about it last year , too , at this time , and we never got there . " Wednesday night 's Astros-Marlins game has taken on an added layer of drama . Clemens 's mother , Bess , has died earlier this morning , but word begins to make its way through the clubhouse that Clemens is planning on starting anyway . " It 's something he 's chosen to do , " veteran first baseman Jeff Bagwell says . " Only he knows his reasons . " In what was surely Houston 's biggest game of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's career  --  he pitched the Astros to a 10-2 win , then spoke poignantly about his mother for almost 20 minutes in a postgame news conference . When it was over , he hugged his family and wiped away tears . Meantime , in a somber visitors ' clubhouse , Burnett stands at his locker . One day before , he had called this " the biggest start of my career . " He has taken the loss hard . " It feels like you 're letting your team down right when they need you the most , " Burnett tells reporters . " I went from being one of the best pitchers out there to ' I ca n't win nothing now . ' To lose control like that is unacceptable . " Observations , discoveries and oddities from a close examination of the wild-card standings over the last several weeks : * Beginning Aug. 16 , there have been eight outright lead changes , including an eight-day period ( Aug. 16-23 ) when the lead changed hands between Houston and Philadelphia five times . But there have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lead at the end of a day  --  Aug. 17 ( Phillies and Astros ) , Aug. 30 ( Marlins and Phillies ) and Sept. 14 ( Marlins and Phillies ) . * Beginning Aug. 13 , no team has enjoyed a first-place lead bigger than 11/2 games . This month , there have been only three days ( Sept. 13 , Florida ; Sept. 6 and 7 , Houston ) when a team held a lead bigger than a half-game. * It used to be a five-team race . The New York Mets were as close as 11/2 games at one point ( most recently on Aug. 30 ) and were within five games of the lead as recently as Sept. 7 , but have fallen apart in the last week . * At the end of play on Aug. 30 , the bunching of the five contenders was the closest it has been all year : First and last place are separated by a total of 11/2 games . A day later , the five teams were within two games of each other , in perfectly symmetrical order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a half-game. * On Aug. 26 , with five teams separated by a total of 21/2 games , all five teams won . Two days later , with the same margin of separation , all five teams lost . * The Nationals last led the wild-card race outright at the end of play on July 27 , with a 55-46 record . The next day , they lost to the Braves to fall into a tie for the lead , and the day after that a loss to the Marlins dropped the Nationals behind the Astros. * Proof that no one seems to want to win this thing : Entering today none of the four teams has a record better than 9-6 this month . The Astros are 9-6 . The Nationals , Marlins and Phillies are 8-7 . " I said a month and a half ago , " says Astros second baseman Craig Biggio , " that it 's going down to the last weekend somewhere . " Every team chasing the wild card , in fact , is flawed by definition ; none is good enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  at one point this summer , they went nearly a month without a single homer from someone besides Carlos Delgado or Miguel Cabrera  --  and have struggled to find dependable No. 4 and No. 5 starters . The Astros are last in the league in on-base percentage , and their lineup  --  especially with third baseman Morgan Ensberg nursing a sore hand  --  is nearly devoid of dangerous hitters . They are also 12 games under .500 on the road . The Phillies have plenty of excellent Nos. 3 and 4 starters , but they lack dominant pitchers at the front end of their rotation , especially when compared to the others . The Nationals ? Well , where to begin ? They essentially have three starting pitchers . They are last in the majors in hitting and runs scored . And they sometimes do n't get along with each other , or with their manager . Standings at the start of the day : Team W L GB Florida 78 68  --  Philadelphia 78 68  --  Houston 77 68 1/2 Washington 75 71 3 One can tell a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their natural habitat . Having had their locker room music taken away recently by their manager , Frank Robinson , the Nationals have had to find other ways to occupy their time . At 11:30 a.m . Thursday , in the cramped visitors ' clubhouse at Shea Stadium , the Nationals are in chill-out mode . Video of Jae Seo , that day 's pitcher for the Mets , is playing on a television screen . Preston Wilson is the only Nationals player watching it . Livan Hernandez , the Nationals ' starting pitcher , sits at his locker in blue athletic shorts and flip-flops , with his back to the room , eating pancakes . Rookie reliever Jason Bergmann is on the couch , reading Maxim magazine . Second baseman Jose Vidro , out with an inflamed right knee , lies on the couch , nearly asleep . A few minutes earlier , Robinson had been asked why the clubhouse atmosphere does not seem to reflect the importance of these games . " There 's no why , " he said . " It just does n't . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a ballgame , to me . . . it 's not there . " Does it surprise you , Robinson was asked ? " Yeah , it does , " he said . " Because this is an opportunity that does n't come along very often . And they 've worked awful hard a long time this year , and it 's still there , it 's still possible . We 're looking for that little extra . And you do n't see it . " Twenty minutes go by , and now Nick Johnson and Jamey Carroll are watching tape of Seo , from his April 29 start at RFK Stadium . On the tape , Brian Schneider is at the plate . " Fastball , " Johnson says . Seo throws a fastball , and Schneider hits into the right field bullpen for a homer . Now , Hernandez walks through the clubhouse , dressed in those blue athletic shorts and an orange " Nationals " T-shirt . He looks at the screen and sees Seo pitching to him . " Throw me a expletive change-up , baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't leave it in the middle of the plate ! " Seo throws the change-up . " Bam ! " Hernandez yells , as he watches himself rip the pitch into the home bullpen for a homer . Robinson is asked whether , in retrospect , the rule he put in place banning music from the clubhouse  --  which he did for the purpose of trying to get the players to focus on the games  --  put a damper on his team 's personality . " No , " he said . " That was the wrong type of preparation . Fun-loving , talking about everything else besides baseball , listening to the music , playing cards and all that stuff , that 's not focusing on the game itself . . . . Start looking at tapes of the opposing pitcher , and talking about the game itself and where we are and what we have to try to go out and do . " The Nationals may not like it , but they are 8-5 since the Day the Music Died , including a 6-5 win on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standings . They keep changing , " says Nationals outfielder Ryan Church . " One day , Houston will be up there . And Florida the next day . Then Philly . If we could somehow get in there , get in that mix , then we 'll have a great opportunity . " This is the definition of wild-card mediocrity : The Philadelphia Phillies began a 12-game road trip in late August that everyone said could decide the fate of their season . They went 6-6 on the road trip . They returned home for a 10-game homestand at Citizens Bank Park , which everyone said could decide the fate of their season . The homestand ended Thursday night with a loss to the Atlanta Braves , failing to complete what would have been a huge four-game sweep . The Phillies went 5-5 on the homestand . " I 'll say it again , " says catcher Todd Pratt , as the Phillies dress to hit the road for a nine-game road trip to Florida , Atlanta and Cincinnati . " This is going to end in Washington "  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I know we lost tonight , " says reserve outfielder Jason Michaels . " But this was a big series win . I think we should go to Florida thinking we have some momentum . " Everyone is trying to calculate what record it is going to take to win the wild card . Phillies Manager Charlie Manuel once thought 86 wins would get it done , but he has modified his prediction : " I think we 're going to have to go a little better . I think 87 or 88 wins is going to win this . We 're right there . " Standings at the conclusion of play Thursday : Team W L GB Houston 78 68  --  Philadelphia 78 69 1/2 Florida 78 69 1/2 Washington 76 71 21/2 <p> The door closes behind the last Phillie out the door , as they head to the team bus and then on to Florida . And we all know what they are doing at this very moment : <p> They are wild-carding . <p> Staff writer Barry Svrluga contributed to this report .
