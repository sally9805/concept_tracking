Trophy Hunters are Wiping out British Columbia 's Grizzlies // Tourists jam Glendale Lodge in Knight Inlet , British Columbia , every fall to witness grizzlies feeding on pink salmon migrating upriver to spawn . They shoot the fearsome bears  --  with their cameras . But a different sort of visitor also comes to the coastal temperate rainforest to shoot some griz . With a gun . Hundreds from Canada , the U.S. and Europe are paying upwards of $10,000 for the opportunity to join a hunt that begins every September 1 . They hunt grizzlies for the trophy , never for the meat . And now there 's trouble . The grizzly , hunted to extinction throughout most of its range in North America , may be facing a similar fate here in British Columbia ( B.C. ) . Disturbing new evidence suggests grizzlies are being systematically extinguished from the province . Last December , 68 professional biologists called for a hunting moratorium pending the completion of long-term population studies throughout B.C. " The B.C. government denies that sport hunting is killing off its coastal grizzly bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grizzly populations , " says Chris Genovali of the Raincoast Conservation Society . The group , based in Sidney , B.C. , is fighting to protect the vast Great Bear Rainforest , which stretches almost the entire length of the B.C. coast . " As a professional biologist , ecotour operator and just being on this small globe of ours , I find it appalling that this is allowed to continue , " says Richard Biel of Canadian Wilderness Ecotours . " The oldest bears being killed now are around four years old . These creatures live to be 20 to 25 years old . " The government of British Columbia claims that 's all nonsense . The official line is that the grizzly bear population is in no danger of extinction . The government has the backing of a powerful hunting lobby , the B.C. Wildlife Federation . This group , which recently brought National Rifle Association President Charlton Heston to speak at its annual convention , insists on a right to hunt . As for the hunters , many of them are wealthy Americans eager to show friends back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies are being challenged by conservation groups in Canada , the U.S. and Europe as the brutal slaughter of an endangered species for the benefit of a small but loud cadre of hunters . The policies are also being questioned from within . One government biologist , Dionys de Leeuw , warns that hunting is on pace to extinguish all grizzlies from British Columbia between 2020 and 2034 . Extinction could come even quicker , he adds , unless the B.C. government heeds its own warnings about the devastating effects of ongoing timber harvests in grizzly habitat . Last November , in a celebrated report entitled " Grizzly Overkill in British Columbia Bear Management , " de Leeuw , a senior habitat protection biologist with the B.C. Ministry of Environment , Lands and Parks , writes that the province has vastly overestimated the number of grizzlies still alive in B.C. , and is allowing them to be shot at an unsustainable rate . " B.C. grizzly bears are declining , " de Leeuw says . " Exacerbating that decline by continuing the grizzly bear hunt is biologically irresponsible . " Official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 14,000 , but de Leeuw says overhunting may have reduced the population to as few as 3,000 . Hunters kill an estimated 300 each year , with another 300 killed for public safety purposes and by poachers . Over a 33-year period from 1965 to 1997 , he estimates more than 6,000 female bears were slaughtered , far in excess of the number the B.C. government considers sustainable . " These results are discouraging at best , " de Leeuw writes . " They clearly indicate that rather than controlling the total kill of grizzly bears to what may well be an arbitrarily conservative level , for 33 years the province has allowed the kill to exceed its own standard of sustainable mortality . " Compounding matters is the dubious nature of the B.C. Ministry of Environment 's grizzly population estimates . From 1972 to 1979 the province estimated a population of 6,660 grizzly bears . But in 1990 , the Ministry estimated that the province was home to 13,160 bears , using a " habitat suitability " model that assumes grizzlies occupy all suitable habitat . de Leeuw contends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be exterminated in B.C. by sport hunters , and the government would still allow hunting . Jim Yardley , director ot the Environment Ministry 's office in Smithers , a community on the Skeena River in north-central B.C. , says that de Leeuw 's views " do not reflect the views of the ministry , which believes it is managing grizzly bears appropriately and conservatively . " de Leeuw was slapped with a gag order and an unpaid suspension when he attempted to circulate his findings among his ministry colleagues . But even some hunters are getting the picture . Kolbjorn Eide , a former hunting guide in the Lower Skeena region , quit the business a few years ago because of declining bear numbers , and now supports a hunting moratorium . Photograph Are British Columbia 's grizzly bears being slaughtered by hunters , or managed sustainably ? It depends on who you ask . // " In the last 30 years , I would say we have lost about 80 percent of our grizzly population in the Lower Skeena , " says Eide . " The B.C. Ministry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bears , and they still do n't . There is nothing to save them if they keep up their policies . " Numerous scientists interviewed for this article say de Leeuw 's report has significant scientific merit . " It 's pretty damning information , " says Dr. Bryan Horejsi , a carnivore biologist in Calgary . " There are more than enough reasons to be suspicious about the government 's numbers . " Environmentalists are fighting back . The Raincoast Conservation Society and the Environmental Investigations Agency ( EIA ) , a nonprofit based in London , have organized a protest among tourism companies in Europe , Canada and the U.S. " We 're jacking up pressure on the economic side , " says Martin Powell , an EIA operative . " The tourism industry is deeply concerned because people have put off coming to B.C. It 's only a matter of time when that trickle turns into a flood . " EIA has also launched an appeal with the United Nations , under the Convention on International Treaty in Endangered Species ( CITES ) . The treaty bans the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts . The U.S. and Canada are among the 152 nations that have signed the treaty . " We want a ban on all exports of grizzly trophies , " Powell says , " so foreign hunters wo n't be allowed to take their artifacts out of the country with them , and so they wo n't go there to hunt in the first place .
