Day of the Dead A Novel of Suspense Chapter One They say it happened long ago that I'itoi , Elder Brother , came to a village to see if his Desert People had enough water after the long summer heat . As he walked along he heard a crowd of Indian children playing . He stopped for a while and watched them , listening to the music of their voices and laughter . About that time Elder Brother saw an old woman carrying a heavy load of wood for her cooking fire . Old Woman was not as happy and carefree as the children . She had no energy to sing or play . About that time an old coyote came and stood by I'itoi . He , too , watched the children . Old Coyote 's ribs showed under his thin , ragged coat . Like Old Woman , Old Coyote could no longer play and dance . His paws were too stiff and sore from just walking around in the desert . Seeing Old Woman and Old Coyote made I'itoi sad . Because Elder Brother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He went to the shade of some cottonwood trees to rest . It was autumn , so the leaves on the tree had turned yellow , but they still made shade . As Great Spirit sat under the trees , he thought about the children at play and about how different they would be when they grew old . He thought about some young calves he had seen that morning in a field and about how they would change as they grew older . He thought about a young colt he had seen kicking up its heels with joy , and he thought about how , one day , Young Colt would become Old Horse . He thought about flowers and about how their leaves withered and their colors faded when they grew old . Thinking about these things , I'itoi decided he would like to have something around him that would not change as it became old . He wanted something that would not grow heavy like the cows and horses or wrinkled and bent like old men and women or dry and colorless like dead flowers . Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the children . As I'itoi was thinking these things under the cottonwood trees , he looked up . He saw the yellow leaves . He saw the blue sky through the leaves . He saw the shadows under the yellow leaves . He looked down and saw streaks and spots of sunlight dancing around on the ground just as the Indian Children had danced . Then Great Spirit laughed , for you see , nawoj  --  my friend , I'itoi had found just what he wanted . March 16 , 2000 Brandon Walker stood in front of the bathroom mirror locked in mortal combat with the stubborn strings of his bow tie . As sweat dampened his brow and soaked through the underarms of his starched white shirt , he longed for the good old days when , as Pima County sheriff , he could have shown up at one of these cattle calls in his dress uniform instead of having to put on a stupid tuxedo . There was a tap on the door . " Are you ready ? " Diana asked . " It 's getting late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this damned tie , " Brandon grunted . Diana opened the door , and her reflection joined his in the mirror . She was so beautiful that seeing her took Brandon 's breath away . She was dressed in a deep blue full-length taffeta gown that complemented every inch of her still slim figure . In the cleft at the base of her throat a diamond solitaire pendant hung from a slender gold chain . That single piece of jewelry had cost more than Brandon 's first house . Her auburn hair , highlighted now with natural streaks of gray , was pulled back in an elegant French twist . " Hi , gorgeous , " he said . She smiled back at him . " You 're not so bad yourself . What 's the trouble ? " " The bow , " he said . " I 'm all fumble fingers . " It took only a few seconds for her to untangle and straighten the tie . " There , " she said , patting his shoulder . " Now let 's get going . " Brandon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way into it as he followed his wife down the hall . " Which car ? " he asked . " Mine or yours ? " " Yours , " she said . They drove east from Gates Pass and into downtown Tucson to the community center where the Tucson Man and Woman of the Year benefit gala was being held . The honorees , Gayle and Dr. Lawrence Stryker , were friends of Diana Ladd 's dating back to her days as a teacher on the Tohono O'odham Reservation . Now a local luminary , Diana had been asked to give a short introductory and no doubt laudatory speech . Brandon 's plan was to go , be seen , and do his best to be agreeable . But when it came to Larry and Gayle Stryker , he intended to keep his mouth firmly shut . That would be best for all concerned . Larry Stryker sat on the dais overlooking the decorated ballroom filled with candlelit banquet tables and listened as Diana Ladd stood at the microphone and spoke about old times . " As some of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough patch . I was teaching on the reservation , had lost my husband , and had a brand-new baby . Not many people stuck with me during that time , but Larry and Gayle Stryker did , and I 'll always be grateful for that . Over the years it 's been gratifying for me to see what they 've done with their lives and to watch as they 've turned a single idea into a powerful tool for good . " Larry searched the sea of upturned faces until he caught sight of Brandon Walker sitting at one of the foremost tables . The former sheriff , looking uncomfortable and out of his element in what was probably a rented tux , sat with his arms folded across his chest . Their eyes met briefly . Brandon nodded in acknowledgment , but there was nothing friendly in the gesture  --  on either side . Former sheriff . That was the operant word here . While Diana Ladd spoke of the good old times , Larry was free to let his thoughts drift back to those times as well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brandon Walker  --  was able to read his mind .
