American leaders might be forgiven for intervening in countries about which they were so ignorant . What is harder to justify is their refusal to listen to their own intelligence agents . Chiefs of the CIA stations in Tehran , Guatemala City , Saigon , and Santiago explicitly warned against staging these coups . Officials in Washington paid no heed . They rejected or ignored all intelligence reports that contradicted what they instinctively believed . // Americans who think about and make foreign policy grasp the nature of alliances , big-power rivalries , and wars of conquest . The passionate desire of people in poor countries to assert control over their natural resources , which pushed them into conflict with the United States during the Cold War , lay completely outside the experience of most American leaders . Henry Kissinger spoke for them , eloquently as always , after Chilean foreign minister Gabriel Valdes accused him of knowing nothing about the Southern Hemisphere . // " No , and I do n't care , " Kissinger replied . " Nothing important can come from the south . History @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of history starts in Moscow , goes to Bonn , crosses over to Washington , and then goes to Tokyo . What happens in the south is of no importance . " // This attitude made it easy for American statesmen to misunderstand why nationalist movements arose in the developing world . //
