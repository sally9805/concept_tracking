It 's inevitable . One day , that high-speed personal computer you fell in love with ( and paid big bucks for ) will become a relic . At that point , you 're faced with two options . You can send your old box into retirement and replace it with a brand-new digital jewel , or you can attempt to bring Old Faithful back to life with an upgrade . Whether you decide to upgrade or buy new , the whole purpose is to end up with a faster computer . Therefore , you need to first determine exactly where the performance bottleneck is , and whether it 's economical to remedy it . The problem could be a fast processor tied to a small , slow hard drive . Or maybe your system is bogged down by a lack of RAM . Perhaps an outdated video card is keeping you from buying the games you want . If you can narrow your computer woes down to a single component-or maybe even two or threethere 's a good chance that an upgrade is in order . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of components-especially given the wide variety of under-$1000 computers on the market-a system upgrade can quickly become cost prohibitive . In other words , while any one of the upgrades we describe here could be valuable , whether to upgrade an old PC or buy a new one depends on individual needs and wants . Thanks For The Memory That 's what your PC will say to you if you increase the system memory , or RAM . For the most basic computer use , 64MB may be enough . However , we generally do n't recommend a system with less than 128MB . And if you work with graphics , buy as much memory as you can afford . Photograph Photograph // The trick to a memory upgrade is knowing what type of memory to buy . The manual that came with your PC should tell you exactly what you need . However , if you ca n't find the manual , simply remove one of the memory chips that 's in your computer , wrap it in wax paper to protect it from static , and take it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are two reasons to upgrade your hard drive . Your current drive is either too small or too slow , or both . If your current drive runs at 5400 rpm or slower and you 're running out of room , it 's probably time for a new drive . We looked at a 7200-rpm , 60GB Maxtor hard drive ( about $280 ) . Installation is easy . Just switch the jumper from master to slave , install the drive using the included cable and hardware , do a little bit of setup , and you 're in business . If you plan to replace your existing hard drive , you 'll want to clone your old drive onto your new drive . Just install the new drive as a slave , cloning the old drive using an upgrade package like Symantec 's Norton Ghost 2001 , removing the old drive , resetting the jumpers on the new drive to master , and moving the new drive to the old slot . Great Gamin If computer gaming is your thing , you know you need a top of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims is the world 's fastest Graphics Processing Unit , packs second-generation transform and lighting , realtime per-pixel shading , and incredible high-definition video-processing capabilities . It can process up to 1 gigapixel ( 1 billion pixels ) per second , 2 gigatexels per second , and 31 million triangles per second . That 's one screaming gaming experience .

If you 're interested in the GeForce2 Ultra , look for video cards such as Creative 's 3D Blaster Annihilator 2 Ultra or ELSA 's Gladiac Ultra . Expect to pay between $400 and $600 . Sound Bytes If you want great sound , do n't rely on the soundcard that came with your system . We looked at Sound Blaster Live ! Platinum 5.1 , from Creative . In addition to a PCI slot , Sound Blaster Live ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ package includes a module that fits in the drive bay for easy access from the front of your computer . The module consists of various line-in and line-out ports , as well as an infrared eye for a remote control , which is included . The package comes with all the cabling , hardware and instructions that you need to get your sound up and running quickly . The cost of this remarkable sound system is about $200 . Of course , you 're going to need better speakers , too . If you want to take advantage of the surroundsound capabilities of your Sound Blaster Live ! Platinum 5.1 , take a look at Monsoon 's MM-2000 speaker system . This package uses Monsoon 's Planar Focus Technology ( PFT ) in all four satellite sneakers , and also adds a massive 340-watt amplifier . It 'll rock ya . This runs for $300 . If you 'd rather have a three-speaker system , we recommend the Monsoon MM-700 flat-panel PC audio system . The subwoofer is pretty standard , but the satellite speakers , like those in the MM-2000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the aforementioned probably will show you some performance gains , but sooner or later , it will be your central processing unit ( CPU ) that 's got ta go . If you 're looking to upgrade , there are two options . You can replace your entire motherboard , or you can simply upgrade your current processor . Most computers made in the past four years have cases that require a motherboard with what 's called an ATX form factor . This de facto standard allows many manufacturers to produce motherboards that will easily fit into a wide variety of other manufacturers ' computer cases . First decide what type of processor you want to upgrade to , then choose an ATX motherboard that supports that processor . Another option is to upgrade just your processor through some thirdparty vendor , such as PowerLeap . This may make things simpler , but this approach requires more careful planning because what you can upgrade to depends on exactly what you are starting with . The good news is , PowerLeap is generally helpful in assisting you with these issues . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your current system , this can be a great way to solve your slow CPU woes . Go USB It 's hard to imagine personal computing before Universal Serial Bus ( USB ) . We remember fiddling with serial ports , trying to match a nine-pin cable to a 25-pin plug . It was n't very pretty . USB solved those issues . Virtually all new computers have at least two USB ports and , at least in theory , you can hang over 100 devices off a single USB port . The key to using multiple devices on a single USB port is adding a so-called USB hub , which has multiple USB ports of its own , into which you can plug other devices . The most innovative USB hub we 've seen is the Belkin USB BusStation . For about $80 , the USB BusStation offers a seven-port hub . Four of these ports are located in the base , but each of the other three is located in a removable module , which creates room for other modules . The Network Beats On One of the easiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . As a home user , you have several options , but the best-and least cumbersome-approach is usually wireless networking . We recommend 3Com 's Home Wireless Gateway and its associated products . The Home Wireless Gateway serves as a hub for wireless networking , but also includes three standard Ethernet ports for connecting devices . The Home Wireless Gateway is also an Internet router , letting your computers share a single cable or DSL Internet connection . Warning , this is n't a cheap proposition . The Home Wireless Gateway sells for about $400 . Next , you 'll need to add a wireless networking card to each computer , which can range from $200 to $300 per computer . It 's an expensive option , but it 's truly worth it .
