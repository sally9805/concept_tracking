Early Risers <p> Midsummer : The long days begin in bright , rising mist and never end . Their hours stretch , they stretch . They stretch to hold everything you can shove into them ; they 'll take whatever you 've got . Action , no action , good ideas , bad ideas , talk , love , trouble , every kind of lie  --  they 'll hold them all . Work ? No . Nobody works any longer . To be sure , they did . The farmers worked . The midsummer days were the best working time of the year for the farmers , but the farmers are gone . They worked , they built , but they 're gone . Who 's next ? <p> Sheriff Ripley Wingate , an early riser , turned off the road and into the lot behind the courthouse . Not yet seven . The morning fog still hung to the ground , a heavy gray curtain . It shifted , wavered , passed in woolly swags and swirls , parted . Nearly hidden in the mist , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little car , empty . <p> The sheriff parked his truck in his spot near the court building and walked across the lot to the car , an Escort with its rear window partly broken out and covered with a plastic sheet and tape . He approached the passenger 's side and bent to look inside the car . Not empty . A young woman was curled up in the driver 's seat , asleep . Her knees were pulled up behind the steering wheel ; her head rested against the window . On the passenger 's seat beside her was a kitchen knife with a blade maybe four inches long , and in the rear seat a furry bundle the sheriff could n't quite make out . He tapped lightly on the window . <p> The sleeping woman opened her eyes . She looked around her , then saw the sheriff at the window . She started . She drew back against her door , watching him . Her right hand went to the little knife on the seat beside her . <p> " Help you ? " Sheriff Wingate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheriff , " the young woman said . <p> " What ? " <p> " I 'm waiting for the sheriff , " the young woman said again , louder , to be heard through the closed windows of the little car . <p> " I 'm the sheriff . " <p> " You are ? " <p> " Why do n't you come on inside ? " the sheriff said . He nodded toward the courthouse . <p> The young woman made no move to leave the car , but she leaned across the seat and rolled the passenger 's window down a couple of inches . <p> " You do n't have a uniform , " she said . <p> " No , " the sheriff said . He straightened and turned to start back to the courthouse . <p> " How do I know you 're the sheriff ? " <p> " I do n't know what to tell you , " the sheriff said . " You can sit out here long as you want . Maybe another sheriff will come along . " <p> " Wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the seat , opened the door , and stood beside her car . She was tall and wore her brown hair long , very long , in a soft fall that hung down her back past her shoulder blades . The sheriff watched her . She did n't look drunk , she did n't act drunk , she did n't smell drunk . She closed the car door and looked across its roof at him . <p> " All right , " she said . <p> The sheriff waited for her , letting her go ahead of him . <p> " You first , " said the young woman . <p> The sheriff shook his head . " I ai n't the one with the knife , " he said . " You are . You go in front . " <p> " Oh , " said the young woman . The kitchen knife lay on the seat of her car . She left it and started toward the courthouse , with the sheriff following her . <p> In his tiny office in the basement of the courthouse Sheriff Wingate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the young woman sat . He let her sit for a minute , let her settle , while he fussed . He started the coffee machine , he tore yesterday 's page from his calendar and tossed it into the wastepaper basket . He turned the volume on the radio scanner up , then down . Then he sat behind his desk , facing the young woman . <p> " What can we do for you ? " the sheriff asked her . <p> " I need help , " the young woman said . <p> " Help with what ? " <p> " He 's after me , " she said . " A man . He wants to hurt me . " <p> " A man ? " <p> " That 's right . He watches me . He follows me . He wo n't let me alone . " <p> " Blackway , " the sheriff said . <p> " You know about this ? " <p> " I know Blackway , " the sheriff said . " Most around here do . Coffee ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young woman shook her head . <p> The sheriff poured himself a cup of coffee and returned to his chair . <p> " Blackway 's following you ? " he asked . <p> " That 's what I said . " <p> " For how long ? " <p> " A week , ten days , " the young woman said . " He watches me . Like one time , I was coming out of a lot . He pulled in front of me , cut me off . He just sat there , in that big truck he has . Looking at me . Letting me see him looking at me . Then he went away . He 'd done that before . Then he smashed in the window of my car . " <p> " You were there when he did that ? " the sheriff asked her . " You saw him ? " <p> " No . It happened at night . I was asleep , the car was parked . " <p> " Anybody else see him , you know about ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sure he did it . " <p> " He did it , " the young woman said . " Who else would ? " <p> " Maybe nobody , " said the sheriff . " Maybe a lot of people . What else ? " <p> Now the young woman swallowed hard . She looked at the floor , shook her head . She tried to answer , swallowed again . <p> " Take it easy , " said the sheriff . <p> " Annabelle , " the young woman said at last . " He got Annabelle . He came to my place and he got her . " <p> " Annabelle ? " <p> " My cat . He killed her . " <p> The sheriff nodded . " You had her in the backseat , " he said . <p> " Last night , " the young woman said . " I found her on my front steps . Her throat was cut . Her head was almost cut off . " <p> " Take it easy , " said the sheriff . <p> The young woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> <br> Continues ...
