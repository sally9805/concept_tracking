Why are n't more young adults making it to Mass ? We went straight to the source for answers . Their reasons , they say , range from a crowded calendar to disenchantment with the church to just prefering to stay in with the Sunday paper . // When Molly Mattesfcch served as a Peace Corps volunteer two years ago in the West African nation of Mali , she relied on audio tapes of Sunday Mass to stay connected to her Catholic faith during her two-year tenure in the predominantly Muslim nation . " It was the first time I 'd ever been without an organized Catholic Church , " said the 27-year-old , who now lives in Washington , D.C. Mattessich , who had sung weekly in a Newman Center choir during her years as a Wellesley College student , drew strength during this challenging time from her favorite church song , " Be Not Afraid . " " It became my mantra during my time in the Peace Corps , " she says . But after a few months , tapes and mantras were n't enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identifies her Peace Corps years as a spiritual turning point . " I listened to the same services over and over , and it became hard to keep up without the community , " she says . " I started journaling a lot more , and I thought , " Hmm , I can sort of live without this , maybe . ' " Complicating matters further was Mattessich 's growing awareness of the lack of church leadership roles held by women , which began to trouble her more and more . Witnessing the widespread effects of AIDS in Africa caused her to question the church 's teaching on contraception . Then , after she returned to the United States , her favorite Boston parish closed . It was the last straw . Mattessich says she " almost never " attends Mass anymore . When she does , she harbors negative feelings toward what she experiences . " When I go to Catholic services now , I think , " Oh my gosh , you people have no connection to reality , ' " she says . Mattessich has decidedly relinquished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a multitude of young adult Catholics have chosen to do the same . Whether their absences stem from a disagreement with church teachings or the seductive powers of the Sunday paper , for the church , the widespread lack of engagement among its younger members is an inconvenient truth whose underpinnings are hard to discern . Missing in inaction Only 24 percent of young adult Catholics attend Mass every week , while 21 percent attend two to three times per month , according to a 2005 study conducted by sociologists William V. D'Antonio , James Davidson , Dean Hoge and Mary Gautier , authors of the forthcoming book Catholics in America : Their Faith and Their Church ( Sheed &; Ward ) . According to the same study , 80 percent of young adult Catholics believe they can be a good Catholic without attending Mass weekly , a belief that differentiates them from their parents ' generation , many of whom wholly internalized what they were taught as children : to miss Mass was a grave offense , even a mortal sin . While some may criticize younger adults for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attending Mass , it 's worth noting that many baby boomers and their pre-Vatican II predecessors attended weekly Mass without much reflection on their motivations for attending . Kevin Burns , 27 , a currency trader in Providence , Rhode Island , counts himself among the more than 55 percent of young adult Catholics who do not regularly attend church . Burns acknowledges that Catholicism no longer holds the pivotal place in his life it did during his childhood , which was formed by regular CCD classes and four years of Catholic high school education . While Burns says he drifted away from the church during his college years without much reflection , as he grows older , it 's ideological disagreements that have kept him away . He cited a few incendiary homilies he heard in his hometown parish that were characterized by what he perceived as overly fearful attitudes toward modern science and pop culture . A July 1 New York Times article , which quoted a senior Vatican official 's call for excommunication of stem cell researchers who utilize human embryos , troubled Burns further . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you pick and choose , " Burns says . " I wonder , " How Catholic am I if I really do n't buy that ? ' ' " For Burns " wife , Shannon , a 27-year-old special education teacher , her years at Providence College , where she and Kevin met , also marked a time of turning away from church , though her own misgivings had more to do with her compatriots in the campus chapel pews . " The people who were adamant about going were also the people you saw out at the bars trashed the night before , hooking up with other people , " Shannon Burns says . " It made a mockery of it and kind of cheapened it for me . After a while it did n't mean as much . " Church interrupted For other young adults , practical rather than ideological factors prevent them from attending Mass regularly . Josh Nelson , a 29-year-old consultant in Chicago , said that , despite the convenience of a parish located four blocks from his apartment , other recreational weekend activities tend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken precedence . When I 'm out late on Saturday , Mass is definitely the easiest thing to cut out of a busy day , " he says . " It 's very easy to go when that is the environment or the type of people you surround yourself with , but I find myself less surrounded by people who go every week . When I 'm with certain friends I 'll go-no question . But it 's less of a priority if it does n't fit with what I already have planned . " According to Nelson , religion is rarely discussed among the group of young professionals he regularly socializes with in Chicago . " Except for joking around with stories about how it affected how you were raised , it does n't come up much , " Nelson says . " Most times you may or may not know someone 's religious affiliation , unless they 're Jewish . " Missing identity Unlike their parents ' generations , many of whom enjoyed the cultural support of Irish , Polish , and Italian Catholic neighborhood enclaves , today 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religiously diverse . As Ethan Watters reported in his 2004 book Urban Tribes ( Bloomsbury ) , college-educated young adults often draw support from closeknit communities of friends-often from diverse religious or non-religious backgrounds-that form during the ever-increasing years between college and married life . Young adults often live , work , share meals , and vacation with these groups , which often function as family for twenty- and thirty-somethings living far from home . Though people like Nelson enjoy the support of a close-knit group of friends , other young adults attribute their missing Mass to a sense of isolation and a lack of social networks , a trend that author Robert Putnam chronicled in his 2000 book Bowling Alone ( Simon &; Schuster ) . Carrie Salinas , a 21-year-old living on Oahu , a Hawaiian island 4,000 miles from her small-town Indiana home , says that , had her husband 's military position not taken the newly married couple far from family , she probably would still be attending Mass every Sunday , as she has for her whole life alongside her parents , aunts , uncles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go is because I was always used to having somebody to go with , " Salinas says . " I miss being able to go every week with my family . What I miss most is not the Mass aspect of it , but what I associate with the tradition , how we would all go together to my grandparents ' house for a couple of hours afterwards . " Separation anxiety Tom Silva , a 38-year-old Chicago marketing director who describes himself as being " estranged " from the church , said he has found that being a Christian in the " real world " can be very isolating . " You 're isolated often from your peer group and from mainstream society , and it can be very difficult , very lonely , " says Silva , a passionate devotee of art , philosophy , and screenwriting . " It sometimes feels like religion almost has an exclusionary quality . " He says he gradually lost interest in attending church after being unable to find a parish that offered a forum for discussion of things like poetry , music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a wider creative culture hints at another chasm : The gap between the church milieu and the pop culturesaturated world young adults inhabit . While they do n't expect Father to channel Jon Stewart or Chris Rock , young adults often find difficulty connecting what they experience inside church with the complicated mix of media messages , work , relationships , and daily ethical dilemmas that await them outside of church . " I wish the church had a way of trying to enter that world so that there is n't a sort of strict separation-that 's where the passions of young people are , and these are the places where things resonate most powerfully , " Silva says . Searching for silence It 's difficult , however , to characterize the needs of an entire generation . Mary Dashmaw , for example , a 28-year-old living in Phoenix , wishes that certain trappings of pop culture had n't made their way into the music at Mass . According to Dashmaw , a manager in the health care industry , the Masses she has attended in the past have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competed for her attention . " Church started to feel really loud , " Dashmaw says . " They had a band , not just with singing , but with drum kits . It was very distracting .... I think it was originally intended for the youth Mass , but it ended up at all the Masses . I would get really agitated . " Dashmaw says at one point she found spiritual solace in the Latin Mass , which she experienced while studying abroad in Italy . " That is where it felt most pure , " she says . " The rituals were really clear and unfogged . I had a feeling of calm , of feeling that connection to something higher than myself . It was a quiet , solemn time where I could think . " Despite the tranquility she found in the Latin Mass , other disruptive voices persisted . " The judgment became deafening to me as well , " Dashmaw says , referring to a contentious homily she once heard on abortion . " The priest was demonizing the choices of people who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been drawn out of the gospel that day . It was so blatant . " Dashmaw said that while she would not have an abortion herself , she does n't believe that it 's the church 's right to impose its views on others . Gone for long ? Though young adults say they miss certain aspects of attending Mass , many also say that substantial changes either to church teaching , the Mass itself , or their own lifestyles would have to take place for them to resume regular Mass attendance . None of the twenty- and thirtysomethings interviewed for this article has ceased to call himself or herself Catholic , though some have dabbled in other faith traditions and others add qualifiers to their religious self-identification , referring to themselves only as " reluctantly Catholic " or " raised Catholic . " " I never say just " Catholic , " " Molly Mattessich says . " I say " liberal Catholic " or " feminist Catholic . " It 's extremely important . When I hear myself say I 'm a Catholic , I sort of cringe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mattessich says she has tried periodically attending services at a Unitarian church . While she has found them to be thoughtful , she missed the Catholic Mass . " I miss Eucharist , " Mattessich says . " I miss songs that are familiar to me . My parents say , " You need to find a church ; you need to find somewhere you can sing because you always used to love that . ' ' " Mattessich says that if she were able to find the kind of parish she envisions , she would consider returning to Mass regularly . " I could get back with a good , vibrant , strong community with progressive-thinking clergy , " she says . " I feel like you can be a Catholic and not believe all the written doctrines of the church . I want to be in a place where people think that . " Value judgments Kevin and Shannon Burns say they 'll make a concerted effort to attend church regularly when they have children because they believe it will provide their kids with a strong moral foundation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe in , and the main values that the church is built on are fabulous-love one another as you love yourself , be honest and truthful , do n't hurt people , " says Shannon . " It teaches kids in a way that 's not just coming from their parents , " says Kevin . " There 's a certain set of values that priests are able to articulate in a way that other people are n't . " But even though he wants his future children to be exposed to Catholic values , he 's not as open anymore to being influenced by them himself . " I see the value hi it for when we have kids , but maybe not so much for me , " he says . Since she last attended Mass a year ago , Mary Dashmaw says that spending quiet time outdoors either walking her dog or riding her horse has become a solemn , meditative experience for her , a source of tranquility similar to what she used to experience at Mass , though she still feels a spiritual void . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't know if I 'm deluding myself , but when people actually say what the church stands for , that gay people are n't welcome in the church , that 's when I realize that I can no longer be a part of it . But if there were church reforms , and if we were to go back to a more basic Mass , I would be proud to be a Catholic . " Maybe later Josh Nelson realizes that returning to church regularly would require a personal commitment on his part " It would involve making a conscious decision that it 's something I want to do , " Nelson says . " It 's not like I 'm looking for it to be this life-changing experience , or that I 'm looking for a parish that 's fantastic , invigorating or whatever , but it would be a matter of me making it more of a priority , or involving myself in something at the church that would keep me coming back . " Nelson says he views the Mass not so much in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but as a time where " once a week you are giving your time to God . " It does n't matter as much to him that the liturgy does n't seem especially tuned in to his life as a young professional . " People will say that the church 's views are outdated , or maybe it does n't speak your language or to my everyday activities , but that 's Catholicism . Religion does n't change with the times . It is what it is , " Nelson says . Many young adults , however , do wish that the church would change with the times , though most recognize that it probably wo n't happen anytime soon . For people like Molly Mattessich , however , the consequences encompass more than missing an hour of Sunday Mass . " My prayer life has unfortunately faded away , " Mattessich says . " I find it hard to reconnect with God in the same way it 's hard to reconnect with a good friend after a long time away . Maybe my expectations are too high . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can be a Catholic and not believe all the written doctrines of the church . I want to be in a place where people think like that .
