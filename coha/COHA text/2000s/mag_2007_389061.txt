Headnote Slip away-this time of year you can afford a slice of paradise . I stand on the dock at South Seas Island Resort , gazing across the water at what looks like a shimmering island covered with snowy sand . Then I watch it fly away in a flurry of feathers . " Those are all white pelicans , " resort naturalist Vince McGrath says with a smile , speaking of the birds that winter here from mid-October through mid-April . " The largest of them stand 60 inches tall with 10-foot wingspans . " Magic like that happens all day long on Sanibel and Captiva . These two enchanted islands are so exotic and beautiful , I almost expect to see a customs office when I cross the bridge from the mainland . It feels like the gateway to a foreign country , but you do n't need a passport to visit this wave-washed paradise . " You 'll never see a high-rise on Sanibel-God willing , " Vince says . Franchises fade away too . There 's only one chain hotel-a Holiday Inn . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only golden arches you 'll see . Not a Light in Sight People take pride in the fact that there is n't a single traffic signal on either island . You know what stops people around here ? Sunsets so breathtaking they leave you speechless . Water so translucent you can see a cormorant swimming beneath your boat when you go canoeing . All sorts of other critters make you pause with delight . This morning , I watched cars filled with visitors halt to see raccoons play in J.N. " Ding " Darling National Wildlife Refuge . Not far from the dunes on Bowman 's Beach , signs in neighborhoods urge motorists to slow down for tortoises . Take Time for Turtles Linda Logan , general manager of the Song of the Sea resort , leads guests on beach walks to mark nests of loggerhead turtles . Females crawl ashore in darkness to lay their eggs . During the nesting season , from May through October , beach residents and visitors have to turn off or shield any lights that can be seen from the beach to avoid confusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my favorite months , " Linda says . In the value season-which lasts until early November-the islands are less crowded , and room rates drop dramatically . Fresh Rooms Renovations have refreshed much of the lodging since Hurricane Charley blew through nearly three years ago . Work ranged from refurbishing the cozy , 30-room Song of the Sea to a $140-million renewal of the luxurious South Seas Island Resort . This resort , the area 's largest , closed for almost two years to add rooms , pools , and other amenities . " The wildlife recovered from the storm in a hurry , " Vince points out . " You can stand on the dock and see all kinds of birds . It 's a manatee and dolphin highway . " A manatee surfaces like a stealthy submarine in the marina that 's a base for Steve and Doris Colgate 's Offshore Sailing School . Attendees to the three-day school for beginners learn the basics on the same type of boats that plebes sail at the U.S. Naval Academy . The youngest new sailor last year was 9 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many easy ways to enjoy the natural beauty of the islands . You can explore the diverse wildlife habitat that includes the interior wetlands ecosystem on 4 miles of walking trails around the Sanibel-Captiva Conservation Foundation Nature Center . It 's part of nearly 2,000 acres that the group preserves on the barrier islands . At the nearby " Ding " Darling wildlife refuge , you do n't even have to get out of your car to view wildlife . The 4-mile Wildlife Drive ( closed on Friday ) winds along the water 's edge at the almost 7,000-acre sanctuary . One afternoon , I paddled across Tarpon Bay with Betsy clayton , coordinator of the new Great Calusa Blueway Paddling Trail , a nearly 100-mile-long route that weaves through the shallows and hidden inlets of these coastal islands . In the depths of the crystalline water , I could see blue crabs scurrying on the bottom . Overhead , a statuesque frigatebird rode a lofty current .
