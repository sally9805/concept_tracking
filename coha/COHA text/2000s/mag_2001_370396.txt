Tewksbury , Mass. , used to be known for its carnation industry . Now it nurtures something far more fragile  --  the images of Julia Roberts , Russell Crowe and just about every other TV and film actor . Located half an hour north of Boston , Tewksbury is home to Avid Technology , whose 1,700-plus employees are resisting the attempts of Japanese giants Sony Corp . and Matsushita Electric Industrial ( the parent company of Panasonic ) to penetrate the fast-growing market for digital video-editing software . <P> Founded in 1987 , Avid makes tools that allow editors of movies and TV shows to manipulate the images , voices and surroundings of the stars . Avid has won 45% of a professional computer-based editing and special-effects global market , worth $1 billion last year and expected to double by 2005 . Its closest competitor , Discreet Logic , a division of Autodesk based in Montreal , has 30% of the market . Sony and Matsushita have managed to win only 15% , even though they dominate electronics hardware . <P> How does little Avid , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion Sony and $40 billion Matsushita ? For starters , the company carved out its niche early by mastering the difficult art of making its product easy to use . " Avid is the most intuitive editing environment on the market , " says Gene Munster , an analyst at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray . Tim Squyres , film editor for Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon , says , " Avid 's software has gone through many revisions of being designed to accommodate editors . " <P> Movies used to be edited by physically cutting and pasting together individual frames of film . Avid 's Media Composer software , launched in 1989 , offered a revolutionary alternative : film could be translated into digital information and edited on a computer screen . Media Composer , now in its 10th version , belongs to a host of Avid software that controls everything from sound to 3-D effects . But the company 's original appeal is the same . Its programs incorporate elements like a rotating paddle  --  which mimics a device used in traditional film editing  --  and language such as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are deposited . <P> To demonstrate , Avid effects specialist Kent Petersen clicks on a video clip of two actors walking against a blue backdrop . Petersen points his cursor to a scene of a grassy field , drags it over the icon of the clip , and suddenly the actors are strolling through the field . Something 's missing , though . Petersen pulls down an editing menu and clicks , and shadows appear behind the actors . <P> At Avid 's headquarters , a trophy case displays an Oscar , an Emmy and a Grammy awarded to the company 's software . One wall celebrates the company 's 108 patents . Posters of such movies as Crouching Tiger and Titanic line the halls , and the conference rooms bear names like The Matrix . Each title used Avid systems . Says company president David Krall : " You 're able to trick the mind into seeing things that it believes are real . It 's the highest art form .
