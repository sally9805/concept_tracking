The Book of Dead Birds A Novel Chapter One I remember the first time I flew . I was four years old . My mother decided to take me to Balboa Park for the afternoon . I watched the back of her short-sleeved blouse as we crossed the parking lot to the playground ; the sky-blue fabric tightened , then loosened , tightened , then loosened , across her shoulder blades , pointy as chicken wings . I tried to catch up , but my mother was too fast . Even then , I knew she did n't like to be seen with me in public . I knew it was because of my skin  --  so much darker than my mother 's , dark like the treats she made out of dates that morning , the ones that stuck between my teeth , filling my mouth with a prickly sweetness . We did n't go to the park very often , but this day was special  --  New Year 's Eve , 1975 . Not December 31 , when midnight bullets flew through our San Diego neighborhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few weeks later  --  the lunar New Year , the Korean New Year , the day when girls stand up on seesaws and swings . At four , I was already as tall as my mother 's ribs . I broke into a run and tugged at my mother 's shirt , pulling it out of the elastic waistband of her lime-green pants . She shook herself loose and kept walking . I could see the scar on her lower back as her shirt flapped up  --  a crescent moon , beaded with pale tooth marks . I reached to swipe a finger over it , but she walked even faster . She let me catch up to her when we reached the grass . Without looking at me , she looped two fingers around my wrist and guided me over to the swings . She lifted me by the armpits with a grunt and deposited me , standing , on a swing strap . I clutched the chain while she moved the swing lightly back and forth , but I could n't keep my balance . I wobbled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure no one was watching , then shifted me onto her hip and lurched over to the seesaw . With her foot , she tilted one end of the peeling yellow plank to the ground ; I grabbed on to her sleeves . " No , Omma ! " I yelled , as she set me , standing , on the edge . " You stay here . " She twisted herself away from my grip . " Omma ! " I jumped off the seesaw . The plank rose into the air . She pushed it down again and set me back on . " You stay now . " Her voice was firm . I could n't breathe as I watched my mother walk to the other side of the playground . I wanted to step off the seesaw but my feet felt bolted to the plank . When she finally stopped and turned around , my throat filled with air . " Omma ! " I spread out my arms . She began to run toward me . I had never seen my mother run before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mouth sway loose and her small breasts swing around as she came closer . Then she jumped . She jumped as if there were a trampoline in the grass . She shot up so high , I worried she might get tangled in the jacaranda branches above . There was a determination in her eyes that scared me . It scared her , too . I could see her hesitate as she began to fall . She pedaled her feet backward like a cartoon character who realized he had just walked off a cliff , but she landed on the seesaw anyway , a crumpling blur of limbs . That 's when I flew . I flew straight over my mother 's head , flew like a bullet across the playground . I felt as if I would n't ever stop , as if I would keep on flying , past the park , past the zoo and the stores and the ocean . I felt as if I would be a flying girl forever . Then a eucalyptus tree zoomed toward my face . My mother tackled me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molting trunk . Neither of us spoke on the car ride home . We barely even breathed  --  it felt as if one loud exhale would make some invisible seesaw between us lose its precarious balance . As soon as we got into the apartment , I stumbled off to bed . I felt my end of the ghost board clatter to the ground , felt my mother float untethered behind me as I drifted into a deep , dark nap . When I woke , my whole head throbbed . My forehead had banged into the dirt pretty hard when we fell . In the gray light of dusk , I could see my mother sitting by the window , rocking a bit , as if she had to go to the bathroom . " Omma . " My voice was a puff of air . My mother turned toward me , then crept up to the bed . Something about her looked different , scary . Her eyebrows , I realized , were completely white . She had put some kind of powder on them ; flecks of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After I walked to the bathroom , I was startled to find my own eyebrows white , as well . They looked strange on my much darker face , like a powdered sugar decoration , frosting on a gingerbread cookie . A scrape ran across my forehead , an oblong abrasion , speckled pink and red . I touched a finger to it ; pain shot behind my eyes . I began to feel dizzy . My mother grabbed me by the arms and led me back to bed . " If you take nap at New Year , " she told me as she tucked me under the covers , " the story says your eyebrow turn white . Is joking to put on flour if you fall asleep . " My mother did n't look happy to me , not like someone telling a joke . " Did you fall asleep , Omma ? " I asked . She shook her head . A tear carved a streak through the light dusting of flour on her face ... The Book of Dead Birds       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
