// Hurtling toward American Idol 's hotly anticipated climax , finalists Kelly Clarkson , Nikki McKibbin and Justin Guarini savor living large in a mansion equipped with a personal chef ( and an on-call shrink ) Sunup on L.A. 's Mulholland Drive and the only evidence Tamyra Gray ever dwelled here with the other American Idol finalists is a note she left behind , like some message from a reality-TV ghost . Neatly printed in red marker on an erasable white board , it can be found in the kitchen of the 13  --  bedroom playhouse that serves as home to the finalists of the popular FOX talent competition . " Hello guys , " it reads . " I am not good at goodbyes .... You are all so special , gifted and talented . Let this be your best week ever on this show . No need 4 stress or worries . Have fun . I so do n't want any of you 2 be stressed this week . " It 's very Tamyra , sweet and thoughtful . But no need 4 stress ? Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gray , to many ears the most accomplished pop stylist on Idol , left the house Aug. 22 , less than 24 hours after millions of call-in voters unexpectedly gave the 23-year-old from Norcross , Ga. , the boot-provoking howls of disbelief across an Idol-worshipping nation . ( The audience for the show has grown steadily to more than 15 million . ) Fellow contestant RJ Helton , 21 , endured the same ritual the previous week . " We have a couple hours to pack and leave by Thursday morning , " he says . " I cried the entire time . " What with their waking hours packed with song rehearsal , voice coaching , wardrobe selection , promotional appearances and daydreams of CDs flying out of stores-the top prize is a recording contract-no one at Idol Manor has time to mourn Tamyra this morning . By the time this article hits newsstands , in fact , there will be but two finalists , destined to face off in an hour  --  long pop-song duel Sept. 3 . The winner will be revealed the next night in a two-hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas , is hunting around for throat lozenges . By now her voice is so frayed she downs a capful of olive oil before singing . " I take it the hard way , " she says . " It 's very , very nasty . " Justin Guarini , already a pop idol to the girls who scream his name when he steps out of limos at events , needs to go accessory shopping . Thanks to a little water and moisturizer , his cloud of dark-blond curls has already sprung to full attention . " It 's easy , " says the 23  --  year-old from Doylestown , Pa . " It kind of does its own thing . " Nikki McKibbin , 23 , the vermilion-haired , tongue-pierced , rough  --  singin ' gal from Grand Prairie , Texas , is trying to decide on which color-or , not one for understatement , colors  --  to wear for a photo shoot . She may also have , oh , a concern or two about her survival chances . On the Tuesday-night concert shows , she has stood there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of praise ) from the celebrity judges : singer-dancer Paula Abdul , record producer Randy Jackson and brickbat-hurling British music exec Simon Cowell . On the Wednesday broadcasts , where hosts Ryan Seacrest and Brian Dunkleman reveal the results of the viewers ' phone-in vote , Nikki has consistently , barely skirted doom , like a French noblewoman in a punk wig expecting to be summoned to the guillotine . " I 'm sure I 'm out , " she whispered to Seacrest on Aug. 21 . But this morning Nikki is surprisingly calm and in control , makeup off and girlish freckles exposed . " I 'm not a tough , gripey rocker child , " she says . " I 'm a very quiet person . " A single mom ( to Tristen , 4 , who 's home in Texas ) , Nikki says she 's used to getting by on little sleep . Besides , " This is all just so normal now . " Photograph Justin , starting the day with cereal , finds washing his own dishes " kinda therapeutic . " // To anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives transformed overnight . " The pressure is amazing , " says Randy Jackson . " Two months ago they were just kids trying to make it . " When Idol producers began their open auditions last spring , Justin was selling home-alarm systems door-to-door , Nikki was staging karaoke parties at bars , and Kelly was a cocktail waitress . Now actors on other FOX series sometimes seem like fans . " You would be such a huge Broadway star , " Malcolm in the Middle 's Jane Kaczmarek told Kelly . But the pace is so exhausting , even with a small fleet of personal assistants and chauffeurs , " there are days I just do n't shower , " says Kelly . Lately , she has managed on as little as three to four hours ' sleep . " I do worry about them , " says Idol 's co-executive producer Nigel Lythgoe . " The stress level of learning songs and performing them live on television is huge . Most artists never do that in a lifetime . " Which is why the show keeps a psychologist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them regularly . ) Forget the Freud , says Simon Cowell : " They 're about to become rich and famous-we should all have that pressure . " Paid an undisclosed fee per show ( plus a lump $2,000 sum for clothes ) , the final 10 will all sing on ( and receive royalties from ) a compilation album . In October they 'll reunite for a concert tour . Above all these kids are living out their dreams . " I 've spent 23 years preparing for this , " says Justin , who was 4 when he made his singing debut in a boys ' choir . " I could be sitting at a desk or in a cubicle . I 'd go insane . " He definitely would n't have taken up temporary residence in a rented 13,500-sq. - ft. mansion that makes MTV 's Real World look like a dormitory of painted cinder block . " It 's a total bubble , " says Seacrest , although Justin prefer to calls it " our sanctuary . " With sweeping views of the San Fernando Valley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacuzzi and steam room ( " my favorite thing in the morning , " says Kelly ) , plush furniture in hip colors-chartreuse and purple-two big-screen TVs , a rowing machine , a treadmill , a Foosball table and a laundry room . A chef prepares meals to order . ( Justin and Kelly will have steak tonight , but Nikki does n't eat red meat : chicken for her . ) The kitchen is stocked with snack staples : Cap'n Crunch , Oreos , peanut butter , jelly , processed cheese slices , ice cream . Kelly often grabs honey-wheat bread and whips up a sandwich-turkey , ham , mustard , mayo and corn chips to add crunch : " I make " em good . " She has more elbowroom at the kitchen counter as the number has dwindled from 10 finalists on July 16 to these last three . No more game nights playing Twister and Cranium . The staircase that once echoed with the footsteps of Ryan Starr , 19 , running up and down to exercise is silent . " It is a little lonely now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minor tiff with Ryan over picking a costume . Kelly , who shared a bedroom with Tamyra Gray and Christina Christian , 21 , now has it all to herself . " But I miss them , " she says . Photograph Justin Guarini As a little boy Justin spent so much time on the job with his father , former Atlanta police chief Eldrin Bell , 66 , the officers called him Little Chief . " There were times Justin would be in his pajamas in the backseat of my cruiser at night , " Bell recalls . By the time he was in preschool , Little Chief wanted to be Big Star . " He never had any qualms about getting in front of a camera , " says stepsister Dianna Beach , 44 , who got to know Justin after he moved to Doylestown , Pa. , at age 51/2 to live with his mom , Kathy , 53 , a former TV journalist , and her new husband , retired physicist Jerry Guarini , 69 . " His voice was almost angelic . " Unlike his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also happens to be a distant cousin of actor Samuel L. Jackson 's wife  --  put his showbiz dream on hold until he finished Central Bucks East High . But Bell had already given him the advice that today serves him so well on Idol : " I said , Smile ! Even if they run you out of town , you 'll look like you 're leading a parade . " ' // The finalists , who hug and cheer as if they were an Olympics team , claim this is genuine affection . " We 've been through so many emotional ups and downs , " says Christina , who set the housemates ' waterworks gushing when a sinus infection forced her into the hospital on Aug. 7 . " It all brought us together . " Not together enough to spark any romances-she and Nikki regard Justin " as a brother , " says Kelly . Yet even so , says Justin , the friendships are " strange and wonderful , " sort of ordinarily humdrum too . When the gang heads out to Blockbuster , they pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who will win seems genuinely up in the air . Fans have been disturbed by the news that several hundred callers , taking advantage of high-tech computer connections , are able to cast 10,000 votes apiece in a single night . The producers , however , say this has not had a skewing effect . Has Nikki hung on because America loves the underdog ? Early top dog Justin came close to losing after giving off too much attitude one week : appealing to the studio audience over the head of Cowell , who had n't liked his version of " Sunny . " Justin apologized on air the next week . " That was my low point , " he says . " I realized , This is not who I am . " Photograph Nikki McKibbin " I knew before she was born she was a rocker , " says her mother , Teresa McKibbin , 45 , back home in Grand Prairie , Texas . Six months pregnant with Nikki when she attended a Fleetwood Mac concert , she felt the baby moving inside her . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving . " Recently separated from husband Joshua Ozment after a year of marriage , Nikki is herself a mom , and " all her free time is spent with Tristen , " says Teresa of Nikki 's 4-year-old son with an ex-boyfriend . " She takes him to Chuck E. Cheese 's and Six Flags . " And Idol . When cameras caught Tristen crying in his grandma 's arms on Aug. 13 , some wondered if he was upset by what mean old Simon Cowell said to his mommy . Not to worry , Simon . " Tristen is only 4 , " explains Teresa . " He was told he could go backstage with Nikki , then she left the stage without him . " Photograph Photograph // Tamyra has no such doubts . " I managed to do what I set out to do  --  get my voice heard , " she says . Already signed to a management contract by the show 's producers , she earned the praise of no less than pop king Burt Bacharach . " She was as good as anybody I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now the remaining competitors are determined to win the hearts of America and ( if he has one ) Simon Cowell . This morning no one notices as an assistant takes a cloth to the message board and erases Tamyra 's sweet farewell . After all , they 've got a show to do . " There are times you want to get away , " says Guarini . " But I would n't trade this for anything . " * Tom Gliatto * Alexis Chiu , Pamela Warrick and Teena Hammond in Los Angeles , Steve Helling in Atlanta , Bob Calandra in Doylestown and Alicia Dennis in Texas Photograph Kelly Clarkson Friends recall two things about Kelly , who lives in Burleson , Texas , with mother Jeanne , 51 , and stepfather Jimmy Taylor , 53 . One : Though she always had that voice , she was shy about showing it off . ( Once , says pal Lindsay Hope , 20 , " she turned her back before she sang to me . " ) That obviously has changed .

" A lot of times she would n't answer the door , and I had to climb over her fence to throw stuff at her window . " That has n't changed . Terrified of sleeping through her Idol audition , Kelly stayed up all night . At 4 a.m. , says Jessica Huggins , 23 , " She was throwing rocks at my window . " // <p>
