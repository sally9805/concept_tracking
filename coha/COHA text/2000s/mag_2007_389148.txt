Roboticist Hod Lipson wants you to stop shopping and use his portable invention box to make your own stuff . AS A CHILD , Hod Lipson lost Lego pieces constantly . Now the 39-year-old director of Cornell University 's Computational Synthesis Lab can build replacement parts on the spot . Completed last year , Lipson 's fabrication machine , called a " fabber , " can print thousands of three-dimensional objects , everything from toy parts to artificial muscles , using dozens of materials , including PlayDoh , peanut butter and silicone , by following simple directions sent to it by a PC . About the size of a microwave , the fabber costs $2,300 to assemble  --  roughly one tenth the cost of commercial 3-D printers . Lipson and his graduate student Evan Malone recently launched a Web site called Fab@Home ( fabathome.org ) to teach people how to build their own fabbers and encourage them to share their blueprints online . As a result , amateur inventors worldwide are now manufacturing their creations from the comfort of their own homes . The duo 's next step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as robots , complete with circuit boards . As soon as a robot walks out of the printer , Lipson says , Malone can walk out of the lab with his Ph.D . Q : What sort of things are people printing with your fabber ? A : Watchbands , squirt bottles , batteries , artificial muscles , even fancy chocolates . What you print is really up to you . Q : How long does it take to print something like a Lego piece ? A : About two hours . The printer is n't fast or efficient , but you do n't need to know a thing about manufacturing to use it . Q : Would n't it be cheaper , faster and easier to just go buy a new piece ? A : The only way to make something cheaply today is to have it mass-produced . For example , you wear the same shoes as everyone else . If you had a fabber , you could custom-make shoes that perfectly fit your feet . Three-dimensional printing will help us move away from the mass consumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : You 've said you 're taking a lesson from the Altair 8800 , a do-it-yourself computer kit that inspired the PC . Why ? A : Similar to computer technology in the ' ' 60s , 3-D printing is a universal technology that has the potential to revolutionize our life by enabling individuals to design and manufacture things . Worrying about how you 're going to make something is a huge constraint  --  most people ca n't make anything at home because it 's too expensive . We want as many people as possible to get their hands on this technology , experiment with it , improve it , and develop new applications for it . Q : With all of the programs and product designs posted on Fab@Home , are you making a profit ? A : We 've put everything out in a completely free way , no limitations . The Altair people never became rich , but they made history . We 're after that kind of impact . We just want people to use the technology to free their design creativity . Similar to sharing MP3s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site . Maybe someday they 'll earn 99 cents every time their blueprint is printed . Q : That sounds like an intellectual-property nightmare . A : Oh yeah . This is going to make M copyrights look like a piece of cake . Q : Noy Schaal , a high-schooler in Kentucky , won first prize at a science fair for using a fabber to build a chocolate map of the Bluegrass State . Is she the kind of everyday user you have in mind ? A : Noy is an excellent example of how you can explore the fabber without much training . I 'm really hoping this will pass the geek barrier . I want the technology to reach people who want to make cool stuff out of exotic materials but have no way of doing it . For example , you can put cheese in the fabber but not in a conventional manufacturing machine because you 'll void its warranty . The fabber is more about allowing designers to experiment with ideas than making anything in particular . Q : What 's the most extreme use you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want a printer to be all we need to send on long-term space explorations . After landing , it would print a robot that could walk out of the printer , batteries included . If the robot discovers a cave that requires a special tool to explore with , it could head back to the printer to make the right gadget . And if the robot breaks , just print another one .
