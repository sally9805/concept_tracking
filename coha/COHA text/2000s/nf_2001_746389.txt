The purpose of this study was to describe the cognitive appraisals and concomitant coping strategies following selected sources of acute stress among 52 youth sports competitors , including 36 males and 16 females who volunteered to participate in the study . Using a structured personal interview technique , participants were provided with a 10-item list of possible sources of acute , game-related stress experienced infield hockey , each followed by a specific personal example of that stressful situation . Then , cognitive appraisals of each stressor , categorized as positive or negative , and the athletes ' use of approach or avoidance coping strategies were determined , also obtained from a structured interview and qualitative data analyses . The results showed that receiving a bad call from the umpire and making a physical game error were the two most frequently cited and intense sources of stress for both males and females . In addition , after experiencing most stressors , the athletes tended to make negative cognitive appraisals ( 72% and 58% for males and females , respectively ) followed by an avoidance coping strategy . Approach coping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive appraisals . Supporting the transactional coping model , the use of appraisals and coping strategies was dependent on the type of stressful event . The results suggest that examining positive and negative appraisals and approach and avoidance coping strategies forms an appropriate conceptual framework in future research in understanding the coping process among child athletes . <p> Stress is a persistent and inherent feature of the youth sport environment ( Goyen &; Anshel , 1996 ) , primarily due to high , often unrealistic , expectations of parents and coaches and the pressure to perform at high quality levels ( Scanlan &; Passer , 1979 ; Smoll &; Smith , 1996 ) . For many years , chronic forms of stress among younger athletes has received widespread recognition as an impediment to satisfaction and continued participation ( Orlick &; Botterill , 1975 ) . Sources of and coping with acute stress , however , has not been widely examined in the sport psychology literature , in general , and among younger athletes , in particular . Acute forms of stress are a particular problem in sport among younger athletes as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relative lack of sport skills in this age group and a plethora of performance errors , children have not learned adaptive coping skills that exacerbate the effects of an already inherently stressful environment ( Frydenberg &; Lewis , 1993 ; Gould , 1993 ) . As a result , the satisfaction and enjoyment that usually forms the basis of a child athlete 's initiative to participate in sport is likely to become undermined ( Smoll &; Smith , 1996 ) . <p> Coping consists of a person 's conscious attempt at managing the demands and intensity of events perceived as stressful or improving one 's personal resources ( e.g. , positive affect , confidence , self-control ) in attempting to reduce or manage one 's perceived stress intensity ( Lazarus , 1999 ) . One critical mediator of an athlete 's selection of coping strategies is his or her cognitive appraisal of the event or situation . According to an extensive review of the related literature , Lazarus ( 1999 ) acknowledges the importance of appraisals and the subsequent use of coping strategies as critical factors in explaining a person 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the coping process in youth sports has been virtually nonexistent . Because children differ markedly from adolescents and adults in their cognitive development and coping skills ( Compas , 1987 ) , this area requires extensive attention by sport psychology researchers . <p> The areas of appraisal and coping have been studied under various conceptual frameworks . Traditionally , Lazarus and Folkman 's ( 1984 ) model has provided the most common framework in the study of cognitive appraisal following stressful events . The authors posit that coping is required only following events that are perceived as stressful , while benign or positive cognitive appraisals do not require coping . Stressful appraisals are further categorized as harm/loss , threat , or challenge . Harm/loss appraisals refer to physical or psychological damage already sustained , including an incapacitating injury or illness , loss of a valued/ loved person , or recognition of a damage to self-social esteem . Threat appraisals refer to the person 's expectations of future harm or losses , while challenge appraisal reflects the opportunity for growth or mastery in an encounter , and the potential for benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitement , exhilaration , and eagerness , while threat appraisals focus on the potential for harm , and are characterized by negative emotions , such as fear , anxiety , and anger . The importance of acknowledging the athlete 's appraisals is their direct impact on the individual 's emotional response to the stressful event , to the type of coping strategy the athlete selects , and to the effectiveness of that strategy ( Hardy , Jones &; Gould , 1996 ; Smoll &; Smith , 1988 ) . <p> The Lazarus and Folkman model of harm/loss , threat , and challenge may be inappropriate for examining the coping process in child athletes . Perhaps a more simplified framework in youth sport research , positive and negative appraisal , for instance , might provide more accurate recall of cognitive appraisal following stressful events experienced during previous sports events . One implication for using a positive and negative appraisal framework , according to Krantz ( 1983 ) , is that " relatively positive appraisals of coping options may have their effect on behavior through the reduction of anxiety .. , or through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would appear , then , that a simplification of the appraisal framework would improve the accuracy of recall among younger athletes , and enhance our understanding of the relationship between a child athlete 's appraisal of the stressful event and his or her subsequent coping response ( Hardy et al. , 1996 ; Krantz , 1983 ) . <p> The association between cognitive appraisal and the subsequent use of coping strategies as a function of the type of stressful event has been a salient omission from the extant sport psychology literature . Inherent in the transactional coping model , personal and situational factors interact to produce a coping response that is unique to situational characteristics and demands ( Lazarus , 1999 ) . This model also is relevant to sport situations ( Smoll &; Smith , 1988 , 1996 ) . An athlete 's appraisal of an event is closely linked to his or her subsequent use of coping strategies - or , if the event is not perceived as stressful , to not have to cope at all . For example , use of a coping strategy may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not stressful ( i.e. , irrelevant or benign ) or only slightly stressful , if , however , the event is appraised as highly stressful , then the content of that appraisal ( e.g. , positive or negative , harmful , threatening , or challenging , controllable or uncontrollable ) will partially determine the athlete 's selection and effectiveness of a coping strategy or set of strategies ( Lazarus , 1999 ) . It is surprising , then , that the association between appraisal and coping has been virtually ignored in the extant sport psychology literature ( Hardy et al. , 1996 ) . <p> One framework with which coping has been studied in the existing sport psychology research literature consists of approach and avoidance ( e.g. , Anshel , 1996 ; Anshel &; Wells , 2000 ; Anshel , Williams , &; Hodge , 1997 ; Krohne &; Hindel , 1988 ) . Krohne ( 1993 ) suggests that most approaches to classify coping responses distinguish between those strategies active in nature designed to confront the problem , and those strategies involving an effort to reduce tension by avoiding dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study of coping style involves the concepts of approach ( also called engagement , vigilance , sensitization , and attention ) , and avoidance ( also referred to as repression , desensitization , inattention ; Krohne , 1993 ; Roth &; Cohen , 1986 ) . <p> Approach coping is the process of taking " active steps " to alleviate the effects of the stressor , or those strategies characterized by an " orientation toward threat-relevant aspects of a situation " ( Krohne , 1993 , p. 11 ) . Examples of approach coping may include increasing efforts to reduce stress intensity , initiating direct action , seeking information to explain the source of stress or prevent its reoccurrence , and pre-planning a coping strategy . Roth and Cohen ( 1986 ) suggest that approach coping is preferable when : ( a ) the situation is controllable , ( b ) the source of the stress is known , or ( c ) when the outcome measures are long term and necessitate remaining " on task " even after the period of inactivity following the stressor . For example , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coach for advice to prevent the same mistake occurring again ( e.g. , " How can I prevent them from successfully using that play again ? " ) , take responsibility for the error ( e.g. , " I should have had that one coach " ) , and/or analyze the problem and plan for a different response in the future ( Anshel et al. , 1997 ) . These strategies allow the athlete to regain control of the unpleasant situation . Instead , however , the athlete may decide to use avoidance coping by ignoring the situation such as receiving a coach 's reprimand or an unpleasant response from spectators . <p> Avoidance coping entails " turning away from the threat related cues " ( Krohne , 1993 , p. 21 ) . Examples of avoidance coping include avoiding a stressor by seeking other company as a distraction , discounting the importance of/or ignoring the stressor , and engaging in another task rather than the present task ( Endler &; Parker , 1990 ) . Roth and Cohen ( 1986 ) suggest avoidance coping is preferable when ( a ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ esteem/confidence , low- optimism ) , ( b ) the source of the stress is not clear , ( c ) the situation is uncontrollable , or ( d ) when the outcome measures are short term or immediate . For example , after a " wrong call " from the umpire or referee when the contest is ongoing , the athlete needs to remain " on task " and avoid becoming distracted by the stressor ( i.e. , the wrong call ) . An avoidance coping strategy is therefore most warranted when the source of the stress is externally controlled , because confronting the stressor will rarely improve the situation or the outcome in such circumstances ( Krohne , 1993 ) . When the duration of the stressor is taken into account , in general , avoidance coping is often more effective for short-term stressors ( i.e. , one week or less ) , while approach coping is more effective for stressors exceeding one week in duration . Approach and avoidance coping has been supported using confirmatory factor analysis in previous sport-related studies ( e.g. , Anshel , 1996 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Anshel , &; Caputi , 2000 ) . <p> One factor that will dictate the athlete 's selection of a coping strategy is the source of stress to which it is linked , in one sport study , Anshel and Wells ( 2000 ) found that approach and avoidance coping styles , that is , the athletes ' disposition toward using one particular type of coping strategy , was a function of the type of stressor experienced in basketball games . Physical abuse from an opponent initiated an approach coping strategy , while a " bad " call from the referee resulted in avoidance coping , since nothing could be done to change the situation . There is no shortage of research in sport psychology examining sources of stress for athletes in various competitive sports , including basketball , ( Madden , Summers , &; Brown , 1990 ) , figure skating ( Scanlan , Stein , &; Ravizza , 1988 ; Gould , Jackson , &; Finch , 1993a ) , college baseball and softball ( Anshel , Gregory , &; Kaczmarek , 1991 ) , golf ( Cohn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1978 , 1979 ) and wrestling ( Gould , Horn , &; Spreeman , 1983 ) . However , two limitations of these studies has been the lack of differentiation between acute and chronic sources of stress , and the failure to link sources of stress to the athlete 's appraisal and coping strategy . As Dewe ( 1992 ) claims in his study of appraisal and coping in the organizational psychology literature , " the two processes ( appraisal and coping ) are highly interdependent and influence each other during any encounter . Distinguishing between them serves to provide a common pathway and , thus , perhaps a mechanism for ordering and bringing together the different variables that make up the stress process " ( p. 96 ) . <p> The uniqueness of child athletes , as compared to their more mature , adult counterparts , has long been recognized by researchers . As Smoll and Smith ( 1996 ) contend , children are not miniature adults , and have their own criteria influencing their perception of stress . Frydenberg and Lewis ( 1993 ) agree , contending that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coping research , since most of the work has been reported with adult populations " ( p. 225 ) . Nevertheless , there has been a dearth of coping research among child athletes in the sport psychology literature . Gould ( 1988,1993 ) suggested that learning more about and helping children cope with competitive stress were highly important to help prevent the high dropout rate in youth sport . In one rare sport-related study in this area , Goyen and Anshel ( 1998 ) found that stress intensity and the use of coping strategies each differed significantly as a function of gender , age , and the type of stressful event . <p> According to Sorensen ( 1993 ) , gender is an important mediating variable in children 's stress and coping . However , the results of several non-sport studies on gender differences and coping reveal equivocal results . For instance , although boys and girls do not differ in the number of hassles experienced , apparently they are experienced differently ( Kanner , Feidman , Weinberger , &; Ford , 1991 ; Sorensen , 1993 ) . In several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ al . ( 1998 ) , females are more likely than males to seek , out social support. , Thus , despite a dearth of research in this area , it is apparent that gender is a relevant factor in determining a child athlete 's appraisals and coping responses following stressful events in sport . <p> According to Compas ( 1987 ) , different versions of examining the coping process are needed for various age groups " to reflect changes in cognitive development and response capabilities " ( p. 401 ) . The purpose of this study , then , was to identify the sources of acute stress of young male and female athletes that they perceived as highly intense , and to determine their cognitive appraisals and coping strategies following each of these sources of stress experienced during competitive sports events . It was hypothesized that gender differences would exist on the use of cognitive appraisals , labeled as positive and negative , and coping strategies , each classified as approach or avoidance . Links between athletes ' appraisals and their use of coping strategies were also predicted , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoidance coping . Method <p> Participants <p> The participants in the present investigation consisted of 52 children , 36 males and 16 females , aged 10-12 years , who competed in field hockey in the New South Wales ( Australia ) Junior Hockey Association . Participants were required to complete a consent form that explained the general purpose of the study and informed them that they were able to withdraw from the study at any time without penalty or any hardship to their future participation on the team . The University 's Human Research Ethics Committee approved procedures and interview content . <p> Measures and Procedures <p> We followed the recommendation of Compas ( 1987 ) , who suggests that a structured , open-ended , self-report checklist be developed for researching child stress and coping . A checklist reflects changes in a child 's cognitive development and response capabilities , and is sensitive to the recall of specific situations rather than identifying " usual " coping responses when dealing with children . <p> Each structured interview was comprised of determining the young athletes ' sources of acute stress that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coping strategy employed in response to each identified stressor . The interviews , completed within a period of 20-35 minutes , were usually conducted at the team 's training sessions . Eight of the 52 interviews , however , were conducted by telephone to obtain the athlete 's accessibility . The interviews were tape recorded with the athletes ' permission and later transcribed verbatim . This approach allowed for identifying components of the coping process and a more in-depth description of experiencing stressful events , a particular need for interviewing the present age group , a procedure used by Goyen and Anshel ( 1998 ) . <p> The study consisted of four segments . In Part 1 , the athletes were familiarized with the interview process including an overview of the investigation and the type of questions that would be asked . The athletes were reminded that information gathered would be strictly confidential and that there were " no right or wrong answers . " Stress was defined for each participant as " those times during the game when you were really upset , worried , and annoyed by nasty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the acute stressor on a Likert scale ranging from 1 ( not at all stressful ) to 5 ( extremely stressful ) , a similar procedure used by Long ( 1993 ) in her coping study . <p> Participants were instructed to report only those sources of game stress they would classify as highly intense commensurate with number 4 or 5 on this scale ranging from I ( not at all stressful ) to 5 ( extremely stressful ) to ensure the reported sources of acute game-stress reported were of similar and considerable intensity for the individual participants . Previous researchers ( see Crocker et al. , 1998 , for a review ) have suggested that reporting highly intense stressors would provide a more reliable report of the coping strategies actually employed by participants than low to moderate stress levels . <p> Part 2 of this study focused on the sources of acute stressors athletes have encountered during competition , a procedure used by Anshel and Wells ( 2000 ) . As suggested by Fowler ( 1988 ) , identifying sources of stress were preceded by time frame recall questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stressors experienced ( e.g. , " Do you remember your game last week , " " What team did you play " ) . This procedure also supported Roth and Cohen 's ( 1986 ) contention that the coping process be studied " in the context of knowledge of critical characteristics of stressful events " ( p. 818 ) . <p> To facilitate accurate recall and reduce underreporting of previously experienced stressful events in sport ( Fowler , 1988 ) , participants were provided with a 10-item list of possible sources of acute , game-related stress . All items in this section had been identified as sources of acute stress during sport competition used by Anshel ( 1996 ) , Anshel , Brown , and Brown ( 1993 ) , Anshel et al . ( 1997 ) , and Gould et al . ( 1983 ) . Participants were then requested to provide a specific personal example of that stressful situation they had experienced . As Sorensen ( 1993 ) suggests , reports of stress-coping variables are more accurate when the stress and coping processes actually occurred rather than based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1991 ) clarification probes ( e.g. , " Would you please go over that again , " " How do you mean ? .... Can you give me an example ? " ) were used to induce the participants to repeat and clarify any unclear sources of stress . Each participant was asked the identical sequence of questions . <p> In Part 3 of the study , the participants ' appraisals for each game stressor were identified based on Lazarus and Folkman 's ( 1984 ) appraisal model and adapted to sport settings . As indicated earlier , as suggested by Compas ( 1987 ) , we combined harm/loss and threat appraisals to form a negative appraisal category , with challenge appraisals labeled positive . This was because of the complexity of distinguishing between harm/loss , threat , and challenge appraisals for the recall ability of these young athletes , the absence of sources of stress that warranted a harm/loss appraisal , and improved clarification in interpreting the results . <p> The participants were asked to describe what they " felt " immediately following each source of stress , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( e.g. , " After experiencing a game error what did you think ? " ) . The classification of appraisals reported by participants into negative ( i.e. , harm/loss and threat ) or positive ( i.e. , challenge ) was initially achieved by referring to Lazarus and Folkman 's ( 1984 ) definition of these dimensions , in addition , face validity was enhanced by having two independent academic researchers familiar with the coping literature confirm the classification of each item as reflecting either a negative or positive appraisal . <p> Finally , Part 4 of the study concerned examining the participants ' immediate coping response to each source of acute stress . Again , participants were provided with a list of possible coping strategies to assist in their recall ( e.g. , " I thought about what I would do next , " " I tried to forget the whole thing , " " I talked to my teammates " ) . Once identified , the participant was requested to provide a specific example of their coping strategy based on a list of 10 approach coping items and 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the children 's coping literature in general psychology ( e.g. , Frydenberg 's , 1993 , Adolescent Coping Checklist ; Lazarus &; Folkman 's , 1988 , Ways of Coping Checklist ) and items from inventories used in previous sport psychology research ( e.g. , Anshel , 1996 , Anshel et al. , 1997 ) . <p> When the participants had finished describing their coping responses , they were asked to elaborate on any further coping responses ( e.g. , " How did you handle that ? " or " What did you do next ? " ) . Again , similar to Scanlan et al. , 1991 , the interviewer asked the athlete to clarify or repeat any unclear responses ( e.g. , " Would you please go over that again ? " ) . In addition , content validity for each item was confirmed by asking two researchers familiar with the approach and avoidance framework to confirm the classification of each item as defined by Roth and Cohen ( 1986 ) . They reached 100% consensus on this task . <p> Pilot Interviews <p> Prior to the investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six 10-12 year old athletes , three boys and three girls , who competed in field hockey in the same competition as the athletes participating in the study . The purposes of this exercise were to gain information about the clarity and ease of comprehension of instructions , phrasing of items , and the child 's general understanding of what was being asked of them for both interviews . The pilot interviews were completed prior to or during training sessions in competitive settings . The feedback from the pilot interviews and a review of procedures by the investigators resulted in selected changes to the wording of instructions and addition of items . For example , because it was found that participants were unable to recall sources of acute stress experienced during the game , a list of 10 sources of acute stress was generated as a prompt for the sources of stress questions . The athletes were asked to determine perceived stress intensity on a scale ranging from I ( not at all stressful ) to 5 ( extremely stressful ) , while a score of 3 was labeled moderately stressful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this study were initially contacted through the Club 's Junior Coordinator . The researcher provided a brief description of the investigation and sought permission to contact the teams ' individual coaches . Each team 's head coach was provided a background on the study and permission to approach their players to invite them to participate in the study . The head coaches provided information to their players - that it was voluntary , beneficial , and that all information provided would be strictly confidential - and encouraged them to participate . This was followed by a researcher 's visit to a training session , who again , informed the participants and their parents who attended the training session , about the investigation and invited the athletes to participate . Due to the young age of the athletes , consent was also sought from their parent or guardian , it was explained to the participants that the interview would be held in person , where possible , or over the phone at a time agreeable to the participant and interviewer . Results <p> Qualitative Analyses <p> Following procedures described by Patton ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sport psychology study ( Anshel , 1991 ) , a deductive content analysis was used to classify items into predetermined categories ( e.g. , the list of 10 stressors , positive and negative appraisals , and the 28-item list of coping strategies ) . The frequency and percentage of responses to the 10 sources of acute stress were calculated for males , females , and for the total group to determine the most commonly used and most frequently reported source of stress for both genders . The frequency and percentage of cognitive appraisals and 28 coping strategies for each stressor , categorized as positive or negative and approach and avoidance , respectively , based on a full consensus between the researchers , were identified for males , females , and the total group . Qualitative examples of sources of acute stress , appraisals , and coping strategies were provided in the narrative , as suggested by Krippendorff(1980) . <p> Sources of Acute Stress <p> Examples of sources of stressful events experienced by the child male and female athletes along with qualitative analysis are located in Table 1 . The stressors are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ athletes experienced each stressor . As indicated earlier , the total percentage of players reported for each stressor exceeds the actual percentage of players who reported that stressor because players differed in the number of sources of acute stress they reported . For example , the stressor , " hearing unpleasant comments from the opposition " was reported by 10 males , reflecting 28% of the total male sample ( n = 36 ) . However , this stressor was only 10% of the total number of stressors reported by all males ( n = 101 ) . Further , " a bad call from the umpire " was cited 22 times by 61% of the 36 male participants , reflecting 22% of the 101 total number of stressors . <p> As shown in Table 1 , gender comparison of the sources of stress indicates the most frequent source for both males and females was " a bad call from the umpire " ( 61% and 44% for males and females , respectively ) , followed closely by " making a physical game error " ( 55% and 50% , respectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stress . For example , females reported the stressor " hearing unpleasant comments from the sideline " considerably more than males ( 31% and 14% , respectively ) , and males reported " getting a bad game score " considerably more than females ( 36% , 19% , respectively ) . The percentage of males citing the stressors , " hearing unpleasant comments from coaches " and " hearing unpleasant comments from teammates " were 8% and 11% , respectively , however , these stressors went unreported by females . <p> Several sources of stress , as identified in Table I , were similar among both genders . These included , " sudden success of the opposition " ( 33% and 31% , for males and females , respectively ) , " the pain of sudden injury " ( 28% and 38% , respectively ) , and " unpleasant comments from the opposition " ( 28% and 19% , respectively ) . Frequency of the stressor , " cheating by the opposition , " was also similar for males and females ( 5% and 6% , respectively ) , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In summary , these percentages suggest greater similarity than disparity in the frequency of stressors reported by male and female athletes . <p> Coping <p> Using structured interviews , researchers in the sport psychology literature have identified several common themes and dimensions of sources of stress in competitive sport ( e.g. , Cohn , 1990 ; Gould et al. , 1993a ; Scanlan et al. , 1991 ) . These themes include the " negative aspects of competition , " " demands and costs of competition , " " negative significant other relationships , " " personal struggles involved in competition " , and " miscellaneous . " Using these common themes , the 10 responses to acute stress , listed in Table 1 , were categorized under the two main themes of " negative aspects of competition " and " negative significant other relationships . " In an effort to improve their clarity and coherence , the athletes ' sources of stress responses were adapted ( i.e. , paraphrased ) while maintaining the integrity of each resulting in original statement , a process a 100% consensus by two researchers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " negative aspects of competition . " These included pain of sudden injury ( e.g. , being struck by a baseball ) , making a game error ( e.g. , missing a tackle , missing a shot at goal because of a performance error , and making an inaccurate throw ) , sudden success of an opponent ( e.g. , the opponent 's scoring goals , losing the contest after a number of sudden attacks on goal , aggressive performance by opponents ) , hearing unpleasant comments from the sideline , " bad " calls from the umpire ( e.g. , poor line calls , awarding undeserved short comers and free hits to the opposition , mistakenly awarding the opposition the ball , and the failure of the umpire to notice fouls and give proper penalties ) , and cheating by the opposition ( e.g. , the opposition touched the ball illegally , not admitting the mistake ) . <p> A second source of stress was categorized as " negative significant other relationships . " This included hearing unpleasant comments from the coach ( e.g. , " the coach was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the coach shouting at me for doing something wrong " ) , and hearing unpleasant comments from teammates ( e.g. , " my teammates teased me after making an error , " " my teammates teased me about my weight and size " ) . <p> Appraisals of Acute Sources of Stress <p> The content analyses of the athletes ' cognitive appraisals of stressors are listed in ' Fable 2 . As suggested earlier , the disparity in the total frequency and percentage figures reflects that not all participants reported an equal number of stressors and subsequent appraisals . The results indicated that differences between the negative and positive appraisal types were more pronounced for males ( 72% of all appraisals were negative , 28% were positive ) than females . The female participants also reported more negative than positive appraisals ( 58% and 42% , respectively ) . However , the disparity between these two appraisals was considerably smaller than for males . In summary , the percentage of negative appraisals in response to acute stressors was considerably more than positive appraisals for the total group , 68.3% and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appraisals included , " we should try harder because my opponent should not score " , " I was upset with myself but I thought we could still win " , and " it makes me feel like trying harder " . Females ' negative appraisals included , " it made me feel stupid " , " I should have got up and done what I was supposed to do " , " they were giving our goalie a hard time and I felt sorry for her " , " I thought I 'd let the whole team down " , and " it annoyed me because the umpire did n't do anything about it " . <p> Examples of positive appraisals for males included " I 'll have to try harder and try to score " after making an error and , in response to cheating from the opposition , " it made me feel like I would try to play harder and tougher , .... try and show them how good I am without cheating , " and " we 're just going to not cheat , score goals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included " I felt tense when they tackle you " after being injured and , in response to bad calls , " it made me angry because they got a good break , " " the referee is not very good ; he should n't have made those mistakes " and " I felt annoyed because the Ref did n't call anything . " Negative appraisals in response to a game error included " I was n't concentrating " and " I felt very disappointed in myself . " <p> Coping <p> The frequency and percentage of individuals who reported each coping response , categorized as approach or avoidance , for both males and females are reported in Table 3 , while selected examples of the coping responses identified by the athletes are presented in Table 4 . Participants usually identified more than one coping strategy for each source of stress and , as a consequence , the total number of coping strategies reported often exceeded the number of participants . There were 459 coping responses , including 330 for males and 129 for females , a reflection of differences in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive and negative appraisals are presented in Table 5 . The total number coping strategy for each source of stress ( and appraisal ) . <p> The most frequently reported coping responses from all participants followed an avoidance coping orientation . Examples were " I tried to concentrate on what I had to do next " ( 13% ) , " I tried to forget the whole thing " ( 13% ) , " I did n't let it get to me and tried not to think about it too much " ( 9% ) , " I wished I could change what had happened or how I felt " ( 9% ) , and " I accepted it as there was nothing I could do " ( 9% ) . The four coping responses listed for the stressor pain of injury included " thinking about what to do next , " " thinking it was due to bad luck , " " accepting it as there was nothing the individual could do " , and " wishing the situation would be over . " Again , these responses highlight varied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classified according to the frequency and percentage with which athletes experienced each stressor ( and appraisal of that stressor ) . For example , avoidance coping in response to a negative appraisal after experiencing pain of injury was reported by 26 males , reflecting 72% of the total male sample ( n = 36 ) , but only 8% of the total coping strategies reported by males ( n = 330 ) . Further , the use of an approach strategy in response to a negative appraisal after making a game error was reported by three females , representing 19% of the total female sample ( n = 16 ) , but only 2% of the total coping strategies reported by females ( n = 129 ) . Finally , female athletes did not experience three of the 10 stressors , " unpleasant coach comments , " " unpleasant teammate comments " and " cheating by the opposition . " For male athletes , the two stressors " unpleasant coach comments " and " unpleasant teammate comments " attracted no approach coping responses . <p> As reported in Table 5 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representing 86% and 81% of total coping for males and females , respectively . However , males reported greater avoidance strategies in response to negative appraisals than females , 68% and 47% of total coping , respectively . While , females reported greater avoidance strategies in response to positive appraisals than males , 33% and 18% , respectively . However , there were variations between individual stressors . For example , males favored avoidance strategies in response to negative appraisals for the stressors " pain of injury , " " game error , " " sudden opposition success , " " unpleasant coach comments , " " unpleasant opposition comments , " " unpleasant comments teammates , " " bad umpire calls , " and " getting a bad game score , " represented a range of 2% to 15% of all coping responses for males . Females , however , reported more frequent use of avoidance strategies in response to negative appraisals on the stressors " pain of injury , " " unpleasant sideline comments , " " unpleasant opposition comments , " and " bad umpire calls , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Further , where males favored avoidance strategies in response to positive appraisals for the stressors , " unpleasant comments sideline " and " cheating by the opposition , " these accounted for a range of only 2% to 2% of total coping for males . Females , however , favored avoidance coping strategies in response to positive appraisals on the stressors , " game errors , " " sudden opposition success , " " getting a bad game score , " and " cheating by the opposition , " represented a range of 2% to 9% of total coping for females . <p> The total percentage of approach strategies used by females and males was 19% and 14% , respectively , considerably less than that observed for avoidance coping . Further , the percentage total of approach coping in response to negative appraisals was 9% for both females and males , and 10% and 5% , for positive appraisals , respectively . Thus , female athletes employed approach coping strategies following both negative and positive appraisals more frequently than male athletes . However , variations between genders existed among individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion of approach coping strategies in response to a negative appraisal on the stressors " the pain of injury , " " sudden opposition success , " " bad umpire calls " and " getting a bad game score , " reflecting a range of 1% to 2% of total coping for males . Females , however , reported greater approach coping in response to negative appraisals on the stressors , " unpleasant sideline comments " , " unpleasant opposition comments " , and " bad umpire calls , " representing a range of 1% to 2% of total coping for females . In response to positive appraisals , males employed more approach strategies in response to " game errors " , unpleasant comments from opponents , and " cheating by the opposition . " This reflected a range of only 0.3% to 2% of all male coping . Females reported greater approach coping in response to positive appraisals after " making an error " and " experiencing a bad game score , " from 3% to 5% of all coping for females . <p> In summary , the athletes demonstrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to both negative and positive appraisals . However , the overall percentage use of avoidance strategies in response to negative appraisals was considerably greater for males than females , while females reported a greater use of avoidance strategies in response to positive appraisals . Further , females reported greater use of approach strategies than males in response to both negative and positive appraisals . Thus , gender differences in the use &coping; strategies were more discrepant than similar . Discussion <p> The purposes of this study were to identify sources of acute stress and concomitant cognitive appraisals and coping strategies of male and female competitive field hockey players , ages 10-12 based on structured personal interviews . The results indicated that " receiving a bad call from the umpire " and " making a physical game error " were the two most frequently cited and intense sources of stress for both males and females . These results are supported by the results of previous studies ( e.g. , Gould et al. , 1983 ; Pierce &; Stratton , 1981 ) . For example , Pierce and Stratton found , in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well ( 63% of athletes ) and making a mistake ( 62% ) were the most common sources of stress . Similarly , Gould et al . ( 1983 ) noted that poor wrestling performance ( 42% ) and not performing up to one 's ability ( 30% ) were primary sources of stress . In addition , these investigators also reported an extensive range of stressors experienced and that no stressor was experienced by 100% of all athletes . While the results of the present study supported these previous findings , perhaps not surprisingly , sources of acute stress differed as a function of sport type . <p> For example , " receiving a bad call from the umpire " was the most frequently cited and highest ranked source of stress in our study , representing 61% and 44% of males and females , respectively . This stressor , however , was ranked 22nd out of 33 stressors in a study of elite wrestlers by Gould et al . ( 1983 ) . Further , only 15% of Gould et al . ' s sample reported experiencing this stressor frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study of golfers indicated that the three most frequently reported stressors included playing a difficult shot , playing up to personal standards , and the first " t-shot , " stressors that offer little resemblance to those stressors identified in most other studies . Similarly , Cohn 's ( 1990 ) exploratory study on the sources of stress in youth golf presents another unique situation . Further , golf is an individual , not team , game and , unlike wrestling , is a closed , ( not open ) , skill in which the environment is stable and the athlete initiates movement . Thus , not surprisingly , the sources of stress identified in previous research reflect sport type . One implication of this finding is that future research on coping with sport-related stress should consider the context within which stress is experienced . <p> As previously indicated , the results of this study also showed that the sources of stress were appraised as either negative or positive . The results indicated that the cognitive appraisals of stressors identified by the athletes were largely negative for both males and females @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures reported by each gender . The percent of all appraisals that were negative were 72% and 58% for males and females , respectively . Similarly , positive appraisals for females were 42% , with only 28% for males . Thus , the margin between the percentage of negative and positive appraisals reported by child athletes was considerably smaller for females than males . This disparity may reflect heightened expectations and pressure to succeed in sport among young male athletes , as compared to their female peers ( Scanlan &; Passer , 1978 , 1979 ; Smoll &; Smith , 1988 ) . Experiencing stress during competition , then , would be more intense and potentially damaging to self-esteem among most young males than among most young females . According to Smoll , Smith , Barnett , and Everett ( 1993 ) , boys derive higher self-esteem through sport participation than girls , making them more vulnerable to the deleterious consequences of experiencing adversity during competition . However , further research is needed to confirm this conjecture . <p> The child athletes in this study reported a variety of coping responses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Indeed , participants were not limited to one particular coping strategy and usually identified more than one for each source of stress , as evidenced in the high overall total figures and percentages for coping responses . This finding is consistent with the previous adult coping literature in both general psychology ( e.g. , Compas , 1987 ; Folkman &; Lazarus , 1985 ) and sport psychology ( e.g. , Anshel et al. , 1997 ; Gould , Eklund , &; Jackson , 1993 ; Gould , Finch , &; Jackson , 1993 ; Rawstorne et al. , 2000 ) , in which coping is viewed as a dynamic and complex process that can involve a number of strategies , often in combination . Further , the adolescent coping literature also supports the wide usage of coping strategies by adolescents , without an excessive emphasis or dominance of one or two strategies ( Compas , 1987 ; Frydenberg &; Lewis , 1991 , 1993 ) . These findings may be explained to some extent by the fact that coping strategies are not mutually exclusive , and thus , individuals who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other strategies . <p> In the present study , the most frequently reported coping strategies by participants were largely identical to those strategies and higher order themes previously identified by Gould and colleagues ( e.g. , Gould , et al. , 1993a , b ) . For example , the two highest ranked and most frequently reported coping strategies in the present study , each reflecting avoidance rather than approach coping , were " concentrating on what to do next " and " trying to forget the stressor . " These are similar to the " task focus " and " thought control " coping strategies , respectively , reported in studies by Gould and colleagues . <p> With respect to gender differences , the coping strategy of social support ( i.g. , " talking to teammates " ) was reported similarly by both genders . This result contradicted previous non-sport research in which females use social support as a coping strategy more so than males ( Frydenberg &; Lewis , 1991 , 1993 ) . In sport contexts , however , it is likely that social support is an inherent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smoll &; Smith , 1988 ) . In their review of related literature , Smoll and Smith concluded that a high degree of social support in youth sport results in considerably more resistance to the effects of sport-related stress , in addition , social support is more compatible with stressful situations that are not time-limited . How , then , would social support be a coping strategy compatible with competitive field hockey , which is time-limited ( i.e. , a continuous , unstable environment ) ? it is feasible to surmise that social support would serve as a buffer against stress , particularly among younger athletes whose coping skills are underdeveloped , by providing a more positive interpersonal environment ( Smoll &; Smith , 1988 ) . <p> The results of the present study partially supported earlier findings on gender and coping related to the content of self-talk to regulate emotions ( Spirito , et al. , 1988 ) . For example , we found that females coped by using confidence-building self-talk ( e.g. , " I talked to myself to build up my confidence " ) considerably more than males @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and feel better " was used similarly by both genders . <p> The current study also revealed that wishful thinking was a primary coping strategy for both males ( e.g. , " I wished I could change what had happened , " " I wish I could change how I felt " ) and females ( e.g. , " I wished the situation would be over or go away " ) . Previous findings are equivocal in this area in the general psychology literature . Frydenberg and Lewis ( 1991,1993 ) and Spirito et al . ( 1988 ) found that wishful thinking was used more by females than males , while Stark et al . ( 1989 ) found that males used this strategy more than females . Males also used resignation as a coping strategy more than females ( e.g. , " I reminded myself that things could be much worse , " " I accepted it as there was nothing I could do " ) . Females , on the other hand , more often than males " tried to forget the whole thing . " Nevertheless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this study were more similar than different in their respective coping responses . The primary responses used by both genders consisted of concentrating on immediate task demands and discussing the situation with teammates . <p> Also examined in the present study was the extent to which approach and avoidance coping strategies would be related to their positive or negative appraisal of that stressor . Negative appraisals were associated with less approach coping , while positive appraisals were associated with decreased avoidance coping . While the correlations between these variables were low to moderate , it also is apparent that the extent of these reactions was more consistent following some stressors more than others . The links between appraisals and coping , and effectiveness of stress management training are needed areas for additional research . <p> The primary limitation of this study was the timing at which athletes were asked to recall sources of and their reactions to specific stressful events experienced during competition . The child athletes were asked to recall sources of stress the previous week of competition , as opposed to immediately after the game . The reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for interviews prior to , but not immediately after , games based on parental demands . Car pooling of athletes , the need to complete home-related tasks ( e.g. , dinner , homework ) , and the athlete 's post-game fatigue further reinforced the immediate post-game departure of athletes . Attempts to recall stressful events from the previous week , as opposed to immediately after the game , likely inhibited the athletes ' recall of information required for this study . While the need to supply the competitors with a list of stressors was further testimony of this limitation , prompting the participants was apparently effective in fostering the recall of and reaction to the stressful events . As Sorensen ( 1993 ) notes " specific , adequately developed , theoretical frameworks related to stress-coping phenomena in children do not yet exist " ( p. 84 ) .
