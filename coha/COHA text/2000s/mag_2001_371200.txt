Those who fight terror for a living know the deal . Success is expected . Failure is intolerable . Last Tuesday was intolerable . Not just because of the volume of destruction and loss of life , but because anyone who has ever tried to keep a secret had good reason to wonder : Given the obvious scope of this terror operation  --  the number of perpetrators/potential leaks , the elaborateness of the preparations/potential money trails  --  how could thousands of spooks who supposedly had Osama bin Laden in their cross hairs for a decade miss every single moving part ? <P> At some point , when the nation has moved beyond grief and vengefulness , CIA Director George Tenet and FBI Director Robert Mueller will have to explain how the $10 billion-a-year anti-terror system failed , and how they can ensure it wo n't fail again . The answer is not a lack of effort . In 1995 Bill Clinton signed a top-secret order authorizing the CIA to run covert operations against bin Laden . Since then his every word has been analyzed , his international network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracked in hopes  --  all vain so far  --  of capturing him . <P> Members of bin Laden 's al-Qaeda network keep electronic communications ( which the U.S. is famously good at intercepting ) to a minimum . They are encrypting more , and when they do use cell phones , it is often in an attempt to smoke out surveillance . " They say things on their phones , then watch us react , " says a U.S. intelligence official . The decentralized design of bin Laden 's network also makes it much harder to penetrate than previous terrorist groups . Many of the countries in which it operates have less than adequate police and intelligence services to provide assistance . It is imbued with a messianic ideology that makes it relatively immune to the lure of cash , the counterspy 's usual inducement . <P> The CIA 's self-improvement could begin with what most experts consider the best if most arduous and dangerous way to disrupt terror : so-called human intelligence , provided by informants and agents . The CIA has long been criticized for its reliance on diplomatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recruit locals in countries like Afghanistan , where the U.S. has no embassy , or Pakistan , where the native spooks keep close tabs on official Americans . Ever since a 1995 uproar about the CIA 's use of Guatemalan informants linked to torture and murder , the agency has been required to perform " human rights " checks on its assets . Last week George H.W. Bush criticized the restriction . " We have to free up the intelligence system from some of its constraints , " he said . The spy game is " kind of a dirty business , and you have to deal with a lot of unsavory people . " But a senior intelligence official counters that no one proposed from the field has ever been turned down because of a human-rights check . <P> The FBI , which monitors al-Qaeda inside the U.S. , has been slammed for lacking deep Muslim contacts , showing excessive caution in penetrating radical groups for fear of violating First Amendment rights , and tolerating office politics that has driven out many of its savviest counterterrorism agents . <P> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to improve the fight against terror , says , " I 'm not sure what can be done other than give us more money and people . " Americans wo n't be satisfied with answers like that .
