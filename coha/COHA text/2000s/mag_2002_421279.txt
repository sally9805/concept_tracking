Why ca n't small business buy a PC that lasts as long as a toaster ? The dramatic changes in the industry today may let them do just that . Photograph // I am a hamster . We all are . For 20 years I have been on a wheel created by the PC industry , constantly feeling behind and racing to keep pace , buying new systems for my one-man software consultancy every 18 to 24 months . Early last year I bought three 500MHz systems that I use for testing computer software and hardware . About 18 months later , the same amount of money will buy 2GHz systems . Some people would conclude that my 50OMHz PCs are outdated jalopies-today 's machines have 300% more processor speed ! - but I think I 'm ready to jump off the wheel . One of the old beefs about computers is their instant obsolescence . Will your new computer still be up to the task two years from now ? How about one year ? These questions have lost their bite , and now everyone from industry analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize that the days of the two-year upgrade cycle are over . Dell gave Wall Street guidance that it expects the slowdown in PC sales to continue until spring 2002 , when businesses may buy new computers to replace the ones bought in the pre-Y2K scare . That would put the new upgrade cycle at about three years . Gartner Group recently revised its recommendations , now suggesting that " power users " upgrade every three years and regular folks every four . Much of this analysis seems based on the fact that the rate of performance improvement in PCs has increased dramatically while normal business software is not demanding more from these burners . However , that 's just one part of the story The increasing reHance on e-mail and the Web for business computing has taken the emphasis off of the desktop . Fast , cheap networking further enables the shift , and improvements in operating systems and network management software mean that a well-designed network can cut support needs and costs . The management software business has n't yet addressed the small business market , but some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sector , still reeling from its burst bubble , has no killer app on the horizon that will add further value to PCs . If you buy the right PCs today and design your network properly , you can set your computer systems not just for the next three years but perhaps for the next decade . The part of this story that folks like Dell and Gartner have caught onto is how the speed of PCs has outstripped the performance needs of the software that runs on them . Consider Microsoft Office XP , the latest version of the most important business application today . Its minimum requirements are a 133MHz or faster processor and , depending on your operating system , up to 64MB of RAM . You 'd have to fire up your WayBack machine if you wanted to buy a new computer this weak . For example , the slowest system Gateway sells these days is a notebook with an 800MHz processor and 128MB of RAM . Processor speed is not really the point anymore anyway . Based on my observations of the systems I run , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreseeable future-for any conventional business application . Rather it 's the amount of memory in the system that should concern you . Random access memory ( RAM ) , which sits on chips and is not part of your hard drive , is where programs and data reside when the computer works with them . If you increase the memory in your systems to between 256MB and 512MB , which should cost between $250 and $400 , you will have the horsepower you need regardless of processor speed . A PC with 512MB of memory is very high-end and will remain so for years . Some applications really do need all the processing power they can get , but they just are n't mainstream business applications . Games top the list , but I doubt that your profits increase with your employees ' Doom scores . For years the PC industry has tried to persuade companies that heavy multimedia was a mainstream business need , but-big surprise ! - adding video and sound to work just adds noise . Design and engineering applications , such as Adobe Photoshop or AutoDesk 's AutoCAD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but only for stressful uses of them , such as very large drawings . When buying PCs , then , even the low end will do well for many of you . In fact , pay close attention to what comes bundled with the system , and feel free to throw anything not relevant to your business needs over the side . High-end 3-D video cards , DVD drives , and TV tuner hardware-all of which have far more uses for employee mischief than for getting work done  --  can go . The cheapest video card and CD-ROM drive will do just fine in a business desktop . In fact , even the CD-ROM drive may be unnecessary , since a desktop on a managed network can load any application or data from the server . Disk space is another area where you can save some money . New desktops tend to come with at least 20GB . That 's more than enough for a normal system , and while doubling or tripling the storage will usually cost less than $100 , unless you know you 'll be installing lots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to load up on M music . The place to put lots of extra storage is on your server , where it can be shared . These same performance trends apply to notebook computers , too , with a few important differences . Notebooks are more fragile than desktop computers , they are harder and more expensive to fix , and most important , they are less easily upgradable . You ca n't easily put in a bigger hard disk , RAM is more expensive , and there 's usually less room for expansion . The fastest processors and biggest hard disks take longer to appear in notebooks as well . So if you 're taking advantage of notebooks for their flexibility in letting you work at home or on the road , expect that they will have shorter life spans than desktops . Like pawns in a game of chess , PCs must be set up properly  --  but hey , they 're just pawns . To extend their life beyond a few years requires a rethinking of your office 's computing environment . In the future , more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the king ) and less on desktop PCs , known as clients . Photograph // For that to work well , you need fast networking to ensure a rapid response between the client and the server . Luckily , fast networks are cheap these days : You can buy all the hardware necessary for a 16-user 100Mbit Ethernet network for about $325 . ( At Buy.com , Netgear 's 16port hub was $123.95 , and SMC 10/100 network cards were $12.59 apiece . ) Almost any program that requires data entry-most notably database applications for maintaining customer records and product information-should run on the server , even if you 're a small shop with just a few users running a simpler database like Microsoft Access . Managing the application will be much easier , and if you connect the database to a Web server , workers will be able to use a browser to input records and view data , and you wo n't have to install and update the whole program on every PC . This may require some custom development , but it 'll be worth it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's known as a terminal server . This is a system in which the programs run on the server itself ; the desktop computer sends keystrokes and mouse movements to the server , and the server does the work , which is sent back to be displayed on the desktop screen . Since the desktop is completely dumb , even " ancient " systems running old versions of DOS , Windows , and non-Microsoft operating systems can run today 's apps . This sort of architecture also makes it easier for remote users  --  working from home , at a branch office , or on the road-to access the network . One of the great things about a terminal server is that you run the software you are used to running . Microsoft Office , Intuit QuickBooks-almost anything that runs on a regular Windows PC-will run on a terminal server . Users ' desktops , files , and applications are no longer tied to a particular computer , perfect for when employees move to a new desk . Microsoft and Citrix dominate this market . Citrix 's tools are better and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is cheaper . Of course , if you 're going to move your programs onto the server , your server has to be up to the task . Whatever you buy should handle the job today but leave room for growth by having space for additional processors and disks , which can significantly improve performance as you rely on your server more . A name-brand server with a high-end processor and room for a second , lots of memory , and plenty of unused space for disk drives should cost an eminently reasonable $3,500 . You 'll also need a fast connection to the Internet so you can take advantage of emerging third-party services , since it may not be feasible to run sales-force-automation and **32;1135;TOOLONG software on your own servers . The companies that can do the job for you , known as application service providers ( ASPs ) , are admittedly a bit downtrodden right now , as potential customers have been reluctant to run business software over the Internet . " We 're going to focus on the existing needs of our existing customers , " says Steve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuing Web-based applications for small businesses . " We 're still excited about the Web , but we 're going to wait until we can prove that this stuff works and that customers want it . " Bennett acknowledges the slow migration to ASPs , but he still believes that this stuff is inevitable . I agree , because it solves so many problems , the biggest of which is the obsolescence of client hardware . Web-based applications let the software vendor , or whoever is hosting the application , maintain and upgrade the application , backup your data , and provide support and access from anywhere much more easily-without having to bother you . They also put almost all the management and performance issues in the hands of the hosting service , and your local systems become " smart " terminals with a much longer life span . Although the limited availability of affordable broadband Internet service for small businesses today will slow this migration to ASPs , in the future your Net connection and outsourcers will help you take the load off your own computers and people . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been the software running on them . Operating systems like Windows 95 and Windows 98 are like the average teenager : There 's a limit to how much you can trust them . Windows 2000 and Windows XP bring a level of reliability and performance to desktop PCs that rivals anything out there and that beats older versions of Windows by a long shot . This improved reliability really comes into play in managing your desktops . Current products are far from ideal , but they 're better than what small businesses had before to manage their PCs , which was nothing . Network administrators have been able to buy management software for many years , from companies like HP , Tivoli ( owned by IBM ) , and Computer Associates , but such software has always been targeted at large enterprises , with the requisite multizeroed price tag . All of these products require substantial expertise to use , the kind that one can only afford with a large IT department . But even without a real network management system , modern network operating systems let you do a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems were designed to be part of a network , your flexibility increases . Administrators can diagnose problems before the user sees them , install programs on the desktops without even visiting them , back up files and system configurations , and so forth . All these capabilities make computers more reliable and easier to support , albeit not as efficiently as if you were using a big , honking system like Tivoli 's . Yet another problem is that finding people who can run this kind of setup can be prohibitively expensive . The answer to the management problem for small businesses will eventually be outsourcing . A full-time network administrator and a full-blown management system may not make sense , but a monthly service for managing your PCs may . Although no management software company would talk on the record about offering conventional management services for smaller companies in the next few years , I did get an acknowledgment that it 's a likely outcome . The management software would run on your systems but be administered remotely by a contractor , such as your value-added reseller ( VAR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rudimentary peek at the possibilities , check out HewlettPackard 's new e-diagtools ( www.hp.com/ desktops/diagtools ) , software that runs on its latest professional PC lines to diagnose hardware problems and report them back to a VAR or HP . For years , analysts have argued whether computers are " fast enough . " Are they yet ? The answer is a qualified yes-only because management software and broadband for small business are not further advanced today . But the trend is quite clear : The era of upgrade after upgrade is coming to a close . Just clean out the crumb tray every once in a while , and your machines will last forever . // Bake-Off : Windows Utility Suites // <p>
