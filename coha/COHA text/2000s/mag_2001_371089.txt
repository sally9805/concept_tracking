The problem for anyone trying to make what Bob Marley once called " rebel music " today is not that there 's too little rebellion out there but , by Western pop culture 's liberal definition , that there 's way too much . Since the dawn of rock ' n ' roll , popular music has been de facto rebellious , at least insofar as the term is defined by record labels and soft-drink ads . All it takes to be a rebel in America , it seems , is to be young and loud . In a music culture where a rebel is the Backstreet Boy with a goatee or the rapper with a lifestyle like a CEO 's  --  where being political means playing party music at the odd benefit for Tibet  --  the mantle hardly seems worth fighting for . <P> The angry rockers and folkies of the ' 60s and ' 70s had it easy : How hard was it , really , to denounce war and societal repression to an audience of kids who had less than selfless motives to want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular music is aimed at largely comfortable , unrestricted youth in a country at peace . The political battlefields , more and more , are economic  --  class conflict , globalism , the environment . So making rebel music in some sense means attacking the pillars of your Nike-clad audience 's own comfort . <P> How , in other words , do you convince listeners with high-tech jobs and PlayStations that they 're working on Maggie 's farm ? Through the ' 90s , that was essentially the mission of Rage Against the Machine , which covered that Dylan classic on its last album , Renegades ( 2000 ) . Apropos of another of its Renegades covers , Kick Out the Jams , Rage aimed to be a modern-day MC5 , using hard-edged music to ram through a hard-nosed message that was less about peace and love than about old-fashioned , **26;13649;TOOLONG populist anger . But they were also one of the few acts in recent years to crack the charts with an unfiltered political message . They were , in their words , " calm like a bomb . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bruce Springsteen have seemed increasingly like museum docents in their recent work , curating the legacy of ' 30s-era populism . <P> But step outside the borders of the world 's hegemon  --  to Africa , the Caribbean , Latin America  --  and you find a different scene : namely , musicians and an audience who really have something to bitch about . Protest music in other parts of the world is complicated by a dynamic unfamiliar to Western listeners . American political music is traditionally an individual 's complaint about the surrounding society . Standing on a street in Lagos or on a beach in Brazil , or staring down an invading army of Pokemon and Britneys , however , it can be equally as radical to speak out for your society . To a protest singer in Mali or Haiti , is the target a government that stifles personal freedoms or a global juggernaut that threatens local traditions and economic autonomy ? Is the oppressor the state , which might jail you for playing your music , or Western entertainment conglomerates , which can so thoroughly marginalize your music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
