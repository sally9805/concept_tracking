Can you get it when you are a grown-up ? How do you get it ? Tell me , how can I help ? It is not fair that people make fun of mentally retarded people . They are still equal , just like us . Why ca n't people just be nice to them ? Peggy Honebrink Mound , Minnesota Dear Peggy : A mental handicap is usually the result of brain damage or a genetic disorder such as Down syndrome .

I 've asked my father , and he told me the more you shave , the hairier your legs become . Is this necessarily true ? I would like to know because many of the girls in my school do shave their legs . Angela Jiatu Dix Hills , New York Dear Angela : Some people think that shaving hair makes it grow faster or thicker . But the hair follicle from where the hair grows just beneath the skin does not change , and the hair just keeps growing its usual way . However , as it grows back in , the new growth , or stubble , usually feels a little rough . The decision to shave your legs is between you and your parents . See you next issue !
