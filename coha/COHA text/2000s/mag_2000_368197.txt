When Randy Roberts first took the case , he knew the odds of embarking on yet another battle against a corporate Goliath . A small-town lawyer from East Texas , Roberts was representing the parents of a 14-year-old girl , Jessica LeAnn Taylor , a junior high school cheerleader who died in a car accident Oct. 16 , 1998 , on the way to a homecoming football game outside her hometown of Mexia , Texas . A friend of Taylor 's mother was driving that day , and as the tread on the left-rear Firestone ATX tire allegedly peeled off like a banana , the Ford Explorer SUV veered left and rolled over . <P> As most tire companies have successfully done in court over the years , Firestone ruled out a problem with the tires from the start . It also fought hard to keep its consumer-complaints data and lawsuits private , saying it knew of only one accident very similar to Taylor 's . But Roberts was n't buying that . On Nov. 22 , 1999 , he secured a crucial victory . In a dramatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over any complaints and other lawsuits , as well as employee depositions from those lawsuits , concerning its ATX and Wilderness tires nationwide . In addition , he permitted Roberts to share the information with lawyers involved in similar legal battles . Though other attorneys , notably Bruce Kaster of Ocala , Fla. , and Tab Turner of Little Rock , Ark. , had been suing Firestone over the same issue for much of the decade , it was Roberts who got the first indication of the scope of the potential defect . According to him , there had been more than 1,100 incident reports and 57 lawsuits by February of this year . It took a while to grab all the spoils  --  Firestone incurred a fine of roughly $9,000 before handing over the testimony of some of its managers on June 22 . " I was ecstatic . I could prove there was a serious problem , " says Roberts . " Otherwise , all I had was a dead teenager . " A trial date has not yet been set . <P> Meanwhile , until February of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) had received fewer than 50 complaints , compiled over the better part of a decade , about the suspect tires , in addition to tips from State Farm that it was seeing an unusually high number of insurance claims for the models . ( This year , according to a State Farm document examined by TIME , the number of cases has been even higher , with 12 appearing in the first four months alone . ) In March , though , 30 to 40 more complaints flooded in after a report on tread-separation accidents aired on Houston TV station KHOU . <P> That piqued the agency 's interest . On April 4 , officials there contacted Roberts . Most product-liability attorneys preferred not to get involved with NHTSA . Once a fierce enforcer of auto safety ( it instigated a massive 1978 recall against Firestone ) , it had become just another underfunded government regulator with little power to police or penalize . Lawyers feared the agency would come up with a whitewash that companies would use in their defense . But Roberts , spurred on by the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job . Through an official , he let the agency know about his discovery , helping galvanize what would become the second largest tire recall in U.S. history , covering Firestone 's 15-in . Radial ATX , ATX II and certain Wilderness models . " Once the cat gets out of the bag , " says one of Roberts ' fellow attorneys , " it 's hard to put it back in. "
