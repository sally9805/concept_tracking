<p> His goal was modest : make no bogeys . His happiest moment was a 12-foot putt for par . And when Tiger Woods won the 100th U.S. Open Golf Championship at Pebble Beach Golf Links , he talked about feeling tranquil . Yes , the great ones do think differently . <p> Woods rewrote U.S. Open history yesterday with a striking display of aggressive yet controlled play , leaving 32,500 gaping spectators and his fellow competitors in awe at what they had witnessed over the past four days . <p> Woods took a record 10-stroke lead after 54 holes and extended it by five to shatter a 101-year Open record for margin of victory by four strokes . He shot a 4-birdie , 0-bogey 67 for a 72-hole total of 272 that tied the Open record for lowest score set by Jack Nicklaus in 1980 and equaled by Lee Janzen in 1993 . <p> Woods established an Open record by winning at 12-under par , a number reached only once previously in an Open , by Gil Morgan in the third round in 1992 , before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in his past 21 tournaments ; he became only the seventh player to win the Masters , U.S. Open and PGA Champi- <p> onship . And he 's still only 24 . <p> " Yes , I won , " Woods said with a wide grin when he entered the interview area . <p> " How great are you ? " someone asked . <p> " I 'll tell you one thing , " Woods said . " I 'm going to try to keep getting better . There are a few things in my game to work on . . . . I 'll probably have a better perspective when I look back when I 'm 60 . " <p> One way to get a grip on Woods ' accomplishments is to look at the company he 's keeping , the game 's greats who during their careers had similar streaks of brilliance . Woods now has won 13 times in the past two seasons : Johnny Miller won 12 times in 1974-75 ; Nicklaus won 14 times in 1972-73 ; Arnold Palmer won 14 times in 1962-63 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time in his career and became the first player to do so in a U.S. Open since Tony Jacklin of England in 1970 . Three others have done that , too . Ever hear of Walter Hagen ( 1914 ) , Jimmy Barnes ( 1921 ) or a guy named Ben Hogan ( 1953 ) ? <p> Woods also joins Miller as the only two players to win both the U.S. Open and the U.S. Junior Amateur championships . <p> " I hate to go back to it , but it all goes back to junior golf , " Woods said , explaining that he learned how to win in that environment . It is one he was exposed to at an early age , of course , his former Green Beret father , Earl , having launched Tiger 's career with garage golf-swing sessions starting at age 2 . <p> Earl Woods , who is in ill health , was not in attendance yesterday , and he and his son are no longer the pair they were when Earl was likening Tiger to a messiah . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my clubs do my talking , " Woods said before acknowledging his father 's contributions to his life and wishing him a happy Father 's Day . <p> Woods said he approached yesterday 's round with the goal of playing with patience , making no bogeys , hitting a lot of greens " and letting the other players know it would be impossible to catch me . " <p> He birdied the 10th , 12th , 13th and 14th holes and had other birdie putts stop " dead-center short " or lip out , but he was most proud of a 12-footer to save par at the 16th hole . " I buried that putt , and it just felt so good , " he said . <p> He followed that with a tap-in par out of the bunker at the 17th , and then set out on his triumphant walk to the record-setting title , one that eclipsed his 12-stroke victory in the 1997 Masters Tournament . <p> " I told Steve ( Williams , his caddie ) walking up 18 , there comes a point in time when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at ease with yourself . And these two weeks , I felt that way , " Woods said . " And for some reason , things just flowed . And no matter what you do , good or bad , it really does n't get to you . <p> " And to have those weeks just happen to coincide with major championships is even better . " <p> Coincidence or not , Woods ' show starting in Thursday 's fog and concluding yesterday was one for the ages . <p> " A perfect display of golf . Just a dominating performance , " said Ernie Els , a two-time U.S. Open champion who had the best seat in the house  --  he was paired with Woods  --  and also the misfortune to be one of the two players who 'll be the answer to a trivia question someday : Who finished 15 strokes behind Tiger Woods in the 2000 Open ? <p> " It 's kind of tough to take , " Els said . " You have to look up at the guy . He 's been compared to Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this stage of his career . " <p> Nicklaus won three majors by the time he was 23 . But he did n't complete a career grand slam until age 26 . Woods , who will not turn 25 until December 30 , can accomplish the slam with a win in the British Open next month at St. Andrews . <p> While waiting for Woods to reach the 18th fairway , some spectators , weary of watching the merely mortal among golf 's elite players , were reduced to entertaining themselves by doing " the wave "  --  surely a first during the final round of a U.S. Open . Normally , these afternoons are full of tension and drama , with contenders working up serious sweats on the practice range , then heading off to do battle . <p> But yesterday 's play was a cakewalk , plain and simple . " I do n't know why it is , people are still doubting this guy a bit , " Rocco Mediate said after finishing with a 77 . " I had people asking me if anyone could catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? As long as he was upright today , he was going to win . I really think he can win 10-15 tournaments a year . He 's that good . " <p> The round began under a typical summer overcast sky with little wind . Defenseless , Pebble Beach surrendered a front-nine 30 and 31 to Richard Zokol and Hale Irwin , respectively . When Zokol , 41 , who has one PGA Tour win in 18 years , finished with a 69 for a total of 13-over 297 , he technically was leading the tournament . " If we get an earthquake here in the San Francisco area I might win this golf tournament , " he joked . <p> Golf being such an individual endeavor , it is hard to compare Woods ' performance with greatness in other sports , but it should n't be out of the question to superimpose this memorable 2000 Open win on other images of greatness  --  Secretariat in the Belmont , the Yankees ' dynasties , Jordan 's Bulls , the 49ers ' nearly perfect 55-10 win over Denver in the Super @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 97 was impressive , but Augusta National is no Pebble Beach in a USGA corset , and Woods ' play the past four days left an indelible impression on his fellow players . <p> WOODS ' RECORD RUN <p> . <p> Major Championship Records <p>  --  Margin of victory : <p> 15 strokes  --  breaks record of 13 strokes set by Old Tom Morris ( 1862 British Open ) <p>  --  Largest 54-hole lead : <p> 10 strokes  --  ties record of 10 strokes set by Henry Cotton ( 1934 British Open ) <p> . <p> U.S. Open Records <p>  --  Margin of victory : <p> 15 strokes  --  breaks record of 11 strokes set by Willie Smith ( 1899 ) <p>  --  Most strokes under par : <p> 12  --  breaks record of 8 held by Lee Janzen ( 1993 ) , Hale Irwin ( 1990 ) , Jack Nicklaus ( 1980 ) and Ben Hogan ( 1948 ) <p>  --  54-hole lead <p> 10 strokes  --  breaks record of 7 set by James Barnes ( 1921 )  --  36-hole lead <p> 6 strokes  --  breaks record of 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1960 ) <p>  --  Lowest total score : <p> 272  --  ties Nicklaus and Janzen <p>  --  Lowest 36-hole score : <p> 134  --  ties Nicklaus , Janzen and T.C.
