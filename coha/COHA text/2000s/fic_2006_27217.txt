Fawn came to the well-house a little before noon . More than a farmstead , less than an inn , it sat close to the straight road she 'd been trudging down for two days . The farmyard lay open to travelers , bounded by a semicircle of old log outbuildings , with the promised covered well in the middle . To resolve all doubt , somebody had nailed a sign picturing the well itself to one of the support posts , and below the painting a long list of goods the farm might sell , with the prices . Each painstakingly printed line had a little picture below it , and colored circles of coins lined up in rows beyond , for those who could not read the words and numbers themselves . Fawn could , and keep accounts as well , skills her mother had taught her along with a hundred other household tasks . She frowned at the unbidden thought : So if I 'm so clever , what am I doing in this fix ? She set her teeth and felt in her skirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she might certainly buy some bread . Bread would be bland . The dried mutton from her pack that she 'd tried to eat this morning had made her sick , again , but she needed something to fight the horrible fatigue that slowed her steps to a plod , or she 'd never make it toGlassforge . She glanced around the unpeopled yard and at the iron bell hung from the post with a pull cord dangling invitingly , then lifted her eyes to the rolling fields beyond the buildings . On a distant sunlit slope , a dozen or so people were haying . Uncertainly , she went around to the farmhouse 's kitchen door and knocked . A striped cat perching on the step eyed her without getting up . The cat 's plump calm reassured Fawn , together with the good repair of the house 's faded shingles and fieldstone foundation , so that when a comfortably middle-aged farmwife opened the door , Fawn 's heart was hardly pounding at all . " Yes , child ? " said the woman . I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back ; given the crinkles at the corners of the woman 's friendly eyes , maybe Fawn 's basket of years would still seem scant to her . " You sell bread ? " The farmwife 's glance around took in her aloneness . " Aye ; step in . " A broad hearth at one end of the room heated it beyond summer , and was crowded with pots hanging from iron hooks . Delectable smells of ham and beans , corn and bread and cooking fruit mingled in the moist air , noon meal in the making for the gang of hay cutters . The farmwife folded back a cloth from a lumpy row on a side table , fresh loaves from a workday that had doubtless started before dawn . Despite her nausea Fawn 's mouth watered , and she picked out a loaf that the woman told her was rolled inside with crystal honey and hickory nuts . Fawn fished out a coin , wrapped the loaf in her kerchief , and took it back outside . The woman walked along with her . " The water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it yourself , " the woman told her , as Fawn tore off a corner of the loaf and nibbled . " Ladle 's on the hook . Which way were you heading , child ? " " To Glassforge . " " By yourself ? " The woman frowned . " Do you have people there ? " " Yes , " Fawn lied . " Shame on them , then . Word is there 's a pack of robbers on the road near Glassforge . They should n't have sent you out by yourself . " " South or north of town ? " asked Fawn in worry . " A ways south , I heard , but there 's no saying they 'll stay put . " " I 'm only going as far south as Glassforge . " Fawn set the bread on the bench beside her pack , freed the latch for the crank , and let the bucket fall till a splash echoed back up the well 's cool stone sides , then began turning . Robbers did not sound good . Still , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to go near them . When Fawn had started on this miserable journey six days ago , she had cadged rides from wagons at every chance as soon as she 'd walked far enough from home not to risk encountering someone who knew her . Which had been fine until that one fellow who 'd said stupid things that made her very uncomfortable and followed up with a grab and a grope . Fawn had managed to break away , and the man had not been willing to abandon his rig and restive team to chase her down , but she might have been less lucky . After that , she 'd hidden discreetly in the verge from the occasional passing carts until she was sure there was a woman or a family aboard . The few bites of bread were helping settle her stomach already . She hoisted the bucket onto the bench and took the wooden dipper the woman handed down to her . The water tasted of iron and old eggs , but was clear and cold . Better . She would rest a while on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would make better time . From the road to the north , hoofbeats and a jingle of harness sounded . No creak or rattle of wheels , but quite a lot of hooves . The farmwife glanced up , her eyes narrowing , and her hand rose to the cord on the bell clapper . " Child , " she said , " see those old apple trees at the side of the yard ? Why do n't you just go skin up one and stay quiet till we see what this is , eh ? " Fawn thought of several responses , but settled on , " Yes 'm . " She started across the yard , turned back and grabbed her loaf , then trotted to the small grove . The closest tree had a set of boards nailed to the side like a ladder , and she scrambled up quickly through branches thick with leaves and hard little green apples . Her dress was dyed dull blue , her jacket brown ; she would blend with the shadows here as . . . Continues ...    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
