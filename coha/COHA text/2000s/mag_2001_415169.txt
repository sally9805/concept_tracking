There 's a fascinating world of fur and claws underfoot . Here 's how to tell who 's down there . By T Edward Nickens // My wife and I labored up the brutally steep trail to Hidden Lake as a young couple hightailed it downhill , breathing every bit as hard as we were . " If you 're going to the top , " the young fellow gasped and pointed toward the mountain , " you 'd better be careful . They 're everywhere ! " Everywhere ? They ? I scanned the ridgeline for thunderstorms , ever a threat in Washington 's North Cascades National Park . Or perhaps " they " meant pollen-crazed killer bees in this time of sweet-smelling wildflowers . Not even close . " Wolverines ! " the hiker announced with a shudder . " We must have seen a dozen up there . And their holes are all over the place ! " This boy had read one too many Jack London stories . How else to explain his misidentification of tunnel  --  loving , pacifistic yellow-bellied marmots for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to snicker at his poor grasp of mammalogy , I certainly understood his confusion over zoological aperture ecology , aka what-critter-you  --  reckon-made-that-hole ? After all , holes in the ground are among the most common animal signs a backpacker is likely to see , yet most hikers pass them by with little consideration . " People are overwhelmed by all the big stuff in a landscape , " says Pinau Merlin , an Arizona-based naturalist and author of A Field Guide to Desert Holes . " When they do notice an animal hole , they have no way of knowing what made it or why . Holes are a big mystery . " They do n't have to be . Like animal tracking , identifying dens and burrows is a great way for backpackers to get to know the wild neighborhood . Besides , it 's good to know if that burrow next to the tent is an innocent mole hole or the abyss of a venomous spider . DOWN THE HATCH Animals burrow beneath the earth for one reason : security . " Whether they seek a retreat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susan Morse , founder of the Vermont-based tracking organization Keeping Track , " animals want to worm their way into a tight place out of the elements-one that 's small enough to prevent a bigger animal from getting in . " Burrows are often much smaller than you 'd expect . A marmot den , for instance , will be just big enough for that marmot , so a larger coyote ca n't run in after him . A 1,000-pound grizzly bear might excavate tons of dirt when it digs its winter den , but the entrance to the den will be just large enough to accommodate the bear . That 's why the classic cartoon image of a big bear snoring away the winter in a huge cave " is all Walt Disney , " Morse says . Many holes in the ground are n't necessarily long-term residences ; they are dug to provide temporary safety from pursuers and extreme weather . A red fox , says Morse , might dig 10 or 15 quick  --  escape security dens in an area of less than 100 acres , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other hand , are dug solely for reproduction . Coyotes , wolves , and foxes construct complex systems with multiple chambers and entrances for use only during the young  --  rearing season . ( Lone among the canids , kit foxes of and western regions use underground dens year-round . ) Frequently , says Merlin , these animals will excavate a number of intricate natal dens and move the pups to a different den to escape fleas and ticks , or if the den is discovered by humans or other predators . And it 's not just four-footed animals that go underground with the kids . Burrowing owls line old mammal burrows with cow chips , grass , and feathers for a nest chamber , and belted kingfishers excavate nesting tunnels as long as 15 feet in the banks of rivers and creeks . But those who spend serious time in their underground homes dig the most impressive catacombs . Prairie dogs and badgers build subterranean superhighways up to 10 feet wide at depths of up to 30 feet . Groundhogs and marmots fashion elaborate burrow systems accessed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dive into at a moment 's notice . If you 're hiking across alpine fields in the West or meadows and pastures in the East , watch for these often camouflaged openings , lest you step in one and wrench an ankle or knee . In the desert Southwest , says Merlin , pack rats and pocket gophers dig separate chambers for defecation , sleeping , and food storage . Staying underground does more than keep them cool ; it keeps them alive . " For a little animal like that , " Merlin explains , " the more you 're aboveground , the easier it is for somebody to get you . " Insect burrows often serve double duty , offering security plus the perfect trap for unsuspecting prey . The tiger beetle larva tunnels into the ground , then plugs the entrance with the seamless camouflage of its flat head . When a smaller insect blunders by , the tiger beetle larva snatches it with powerful jaws and drags it into the lair . The trap-door spider takes the ruse to an architectural height by capping a burrow with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and camouflaged with moss , leaves , and small sticks . Silken hinges on the rear edge allow the spider to crack open the door at night and pounce on nearby prey . ROLE KNOWLEDGE If you wonder what lurks within some curious crevice , use the size , shape , and structure to determine the possible residents ( see " Whose Hole ? " on page 40 ) . A den site littered with fur , bones , and partially eaten prey is likely where a fox , coyote , or wolf is raising young . Move along so you do n't disturb the babies . Otherwise , find a comfortable spot , preferably downwind of the hole , and wait for a little head to pop out , confirming your guess . Sit quietly , and keep these clues in mind : Fresh dirt piled by a hole indicates an active marmot or woodchuck house . Quick-escape holes are dug from the inside and do n't have the telltale mound . A snake slithering out of a hole is just a visitor-or more likely a snacker-not a resident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rodent burrows for food . Skunks often defecate near their holes . You 'd better step lightly , or move away , if you spy 3/8- to 3/4-inch piles ( similar in shape to dog scat ) that contain lots of insect parts . Why build when there 's a den in movein condition ? That 's what skunks , mink , and raccoons do . These animals often take over abandoned dens , while opossums and foxes have been known to move in with the original owner of a multichambered den . Bear in mind that you might not even see some holes . Many pocket mice of the Southwest plug their entrance holes with soil during the day to stave off moisture loss . Tarantulas read the same book : During the day , they weave a film of silk that covers their burrows . " On the ground , " declares Merlin , " everybody has a trick up their sleeve . " Or , of course , down their hole . RESOURCES The following books are available from **28;1468;TOOLONG : A Field Guide to Desert Holes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; $7.50 ) .

Sidebar Hole-Watching Tips Sidebar DO : Sidebar Use a mirror to reflect sunlight into the hole instead of putting your face near the hole to see inside it . The beam is far brighter than that of a flashlight . Look for shed hair or hair caught on sharp objects like rocks and tree roots around the hole opening to identify the occupant .
