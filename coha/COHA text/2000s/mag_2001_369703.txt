Genius , so much fiction tells us , is the flip side of madness . In this busy , woozy thriller , a psychotic park dweller known as the Caveman ( Samuel L. Jackson ) is afflicted with " brain typhoons " and visions of " moth-seraphs . " That gives him just the intuition needed to sleuth out a murder case involving a chic photographer ( Colm Feore ) of the Mapplethorpe stripe . The Caveman has lapses of logic , but fewer than you will find in George Dawes Green 's improbable script . Despite Jackson 's typically bravura turn , this Valentine massacre marks a step backward for the gifted director of Eve 's Bayou . <P>  --  By Richard Corliss
