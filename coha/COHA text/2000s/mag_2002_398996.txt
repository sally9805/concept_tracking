Maybe because I grew up in the wilds of frozen Wisconsin , where ivy is generally not hardy outdoors , one of my greatest December delights here in Massachusetts has become watching the season 's first snowflakes gently fall onto the bed of ivy outside my office window . The ivy 's deep-green leaves catch and hold the white flakes as they drop , and though a moderate covering of snow will bury the vines completely for a while , when the weather warms , the pointed leaves will patiently reemerge , trumpeting a message dear to every gardener 's heart : " Worry not ! Winter has n't conquered all ; as I am still green , spring will indeed return ! " This same cheerful resiliency has made ivy one of the most beloved , and talked about , plants in Western gardens ; the legends that surround ivy are legion . A mere sampling of ivy lore : Ivy was for centuries associated with wine . The wine-besotted followers of the Roman god Bacchus wore ivy during their winter rites , decking themselves and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garb , appropriately enough , changed to grape leaves . ) In fact , the relationship between ivy and wine was so familiar and long running that until the 1700s many a British pub advertised itself merely by means of a bush of ivy placed out front . Similarly , it was said that one could detect adulterated wine by &gt; drinking it from a cup made of ivy wood ( more on " ivy wood " shortly ) . Drinking from these ivy cups was also said to cure any number of illnesses , especially whooping cough . ( Imbibing a lot of wine may have played no small role in these supposed cures ! ) In fact , so various were the prescribed medicinal uses for the plant that , as garden historian Alice Coats wryly put it , the number of potential cures suggested " experiment rather than experience .... One can not avoid the suspicion that ivy was so much used simply because it was always in hand . " Conversely , in the 19th century , ivy became associated with death and decay , probably because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any kind of ruin . As Charles Dickens noted in Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club : " For the stateliest building a man can raise is the ivys food at last . " The myths of ivy extend even to its origins , both etymological and botanical . The word ivy derives from Old English ifig , itself possibly related to Old English iw , meaning " yew . " Ivy 's Latin name , hedera , may derive from the Celtic word for " cord " ; this makes some sense at least , given the Druids ' reverence for the plant and its inclusion in their religious rites . Botanically , and not a little confusingly , nearly all ivies found in cultivation today are " sports , " accidental modifications or mutations derived from Hedera helix , English , or common , ivy . The other one percent come from H. algeriensis ( Algerian ivy , often labeled H. canariensis ) , H. colchica ( Persian ivy ) , and H. hibernica , Atlantic ivy , whose cultivar H. hibernica ' Hibernica ' ( Irish ivy ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English ivy . And as Dr. Sabina Mueller Sulgrove , a botanist with the American Ivy Society and the international registrar of Hedera , points out , botanical labels are currently being reclassified , adding still further to the gardener 's confusion . Part of the ancients ' reverence for ivy may have had to do with its bizarre habit of undergoing a fascinating biological change when it gets the chance to fully mature-hence the allusion earlier to " ivy wood . " Gardeners in milder climes are more than familiar with the fully mature ivys habit ( some &gt; may say pernicious penchant ) of ascending 20 , 30 , often 40 feet into the tops of trees , where a strange thing happens : When the vines can climb no farther , they undergo a change , becoming a quasi tree . In this adult , or arborescent , form , the leaves , which previously were five-lobed and pointed , become elliptical and lose their lobes ; the vines themselves thicken into upright stems , and the plant flowers ( with greenish-yellow blooms ) and produces berries that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , help spread new ivy plants ) . When cuttings are taken from these metamorphosed versions and planted , the plants that grow from the cuttings do n't revert to vines ; rather , they will form bushes or small trees , whence " ivy wood . " Ivy 's habit of climbing trees has caused a great storm of debate among gardeners for centuries , a dispute that echoes down to the present day : Is , or is not , ivy harmful to the things it climbs on ? The best answer ( as is often the case in gardening ) is : " It depends . " Ivy is categorically not a parasite and does not take nourishment from the plants it climbs . Sever the end of any vine : The leaves will begin to wither and die , as the tip can no longer draw sustenance from the main stem . However , in climates where ivy can fully mature , the massive weight of the thickened vines , especially if it is climbing up diseased or dying trees , may be enough to cause the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Opinions are likewise divided on ivy 's role in causing decay when climbing masonry . Some masons I know insist that the rootlets work their way into the mortar and cause the pointing to crumble . Others argue that the rootlets only adhere to the surface , and far from causing the mortar to decay , the shield from rain and shade from sunlight provided by the leaves actually helps to preserve the bricks and mortar from natural decay ; it 's the process of periodically ripping down and removing ivy from where it is not wanted that serves to loosen the pointing . You 'll have to decide for yourself Personally , I am happy to see it wherever it will grow outdoors . And grow ivy most certainly will , as long as you are south of Zone 5 and give it a modicum of water and shelter until it gets established . Outdoors , ivy is rarely troubled by pests ; indoors , red spider mite can sometimes be a problem , but is easily controlled . So this December , if you find yourself ivyless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth and deck your halls , and your grounds , with some ivy . If nothing else , the next time you 're tempted to raise a glass to Bacchus , you 'll never lack for a winter wreath . Sidebar <p>
