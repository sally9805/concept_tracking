Parental involvement plays a vital role in any child 's education . Educators are continually searching for ways to encourage parent participation in the educational process ( Dunman , 1998 ) . If parents understand what 's going on in the classroom and what 's expected of them and the students , they 'll he more able to help their child at home and will feel more comfortable with the teacher and the teaching methods employed ( Ludwig , 1999 ) . This process may be facilitated when parents have access to a class web site through the Internet . The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a physical education/health web site on parental knowledge of the program . A web site was developed for four physical education and two health classes . Ninety-four parents of the seventh grade students in these classes were selected . Parents completed a pre and post web site questionnaire . Results show the information they searched for in order of importance was related to : assessment , assignments , content , and program knowledge to aid parental assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of parents did not know what activities their children were doing in class . After having the opportunity to use the web site , the majority of parents said they always knew what activities their children were doing . The number of parents who knew their child 's progress in class increased after using the web site . However , the majority of parents did not know what assignments their child had in class before and after using the web site . Overall , the results showed that the majority of parents found the information on the web site useful . <p> During the past decade , the Internet has infiltrated our homes , businesses , schools , and many other areas of society . We now have access to amazing amounts of information , and are able to communicate with people around the world through electronic mail , newsgroups , and chat groups . <p> Public schools are seeking to use the Internet to improve the education of their students . Many school districts are tapping into this resource by creating their own web sites , which are connected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some schools operate independently of their school district and have their own web site . Teachers can create their own web site and link it to the school 's web site . <p> When contact time with students is limited , physical education teachers need to focus their attention in class on optimizing activity time . Hence , a web site can be a very useful way of disseminating information and further improving students ' physical education . Some physical educators are using the Internet to promote their physical education programs and as an aid to instruction ( Ellery , 1999 ) . Ellery suggests how a physical education web site can be used to advertise class schedules , enable revision of physical education coursework , make homework assignments , involve students in on-line discussion topics , post event information and profiles of the " Physically Active Student of the Week . " Crippen and Brooks ( 1999 ) suggest that such a web site should reflect the teacher 's personality and teaching style . <p> Parental involvement plays a vital role in any child 's education .

This process may be facilitated when parents have access to a class physical education/health web site through the Internet . Parents then know what their child is doing in the class . The Internet provides the opportunity to communicate with others around the world 24 hours a day ( Sanchez , 1998 ) , facilitating this informational opportunity for parents . <p> We need to be careful that we do n't assume that just because everyone is using the Internet , it will automatically meet our objectives in the most effective way . Thoreau noted society 's increasing reliance on technology and expressed concern lest we become the " tools of our tools " ( Haggerty , 1997 ) . <p> The effectiveness of a physical education/health web site on improving parental knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Ellery , 1999 ) believe it can be effective , but little empirical research has occurred . The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a physical education/health web site on parental knowledge of the program . Method Participants <p> Participants in this study were ninety-four parents of seventh-grade students in four physical education and two health classes , all taught by the same teacher . Treatment <p> A middle school physical education and health teacher developed a web site to help disseminate information to her classes , increase student involvement and enjoyment of the program , and inform parents of what was taking place in the program . By informing parents , the teacher hoped to increase parental involvement in their child 's education . Having made the decision that the web site development would be on-going , the first version of the web site was created . It consisted of a login screen linked to a screen where students selected their class . From the class page , students could select from the following : class schedule ( shows the schedule of activities for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results ( shows the results of class tournaments in the different activities ) * awards ( shows any awards students have received ) student profile ( has a short biographical sketch of a selected student highlighting the student 's physical education interests ) quote of the week ( a motivational quote ) performance cues ( lists the cues for the current activity unit ) * extra credit ( describes assignments students can complete to earn extra credit ) not on health web page Assessment Instruments <p> Pre-Web Site Questionnaire . Prior to the questions , parents were informed about the physical education and health web site to which their children would have access and which they would be able to view during the term . The questionnaire used Likert scale statements ( 1 = strongly disagree to 4 = strongly agree ) and open-ended questions to gather information concerning parents ' Internet and e-mail access ; their current knowledge of physical education or health class activities , assignments , and their child 's progress in the class ; and finally , their attitudes towards information on the web site that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Questionnaire . This questionnaire used the same methods to measure parental knowledge of activities , assignments , and their child 's progress in the physical education or health class ; parental attitudes towards information on the web site ; and frequency of parental visits to the web site . Data Collection and Analysis <p> Two seventh-grade physical education classes and one health class , all taught by the same teacher were randomly selected to use the web site in September 1999 . These classes used the site until the end of the term in January 2000 . The pre-web site questionnaire was mailed to parents of these students in August 1999 . A stamped , addressed envelope was enclosed so that parents could return the completed questionnaire . The teacher reflects back on her interaction with parents prior to web site usage . PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> At the end of the term in January 2000 the postweb site questionnaire was mailed to the same parents . A stamped , addressed envelope was enclosed so that parents could return the completed questionnaire . In order to increase the sample size in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration of pre- and post-web site questionnaires was followed with three more classes that contained different students and parents in the term that went from January 2000 until May 2000 . The design of the web site remained the same as with the previous three classes . However , the content was modified to be applicable to the activity units covered . <p> All open-ended responses were printed , and a content analysis was completed in which responses were sorted and coded with respect to specific topic by the researcher . Parental responses were then discussed with a peer debriefer to identify categories with similar content and common themes of greater generality , as recommended by Lincoln and Guba ( 1985 ) . Parental responses to each question often contained information that fell under several categories and/or themes . The Likert survey results were tabulated and percentages calculated . Results and Discussion <p> In response to the pre-web site questionnaire , 79% of parents said they had access to the Internet at home . E-mail access was slightly higher at 85% of parents surveyed . This high percentage is possibly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attended the school . <p> Prior to seeing the web site , over 79% of parents believed that it would be important for them to be able to see their student 's class schedule , assignments , study guides , skills tests ( physical education classes ) , projects , and grades ( Table 1 ) . In addition , when asked what else they would like to see on the web site , the following were frequent responses : personal teacher evaluation with suggestions and the opportunity to communicate with the teacher . The results of the content analysis of parental responses revealed that the most important information parents were looking for fell under four themes . In order of importance , these were : assessment , assignments , content for interest , and program knowledge to aid assistance ( Table 2 ) . <p> Two categories emerged under the assessment theme . First , parents felt it was really important to be able to see grades and other forms of assessment . This was the most frequently mentioned information parents were seeking ( 24% of all comments ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was available at the school 's web site , which parents could easily access with one mouse click . Second , student progress was another category that emerged from parental comments about assessment . One parent said , " I would like to look up everything so I know how she the student is doing . " Under this category , one parent who stated , " any comments by the teacher that can keep us informed of her progress , " obviously valued teacher input . <p> A second theme that emerged indicated that parents placed a high value on information about class assignments . Most of their comments were related to having an understanding of the nature of assignments . They also wanted to know the current status of how their child was doing on assignments . As one parent put it , " to keep currently involved in my student 's deadlines . " <p> Parental interest in the content of the unit was the third theme that surfaced . Parents wanted to know as much as possible about skills tests , study guides , and class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' comments was termed program knowledge to aid assistance . Some parents made comments such as " to help my child know what is expected of her , so I can help her , " indicating they wanted information from the web site so that they could help define expectations of the student . Others wanted to help improve student performance : <p> " I would like to be able to follow up and correct any concerns as immediately as possible and give praise where deserved . " <p> " I want to know what I can do to help my child succeed . " <p> " If my child is having a problem with something in the class , I 'd like to find the answer there on the web site e.g. understanding an assignment . " <p> After having the opportunity to see the web site during the term , parents ' responses to the post-web site questionnaire showed that the most important information they were searching for still broke out into the same four themes mentioned in the pre-web site questionnaire responses ( Table 2 ) . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) was deemed more important by parents after visiting the web site . The number of parents who thought grade information was the most important nearly doubled ( 43% ) compared to their pre-web site views ( 24% ) . <p> Content was not valued as highly after parents had access to the web site ( Table 2 ) . Likert data bears this out , as over 66% of parents believed that it was important for them to see their student 's class schedule , assignments , study guides , skills tests ( physical education classes ) , projects , and grades ( Table 1 ) . This is in contrast with their views prior to seeing the web site when over 79% thought these areas would be important to see . Parents also liked to see comments about their student from the teacher via e-mail , and current literature pertaining to the subject students were being taught in the form of hotlinks to other sites on the Internet . <p> Not all parents thought the web site was that useful . A few preferred more traditional methods of disseminating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sorry , I know web sites are innovative , but I prefer the " paper trail , " especially if my child is having a hard time . " <p> " We have more than one student , but one computer . It 's better to have paper course descriptions and check homework that way . " <p> Descriptive statistics of data from the pre-web site questionnaire revealed that only 42% of responding parents knew what activities their children were doing in physical education classes , and 46% knew the activities in health classes . After using the web site , 61% of the parents knew the physical education activities and 57% knew the health activities . <p> Knowledge of physical education assignments actually decreased after parents had access to the web site , dropping from 36% of parents who knew the assignments to 34% . Health assignment knowledge was also low , however , parental knowledge did improve from 36% to 41% . So the majority of parents did n't know their students ' assignments in any of the classes before or after using the web site . <p> Prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 53% ) knew how well their child was doing in physical education and health classes . After having access to the web site , parental knowledge of their child 's progress in physical education improved to 63% , and in health classes to 62% . <p> The number of times parents accessed the web site ranged from twice a week to never ( Table 3 ) . The majority of parents ( 56% ) visited the site at least once . Visits may have been affected during the first phase of web site usage from August 1999 to January 2000 , when the site was down for a period of time . During this time parents may have lost interest . Conclusions <p> The findings of this study have ramifications for other teachers who are considering the development of their own web sites . First , for other teachers who may be considering the development of their own web sites , time could be a factor . In reflecting back on this study the teacher states , PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> The majority of parents ' responses were favorable regarding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providing them with useful knowledge about the content of the class and expectations of the student . However , parents did not visit the site very often . This may be due to lack of time and/or interest . To help generate parental interest , teachers may want to make web sites more interactive rather than just informative . <p> How could this be accomplished ? Parents in this study expressed a desire to use the web site to communicate via e-mail with the teacher to receive suggestions regarding their students ' progress . This communication occurred in a random manner in this study . Teachers may want to initiate a more structured pattern of communication in order to generate more parental interest . Another way to increase interest could be to have a family assignment related to the unit . For example , a family fitness assignment could be made in which both students and parents access the web site to find and/or report data . <p> Finally , when teachers are designing a web site , they should make sure the site is easy to navigate , has an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many large graphics take too long to load ) , and is not too text-intensive .
