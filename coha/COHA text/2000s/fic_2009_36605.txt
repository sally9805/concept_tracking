The hot air pressed against my face as I entered the glass factory . The heat and the smell of burning coal surrounded me in a comforting embrace . I paused to breathe in the thick air . The roar of the kilns sounded as sweet as my mother 's voice . <p> " Opal ! " Aydan yelled above the noise . " Are you going to stand there all day ? We have work to do . " He gestured with a thin gnarled hand . <p> I hurried to join him . Working in the heat had turned his gray hair into a frizzy mop . Dirt streaked his hands . He grimaced in pain when he sat at his workbench , rubbing his lower back with a fist . <p> " You 've been shoveling coal again , " I admonished . He tried to look innocent , but before he could lie , I asked , " What happened to your apprentice ? " <p> " Ran off once he figured out how hard it is to turn fire into ice . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . " <p> " You 're late . " <p> " Sorry , I had a test . " I sighed . Another frustrating , fruitless endeavor . Not only had I failed to light the fire , but I knocked over the candles , spilling hot wax all over my classmate Pazia 's clothes and burning her skin . Her expensive silk tunic was ruined . She sneered in disdain when I offered to replace her shirt . Nothing new . Pazia 's hostility spanned my entire four years at the Keep . Why would I expect my last year to be any different ? <p> After starting my fifth year of lessons at the Magician 's Keep , I had hoped to be able to do more with my magic . Pazia 's abilities had grown so much since we sat next to each other during our very first session that the Master Magicians considered allowing her to take the Master-level test . <p> I 'd learned about Sitia 's history , politics , how to fight and about the uses for magic , but my ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the nagging feeling of being limited to one magical skill churned in my chest . And it did n't help my confidence when I overheard my fellow students calling me the One-Trick Wonder . <p> " Jealousy , " Aydan had said when I told him about my nickname . " You saved Sitia . " <p> I thought of the day-over four years ago-when I helped Liaison Yelena capture those evil souls . She had done all the work , I was merely a conduit . I tried to downplay my involvement , but Aydan remained stubborn . <p> " You 're a hero and those children ca n't stand it . " <p> Remembering his words made me smile . Calling fifteen to twenty-year-olds children was typical for Aydan , a proud curmudgeon . <p> He tapped my arm with a blowpipe . " Stop daydreaming and gather me a slug . " <p> I grabbed the hollow rod and opened the oven . Intense light burst from the furnace as if a piece of the sun was trapped inside . I spun the end of the rod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , removing a taffylike ball before my eyebrows and eyelashes could be singed off again . <p> The cherry-red slug on the end of the iron pulsed as if alive . Aydan blew through the pipe then covered the hole . A small bubble appeared in the molten glass . Resting the pipe on the metal arms of his gaffer 's bench , Aydan rolled the pipe back and forth , shaping the glass . <p> I helped him as he created an intricate vase with a twist at the bottom so the piece actually rested on its side yet could still hold water . In his hands , turning glass into art appeared to be an easy task . I loved the unique properties of molten glass which could be molded into such wonderful objects . We worked for hours , but the time flew . <p> When he finished his artwork , Aydan stood on creaky legs and said the words that were the reason I came to help him after my Keep classes . " Your turn . " <p> He exchanged places with me and grabbed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made sure all the metal tools lying on the bench were in their proper places . All I needed was my annoying younger brother telling me to hurry , and my patient older sister helping me to complete the feeling of being in my family 's glass factory . <p> Sitting at the bench was home-familiar and comfortable . Here and here alone , I was in control . The possibilities endless and no one could tell me otherwise . <p> All thoughts fled when Aydan placed the pipe in front of me . Glass cooled quickly and I had no time to dwell on anything but shaping the molten ball . Using metal tweezers , I pulled and plucked . When the slug transformed into a recognizable image , I blew through the end of the pipe . The piece 's core glowed as if lit by an inner fire . <p> My one magical trick-the ability to insert a thread of magic inside the glass statue . Only magicians could see the captured light . <p> Aydan whistled in appreciation of the finished piece . Technically his ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since he did n't possess any other talent he had n't been invited to study at the Keep . I should n't have been invited , either . I could make my special glass animals at my home in Booruby . <p> " Damn , girl . " Aydan slapped me on the back . " That 's a dead-on copy of Master Jewelrose 's red-tailed hawk ! Did you make that for her ? " <p> " Yes . She needed another piece . " I never knew what I would create when I sat down at the gaffer 's bench , but my time spent helping Master Jewelrose care for her hawk must have influenced me . The core glowed bright red and called to me with a song of longing . Each of my creations had a distinctive voice that sounded inside me . No one else could hear its call . <p> " See ? That 's another talent you have . " He bustled about and placed the hawk into the annealing oven so it could cool slowly . " Magicians can now communicate over vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only those who have the power of mental communication . " Another skill I lacked , mind reading . For those who possessed the ability , they only needed to hold one of my animals and they could " talk " to each other through the magic trapped inside . I 'd admit to feeling a measure of pride over their usefulness , but I would never brag about it . Not like Pazia , who flaunted everything she did . <p> " Pah ! It 's still one of the most important discoveries of recent years . Stop being so modest . Here  --  " he handed me a shovel "  --  put more coal in the kiln , I do n't want the temperature to drop overnight . " <p> End of pep talk . I scooped up the special white coal and added it to the fire under the kiln . Since Aydan sold his glass pieces as art , he only needed one-a small shop compared to my family 's eight kilns . <p> When I finished , my garments clung to my sweaty skin and strands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust scratched my throat . <p> " Can you help me mix ? " Aydan asked before I could leave . <p> " Only if you promise to hire a new apprentice tomorrow . " <p> He grumbled and grouched , but agreed . We mixed sands from different parts of Sitia . A secret recipe developed generations ago . It would be combined with soda ash and lime before it could be melted into glass . <p> As I tried to trick Aydan into telling me where the pink-colored sand came from , a messenger from the Keep arrived . A first-year student , he wrinkled his nose at the heat . <p> " Opal Cowan ? " he asked . <p> I nodded and he huffed . " Finally ! I 've been searching the Citadel for you . You 're wanted back at the Keep . " <p> " Why ? " <p> " I do n't know . " <p> " Who wants me ? " <p> He glowed with glee as if he were my younger brother delivering news of my impending punishment from our parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to be in big trouble . No other reason for the Masters to send for me . As I rushed after the messenger-an ambitious fellow to be running errands for the Masters in his first year , and who 'd already decided I was n't worth talking to-I thought of the mishap this morning with Pazia . She had wanted to get me expelled from my first day . Perhaps she finally succeeded . <p> We hurried through the Citadel 's streets . Even after four years , the city 's construction still amazed me . All the buildings had been built with white marble slabs streaked with green veins . If I was alone , I would have trailed my hands over the walls as I walked , daydreaming of creating a city made of glass . <p> Instead , I ran past the buildings as the brilliant color dulled with the darkening sky . The Keep 's guards waved us through-another bad sign . We vaulted up the stairs two at a time to reach the administration building . Nestled in the northeast corner of the Citadel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boundaries . Inside , the buildings had been constructed from a variety of colored marble and hardwoods . <p> The administration 's peach-and-yellow blocks used to soothe me , but not today . The messenger abandoned me at the entrance to the Masters ' meeting room . Hot from my sprint , I wanted to remove my cloak , but it hid my sweat-stained shirt and work pants . I rubbed my face , trying to get the dirt off and pulled my long hair into a neat bun . <p> Before I knocked , another possible reason for my summons dawned . I had lingered too long at the glass factory and missed my evening riding lesson . In the last year of instruction at the Keep , the apprentice class learned about horse care and riding to prepare us for when we graduated to magician status . As magicians we would be required to travel around the lands of the eleven clans of Sitia to render aid where needed . <p> Perhaps the Stable Master had reported my absence to the Masters . The image of facing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shake my bones . I turned away from the door , seeking escape . It opened . <p> " Do not hover about , child . You 're not in trouble , " First Magician Bain Bloodgood said . He gestured for me to follow him into the room . <p> With curly gray hair sticking out at odd intervals and a long blue robe , the old man 's appearance did n't match his status as the most powerful magician in Sitia . In fact , Third Magician Irys Jewelrose 's stern demeanor hinted at more power than Master Bloodgood 's wrinkled face . And if someone passed Second Magician Zitora Cowan in the street , that person would not even think the young woman possessed enough talent to endure the Master-level test . <p> Sitting around an oval table , the three Masters stared at me . I quashed the desire to hide . After all , Master Blood-good had said I was n't in trouble . <p> " Sit down , child , " First Magician said . <p> I perched on the edge of my seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We were both members of the Cowan clan , and she always made time from her busy schedule to talk to me . And , at twenty-five years old , she was only six years older than me . <p> I glanced around the room . Maps of Sitia and Ixia decorated the walls , and an oversize geographical map with its edges dropping off the sides covered the mahogany table . <p> " We have a mission for you , " Zitora said . She had twisted her honey-brown hair into a complex braid . The end of the braid reached her hips , but she fidgeted with it , twirling it around and through her fingers . <p> A mission for the Masters ! I leaned forward . <p> " The Stormdancers ' glass orbs have been shattering , " Master Jewelrose said . <p> " Oh . " I relaxed in my chair . Not a magical mission . <p> " Do you know how important those orbs are , child ? " Master Bloodgood asked . <p> I remembered my lessons about the Stormdance Clan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's energy into an orb . The benefits were twofold : tame the storm 's killing winds and rain , and provide an energy source for the clan 's other industries . " Very important . " <p> " And this is a critical time of the year . The cooling season is when the storms from the Jade Sea are most frequent and strong , " Zitora said . <p> " But does n't the clan have master glassmakers ? Surely they can fix the problem ? " <p> " The old glassmaker died , child . Those left behind were trained to make the orbs , but the glass is flawed . You need to help them find and correct the problem . " <p> Why me ? I was still learning . " You need to send a master glassmaker . My father  --  " <p> " Is in Booruby with all the other experts , but " Master Jewelrose paused . " The problem might not be with the glass . Perhaps the old glassmaker used magic when he crafted the orbs . Perhaps magic similar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a kiln . Events had become too hot too quick and the results could have cracks . I had worked with glass since I could remember , yet there was still so much to learn . " Whenwhen do we leave ? " <p> " Today , " Zitora said . <p> My alarm must have been obvious . <p> " Time is of the essence , child . " Master Bloodgood 's tone saddened . " When an orb shatters , it kills a Stormdancer . " <br> Continues ...
