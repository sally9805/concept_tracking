The first signs of French judge Marie-Reine Le Gougne 's heightened state of emotion came when she stepped into the elevator of the West Coast Salt Lake Hotel with the boos of 16,500 fans still ringing in her ears . She 'd already had an earful . According to an interview she gave later to the French sports daily L'Equipe , Le Gougne had been verbally attacked by skating officials she refused to name moments after leaving the judges ' box at the Salt Lake Ice Center . More criticism followed in the shuttle bus back to the hotel . Now two other judges , one from Great Britain and another from the U.S. , neither of whom had scored the pairs competition earlier that evening , entered the elevator with her . Teary-eyed and clearly distraught , Le Gougne averted their gazes . // The 40-year-old Le Gougne spent a sleepless night and awakened the following morning , Tuesday , Feb. 12 , to more criticism as she watched CNN . Upon arriving at the arena for the judges ' meeting that 's routinely held after every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her marks , she was greeted by a TV camera crew . Ten judges , including the substitute for the competition , were at the meeting , plus referee Ron Pfenning of the U.S. and assistant referee Alexander Lakernik of Russia . Pfenning duct-taped the edges of the door in the windowless room so that words said in the room could not be overheard . One by one the judges were asked to defend their marks . // Pfenning , a member of the International Skating Union ( ISU ) technical committee , which oversees judging , had disagreed with the final placements . On his card he 'd put the Canadian pair of David Pelletier and Jamie Sal ? first . The panel , of course , had named the Russian pair of Anton Sikharulidze and Elena Berezhnaya the winner by a 5-4 margin . China , France , Poland , Russia and Ukraine made up the majority . Canada , Germany , Japan and the U.S. were in the minority . The decision set off a firestorm of criticism . Spectators , television commentators , former skaters , journalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Canadian pair had been robbed . NBC commentators Scott Hamilton and Sandra Bezic , both former Olympians ( Bezic is Canadian ) , expressed outrage and embarrassment for their sport . // Pfenning knew things were not so simple . " It was close , " he told SI later . It is a tenet of judging that reasonable minds could disagree over the same performance , and it was his job to find out why the judges voted as they did . // Feelings ran high on both sides . " It was lengthy , emotional and tense , " Pfenning said . He recalls that Le Gougne was strangely quiet , as if something was building inside her . " Then , unsolicited , she burst out with a torrent , " Pfenning says . " She was very emotional , crying , and the words came rambling out in a cascade . ' You do n't understand . You must help us , you must do something . We 're under such enormous pressure . ' " Le Gougne then blurted out the name of Didier Gailhaguet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd told her which pair to put first . // Gailhaguet is a member of ISU president Ottavio Cinquanta 's inner sanctum , one of 11 members on the organization 's executive council . Le Gougne 's pointing the finger at Gailhaguet stunned everyone in the room into silence . A brief discussion about the pressures all of them felt ensued , but to Pfenning his duties were clear . After confirming with Lakernik that he had understood Le Gougne correctly , Pfenning wrote his report and delivered it to Cinquanta later that day . When word leaked out that the referee had concluded that the results of the pairs competition had been tainted by judging misconduct , it intensified a media frenzy that already had begun to consume the Olympics . // What followed was six days of rumor and innuendo , confessions and retractions  --  and a clinic on how not to hold an investigation during an Olympic Games . Le Gougne was suspended indefinitely by the ISU for " not informing the referee that she was pressured by the federation to put the Russians first , " according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was published on Monday , she continued to defend her vote . " I did n't want to speak out initially , but I feel I 've been so sullied that I have nothing left to lose , " Le Gougne said . " I judged according to my conscience and soul , and I felt the Russians were the best . " // Most skating experts agreed that the performances by the Russians and the Canadians had been similar in terms of jumps , spins and throws . The Russians had skated faster and had had more difficult choreography , but they 'd appeared tense throughout their program and made one obvious mistake when Sikharulidze stumbled on a side-by-side double Axel . The Canadians ' lifts had been harder , Pelletier and Sal ? had looked relaxed , and they had skated flawlessly . Some judges might have been bothered by the fact that their program was three years old , but that should have been more than outweighed by the emotional power they brought to their performance . It was magic , and magic counts in the tie-breaking presentation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions in past figure skating competitions that have quietly died after a few days . What set this one off  --  SKATEGATE ! the headlines blared  --  was Le Gougne 's startling confession in the review meeting that she 'd been asked by the head of the French federation , before the competition , to cheat . // It was n't the first time a smoking gun has been found in a panel of judges . At Nagano in 1998 , a Canadian judge , Jean Senft , believing a deal had been struck between the French and several Eastern bloc judges that would prevent the Canadian ice dancing team of Victor Kraatz and Shae-Lynn Bourne from winning a medal ( they would finish fourth ) , taped a phone conversation with Ukrainian judge Yuri Balkov , during which Balkov asked Senft to vote for the Ukrainian skaters in exchange for his support of Kraatz and Bourne . After Senft submitted the evidence to the ISU , Balkov was suspended for a year . Remarkably , though , with his suspension behind him , Balkov was back on the dance panel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pool of judges whose countries ' skaters placed in the top 16 at the most recent worlds . // At the 1999 world championships in Helsinki two judges , a Ukrainian and a Russian , were suspended after they were caught by television cameras communicating by surreptitious glances and foot signals before they entered their marks into the computer . As recently as December longtime IOC member Richard Pound of Canada , mindful that the ISU had done nothing to meaningfully change the way judges were selected in the wake of these scandals , called for ice dancing to be removed as an Olympic sport . Last week Pound weighed in again , calling the judging system " completely irredeemable and corrupt " and describing the ISU as " a separate little fiefdom that has now been exposed . " // As details of Le Gougne 's confession began to leak , speculation about vote-swapping followed . The French , it was theorized , must have agreed to exchange their vote in pairs for the Russian vote in ice dancing , in which the French team of Gwendal Peizerat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge on the dance panel was Alla Shekjovtseva , who 's married to the president of the Russian Skating Federation , Valentin Piseev . Gailhaguet and Piseev have the power to select which judges go to the Olympics from their respective countries . Shekjovtseva had placed the French dancers third in the compulsory dance she had judged at the most recent European championships ; if she placed them third at the Olympics , who knew which members of the panel-including judges from Azerbaijan , Bulgaria , Lithuania , Poland and Ukraine  --  might follow her lead ? France did n't have a judge on the Olympic dance panel . // The Canadian Olympic Association ( COA ) suddenly had two teams to look out for . Of course there was Pelletier-Sal ? , who overnight had become the most sympathetic and recognizable duo in skating , and then there was Kraatz-Bourne , the dance tandem whose placement in Salt Lake City may have already been determined . Michael Chambers , president of the COA , sent a letter to Cinquanta demanding an immediate independent investigation . Cinquanta , who 's from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acrimonious press conference on Wednesday morning , Feb. 13 , he poured gasoline on the fire with a slew of evasive and contradictory answers . Eventually he said he was embarrassed by the incident , but he added , " I do not think it was a scandal "  --  a stunning admission from a man who was supposedly conducting an investigation . Cinquanta further insisted that he saw no reason to convene the ISU council earlier than the following Monday to address the matter . That was five days away , the day of the dance final . // New IOC president Jacques Rogge , a Belgian , felt otherwise , and on Wednesday afternoon he told Cinquanta to resolve the dispute as expeditiously as possible . That night Gailhaguet acknowledged in a phone interview with a French reporter from the Associated Press that " some people close to the judge have acted badly and put someone who is honest and upright , but emotionally fragile , under pressure . " // On Valentine 's Day , after the AP story came out , all hell broke loose . Gailhaguet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , claiming he 'd been misunderstood and misled . An AP spokesperson responded that there 'd been no misunderstanding , that the conversation had taken place entirely in French and then had been meticulously translated . At a 9 p.m. press conference Gailhaguet said that no one in the French federation had acted improperly and that " contrary to the accusations , there was no collusion with the East European nations . " // " There can be human error , " Gailhaguet added , " but not five humans and five errors . We must accept the result for democracy and the credibility of our sport . " // Meanwhile , Rogge and Cinquanta engaged in an animated conversation while sitting together at the men 's figure skating final that night . Earlier on Thursday an IOC official had assured a member of the COA that the controversy would be resolved by the next day . " It 's our Games , too , " IOC director general Fran ? ois Carrard said , his frustration over the way the controversy was overshadowing other events etched in his voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexei Yagudin was awarded his figure skating gold medal , Cinquanta convened a meeting of the ISU council . With all 11 members in attendance , the council voted to suspend Le Gougne indefinitely for failing to immediately report to the referee that she 'd been pressured to vote a certain way . Then , in an extraordinary move that was counter to its procedures , the group recommended to the IOC executive board that a gold medal be awarded to the Canadian pair . The IOC board adopted the recommendation : seven votes in favor , one against ( China ) and one abstention ( Russia ) . // Last Friday morning a chastened Cinquanta and a stern-faced Rogge delivered this news at another standing-room-only press conference . Three times in previous Olympics a second medal had been awarded , but this was the first instance for a judging impropriety . Asked if any penalties would be assessed beyond the suspension of Le Gougne , Cinquanta gave assurances that the investigation into allegations of vote-swapping would continue . " This is step 1 , " said Carrard , who implied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . " The ISU will first complete its own investigation , and we will receive the report in due time . " // " For a very long time we have known about the recurring sickness that has sapped skating , " said Henri S ? randour , head of the French National Olympic Committee . " Let 's hope action to remedy it will follow . " // France and Russia may seem like strange bedfellows , but it comes down to money and influence . Three years ago the French figure skating federation was in such financial difficulty that it could n't pay its bills , and the management of its finances had to be overseen by the French government . Every year the skating federation must negotiate a contract with the Ministry of Sport . " The money given to figure skating by the state is based on many things , " says J ? r ? me Rouillaux , France 's deputy chief of mission in Salt Lake City . " Popularity and results are two factors . But the Olympic Games is the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judges from countries of the former Soviet Union remains considerable . Many of the international judges from the former Soviet republics live in Moscow or St. Petersburg and were trained in Russia . Many of their skaters are Russians who have dual citizenship and are coached by Russian coaches . Simply put , Russia is a good ally for France  --  or any other figure skating country  --  to keep . // " All federations are involved in vote swapping , not only the Russians , " says Alexander Zhulin , a 1994 silver medalist in ice dancing for Russia . He coaches the top U.S. dance team of Peter Tchernyshev and Naomi Lang , who finished 11th on Monday night . " Some judges are strong . Some are weak and just follow what their federation tells them . It 's corruption . It 's dirty . " // The U.S. is n't above suspicion , either . Franklin Nelson , a former president of the U.S. Figure Skating Association , was approached by a top American coach in the 1970s while he was an international judge . The coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach a judge to see if he could arrange a vote swap . Nelson respectfully declined . // Such shenanigans may soon disappear if Cinquanta 's proposal to revolutionize the way figure skating is judged is enacted when the full ISU Congress meets in June . In a week of hasty meetings and press conferences , Cinquanta floated his idea before the ISU executive board on Monday , and it was unanimously endorsed . The plan , which Cinquanta said he has been working on for some time , calls for the elimination of the 0 to 6.0 scale of marks , which , ultimately , asks each judge to place skaters in order from first to last . Instead , a panel of 14 would score the skater 's individual elements ( jumps , spins , footwork , etc. ) according to a preassigned degree of difficulty , in much the same way diving competitions are scored . The elements would then be totaled , and a computer would randomly select seven of the marks to be used to tabulate each skater 's score . Highest score  --  not most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect , but if adopted  --  and the atmosphere is right for such a revolutionary change  --  Cinquanta 's plan will surely be an improvement over the current judging system . The backroom deal may soon be a thing of the past . // On Monday night , by the way , the French ice dancers narrowly won the gold medal , by a 5-4 count . The decision was generally hailed as the correct one . Peizerat and Anissina , it appeared , did n't need extra help after all . The Russian judge , Shekjovtseva , placed the French couple second , behind the silver-medal-winning Russian team of Ilia Averbukh and Irina Lobacheva . It just must have seemed like the right thing to do .
