It had been blowing 45 knots out of the northeast for three days . The motoryachts were rocking , and the sportfishermen were dipping their riggers . Then finally the wind shifted around to the east and decreased to a piddling 25 knots . " We can go down to the south end of Biscayne Bay , " Richie Powers said , " but not outside . " This , from a man who has spent most of his life bashing through seas in snarling powerboats , winning offshore racing championships and acting as throttleman for the likes of macho actors Don Johnson and Kurt Russell . The problem was n't that Powers was intimidated by the 12-foot seas in the Gulf Stream . Rather , the boat  --  a sleek and slippery Baia 54  --  was owned by a man who was apprehensive at the idea of a couple of wild-eyed dudes going Yeeeehaaa ! with his toy . The pennants were still snapping out warnings as we  --  including Pepino Rupil from the Baia shipyard near Naples , Italy  --  left the confines of the Sealine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the glass-sheathed towers of downtown Miami kicked back the sun . I was struck by the thought that this boat and this town are just right for each other . This city is an international playground for the rich and the famous ; it should be seen from the deck of a glamorous boat . " Hang on , " Powers said . Rupil and I grabbed a rail as he advanced the throttles . The Baia lifted quickly onto plane , and we left Miami in a tall plume of spray as the Arneson drives kicked up their signature roostertail . " A 53 mile per hour boat , " Powers said . " You could use it on a poker run , or go to Bimini in just an hour . " Rupil chimed in : " From Naples to Genoa is 320 miles , " he said above the roar of the big MAN diesels . " It 's seven and a half hours in this boat . Run fast for six hours , slow for half an hour . Run fast again . " When it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dashboard is clean and the helm seat a double-wide design . A companion seat is to port . Abaft that is a huge U-shaped settee with a sunpad beyond . The sunpad sits atop the engine room hatch and lifts easily to reveal the machinery . The sunroof pops off entirely if you like . In South Florida you may want to keep it on , because there is n't much wind in the endless no-wake zone of the Intracoastal Waterway . Global Yachts ( the boat 's importer ) offers " tropical air conditioning , " which includes vents on the bridge . Later in the day , I went below and was bedazzled by the sheer elegance of the cherry woodwork , especially in the salon with its curvaceous bulkheads . The galley also is nice , and plenty big enough to cook up a passel of pasta . Oh , pardon me ; you 're probably like everybody else and on the South Beach Diet . There is a two-burner Ceran electric stove , a deep sink and a fridge/freezer . A Sharp microwave and trash compactor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward has a pedestal double berth and cedar hanging lockers . The private head compartment with circular shower stall is a bit tight , though . There are two other cabins aboard , both abaft the salon . The cabin to port has private access to the day head . Did I say this boat and Miami were meant for each other ? Think swellegant condo , swaying palms and champagne . " It 's all about speed and comfort , " Powers said . " And looks , too .
