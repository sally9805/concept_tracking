There are none so blind as those who would not see the real Abdurahman Alamoudi . <p> IF A HOLLYWOOD STUDIO WERE TO RELEASE A FILM resembling Abdurahman Alamoudi 's life , it would likely be picketed as yet another example of the prejudice Muslims endure in post-9/11 America . Prominent Washington socialite and founder of the American Muslim Council ( AMC ) turned terrorist financier ? Surely the story of such a double life must be relegated to the pages of pulp fiction spy novels , scarcely memorable and shipped to your local book store by the dozen . Yet , in the story told by a recent affidavit filed by U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agent Brett Gentrup , Alamoudi resembles the very sort of stereotype he has denounced as unrealistic for years . <p> On August 13 , 2003 , Alamoudi answered the phone in his London hotel room , and was greeted by the voice of a man speaking Arabic with a Libyan accent . He said he had something for Alamoudi . Could he come up ? When the man arrived in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left . Arranged neatly inside was $340,000 , conveniently strapped in bundles of sequentially numbered $100 bills . Alamoudi transferred the money to his own luggage , left the Samsonite for the maid to deal with , and headed off to board a plane at Heathrow Airport . Destination : Damascus , Syria . The plan was foiled during a routine customs search . <p> In subsequent interviews with British officials from the National Terrorist Financial Investigations Unit , Alamoudi explained that fundraising for his charitable group , the American Muslim Foundation , an offshoot of the American Muslim Council , was " a constant struggle . " The much-maligned Libyan government was only too happy to help , it seems . In 1997 , one year after he became a naturalized citizen , Alamoudi approached the Libyan Ambassador to the United Nations , Abuzed O. Dora . Dora suggested that if Alamoudi could secure the release of any of Libya 's frozen assets ( using his high-level contacts in the Clinton administration and Congress , presumably ) , Libya would give Alamoudi an " unspecified share " of the cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie , Scotland . So no deal . Dora then suggested Alamoudi request the money from the World Islamic Call Society ( WICS ) , a jihad fund set up by Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi . The WICS , according to the U.S. State Department , " is the outlet for state approved religion , as well as a tool for exporting the revolution abroad . " The U.S. government believes Alamoudi became a member of the WICS in 2000 . <p> Alamoudi told British officials that his plan had been to deposit the large sum in banks in Saudi Arabia and funnel it back into banks in America in smaller amounts . There is a name for such a transaction : money-laundering . It happens to be a crime , as Alamoudi found out when he returned home to the United States on September 28 and was promptly hauled off to jail . Among the other alleged crimes in the 18-count indictment that shortly followed : prohibited financial transactions with the Libyan government , misuse of a passport , procuring naturalization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts . If Alamoudi thinks the Brits and U.S. Customs have been rough on him , wait until the IRS smells that blood in the water . <p> British agents also found two U.S. passports and one Yemeni passport on Alamoudi . This information was passed along to their American counterparts , and when he arrived at Dulles International Airport on September 28 he told customs officials he had only been to England and Saudi Arabia . In fact , his concealed U.S. passport showed that he had also visited Lebanon , Syria , Yemen , Egypt , and Libya . A comparison of records and passports showed that this was not the first time Alamoudi had not been forthcoming about his travels . <p> Worse , Libyan jihadists were not Alamoudi 's only friends . A government document filed in support of Alamoudi 's detention alleged that through his control of the Success Foundation , the Happy Hearts Trust , and Taibah International Aid Association , Alamoudi provided " material financial support " to al Qaeda fronts , including the designated terrorist organization Global Relief Foundation and the Foundation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell responsible for the Millennium Bombing plot . " <p> In a letter to Dora found in Alamoudi 's offices in Falls Church , Virginia , Alamoudi refers to a planned meeting with Iranian President , Mohamed Khatemi , in New York , and asks Dora for help arranging meetings with leaders of Pakistan , Sudan , and Iraq . The Boston Herald reports : " Alamoudi 's Palm Pilot , seized in August by British police ... contained the names of seven men designated by the U.S. government as global terrorists . " Authorities are trying to find out if an unsigned , " Hamas document " seized in Alamoudi 's office was authored by him . The document , written in Arabic , is a to-do list of terror , including , " Executions of operations against the Israelis to delay the peace process , " and " Preparation of a budget for Hamas cells in various areas , " among assorted other tasks . <p> Michael J. Horowitz , director of Hudson Institute 's Project for Civil Justice Reform and Project for International Religious Liberty , calls Alamoudi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American soil . " <p> FOR YEARS ALAMOUDI , deflected even the mildest criticism of his association with and apologetics for terrorists with cries of " anti-Muslim bigotry . " To question Alamoudi 's bold statements was to instantly be labeled a jingoistic crusader intent on persecuting the American Muslim community . <p> The contradictions inherent within Alamoudi 's professed aims of unity and peace and his regular cries of bloody revenge were not enough to raise a red flag in the eyes of the politically correct Washington establishment . Apparently they were more keen on sensitivity than reality , or perhaps that up-for-grabs Muslim voting bloc was too tantalizing a prize . Whatever it was , Alamoudi prospered . <p> His AMC was labeled by an FBI spokesperson as the most mainstream Muslim group in the United States . Clinton appointed him as a roving " Goodwill Ambassador " to the United Nations in 1997 . He helped Republican stalwart Grover Norquist get the Islamic Institute off the ground with sizable contributions . Then-First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton had him draw up the guest list for the first official White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gore and Bill Clinton at the White House and then-presidential candidate George W. Bush in Austin . The head of the FBI , Robert Mueller , was the keynote speaker at a June 2002 AMC convention . <p> Alamoudi was routinely quoted as an expert on Islam in America in the nation 's most prominent newspapers , from USA Today and the New York Times to the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times . He also appeared many times on CNN , not only on political shows such as Crossfire , but also on midday fluff talk shows where people called in to ask him questions about everyday Muslim life in America . He gave money , both his own and the AMC 's , to a diverse roster of political candidates , from conservative Senator John Sununu of New Hampshire to fringe leftists Rep. Cynthia McKinney of Georgia and now presidential-candidate Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich . He sent money to both Hillary Clinton 's Senate campaign and George W. Bush 's presidential bid . <p> In the end , most of the contributions were returned and it 's certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an election year  --  just ask any pharmaceutical executive . But , as it turns out , the " goodwill ambassador " had a dark side , brashly held out all along for everyone to see . <p> Consider this public statement Alamoudi made at a meeting of the Islamic Association of Palestine , a Hamas front organization , on December 29 , 1996 : <p> " I think if we are outside this country , we can say , oh , Allah , destroy America . But once we are here , our mission in this country is to change it . There is no way for Muslims to be violent in America , no way . We have other means to do it . You can be violent anywhere else but in America . " <p> In 1991 , a mere year after forming the American Muslim Council , Alamoudi attended the largest gathering of Islamic militants ever held in the United States , sponsored by the United Association for Studies and Research , widely considered to be the voice of Hamas in America . Among the conference 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Palestine , an Islamic Jihad front , as well as a slew of other radical leaders , foreign and domestic . <p> Alamoudi called the deportation of U.S. based Hamas leader Musa Abu Marzouk for his involvement in several terror attacks in Israel , an " insult to the Muslim community . " " I know the man , he is a moderate man on many issues , " Alamoudi told the Washington Post . " If you see him , he is like a child . He is the most gracious person , soft-spoken . He is for dialogue . " Dialogue , perhaps , such as this gem from an interview with Marzouk in Beirut 's Al-Ahd in 1994 : " First of all , martyrdom is the goal of every Muslim , and death represents the ideal wish of the Mujahad on the land of Palestine . " How gracious . How childlike . How kind indeed . <p> Alamoudi could be cruel himself . In a wiretapped conversation made public in the recent criminal complaint , he praises a 1994 bombing in Buenos Aires . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Alamoudi tells an unidentified man , in Arabic . " I think that the attacks that are being executed by bin Laden and other Islamic groups are wrong , especially hitting the civilian targets . Many African Muslims have died and not a single American died . I prefer to hit a Zionist target in America or Europe .... I prefer honestly like what happened in Argentina . " <p> Alamoudi also gave an impassioned defense of the terrorists who plotted and carried out the 1993 World Trade Center bombing , which killed six people and left a crater five floors deep . " I believe the judge went out of his way to punish the defendants harshly and with a vengeance , and to a large extent , because they were Muslims . " <p> On October 28 , 2000 , Alamoudi boldly addressed a cheering crowd in Lafayette Park , near the White House : " I have been labeled by the media in New York to be a supporter of Hamas .... Anybody support Hamas here ? ( Cheers ) Hear that , Bill Clinton ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added that I am also a supporter of Hezballah .... I want you to send a message . It 's an occupation , stupid .... Hamas is fighting an occupation . It 's a legal fight . " <p> When these comments were reported in the Washington Post , political contributions were returned , and Alamoudi was forced to take a back seat in the AMC . By all accounts , however , he remained in control and kept a busy schedule . According to the SITE Institute , " In January 2001 , Alamoudi attended and was photographed in Beirut at a terrorist summit , alongside representatives of the terrorist groups Hamas , Palestinian Islamic Jihad , Hezballah , and al-Qaeda . " <p> Nevertheless , in the aftermath of September 11 , Alamoudi , a man who voiced constant support for terrorists , was invited to a prayer session with other Muslims and President Bush . Even at this late date , he managed to hold himself up as a moderate practitioner of Islam . <p> In light of his current predicament , some of Alamoudi 's other endeavors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his founding of the American Muslim Armed Forces and Veteran Affairs Council , one of only two organizations able to certify Muslim chaplains for service in the U.S. military . One of those chaplains , Army Capt . James Yee , now sits in a military jail on suspicion of treason . Military authorities found diagrams of the cells and facilities at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , along with lists of the detainees and their interrogators on Yee . <p> THOSE WHO CHOSE TO PLAY THE GAME with Alamoudi are left desperately trying to put a good face on an increasingly bad situation . For example , how did the AMC end up labeled as the most mainstream Muslim group in America ? Yes , the AMC issued a condemnation of the September 11 attacks . But , then , so did Yasser Arafat . If the crack research team at the FBI had looked at the AMC website in the aftermath of September 11 , however , this is what it would have found under the heading , The Law Says You Do n't Have to Talk to the FBI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against you , your family and/or your community . The FBI has a history of harassing and harming minority and immigrant communities . Some people are spending a long time in jail because they or their friends talked to the FBI .... FBI agents are trained to get you to make incomplete or contradictory statements  --  which later can be used against you in court . It is better to say nothing . " <p> In October 2000 Hillary Clinton announced she was returning Alamoudi 's contributions to her campaign . Hillary returned the money because of her " serious disagreements " with Alamoudi 's views , but defended her long record of involvement with him as part of the Clinton administration 's attempt to " promote a framework for peace , " by opening " lines of communication to many different groups and many different individuals . " Hence , the truth in Alamoudi 's claim of the American Muslim Council : " We are the ones who went to the White House and defended what is called Hamas . " <p> Can we really believe Hillary 's professions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House , could she really have forgotten Alamoudi protesting President Clinton 's decision to meet with the fatwa-burdened author , Salman Rushdie ? Alamoudi whined on CNN 's Crossfire : " If somebody was talking about the Holocaust and he was saying how horrible it was , people understand that , but you do n't understand when seven million American Muslims are insulted . " This was in 1993 , before he sent her money , before he drew up the Ramadan White House guest list . <p> GOP hero Grover Norquist has been similarly dismissive of the criticism . Norquist 's Islamic Institute , a free-market Muslim organization , was launched in part with $20,000 in checks from Alamoudi and the SAFA Trust . In a June 11 , 2003 article in the Wall Street Journal , Norquist scoffed at his critics : " Since I started working with Muslims , a handful of bigots have been trying to smear the president , Rove and me for working with them . " Alamoudi 's arrest has not tempered that sentiment . " Grover had no working relationship with Alamoudi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not do any consulting work for him , as has been widely reported . The idea that Grover had a close personal relationship with Alamoudi is completely false . The whole thing is part of a calculated smear campaign by fringe publications and lazy writers who have been trying for several years to halt Grover from forming a center-right coalition with Muslim Americans . " But is that the whole story ? <p> Insight magazine reporter Kenneth Timmerman , in his recent book Preachers of Hate , describes a meeting with Norquist , who was unhappy about his treatment in several Insight articles . Timmerman writes that Norquist accused him and the magazine of " bizarre anti-Muslim attacks . " Former Alamoudi associate and current president of the Islamic Institute Khaled Saffuri also tried to distance himself from Alamoudi , but Timmerman pointed out that in 1995 , while Saffuri was on staff at AMC , the group had invited one Yusuf al-Qaradawi to speak at a conference . That same year on Qatar state television , al-Qaradawi made the following plea for unity : " O God , destroy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggressor Americans . O God , destroy the fanatic pagans . O God , destroy the tyrannical crusaders . " <p> Timmerman writes : " When I raised the AMC invitations to al-Qaradawi , Norquist flew into a rage . Any attempt to link him to al-Qaradawi or the AMC was ' guilt by association . ' Saffuri had left the AMC ' years ago , ' he added . But by Saffuri 's own account , he went to work for Norquist 's Islamic Institute almost immediately after he left the AMC . " <p> Although Alamoudi was caught red-handed , papers throughout the Muslim world are calling his arrest part of a U.S. government " witch hunt " against its Muslim population . Dr. Ahmed Yousef , editor-in-chief of the Middle East Affairs Journal , wrote in the Palestinian Chronicle that if Alamoudi is a target , " then we are all targets . " <p> " The objective was to put Alamoudi in a permanent political freeze , " Yousef wrote . " If he spoke at public rallies or other occasions in protest of certain American foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> BUT IN AMERICA , WHERE IT COUNTS , Alamoudi is now very much the dying man even the friendliest patients in the ward avoid . As he sits in j ail , very few of his old friends are standing by him . Days after his arrest , one of Alamoudi 's old compatriots , Kamal Nawash , claimed he was Alamoudi 's lawyer and wrote on Islam Online : " Alamoudi has no links whatsoever to violence or terrorism . On the contrary , he supported the U.S. war on terrorism . " Days later , however , Nawash announced he was not representing Alamoudi . Nawash , a Republican candidate for the Virginia state senate ( he would lose in November ) , returned two campaign donation checks of $5,000 to Alamoudi and his wife , Shifa , according to the Washington Post . <p> Support for Alamoudi is predicated upon the belief that there is a difference between words and action . And indeed there is . But how could Washington establishment types have been duped by Alamoudi ? The man 's tenure in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cargo train rumbling down the tracks . Alamoudi spent years openly celebrating terrorism in speeches and writings . Is it too much to ask of politicians that they put two and two together ? Should it shock that someone who supported terrorism rhetorically would support it financially ? Does siding with Islamic fundamentalists and terrorist states for a decade not raise eyebrows , even among the admittedly slow-witted , self-serving politicos in our nation 's capital ? <p> In the end , Alamoudi will be tried in an American court . There will be no arguing Zionist conspiracy theories . He will have to answer for what he has done . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By Shawn Macomber <p> <p> Shawn Macomber is a reporter for The American Spectator . <p>
