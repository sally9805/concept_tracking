##, leave them whole . <p> A roux is the traditional way to thicken and enrich gravies , sauces and soups . It 's essential to making our Best Way Gravy see recipe . <p> Our roux is a cooked mixture of flour and butter . For the gravy , we use about 1/2 stick butter with 1/2 cup flour . <p> To make the roux , start by melting the butter in a heavy-bottom saucepan until it foams and bubbles . Add the flour all at once , whisking constantly until a grainy consistency has formed , about 3-4 minutes . <p> To thicken the gravy , cook it with the finished roux mixed in for at least 15 to 20 minutes . This will eliminate the starchy flour flavor and bring it to the desired , thickened consistency . <p> The key to a good stuffing is in the bread , but the effort lies in cutting the vegetables . Most stuffing recipes require chopped onions as a base ingredient , even if you 're using a boxed mix . If done properly , this can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the onion , trim the root end , then halve the onion from top to bottom . This will give each half a flat side to place on the board . <p> Leave the root end which will be tighter than the stem end intact to hold the onion together , peel off the skin , and make vertical cuts along the onion half , spacing them according to the desired thickness of the dice . Do n't cut all the way through to the root . <p> Next make horizontal cuts . With your knife parallel to the cutting board , slice the onion , spacing according to your desired dice size . <p> Finally , cut the onion cross-wise , releasing the diced onions in each layer as you cut toward the root end . When you 've reached the final piece , lay it flat on the cutting board and make cuts in both directions to finish the dice . <p> Chestnuts are one of the most versatile ingredients in the holiday meal . They can be tossed into a stuffing mix , pureed for a soup or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brussels sprouts on Page F5 . <p> However , if the fresh , glossy nuts are not roasted properly , they can wreak havoc on your fingers - or your stove . <p> The trick is to cut an " X " into the bottom , flat part of the chestnut before roasting in a hot oven . This will prevent them from bursting . As the nuts cook , the hard shells will curl back at the edges of the " X , " providing you with a starting point for peeling . Cooked long enough , the shell should slide right off . <p> One pound of whole , fresh chestnuts yields about 2 cups peeled and prepared . <p> Sure , you can shake it out of a can . But homemade cranberry sauce could n't be simpler to prepare , and it can be done well in advance of the holiday . <p> The fruit is a natural thickener , so 10 minutes in the pot and it 's ready to go . Check out the accompanying Chronicle classic recipe for Citrus-Cranberry Sauce , which blends the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Once the sauce has cooled , it can be stored in the fridge for 3 to 4 days . <p> The difference between light , fluffy mashed potatoes and a gummy mess is in the tools . For very smooth potatoes , put the cooked potatoes through a ricer , which forces out the lumps . For a more rustic dish , use a handheld masher . A standing mixer or food processor will over-activate the starch in the potatoes and cause the gumminess . <p> It 's also a good idea to warm up the cream or milk with the butter before adding it to the potatoes ; this helps to eliminate lumps and ensure a creamy texture . Taste as you go , adding salt , pepper , butter or liquid as needed . <p> Anything that you can do an advance of Thanksgiving Day is a good idea , and prepping your vegetables is a no-brainer . You do n't want to pre-cut them too far in advance , as that can affect the flavor , but vegetables like broccoli , Brussels sprouts and green beans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drop the vegetables in boiling water - salted is better - for a few minutes until they turn crisp-tender . Remove them and immediately plunge into ice water , which will stop the cooking . The vegetables will hold at this stage in the fridge for at least a day , until you 're ready to finish cooking and seasoning them . <p> Even the most experienced baker can have trouble rolling out a pie crust and getting it into the pan . It 's a technique that requires practice . <p> To roll out our " Best Way " pie dough - what we use for pumpkin pie - start with the flattened round of dough that has been chilled in the refrigerator . <p> Have a pile of flour on hand for dusting , so that nothing sticks . Starting in the center of the dough , make short strokes toward the edges in different directions , turning the dough often as it becomes thinner to maintain a circular shape . Sprinkle the work surface and dough with flour as needed to prevent sticking . <p> Stop rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inverted pie pan . Place the rolling pin on the edge of the dough that 's farthest away from you , and roll the dough around the pin toward you , until you have about half of it on the pin . Gently move the rolling pin over the pie pan , and slowly unroll the dough , draping and centering it over the pan , and gently lift and coax down into the edges . <p> Trim the excess dough around the outside of the pan , leaving a 1/2- to 1-inch overhang that you can roll under the border to create a thick edge . Decorate the border as desired , either with the tines of a fork or your fingers . <p> At this point , it 's ready to bake and fill . <p> Chronicle Classic : Best Way Brined Turkey <p> Several years ago , we roasted nearly 40 turkeys in our test kitchen and found a brined turkey to be the best . Every year since , we 've retested the recipe . It 's still our favorite . <p> Do not use a self-basting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will be way oversalted if they 're brined .

Rinse well under cold tap water . Combine sugar , salt and 3-4 quarts of water in a large bowl . Stir until sugar and salt dissolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and juniper berries . <p> Use self-sealing brining bags or two heavy-duty , unscented trash bags not made of recycled materials , then put them in an ice chest that is large enough to hold the turkey . Place turkey in bags , pour in brine and remaining 1 1/2-1 3/4 gallons water - there should be enough liquid to completely cover the bird . Press out air in bags ; tightly close each bag separately . Keep turkey cold by piling bags of ice over and around the closed bags which will also help keep the turkey submerged . Brine for 12-24 hours . <p> Place turkey and brine in a large pan . Refrigerate for 12-24 hours . If turkey floats to top , weight it down with a plate and cans to keep it submerged in brine . <p> Preheat oven to 400 . Remove turkey from brine , rinse and dry well . Spread 2 tablespoons softened butter over skin . Sprinkle pepper over skin and in cavity . Tuck wing tips under , loosely truss legs and place turkey on a V-shaped rack in a roasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in oven.To assure that the bird cooks evenly , rotate roasting pan 180 every 30 minutes while turkey is roasting . Roast for about 1 hour , remove foil and baste turkey with 1/2 cup stock . Return to oven and roast , basting with pan drippings every 20 minutes , using more stock as needed . Start checking internal temperature after about 1 hour of roasting time . If legs begin to get too brown , cover loosely with foil . Roast turkey until internal thigh temperature reaches 165 . Total roasting time should be about 2 1/4-3 hours . Let bird rest for at least 20-30 minutes before carving . <p> Juniper berries are available in the spice section of some supermarkets and specialty grocers . <p> Best Way Unbrined Turkey <p> Preheat the oven to 400 . Prepare turkey according to instructions in Kitchen Essentials story on Page F1 . <p> Spread 2 tablespoons of softened butter over the skin and sprinkle 4 1/2 teaspoons of kosher salt and 1 1/2 teaspoons of ground pepper over the skin and in the cavity . <p> Tuck the wing tips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a V-shaped rack in a roasting pan . <p> Tent the breast with foil , place the turkey in the oven and roast according to the directions above . <p> Best Way Gravy for Brined Turkey <p> The amount of pan drippings will vary , depending on the size of the turkey , how much water or stock you use to baste it , and how much liquid evaporates during cooking . However , because the bird has been brined , you wo n't need to season the gravy as much . Streamline the gravy-making process - make the roux ahead of time , transfer it to a bowl , cool , then cover and refrigerate . <p> 4 tablespoons unsalted butter <p> 1/2 cup all-purpose flour <p>  --  Pan drippings to taste <p> 1/2 cup dry unoaked white wine optional <p> 4 cups low-salt canned chicken broth or homemade turkey broth/stock <p>  --  Freshly ground pepper to taste <p>  --  Kosher salt to taste <p> Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat .

Transfer to a bowl and set aside . <p> When the turkey is done , pour the pan drippings into a bowl . <p> Deglaze the roasting pan with the wine by boiling and scraping the pan with a wooden spoon , adding a little water as needed to incorporate the browned bits . Add to the drippings in the bowl . <p> Skim off the fat with a spoon , or refrigerate , then remove and discard the fat that congeals on top . <p> Put the roux in a skillet . Bring the broth to a simmer in a covered saucepan , then slowly add 3 cups of broth to the cold or room temperature roux , whisking constantly . <p> Add the reserved drippings slowly , starting with a few tablespoons ; taste , then whisk in more , a little at a time , until the gravy tastes right to you . Season with pepper and additional salt if needed . <p> To adjust the consistency , add more broth or simmer for a few minutes . Keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We like the chunkiness of the stuffing when the bread is in 1-inch pieces ; for a more uniform texture , cut into smaller pieces .

Soaking the turkey in a saltwater solution - usually with added sugar , herbs and spices - results in a juicy , plump bird with a firm , non-mealy texture . It also safeguards against drying out . The biggest obstacle is finding a vessel large enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it cold . We recommend a cooler with ice - it will keep the bird at the right temperature without taking up room in the fridge . Many stores sell self-sealing brining bags , but if you ca n't find one , two heavy-duty , unscented garbage bags will work as well . See Best Way Turkey recipe , Page F4 . <p> You can stuff a brined bird , but we do n't recommend it because the drippings from the roasting bird are salty , and they soak into the dressing . So if you must stuff a brined bird , do not season the stuffing with salt . <p> Plan on preparing twice as much stuffing , but bake all that does n't go into the turkey in a buttered casserole dish . You should have at least the same amount of dressing baked separately as will go in the turkey . <p> Be sure that the temperature of the stuffing in the turkey reaches 165 before serving . The turkey may be done also 165 before the stuffing is ready , so remove the stuffing from the turkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to the oven . <p> While the turkey is resting , the stuffing will have time to reach the recommended temperature . Before serving , mix together both batches . Taste and adjust the seasonings . <p> Bigger birds can be brined following the same recipe , and for the same amount of time 12 to 24 hours . When it comes to cooking , the recipe will work with a turkey that weighs up to 16 pounds . <p> Birds over 16 pounds should be roasted at a lower oven temperature , 350 degrees . Cover the breast tightly with foil for the first half of the cooking time , then remove the foil and baste with stock and pan drippings every 30-40 minutes for the remainder of the time . A 22-pound bird should be done in about 3 1/2 hours . <p> Start with a dry bird , inside and out . It 's a good idea let it sit out of the refrigerator or cooler for a few minutes just to take the chill off before prepping it and putting it in the oven - this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butter over the skin and season it liberally . If you 're using the brined turkey , do n't add extra salt - a generous amount of pepper is fine , over the skin and in the cavity . <p> Tuck the wing tips under the shoulders and truss the legs . This will ensure more even cooking and a nicer presentation . Place the turkey on a V-shaped rack in a roasting pan , and tent the breast with foil . Your turkey is ready to roast . See Best Way Turkey recipe , Page F4 . <p> After the appropriate amount of time in the oven , it 's wise to use an instant-read thermometer to ensure that your turkey has cooked through . We recommend an internal temperature of 165 , measured in the thigh . Any higher and the bird will dry out . <p> Insert the thermometer into the thickest part of the inner side of the thigh adjoining the drumstick and alongside the breast . It should be near but not touching the bone . <p> You can check the temperature of the breast as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breast area lightly with foil and continue cooking . Once you 've pulled it out , let it rest for at least 30 minutes . Now it 's ready to carve . <p> Carving your finished bird can be intimidating if you do n't have much experience , and there is more than one way to do this . One of the easiest methods is to remove the wings and thigh-leg quarters , and lift the two sides of the breast off the breast bone and rib cage . Cut the breast segments , across the grain , into 1/2-to 3/4-inch steaks . <p> Separate the thigh from the leg . Remove the thigh bone and cut the dark meat across the grain into steaks . If the drumsticks are big , you may also debone and steak-cut them . Otherwise
