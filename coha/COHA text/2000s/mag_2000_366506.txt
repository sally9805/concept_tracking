Gerald Ford came back from World War II , after a couple of brushes with death in the Pacific , determined to nudge the world toward peace . He climbed aboard history 's caravan in 1948 , when he won a Michigan seat in Congress ; then he held on for the full ride . The record of that journey is two-dimensional now , in pictures and cartoons tacked up on the wall of his quiet office along the Rancho Mirage , Calif. , fairways . But all that history is alive in his mind despite his 86 years  --  or maybe because of them  --  and it tumbles out in rich color . The sum of it is that Ford has been at the center of more history than any other living figure on this globe . <P> Only seconds after he was sworn in as a new Congressman , a slender , intense figure appeared at his elbow on the House floor . " Hello , " the man said , " I 'm Dick Nixon . " The two would be elbow to elbow 25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the helicopter that took the disgraced Nixon out of power and elevated Ford to the presidency . <P> Ford officed first across the hall from John Kennedy , already a two-year House veteran . " I could tell from the start , " claims Ford , " that the House was only a way station for him . " Fourteen years later , Ford would get a Sunday call from Lyndon Johnson , beating down Ford 's protests and ultimately persuading him to serve on the Warren Commission that investigated Kennedy 's assassination . He would fly to Dallas to interview Jack Ruby , the killer of Kennedy assassin Lee Harvey Oswald . " He was crazy " is Ford 's terse summation of Ruby . Ford is the only surviving member of the commission . <P> In those early days , Ford was invited to the White House by the natty , peppery Harry Truman , who wanted $5 million to renovate the crumbling building . Ford got the full treatment , with amateur architect Truman pointing out sagging floors and the lack of closets . Truman got his money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grateful for Truman 's home repair , especially for the famous Truman Balcony on the rear of the White House . ) And Truman got more : Ford 's support on foreign policy , even when Truman fired General Douglas MacArthur , though Ford still glows a bit when he recalls MacArthur 's " old soldiers " farewell to Congress . Says Ford : " One of the most moving speeches I 've ever heard . " <P> Ford joined the group of legislators pushing General Dwight Eisenhower to run for President . Soon Ford was on the delegation with Secretary of State John Foster Dulles to monitor the Korean cease-fire . Then he went to Saigon : " I remember the French generals with all their spit and polish giving us a two-hour briefing on how they were going to win the war in Vietnam . " It would be President Ford who inherited the final convulsion of that tragic war , made indelible by the pictures of desperate Vietnamese on a rooftop stairs trying to get on a departing helicopter . Ford insisted that a replica of the stairway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ museum . <P> In 1956 he was summoned to a secret meeting in the Capitol , where he learned he was to serve on the appropriations intelligence subcommittee . That was when he learned that the U.S. was overflying the Soviet Union with U-2 planes and preparing an invasion of Cuba at the Bay of Pigs .
