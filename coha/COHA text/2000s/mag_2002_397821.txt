Florida law enforcers mix matrimony and fighting crime // WHO 'S the chief at home ? " That 's the first question most people ask Fort Pierce , Fla. , Chief of Police Eugene ( Gene ) Savage and his wife , North Miami , Fla. , Chief of Police Gwendolyn V Boyd  --  Savage . The answer is simple-they both are . " Even when we were dating , I did n't have to suppress my feelings or emotions with him , " says Boyd-Savage . " I do n't have to genuflect to be accepted . He respects me and I respect him . " For the last two years , the couple has melded two top-level law enforcement careers and a marriage , and in a field where African-American chiefs of police are rare , this couple has the even rarer distinction of being police chiefs married to each other .

' ' " That night , he says , was the first time he talked with her , but he was a little distracted . " I was trying to get ready for the Fort Pierce position , and that was foremost on my mind at the time , " he says . The pair did n't move beyond mutual admiration until a NOBLE conference in Orlando , where she was the regional vice president and he was a presenter at the program . " Then the relationship gathered steam and momentum , " Savage says . " We had extensive conversations during that conference , but then she was in Prichard , Ala. , and I was in Fort Pierce , Fla. , and we e-mailed each other a lot .

" I thought I was going to be an old maid for the rest of my life , " she says laughing .

The law enforcers are uniquely suited to each other because they understand the nature of the job at the top level . " I do have a very strong personality and can be my natural self without trying to bite my words . I know when to shut up , back down or tone down . I do n't go overboard , " she says .

Last year they went to Paris , and this year 's plan is to go to Austrlalia . Even with all of the demands on their lives and the limited time they spend together , both say they are confident that this is one marriage that will work . " Being in law enforcement , " Boyd-Savage says , " we 've both seen a lot of marriages fall by the wayside , and we are committed to supporting each other and making our marriage work .
