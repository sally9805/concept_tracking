Graham O'Leary shoveled dirt with a vengeance , pushing himself until his muscles ached , because he needed the exertion . He was filled with nervous energy that had no place to go . This was Tuesday . That made it D-day . Amanda would either get her period or miss it . He hoped desperately that she would miss it , and only in part from wanting a child . The other part had to do with their marriage . They were feeling the strain of failing to conceive . A wall was growing between them . They were n't close the way they used to be . He could feel that she was pulling away . For Graham , it was dj vu . Grunting at the unfairness of that , he heaved an overloaded spadeful of dirt from the hole , but when he lowered the shovel again and pushed in hard , he hit rock . Swearing angrily , he straightened . Sometimes it seemed that rock was all he found . Forget the historic bit about stone walls marking one man 's land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were built just to get the damn rocks out of the fields ! Put ' em over near the other guy 's land , he imagined the old-timers saying . Only they 'd missed a few . Annoyed , he bent , worked his shovel under the rock , levered it up , and hauled it out . Clear of that impediment , he tossed spadefuls of dirt after it , one after the other in a steady rhythm . " Hey . " Oh , yeah , he knew what pulling away looked like . He had seen it in Megan , building slowly , mysteriously , reaching a point where he had no idea what she was thinking . With Amanda , he knew the cause of the problem , but that did n't make it easier to take . They used to be on the same wavelength on everything . Not anymore . Grunting again as he dug deeper , he remembered the tiff they 'd had the week before when he had tossed out the idea that she might be more relaxed , and therefore more apt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she spent at school . She did n't have to be the head of a dozen different programs , he had said in what he thought was a gentle tone . Others could do their part . That would allow her to come home early one or two afternoons each week ; she could read , cook , watch Oprah . She had gone ballistic over that . He was n't suggesting it again . " Gray . " Gritting his teeth , he hauled out another rock . Okay , so he was working longer hours , too . But he was n't the one whose body had to provide a hospitable environment for a child to take root . Not that he would even breathe that thought . She would take it as criticism . Lately , she misinterpreted lots of what he said . " Hey , you . " She 'd actually had the gall to accuse him of being absent for the second artificial insemination  --  like the thing could have been done without his sperm . Okay , so he 'd gone back to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave . Of course , now she was claiming that what she 'd said was that he did n't have to stay if he was uncomfortable . " Graham ! " His head flew up . His brother Will was squatting at the edge of the hole . " Hey . I thought you left . " The crew worked from seven to three . It was nearly five . " I came back . What are you doing ? " Planting his shovel in the dirt , Graham brushed spikes of wet hair back with an arm . " Providing a hospitable environment for this tree , " he said with a glance at the monster in question . It was a thirty-foot paper birch that would be the focal point of the patio he 'd designed . Not just any tree would do . It had taken him a while to find the right one . " The hole is crucial . It has to be plenty wide and plenty deep . " " I know , " Will replied . " That 's why I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I felt like getting the exercise , " Graham said offhandedly and went back to it . " Heard from Amanda yet ? " " Nah . " " You said she 'd call as soon as she knew . " " Well then , I guess she does n't know yet , " Graham said , but he was pissed . They had n't talked since he had left the house early that morning . If she 'd gotten her period , she was keeping it to herself . His phone was right there in his pocket , silent as stone . " Did you call her ? " Will asked . " No , " Graham said , pedantic now . " I called yesterday afternoon . She said I was pressuring her . " " Moody , huh ? " He sputtered out a laugh and tossed up another shovelful of dirt . " They say it 's the Clomid . But hey , it 's not easy for me either , and I 'm not taking the stuff . " Under his breath , he muttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No cause for that , " Will said . " You have n't lost it . You have an audience , y'know . " Graham paused , pushed his arm over his brow again , shot his brother a wry look . " Yup . " He went back to digging . " Pretty lady . " " Her husband 's an Internet wizard . They 're barely thirty and have more money than they know what to do with . So he plays with computers , and she watches the men who work on her lawn . It 's pretty pathetic , if you ask me . " " I 'd call it flattering . " Graham shot him another look . " You talk with her , then . " " Ca n't do . I got ta get home . Mikey and Jake have Little League . I 'm coach for the day . " He pushed himself up . " Do n't stay much longer , okay ? Leave something for the machine . " Still Graham dug for a while more , if only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dirt . By then his muscles were shot . Tossing the shovel out first , he hoisted himself out of the hole and made for his truck , a dark green pickup with the company logo in white on the side . He took a long drink of water from a jug in back , doused the end of a towel , and did what he could to mop sweat and clean up . A short time later , he pushed his arms into a chambray shirt and set off for home . * * * " Your move , " said Jordie Cotter from the edge of the deepest armchair in the office . He was fifteen and as sandy-haired as his three younger siblings , which Amanda knew not because she kept detailed files on every student , but because the Cotters lived two doors away from Graham and her . In fact , she had no file on Jordie at all . He would n't be in her office playing checkers with her if he thought he was being counseled . For the record , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headed the program . This was the third time he 'd come , though . There was a message in that . Grateful to be distracted from thinking about the baby that was or was n't , Amanda studied the checkerboard . There were five black pieces , four of them kinged , and three reds , all single . The reds were hers , which meant she was definitely losing . " I do n't have many choices , " she said . " Make your move . " Picking the lesser of the evils , Amanda moved in a way that she figured would sacrifice only one piece . When Jordie jumped two , she sucked in a breath . " I did n't see that coming . " He did n't smile , did n't pump a fist in the air . He simply said again , " Your turn . " She studied her options . When she looked up at the boy , he was somber . " Do it , " he challenged . When she did , he jumped her last checker to win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , there was no sense of victory . Rather , he asked , " Did you let me win on purpose ? " " Why would I do that ? " He shrugged and looked away . He was a handsome boy , despite the gangliness that said he was still growing into his limbs . But his T-shirt and jeans were several notches above sloppy , his hair was clean and trimmed , and he did n't have acne , not that many students here did . In affluent towns like Woodley , dermatologists did as well as orthodontists . " You want to be liked , " he answered without looking at her . " It helps if you lose . " Amanda drew in a deep breath . " Well , I do know how that is . I used to do it in school sometimes  --  you know , deliberately blow an exam so that I would n't look like a geek . " " I would n't do that , " Jordie said . Amanda did n't believe him . Oh , maybe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were other possibilities , not the least of which was the tension she knew existed at home . But something was definitely going on with the boy . His grades had taken a dive at midterm , and the expression he had taken to wearing around school was the sullen one he wore now . His eyes met hers . They were dark and wary . " Did my mom say anything to you ? " " About the grades ? No . And she does n't know we 've talked . " " We have n't talked . Not like , talked . " He glanced at the checkerboard . " This is n't talking . It 's just better than doing homework . " Amanda touched her heart . " Ach . That hurts . " " Is n't that why you have things to do here ? To make kids want to come ? " " They 're called icebreakers . " He snorted . " Like Harry Potter ? " he said with a glance at the book on her desk . " I think Harry 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His twin brothers were eight . " I tell them Harry flies through our woods on his broomstick . That keeps them from following me in there . Our woods are cool . They 're real . Harry 's not . " Sitting forward , he began resetting the checkers on the board . " About the CS requirement ? I 'd do peer counseling if I thought I could , but I ca n't . " " Why not ? " " I 'm not good at talking . " " Seems to me you talk with your friends . " " They talk . I listen . " " Well , there you go , " Amanda said in encouragement . " That 's what peer counseling 's about . Kids need to vent , and you 're a good listener . " " Yeah , but sometimes I want to say things . " " Like what ? " He raised unhappy eyes . " Like school sucks , like home sucks , like baseball sucks . " " Baseball . I thought you liked baseball . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a rough one . " I 'd like it if I played , but I do n't . I sit on the bench all the time . Know how embarrassing that is ? With all the kids watching ? With my parents watching ? Why do they have to come to games ? They could miss one or two . I mean , my mom is always at school . Julie loves it , but what does she know ? She 's only six . " " Your mom does good stuff for the schools . " " Know how embarrassing that is ? " " Actually , " Amanda said , taking a calculated risk , " I do n't . My parents were too busy fighting with each other to have the time or energy for either my school or me . " Jordie lifted a shoulder . " Mine fight . They just do it when they think we ca n't hear . " Amanda made a noncommittal sound , but did n't speak . Taking the moment 's space to gather his thoughts , Jordie went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly upmost in his mind . " And even if we ca n't hear , we can see , " he said . " Mom hardly ever smiles anymore . She does n't plan fun things like she used to . Like sleepovers for all our friends . " He caught himself . " I mean , it 's not like I want those anymore , I 'm too old , but Julie and the twins are n't . Mom used to have twenty of us over at once with popcorn and pizza and videos , and I did n't even care if the little kids were bugging me and my friends , because that was all part of it , y'know ? " His enthusiasm gave way to a somber silence , then anger . " Now she just pokes her head in my room asking nosy questions . " " Fuck it , " came a high , nasal voice . Amanda frowned at the neon green parrot in a cage at the end of the room . " Hush up , Maddie . " Jordie stared at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come they let you keep her ? " " She only swears for kids . She knows better when it comes to Mr. Edlin or any of the teachers . She 's perfectly polite when they 're in here . " Like checkers , Maddie was an icebreaker . Some students stopped by daily for a month to give the bird treats before they felt comfortable enough to talk with Amanda . " She 's a good bird , " Amanda cooed in the direction of the cage . " I love you , " Maddie replied . " She flips ? " Jordie asked . " Just like that ? Is she a good guy or a bad guy ? " " A good guy . Definitely . Good guys can say bad things when they 're upset . Maddie learned to swear from someone who used to chase her with a broom , which was how I came to adopt her . She knows what anger sounds like . She gets upset when kids get upset , like you just did about baseball . " " I was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No . He had been talking about his mother . But , of course , he knew that , which was why he was on his feet now , hoisting the backpack to his shoulder . Talking about parents was hard for kids like Jordie . Talking about feelings was even harder . Jordie needed an outside therapist , someone who did n't know his family . For that to happen , though , either he or one of his parents had to take the initiative . None of them was doing it , yet . So Amanda went out of her way to be there when Jordie came by . Unfortunately , she could n't make him stay . Before she could utter a word , he was out the door and tromping down the empty hall , lost again in whatever dark thoughts were haunting him . Wait , she wanted to say . We can talk about it . We can talk about moms fighting with dads , how you feel about it , what you 're doing when you 're supposed to be studying , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free . I can talk . I can talk as long as you want . I have to keep my mind busy . But he was gone , and as they had been doing all day , her eyes went to the desk and Graham 's picture . It was in a neat slate frame , his smile beaming at her through his trim beard . It was a face that many a female entering this room had remarked upon . Graham O'Leary was an icebreaker , too . She had to call him . He would be waiting to hear . But she did n't know anything yet , and she might not for hours . Besides , lately it seemed that the only thing she and Graham were about was having a baby  --  and , oh , did she feel the pressure of that . He had done his part successfully , and more than once . Her body was the problem . Of course , he did n't say that in as many words , but he did n't need to . She felt his impatience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emily 's instructions to the letter  --  had eaten well , rested well , exercised in the most healthy and normal of ways , except for today . Loath to do anything that might bring on her period , she was moving as little as possible . It was nonsense , of course . Normal physical movement would n't wreck a normal pregnancy . At this point , though , she was desperate . She had n't left her office since lunch , and though she might have liked to use the bathroom , she quelled the urge . As a diversionary measure , she sat back in the sofa , checked her watch , and thought about Quinn Davis . It was five-thirty . She had told the boy she would be in her office until six , and so she would be . His notes unsettled her . They had come by e-mail , the first sent early that morning saying , " I need to talk to you , but it 's private . Is that okay ? " " Private is definitely okay , " Amanda had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and me . That 's the law . I 'm free third period . Would that work ? " He had n't shown up during third period , but another e-mail arrived during fourth . " Would my parents have to know that we met ? " " No , " Amanda replied . " That 's part of the confidentiality rule . They would n't know unless you sign a form saying it 's okay . I have a free half hour right after school , but if you have to be at baseball practice , we could make it later . I 'll stay until six . Will that work ? " She had n't heard back . Nor had she heard footsteps in the hall to suggest that Quinn had come while Jordie was there , and she 'd been listening . Something was up with Quinn . Her instincts told her so , and it had nothing to do with the fact that he approached her by e-mail . Many students did that , precisely because it was more private . She often suggested meeting times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye on the student or perhaps sending a follow-up note , there was nothing she could do . She could n't force the issue . But Quinn Davis was n't her usual case . He was a star . In addition to being sophomore class president , he was a peer counselor , high scorer of the varsity basketball team the past winter , and now he was the wunderkind of the baseball team . Two older brothers , both leaders at Woodley High , were currently at Princeton and West Point . Their parents were local activists , often in the papers , forever in Hartford lobbying for one cause or another . Amanda wondered if Quinn would show and , if so , what he would say . It could be that he wanted to tell Amanda about a student who needed help ; part of the point of the peer leadership program was to identify problem students before they exploded . Student referrals were responsible for easily a third of the students she regularly saw . But she doubted that was the case here , with the student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shoes , Amanda folded her legs beside her . She was tired emotionally ; that was a given . She was also physically tired , though if she dared think that it might be the earliest sign of pregnancy , she got a nervous knot in her belly . In any event , she was grateful that her job allowed for casual dress . Allowed for ? Demanded . The students had to perceive her as both professional and approachable , no mean feat for someone like Amanda , whose small size and wayward blond curls made her look more like she was twenty-five than thirty-five . The challenge was to appear more sophisticated , yet not formidable . Today 's outfit worked . It was a plum-colored blouse and pants , both in a soft rayon . A noise came from the hall  --  a muted sound that could have been an anguished shout  --  then silence . Fearing that it was Quinn and that something was terribly wrong , Amanda jumped up from the sofa and went to the door . Down the hall , immobile and alert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ janitor . " Heeeere 's Johnny , " sang out Maddie from the depths of her office . Amanda let out a breath . " Mr. Dubcek . " The man was white-haired and stooped , eighty if he was a day , but he refused to retire . He was remembered not only by parents of current students , but by grandparents as well . That gave him clout in the respect department . He was never spoken of as Johann , always Mr. Dubcek  - -  except for Maddie , but then , Maddie did n't know about respect . She only knew that the old man fed her and cleaned out her cage and took her every night to his small apartment in the basement of the school . " I was listening for voices , " the janitor told Amanda in a rusty voice . " I'd'a gone away if you had someone in there . I did n't want to interfere . " " No one 's here , " she said with a smile , but the smile faded when , standing now , giving gravity its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she went down the hall to the lavatory . Well before she closed the stall door and lowered those soft plum pants , she knew . In that instant , pummeled by a dozen emotions , not the least of which was a profound sense of loss , her mind closed down . Sinking onto the toilet , she put her elbows on her thighs and her face in her hands and began to cry . She must have been there a while , because the next thing she knew , there was a loud knock on the outer door and the janitor 's frightened call : " Mrs. O'Leary ? Are you all right ? " Mrs. O'Leary . Ah , the irony of that . Professionally , she had always been Amanda Carr . She had surely introduced herself to the janitor that way four years before . At the same time , though , she had introduced him to Graham , who was helping her set up her office . She had been Mrs. O'Leary to the proper old gentleman ever since . And what was wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing at all . She was proud to be married to Graham . She had always believed that once they had kids she would use O'Leary more often than Carr . Once they had kids . If they had kids . And that was what was wrong with being Mrs. O'Leary today . Without the kids , did she have a right to the name ? Tears came again . " Mrs. O'Leary ? " the janitor called again . Sniffling , she wiped the tears with the heels of her hands . " I 'm fine , " she called in an upbeat , if nasal , voice . " Be right out . " After dealing with necessities in the stall , she washed her hands and pressed a damp paper towel to her eyes . A headache was starting to build over the right one , but she did n't have the wherewithal to pamper it here , much less the strength to deal with whatever was ailing Quinn Davis . Praying that the boy would not show up , she returned to her office , repaired her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , locked up her files , and , waving at the janitor 's distant figure on her way down the hall , left school . * * * Graham considered prolonging the trip home . There were places he could stop , ten minutes here , ten there , giving Amanda more time to call . But the suspense was too much . He kept the truck on the highway and his foot on the gas . The phone rang . His heart began to pound . " Hi ? " he answered as much in question as greeting , but it was n't Amanda . It was a woman who owned a real estate firm and had hired him to redo the office grounds . The job was small , the potential large . The woman 's clientele was high-end . If she liked what he did , she would recommend his work , and while he had plenty to keep him busy , he always welcomed more . Lately , given the tension between Amanda and him , his work was his salvation . " I was just wondering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmly . He drove with his left hand while the right opened his little black book . " You 're on my call list . I 'll have your plans ready by the first of the week . " He flipped several pages , darting glances at each . " How does a week from today sound ? Say , four ? " " Perfect . Next Tuesday at four . See you then . " Graham barely ended the call when the phone rang again . Again , his heart began to pound , but it was n't Amanda this time , either . It was his brother Joe . " Any news ? " Graham let out a breath . " Nah . I 'm headed home . " " Mom was asking . " " I 'll bet she was . I have to tell you , there are times when I wish I had n't said anything to anyone . " " We asked . " So they had . The questions had started one month into his marriage , and they had n't stopped . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want children , and would they please bug off . Having his entire family know what they were going through was nearly as humiliating as jerking off into a jar . O'Leary men did n't have to do things like that . Hell , Joe had recently had his fifth child , and Graham suspected he and Christine were n't done yet . " She 's beginning to despair , " Joe said now of their mother , Dorothy . " Says she wants to see your kids before she dies . " " She 's only seventy-seven . " " She says she 's growing frail . " Graham felt a cursed helplessness . " What more does she think I should do ? " " She says this is her last wish . " " Joe . Come on . This is n't what I need right now . " " I know . I 'm just putting you on notice . She keeps saying it should have been Megan . " That was nothing new . " Well , it is n't Megan  --  it ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be Megan , " Graham declared . " Help me out here , Joe , " he pleaded . " Remind her I 'm married to Amanda . If I 'm going to have a baby , it 'll be Amanda 's . Hey , there 's my call waiting , " he lied , but he could n't keep this particular conversation going . " I 'll get back to you later . " He disconnected without another word and drove on in brooding silence . This damned day was nearly done . He did n't know why Amanda was keeping him in the dark . Even if she did n't know anything yet , she could have called and told him that . She knew he was waiting . Turning off the highway , he drove along roads that he knew now like the back of his hand , and there was some solace in that . He loved Woodley , loved the way the town roads twisted and climbed through forested hills . A map of the town was like a tree  --  a trunk that rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hill , spilling off in two directions with limbs bearing town buildings , offices , and stores , branches off those limbs for houses , and , farther down the branches , neat cul-de-sacs like the one he and Amanda lived on . No road in the town was barren . Each was bounded by white pine , beech , and hemlock , or maples , or birches , or oaks . Climbing into a curve now , he passed a meadow of red trillium . Farther on , he saw yellow trout lily , and beyond that , a dense stand of mountain laurel with its perfect white blossoms . A less-knowing passerby would n't have picked out the jack-in-the-pulpit with its maroon hood from the shade at the side of the road , but Graham did . Likewise , at a glance , he could differentiate maidenhair fern from oak fern or bracken , or lichen from moss . These woods had them all . Graham took pride in that . His own hometown , where much of his family still lived , lay only fifty minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart . That one was a working-class enclave filled with good folk who dreamed of living here . For Graham , the dream had come true . At least , one part of it had . They were still working on the other part , and if the news was good today , he would be doubly thankful he lived here . When it came to hospitable environments in which to raise kids , Woodley took the cake . The town center was nestled around the fork in the road at the top of the hill . The three streets intersecting at its core were lined with beech trees , wood benches , and storefronts that were as inviting in winter white as they were now in May . The smells were as rich as the populace  --  hot sticky buns from the bakery , a dark roast blend from the caf , chocolate from fresh dipped fruit at the candy store . Give or take , there were a dozen small restaurants on side streets to serve an upscale population of fourteen thousand , but the food staple was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast , lunch , and dinner at wrought-iron tables in a glassed-in patio in winter and an open one in summer . Several doors down , past an art gallery and an antiques store , a bookshop was stocked to the eaves , and what parent in his or her right mind would go elsewhere when this one employed a full-time storyteller for kids ? There were boutique-type clothing stores scattered around , a drugstore whose owner cared enough about his clients to advise them when medications clashed , a hardware store , a camera shop , and  --  the latest  --  a tea caf . Some of the stores took up the two floors that the town fathers had decreed would be the height limit , but those second-floor spaces also housed lawyers , doctors , interior designers , and the like . Graham 's office was over a housewares store that had sent more than one newcomer to Woodley his way . He did n't stop at the office now . Nor did he stop at Woodley Misc , the general store , though an SUV pulled from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would have swung in and run inside to buy an Almond Joy for Amanda . Amanda loved Almond Joys . This day , though , he did n't have the patience for chitchat , which was what one could count on getting at Woodley Misc . Besides , he was annoyed at Amanda for not calling , for not thinking about him for a change . He was annoyed at her for not being long since pregnant , period . That thought stopped him cold . He knew it was unfair , but his mind did n't take it back , which left him feeling more than a little guilty . It was with a deliberate effort that he propped his left elbow on the open window , draped his right wrist over the back of the passenger 's seat , and made like all was well and that he was cool . * * * Amanda 's numbness wore off during the drive home from school , and the enormity of the situation sank in . There would be no baby . Again . No baby . She felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She and Graham had been so cautious this time , not daring to get carried away . Still , they had talked of hanging a stocking on Christmas Eve for the baby about to be born , and of having something new to toast this New Year 's Eve . They had talked about how much easier the O'Leary holiday bedlam would be if they were about to have a child of their own . Pulling the tortoiseshell comb from her hair , she shook her head to spread out the curls and tried to relax with positive thoughts . She had plenty to be grateful for , plenty that others did n't have . For starters , she had a beautiful house on a charming wooded cul-de-sac in an upscale neighborhood  --  a perfect place for kids . Only she did n't have the kids yet . But she did have three neighbors , two of whom had become close friends . The third , Ben 's young widow , kept to herself , but the others more than compensated with front-yard visits in spring , backyard cookouts in summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter . More important , there were countless woman-to-woman talks on the phone , on porch steps , or by the Cotters ' pool . She could use one of those talks now . Either woman would tell her how envious they were . Neither of them had the kind of career she did . Karen worked hard without benefit of either a paycheck or respect , and the trade-off for Georgia , who got a large paycheck indeed , was being out of town and away from her family several days a week . Amanda was n't paid a lot , but her career was n't about money . She simply loved the work  --  and talk about convenience ? The school was ten minutes from her home . If she had a baby , she could exchange her full-time position there for one as a consulting psychologist . She would have as large or small a caseload as she wanted , and could see students right at the house . The office over the garage had its own entrance . If she had kids , it would be perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an SUV that was de rigueur in Woodley . Granted , it was four years old and starting to show its age . In the past few months , they 'd had to replace the fuel-injection system , the suspension , and the battery . They talked about getting a new car , but then month after month passed without her conceiving , and it seemed foolish . The car purred happily enough now as she turned off the main road and drove through a gently winding stretch of wooded land . A final turn , and the cul-de-sac came into view . Graham 's truck was not in the driveway . Not quite sure how she felt about that , she opened both front windows and , with the flow of warm air through the car , let the circle soothe her . With May just days old , the landscaping around the four houses was coming to life . The grass had greened up and just been cut , leaving horizontal swathes and a lingering scent . Huge oaks ringing the dead end had leafed out into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were dripping with buds . The crocuses had come and gone , as had the forsythia blossoms , but patches of yellow daffodils remained , and tulips were starting to bloom . Clusters of lilacs stood tall and fat at each porch rail ; though still a week shy of full bloom , they were budded enough to perfume the air . Turning into her driveway , Amanda breathed it all in . Spring was her very favorite season . She had always loved the freshness , the cleanness , the sense of birth . Sense of birth . Shifting into park , she stepped on the emergency brake and wondered why it always came back to that . Many people went through life without being parents . Some women she knew were actively choosing not to have kids , and they were perfectly satisfied with their lives . The thing was that she did want them , only it was n't happening , and she did n't know why . Was this her punishment for wanting a career of her own ? For keeping her maiden name ? For delaying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time conceiving ten years before , but she had n't been ready to have a baby at twenty-five . She had n't even known Graham then . And he had been worth the wait . She still believed that . Her mother believed otherwise . She believed that the genetic differences between them were simply too great for conception . Graham was tall , solid , and green-eyed ; she was small , lean , and brown-eyed . He had straight dark hair ; hers was curly and blond . He had seven siblings ; she was a lonely only child . He was athletic ; she was not . As far as Amanda was concerned , her mother was a snob , and her theory was hogwash . But that did n't lessen the pain she felt now . They 'd had such high hopes this time . Graham was going to be upset . She should have called him . Cell phones , like e-mail , were less intimidating than having to say some things face-to-face . She might have broken the news that way . Shared the sorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But her courage failed her . Disheartened about that failing on top of the other , she gathered up her briefcase and had straightened when a movement in the rear-view mirror caught her eye . It was the widow , Gretchen Tannenwald , wandering along her newly edged flower beds . She had spent long hours the fall before putting in bulbs , working with her back to the neighbors , keeping to herself even when others were out and about . Attempts at friendliness on their part were met with the briefest possible response . Even Amanda , who was supposedly good at it , had made a try or two , but Gretchen was no talker . Hard to believe that she had been married to the ever-genial Ben . Then again , not hard to believe at all . Gretchen was barely half Ben 's age and the total antithesis of June , but he had needed a drastic change to pull him from his grief . The neighborhood men were sympathetic . " You can see she idolizes him , " said Russ Lange , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leland Cotter , the dot-com chief , was more blunt . " What 's not to love ? She 's a looker . " Graham suggested that Ben loved her energy . " She has him traveling and hiking and playing tennis . He and June led a quieter life . Gretchen opens new doors . " The neighborhood women were less generous . As far as they were concerned , the Tannenwald marriage was about two things : sex for Ben and money for Gretchen . Of course , that did n't explain why Gretchen was hanging around without Ben . Amanda had thought she would sell the house , take the money , and run . But here she was , wearing a short , swingy dress that made her look even younger than thirty-two . Actually , Amanda decided with a start , the dress made her look pregnant . Unsettled by that , she twisted around to look out the rear window . It was a minute before the light caught Gretchen 's body in profile again , and there it was , something that did indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ben had been gone a year , too long to be part of it , and Gretchen had been a virtual shut-in since his death . She did n't date ; surely they would have noticed . To Amanda 's knowledge , the only men who had been in the house for any period of time were the plumber , the carpenter , and the electrician  --  and , on one mission or another , Russ Lange , Lee Cotter , and Graham O'Leary.
