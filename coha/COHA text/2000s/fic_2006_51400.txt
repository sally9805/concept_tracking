from The Searchers <p> The song on the radio reminded him of Puerto Morelos . It was syrupy and trashy and reminded him of the girl he 'd loved there , briefly , at sixteen . Reminded him of ceviche made fresh on the beach and bananas con leche , and of the couple who owned the bar , Tony , the gringo hippie and his fine-assed Mexican wife and their three strange children , who had blond hair and brown skin and if you squinted your eyes just right looked like photographic negatives . <p> The American asphalt rippled before him in the midday heat . August was upon them . Ruby panted in the back of the pickup , her tongue rolled out like a red carpet , boxes piled around her on all sides . <p> Up ahead sat a stucco fortress with a neon sign in front that read " Loma Lodge . " It looked more like a motel than an apartment complex , but there was a sign in the yard that read VACANCY so this had to be it . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing on the front lawn hosing down a row of shrubs . She was what they called here " morbidly obese . " It was Tony who taught him that expression . Hector , the first time he heard it , thought morbid was the same word as mortal . But Tony explained that " morbid " meant " diseased . " Same difference . Anyway , they did n't have an expression like that in Mexico . There , people were just gorditos-and gorditos in Mexico were not nearly as big as the gorditos here . Maybe that was why they 'd needed to invent another term , for when things went too far . <p> The woman turned off the hose and peered at him from behind mirror sunglasses . <p> " You here about the apartment ? " She moved slowly toward him , huffing and puffing in a lime green muumuu . <p> " Yeah , hi . I 'm Hector . " He held out a hand . She gave him hers . It was small and dainty and cold , and he pulled away quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth moved in and out of her face as she spoke . " Welcome to San Diego . " <p> She pointed a finger at Ruby , who stood on a leash at his side . " What 's that ? Some kind of Mexican street dog ? We only got pure breeds here . I specialize in teacup poodles , and next door , my son , Freddie , he breeds pit bulls . All pedigreed . They 're in the back . We sell ' em at cut-rate discounts , if you know anybody who 's looking . I still got an apricot left over from the last litter . Reggie . I got all his papers , too . " <p> Hector nodded , watching her face as she spoke , trying to decide how old she was . The false teeth , the wispy dandelion hair interrupted by bald patches , suggested a woman well in her fifties , but her face was completely unlined . <p> She started toward the metal staircase . " Come on , let 's get this show on the road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Hector , good as he was at English , had to struggle to make sense of what she said . She owned this building with her sister , Betty Savage . Her son , Freddie , was the building superintendent . It used to be a motel , yeah , but they 'd converted it into apartments about five years ago . They 'd bought it with money they made in the lottery . Not a Big Sweeps win , but a scratch card Double Whammy , believe it or not . <p> " We mind our own business at the Loma Lodge , " Gail said , as they neared the landing . " I do n't ask no questions . You can grow dope and murder prostitutes up here for all I care . There 's only one thing I ca n't stand , it 's a complainer . Last girl we had in your place complained about every little thing . Toilet was running . So jiggle the handle . Leak in the ceiling . So patch it up . This ai n't the motherfucking Ritz-Carlton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathed heavily for a moment , holding a palm to her chest . Hector wondered if she was okay . But after a moment she continued . " The bitch did n't know how to do nothin ' for herself . You know the type . Always bringing a new man back here , usually some brotha in a pimp mobile , excuse my French . Had to call the police few times . " Gail made her voice go high in mock femininity . " Oh no , we was just having a domestic quarrel . ' Yeah , right . Fat lip . Busted eye . Domestic quarrel , my ass . Hermaline was her name . Lazy ho bag from Reseda . From now on , I do n't rent out to no spoiled American cunts . You Messicans are all right by me . " <p> Gail stopped at a door in the middle of the second-floor landing , and tried to find the right key . She glanced up at him , over her sunglasses . <p> " You should feel right at home . Half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't mind . Long as the money is U.S. Tender . " <p> The place had been advertised as a one bedroom , but inside , he learned the " bedroom " was just a walk-in closet . <p> " Cozy , right ? " <p> Hector stood behind her , staring over her head into the windowless box . On the floor , filling the entire space , was a filthy mattress . <p> " Hermaline got that in here . Do n't know how she did it , but she did . It 's yours if you want . " <p> Hector turned away from the closet , eyes stinging . There was a taste growing in his mouth . The taste that had begun his first night in this new country . The living room was not much bigger than the closet , and there was a urine-colored stain on the far wall in the shape of a boot . <p> Ruby , at least , seemed happy . She was frantic , trying to get something out from under the radiator . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tail wagging , her butt in the air . <p> On his last night in Puerto Morelos , Hector had gone for a walk on the beach with Ruby , trying to burn into his memory the sights and smells and sounds of the only home he 'd ever known . He 'd stared over the silver water at IsIa Mujeres on the other side where the gringos went for holiday and hookers . That was the same night his mother had called him a maricon for leaving . She said it was the fault of that dirty gringo , Tony . And maybe she was right . It was Tony who had filled his head with dreams about " the sugar bowl " up north , and Tony who had given him the opportunity to start over . If given the chance , who would n't have left that village-which the tourists ' guide gave a starred review to , as if it were a restaurant , calling it " picturesque " and " swimmable " and " cheap " - where gringos came to take snapshots of themselves and blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sneakers " and talk to him like he was a village idiot ? <p> Anyway , there were too many birth defects in Puerto Morelos . Too many extra thumbs . <p> Ruby got ahold of what she was after-a brown plastic kewpie doll in a hula skirt . Something you find floating in a Polynesian drink . With a satisfied plop , the dog lay down and began to chew on the doll 's head . <p> " See , every time I come up here I find more junk Hermaline left behind . I told her to clean the place before she left , but she did n't listen . That 's why I kept her deposit . Fair is fair . She came back , crying like a baby , saying she needed the cash for a set of new titties . Saying her implant exploded . But I told her she shoulda thought of that when she left the place in stank condition . " <p> Hector wandered around the main room . He pretended to be inspecting the premises , but he already knew he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was illegal , he had a dog . What choice did he have ? The ad had said " DOG FRIENDLY , " and Ruby was the only friend he had in this country . Anyway , it was n't that bad . It got some light from the west , and it was close to the freeway and the beach , and with a little bit of cleaning , it might even be cheerful . <p> In the bathroom , he found the toilet still running . There were more of Hermaline 's leftovers in there , too . On the counter sat an unopened package of Lee Press-On Nails in fire-engine red and a bag of pink hair rollers . Gail came up behind him . He could smell her sweat and feel her heat and hear her chronic sinusitis . She breathed like Darth Vader . <p> " Do n't even tell me . She left more crap behind . It multiplies . Every time I think I got everything , there 's something new to throw away . Hand me that crap , will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a kitchen-or a counter , anyway , on the far wall , with a sink and a hot plate and a couple of drawers . Hector stared out the window above the sink onto the backyard . " That 's our kennel down there , " he heard Gail say behind him . And sure enough , on one side of the yard was a giant pen holding what looked like pit bulls . On the other , a smaller pen where he could make out a few rats scuttling around , rats that had to be teacup poodles . A chubby boy in a T-shirt stood taunting a pit bull with a cone over its head . He kept poking the dog with a stick , then moving out of its range of vision , laughing , while the pit bull turned in circles , trying to see past the cone . A girl stood at the edge of the lawn with her arms crossed , laughing . <p> Hector found the scene depressing , and his gaze searched beyond the yard , to the house next door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stucco of the neighborhood . It looked like a barn , with red wood shingles and two giant doors that reminded him of Mr. Ed . A clothesline hung in its backyard with a row of white shirts flapping in the breeze . Parked along the side of the house was an old yellow school bus . <p> " So you gon na take it or not ? Cuz I do n't got all day . " <p> He turned to face her . " Yeah , yeah . Sure , I 'll take it . " <p> Behind her , across the room , he saw Ruby , mouth open , tongue out , gagging . She had eaten most of the kewpie doll but was having trouble swallowing the skirt . <p> Out by the truck , Gail counted his money twice . Her sonFreddie-and his girlfriend leaned against a wall , French kissing . He kneaded the girl 's ass as if it were pizza dough . <p> Gail stuffed the money in her muumuu pocket and looked at Hector in the eye . <p> " So you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gesture of friendship . He could tell . " Probably . " <p> " Yeah , maybe , but maybe she deserved it . I mean , what was she doing , a mother of two , running around with a Jewboy after dark ? That 's all I 'm saying . She was looking for trouble . " <p> She handed Hector a set of two keys held together by a paper clip , then turned and shuffled slowly in the direction of Freddie and his girlfriend , who were grinding their hips against each other . Hector heard her mumble to them , " Take that shit inside . " <p> That night , Hector woke to the sound of singing . Outside , in the house across the way , people were emerging from those barn doors in white clothes , their heads shaved . They were carrying hammers and nails and planks of wood as they herded onto the school bus . From far away , Hector could n't tell which ones were boys and which ones were girls . They were all so skinny , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could see the whites of their teeth flashing in the dark . <p> Canvas . The word was a noun-not a verb-according to his Spanish-American dictionary . It meant a heavily woven piece of fabric . But in the classified ad , it was being used as a verb . To canvas . Canvaser . <p> WANTED ! ! ! <p> BRIGHT SOCIALLY-RESPONSIBLE <p> AND OUTGOING PEOPLE TO CANVASS <p> ON BEHALF OF PROP 297 . <p> Prop 297 ? The dictionary said a " prP " was un accesorio , something you used in the theater to make a play look real . A toy gun . A rubber chicken . Those were props . What was the 29/th prop ? The ad did n't explain further . And if it had n't been for the small print , he would not have given the ad a second glance : No experience necessary . Earn up to $350 a week ! They were holding group interviews today between nine o'clock and noon . It was already eight-thirty . Hector stroked Ruby 's head . He knew he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that in America , all that mattered was how you looked . " These companies , all they care is that your teeth are straight and that your pants are ironed . " Yes , he should get up and floss his teeth and iron his chinos . But he was tired . So was Ruby , she lay like a stuffed animal at his side . If he could only have a few more minutes ' sleep under the covers . But no . Tony said employers wanted you to be punctual . " There ai n't no siestas up in los Estados Unidos , You got ta show up earlier than the early worm , if you know what I mean . " Tony said the work itself did n't matter . As long as you showed up early , you could fritter the whole day away at the water cooler . <p> Hector closed his eyes and felt sleep pushing down on him like a pillow . He had gotten maybe two hours last night . First it had been the neighbors , with their singing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors after dark . Then , just when he 'd begun to get used to their racket , just as it had merged with his dreams , the cops showed up in a whirl of sirens . Hector went to the kitchen window , thinking they had to be coming for the neighbors-but the sirens came closer , then turned in the parking lot of the Loma Lodge . Hector 's mouth went dry . He peeked through the curtain to see , yes , a couple of policemen swaggering toward the building . They were coming for him . His short-lived adventure was over . They 'd figured him out . They were coming to get him and send him back home in a bus , where the Mexican authorities would deal with him in a court of law . <p> And he knew now , with a sudden certainty , that he wanted to be here , en los Estados Unidos . He had not been so sure before . But now , with the threat of eviction moving down the walkway toward him in two blue suits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , as much as he was homesick for Puerto Morelos , as much as he hated La Jolla , with its blue-haired white women and their stretched-tight skin , as much as Gail Grinds and Freddie and their poodles and pit bulls were an eyesore to him every day when he left his humble abode , he wanted to be here . He did n't know why . His lifestyle here was far worse than it was at home . Every day was a new degradation . Yet sad as it was to admit , he felt more alive far from his family than near it . <p> As a child , in photographs , his sister , Marisol , once pointed out that he was never looking at the camera , never smiling , always looking somberly off into the distance . There are those who are driven to leave home , to wander , and those who want to stay home , mired in the familiar . <p> Ruby growled at the sound of the police voices down on the lawn . Hector gripped a hand around her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her throat . He peeked out the window again , expecting to see the cops coming up the stairs , tried to think of an exit strategy . But no , the cops were not coming up the stairs . And faintly , he heard them pounding on a door downstairs . Freddie 's door . <p> " Open up . Open up . Anybody in there ? " <p> Hector went to the door and opened it a crack so that he could hear their voices floating up . <p> " You looking for my mother ? " <p> " Is her name Betty Savage ? " <p> " No , my moms is Gail Grinds . " <p> " Then who 's Betty Savage ? " <p> " My ant . " <p> " Where does your ant live ? " <p> Hector laughed aloud . They were n't here for him or any of the other Mexicans . They were here for the morbida gordita . But why ? Curious , he stepped out onto the landing , and as if on cue then , all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 'd all been listening , and they 'd all just discovered the police were here for los locos gringos downstairs , for the invisible hermana , Betty , the sister they heard about but never saw . <p> Hector stood on the balcony with the rest , Ruby on a leash at his side . He nodded hello to his neighbors , who stood in their pajamas , scratching their heads and murmuring about the drama going down right here at the Loma Lodge . <p> Hector leaned over the railing to watch the action from a bird's-eye view . Freddie , in a yellow T-shirt with the words " SHUT UP STUPID BITCH " across it , was leading the cops across the courtyard to the door where Gail and her little sister , Betty Savage , lived . <p> But before they could get to the door , Gail emerged from inside . She pulled the door shut behind her . <p> " What the fuck 's going on out here ? Freddie , you in trouble again ? " <p> " No . " <p> She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was plastered to her scalp . A cigarette hung from her lips . <p> " Ma'am , " one of the police officers said , stepping forward . " Is your name Betty Savage ? " <p> Gail paused to look up , eying the row of tenants on the landing . She tried to cross her arms , then let them drop heavily to her sides . " Yeah , " she said . " Betty 's my name . " <p> " We received your 911 call about an hour ago reporting that you were being held captive , against your will . You want to explain , Miss Savage ? " <p> Gail paused , then chuckled , a sound Hector had never heard her make before . " Man oh man . That must 've been my niece , Lopey . She 's eleven , a real wisecracker . Always playing pranks . Yeah , must 've been Lopey . Cuz as you can see , I 'm free as a jaybird , not captive at all , or whatever you call it . " <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I 'm gon na need to see some identification , ma'am . " <p> " Oh , just a sec . It 's in my purse . " <p> When she opened the door to slip inside the apartment , the smell wafted out . One of the cops coughed and covered his mouth . " What the hell is that smell ? " <p> Freddie shrugged . " Kennel . We 're dog breeders . Poodles and pits . AKC approved . I 'll be cleanin ' the cages tomorrow . " <p> Gail emerged again , and all three men held their hands clamped over their noses and mouths as she opened the door . She handed one of the cops an ID , and he examined it for a moment . <p> " This license is expired , Ms. Savage . It 's five years old . " <p> " I know . I ca n't drive anymore . Sciatica . " <p> The cop handed it back to her . " All right , all right . Tell your niece that it 's against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not funny , either . She could go to juvie for that . I mean , we 've got better things to do than pay a house visit for a emergency that does n't exist . " <p> " Oh , do n't worry , officer . My sister , Gail ? She 'll give that child the ass whoopin ' of her life . " <p> The cop paused , seeming not to know how to respond to this , then finally just nodded and adjusted his belt . " Let 's get out of here , Ron . " <p> When the cops were off the property , Gail looked up at the row of onlookers and shouted , " Lookie loo ! " The tenants exchanged confused looks . " That 's English for mind your own fuckin ' business . " <p> They all shuffled back to their respective apartments . Hector moved out of view , but hesitated on the landing outside his door for a moment , listening to Gail 's voice float up to him . She was speaking to Freddie . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words " shit-caked " and " ca n't budge " and " Stouffer 's . " Freddie whispered something in reply- " wipe her " or " diaper " - then they both disappeared inside the apartment . <p> After that , Hector was not able to fall asleep . He just lay there , with Ruby curled into a ball of warmth at his side , staring up at the piss-colored stain on the ceiling . In the distance , faintly , he could hear voices singing " This Little Light of Mine , " in the barn house next door . <p> Hector got the job . Everybody who showed up for the interview got the job . There were eight of them in total . Most looked younger than Hector , college students who came clutching the ad ripped from the paper , snapping their gum , and hungry for summer loot . Their leader was a bold white woman named Gretchen who wore a cherry-red blazer and matching skirt , sturdy black pumps as she paced the high school gymnasium , explaining their task . A van would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would split up and go door-to-door . Canvassing , Hector understood by the end of her spiel , was to go door-to-door asking for money . They were given scripts to rehearse on the way there , that explained the nature of their cause . A local campaign for " consumer rights . " Gretchen said they would , at their peak , make as much as she did-up to five hundred dollars a day . But they had to learn to be persistent . And , she added , as they were all climbing into the van , their clipboards and nametags in hand , they would only start making commission after the first fifty dollars they earned . <p> The first woman spoke to him through the chain lock in the door . <p> " You here about the weeds ? " <p> She was young and brunette with golden skin and thin lips . She wore polyester slacks and held a baby on her hip . <p> Hector shook her head and launched into his speech . <p> " I 'm here to talk to you about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Oh , go fuck yourself . " <p> Five houses would not open their doors at all . They looked at him through their windows and did n't say , " Go fuck yourself , " they simply did n't respond to his knocks . <p> An American flag hung over the door of the sixth house . In the driveway sat an Oldsmobile sedan with a bumper sticker on it that said , " American by the Grace of God . " <p> Hector paused at the walkway , last night 's Betty Savage intrigue catching up with him in another wave of exhaustion . He turned to look back at the street from which he 'd come . It was getting dark out , but through the dimness , he saw one of the canvassers , Hilary , walking in long strides down the main thoroughfare , clipboard pressed to her chest . Each canvasser had been assigned a particular set of streets on the Xeroxed map as their territory . Hilary seemed to have somehow wandered into his . He wondered if she was making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he was scheduled to return to the van . Would the rest of the recruits show up at the van with hundreds of dollars in their pockets ? <p> He wanted to be back at the Loma Lodge with Ruby . He 'd given Freddie ten dollars to walk her twice today , and feed her this evening . He hoped Freddie had n't gotten drunk and forgotten . <p> He took a deep breath and started up the walkway toward the American flag . <p> A promising sign : The man actually opened the door-screen included-all the way and stood facing Hector head-on . He was a red-faced man with a thick neck and a napkin stuck into his collar like a bib . His stomach bulged into the space between them . Hector could smell spicy food in the background , and his stomach growled . Even the grease on the man 's lips looked tasty . <p> " Yes ? " the man said in a voice that was n't altogether unfriendly . <p> Hector forced a grin onto his face . <p> " Hi , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very important initiative , " Hector said . " I 'll only take a minute of your time . " <p> " What 's this all about ? " the man said , pulling his napkin out of his collar to wipe the grease off his lips . <p> " Have you ever wondered , when you went shopping , if you were getting the most for your money ? Have you ever thought maybe you did n't have enough information to choose between all the hundreds of brands on display ... " <p> Hector looked down at his notes , then up at the man 's face as he went on . The man was listening . He was really listening ! Hector could hear his own voice gaining confidence as he went on . " The fact of the matter is , Proposition 297 is all about making sure that the consumer has the information he or she needs to spend their dollars wisely . " <p> Hector had finished his initial spiel , and the door was still open . He grinned wider at the man . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were being kept in the dark about where your money goes ? " <p> The man nodded . " Yeah . " <p> It was going to be an actual conversation . Hector could engage with the material . <p> " In what way ? " <p> The man wore an odd smile . " Let me ask you something . You legal ? " <p> Hector 's face felt cold , like something that had been packed in snow . <p> " Yes . " <p> " Legal , my ass . You about as legal as the woman who scrubs my toilet . " <p> Hector shook his head . <p> The man leaned forward , licked his lips . " Figures , the only ones who would hire you are a bunch of commies . Prop 297 , my ass . Coming onto my property , spewing this socialist bullshit about consumer rights . " <p> " Sir , as I was saying , the money you spend- " <p> " Know somethin ' ? I used to get paid to shoot rubber bullets at the likes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the force . I got paid . That 's how much the government likes you . We used to take bets to see who could hit you square in the ass . " His face was redder , his speech faster . Sweat beads glistened on his forehead . There was something sexual in the way he ogled Hector . <p> Hector knew he should leave , give up on this customer , but he stood rigid before the man , unable to turn away . <p> " I got real bullets now , " the man said . " A twelve-gauge shotgun three feet from where I 'm standing , and I 'm not afraid to use it . One pull of the trigger , and your whole head would just shatter into a million pieces on my grass . Mexican brain juice . Best fertilizer there is . And let me tell you a little somethin ' about your new homeland . Nobody 's gon na doubt my story when I call the police to report a dead Mexican on my property . I 'll tell them you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your dead brain against my- " <p> Hector now began to back up slowly . <p> " Go back to the garbage dump you climbed out of and quit tryin ' to make money off my tax dollars , you lousy piece of ... " <p> As Hector was edging backwards down the steps , he saw a woman emerge from the bowels of the house . She was small and stout and Asian and spoke to the man in pidgin English . " Food get cold , Luss . You wan me put in oven- " <p> " Shut the fuck up , you stupid cunt , " the man boomed over his shoulder . " I 'm trying to teach this fool to stay off my property . " <p> The woman evaporated . <p> Hector made it to the sidewalk without tripping backwards . He could not remember when he 'd last blinked . The man was still babbling in the doorway . Hector saw something in the window to the man 's left move . A curtain had parted , and there , behind the glass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a crew cut and features that were decidedly Eurasian . The kid was sucking his thumb with one hand , held his other pressed against the glass . He was crying . <p> The man was in a rapture state now , waving his fist , his eyes rolled toward heaven . His words tumbled forth with a life of their own . " Come creeping like cockroaches into our country , ca n't speak a dime of English , poppin ' out babies like there was no tomorrow- " <p> Hector spun around and jogged through the darkness , toward the main road at the end of the cul de sac . He did n't stop running for a long time , and when he did , it was as if he 'd run in place , the cul de sac before him was so similar to the other one . A row of beige ranch houses . He stood at its entrance , breathing deeply in an effort to calm himself down . There were no stores or gas stations around . Nowhere to sit and get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so clean compared to Puerto Morelos , which he missed suddenly with a fierceness that surprised him . He missed Guadalupe , the girl at the local store with her tiny extra thumb . He missed Jos Tecada , the unofficial mayor of Puerto Morelos , who had fathered at least three children by three married women . Only their husbands believed the kids were their own . He missed his mother , too , whose quicksand love he 'd wanted so badly to escape . A good son would have taken over the restaurant and married a local girl and given her grandchildren to make her smile . His mother said Tony was the cause of her son 's demise , and maybe she was right . It was Tony who put the idea in his head . " Be brave , my good man . The trick of life is to not get stuck . You 're young , able-bodied , childless , free . You can go anywhere . " <p> And now what had he to show for his bravery ? A day of work for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to laugh . He started back to the bus depot where the van would pick them up . He shivered , cold without a jacket . The temperature had dropped . California nights were cold in a way he had not expected . <p> Something was not right . Hector knew it as soon as he pulled into the parking lot of the Loma Lodge . He saw Freddie 's face-small , pale , and worried-peek out the window at him , then disappear behind a curtain . Hector saw his own apartment door upstairs was shut , and the lights , far as he could see , were all off . He 'd asked Freddie to turn on the lights for Ruby after he walked and fed her . He 'd forgotten . If Ruby had n't been walked or fed all day , eleven hours locked in the apartment- Hector could n't even entertain such a thought . Rage congealed in his throat as he made his way up the metal staircase . Two children who lived a few doors down were playing tiddlywinks in the dark outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of them whispered something to the other . He heard the word perro . <p> Outside his door , he shook his keys loudly , waiting to hear her ecstatic whining on the other side . Silence . He opened the door and stared into the darkness . Flicked on the light . Empty . A hopeful thought crossed his mind . Perhaps Freddie had taken her downstairs to play with the new litter of pit-bull puppies . Yes . That had to be it . <p> " She ran away . " <p> Hector turned to see Freddie was standing at the top of the stairwell all alone . He wore a white tank and was twisting the fat on his upper arm . <p> " Sorry , man . I opened the door , and I walked her like I said I would . I brought her to the beach and threw a ball for her , and we was having fun , so when I got back , I decided to let her play in the backyard with some of the poodles , cuz I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I let her off the leash for a minute , and then I let the poodles out of their cage and- " He raked a hand over his crew cut . He looked so scared Hector almost felt sorry for him . " And I do n't know what happened . The poodles just went crazy . They started attacking her , and I could n't get them to stop . She was so much bigger , but there were more of them , and man , it was like they had rabies . Finally I sprayed a hose on them , and Ruby took off , tail between her legs . " He gestured his arm toward the main road . " She went over there someplace , through them brambles to the swamp on the other side . I looked for her for a while , you can even ask my mom . I was out there , calling her name , but it was too dark , and I had to go the bathroom , so I just came home and waited for you . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the sound of his own voice . He wondered if it had always sounded this wayso hoarse and sad and tired . Or had the change taken place right now , tonight ? <p> " About an hour ago . " <p> From down below , in the courtyard , he heard Gail 's voice . " Didja tell him , Freddie ? " She was staring up at them in her housedress , hands on her hips . <p> " Yeah , Ma . I just told him . " <p> She shook her head . " I do n't know what got into the poodles . I think Ricky started it . He 's still got his gonads on . Makes him crazy . " <p> " Okay , " Hector said , because that was all he could muster . " Good night . " <p> " I feel real bad , " Freddie said , stepping forward , a hand outstretched . " Here 's your ten bucks . " <p> Hector began to shake his head no , because Freddie had done what he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money back . He could n't afford generosity at the moment . He was broke . He 'd worked all day and had nothing to show for it . <p> Inside , Hector sat in the dark on the edge of his mattress , his face in his hands , trying to fend off some shrieking panic that was rising inside of him . He did n't know if it was about Ruby or the canvassing or something more general . It was a loose , jangly feeling , like he might split apart into pieces at any moment , literally just fall apart there on the bed like failed machinery . <p> He came out of his apartment a few minutes later and saw Freddie and Gail were still outside , sitting on Freddie 's stoop , smoking and talking . They looked up at him as he came down the stairs , their faces drawn and worried . <p> " You okay ? " Gail called out . <p> Their concern surprised him , but then again , this was a tragedy they understood . Dog people were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends . <p> He told them he was going to search for Ruby across the street . In his hand he held her extra leash and in his pocket , liver treats . <p> " Freddie , go help him out , " Gail said . " This is your fuckin ' fault . " <p> Freddie lifted himself off the stoop , brushed some dirt off his behind . " You want me to come ? " <p> Hector backed up , shaking his head . " No , no . Thanks . " <p> He heard Gail saying to Freddie as he walked away , " If it was my dog ? I'da blown your brains out by now . " <p> Out in the sagebrush , Hector put his fingers to his lips and blew . It was their whistle . It sounded like no other . He 'd trained Ruby to come to it when she was just a puppy . He remembered those training sessions . He 'd tell her to stay , and she would sit at the far end of the beach and watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry , her body taut with the desire to follow . And when he got far enough away , he would turn and whistle , and she would spring up like a jack-in-a-box , and race , Speedy Gonzalez fast , toward him across the sand . Later , in crowds , he was able to walk her without a leash . If he lost sight of her , he simply whistled , and there she would be , within seconds , at his side . <p> The sky was black , a contrite nothingness . Cars whipped past every five seconds or so , the shush of their tires against asphalt . He saw , across the street , the lights of the crooked house . The bald-headed people were emerging from the barn doors now , and he could see more clearly from this angle than he could in the Loma Lodge . He could see them carrying two-by-fours and hammers . They were singing , " You 've got a friend in Jesus . " They were all different races , a black boy and a young white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Mexicana . It was an unusual formation . In los Estados Unidos , he 'd noticed that people tended to gravitate toward those who resembled them the most . Everybody wanted a tribe of mirror images . But this group was different . There was no pattern he could discern . He whistled again for Ruby . This time there was a sound-a crackle in the branches . He turned , squinting into the darkness . Ruby 's eyes glinted back at him . She crouched only five feet away , half-hidden in the branches , not moving . She watched him as if he were a stranger . He whispered her name . Why was she staring at him that way ? Why was n't she moving ? How had he changed into somebody else so fast ? <p> He was afraid of her . <p> And he was afraid of the fact that he was afraid of her . <p> And he was afraid of the fact that she was afraid of him . <p> Across the street the sound of singing reached him . You 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were so certain , hopeful , yet the voices behind those words were bewildered , lost . The creature moved , and he saw it was not Ruby after all , but a coyote , her feral ancient cousin . He watched it slink away . <p> Hector opened his eyes the next morning to the sight of a filthy and frayed tennis ball lying on the floor beside his mattress . Grief stuck to his tongue . He rolled over , but on that side of the bed , too , was a reminder-her faceless Squeaky doll . <p> The good news . Gail had reminded him last night when he got home that Ruby was wearing a nametag when she disappeareda fact he had Gail to thank for . In his first week at the Loma Lodge , she had encouraged him to order an identification tag for Ruby . She said every God-fearin ' American dog wore one of these . She had extra order forms for I-SOO-PET-TAGG downstairs , and he 'd filled one out and mailed it with four dollars in cash wrapped in a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received the thin metal disc in the mail . Her name , Ruby , was spelled right , but they 'd fudged the address line . Instead of Loma Lodge , San Diego , it read , LOMO LOGG , SANDY EGGO . He 'd considered sending it back , but they 'd printed the phone number right-the number of the public pay phone downstairs beside a vending machine . It rang so loudly that you could hear it from the second floor . All the Mexicans who lived there lined up in front of it on Sundays to call home with their little plastic international phone cards . Everyone but him . <p> Tony said winners do n't look over their shoulders to see what they left behind . <p> He got up and pulled on his jeans . Each morning he drove to the gas station for coffee and a cinnabun-or if he was especially hungry , a frozen breakfast burrito warmed in their microwave . The trick was to eat breakfast for under three dollars . He 'd figured he could live on his savings for another three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the extra long talons was working . She grinned when she saw him . <p> " Hey , Macho Camacho , " she said . " How it shakin ' this morning ? " <p> He poured his coffee . It was Caf Select . Quality stuff for a gas station . <p> " Shitty , " he told her . That was his newest vocabulary word . He 'd picked it up from Freddie . " I lost my dog . Last night . She ran away . " <p> " No sir . " <p> He did n't know why she 'd called him sir , but he responded in kind . " Yes , sir . " <p> He carried the cinnabun with his coffee to the register . <p> " You mean that cute little brown bitch I always saw you with ? " She was staring at him with such pity he felt a sob rising to his throat . <p> He clenched his teeth . " Yeah , Ruby . " <p> She sighed and began to ring up his purchases . He watched-the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to touch the cash register buttons with those six-inch claws in the way . <p> Outside , he stood taking sips of his coffee as he watched the commuters coming and going . They were white and thin-lipped and puffy-eyed . They were going to office jobs . He could smell their perfume and cologne wafting over to him , mingling with the smell of gasoline . Beyond them , across the street , stood a cluster of brown men , stocky , mostly indios , waiting for somebody to slow down and hire them for day labor . A few of those men lived in the Loma Lodge . During his first week , they 'd invited him to come along to the work pit-claiming that he could get a good construction job if he was lucky . But he 'd remembered Tony 's words : " If you start at the bottom you 'll stay at the bottom . Whatever you do , do n't get lumped in with the riffraff . It 'll break your spirit , and you 'll start to act like a slave , look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , Hector , if humanly possible . " <p> On his way back to the Lodge , he saw two girls in the distance . They were walking in single file along the side of the main road . They were from the house next door . He could tell because they were dressed in all white and had shaved heads . They were carrying grocery bags as they trudged along the embankment . He could hear their singing as he cruised up beside them . They turned to smile at him as he rolled by . <p> The thought came to him in the next instance : Maybe they knew something about Ruby . He was about to pass their driveway , and he pulled in abruptly with a sound of skidding . They were still a few minutes away , and he waited for them by his truck , arms folded , a flutter in his belly as he looked at the house up close . The school bus was gone , which meant the others had gone out together . He was glad for that . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . A smell wafted from it , too , something pungent and bitter and unpleasant . He could hear the girls ' voices growing closer , louder . Look what the Lord has done . Look what the Lord has done . He healed my body . He touched my mind . He saved me just in time . Look what the Lord has done . <p> They rounded the bend into the driveway , and they were smiling widely , cocktail-waitress smiles . One of them was black , dark-skinned , small , the other tall , a mestiza of some sort , but their expressions were identical . I 'm gon na praise His name . Each day is just the same . Come on and praise Him . Look what the Lord has done-Their voices faded , and the song dribbled off . <p> The black girl came toward him first , bright open grin , a hand outstretched . " Hello ! What can we do for you ? " <p> He swallowed , took a step back . This smile was not a grin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my dog . She 's lost . Have you seen her ? Brown , medium sized- " <p> The black girl laughed . " Hey , slow down . What 's your name ? " <p> " Hector . " He shrugged . " I live next door . In the Loma Lodge . The dog ran off a few nights ago , and I ca n't find her nowhere . " <p> In the same instant , the girls ' smiles did n't so much fade as they did turn upside down into frowns . <p> " How terrible . We were just talking about animals and how close to God they are . " <p> " And you want to hear something really strange ? I could sense sadness coming off of you . When your truck passed us on the road just now , I turned to Nina here and said , ' That man is grieving . ' Did n't I , Nina ? " <p> Nina nodded . " She did . She said it . " <p> " We knew you were sad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen her . " He held out her picture . " This here is her . This here is my dog . Ruby . " <p> " Ruby . She 's lovely . Sweet . " The mestiza girl said it like she actually meant it , fingering the picture , touching the dog 's face . <p> " So anyway , if you do see her , will you let me know ? Like I said , I live next door . Just come find me in Apartment Six . " <p> " Hey , Hector , can I ask you a question ? " <p> The black girl said the name like they 'd known each other for years , and it gave him a nice feeling . He realized nobody had said his name like that in a long time . <p> " Sure . " <p> " Do you pray ? " <p> Hector shrugged . " When I went to church , yeah , sure . " <p> They were smiling again , cocktail waitresses returned . " Oh , great . So you do pray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , when I went to church . " <p> " Where did you go to church ? " <p> " Mexico . With my family . Catholic church . " <p> " Oh , really . That 's so cool . " <p> " Mexico . Awesome . " <p> " We 'd love to pray for Ruby with you sometime . It works . It really does . " <p> " Oh , " Hector said , backing up . " Right . I mean , no , thanks . But if you can just let me know if you see her , that would be enough . " <p> " I understand . We 'll pray for her ourselves ! We 'll do it tonight ! How does that sound ? " <p> " Great . " He was at his truck door now . He wanted to get back to the Loma Lodge . <p> Hector paused outside his apartment door , jingling his keys , hoping to hear the sound of Ruby 's clicking nails on the floor coming to greet him . But there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found the apartment was empty . From the backyard , he heard the yap of teacup poodles demanding their dinner . He recalled holding Reggie one day for Gail while she was fiddling with her keys . She just handed the creature to him and said , " Here . " The dog 's legs had felt like the tiniest of twigs beneath its fur and skin . How easily they would snap if he were to twist them in just the right way . <p> In the dream , he was walking through the town square in Puerto Morelos . It was night . He was calling Ruby 's name . She was lost somewhere out there in the shadows . He walked , whistling , cooing , beckoning her back to him . Every shadow made his hopes leap , then crash when he saw it was n't her . Then the whole town was out in the square . Tony and Rigoberta and their three children . His mother and his brothers and his sister and his father , who had somehow come back to life . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extra thumbs , the boy with the rubbery limbs . They were all out there celebrating something in the dark , waving twizzler sticks , and yet they did n't see him . He was a ghost to them . Then the people faded into blackness , and he was alone , not in the square , but on a stretch of sand in Sandy Eggo , and there was nothing but the black sky above . He called Ruby 's name one last time , and then he saw something in the water , her little brown face doggedly moving toward shore . Clambering out of the waves . Shaking the water from her body and racing toward him up the sand , her leash dragging behind her . He squatted down , and then she was upon him , covering his face with wet licks . His thought : This is motherhood . I am mother now . His face was wet when he woke , like in the dream , but he was all alone . <p> The mattress still smelled of Hermaline , of dried semen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking of the town he 'd left behind and how maybe you had to leave a place to see it clearly . It was an odd paradox , one he 'd heard of before : the farther you move from Mexico , the more Mexican you become . He 'd spent his whole youth dreaming of los Estados Unidos , and now that he was here , he was dreaming of Puerto Morales . From the window came the sound of chanting , his neighbors , garbled words that were neither Spanish nor English , something tangled and new . He listened , trying to make meaning , until finally he fell into a strange trance , like a dog , half-asleep and half-stirring , eyes slit open to the dark . <p> Author Affiliation
