<p> Just a stone 's throw from the old Imperial Sugar mill lies an old piece of land with a new name . <p> On Feb. 18 , Sugar Land City Council approved the Belknap-Brookside Civic Association 's request to change the name of Venice greenbelt , a narrow plot of land along Oyster Creek , to Thomas L. James Park . The name , Thomas Leroy James , is unfamiliar to most of the city 's newcomers . But to those who remember James , the name brings back memories of a man whose care and vision for the people of Sugar Land helped set the little-known company town on a course for success . <p> James knew much about success . By his 40th birthday in 1947 , he was managing Sugarland Industries , a powerful but largely forgotten corporation that was once Imperial Sugars ' sister company . While Imperial refined sugar , Industries oversaw everything else in town , including the bank , hospital , canal company and truck lines . From 1947 until Industries dissolved in 1972 , each manager of Industries ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influential in the community , James seemed an unlikely leader ; he dreaded public speaking . <p> " He was basically a shy person , " said his daughter , Jackie James . " His demeanor did n't fit the job descriptions that he had . " <p> And his job descriptions were numerous : President and director of Sugar Land Telephone Co. , president and director of Belknap Realty Co. , and chairman of the board and trustee of Eldridge Memorial Hospital , to name a few . <p> Though lacking the charisma often found in movers and shakers , Tom James , as the locals call him , had a big heart . <p> Jackie tells the story of an Imperial Sugar employee who her father helped years ago . The employee wished to buy land where he wanted to build a house . When the local bank would not approve a loan for the worker , James stepped in and co-signed the note . The worker got his land , and , consequently , was able to stay in Sugar Land . <p> Still living in the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James , also a Sugar Land resident , if he might mow her lawn . She consented , but soon discovered that he would accept no pay for his services . James recalled his explanation , " Your dad did me a favor , and I was never able to pay him back . So I want to mow your yard for you . " <p> Jackie James said she often hears praise for her parents . <p> " I hear that all the time , how wonderful my dad and my mom were , and that they were just so good and caring , " she said . <p> Thomas James did not always live in Sugar Land . He was born in 1907 , in Montgomery , Ala . He graduated from high school in May 1924 and went on to graduate from Draughans Business College , Montgomery , just three months later . <p> In May 1929 , James , a soft-spoken young man with black hair and blue eyes , married Miriam Ada Harper . Soon after their marriage , the couple moved to New Orleans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While in New Orleans , a family friend informed James that a company in Sugar Land , was looking for smart , young men to hire . Later in a letter , that same friend made quite a statement . He predicted that if James learned all that he could about both the company and the community and that if he and Miriam did not grow too homesick , James would one day become president of that company . <p> After having lived in New Orleans for five months , James decided to move his family to Sugar Land . He and Miriam arrived in the company town in August 1929 . At the time , Sugar Land had miles of farmland , some dirt roads and a small community of workers . Without so much as an interview , the 21-year-old James went to work as a stenographer for Sugarland Industries . <p> Two months later , the stock market crashed . Even Sugar Land felt the effects . <p> During those fitful times , James apparently caught the attention of both Isaac H. Kempner Sr. and William T. Eldridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sugarland Industries . James increasingly was given more responsibility within the company until he eventually became an executive officer . <p> " He was very trustworthy , " Jackie explained . " He apparently had some smarts , too . " <p> Midway through the Depression , James was hit with a pay cut and began considering other job offers . But by that time , Kempner and Eldridge viewed James as a valuable asset . Hence , James ' needs were met , and he stayed with Industries . <p> In 1939 , Miriam , having miscarried six times , gave birth to the Jameses ' only child , Martha Jacqueline James , or " Jackie . " <p> On the day she was born , James started a diary . He kept it for 36 years . In the diary , James briefly jotted down thoughts about his family , mentioning nothing about the Depression , World War II , or other events . <p> " It was just about what was happening with us , " Jackie said . " I think that speaks considerably about a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during Jackie 's childhood , James rode horses with her every Saturday morning , and when she went off to college , he sent his daughter a one- to two-page typed letter every day of the week . <p> " He was always there for me , " Jackie said . <p> And that is how James wanted it . Spending time with his family was a priority . Rather than eating at the office , he typically ate lunch with his wife and daughter around their kitchen table , and " if he was not home by 5:15 in the evening , we 'd start worrying , " James said . " He did his work , but then he was home . He believed in family . " <p> He also believed in attending church every Sunday . " Their church was really the center of their lives , " James said . <p> The Jameses were involved actively in First Presbyterian Church of Sugar Land . James served as a deacon , elder and trustee , and his wife taught the high school boys Sunday School class . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager of Industries and was given charge over the daily operations of the company , a charge that he kept until the day he retired 25 years later . In the meantime , he was elected executive vice president in 1953 , and in 1957 , just as his friend in New Orleans had predicted , James was made president and director of the company . <p> Though an important person in town , James never strutted , say those who remember him . <p> " A lot of the old Imperial workers , a lot of the old Industries workers are still here , and they remember Tom James very fondly , " said J.M. Chernosky , a Sugar Land native and the president of the Belknap-Brookside Civic Association . <p> Chernosky 's mother , Mary , used to work under James at what is now Frost Bank . She tells the story of how James would stroll into the bank , and though chairman of the board , he would sit down with the tellers in a backroom and sip coffee with them as they swapped stories . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Chernosky , who is the area 's unofficial expert on Tom James . <p> Not wanting " oldtimers " such as James to be forgotten , Chernosky has spearheaded an effort to honor such individuals . The organization through which he hopes to keep their memories alive is the Beautification and Historical Committee of the Belknap-Brookside Civic Association . The committee has as its goals : Beautifying , preserving the history of and increasing property values in old Sugar Land . <p> The rededication will occur sometime in the first part of 2004 . The city of Sugar Land and the association will plan the event . It will be open to the public with a special emphasis placed on the James family and former workers of Sugar Land Industries , all subsidiaries and Cullen Bank . <p> Chernosky hopes the renaming of James Park will be the first in a string of renamings . <p> As the nine committee members considered individuals for whom they would want to name a park , they looked for a person who had both local , historical significance as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said Chernosky . Plus , he had something else . <p> " He had vision , " Chernosky said , " before we knew what vision was . " <p> James ' vision was for the prosperity of Sugar Land . Under his leadership , the Southwest Freeway was brought into Sugar Land ; the Belknap , Brookside and Venetian Estates neighborhoods were developed , and drainage was improved in Sugar Land , a naturally swampy area . Also under James ' management , the workers in Sugar Land received some of the best benefits to be had , Chernosky said . <p> James ' vision for Sugar Land , said Chernosky , " started with taking care of the people in the town . " <p> In 1972 , at age 65 , James retired from Sugarland Industries , which was shutting down operations . <p> He still remained involved in the community , most notably as chairman of the board and later chairman of the board emeritus at what is now Frost Bank . <p> On June 30 , 1988 , James died of natural causes at age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had come to pay respects to a man who had captured their hearts , won their respect , and in the process , helped transform Sugar Land from a small company town to a booming city . <p> Yet , amid the hustle and bustle of modern-day Sugar Land , James Park remains a still , quiet place . Hidden in the Belknap-Brookside neighborhood , four park benches and a collection of picturesque trees accent the park 's slender stretch of grass along Oyster Creek . <p> Decorative lights are scheduled to be installed by the end of July . If a capital improvements proposal clears the city 's Parks and Recreation Department and then City Council , James Park will receive various improvements , including a walking path , an open-air boardwalk , an etched stone sign and a historical marker that will highlight James ' life and legacy . <p> Chernosky said that the Belknap-Brookside community is " very happy " about the James Park renaming . <p> " This park is very intimate , " said Chernosky , " it 's a very old piece of land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived by .
