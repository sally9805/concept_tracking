Technology Workplace , Management , and Institutional Trends Photograph // INTRODUCTION The impacts of new technological breakthroughs-and their unexpected consequences-continue to play a major role in shaping the way we work and manage our institutions , according to Marvin J. Cetron. president of Forecasting International Ltd. , and science writer Owen Davies . For some four decades , Forecasting International has conducted an ongoing study of the forces changing our world . Forecasts stemming from these trends range from the very near term ( 2005-2010 ) to medium-range futures ( up to 2050 ) , but the authors make no attempt to speculate on very-long-range futures that may prove of little practical use . Whatever your concern , some of these trends will have a very direct impact upon it . Others will help to form the general environment in which we live and work . They all merit attention from anyone who must prepare for what lies ahead . The authors-and the World Future Society-welcome your feedback . * Technology increasingly dominates both the economy and society . * New technologies are surpassing the previous state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accelerating . * Computers are fast becoming part of our environment , rather than just tools we use for specific tasks . With wireless modems , portable computers give us access to networked data wherever we go . * Robots are taking over more and more jobs that are routine , remote , or risky , such as repairing undersea cables or space-station components . Flexible , general-service personal robots will appear in the home by 2010 , expanding on the capabilities of devices such as robotic vacuum cleaners and lawn mowers . * Wireless connections simplify relocation of personnel , minimize delays in completing new installations , and let terminals travel with the user instead of forcing the user to seek out the terminal . * By 2010 , artificial intelligence , data mining , and virtual reality will help most companies and government agencies to assimilate data and solve problems beyond the range of today 's computers . AI applications include robotics , machine vision , voice recognition , speech synthesis , electronic data processing , health and human services , administration , and airline pilot assistance . * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use soon after 2015 . Implications : New technologies should continue to improve the efficiency of many industries , helping to keep costs under control . However , this increased productivity retarded U.S. job creation from 2002 through early 2004 . Other developed countries are likely to feel the same effect in the future . New technologies often require a higher level of education and training to use them effectively . They also provide dozens of new opportunities to create businesses and jobs . Automation will continue to cut the cost of many services and products , making it possible to reduce prices while still improving profits . This will be critical to business survival as the Internet continues to push the price of many products to the commodity level . Photograph Computers are fast becoming part of our environment and dominating the economy and society in the process . // New technology also will make it easier for industry to minimize and capture its effluent . This will be a crucial ability in the environmentally conscious future . * Research and development will play a growing role in the economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown steadily in the past three decades . Projected R &D; spending in fiscal year 2005 represents 1.1% of GDP , the same proportion as in 1990 but greater than in 2000 ( 0.7% ) . * R &D; outlays in Japan have risen almost continuously , to nearly 3% of GDP . * China has taken third place in the world 's R &D; spending , with a budget totaling about $60 billion in 2001 , the most recent year for which the figure is available . The United States spent $282 billion on research that year , while Japan spent $104 billion . Germany , in fourth place , spent $54 billion . * R &D; spending in the European Union is just under 2% of GDP . In individual countries , it ranges from 4.27% of GDP in Sweden to just 1.8% in Britain , where it has declined steadily for more than 10 years . * In Russia , R &D; budgets fell from about 2% of GDP in 1990 to under 1% in 1997 ; they are believed to have recovered to about 1.1% by 2003 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important impacts on the global economy . // * In the United States , federal funding for basic research has dwindled , as Washington focuses on military research and engineering . * Corporate R &D; in the United States also has shifted in the post-September 11 period , with less emphasis on pharmaceuticals and computer-related fields and more focus on biotechnology , nanotechnology , and security technologies . * Western corporations are beginning to outsource R &D; to foreign contractors , just as they do other functions . Russian laboratories , which are technologically sophisticated but have been hard-pressed to survive budget cuts for more than a decade , are taking on much of this work . * U.S. jobs created by high-tech exports are more than replacing the low-tech jobs lost to competition under the North American Free Trade Agreement and similar agreements . Implications : The demand for scientists , engineers , and technicians will continue to grow , particularly in fields where research promises an immediate business payoff . Low-wage countries such as China will continue to take jobs from advanced industrialized countries such as the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in technology and service industries . Countries like India , China , and Russia may continue to suffer a brain drain as those with high-tech skills emigrate to high-demand , high-wage destinations . However , there is evidence that growing numbers of technology students and professionals are spending time in the West to learn cutting-edge skills , and then returning to their native lands to work , start companies , and teach . This trend may promote the growth of some developing countries while reducing the competitive advantages of the developed world . By inhibiting stem-cell research , the United States has made itself a less attractive place for cutting-edge biomedical scientists . The United Kingdom is capitalizing on this to become the world 's leader in stemcell research . In the process , it is reversing the brain drain that once deprived it of top scientists . Washington 's neglect of basic science is being felt in the declining fraction of patents , Nobel Prizes , and other awards going to American scientists . As other countries become more skilled in critical high-tech fields , the United States is fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it will begin to undermine the U.S. economy and shift both economic and political power to other lands . * Advances in transportation technology will make travel and shipping faster , cheaper , and safer , by land , sea , and air . * NASA 's X-43A Scramjet , an experimental hypersonic aircraft , successfully flew at 7,000 mph ( nearly 10 times the speed of sound ) in November 2004 . Once commercialized , such technology could whisk diplomats and other high-priority passengers across continents in less time than it takes most people to drive to the airport . * By 2010 , New York , Tokyo , and Frankfurt will emerge as transfer points for passengers of high-speed , large-capacity supersonic planes . * Airline crashes will decline , and will involve fewer fatalities , thanks to such technical advances as safer seat design and flash-resistant fuels . * Following European practice , the U.S. airline industry will begin to replace the spokes of its existing hub-and-spokes system with high-speed trains for journeys of 100 to 150 miles . Photograph NASA 's X-43A Scramjet breaks speed record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farther than ever . // * Advances in automobile technology such as road-condition sensors , continuously variable transmissions , automated traffic management systems , night-vision systems , and smart seats that tailor airbag inflation to the passenger 's weight will all be in common use by 2010. * The first commercial hybrid gaselectric cars are available already . New models will begin to win market share from traditional gas guzzlers between 2005 and 2010. * To reduce the number and severity of traffic accidents , trucks on the most heavily used highways will be exiled to car-free lanes , and the separation will be enforced . Implications : One of the fastest-growing transport industries is trucking , in part because computers encourage just-in-time inventory management . Deliveries for Internet-based companies are an expanding market for shipping . This field will grow more efficient as GPS-based truck tracking and other new technologies spread through the industry . More-efficient vehicles , especially with hybrid power trains , should begin to reduce the demand for oil by 2008 , easing one of the few remaining sources of inflation . By 2010 , smart-car technologies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe and , slightly later , the United States . Cities increasingly will struggle to reduce auto congestion , either by limiting the use of private automobiles-as in Munich , Vienna , and Mexico City-or by encouraging the development and use of mass transit , as in Copenhagen and Curitiba , Brazil . Technology may offer other alternatives . One proposal is " dualmode transportation , " in which private cars would be used normally on short hauls but would run on automated guideways for long-distance travel . * The pace of technological change accelerates with each new generation of discoveries and applications . * The design and marketing cycle-idea , invention , innovation , imitation-is shrinking steadily . Thus , products must capture their market quickly , before the competition can copy them . As late as the 1940s , the product cycle stretched to 30 or 40 years . Today , it seldom lasts that long . * Computer-aided design in the automobile and other industries shortens the lag time between idea and finished design . * Eighty percent of the scientists , engineers , and doctors who ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Internet. * All the technical knowledge we work with today will represent only 1% of the knowledge that will be available in 2050 . Implications : Industries will face much tighter competition based on new technologies . Those who adopt state-of-the-art methods first will prosper . Those who ignore them eventually will fail . Lifelong learning is a necessity for anyone who works in a technical field-and for growing numbers who do not . * Important medical advances will continue to appear almost daily . * Genetic research has accelerated advances in medicine and in the growth of medical knowledge . Early results stemming from the Human Genome Project include possible cures for hemophilia , cystic fibrosis , familial hypercholesterolemia , a number of cancers , and AIDS . Eventually , some 4,000 hereditary disorders may be prevented or cured through genetic intervention . Photograph Medical advances will continue emerging almost daily thanks to genetic research and assistance from computer modeling . // * Our growing knowledge of biochemistry , aided by advanced computer modeling , has made it possible to design drugs to fit specific receptors in the cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective than natural derivatives . * New research on artificial blood shows promise for stretching the supply of blood , which is expected to fall short of demand by 4 million units per year for the next 30 years . * Memory-enhancing drugs should reach clinical use by 2010. * " Magic bullet " drug-delivery systems will make it possible to direct enormous doses of medication exactly where they are needed , sparing the rest of the body from possible side effects . This will improve therapeutic results in cancers and many other conditions that require the use of powerful drugs . * Brain-cell and nerve-tissue transplants to aid victims of retardation , head trauma , and other neurological disorders will enter clinical use by 2007 . Heart repairs using muscles from other parts of the body will arrive soon after . Transplanted animal organs will find their way into common use . Laboratory-grown bone , muscle , and blood cells also will be employed in transplants . * Other transplanted tissues will come from cloning and related technologies used to grow stem cells . Radical new treatments for diabetes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other disorders can be expected to arrive within the next five to 10 years . Forecasting International believes that cloning and related methods will be accepted for the treatment of disease . * Surgeons working via the Internet will routinely operate on patients in remote areas , using robot manipulators. * In the next 10 years , we expect to see more and better bionic limbs , hearts , and other organs ; drugs that prevent disease rather than merely treating symptoms ; and body monitors that warn of impending trouble . These all will reduce hospital stays . * By 2025 , the first nanotechnology-based medical therapies should reach clinical use . Microscopic machines will monitor our internal processes , remove cholesterol plaques from artery walls , and destroy cancer cells before they have a chance to form a tumor . Implications : Even without dramatic advances in life extension , baby boomers are likely to live much longer , and in better health , than anyone now expects . This will reduce the cost of health care well below most current projections , but is likely to raise dramatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few remaining fixed-benefit pension plans . High development and production costs for designer pharmaceuticals , computerized monitors , and artificial organs will continue to push up the cost of health care far more rapidly than the general inflation rate . Much of these expenses will be passed on to Medicare and other third-party payers . Severe personnel shortages can be expected in high-tech medical specialties , in addition to the continuing deficit of nurses . A growing movement to remove barriers to stem-cell research in the United States could speed progress in this critical field . This could be expected to produce new treatments for neurological disorders such as Parkinson 's and Alzheimer 's diseases and many other illnesses now incurable or untreatable. * The Internet is growing , both logarithmically and geographically . * In spring 2004 , Internet users numbered around 945 million worldwide , exceeding forecasts . * In the United States , more than 185 million people have Internet connections , while nearly 137 million are active users . * The world 's population of Internet users is expected to grow to 1.35 billion by 2007. * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Internet connectivity in some developing lands . India had only 170,000 Internet subscribers in 1998 ; by 2004 , it had 39 million , more than half again as many as had been predicted just two years earlier . Photograph The Internet is growing and connecting ever greater numbers of people-both to each other and to new sources of information . // * In late 2004 , China 's population of Internet users amounted to just under 100 million . * More than 80% of Japanese households were online by early 2003 . A year later , more than 78 million people-over 60% of Japan 's population-had access to the Internet via computers , cell phones , and other devices . * American consumers are finally adopting broadband . Some 8.3 million homes and businesses signed up for broadband service in 2003 , bringing the total to 28.2 million lines . By late 2004 , about 63 million people , some 51% of all home Internet users , had broadband at home . * Most Internet communication is commercial , business-to-business , rather than personal e-mail . * Internet-based commerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be about $2.7 trillion in 2004 , $1 trillion in the United States alone . Business-to-business sales passed $1 trillion by the end of 2003 . Online retail sales in the United States grew by 51% in 2003 and were expected to grow another 27% in 2004. * Not long ago , the Internet was predominately English-speaking . By 2004 , there were an estimated 280 million Internet users in countries where English is the dominant language , but 680 million in non-English-speaking countries . * Americans made up 42% of the total Internet-using population in 2000 , dropping to less than 20% in May 2004 . Implications : B2B sales on the Internet are dramatically reducing business expenses throughout the Internet-connected world , while giving suppliers access to customers they could never have reached by traditional means . Internet-based operations require more sophisticated , knowledgeable workers . People with the right technical training will find a ready market for their services for at least the next 15 years , as major businesses compete to hire them . However , the specialties required in any given country will change as some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social isolation has become almost impossible for countries interested in economic development . Even China 's attempts to filter the Internet and shield its population from outside influences have proved relatively ineffective , as hackers elsewhere provide ways to penetrate the barriers . However , isolationism is still possible for those who are not concerned with trade . The number of Internet users in Iran has fallen from an estimated 1 million to about 420,000 since the mullahs shut down the country 's cybercafes . Trends in Labor Force and Work * Education and training are expanding throughout society . * Approximately 130,000 additional K-12 teachers will be needed in the United States between 2000 and 2010 , according to the National Center for Educational Statistics . * Also needed : An annual $10 billion increase in federal spending for programs such as Head Start , aid for disadvantaged children , the Job Corps , and the Job Training Partnership Act . * Starting salaries for teachers ( as a ratio of per capita GDP ) declined throughout the 1990s in most countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zealand . * Knowledge turnover in the professions is a growing challenge that will require continuous retraining and lifelong learning . The half-life of an engineer 's knowledge today is only five years ; in 10 years , 90% of what an engineer knows will be available on the computer . In electronics , fully half of what a student learns as a freshman is obsolete by his senior year . * Rapid changes in the job market and work-related technologies will necessitate increased training for virtually every worker . * In the next 10 years , close to 10 million jobs will open up for professionals , executives , and technicians in the highly skilled service occupations . Photograph Education and training are expanding because workers need to keep up with a constantly growing knowledge base in their professions . // * A substantial portion of the labor force will be in job retraining programs at any moment . Much of this will be carried out by current employers , who have come to view employee training as a good investment . * Schools will train both children and adults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven hours for children ; adults will use much of their remaining free time to prepare for their next job . * We already are seeing a trend toward more adult education . One reason is the need to train for new careers as old ones are displaced or boomers grow bored with them . The other is the need of healthy , energetic people to keep active during retirement . * In the United States , education is moving rapidly to the Internet , as small , rural grammar and high schools supplement their curricula with material from larger institutions , while universities increasingly market their programs to distant students . Implications : Even small businesses must learn to see employee training as an investment rather than an expense . Motorola estimates that it reaps $30 in profits for each dollar it spends on training . Both management and employees must get used to the idea of lifelong learning . It will become a significant part of work life at all levels . As the digital divide is erased and minority and low-income households buy computers and log onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educate and train themselves for high-tech careers . * Specialization is spreading throughout industry and the professions . * For doctors , lawyers , engineers , and other professionals , the size of the body of knowledge required to excel in any one area precludes excellence across all areas . * The same principle applies to artisans . Witness the rise of post-and-beam homebuilders , old-house restorers , automobile electronics technicians , and mechanics trained to work on only one brand of car . * The information-based organization depends on its teams of task-focused specialists . * Globalization of the economy calls for the more independent specialists . For hundreds of tasks , corporations will turn to consultants and contractors who specialize more and more narrowly as markets globalize and technologies differentiate . Implications : This trend creates endless new niche markets to be served by small businesses . It also brings more career choices , as old specialties quickly become obsolete , but new ones appear even more rapidly . * Services are the fastest-growing sector of the global economy . * Retail sales in the United States grew by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Census Bureau , while revenues in selected service industries rose by 14.4% . Similar trends are seen in other industrialized countries . * Service industries accounted for 83% of private nonfarm employment in the United States in 2000 , the most recent year for which figures are available , up from only 70% in 1990 . In the decade ending 2010 , services are expected to account for virtually the entire net gain in U.S. employment . * Service jobs have replaced many of the well-paid positions lost in manufacturing , transportation , and agriculture . These new jobs , often part time , pay half the wages of manufacturing jobs . On the other hand , computer-related service jobs pay much more than the minimum-for workers with sound education and training . Photograph Jobs in service industries , including computer-related services , will see continued fast growth . // * Some of the fastest growth is in some of the least-skilled occupations , such as cashiers and retail salespersons . Implications : Services are now beginning to compete globally , just as manufacturing industries have done over the last 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrialized lands , this trend will help to keep inflation in check . The growth of international business will act as a stabilizing force in world affairs , as most countries find that conflict is unacceptably hard on the bottom line . * Women 's salaries are approaching equality with men's-but very slowly . * Internationally , women 's average hourly pay was 81.8% of men 's in 2004 , up from 80.6% in 2003. * Women 's salaries in the United States have been rising faster than men 's since 1975 . However , there still is a long way to go . Average earnings for a man employed full time and year-round reported in the 2000 Census was about $38,000 , or $10,000 more than for a woman working a comparable job . Female doctors make only 58% as much as their male colleagues . * In Great Britain , the gender pay gap narrowed to record levels in 2004 , as women 's wages reached 85.7% of men 's , according to U.K. National Statistics . Photograph Women are catching up to men in salary albeit at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasingly valuable to corporations , may find it easier to reach upper-management positions in the future . // * Women 's salaries have reached parity with men 's in only five fields , nearly all of them areas where women have broken into trades long dominated by men : hazardous material removal workers , telecommunications line installers and repairers , meeting and convention planners , dining room or cafeteria workers , and construction trade helpers . * However , women 's average income could exceed men 's within a generation . College graduates enjoy a significant advantage in earnings over peers whose education ended with high school . Today , some 64% of young American women enroll in college , compared with only 60% of young men . * To the extent that experience translates as prestige and corporate value , older women should find it easier to reach upper-management positions . This will blaze the trail and help raise the pay scale for women still climbing the corporate ladder . Implications : The fact that women 's salaries are lagging despite higher academic achievement than men suggests that many college-educated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , and they will expect both pay and opportunities equal to those of men . Competition for top executive positions , once effectively limited to men , will intensify even as the corporate ladder loses many of its rungs . The glass ceiling has been broken . One-fourth of upper executives today , and nearly 20% of corporate board members , are women . While this is still too few , it is far more than in any previous generation , and their numbers can only grow . Look for more women to reach decisionmaking levels in business and government . * Workers are retiring later as life expectancy stretches . * OECD data show that people are retiring earlier in the developed world , but this is only part of the picture . Americans , for instance , often return to work and delay complete retirement for several years . This trend will spread to other industrialized countries as the retirement-age population grows and the number of active workers to support them declines . * People increasingly will work at one career , " retire " for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , return to school , begin another career , and so on in endless variations . True retirement , a permanent end to work , will be delayed until very late in life . * By 2010 , we expect the average retirement age in the United States to be delayed well into the 70s . Benefits may also continue their decline , and they will be given based on need , rather than as an entitlement . Implications : Since the penalty on earnings of Social security recipients was rescinded , more American retirees will return to work , and those not yet retired will be more likely to remain on the job . Even though the Social Security program has been the " third rail " of American politics , within five years , the retirement age will be moved back at least to 70 for early retirement and full benefits at 72 . Older workers will partially make up for shortages of entry-level employees . The chance to remain in the workplace will reduce the risk of poverty for many elderly people who otherwise would have had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act as technical aides to teachers , especially in the sciences . In the long run , it may prove impossible to maintain the tradition of retirement , except through personal savings and investment . * Labor unions are losing their power to secure rights for workers and to shape public policy in regard to workplace issues . * Union membership has been falling for the past two decades . In the United States , unions enrolled 23% of employed wage and salary workers in 1980 , but only 13% by 2003 . Forecasting International projects further declines in the nearterm future , to below 12% , despite several recent successes in organizing , contract negotiations , and strikes . * Public-sector workers in the United States are more likely to be unionized than private-sector employees . Membership is high among workers in education ( 37.7% ) and protective services ( 36.1% ) . Sales and office occupations have the lowest union-membership rates ( 8.2% ) , according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) . * In South Korea , where organized labor once was invincible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , electrical workers , car makers , and other trade groups . * In Britain , where the Thatcher government broke union power in the 1980s , labor has yet to recover its former strength . Union membership has flattened out after falling steadily . Still , unions cover a higher proportion of British workers ( 26.6% ) than U.S. workers , according to the U.K. Labour Force Survey . * One reason for this decline is that companies are freely seeking and finding nonunionized workers around the world . They also contract out a growing proportion of business activities to nonunion firms . * Increased automation can cut a company 's workforce by up to one-third . The surviving workers tend to be technicians and other comparatively well-educated semiprofessionals , who always have tended to resist union membership . The growing industrial use of artificial intelligence will further this trend . Implications : For large companies , this trend promises greater stability in employee wages and benefits . Unions eager to regain their membership will target any substantial company with less-skilled employees to organize . This could raise labor costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to organize . In 10 to 15 years , American labor unions will compete with AARP to lead the battle for the rights of latelife workers and for secure retirement benefits . They face an inherent conflict between the interests of workers in what once would have been the retirement years and those of younger members , who rightly see the elderly as having saddled them with the cost of whatever benefits older generations enjoy . Unions ' political strength is also diminishing and is increasingly being surpassed by powerful blocs such as AARP , Hispanics , and African Americans . The old paradigm of unions vs. corporations is obsolete . In today 's economy , workers negotiate alongside management , winning shared bonuses . Photograph Careers in health-care professions will become popular among mid-life career switchers. // * Second and third careers are becoming common , as more people make midlife changes in occupation . * The fast pace of technological change makes old careers obsolete , even as new ones open up to replace them . * Americans born at the tail end of the baby boom ( 1956-1964 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 38 , according to BLS . These job jumpers continue to take short-duration jobs even as they approach middle age : 70% of jobs they took between ages 33 and 39 ended within five years . * Among these late boomers , college-educated women tended to hold the most jobs overall ( 11.1 ) between ages 18 and 38 , but their job jumping occurred primarily in their youth . By their middle 30s , they held on average just 2.2 jobs between the ages of 33 and 38 , compared with 2.5 jobs on average for all the late boomers , and 2.7 jobs for males with less than a bachelor 's degree . * Career changing may also be increasing , though BLS does not track the phenomenon since there is not a clear definition of what constitutes a " career change " - such as when a technician becomes a manager in the same company or industry . However , Forecasting International believes that people change careers every 10 years . // Job Hoppers in the United States Educated women are the most-frequent job hoppers in their youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * Boomers and their children will have not just two or three careers , but five or six , as dying industries are replaced by new opportunities . * In the United States , 23% of workers surveyed by the University of Phoenix in 2004 reported being dissatisfied with their careers and were considering a change of occupation . Of these , 61% expressed a desire " to do something more fulfilling , " such as entering a " helping profession . " * Seventy percent of Irish workers surveyed in 2004 said they hoped to make a career change in the near future , according to the recruitment Web site Irishjobs.ei . Women and individuals in the 26-35 age group were most likely to report the desire to change careers . " Personal fulfillment " was the biggest reason cited for making the change . Implications : " Earn while you learn " takes on new meaning : Most people will have to study for their next occupation , even as they pursue their current career . In many two-earner couples , one member or the other will often take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is becoming an increasingly attractive option , as being your own boss makes it easier to set aside time for career development . This is especially true for Gen X'ers and millennials . Retirement plans must be revised , so that workers can transfer medical and pension benefits from one career to the next-a change that has long been needed . * The work ethic is vanishing . * More than one-third of U.S. workers reported calling in sick when they were not ill at least once in the past 12 months , and 10% had done so at least three times , according to a 2004 survey by CareerBuilder.com. * Job security and high pay are not the motivators they once were , because social mobility is high and people seek job fulfillment . Some 48% of those responding in a recent Louis Harris poll said they work because it " gives a feeling of real accomplishment. " * Fifty-five percent of the top executives interviewed in the poll say that erosion of the work ethic will have a major negative effect on corporate performance in the future . * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WorldCom , Tyco International , Adelphia Cable , and ImClone just begin the list of companies under investigation for deceptive accounting practices , looting of corporate assets , and other misdeeds with dire implications for stock values . * Seeking the root of such problems , a Zogby International poll of college seniors found that 97% said their studies had prepared them to act ethically in the future . However , 73% said professors had taught them that right and wrong are not susceptible to uniform standards , but depend on individual values and cultural norms . Implications : The new generation of workers can not simply be hired and ignored . They must be nurtured , paid well , and made to feel appreciated . Training is crucial . Without the opportunity to learn new skills , young people will quickly find a job that will help them to prepare for the rest of their career . * Two-income couples are the norm , though the trend may be slowing or even reversing . * In the United States , both the husband and the wife worked in 50.9% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Survey . This proportion has declined since 1997 , when it was 53.4% . However , the proportion of married-couple families in which only the wife worked rose for the third straight year , to 6.8% , in 2003 . Photograph Two-income couples are becoming the norm , though the trend may have peaked . A more common scenario in the future will be for one partner to work while the other takes time off to retrain for a new career . // * The percentage of working-age women who are employed has grown steadily throughout the industrialized world . In the United States , it has grown from 46% in 1970 to 68.8% in 2000 . The lowest are Italy , Spain , and Mexico , with just 40% of working-age women employed , according to OECD figures . * This emphasis on work is one big reason the richest 25% to 50% of the U.S. population has reached zero population growth . They have no time for children and little interest in having large families . * The number of working mothers with young children is actually declining . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held jobs in 2002 , compared with 61% in 1997 . At the same time , the percentage of married working women with children under a year old fell from 59% to 53% . Implications : Demand for on-the-job child care , extended parental leave , and other family-oriented benefits can only grow . In the long run , this could erode the profitability of some companies , unless it is matched by an equal growth in productivity . Two-career couples can afford to eat out often , take frequent short vacations , and buy new cars and other such goods . And they feel they deserve whatever time-savers and outright luxuries they can afford . This is quickly expanding the market for consumer goods and services , travel , and leisure activities . This also promotes self-employment and entrepreneurialism , as one family member 's salary can tide them over while the other works to establish a new business . Look for families that usually have two incomes , but have frequent intervals in which one member takes a sabbatical or goes back to school to prepare for another career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will become the new norm . * Generation X and the millennials will have major effects in the future . * Members of generation X-roughly , the 30-plus cohort-and especially of the millennial generation , now in their 20s , have more in common with their peers throughout the world than with their parents ' generation . * There are approximately 50 million people in Europe between the ages of 15 and 24 ; 30 million more are between 25 and 29 . The under-30 cohort represents about 22% of the European population . * The under-20 cohort is remaining in school longer and taking longer to enter the workforce than before . * Generation X should be renamed " generation E , " for entrepreneurial . Throughout the world , they are starting new businesses at an unprecedented rate . * The younger millennial generation is proving to be even more business-oriented , caring for little but the bottom line . Twice as many say they would prefer to own a business rather than be a top executive . Five times more would prefer to own a business rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many in generation X are economically conservative . On average , those who can do so begin saving much earlier in life than their parents did in order to protect themselves against unexpected adversity . They made money in the stock market boom of the 1990s , then lost it in the " dot-bomb " contraction , but have left their money in the market . For generations X and millennial , time is still on their side . Implications : Employers will have to adjust virtually all of their policies and practices to the values of these new and different generations , including finding new ways to motivate and reward them . Generation X and the millennials thrive on challenge , opportunity , and training-whatever will best prepare them for their next career move . Cash is just the beginning of what they expect . For these generations , lifelong learning is nothing new ; it 's just the way life is . Companies that can provide diverse , cutting-edge training will have a strong recruiting advantage over competitors that offer fewer opportunities to improve their skills and knowledge base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an increasingly high-tech world , but have little interest in their employers ' needs . They also have a powerful urge to do things their way . As both customers and employees , they will demand even more advanced telecommunications and Internet-based transactions . * Time is becoming the world 's most precious commodity . * Computers , electronic communications , the Internet , and other technologies are making national and international economies much more competitive . * In the United States , workers spend about 10% more time on the job than they did a decade ago . European executives and nonunionized workers face the same trend . * In this high-pressure environment , single workers and twoincome couples are increasingly desperate for any product that offers to simplify their lives or grant them a taste of luxury-and they can afford to buy it . Photograph Time is increasingly precious , and stress-related problems will continue to grow . // * China 's rapid economic development means its workers are experiencing faster-paced and timepressured lives . In a recent survey by the Chinese news portal Sina.com , 56% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said they were never late and were intolerant of other people 's tardiness , suggesting a new cultural challenge to the traditional Chinese concept of a leisurely existence . Implications : Stress-related problems affecting employee morale and wellness will continue to grow . Companies must help employees balance their time at work with their family lives and need for leisure . This may reduce short-term profits but will aid profitability in the long run . As time for shopping continues to evaporate , Internet and mail-order marketers will have a growing advantage over traditional stores . Management Trends * More entrepreneurs start new businesses every year . * Workers under 30 would prefer to start their own company , rather than advance through the corporate ranks . Some 10% are actively trying to start their own businesses , three times as many as in previous generations . * A large majority simply distrust large institutions . Most believe that jobs can not provide a secure economic future in a time of rapid technological change . Examples of Silicon Valley start-ups that turned their founders into billionaires " overnight " dramatically advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been moderated only slightly by the failure of many dot-com companies . * By 2006 , the number of self-employed people in the United States will rise to 10.2 million , according to BLS figures . However , Forecasting International believes that figure to be too low : Expect closer to 12 million self-employed Americans in 2006. * Women comprise a growing proportion of the self-employed in the United States , up from 26.8% in 1976 to 38.6% in 2003 , according to BLS . Photograph Entrepreneurialism is on the rise around the world , and women are a growing proportion of the self-employed . // * More women also are starting small businesses . Many are leaving traditional jobs to go home and open businesses , even as they begin a family . At least half of the estimated 10.6 million privately held firms in the United States are owned by women , employing 19.1 million people and generating $2.46 trillion in sales annually . * Since the 1970s , small businesses started by entrepreneurs have accounted for nearly all of the new jobs created . For much of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1995 , small , entrepreneurial businesses produced 1 million new full-time jobs vs. barely 100,000 among larger companies . Implications : This is a self-perpetuating trend , as all those new service firms need other companies to handle chores outside their core business . It is driven as well by the attitudes and values of generations X and millennial and by the rapid developments in technology , which create endless opportunities for new business development . Specialty boutiques will continue to spring up on the Internet for at least the next 20 years . This trend will help to ease the poverty of many developing countries , as it already is doing in India and China . * Information-based organizations are quickly displacing the old command-andcontrol model of management . * The typical large business is struggling to reshape itself . Soon , it will be composed of specialists who rely on information from colleagues , customers , and headquarters to guide their actions . * Management styles will change as upper executives learn to consult these skilled workers on a wide variety of issues . Employees will gain new power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they develop . * Information-based organizations require more specialists , who will be found in operations , not at corporate headquarters . R &D,; manufacturing , and marketing specialists will work together as a team on all stages of product development rather than keeping each stage separate and distinct . * Upper management is giving fewer detailed orders to subordinates . Instead , it sets performance expectations for the organization , its parts , and its specialists and supply the feedback necessary to determine whether results have met expectations . Implications : This is a well-established trend . At this point , many large corporations have restructured their operations for greater flexibility . However , many others still have a long way to go . Downsizing has spread from manufacturing industries to the service economy . Again , this process encourages the entrepreneurial trend , both to provide services for companies outsourcing their secondary functions and to provide jobs for displaced employees . Many older workers have been displaced in this process , depriving companies of their corporate memory . Companies have replaced them with younger workers , whose experience of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2000 . Many firms may discover that they need to recruit older workers to help them adapt to adversity . * A typical large business in 2010 will have fewer than half the management levels of its counterpart in 1990 , and about one-third the number of managers . * Computers and information-management systems have stretched the manager 's effective span of control from six to 21 subordinates . Information now flows from front-line workers to higher management for analysis . Thus , fewer mid-level managers are needed , flattening the corporate pyramid . * Downsizing , restructuring , reorganization , and cutbacks of white-collar workers will continue through 2006 . Outsourcing will continue to grow until at least 2010 . Photograph Managers will have to be more hands-on as computers and information-management systems enable organizations to shed layers of bureaucracy . // * However , many companies are finding it necessary to bring back older workers , so as to preserve an effective corporate memory . * Opportunities for advancement will be few because they will come within the narrow specialty . By 2001 , only one person for every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1987. * Information-based organizations will have to make a special effort to prepare professional specialists to become business executives and leaders . Implications : Top managers will have to be computer-literate to retain their jobs and must make sure they achieve the increased span of control that computers make possible . Finding top managers with the broad experience needed to run a major business already has become difficult and can only grow more so as the demand for specialization grows . Executives increasingly will start their own companies , rather than trusting the old-fashioned corporate career path to provide advancement . * Government regulations will continue to take up a growing portion of the manager 's time and effort . * In 1996 , the U.S. Congress passed regulatory reform laws intended to slow the proliferation of government regulations . Nonetheless , by 2001 more than 14,000 new regulations had been enacted . Not one proposed regulation was rejected during this period . * The Brussels bureaucrats of the European Union are churning out regulations at an even faster rate , overlaying a standard regulatory structure on all the national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulations is not necessarily all bad . A study by the U.S. Congressional Office of Management and Budget estimated that the annual cost of major federal regulations enacted between October 1992 and September 2002 amounted to between $38 billion and $44 billion per year . However , the estimated benefits of those regulations added up to between $135 billion and $218 billion annually . Implications : Regulations are both necessary and unavoidable , and often beneficial . Yet it is difficult not to see them as a kind of friction that slows both current business and future economic growth . The proliferation of regulations in the developed world could give a competitive advantage to countries such as India and China , where regulations that impede investment and capital flow are being stripped away , while health , occupational safety , and environmental codes are still rudimentary or absent . Other lands , such as Russia , will remain at a competitive disadvantage until they can pass and enforce the regulations needed to ensure a stable , fair business environment . Institutional Trends * Multinational corporations are uniting the world , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporations that rely on indigenous workers may be hindered by the increasing number of AIDS cases in Africa and around the world . Up to 90% of the population in parts of sub-Saharan Africa reportedly tests positive for HIV in some surveys . Thailand is equally stricken , and many other parts of Asia show signs that the AIDS epidemic is spreading among their populations . * The continuing fragmentation of the post-Cold War world has reduced the stability of some lands where government formerly could guarantee a favorable-or at least predictable-business environment . * One risk now declining is the threat of currency fluctuations . In Europe , at least , the adoption of the euro is making for a more stable economic environment . Implications : It is becoming ever more difficult for business to be confident that decisions about plant location , marketing , and other critical issues will continue to appear wise even five years into the future . All long-term plans must include an even greater margin for risk management . This will encourage outsourcing , rather than investment in offshore facilities that could be endangered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are helping unite the world but exposing themselves to increased risk , such as to terrorism and to the effects of local problems like AIDS or natural disasters . // Countries that can demonstrate a significant likelihood of stability will enjoy a strong competitive advantage over neighbors that can not . Witness the rapid growth of investment in India now that deregulation and privatization have general political support , compared with other Asian lands where conditions are less predictable . Major corporations also can help to moderate some risks in unstable countries , such as by threatening to take their business elsewhere . * International exposure includes a greater risk of terrorist attack . * State-sponsored terrorism appears to be on the decline , as tougher sanctions make it more trouble than it is worth . However , some rogue states may still provide logistical or technological support for independent terrorist organizations when opportunities present themselves . * Until recently , attacks on U.S. companies were limited to rockthrowing at the local McDonald 's , occasional bombings of bank branches and of U.S.-owned pipelines in South America , and kidnappings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major bombings , in part because U.S. government facilities overseas have been effectively hardened against terrorist assault . * Nothing will prevent small , local political organizations and specialinterest groups from using terror to promote their causes . * However , as the United States has been forced to recognize , the most dangerous terrorist groups are no longer motivated by specific political goals , but by generalized , virulent hatred based on religion and culture . * On balance , the amount of terrorist activity in the world is likely to go up , not down , in the next 10 years . This was seen in corrections to the State Department 's April 2004 report on terrorism , which originally seemed to show a sharp decline in terrorist incidents and was used to claim success for the Bush administration 's tactics in the " war on terror . " In fact , the State Department 's corrections in June 2004 showed that terrorist attacks have risen sharply since the invasion of Iraq , both in number and in severity . * Risks of terrorism are greatest in countries with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . Implications : Western corporations may have to devote more of their resources to self-defense , while accepting smaller-than-expected profits from operations in the developing countries . Like the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon , and the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania before them , any attacks on major corporate facilities are likely to be designed for maximum destruction and casualties . Bloodshed for bloodshed 's sake has become a characteristic of modern terrorism . Where terrorism is most common , countries will find it impossible to attract foreign investment , no matter how attractive their resources . Though Islamic terrorists form only a tiny part of the Muslim community , they have a large potential for disruption throughout the region from Turkey to the Philippines . The economies of the industrialized nations could be thrown into recession at any time by another terrorist event on the scale of September 11 . This is particularly true of the United States . The impact would be greatest if the attack discouraged travel . The U.S. economy is being affected already by American antiterrorism measures . Since Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from them , tourism to the United States is off by some 30% . The number of foreign students coming to American universities has declined by a similar amount . * Consumers increasingly demand social responsibility from companies and each other . * Companies increasingly will be judged on how they treat the environment . For example , home-improvement retailers Home Depot and Lowe 's have stopped buying wood from countries with endangered forests . * Safety testing of children 's products also enforces corporate responsibility . One company recently was forced to recall 7 million child car seats . Another recalled more than 440,000 pairs of children 's sneakers with metal eyelets that could become detached and pose a choking hazard . * Government intervention will supplant deregulation in the airline industry ( in the interest of safety and services ) , financial services ( to control instability and costs ) , electric utilities ( nuclear problems ) , and the chemical industry ( toxic wastes ) . * With 5% of the world 's population and 66% of the lawyers on the planet , American citizens will not hesitate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : For industry , this represents one more powerful pressure to adopt environmentally friendly technologies , to work with area schools and community groups , and to participate in other local activities . It also represents an opportunity to market to environmentally concerned consumers . Photograph Institutional integrity may become the norm as stakeholders demand transparency and accountability . // As the Internet spreads Western attitudes throughout the world , environmental activists in other regions will find ways to use local court systems to promote their goals . Litigation is likely to become a global risk for companies that do not make the environment a priority . * On average , institutions are growing more transparent in their operations , and more accountable for their misdeeds . * China , rated by Pricewater-houseCooper as the most opaque of the major nations , was forced to open many of its records as a precondition for joining the World Trade Organization . * In India , a country generally regarded as one of the world 's most corrupt , the Central Vigilance Commission has opened the country 's banking system to more effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspiring demands for greater transparency and accountability in large institutions . These include both the current wave of business scandals and the controversy over child abuse within the Catholic Church . * The wave of support for government since the September 11 terrorist attacks has made Americans willing to accept greater transparency-that is , less privacy-in their personal lives . * At the same time , the nationalist response to September 11 temporarily muted most demands for transparency in the American government . In mid-2004 , this reluctance to question Washington appeared to be evaporating in the wake of the torture scandal in Iraq . * Wars against terrorism , drug trafficking , and money laundering are opening the world 's money conduits to greater scrutiny . Also opening up are the operations of nongovernmental organizations that function primarily as charitable and social-service agencies but are linked to terrorism as well . Implications : Countries with high levels of transparency tend to be much more stable than more opaque lands . They also tend to be much more prosperous , in part because they find it easier to attract foreign investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world 's drug traffickers and terrorist organizations . * Institutions are undergoing a bimodal distribution : The big get bigger , the small survive , and the midsized are squeezed out . * By 2010 , there will be only five giant automobile firms . Production and assembly will be centered in Korea , Italy , and Latin America . * Seven domestic airlines in the United States today control 80% of the market , leaving the smaller domestic carriers with only 20%. * Where local regulations allow , mergers and acquisitions are an international game . Witness the takeovers of the United States 's MCI by WorldCom in the United Kingdom and of Chrysler by Daimler-Benz . The continuing removal of trade barriers among EU nations will keep this trend active for at least the next decade . * We are now in the second decade of the micro-segmentation trend , as more and more highly specialized businesses and entrepreneurs search for narrower niches . These small firms will prosper , even as midsized , " plain vanilla " competitors die out . This trend extends to nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boutique " businesses that provide entertainment , financial planning , and preventive medical care for aging baby boomers will be among the fastest-growing segments of the U.S. economy . Implications : Thus far , industries dominated by small , regional , often family-owned companies have been relatively exempt from the consolidation now transforming many other businesses . Takeovers are likely even in these industries in the next decade . This consolidation will extend increasingly to Internet-based businesses , where well-financed companies are trying to absorb or outcompete tiny online start-ups , much as they have done in the brickand-mortar world . This trend leads us to believe that AT &T; may be reconsolidated by 2010 . No company is too large to be a takeover target if it dominates a profitable market or has other features attractive to profit-hungry investors .
