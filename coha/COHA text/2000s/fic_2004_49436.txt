" FATHER O'CONNOR ? " <p> Joe scanned JapanAir 's NEXST-2 terminal in Honolulu International to locate the voice . He was stiff from the flight ; being tall in a crowded supersonic turned the brief journey from L.A.X . into a nightmare . <p> " Father O'Connor ! " <p> Jose Luis O'Connor , " Father Joe " to his parishioners in East Los Angeles , saw the stocky man holding the sign , his name crudely lettered and misspelled . He lifted his arm . " Over here . " <p> The sign disappeared . A moment later , he watched the man pushing through the crowd . Arab , he noted . Everywhere these days , tourists making videos , vendors taking over the market the way other former enemies had done before them . <p> The Arab touched Joe 's arm . " You come . " <p> Three days ago he 'd received an invitation from a Saudi he had n't spoken to in twenty years , ticket included . He 'd barely even thought of his former Berkeley roommate since before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuasive . They 'd been friends once ; maybe , in this new , saner world , they could be again . Plus he 'd seen it as an opportunity to get away from the nightmares that had disturbed his sleep for the last six months . <p> The Arab grabbed Joe 's carry-on bag . Outside , a dark blue Russian compact waited , its battery recharging . Joe lowered his head , bent his knees , and squeezed inside . The Arab tugged the cable free . The car careened across the tarmac , sliding under the wings of parked airliners , swerving around robot baggage trains . The driver pulled up beside an old two-seater seaplane , propellers turning . It took off before Joe had managed to fasten himself into the passenger seat . He stared down as land and then water rushed by below the wing . <p> " Mind telling me where we 're going ? " he shouted over the engine 's roar . <p> The pilot ignored him . Maybe he did n't speak English . <p> After a while , Joe dozed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slim , long-fingered , with a thin silver ring on one middle finger <p> The ring he 'd had no right to give her . <p> He startled awake , nauseous from a sick conscience , and leaned his head against the window pane . Sin rode in the heart and accompanied the sinner to the ends of the Earth . <p> Islands punctuated the indigo ocean . He glanced at his watch , which he 'd forgotten to reset , and made no sense of the displayed time . He could 've sworn they were traveling in circles , the Sun now ahead , now behind the plane as if the pilot tried deliberately to confuse him , but directions meant nothing in this liquid wilderness . <p> They lost altitude , skimming low over creamy breakers , the seaplane 's skis sending up rooster tails of bright water . He climbed out onto white sand , legs rubbery in the humid air . A young Polynesian in a white jumpsuit caught his arm , steadying him . The boy had a gun tucked into his belt . <p> Straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musical : tall palms leaning over thatched buildings , a tumble of flowers with electric colors and heavy scent . Farther down the beach , brown-skinned children splashed naked in gentle waves ; they seemed to be all about the same age , perhaps three or four . A man lounged against a trunk , watching them . Sensing Joe 's gaze , the man 's eyes flicked briefly to him , then back to the children . There 'd been something watchful in the glance , Joe thought . Or was that only a guilty conscience stabbing again ? <p> " Does this place have a name ? " <p> The boy shrugged and led him into a dim interior . Apparently none of his old roommate 's employees spoke English , unlike their employer , whom he remembered using English with a non-native 's exaggerated care . <p> If the building was Polynesian on the outside , it seemed all Arabian Nights inside : ceramic tiled floor with dark patterned rugs , low table of pale wood inlaid with ivory and mother-of-pearl . Sunlight filtered through a fretted screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exile 's attempt to cling to the things of home . <p> His host sat in a wheelchair across the table , a white shawl draped over his knees . Joe remembered his roommate as being quite a bit shorter than himself , but the chair turned him into a dwarf . <p> " Welcome , " the man said . " Forgive me if I do not rise to greet you . " <p> The eldest son of a minor member of the Saudi royal family , Ahmad al-Something Khalid Muhammad bin Something - Joe had never tried to memorize all of it , even when they shared quarters - had left America , and Joe had entered the Church , before the war began . <p> " Good to see you again , " Joe said , " I did n't know - " <p> The Saudi held up his hand and Joe fell silent while the boy set out two decanters , a brandy snifter , and a tall water glass , then withdrew . <p> A shimmer of strangeness passed over him . In the years since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they 'd become enemies . Former enemies now ; the war had been over almost ten years . Joe said , " Your invitation was quite a surprise . " <p> His host inclined his head politely . <p> " Pretty place . I missed the name ? " <p> The Saudi leaned forward and lifted one of the decanters , holding it out for Joe 's inspection . Light sparkled in the cuts of high-quality crystal . " You were always fond of brandy . I hope this will not disappoint ? " <p> He got the picture . They were going to play verbal chess , and it was n't his move . Wealth always called the shots , nothing new here . He squinted at the decanter 's silver tag . " Back then , Al , I was drinking Gallo . " <p> His host poured cognac into Joe 's snifter . " A careful host knows many things about his guest . " <p> Familiarities belonged to the past , he saw . Al-the-student had given way to Ahmad-the-careful-host . Another casualty of the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " My own tastes are constant . " Ahmadpicked up the second decanter , " imported mineral water . " <p> Irritated by the implied rebuke , he decided to press the point . " Seems like this island 's closer to Tahiti than Hawaii . Does it have a name ? " <p> For a second , Ahmad 's mouth lifted in a smile ; then his expression shut down again . " Let us , for the sake of discussion , call it Paradise . " <p> In the silence that followed , Joe became aware of the soft plashing of a fountain in the courtyard outside the open window . A quick gush of children 's voices , just as quickly vanished . <p> " Certainly beautiful enough to be Paradise , " he agreed . " But I seem to remember your father wanted you to come back to Riyadh when you left Berkeley . " <p> " I do not share my father 's politics . " <p> Joe studied his host . Most of the Muslim World climbed laboriously toward democracy since losing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most Muslim women went without veils , drove cars , and held jobs , even in Saudi Arabia . The peace was fragile but seemed to be holding . The West made a benevolent victor ; not loved - what victor ever was ? - yet accepted , as far as he was aware . <p> Tired of the waiting game , he said , " I ca n't help wondering why you sent for me . " <p> Ahmad held up a hand . " All in good time . You were always too impulsive . " <p> They 'd made odd roommates : Joe , liberal and hotheaded like his IRA father ; Ahmad the conservative scientist , uninterested in student activism or world politics . At night , they 'd argued everything from religion to American pop culture . Joe was eloquent in defense of his causes ; Ahmad expressed revulsion at American secularism . Joe remembered teasing Ahmad for hypocrisy - the Saudi had a taste for Hollywood SciFi . In turn , Ahmad derided Joe 's second-hand revolutionary zeal . Trained to debate by Jesuits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I have never forgotten our youthful discussions . " Ahmad refilled his guest 's glass . <p> Joe was suddenly uncomfortable to have that part of their past brought up . He 'd been something of an insufferable bastard in those days , the Irish in him , as his Mexican mother called it . She 'd despised the senior O'Connor 's espousal of violence for political ends , a commitment that led to his death by a British bullet . <p> " These days , I listen to other people 's problems and opinions , " he said . " I do n't push mine on them . " <p> Ahmad nodded . " I have followed your career from a distance . " <p> And just how did Ahmad manage to do that ? Not as if the life of an obscure parish priest in East L.A. made the news . " Could n't have found much of interest . " <p> " You are being considered for a bishopric . " <p> He had n't even confided that possibility to his mother . In his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accent teasing him : " Himself would like to be pope someday , is it ? " <p> " Come . " Ahmad set his water glass down . " I wish to show you something . " <p> He followed Ahmad 's wheelchair , wondering what had put his old friend in it ; the man 's thin hands turning the wheels seemed bloodless . They passed through a doorway to a courtyard , the bead curtain clicking behind them . Outside , the vibrant perfume of flowers overloaded his senses , and a sudden blaze of Sun turned a fountain 's spray into a shower of diamonds . He heard the distant susurration of waves . <p> " What do people do for a living here ? " <p> " They fish , " Ahmad said . " Or act as extras when film crews come on location . Our islanders have become quite addicted to Hollywood money . " <p> He was n't surprised Ahmad enjoyed rubbing shoulders with the Hollywood crowd . Then he thought of Annie again . She worked occasionally as an extra . Black-haired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had a kind of elfin beauty that might 've brought success on the screen someday , but her passions lay elsewhere . He remembered her vividly , visiting the cathedral under construction , laughing as he purchased the silver ring from a street vendor <p> He forced himself to shut her out of his mind . " And yourself ? What do you do ? " <p> In answer , Ahmad indicated the way through another arch to a second courtyard patterned with the lacy shade of palms . A jungle gym that looked as if it had been ordered from a Sears catalog stood in the center . An Arab guard in a shapeless tunic over American jeans slouched against the wall of a whitewashed building . Room under that loose cloth to hide an automatic , Joe thought , remembering the Polynesian boy who 'd met him on the beach , but these days it was more likely to be a laptop . The guard held the door open for Ahmad to roll through . <p> Inside , it was cool and dim . The babble of children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Ahmad stopped , breathing heavily . " My life 's work . " <p> Joe saw a dozen little girls no more than four years old , ponytails tied with bright ribbons . Three sat on a mat where a cross-legged female teacher read from a picture book ; others played computer games . One child fed carrots to a guinea pig ; another painted at an easel . The children wore shorts with pastel T-shirts . Most of them were obviously Pacific Islanders with dark skin and hair , but several were blondes . <p> " You 're running a school ? " It seemed an oddly small project for a man as intense as Ahmad to call his life 's work . <p> " Do you find them pretty ? " Ahmad asked , " Like small angels . " <p> " Beautiful kids , " he agreed . " Any of them your own ? " <p> " Like you , I have no children , but for another reason . These children have no parents . I educate them here in this kindergarten . You took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That school once stood in a run-down neighborhood where Joe had volunteered to serve the homeless and their ragged kids . Ahmad had n't been impressed by that kindergarten , he remembered , but here its clone bloomed in the South Pacific . The blondes fascinated him ; obviously Ahmad did n't confine his philanthropy to the native-born . <p> Ahmad clapped his hands . " I have brought you a visitor . " <p> A dozen little faces turned toward Joe . " Good afternoon , sir ! " the children chorused in unaccented English . <p> Something jarred about that . He would 've expected Arabic , or at least the local tongue , not English , which Ahmad himself spoke so carefully . <p> Ahmad gestured to the teacher , a slim woman with a short bob of dark hair , wearing a white silk jumpsuit like the Polynesian servant , though the way it fitted suggested a more prestigious designer . <p> " My wife completed her doctorate in cellular biology at Johns Hopkins . " <p> The woman gazed at Joe without smiling , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe the guest . He wondered again why Ahmad had brought him here . <p> The Sun hesitated on top of the wall as they came out , creating a dazzle of crimson fire in the fountain 's spray , then quickly disappeared . <p> Joe wiped sweat off his face . " A kindergarten 's a worthy philanthropy , but why here in Polynesia ? The war left enough orphans in the Middle East - " <p> " Sleep now , " Ahmad said . " Tomorrow will be time to talk . " <p> As if he 'd been waiting for this cue , the Polynesian boy appeared and indicated Joe should follow . <p> The room he entered was furnished western-style , curtained and dim . Jet lag caught up with him . He stripped off his clothes and slumped on the bed . <p> THE SOUND of children 's voices penetrated his sleep and he dreamed : A field green with spring grass - daisies - children 's hands speckled with blood <p> He sat up , disoriented . The Sun seemed to have reversed itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seaplane landed . White curtains fluttered in the breeze . He glanced out . The buildings of the compound were arranged around a series of palm-shaded courtyards ; two blonde little girls skipped rope in this one , their voices a pure , high singsong . Bright birds clattered about their heads . The game ended as he watched , and the children moved arm-in-arm through an archway out of sight . <p> A basin and a jug of water waited on a low table for him to refresh himself . He squinted at his watch . Whatever the local time might be , he realized he 'd slept almost twenty hours . He stripped and splashed water on his face and torso . <p> His host was conferring with the sour-faced Arab guard when Joe rejoined him . The man went away . <p> " I hope you slept well , Joe ? " <p> " Very well , thanks . I feel much better . " Ahmad , he thought , looked as if he had n't slept for days . Again , he wanted to ask what had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so . <p> " Then we shall eat . " <p> Ahmad clapped his hands , then gestured him to a cushion before a table inlaid with silver and brass and rolled his chair opposite . Ahmad 's wife did n't join them . Joe wondered about that - two graduates of American universities still following the customs of desert nomads ? A native servant poured flower-scented water over their fingers into a silver basin , then held out a hand towel . The mix of Arab and Polynesian , desert and Pacific , was intoxicating . <p> " You are wondering why I invited you to visit , " Ahmad said . " I shall tell you . But first I wish to discuss religion . " <p> " You paid a lot for a discussion you could 've had with any Christian in the world ! " <p> " Not any Christian . A Roman Catholic priest . You . " <p> Thin lentil soup with lemon slices arrived in delicate porcelain bowls . Joe said grace silently and picked up his spoon . The long years on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meal , " Ahmad said pleasantly . " I remember you liked to eat as well as argue . " <p> " You 've got a good memory . " <p> " It is difficult to forget when one has been defeated in every argument by a superior debater . " <p> " It was n't serious , Ahmad . " <p> The Saudi smiled , white teeth flashing in candlelight , and held up his hand . " A joke , my friend . " <p> " You think it a joke ? . " Ahmad 's angry voice said in his memory . They 'd been passing a Campus Crusade rally at Berkeley , the speaker exhorting a crowd of students in turbans and kaffiyehs to witness for Christ . <p> " All religions seek converts , Al , " he 'd said , laughing . " It 's no big deal . See ? They 're handing out free coffee and sandwiches as bribes ! " <p> But Ahmad had replied , " It is an insult . " <p> The servant returned to clear away the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served lamb and rice with rich odors of garlic and cinnamon . Was that what this invitation was all about , a chance for another debate about religion , this time one Ahmad thought he could win ? It seemed a terrible waste of money , but his host obviously was n't lacking in wealth . They ate in silence , Ahmad only picking at his plate . The man would 've done better to send the plane ticket to an American doctor instead of a priest , Joe thought . <p> The meal over , coffee came , thick and sweet in tiny porcelain cups . He thought of Ahmad in a Cal sweatshirt over crisp jeans , teaching him to brew coffee Middle-Eastern style on a hotplate in their room , one of the few moments when they 'd got along without argument . Maybe they had n't been such good friends after all . <p> Ahmad offered cigarettes in black paper , which Joe declined . <p> Joe leaned forward . " Maybe we should have that discussion now ? " <p> " I wish to speak of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been bracing himself for a repeat of one of their old arguments about the virtues of Islam and the sins of Christianity , or perhaps the venality of Judaism . This sounded more like the concern of a man sensing death 's approach . <p> " Surprised , Joe ? Is not your faith much concerned with the fate of the immortal soul ? " <p> The question was ingenuous ; he had the sudden sensation of walking through a minefield . " And yours is n't ? " <p> " On the contrary , as you well know . " <p> The servant came and lit more candles then left . In the shadows , Ahmad 's expression was hidden from him . Whatever lay behind this , he might as well go along with it for the moment . <p> " One may devoutly follow one 's understanding of the Prophet 's words - blessed be his name ! " Ahmad said . " But perhaps Allah does not will all that one performs in his name . " <p> He shook his head , then regretted it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same God we all worship , Muslims , Christians , and Jews alike - " <p> " We will confine our discussion to the teachings of Rome . " <p> There was something here that alarmed , as if his toe brushed against a dark metal fin in the sand , something bleak and ominous left over from hostilities he 'd forgotten or never really understood . <p> Ahmad stubbed out the cigarette ; smoke lingered over his head in a faintly luminous halo . " Speak to me of your Catholic sacrament of absolution . " <p> " First I 'd like to know the point of this discussion . " <p> " Do not you Romans believe that a man can unburden himself of his sins at the end , no matter how heinous , and his God will forgive ? " <p> The Church taught this was true , though he had private doubts . God was slow to send the comfort of forgiveness he craved for his own sin of omission . It would be such a little thing for the Almighty to grant : A night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayer in the confessional . Her brittle laughter . The children 's blood . <p> After a moment he said , " If the man makes a proper act of confession and contrition , he 'll receive absolution . " But he did n't believe it for himself . <p> Ahmad held up a hand ; the sleeve of his robe slid back , revealing the sparkle of a diamond-studded Rolex . " Then this priest must hear many harrowing tales of adultery and theft , perhaps even murder undiscovered . Why does he not go to the police with these tales ? " <p> He stared at Ahmad 's face in the candlelight . " A priest never reveals what 's told in the sanctity of the confessional . " <p> And carried the guilt with him to his grave , he thought . No absolution for those who through inaction allowed His little ones to come to harm . Even if action would 've required breaking the seal of the confessional . Even if it was an accidental consequence . God would never forgive . <p> " What if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surely this priest would wish to prevent the sin ? " <p> Sweat started down his neck . He swabbed it ineffectually with a linen napkin . Ahmad could n't know - it was n't possible . <p> " Would the priest then break this holy law and reveal the confession to the police ? " <p> Memory overwhelmed him : Annie on her knees , revealing plans . " They 're committing a great wrong , Father Joe . They must be stopped ! " She 'd given him time and place , but he had n't wanted to believe Annie capable of such evil - Annie of the gray eyes and slender hands . Maybe it was his own guilty desire ? Maybe he 'd dreamed of his IRA father and secretly sympathized ? Then - a morning in early spring , dew still on the grass - a little girl and her small brother , intent on who knew what childish pursuit , climbing under the construction site tape , wandering at the last minute into the tiny scrap of park in East L.A. condemned to become another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's parked bulldozers and earth-graders Annie hated so much . <p> He could 've prevented their suffering . He 'd been afraid to act and afraid to prevent others from acting , betrayed by his forbidden love . The children would haunt his dreams forever . And God would never forgive him . <p> Yet had n't he been required by his vows to conceal the secrets of the confessional ? More so those sins only contemplated , not yet committed ? No sane person would 've believed Annie meant to carry it out or had the ability ! He 'd withheld absolution , but she had n't wanted it , he saw that now . She 'd been toying with him . he did n't know why , unless it was to tempt him back to his activist past . Dear God ! He 'd even given her a ring - a " friendship ring " he 'd called it - and she 'd laughed at him that day on the cathedral 's steps . She 'd known her plans were safe with him ; she knew his secret lust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on knees and cradled his pounding head . He 'd kept the vow of celibacy made when he entered the priesthood , but God had tempted him with an ecoterrorist whose face heated his blood and speeded his heart . He 'd failed the test , and God 's little ones had died . There was no absolution for him . <p> " There are some in this world who nurse hatred like a child at the breast , " Ahmad said softly . " My father is one . Like him , they seek to avenge our loss of honor . Not overtly , for we do not have the power . " <p> He thought of his own father 's never-ending war . " Terror never succeeds in the long run . " <p> Ahmad made a dismissive gesture . " It is sinful to use what Allah creates for destruction . I have told my father this . " <p> The Polynesian boy slid quietly into the room , lit more tapers , then rearranged the white shawl over the Saudi 's legs and withdrew . Buying time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 'd been gone for several weeks on location before that confession , an absence he 'd been glad of even as he despaired . Then she 'd come back , tanned and more lovely than ever to his sinful eyes . He remembered her expressive hands folded in prayer , beguiling him into sin . For sin was still sin even when only contemplated , and a priest had no excuse . <p> " I do not have much time left , " Ahmad said . " I am dying . " <p> He looked at the Saudi 's ravaged face . " I 'm sorry - " <p> Ahmad waved his sympathy away . " The devout Muslim believes the soul is a gift from Allah and belongs to Allah . Man must not wantonly destroy what Allah creates . But perhaps you are aware that we in the Arab world were once great scientists ? " <p> He shook his head , unable to follow the convoluted thread of the Saudi 's conversation . " We owe a debt to your early astronomers and physicians , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am honored you remember this . Knowledge of the biology of the cell brings great possibilities . My wife has pursued one of these possibilities for the last ten years . What did you think of our little clones ? " <p> He blinked . " I do n't understand .... " <p> " You admired my pretty orphans . Did you not notice a certain similarity ? " <p> He stared at Ahmad . " You 're telling me those kids were clones ? " <p> " Why are you surprised ? American farmers clone their best stock , and your citizens are free to clone beloved pets . It is only human research that is banned to Western scientists . " <p> Impossible , surely ? The little girls had looked remarkably homogenous , now that he thought about it , as far as his cognac-clouded and sleep-deprived vision could tell . But clones ? <p> " The blond ones ? " <p> " A trivial task to change the DNA of hair color . " <p> After the cloning horrors of ' 03 and ' 04 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 'd thought even the most extreme radicals had given up any idea of cloning humans . <p> " Hard to believe , Ahmad ! " <p> Ahmad gazed at him for a moment , then took out a small phone and spoke rapidly in Arabic . A few seconds passed , then the bead curtain swung , and the Arab guard he 'd seen earlier entered with two tiny girls , one blond , one brunette . The children were dressed for bed in identical cotton nightshirts embroidered with flowers at the neck ; the dark-haired child carried a white puppy with a pug face . Except for the hair , they might 've been identical twins : same almond-shaped eyes , same button nose , same sprinkling of amber freckles across tanned cheeks . They shuffled their bare feet , looking bashful . His mother would 've adopted them immediately as the grandkids he 'd never give her . <p> " Are you satisfied ? " Ahmad put out a hand and ruffled the nearest child 's hair , his hand then slipping down to pet the puppy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said nothing . <p> " Do you believe a clone has a soul ? " <p> The question blew away the last vestige of his tiredness . As a priest , he could n't answer Ahmad 's question . Rome had n't issued a ruling on the presence of an immortal soul in human clones . But surely , even a clone must have a soul in a world ruled by a God of love . <p> Ahmad did n't wait for his answer . " Allah creates no soul in a body made by man . The clone is like a beast of burden . Do you consider a camel has a soul ? " <p> " The Qu'ran says this ? " <p> " How should the Prophet speak of things not dreamed of in his day ? " Ahmad 's tone was contemptuous of the infidel 's ignorance . <p> " But why 've you done this , Ahmad ? " <p> " I will tell you . I know you will not betray me . " <p> His heart hammered at his ribs . " I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Annie 's voice said in his memory , and he heard again her teasing laughter , felt her warm breath caress his cheek through the confessional 's screen , smelled the musky incense of her hair . Sweat ran down his neck under the clerical collar . <p> " Unlike my father , I am not without principle , " Ahmad said . " My wife brought these clones into being , and I train them , for a purpose to which I would not commit those with souls . Consider these little ones . " Ahmad tilted the chin of the blond child . " How innocent their faces ! Who could deny them access anywhere ? When they are ready , my pretty beasts of burden will go unsuspected into your world to do work that would be evil to give to those whom Allah creates . " <p> Ahmad gestured and the sullen guard ushered the children and the puppy out of the room . <p> He shook his head . " The war 's over , Ahmad . We 've made peace . " <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands gripped the armrests of his chair . <p> Was this to be like his father 's war in Ireland , never settled , never won ? " For God 's sake - to use such little children - as what ? Suicide bombers ? " <p> " Clones . I am not as sentimental as you . " Ahmad took a cigarette from an inlaid box on the low table and lit it , his movements casual as if they discussed the weather or the latest cricket score between Australia and Afghanistan . <p> " But this is outrageous ! " <p> " Is it ? " Ahmad shrugged . " Hollywood long ago showed the uses to which constructed humans will be put . Do you not remember that old movie , Attack of the Clones ? " <p> Bile rose into his throat , scalding him . He found no easy answer for Ahmad . <p> " I will pick my targets carefully when I am ready , Joe . Some symbols are more powerful than others . You told me once how your father understood the importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've joined us if he 'd lived , " Annie 'd said . He rubbed his temples . <p> " You must not think that I have gone to all this trouble producing clones only for minor fireworks displays . " Ahmad paused , gazing at Joe as if he expected him to grasp the unspoken . <p> He did n't know what was possible in the industrialized west , let alone on an island in the South Pacific . Yet he could guess . " You 're not talking - dirty bombs ? " <p> Ahmad smiled . " Cesium-137 is not hard to acquire . Hospitals and labs are careless with its disposal . " <p> Anger flooded through him and he stood . " Why 're you telling me this ? I 'm not your priest and I 'm not a fool . " <p> " You aspired to revolution once . Do you remember how you chided me for not sharing your passion ? How you accused me of hypocrisy ? How you challenged my honor as a man of principle ? " Ahmad leaned forward and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those days - bullheaded , arrogant - " <p> " I allowed the insults to pass unmarked . You did not understand that I had larger plans . Even then , the sickness of your world might have corrupted me , made me forget what I had sworn to do . But then there was war in the Middle East and many things changed . " <p> Saudi Arabia had remained neutral at first , he remembered , even when other Arab countries joined the war against the West . But eventually it too had taken sides . " You fought for Saddam Hussein ? " <p> " I did not have the chance . " Ahmad splayed the fingers of one hand over his crotch . " American bombs took away the use of my legs and my manhood both . " <p> " Look , I 'm deeply sorry for what happened to you . And I guess I can understand your desire for revenge - " <p> " You gave up the fruit of your seed willingly . Mine was taken from me . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've told me . " <p> " But I do , Joe . I do . " Ahmad 's eyes glittered in the candlelight . " I know you very well . You understand the necessity for the death of innocents . You will keep silent about what has been confessed . It is a very good talent for one who would become a bishop ! " <p> THERE WAS LITTLE rest for him on the supersonic 's flight from Honolulu . His mind raced over the possibilities . He 'd been set up , but for what ? Nerves rubbed raw , he scanned each passenger who boarded , startled at each wail of a baby far back in tourist class , almost cried out when a flight attendant escorted an unaccompanied child to a seat nearby - a boy of about eleven or twelve . <p> Ahmad did n't intend to waste his work blowing up airliners . That was too simple . The Saudi would aim for bigger symbols to achieve his aims . And pretty little girls could slip in unsuspected where no plane could get past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temples in frustration . Ahmad had intended to wound , to burden him with unholy knowledge . To make him suffer as Ahmad had suffered . <p> Where , on location , had Annie been while she planned her act of ecoterrorism ? She 'd come back deeply tanned in the middle of winter . She 'd never told him the source of her funding , who paid for or supplied the explosives . Had his own foolish yearning for her been payment to a terrorist cell ? Had she sold him out to Ahmad ? A friendship ring for enough pieces of silver to blow up a small construction project - a trivial target to Ahmad . But Ahmad would know about the two children who 'd been killed . He covered his eyes with his hands in shame . <p> He 'd been invited to " Paradise " - the name was a cruel joke - only to see how far from entering Heaven 's gate he was in reality . It was a joke in bad taste . Nothing more . <p> He had n't believed Annie capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendant offered , his hand jittering , and spilled it on his lap . The hot liquid reached down through cloth and scalded his flesh , jerking him out of his recitation of misery . <p> There had to be something he could do . He could n't make the same mistake twice . A dozen pretty little faces rose in his mind . Too young yet , thank God ! to carry out their creator 's deadly plan . Ahmad judged him to be the hypocrite , the coward who would n't risk his own future . The man wanted him to suffer a long time , waiting , dreading . <p> This time he had to go to the authorities and tell them what he knew . <p> And in return Ahmad would reveal Joe 's own secret sin and jeopardize his budding career . <p> He set the coffee down on the seatback table . Just what did he know anyway ? Clones . Frankenstein 's little monsters constructed in a tropical workshop . Who 'd believe a bizarre story like that ? How could he even be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar at that age . He had no proof . He did n't know what was planned or when or where it might take place . He did n't know where to tell them to search . Somewhere in the South Pacific . But scores of palm-covered islands and atolls dotted the vast wilderness of the Pacific Ocean . <p> Ahmad had borne a grudge all these years against his former roommate . Now he exacted revenge , telling a " secret " that Joe would never know was true or false . Ahmad knew about Joe 's father ; this was a hoax Joe would be sure to fall for . Ahmad would be sitting there now , smoking his black cigarette and laughing . As Annie had laughed . Ahmad could die in peace , knowing he 'd ruined Joe 's peace of mind . Ahmad had won the last argument . <p> Somewhere over the Pacific , he finally slept , waking with a start an hour later when the captain announced the beginning of descent into L.A.X . <p> On a Sunday , two months after his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heavy cream-colored envelope from the bishop which had been hand-delivered while he was celebrating early mass ; his housekeeper left it prominently displayed on his desk . He tore it open . The cathedral , third in L.A. 's history , was to be formally dedicated at noon today , and the cardinal would officiate . Joe was already planning to attend . Afterward , the letter said , his superior invited him to stay for lunch , an unusual honor for a lowly parish priest . It hinted of the bishop 's high regard for this priest 's future . <p> Leaving a note for the assistant to cover the rest of the day , he showered and changed into his best black suit . Then he took the ancient Ford sedan that had belonged to the parish since ' 09 and drove west across the city . The freeway was empty in both directions , the crowded maglev flashing past down the middle . <p> The unreality of the discussion with Ahmad had faded like a bad dream , and he had n't seen Annie since his return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked out at the city with affection ; it had been extensively rebuilt after the pounding it had taken in the war . The spring day was warm , the air clear and scented with orange , everything gilded in the Southern California light . <p> The cathedral , Nuestra Senora Reina de Los Angeles , came into view , a white phoenix rising from the bomb damage , more magnificent than ever . He was touched to see the human trace : a workman racing to finish before the ceremony had left a jacket dangling from a drainpipe high up on the stone . The bishop 's residence was across a wide lawn . He parked the battered Ford . <p> A crowd of late worshipers hurried up the steps to the cathedral 's front doors . The cardinal and the bishop would be already inside , the mayor and members of the city council , perhaps even the governor and assorted politicians down from Sacramento for the occasion . Sunlight catching the lenses of a tri-vee cam filming for the evening broadcast flashed at him . Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just ahead , two nuns herded a line of children in crisp white uniforms through the smaller door set in the massive one . The last one disappeared inside , and the door closed , leaving him alone . <p> He paused at the top of the steps listening to a mockingbird 's hymn , suddenly reluctant to enter the cathedral . He turned his gaze inward , seeking the source of this vague unease . Was he afraid he did n't have it in him to be bishop someday ? Clearly that was n't it ; he looked forward to the elevation . What , then ? <p> In the distance , he saw two figures hurrying through the old churchyard , the taller one a blur of blue , the small one a flash of white . Some of the graves and massive stone-walled crypts in that yard were more than two hundred years old , whole families buried side by side when the original cathedral and the city were young . <p> And there he found the knot of guilt that would n't let him go through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their graves because of him , and he could n't bring them back if he rose to become pope himself . <p> In that crystal moment , he came to a decision . He would make his confession to the bishop about his lust for Annie and its bloody consequences , and he 'd ask for absolution . His superior , old and wise in the frailties of flesh , would understand . Yet he did n't deserve ever to be a bishop himself ; he would respectfully decline the honor when it came . He could n't undo the evils of the past , but he had years left in which to do good work in his parish as penance . Perhaps in time he 'd earn forgiveness . <p> For some people , like his father and Ahmad , the war - any war - would never be over till they had their own way . And then others would rise up in turn and make war on them . God , it seemed , declined to take sides . He 'd been pursuing the wrong goal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go away . The solution for him was never to forget . <p> " Father ! " <p> He dragged himself up from the black hole he 'd plunged into and found an elderly Los Angeles cop puffing his way up the stone steps . <p> " This one got separated from the sisters . Will you take her ? " <p> The cop pushed a little girl toward him . No more than four at the most , she wore a white dress with pleated skirt ; her cheeks were lightly sprinkled with freckles and her blond hair was tied in ringlets with blue ribbon . <p> Looking at her , Joe felt the weather change . <p> " Thanks ! " The cop grinned and was gone , taking the steps down two at a time . <p> Behind Joe , the small door set into the large one squealed on its hinges and a nun peered out . Seeing the child , she stretched out a hand . <p> " I 'll take her , Father , " she whispered . <p> The child turned to go with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cage over the heart , and his own heart seemed to leap into his throat making speech impossible . This was Ahmad 's revenge . <p> No . He recognized God 's answer . Not the passive forgiveness he 'd prayed for . On the other side of those golden doors were people , great or insignificant , who deserved to live . Out here there was only a child who was already doomed , carrying the seeds of destruction and suffering . And a priest with too much death on his conscience . <p> Ahmad had misjudged him . This time he would act . <p> He grabbed the child away from the startled nun , clutching her against him , and leaped for the steps . He could n't know what weapon he was dealing with or how much time he had . All he could do was put as much space as possible between the child and the crowded cathedral . <p> And hope that if she was laced with contagion , it would not spread far when the bomb went off . <p> He missed the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time bumped down the entire flight on one hand and both knees . The little girl , hugged close in his other arm , whimpered . Panting , ignoring the shriek of bruised muscles and torn skin , he got up and raced toward the cemetery . Now his legs gave way and he fell behind weathered headstones and across the open doorway of a stone crypt , the child under him . <p> For a moment , he lay gasping , his vision blurred . Then he forced himself up onto hands and knees again and crept further into the shelter of thick walls . Outside the crypt , dark storm clouds seemed to have rolled across the Sun . <p> Just one , he thought , one of twelve aimed at unknown targets . But this one was his . <p> The child put up a finger and touched his cheek , and he looked down at her in the remaining light . Her face was streaked with tears , but she smiled at him . <p> Ahmad was wrong about that too . The child 's soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate . <p> He smiled back in a sudden lightning flash . <p> Sidebar
