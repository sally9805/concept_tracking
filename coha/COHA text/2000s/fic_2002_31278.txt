Sean Macklin pulled his phone truck over to the corner of Forty-second and Lexington only after the third time Control had beeped him . The first summons , he knew , could 've been just an all-points beep-out for some crappy job for the first sucker who called in . The second beep he could deny ever getting . But the third time his Motorola buzzed , and his boss 's number appeared in the display box with the disheartening suffix 911 , he was forced to pay it some heed . He put the truck in park and got out , leaving it running . He stepped to the pay phone . He had a cell phone in his bag in the truck , but he knew not to use it . If his foreman learned he had a cell , he 'd never have peace again . He dropped a quarter and dialed . " Frank ? " he said when it was picked up . " He 's in the can , " a voice said . " You wan na call back or wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here I come , " he said . He looked up Forty-second . It was almost eight , and rich business types from Westchester and Connecticut were spilling out of Grand Central , their watches and shoes and brass briefcase clasps glinting in the sun . Macklin looked at their new clothes and tans , their intent steps . Most seemed happy this late-summer morning , as if each were the star of his own show and turn-of-the-century Manhattan was the thrilling backdrop . Their bemused eyes went right through him as they walked past . Of course , he thought , he did n't warrant a glance . He just worked on the scenery . He was one of the key grips . Macklin dug the plastic pay phone receiver into the crook of his neck and fished out a well-thumbed paperback from the side pocket of his coveralls . He opened it at random . Every person is given at least one opportunity to become successful , he read . The object is to be ready to capitalize when that opportunity presents itself . " I 'm ready , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said on the line . " I do n't want to work overtime , Frank , " Macklin said . " I 'm late as it is . " " Jesus , Sean . Relax yourself , " said his boss . " Where the fuck you been anyway ? I been beeping you for an hour . " " Over on Lex . You know how signals bounce around these glass canyons . " " ' Bounce around , ' my ass , " Frank said . " As tempting as that sounds , Frank , " Macklin said , smiling , " I got ta get out of here . I 'm already running late . " " Take you five minutes . Run by Eleven ninety-two Sixth and find out if cable twenty-two thirty-four terminates there . Griffin got some kind of fucked-up loop goin ' on . I do n't know what the hell he 's done . " Macklin took out a pen and scribbled on the inside cover of the book . " One-one-nine-two and two-two-three-four ? " " Uh-huh . " " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes to drive to the building three blocks up and three over on Sixth and Forty-fifth . It was a fifty-story office tower of glass and steel set back from the avenue behind two half-block-long fountains . He parked in front , reached beneath his seat , and lifted out what looked like a telephone receiver . Clipping the dial set to his belt loop , he opened the truck door and got out . More suits were on the sidewalk . They eyed Macklin and his dusty lead-splattered coveralls skeptically as he walked with them between the still fountains to the revolving door . Inside , the lobby was thirty feet high and encased in green marble . The rumble of shoes on polished stone , mixed with the dinging of the elevator doors , echoed out loudly in the high-ceilinged chamber like the sound of a massive cash register . He walked up to the security desk , took out his wallet , and showed his ID . " Got ta get down to your phone room , " he said . He signed his name in a book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened into a descending puke green stairwell that was thick with hot air . Macklin had n't been in this particular building before , but he knew the drill . They stood on less ceremony in the back rooms and basements . He wiped his forehead and dropped his eyes , scanning for rats . The phone room was better than he 'd expected . The wall-to-wall steel frame that held the posts of all the building 's phone lines was clear . Some high-speed data muxing consoles blinked along a wall . At least they did n't use it as a storeroom , he thought . There was nothing like trying to get a hundred customers back in service cramped between clothing racks or squeezed on top of boxes . He took out his paperback and checked the 2234 cable number he 'd written against the " CABLE 2234 " written in marker along the top of the frame . Well , what do you know , he thought . One of the records up in the control center actually matched something in the field . He held his dial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads across the random twin posts of a line to call back his foreman . " So how does it feel being twenty-six and about to become a multimillionaire ? " said a voice . " Well , it feels " a young voice said in reply . " It , um , it feels real good , Speed . Real good . " Macklin became very still . He could feel his heartbeat very distinctly . Relax and contract . Relax and contract . " Now , you guys literally started this company out of your garage ? " the first , smooth voice was saying . " Well , um , it was a barn actually . We were renting this farmhouse outside of Syracuse after we graduated and there was this barn and we worked out of there . " It was okay to use a line when you were working on it , Macklin knew , but if someone was on it , you were supposed to disengage . He glanced at his book . Every person is given at least one opportunity to become successful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temple and made a small dark circle in the dust of the cement floor . The object is to be ready to capitalize when that opportunity presents itself . He held his breath and pressed the receiver in closer to his ear . " What are you guys trading at right now ? " " Right now , eight and a quarter , " the younger man said . " Yeah , eight and a quarter . " " Do you know what American Internet is trading at ? " " Close to two hundred , is n't it ? " " One ninety-seven and a third . " " Jeez , " the kid said . " After the takeover , your stake will translate somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred and seventy million , Tim . " Macklin felt like he 'd just been zapped with an electric charge . Tim whistled . " I do n't know what to say . " Macklin 's knee began bobbing up and down . The name of your company , he thought . Please God , say the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ' Palomino ' anyway ? There were horses on the farm ? " Palomino , Macklin mouthed . His hand was shaking as he wrote it in the back of his book . Palomino . Palomino . " Nah , it was a joke . The landlord 's wife had this long face , bucked teeth , and a ponytail . We called her the Palomino . " " Boys will be boys , " Speed said . " Well , congratulations , Tim . You deserve it . So that 's Tuesday at nine at the Waldorf . Suite eleven-oh-six . I 'll see you then , okay ? Oh , and remember , do n't purchase any Palomino stock between now and Tuesday , okay ? Last thing we want is to make the SEC nervous , all right ? Again , congratulations , Mr. Truman . " " Gee thanks , Mr. Ang ... I mean , Speed . Thanks a lot . See you then . " " Bye-bye , " Speed said . They both hung up . Macklin listened to dial tone for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set off the posts of the line with a double snip . He looked down at the battleship gray floor . Too good to be true , he thought . No way . It 'll be some type of practical joke or something . Palomino , he thought . He 'd have to find out . He quickly wrapped up the dial set , clipped it back to the belt of his coveralls , and jogged out the phone room door . He jogged up the stairs and took out his notebook as he approached the security desk . The white-haired guard looked up . " What 's up , guy ? " Macklin said . He looked at his notebook . " Does a Speed somebody or other got an office in this building ? " " Speed Angstrom ? " the guard said . " Maybe . Is he an investment banker ? " The guard hit some keys on the terminal in front of him . " Uh , " the guard said , reading , " he 's the head of Mergers and Akwa akwa " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which company ? " The guard gestured with his chin at the marble wall . Macklin turned to the golden bull hanging there . Huge muscles stood out in the bull 's neck as if it had just busted through the majestic stone from the street . Even he knew it was the logo of one of the most prestigious investment firms in the country . " First Investment , " the guard said . Macklin felt light suddenly , helium filled , as if he 'd start to float . " Why ? Something wrong with his phone ? " the guard said . Macklin looked with effort at his blank page . " Ah , I do n't even know . The information my boss gave me is all fucked up . I work nights for christsake . I 'm supposed to be outta here already . " The guard rubbed at his own tired eyes . " Tell me about it , brother , " he said . " I 'm working a double right now myself . " Macklin nodded sympathetically with fierce effort . He needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think I 'll just let the day crew pick it up , " Macklin said , taking a measuredly casual step toward the revolving doors . " That 's what I 'd do , " the guard replied . Macklin did n't start running until he got past the fountains . He left the truck where it was and ran down Sixth toward the library , where there was public Internet access . He 'd gone two blocks when he remembered the library did n't open until eleven . Out of the corner of his eye , he spotted the CYBER LATTE sign across the street . Horns wailed as he ran into the rush-hour traffic . It was dark inside , and there was some weird New Age music playing . A line of impatient-looking executives with metallically textured shirts and ties waited by the counter . There were tables in the back with monitors on top of them . He stepped to an empty table , cleared the screen , and typed in the address of his stock-trading Web site . He 'd just typed " Palomino.com @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his elbow . It was a short , odd-looking humanoid , possibly female in origin , with severely cut black hair and thick , square eyeglasses . He watched her nose wrinkle . He knew what she smelled . He 'd been ladling molten lead on a damaged telephone cable in a dank Fifth Avenue manhole all night long . He leaned toward her . She took a step back . " Hi , " he said . " Only customers are allowed access to our terminals , " she said . " I 'll take a coffee , " he said . The side of her mouth twitched down . " Fine , " she said . " We have Moroccan Tradewinds , Kili-manjaro Supreme ... " He looked back as the screen changed . Palomino was a two-year-old book-and-CD Web company that was considered culturally savvy , he read . It was hip , upscale , another Amazon.com . " Sir ? " He thought the last thing she 'd said sounded like " la monde " or something . He would 've asked her if it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't have time . " What ? " he said " Which coffee ? " " First one sounds great , " he said , without looking at her . " For sizes , we have short , small , medium " " Supersize it , " he said . He brought up his trading account . There was five grand there from his retirement savings . All the stories he 'd heard and read about people getting rich by doing their own investing had appealed to him . He 'd taken some money out of his mutual fund and been screwing around with it . He 'd been trading for a month , and his account was up a couple of hundred bucks . He was n't sure if that was better or worse than what the pros managed . But what he had learned was that when one company took over another , the stockholders in the company getting taken over made a bundle of money . He typed up a five-thousand-dollar purchase order of Palomino stock at the opening price . Then he crossed his fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the check as he was clearing the screen . Even though it was $4.79 , he did n't say a thing . He put a five on the table , picked up the coffee , and left . Outside the sun was full up . Light flooded down the side streets and lay in white stripes across the avenue . He could feel the temperature rising already , the night cool long gone . He crossed the crowded street and walked to his truck . He opened its door and sat . Errant executives and pretty sneaker-clad secretaries scurried quickly in the buildings ' shadows like actors heading for their places before the curtain 's rise . He looked out at the building he 'd just been under . Most of it was still a stark , shadowed glass form , but when he craned his neck , he could see the dazzling sparkle of the sunlight that licked its upper floors . He winced at the first sip of the expensive coffee . It tasted like hot perfume . He got out and chucked it into the trash can on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cart there . The Arab behind the shiny aluminum counter smiled widely as he handed it over to him . " You look happy , my friend , " he said . " Just hit Lotto ? " Macklin gazed out at the brand-new day and grinned . " Something like that , " he said .
