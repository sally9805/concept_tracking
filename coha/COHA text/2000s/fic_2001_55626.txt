Listen to me , said the boys ' grandfather . When I was a boy , you had to be smart or you could get hurt . <p> Their grandfather had already sat down in his old swivel chair . He lit one of his cigars and took a big puff . The boys made themselves comfortable on the floor . <p> We milked by hand in those days , he said . And you had to look out for kickers . It was hard to tell which heifer was a kicker until you tried to milk her . Kicking seemed like an instinct to some of them , but some of them got better with practice . And just like with a good bucking bronco , you could n't predict a good kicker 's moves . <p> He laid his cigar down and rubbed his hands together . You had your four types of kickers , he said . There was your sidewinder kicker who 'd catch you in the stomach . You have to think of a hind leg going up about two feet and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles an hour . <p> He made a quick swing of his arm . That 's your sidewinder , he said . <p> Then you had your jackhammer kicker . She 'd lift a leg straight up and come down with it straight in the bucket you had under her . <p> Sort of like your jackhammer kicker was your pogo-stick kicker . She liked to bounce on her rear legs and could just as easy break your jaw with her hip as smash your foot with her hoofs . Main difference between your jackhammer and your pogo stick was that the jackhammer kicker tried to give you a knockout punch and the pogo-stick kicker tried to get you with quick jobs . <p> But then you had your fourth kind of kicker . Here 's where you get your art and finesse . The bumblebee kicker . Maybe you could spot a young heifer as a bumblebee-kicker type , but it usually took her three or tour years to perfect her style . The bumblebee kicker 's hoof would come up a little off the straw and sort of hang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the air like it was looking for a target . All of a sudden , Blare ! Maybe she 'd go for the bucket . Maybe for your wrist . Sometimes she 'd take out somebody who was standing behind her . You never know for sure . Whatever it was she went for , she 'd hit it , and it had a real sting ! <p> Wow ! said the oldest boy . How 'd you learn to keep from getting kicked ? <p> The grandfather relit his cigar . <p> Now that 's another story , he said . You had your factory-made shackles you could hook on the legs of the easy ones . There was rope that you could tie in different ways around the rear legs . Or you could tie a rope tight around the middle . This was supposed to paralyze the rear legs a little bit . Then there was kindness . You do n't like to tell too many people about this method because they 'll think you 're a softly . But I always gave kindness a try . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . <p> Did kindness always work ? asked the youngest boy . <p> Their grandfather looked toward the window , as if he could read all of his memories out there . I 'm afraid not , he said . A real kicker just made a profession of it . Kicking is the ( only thing that interested her , and she made no secret of it . That 's why milking was so dangerous when I was a boy . <p> I 've never been kicked by a cow , said the youngest boy . <p> No , no , said the grandfather . And you probably wo n't , either . <p> Because I am nice to them ? he asked . <p> No , no , said the grandfather . Because kicking has been bred out of them . You hardly have to keep your guard up at all anymore when you 're around cows . <p> That 's good , is n't it ? said the youngest boy . <p> What do you think ? said the grandfather . <p> <p> By Jim Heynen <p>  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
