Sumo has always seemed a peculiar sport . Two behemoth-size men in loincloths rinse out their mouths with water , throw salt in a clay ring and ram their massive bodies against each other for a few seconds under the suspended roof of a Shinto shrine . " Mysterious . Religious . Philosophical . " That 's how retired wrestler Keisuke Itai describes sumo . But if accusations he is making are to be believed , it is a sport that is also full of cheaters . <P> Itai , 43 , left the ring in 1991 but has stepped back into the sumo spotlight with charges that much of the flesh-to-flesh combat is mere show . In his day , he told TIME , 80% of the matches were fixed , with winner and loser worked out beforehand in the dressing rooms . " Match fixing was kind of matter-of-fact among the wrestlers , " says Itai , a jocular , baby-faced giant . " None of us felt any guilt at all . " <P> Here 's how Itai says it worked . To maintain their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matches during a tournament  --  usually a 15-day affair that could involve a match a day for each wrestler . After the first few days , some wrestlers would have enough victories , making their next bouts meaningless . So they would " sell " those bouts to less successful wrestlers  --  deliberately losing in exchange for " points " to be collected at later tournaments . Poor-performing wrestlers with no points to redeem had to buy victories , paying about $2,000 each . <P> Rumors about sumo fixing have been around almost as long as the sport . Four years ago , a tabloid magazine in Japan ran a series of articles alleging yakuza ( Japanese mafia ) ties and match rigging . Making the claims then were two ex-wrestlers , who died suddenly within 15 hours of each other in the same Nagoya hospital and of the same respiratory ailment . Sumo is indeed filled with mystery . Itai is aware of the fate of previous whistle-blowers . One of the deceased wrestlers was his stable master . <P> So it was no wonder Japan was filled with rumors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Itai was in hiding , fearing that gangsters with sumo ties had put out a contract on his life . " I 'm not afraid ! I 'm not hiding ! " Itai protested . The Japan Sumo Association , Vatican-like in its secrecy , and with a hammerlock hold on the sport , has always denied charges of match fixing . ( It refused interview requests from TIME last week . ) But Itai is n't going down lightly . He has produced tapes he surreptitiously made during sumo meetings in 1989 and 1991 . They suggest that , contrary to the association 's denials , the sumo kingpins knew all along what was going on . <P> On one of the tapes , given to TIME , a voice identified as that of one of Japan 's highest-ranking sumo officials says , " Match rigging is a rationale to skip training and daily practice and sacrifices the fundamental nature of sumo . And when this is out in the public , it will threaten the existence of the Japan Sumo Association . " Later the official directly addresses the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face that says , ' What 's the problem ? This has been around for a long time . ' But at some point , we need to put an end to this . " Itai 's allegations may be a start . <P>  --  By Tim Larimer/Tokyo
