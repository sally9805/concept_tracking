Harvest summer flavors in Colorado 's Grand Valley // What 's a sink peach ? It 's any peach that 's so juicy , you have to stand over the sink to eat it . " We grow a lot of peaches like that here , " says Jessie Jacobs , a longtime grower and owner of Valley Fruit Stand in Palisade , Colorado . Gaze at the stark , arid countryside around Palisade , and you might find it hard to believe anything as delicate as a peach can grow here . This high , unforgiving land , called the Grand Valley , is bisected by the Colorado River and stretches from tiny Palisadewhere most of the orchards and vineyards are-west through Grand Junction . " It 's a challenging place to farm , " admits Jacobs , in a bit of an understatement . Altitude is about 5,000 feet , so killing frosts and harsh winter weather are a challenge . Rainfall levels are pitifully low ( 6 to 9 inches annually ) , forcing farms to rely on irrigation .

The harvest season peaks in August ; stands brim with not only fresh fruits but also dried fruits , jams , pies , and tarts . Thumb of the valley The Grand Valley 's first orchard was planted in the late 180Os . Some of today 's major growers , like Harry Talbott , president of Talbott Farms , have pretty deep roots here . " I 'm a fifth-generation fruit grower in die Palisade area , " he notes wih pride . In his office above the peachpacking shed , he points to a relief map of the Grand Valley to help explain why fruits that wo n't survive elsewhere in Colorado thrive here . " We call this the thumb in the valley , " he says , pointing to a spot where the Colorado River flows west out of a narrow gorge . " Almost all of the orchards and vineyards are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun radiates off the Book Cliffs , and warm breezes come down the canyon , creating a microclimate that keeps temperatures milder in winter . Grand Valley farming has changed a great deal over the years . " Now , instead of 1 or 2 types of peaches , we have 20 or more varieties , " Talbott explains . And he acknowledges that while the peach is still king of die valley , the wine grape is pretender to the throne . Growing wine grapes is not exactly new here . But the early wine industry was done in by Prohibition , and those in the wine business soon forgot this valley 's grape-growing history . When grapes were once again tried here in the 1970s , it was considered a huge gamble .

" Most industry insiders thought it was insane to even try wine grapes here , " Carlson says . " They laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Between 1994 and 2003 , acreage planted with wine grapes almost tripled , making it the fastest-growing sector of Colorado 's agriculture industry . And 70 percent of the state 's wine production comes out of the Grand Valley . Cabernet and fruit wines For all the challenges posed by topography and weather , the Grand Valley does boast advantages . Horst Caspari , state viticulturist , explains , " Our isolation has helped keep pests and disease out . " Still , production is relatively small : all of the region 's 13 wineries could be called boutique . One of the largest , Grande River Vineyards , produces about 7,000 cases per year . Tasting rooms range from Carlson Vineyards ' small , rustic facility , patrolled by a housecat , to the almost Napa-esque grandeur of the French-style architecture at the new Two Rivers Winery &; Chateau . You 'll taste a lot of Chardonnay , smooth Merlot , and bold Cabernet Sauvignon . " Plantings of white varietals used to dominate , " Caspari says .

Carlson makes one wine that 's a blend of Colorado-grown pears and apples . Slightly sweet and tart , it 's called Pearadactyl , in a nod to the region 's wealth of dinosaur-fossil sites . While serious about their craft , Colorado winemakers apparently do n't take themselves all that seriously .

Make Grand junction your base , then explore from there . Take a spin across Orchard Mesa ; it 's like driving down a leafy green alley , with the sun shining through the fruit trees and dappling the roadway . Rustic produce stands seem to crop up at every bend in the road , offering homemade jams , pies , and lugs of peaches and apples . Several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valley Fruit Stand , it 's a typical August day . The fruit buyers are standing under spray misters , trying to stay cool . Rows of baskets brim with fat , fuzzy peaches , filling the air with a honeyed perfume . Jacobs closes her eyes , inhales , and sighs . " To me , that 's the smell of summer in the Grand Valley .
