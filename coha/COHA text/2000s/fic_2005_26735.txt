" She 'd waited long enough for him already . Chez Chas was a bistro in the corner storefront of Peg 's building on Grand Street in Soho . The restaurant had six tables and a tiny bar . Once featured in New York magazine as the smallest three-star restaurant in Manhattan , Chez Chas was , if not an A-list destination , a B+ . Peg had never eaten there .
