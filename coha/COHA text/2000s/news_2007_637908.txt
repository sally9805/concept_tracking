<p> SAN FRANCISCO  --  If bicycling has a nirvana , the bucolic back roads snaking throughout the Bay Area would qualify . <p> Bikers here tend to be fit , fanatical and  --  thanks to high-tech-enterprise success  --  flush . As a result , the region does not lack for fancy bike shops . Which is why ultra-exclusive Above Category stands out . <p> Tucked into the small Marin County town of Mill Valley , the shoebox-sized shop sells some of the coolest bikes you 've never heard of . Bike fanciers know about Trek and Specialized , but how about off-the-wall names such as Moots , Parlee and Land Shark ? <p> Did n't think so . <p> " The so-called Lance effect got people onto bikes that you could describe as mainstream , " says owner Chad Nordwall , whose customers include weekend warriors , talented amateurs and even area celebrity and bike fanatic Robin Williams . " But now people are saying , ' I want something unique , something no one else has . ' " <p> While European-made bikes once represented the ne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but increasingly popular brigade of American bike builders is gaining momentum across the USA , thanks to cyclists with deep pockets and taste for the extraordinary . <p> " Thanks largely to boomers , who have little free time and therefore want that time spent in a quality way , my shop has gone from nothing to super-busy in a year , " says Kevin Saunders of KGS Bikes in San Antonio . " They 're all looking for more than just a bike . " <p> Though it comes as no surprise that pros in the Tour de France , now underway , often ride custom machines that brush the five-figure mark , it 's another matter to learn that mere mortals will spend as much to slip the state-of-the-art into their garages . <p> " When I first started , I rode around on a $100 bike and loved it , but slowly I got addicted to the technology of it all , and that was it , " says Robert Vasquez , a radiologist in San Antonio who recently had KGS spec out a Parlee to the tune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where , if you want to , you can keep seeking out the smallest and lightest parts . It all adds up . " <p> A quick ultra-bike primer : You start by being measured for a frame . Then you choose your components . The bike is then built to your specs . You ride , adjust and repeat , until it fits like a glove . <p> For $22,000 , you 're certain to blow past rivals like the space shuttle overtaking a Cessna . Right ? <p> " There is no way a $12,000 bike is six times better than a nice $2,000 bike , " says Steve Madden , editor of Bicycling magazine , which nonetheless named Parlee its Editor 's Choice cycle for 2007 . <p> " Having said that , what you 're buying is an emotional attachment to something that means a lot to you , " Madden says . " Buying a hand-built bike is like sipping a great wine , slipping into a bespoke suit or having coffee roasted just to your taste . In the past few years , there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want just that . " <p> Bicycles represent a $5.8-billion-a-year business ; an estimated 43 million Americans ride with some frequency , according to the National Bicycle Association . Today , 99.3% of bicycles sold in the USA are imported , largely from factories in China and Taiwan . <p> That only serves to make a hand-built , made-in-the-USA ride  --  often from a shop that builds no more than a few hundred examples a year  --  an even more impressive statement . Despite the fact that admission to this club starts at around $4,000 , interviews with a half-dozen top builders reveal that demand far exceeds supply . <p> " The death knell for hand-built bikes rang about 10 years ago ( with the rise of quality mass-market brands such as Trek ) , so I could have never predicted this resurgence , " says Richard Sachs , a one-man operation based in Chester , Conn. , who makes six frames a month and has a 51/2-year waiting list . " I get some older folks ordering , but most are young people who see the value in something made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bikes the old-fashioned way : out of steel . On the opposite end of the spectrum is Bob Parlee , a former boat-builder of Olympic-class sailboats whose expertise in carbon fiber was transferred to the bicycle in 2000 . Since then , it has been a rocket ride to the forefront of the genre . <p> " People today want way more than just some fancy paint job , " Parlee says . " They 're looking for creations with real technological value . " <p> For many , a super-light bike is the holy grail . You get an instant appreciation for Parlee 's feathery frames when you consider that a light bike hovers around 17 pounds . Tour de France bikes ( by regulation ) weigh in at just over 14 pounds ; some Parlees have rung in at just over 9 pounds . <p> But for those who do want a fancy paint job and then some , other builders are happy to oblige . Among them are Richard Schwinn  --  yes , that Schwinn , great-grandson of Ignaz Schwinn , founder of the iconic American brand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own bikes under the name Waterford Precision Cycles . <p> Beyond crafting a flame-motif frame valued at $10,000 , Schwinn 's shop in Waterford , Wis. , has a flair for hard-carved lugs , the sleeves that connect a frame 's tubes . For one particularly religious customer , three crosses were incorporated into the $3,000-plus steel frame . <p> " You might pay $6,000 for our bikes when all is said and done , but we 're a cheap date compared to a Harley-Davidson " motorcycle , which can easily top $20,000 , Schwinn says . " We keep stretching in what we can build , and the customers just keep coming with us . " <p> Even so , Schwinn says making a living as a small-volume bicycle builder is a challenge , made even more so because of competition . <p> " There are a growing number of hobbyist builders out there now , " he says . " The smart ones keep their day jobs . " <p> There are an estimated 175 custom-bike builders in the USA , many of them one-person operations , says Don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years has staged the North American Hand Made Bicycle Show . About 400 people came to the first show ; last year , more than 4,000 attended . <p> " This niche is expanding as the riders out there grow more sophisticated , " Walker says . " People just do n't want to pull up to a group of riders and see 10 other bikes just like theirs . " <p> So some are even making their own bikes . Enrollment is surging at the United Bicycle Institute 's two-week frame-building course , says John Baxter , administrator at the school in Ashland , Ore . Four years ago , the classes ( $2,300 for steel , $3,000 for titanium ) booked up a few weeks before starting . Today , they 're full roughly eight months in advance . <p> " We get some people who work at bike shops , but we 're seeing a growth in another category : folks who have a lot of expensive bikes at home and just want to add one more that they 've built themselves , " Baxter says . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top builders say the Internet has played a crucial role in their success . " There 's no way we 'd be as well known to the biking community without blogs , " builder Sachs says . <p> Rick Guggemos started a blog a few years back , only to discover that countless others shared his passion . <p> " There are two groups of people chatting about this online , " says Guggemos , a real estate agent from Northbrook , Ill. , who now also builds his own frames . " Those who have the means to buy this stuff , and those who just like to dream . " <p> Mill Valley 's Above Category  --  a translation of hors categorie , the most difficult stage of any professional race  --  gets a good number of both crossing the threshold . <p> Customers often linger before a shelf brimming with shiny bike parts , gawking like brides-to-be before a Tiffany window . Some walk out with just an $80 biking jersey advertising his shop , while others slip out with a childhood reverie come true . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized I would try and get something really special , " says Rhett Hobgood , 34 , a shoulder surgeon who has popped by to switch out the wheels on his new Moots , a Steamboat Springs , Colo. , company that makes frames solely out of titanium . <p> " I love the notion of coming into a small shop like this , getting treated like you 're special , and winding up with a bike that you can tell someone spent a lot of time on . " <p> Nordwall slips a pair of Campagnolo wheels on Hobgood 's ride , a $2,000 piece of his $9,000 puzzle . The native of Jackson , Miss. , smiles : " That 's all right . " <p> Asked what his wife , Shane , 33 , an interior designer with a passion for music , thinks of his indulgence , Hobgood grins again . <p> " Let 's just say she 's looking after her interests , " he says . " I think we 'll be going shopping for a new piano soon . " <p> Where the coolest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the USA .
