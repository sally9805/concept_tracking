In her immensely popular 2000 novel , Girl with a Pearl Earring , Tracy Chevalier created a fictional backstory for a famous 17th century work of art . In her new book , The Lady and the Unicorn ( Dutton ; 250 pages ) , she has created a fictional backstory for a famous 15th century work of art . It would seem the author is only too happy to be pegged as reliably formulaic . This will no doubt attract fans of the earlier novel ( the movie adaptation of which is now in theaters ) , but it also invites inevitable comparisons , and in this regard , the new book stumbles . <P> Girl with a Pearl Earring , which concerns the Vermeer portrait of a delicate young woman with an intense gaze , was all sublimated passion and quiet decorum . The Lady and the Unicorn centers on the series of tapestries that today hang in Paris ' Musee National du Moyen Age depicting a woman 's seduction of a unicorn . Not surprisingly , the proceedings are more overtly carnal . The story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose appetites pointedly contradict his name , is commissioned by the wealthy Parisian Jean Le Viste to design six tapestries glorifying the nobleman 's status at court . Nicolas , like most of the characters , is fictional , though a Jean Le Viste did exist in the Middle Ages , and his family 's coat of arms appears in the tapestries . Other than that , little is known about the works , so Chevalier imagines that during a consultation at the Le Viste estate , Nicolas meets Jean 's estranged wife Genevieve , prim and tense , as well as her nubile and headstrong teenage daughter Claude . Prodded by Genevieve , and overcome by his urge to " plow " Claude , Nicolas persuades Jean to replace his plans for battle scenes with the unicorn motif , imagining himself as the mythical beast . <P> All this comes to pass in the first 30 pages , dispensing early on with the fundamental mystery of why the tapestries might have been woven in the first place . The drama in the following 200-odd pages is stirred up when Nicolas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with his randy ways , disrupts the family of Georges de la Chapelle , the weaver hired to implement the designs . Nicolas flirts with Georges 's blind daughter Alienor , thereby upsetting Georges and his wife Christine , who are already anxious because of the nearly impossible deadline Le Viste has set for the job 's completion . But the painter is also compelled by the mother and daughter , and they inspire him to alter some features of the woman in his designs . <P> The narrative point of view shifts among all the aforementioned characters and a few more , but each is given only the most perfunctory motivations , and their emotions lack subtext , perhaps because of the large number of people involved . Chevalier does a nice job of evoking the physical conditions of the era  --  the muddy roads and poorly lit , dank rooms  --  and her descriptions of the weaving process are interesting without getting overly technical . The Lady and the Unicorn is satisfying in its familiarity , but ultimately it feels less rewarding than Pearl Earring , mostly because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orecklin
