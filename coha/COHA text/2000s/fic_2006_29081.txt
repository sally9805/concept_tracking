Feud By Lady Grace Cavendish Random House Lady Grace Cavendish The First Day of March , in the Year of Our Lord 1570 Near eleven of the clock A new daybooke ! With clean pages and no blots a all ! The Queen gave it to me this morning and laughed and said I must be the greatest consumer of paper and goose feathers outside the men of the Exchequer and Sir William Cecil himself . She added that I had better leave off my scribbling when I was wed , for what would my husband say when he saw I had scribbled over the accounts ? I curtseyed and answered , " Then I had rather not be wed , so I need not leave the Court and can stay with you , Your Majesty . Especially if I must reckon up accounts as well . " I distinctly saw Lady Jane sniff and toss her head as if she thought I was lying to flatter Her Majesty , because Lady Jane is on fire to marry , I know not why . But the Queen smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , already cured and stripped and ready for me to cut into pens , and a new bottle of the best ink from the stationers at St. Paul 's . That made Mrs. Champernowne , Mistress of the Maids , tut and roll her eyes , for fear I would get ink on my kirtle . But then I unwrapped the third part of the present , and found it was a black satin apron backed with canvas so as to be ink-proof , which I knew would please the old Welsh fusspot . That was early this morning when we attended Her Majesty after breakfast . Now the sun is high and alas , I am bored.Here I am , sitting on a hard cushion in the Presence Chamber , while one of the Scottish Ambassadors proses away at the Queen in that strange language of theirs that almost sounds like proper English but is n't quite . Not even the Queen speaks Scots . The translator is whispering in an undertone , which is very hard to understand , and even with translation I have no idea what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with the scandalous Queen of Scots . Mary Shelton is knitting the second of a pair of silk stockings for herself , whilst Carmina is embroidering beside me . I ought really to be embroidering as well , but instead I am trying to write this with my new book balanced on my knee and the inkpot on the rush matting next to me . Mrs. Champernowne has already given me a nasty scowl , but I have my new black satin apron on and can ignore her , since it will stop any more disasters striking my kirtle . As if it were my fault that Carmina tripped and knocked my ink bottle flying last week . I did ask if I could perhaps have a black kirtle next time to hide the ink , but the Queen frowned and said it is not suitable for a Maid of Honour to wear a black kirtle . Alackaday . Still , the apron will do nicely . I do like being the youngest Maid of Honour at the Queen 's Court . I have been with the Queen here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been so kind to me since my poor mother died two years ago , saving Her Majesty 's life . But I wish I did n't have to wear suitable raiment all the time . Kirtles , farthingales , petticoats , and the like are such a nuisance , especially when I want to go climbing trees with my friends , Masou the acrobat and Ellie-from-the-laundry . And there are some wonderful climbing trees here at the Palace of Nonsuch , because we are right out in the Surrey countryside and there is a ring of coppices next to the orchards , for supplying the court with firewood . Oh no ! The first blot . Later , at the painters ' and stainers ' Workroom I am waiting for Lady Sarah to change her attire , so I will write a little more of the morning 's events . Lord ! What a to-do there was ! I wish there were a better way of writing than pen and ink , for I nearly lost another white damask kirtle despite my apron . And that big blot above was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we sat with the Queen . " Have you drawn out my embroidery pattern yet ? " she whispered . " I have the heavy linen for the sleeves now . " I sighed , put my newly smudged book down to dry , for I had no wiper or sand to blot it , and then fished about in my workbag . It is in terrible disorder , I fear , what with old quills and scraps of paper in it and my penner . I keep my embroidery work in another bag inside to keep it from getting dirty . Mary 's pattern was right at the bottom . " Here it is , " I said at last , uncrumpling it to show to her . " Oh ! " said Mary Shelton , with a big smile across her pleasant , round face . " Oh , that 's lovely ! " I felt myself going pink . I did try hard with the pattern because I like Mary , even though she snores . I had made a simple trellis-work design with curling branches for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the diamond-shapes I drew a little picture of a cat , carrying a kitten and peeping out from behind a rose . I did it from memory of when the cook in the Privy Kitchen found a mother cat with kittens in one of the woodboxes by the fire . " Ahh , " cooed Mary in delight , taking it from me . " Look here , Carmina , is n't it just like Grimalkin in the Privy Kitchen ? " " Hmm ? Eh ? " muttered Carmina , who had been dozing where she sat . Small blame to her : that Ambassador 's miserable whining voice would put anyone to sleep . It would serve him right if the Queen herself started to snore , not that she would . She always looks sharply at Ambassadors and listens to every word . I do n't know how she does it . by Lady Grace Cavendish Excerpted by permission .
