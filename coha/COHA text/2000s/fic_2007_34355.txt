Shane West held the flamethrower , stunned when he realized he was n't alone . He 'd come to the deserted beach to make his stand . His teachers were always saying he was n't working up to potential , but this was just a different kind of potential . Two girls rode by on their bikes just then-perfect but terrible timing . He recognized Mickey Halloran as she turned to stare at him , saw the fire . She looked panicked , and she must have thought he needed help , because suddenly she came charging at him on her bike . He tried to gesture " go away , " but she flew at him like a two-wheeled missile , and he had to admire her for it . He knew single-minded purpose when he saw it . But just then she went into a skid and took a header over her handlebars . Dousing the fire in a sand dune , he ran across the road , as the other girl-Jenna Carlson , he thought-jumped off her bike , ran back , and dropped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crouched , leaning over to look into Mickey 's eyes . He had never talked to her , but he 'd noticed her around school . Her face was pretty , pale , lightly freckled ; her enormous eyes were light green . Two long brown braids hung from beneath her dark blue knit cap . He could tell in one glance that it was n't good . She had hit her head when she landed , and blood was pooling on the pavement . But her eyes were still open . " Mickey , why 'd youturn like that ? Oh God ! " Jenna was crying , almost hysterical . " Do n't move , " Shane said to Mickey . " They 're going to move the U-boat , " she said . " And they 're acting like it 's a public service . " Her lips were blue ; Shane knew she might be going into shock . " Not if I can help it , " he said . " You were on fire , " she said . " Shhh , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her eyes rolled back , and her eyelids flickered . " Whoa , " he said , panicking . His heart accelerated , full blast . He had n't been there for his father , but he was here now . Back then , things had gone so wrong . This time he 'd make sure they went right . He stared down at the girl . They were in the same class , but different crowds . " No going to sleep . Talk to me . Your name 's Mickey , right ? " " Yes , that 's her name , " the friend said . " And I 'm Jenna , and she 's right , you were holding fire in your hand . What was that ? " " Mickey , hey , " Shane said , ignoring her friend . " Stay with me here . Dismantling the U-boat , taking it away ? Changing the surf , and the way the beach is formed ? How badly would that suck ? Mickey ? " " Terrible , " she said , coming back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of life . " Ca n't happen . The birds . . . snowy owl . . . need the beach the way it is . . . " " Yeah , " Shane said , thinking how sweet she looked , seeing how hard she was trying to stay alert . " And surfers need that U-boat . Birds and surfers . Fly by air , fly by sea . Come on , Mickey . Stay awake . " He looked up at her friend . " We have to get her an ambulance . " " Where ? How ? " Jenna asked , starting to cry again . She might not know exactly what was wrong with Mickey , but she could see the blood , and like Shane she knew it was bad . She was willowy and blond , and Shane took note of her pretty powder-puff looks and hoped she could be tough right now . " We 're five miles from the main road , and cell phones do n't work down here , " she said . Shane had come the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken down , and he had no money to fix it . His mother was out of town , so he could n't borrow hers . Besides , cars left tire marks , and any idiot with a TV had seen enough forensics shows to know that treads could be traced . So he 'd fit everything he needed into his pockets , carried the rest , and come to do what needed to be done . " I 'll run for help , " he said , peeling off his parka . It was old , patched in places by silver duct tape . " You keep her awake and talking no matter what-you hear me ? " " Yes , " Jenna said . " Do n't move her , " he said . " Not even an inch . " Mickey was trembling . As he tucked his coat around her , careful not to jostle her , Shane touched her face ; it was ice cold . She gazed up at him as if he was some kind of savior . The look in her eyes caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life in his hands . " Does it hurt ? " he asked . Her mouth moved , but no sound came out . " Think of that snowy owl , " he said . " Just stay wide awake , and wish , and the owl will fly overhead . Just keep your eyes open so you do n't miss it . " " You saw it ? " Mickey managed to whisper . " Of course , " Shane said , staring into Mickey 's green eyes . " Every time I surf . It 's been here all winter . " Then , to her friend , " Remember what I said-keep her awake . " " Okay . Hurry ! " Jenna said . Shane jumped up . " Watch for the owl , " he said to Mickey , and then took off running . In another phase of his life , he 'd been on the track team . His event had been the hundred-yard dash , but he was n't a bad distance runner . Right now , although he had five miles to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it were a sprint-flat out , as fast as he could go . He 'd been young when his father had died , but if he could have run for help like now , he would have . Today , he knew failure was not an option . Surfing all winter , powering through the Atlantic cross-chop , kept him lean and mean , and he used the look in Mickey 's eyes to make him run faster than he ever had . He headed up the road , the dunes at his right . The thicket had thinned out here , and an icy wind blew full force off the ocean . Sand had drifted right onto the pavement ; he saw the drifty remains of the girls ' bike tire marks and admired them for riding down here on such a day . Hardly anyone loved this remote winter beach the way he did , not even most of his surfing buddies . They went for easy access , at the town beach . Mickey had mentioned the snowy owl . Was the bird the reason she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he got to the ranger station , his stomach tightened . This was n't going to be pretty . He saw O'Casey 's green truck parked outside the low one-story building . Painted gray-blue , the color of the February sea , the ranger station blended into the sea and sky , into the beach itself . Shane tore up the steps , into the office . O'Casey sat at his desk , dressed in his khaki uniform , glancing up over his reading glasses , looking just like the hard-ass authority figure that he was . Ex-Marine , people said . Shane would n't be surprised , and he thought of his mother down at Camp Lejeune . Jerks . Standing there , not wanting the ranger to see how out of breath he was , Shane glared down . He watched O'Casey tense up , his hand inching toward the desk drawer . Did he keep a sidearm in there ? Jesus Christ , Semper Fi . " What brings you back here ? " O'Casey asked . " Call 911 , " Shane said to his old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There 's a hurt girl , " Shane said . " Hurry up . " All at once the ranger was on his feet . One hand reaching for the radio-static cracking , the police dispatcher taking the information as Shane relayed it : " Injured girl , bike wipeout , Beach Road , mile marker 3 , near the jetty " - other hand grabbing his jacket , a bulky green government-issue job , just about as beat-up as the one Shane had left covering Mickey . In that second , registering that Shane did n't have a coat , O'Casey thrust his at him . Shane refused to take it . He backed toward the door , hating to stand by the ranger . At six foot four , O'Casey towered over him . His shoulders were huge , but he somehow managed to look fit and trim for an old guy . His skin was weathered and lined , his hair nearly all gray . The way his eyes looked behind those reading glasses : like he 'd spent most of his life either in battle or looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's spine . Locking the door behind him , O'Casey followed Shane down the steps . They climbed into the beach truck . The bench seat was cluttered up with coiled lines , binoculars , gnarly old leather gloves , and a printer 's box of new Refuge Beach brochures-ready for next summer . " What 's that smell ? " O'Casey asked as he backed out of the sandy lot . Shane knew he reeked of kerosene , but he just stayed silent , staring at O'Casey . It was a combination of disbelief and dare : disbelief the ranger could ask that when a girl was lying hurt in the road up ahead , and daring him to figure out what Shane was planning next . " You 're on probation , " O'Casey said . " As far as I 'm concerned , they should have taken your board away . " " Just for surfing the tail end of a hurricane ? " Shane asked . " Try thinking about the rescue workers who would have had to go in after you , " O'Casey said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go red , as if he 'd suddenly gotten a sunburn . " Mile marker 3 , you said ? " the ranger asked , staring down the road . " Right there ! " Shane said , pointing . But everything was different than he 'd left it . The road was empty : the broken bike had been hauled off to the side , and Mickey and Jenna sat huddled together under Shane 's jacket . Shane was n't sure he 'd ever felt this relieved : she was n't paralyzed . Jumping out of the truck , Shane ran to her . Her brown braids and the side of her face were streaked with blood from a scrape along her hairline . Her face was nearly blue-white , and she cradled her right arm with her left hand . At the sight of Shane-or maybe the ranger-she began to cry like a very little girl . " Let me see , sweetheart , " O'Casey said , crouching down beside her , first-aid kit tucked under his elbow , tenderly pushing her hair back to see the wound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moaned in pain . " Hey , watch it , " Shane said . " Ca n't you see she has a broken arm ? " " Is that right ? " O'Casey asked . " My wrist , I think , " she said . " It 's just hanging there , limp ! " her friend said . " She ca n't even move it ! " Mickey pulled back Shane 's jacket so O'Casey could see . Shane noticed that she 'd bled all over the nylon , and he felt glad he 'd been able to keep her warm . She was n't in shock , and she was sitting upright : two great signs . " I moved , " she said , looking up at Shane . " As long as you did it yourself , it 's okay , " he said , looking into her green eyes . " It 's when other people move you that it can be a problem . " O'Casey had the first-aid kit open now . He eased Shane out of the way , pressed gauze to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way he stared steadily into Mickey 's eyes as he gently applied more pressure . Mickey gazed up at the ranger as if he were her father , or the best doctor in the world . The trust in her eyes did something inside to Shane , made his heart tumble over , like a stone falling off a cliff . " Can we get out of here ? " Jenna asked . " It 's freezing , and we have to get Mickey to the emergency room . " " We 'll take her there right now , " O'Casey said , and when they looked up the road , they saw the convoy : an ambulance and two cop cars . " I do n't need them , " Mickey said , panic in her eyes . Shane was n't sure whether she meant the ambulance or the police . Two officers and the EMTs walked over . One of the policemen gazed down with recognition . Shane 's stomach flipped , but the cop was n't looking at him-he was staring at Mickey . " Hello there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay ? " " I 'm fine , " she whispered . Shane concentrated on the spark in her eyes . He wanted to put his arm around her , help her into the ambulance . Were they just going to let her sit here on the cold ground ? The EMTs began doing their thing , with O'Casey giving them his take on her head wound and broken wrist . Suddenly they had her up and into the ambulance ; they wrapped her in blankets and handed Shane his jacket back . Jenna was led to a squad car , their bikes loaded into the back of O'Casey 's truck . The ranger said something to the second cop . Shane saw their eyes flick over to him . His blood was on fire . He knew he should run-start now and never stop until he got to California . There were places to surf out there that made the waves here look like they belonged in a bathtub . He could find his dad 's friends , and they 'd hide him in dune shacks till he was older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here on this beach , and he had to say one last thing to Mickey . Make her a promise that would help her get well fast . Something made him know that was necessary-the fear in her eyes was too familiar to him to let her just drive away without speaking to her . He pushed past the EMTs , crawled right into the ambulance . She was already strapped onto a stretcher , orange straps tight across her chest . She was staring at him , eyes focused on his jacket . " I bled on your jacket , " she said . " I 'm sorry . " " That 's okay , " he said . " It 'll remind me . . . " " Of what ? " she asked . " Of the owl , " he said . " The snowy owl . . . " " I wo n't let them chase it away , " he said . " If it 's the last thing I do . " " Thank you , " she whispered . Shane touched her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind . The ambulance rear door was slammed shut , but he could still see her face through the window as the vehicle began pulling away . She 'd seemed really shy when he 'd seen her around school . And Shane had stayed back in grammar school-he 'd had " adjustment problems " that they attributed to his father 's death . Whatever the reason , it had always made him feel like an outsider and he 'd never approached her . " The last thing you do , " one of the cops said . " Interesting choice of words . " " Ranger O'Casey told us he smelled kerosene on you , " the other cop said . " So we looked around and found these . " He held up the Nerf pump-action ball launcher . Unfortunately , Shane had already soaked the Nerf in kerosene-he 'd been seconds away from applying flame when Mickey had had her wipeout . " Yeah , what about it ? " Shane asked . " You think acting like a moron , destroying Cole Landry 's heavy equipment , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U-boat ? " O'Casey asked . " What 's a surf slacker care about that ? " Cop Number One asked . " It 's just a tin can full of dead krauts . " Shane opened his mouth to let loose on him , tell him that the sunken U-boat was responsible for the most reliable swells on this stretch of shore , that its length , and the height of its conning tower , and the periscope and every other bit of barnacle-encrusted metal , caused a vortex , pulling so much water from below , creating waves that moved straight and fast , folding back on themselves and erupting in terrible , elegant explosions craved by surfers everywhere . But O'Casey beat him to it . " It 's a grave , Officer , " O'Casey said . " Excuse me ? " " It 's not a ' tin can , ' " O'Casey said . " It 's U-823 , and there are fifty-five dead men aboard . " " Hey , Tim-your father 's Joe O'Casey , right ? " the other cop asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even with his jacket back on , Shane was freezing . He tried to hold the shivers inside , under his skin , so the cops and O'Casey would n't see . Not that the cops cared . One of them pulled out handcuffs , yanked his hands behind his back . " You 're under arrest , " he said . " For the unlawful use of hazardous materials , destruction of property , and we 'll see what else . You have the right to remain silent . . . "
