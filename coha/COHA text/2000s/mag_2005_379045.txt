Jeff Immelt is n't your garden-variety environmental apostle . A math whiz who played football at Dartmouth , he 's not apt to tramp about the wilderness or have Zen moments atop majestic mountain peaks . Immelt bestrides the summit of General Electric  --  a $152 billion conglomerate supplying everything from home appliances to jet engines to entertainment , via NBC Universal . When the GE CEO is n't globetrotting in his role as chief salesman , he unwinds with an activity that Earth Day types typically abhor : golf . " What gets me pumped is hitting a six-iron 160 yards on top of a hill , " he says unabashedly , speaking at GE 's bucolic headquarters in Fairfield , Conn . <P> Yet what also gets Immelt pumped is talking about the environment in a way no GE chief has before , certainly not his predecessor , " Neutron Jack " Welch , who ran the company with a brass-knuckles approach to the bottom line . Welch had a testy relationship with greens , notably over cleaning the Hudson River of PCBs , a toxic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice was banned in 1977 . Since Welch retired in 2001 , however , Immelt has been remaking GE . He recently announced a restructuring , paring 11 operating divisions to six . He has pruned slow-growth businesses like insurance and loaded up on enterprises with brighter prospects , such as media and medical devices . Now , he 's giving environmental products a starring role  --  pledging to invest in green technologies , clean up company operations and promote GE as a conglomerate even Sierra Clubbers might like . <P> Is Immelt responding to a guilty corporate conscience ? Nope . He 's seizing a blossoming opportunity : Green is where the green is . Eyeing the hot market for eco-friendly technologies like wind turbines , Immelt says he aims to double revenues in green products from $10 billion to $20 billion by 2010 . He promises to improve GE 's energy efficiency 30% and cut greenhouse-gas emissions 1% by 2012 as the company grows at a projected 8% average annual rate ( emissions would rise 40% if left unchecked ) . GE will issue annual " citizenship " reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and new slogan , " ecomagination , " Immelt seems intent on shedding Welch 's combative stance on environmental issues . One TV ad shows alluring young women in a coal mine . Even a dirty fossil fuel , the ad suggests , can be sexy if cleaned up the GE way . " When it comes to energy efficiency , environmental technology , water solutions , I want to lead forever , " says Immelt , who at 49 will probably run GE for many more years . <P> It 's fashionable to talk a good green game . In the S &P; 100 index of large firms , 39 companies issue " corporate sustainability " reports , disclosing information on their environmental and social performance and in some cases setting targets for which they may be held accountable . Pressure from activists has led Wall Street firms like J.P . Morgan Chase to assess environmental risks when deciding whether to finance projects such as gas pipelines in ecologically fragile regions . In the industrial sector , GE comes tardy to the green party , following firms such as Alcoa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago set targets for cuts in greenhouse gases and promised greater reductions than GE .
