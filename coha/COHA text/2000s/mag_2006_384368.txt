Shun Ducksworth lives with his wife and two kids in a duplex condo close to the beach . And not far from the edge . // Rising with effort from the overstaffed couch , the baby secured in the crook of his mahogany python of a limb like an M16 rifle at shoulder arms , Stacey LaShun Ducksworth , thirty-two years old , lets out a bone-weary sigh . " Lordy , Lordy , Lordy , " he declaims , his eyes rolling heavenward , toward the rough-textured plaster ceiling of his **25;2811;TOOLONG duplex condo , secured as of now with a rock-bottom , interest-only loan , due to balloon in three years , another of the myriad swords of Damocles hanging over his head . He sniffs the air in the vicinity of his daughter , Addison Leann Ducksworth , ten months old , dressed in a pink-and-white Ralph Lauren onesie , a hand-me-down from friends . His nose wrinkles ; his face contorts into a mock-hideous mask . " Let 's go , Jackson , " he orders the three-year-old . His voice is a deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tendency to drop his th 's in favor of d's-a commanding voice , perfectly suited to a man who rose to the rank of sergeant after only four years in the Marines . With the index finger of his right hand , in which he holds Addison 's bottle , her blankie , and a plastic toy bird from McDonald 's , he pokes off their thirty-two-inch Zenith television , bought on special seven years ago at Costco , as was much of what they own . Did you know that Costco even has real estate agents ? " Let 's go , Jackson , " he repeats . With children , unlike marines , you always have to issue an order more than once . " Let 's go , buddy , " a tad louder this time . " I need to change your sister . Are you ready for your nap ? Come over here and let me blow your nose . " A decade ago , he was ducking bullets in Mogadishu . Jackson William Ducksworth is sitting on the floor with a forty-eight-piece farmyard puzzle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mom was supposed to start her internship at a naval hospital , a requirement for her master 's degree in social work . Despite the emergency C-section , she reported ten minutes early on the scheduled day . That is her trademark ; she is always ten minutes early . ( Another trademark : proving people wrong . Like the time her father told her she would surely flunk out of college if she transferred to be closer to a man he had yet to allow inside his house . ) Back in those days , during her internship , Tuesdays were the worst : work from 6:30 A.M. till 3:30 P.M. , home to breast-feed Jackson , night classes , studying , bed . At the time , of course , her husband was the breadwinner , making nearly $50,000 a year as a manager of a Footlocker . His closet is still full of vintage Air Jordans . She herself owns exactly six pairs of shoes . Every time she buys a new pair , she donates an old pair . That is her personal policy . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mom , Jackson has asthma , which seems to open him up to every bug and flu that comes down the pike . He 's been sick now for several days-most of the last several months , if you add it up . They 've begun seeing a homeopathic doctor , $400 for the first consultation . They put it on the credit card , even though they vowed to use it now only for emergencies , like the $600 vet bill after their cat was attacked by a coyote , or the brand-new KitchenAid mixer-in black to match the self-timing coffeemaker-that Stacey LaShun Ducksworth bought recently as a surprise for his wife , Heather Marie Peterson Ducksworth , even though they ca n't afford it . Twin rivers of viscous green snot flow from Jackson 's nostrils , puddle above his lip . From the moment he awoke this morning-if you can call it awoke , because he never really went to sleep , he was really up all night , on and off , off and on , waking up his little sister , calling for his mommy ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a pulled muscle in her back and needed her rest so she could go to work the next day-from the moment he woke up , asking again for Mommy , who was already gone , Jackson has been cranky and high maintenance , could n't walk down the stairs himself , could n't go potty himself , knocking over the orange juice that he insisted on having in a big-guy glass instead of his sippy cup , asking every minute for a tissue , literally every minute , Blow my nose , Daddy , blow my nose , Daddy , the word like an exclamation point , a direct order , a command from on high ... Daddy ... Daddy ... DAAAAAAAD-DYYYYYYYYU ! ! ! ... the inconsolable trill of a three-year-old , which , every parent discovers , is the true age for terrible twos . " Jackson , " he implores , as calmly as he is able , " put the puzzle back in the box , please . " " I very sick , Daddy . " " I know you are , buddy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the box . You need your nap . And I need to get some studying done . Remember ? My classes ? " " Your college classes , Daddy . " Jackson sticks out his tongue and coughs-phlegmy , pitiful , an Oscar-caliber demonstration of the truly dire state of his health . His skin is eggshell white with a squirt of brown tint , like what they do with ceiling paint at Home Depot . He has his mom 's pointy noise and prominent chin , her smallish downturned eyes , her impish stick-out ears . His head is covered with a woolen thatch of tight yellow ringlets , which his daddy-who once did a six-month stint as the ship 's barber on the USS Essex-trims painstakingly , using a comb , scissors , and electric trimmer , one little ringlet at a time . Jackson sticks out his tongue and coughs again for effect , the tiny pink tongue of a baby doll , curled at the edges , cough , cough , cough , and then again , cough , cough , and then , suddenly , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rattling hacks that rack his thin and insubstantial body , touching off in turn a fountain of tears , huge crocodile tears that flow down his cheeks , mingling with the snot and the drool , splashing upon the Pergo floor that his enterprising parents installed as part of their do-it-yourself home renovation , financed by Visa , a rare and impulsive bit of live-for-today thinking that nearly ruined them . " I ... do n't ... like ... Mommy ... working ! " Jackson shrieks , a sob set between each word , his fists balled , tears and green snot flying everywhere . Now Addison spits out her pacifier and sputters a few times , like a chain saw trying to start up , and then she catches , and she is off , too , a full-blown cry , causing Jackson , the ever-indignant former only child , to cry even harder , the two wailing now in stereo , an ear-shattering duet of inarticulate woe .... And then Jackson throws up on the rug . Another day in the condo , part of an oldish , modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carlos . Along with its eight hundred square feet , the Ducksworth family holds title to half of a carport . Unfortunately , due to the placement of the communal washer and dryer in their particular allotted space , they ca n't pull either of their vehicles ( ' ' 99 Nissan Altima , ' ' 03 Honda Odyssey ) inside . One load of laundry costs eight quarters . Shun does approximately twenty loads a week . Everywhere he goes , he is always scrounging for quarters . You 'd be surprised how many people say no . Postnap , the kids are on the couch , watching Disney 's Pocahontas-a fine example of feminine pulchritude by any standard , cartoon or otherwise , especially to a guy whose last night out with his wife , sans children , was roughly twenty-one months previous , a Saturday . They saw Man on Fire . Jackson appears to be feelinga little better today , thanks possibly to the homeopathic pellets he 's been takingevery two hours , eighteen dollars for the tube , though if you tell him he seems better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes and declare : " I not better . I " till very tick " -a little problem with consonants he will no doubt outgrow , provided he quits sucking his finger , which could lead to many complications , among them a need for orthodontia , speech therapy , even corrective surgery , another of the many worst-case scenarios rattling around inside his parents ' skulls . He is sitting on the far north end of the overstaffed couch in his customary pose : his finger-the right index , which he says is chocolate flavored-in his mouth , his sippy cup of apple juice by his side , and under each arm his faithful Momos , Uvo identical furry monkeys that go everywhere . Baby Addison is propped at the south end of the couch , which was purchased at Macy 's during the Ducksworths ' more frivolous days before children , along with the matching overstaffed chair that they both hate ( only the cat uses it ) and an armoire to hold the television , as was the style before entertainment centers came in . Addison 's lids are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pacifier-a continuous , juicy suck suck suck reminiscent of Maggie on The Simpsons . Her face and onesie are splotched with orange-yam and green-pea baby food , the healthy , natural kind from Trader Joe 's . As often seems the case in two-child families , the male Ducksworth child resembles his mom , the female her dad , both in looks and temperament-two little copies , the sexes playfully reversed . Round-faced and bigeyed with a small , flat nose and twin topknots of fine chestnut hair , Addison puts you in mind of a darlingbabybear cub-clearly her papa bear 's child , though much lighter in complexion , the same eggshell white with brown tint as her brother . ( Family joke : Heather 's white genes are very dominant . ) At the moment , Stacey LaShun Ducksworth is sitting cross-legged on the floor , trying his best to gift-wrap a largish cardboard box , his thick fingers struggling with the intricacies . For long stretches of time , he stops what he 's doing and stares upward , lost in Pocahontas . Back in Soso , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week with people who spoke in tongues , where he ran the hundred-yard dash in ten-something , and where he was the first black guy ever to be elected Mr. West Jones High School , quite the Romeo despite the fact that his parents would n't let him go to dances or movies-everyone called him Stacey . It was only after he got to boot camp at Parris Island ( where no one bothered to advise him of the longterm benefits of surrendering$l , 200 of his pay in order to qualify for college-tuition benefits under the GI Bill ) that he started going by the name Shun . It 's supposed to be pronounced the same way as the word meaning " to avoid someone deliberately . " Most people , however , pronounce it Shown . He never corrects them . It 's as if he 's not quite committed to that name , either . Years ago , when he was still in high school , he asked his mom , Ora Lee Ulmer Ducksworth , how come she named him Stacey . The prettiest of three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his wife , Ora Lee was a stern disciplinarian , taken sometimes to using a tree switch , a hairbrush , or a piece of model-racing-car track to emphasize a point with her two sons , Stacey and Jermaine . Shun 's father , Norman Ducksworth , no middle name , is the son of S. L. Ducksworth , who was also a sharecropper . No one ever knew what the S. L. stood for . S. L. himself said it did n't stand for nothin ' ' . Shun sometimes wonders : Maybe it stood for Stacey . Shun 's dad was a short-distance truck driver ; for many years , he delivered chicken feed . He brought home a good enough living to move his family , after the second was born , from their double-wide trailer to a proper brick house on a street inhabited mostly by white people . They still live there today , hard by Big Creek , across the main highway from a little community called Cracker 's Neck . So why did his mom name him Stacey ? " Saw it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her husky , molasses-slow monotone , the prettiest girl in Soso in her day , perhaps , and still a looker at fifty-three , but never a woman of many words . The name LaShun came from his girl cousin LaShunda . Their family is close : two sisters and a brother who married two brothers and a sister . Twenty-two aunts and uncles in all ; uncounted cousins . Within the cardboard box that Shun is wrapping is a KitchenAid Artisan Series five-quart mixer . His wife , Heather , is one of those women who bakes . A lot . A lot . Andgoo-ood , as they like to say in Soso : two syllables , musical , emphatic , like in church . Sugar cookies . Peanut-butter cookies . Chocolate-chip cookies that Shun swears put Famous Amos to shame . Maybe toogooood , Heather jokes : Over the course of the last four years , she has been as large as a size 16 , though she 's presently down to a 12 . Ironically , in the months leading up to her first pregnancy , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She knows a lot of women like that . They lose all their weight , they 're looking the best of their lives , the rose in full bloom . And then , bingo , they 're pregnant . They never see their waistlines again . Compared with some of the women she knows , Heather looks pretty small . Anyway , Heather 's a great baker . It 's something she and Jackson do together ; Shun and Addison do their part by eating whatever is baked . While Jackson is a problem eater ( and a problem pooper , truth be told ) , Addison , like her daddy , never turns down a morsel of food . Previously , Heather always used this eightyear-old Proctor Silex hand mixer she 'd taken from her mom , MaryAnne Burroughs Peterson , who is sixteen years sober and smokes her fair share of cigarettes but does n't do much baking . Two months ago , in midbatch , the old mixer blew . There have n't been any homemade cookies since . In a way , buying this mixer for Heather-the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Shun . As the saying goes , it 's what you do that counts . Heather and Shun met eleven years ago on a fix up . He was stationed at Camp Pendleton . His marine buddy , a white guy , knew of a busload of high school chicks from Rio Vista , California-a farm town in the central valley north of Oakland-who were coming south to San Diego for spring break . The first time they met , first impression , Heather had no interest in Shun , who at that point was going by the nickname Duck . Part of the reason was his race , though she was by far the most liberal of her friends , the only one who ever hungout with Mexicans , which she did a little too much for her mother 's taste , tooling around at all hours in her VW Beetle , primer gray with mismatched front fenders , chugging Zima and smoking Newports . Let loose upon Pacific Beach in San Diego , the spring-break revelers , with their detachment of marines , slogged from bar to bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because she was eighteen and away from home , Heather got a tattoo , a small crescent moon at the bikini line . As the night wore on , this guy Duck-with his sweet smile and courtly manner , his chiseled shoulders and rock-hard biceps-began to look more and more attractive . When they got back to the motel room , Heather recalls , " People were passed out all over the place , and I 'm trying to sleep with Shun , and he 's , you know , rejecting everything I 'm trying . He 's saying , like , " No , you 're too drunk . We 'll do it another time . ' And I 'm like ... in shock . That never happened with guys at home . So we go to sleep and we wake up and he 's still there , which was , like , another shock , and I was like , ? did n't think you 'd stay . ' And then we all went to Disneyland and he came , too . We took the bus and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , they all kept saying , like , Oh , he 's just a one-night fling . ' But I was like , " No , I think I really like him . ' ' " Upon returning home , Heather told her parents , " I 'm in love with a black guy , " adding , " I know he 'll make a great father . " Her own father , Bob Peterson , a descendant of Okies , sells poisons and pesticides to farmers for a living . Sitting in the smokefilled living room of his ranch house , Bob Peterson looked like he did n't know whether to shit or vomit or do both at the same time , as Heather recalls it . The following Christmas , Shun made his first trip to Rio Vista . He stayed at Heather 's friend 's place ; Heather brought him back a plate of food . Nowadays , everyone gets alongjust fine . Shun has never begrudged Heather 's dad his initial feelings . " Some people just need time , " he says . What Heather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More specifically , a KitchenAid Artisan Series five-quart mixer . She 's spoken of it many times . Price : $300 . There is just one little problem . Ducksworth regular monthly expenses , including mortgage , utilities , homeowners ' fees , gas , insurance and other auto expenses , health insurance for the kids , credit-card minimum payments , preschool tuition , cell phones , Costco , Trader Joe 's , regular groceries : $3,298 . Special expenses ( projected , upcoming ) , like extra food for Shun 's parents ' visit , road trip to Rio Vista , gifts , clothes , personal items : $700 . Amount of money Heather has taken home in four weeks as a part-time , substitute social worker at two different area hospitals : $3,800 . Amount of money in the Ducksworths ' savings account : $0 . Seven months ago , the impossible happened : Stacey LaShun Ducksworth , Mr. West Jones High , was fired from his job . He 'd worked for Footlocker for seven and a half years-almost ten if you include the years during high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Diego area , his superiors took issue with Shun 's work on several counts , some of which he could have controlled ( recruiting more people into the Footlocker management system , keeping more up-to-date with paperwork , cracking the whip harder on employees ) and some of which he could not have controlled ( the lack of square footage at his store , leaving no room for inventory , which continued nevertheless to arrive in daily shipments from two different sources , piling up everywhere , causing Shun to feel very much like Mickey in Fantasia , fighting a flood tide of bewitched and overpriced athletic shoes ) . With the job , of course , went the health care . Also into the latrine went the deal for the new house . They 'd been days from closing : three bedrooms , two baths , a washer and dryer , a yard ... they 'd searched for more than a year . Luckily , they were able to persuade the buyer of their condo to shut down the deal , which was also about to close . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an **25;2838;TOOLONG duplex condo , two bedrooms , one bath , some renovation , twenty-five minutes from the Pacific Ocean : $323,000 . Within days of Shun 's dismissal . Heather had him on unemployment . Though he 'd sobbed via cell phone on the day of his firing , by the time he got to the condo he was dry-eyed , and he has remained so ever since . For the next six months , he received a check for $781 every two weeks . Meanwhile , Heather increased her parttime hours at a clinic run by a pair of married chiropractors : she did the books and also baby-sat their son . The Ducksworths also refinanced their condo , folding in all their debts ( car and motorcycle payments and $20,000 on three credit cards ) , lowering their monthly nut considerably . After looking for work with disappointing results . Shun realized that he was never going to find the kind of high-paying job he needed if he did n't have a college diploma . In Shun and Heather 's estimation , you need at least $100,000 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much , you need a sheepskin-or preferably , in today 's America , two people with sheepskins . Their course was clear : Heather would go to work full-rime ; Shun would take care of the kids and go to college at night . Now , for the first time since sixth grade-when he started his first job , at one of the chicken houses his dad delivered to-Shun is unemployed . More to the point , he is a kept man , dependent upon a woman for his very subsistence . " I feel like I 'm the female , " Shun says in his deep baritone . " It 's like , Can I go buy this ? Can I go do that and stuff ? I asked her , " Am I gon na get an allowance or anything like that ? ' " Heather looked at him like he was crazy . Wives know how it works . Back when he was making the money , working fifty-five or sixty-five hours a week , Heather never thought twice about buying a new duvet cover at Bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on sale . " Both our names are on the checking account , " she told him . " It 's your money , too . " And so it was that Shun decided that he wasgoingto buy Heather a KitchenAid Artisan Series five-quart mixer , the kind she 'd always talked about , the kind she really wanted , the kind she would never have bought for herself . Though he did n't say it out loud , and though he did n't even think about it this way until he was asked-like his mother , whom he resembles , Shun is not a man of many words-the reason he really wanted to buy the mixer for Heather was n't just that he was hungry for some of her chocolate-chip cookies . It was just , well ... he wanted to let her know how much he loved her and the kids , how much he appreciated her and stuff , how sorry he was that the Footlocker thing worked out the way it did , sorry that he let everybody down . The truth of the matter is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district manager had warned him to shape up . He had offered to let Shun step down to assistant manager . But Shun was determined to make it . He was n't going to take a pay cut , no way . He went to Home Depot and spent his own money on shelving for the stockroom . Heather helped with the backlog of paperwork . In the end , of course , it was useless . When Shun first called Heather to tell her the horrible news , the words he chose were these : It finally happened . To find the mixer , Shun turned to his computer , an old Dell wedged between the wall and his side of the bed . Over the next few days , Shun spent a considerable amount of time searching online , most of it during the children 's afternoon naps , the only free time in his day , time he might have better used studying for one of the four finals he has coming up this week-sociology , psychology , criminal justice , and history-or writing one of the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's actually finding pretty interesting , about the history of segregation in his home state . At last he found it . Ablack one just like she wanted . " Refurbished , like new , with only a couple of small scratches . " Cost : $174 . " They had some older ones that were less money , but I knew she 'd love it , " Shun says . " I was like , Wrap that bad boy up . " And then Addison woke up screaming , which in turn woke Jackson . In his haste , Shun forgot to click the option for gift wrapping . Another day , same scene : the condo , the couch , the clock on the wall with Roman numerals , battery powered , tick tick tick , the gurgling of the eighteen-gallon aquarium , the water algaegreen , the fish sluggish ( two danios and a large tiger barb named Jake ) . Lookingdown from above the couch is a poster-sized watercolor portrait of a woman holding a rose , titled Imperfection . Shun painted it during his tenure as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shun and the kids have just returned from a brief outing . Jackson is on the floor , playing with his toy cars . When he 's feeling well , as he is this afternoon , he is bright , engaging , cuddly , amusing . No hint of the demon seed of the days and nights before . Shun worries sometimes that Jackson has a split personality , that he 's manic , hyper .. . something . He does n't like to eat . He wakes up at night shrieking for his mom . Whenever he does n't want to do something , he complains that part of him hurts-his foot , his tummy , his head . It 's as if he enjoys being sick , weirdly craves it . Shun listens to the mothers on the playground , albeit from a distance . Every kid seems to have something these days , a diagnosis . Heather tells him his fears are unnecessary ; she got her bachelor 's in childhood development . She has further advised Shun that Jackson is perfectly fine , a normal little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who does n't listen , who loses control . Hello ? He 's only three ! Of course he does n't make any sense . Heather would like Shun to go a little easy on the Sergeant Daddy routine . Choose your battles , she suggests . Does Jackson really have to eat that one last bite of hamburger before he 's allowed to watch The Doodlebops on television ? And then there is Addison : good-natured , low maintenance , her chin slick with drool , suck suck suck . At the moment , she is suspended upright in the sling of one of those round plastic activity-center thingies , an ExerSaucer by Evenflo . Each of the brightly colored protuberances that Addison can push , turn , slide , or toggle makes a different musical noise . She pushes and pokes the buttons , delighted . Again and again and again . Shun is sprawled on the couch , watching The Tyra Banks Show . Three finals down , sociology paper completed ( a comparison of the number of doctors ' offices versus liquor stores in rich versus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due tonight , is awaiting a final proofing by Heather . Also up tonight : a five-minute in-class presentation on his paper topic , followed by a final essay . The professor is an older black man who lived through the days of segregation in central Florida . Shun likes and respects him . Though he enrolled in college to get a diploma , he is beginning to understand what is meant bygettingan education ; he can feel his horizons widening . The professor was vague about tonight 's essay prompt . All he would say was that they could n't study . That is fine with Shun , because he does n't have any time to study . And no inclination , either . He is pooped . Whipped . Reat.Assedout , as they say in the Marines . After tonight , no classes again for six weeks . Ooo-rah . Since Heather is supposed to take cookies to Jackson 's school tomorrow , Shun has planned to give her the mixer tonight , when she comes home from work . He has removed it from its hiding place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it sits next to him on the sofa as he watches Tyra Banks . The camera zooms close , framing Tyra 's sparkling eyes and milk-chocolate dcolletage . Tyra looks good . Goo-ood . Maybe it 's just boredom , whatever , lack of anything better to focus on , but , Heather complains , Shun is always horny . " He would like it every single day , " Heather says . " Three or four times a day would be okay with him . Every time he touches me , or looks at me , or just brushes past , it 's always like , ? wan na have sex . ' But I 'm like , " Could you please just get that out of your mind for a minute ? Because I 'm tired and I have a headache , ' or whatever it is at that minute . Just leave me alone . And then when we finally do do it , it takes me much longer than him . And then he 's always like , " Well , if you give it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes , you know , I tell him , " Go downstairs and take care of yourself . ' " Just then , the sound of a key in the door . The knob turns . Shun checks the clock : 3:35 . " Mommy ! " trills Jackson . " Mmmmmmmmm. ' ' " gurglesAddison . Heather steps into the condo , hangs her keys on the hook , puts her purse down on the table . Hands on hips , she takes stock : Shun sprawled , Tyra on TV , a load of dirty laundry sitting on the overstuffed chair that they both hate , the cat sleeping on top . She gives him a look . " Surprise inspection , huh ? " There is a guilty sound to his voice , even though he has nothing to feel guilty about , unless fantasizing is a crime , in which case all married men are guilty . Heather kneels to hug Jackson , who is wrapped around her knees . She is wearingthe new pants she bought the other night at Old Navy , marked down to $6.97 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commute , she is finding , is n't so bad if you leave yourself enough time-Heather was doinga lot of thinking . After a month at the two hospitals , she is still a part-time substitute . The good news is that she 's jumped right back into her field as if she 'd never left ; her superiors agree that she is doing an excellent job-always ten minutes early , i 's dotted and f 's crossed , comfortable with the patients in a hospital setting , familiar with available resources . She is working just under forty hours a week now , making roughly what Shun was making before he was fired . It still is n't really enough , but at least it 's steady . The bad news is that she 's already been turned down for a full-time job because she does n't speak Spanish . People are telling her to stay positive : Something will come up . Driving through the traffic , sippingfrom her Starbucks mug , Heather con templated going back to school to study espanol . She used to speak it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to relearn ? But then she thought , You know what ? If I 'm gon na be the one providing for the family , maybe I want to be making a little more money than I am now . Maybe I want to be in a different position than I am now . I 've always wanted to go to medical school . That 's really , like , my dream . Why should I be standing around taking orders from doctors all day when I 'd rather be one ? Originally , I thought I 'd wait until the kids were older , but maybe I could make it work now instead of waiting . I 'm only twenty-eight . After eight yearsof'training , I 'll still be young enough to practice for a pretty long time .... Before Shun was fired , everything had been perfect . That 's really how Heather felt . Upon completing that first internship , the one that started two weeks after her C-section , and then another one the next semester , she was awarded her master 's degree . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and raise Jackson , who would be her only child . As the months went by , however , Heather 's heart began to change . She 'd always wanted a girl . Havingone kid was so great . How much harder could it be with two ? As she always did with one of their home-improvement projects , the first thing Heather did was go out and buy a book , How to Have a Girl , by J. M. Young . Per usual , Heather worked diligently toward her goal , keeping charts of her temperature , checking regularly the viscosity of her mucus , eating healthy foods , the works . Shun helped , too . And they know exactly when it happened : Heather called Shun to tell him to come home from work immediately . It was the only other time in his life that Jackson has been left with a baby-sitter . The next thing she knew , Heather was waking up each blue California morning with two kids in the condo , and it was good . She 'd make plans for their day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the errands and the laundry , clean the house , no problem . She loved it . She loved her kids ; she was part of their lives every minute of every day . And best of all , she was the absolute queen of her domain . She set the rules , the schedules , the agenda . Everything was totally under her control . It was awesome . But then again , she had also gotten to the point where she was kind of wanting a little more time of her own . Time away . Time to be herself , to further her goals , of which there have always been many . She hated being this helpless woman who needed a man to support her . Because Shun was on commission-as manager , along with his salary , he drew a percentage of sales-his check varied from month to month . She never felt really secure . As the family bill payer , she was always juggling . " Our credit cards were our best friends , " she says ruefully . Even when Shun was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they had a cushion . She is not one to complain ; she does n't have a lot , she does n't need a lot , she 's never been one of those women . But truthfully , she never felt as if she could buy herself anything , either . Granted , with Jackson , she bought every little baby and toddler thingyou could possibly buy . That did n't last long . Fifty grand just did n't go very far . Luckily , they 'd bought the condo at the right time , in 2000 , for $132,500 . ( Though when they bought it , it felt like a huge rip-off . ) It has more than doubled in value in six years . But that is money on paper , not money you can spend . They lived okay , did n't deprive the kids of anything . But they never spent anything on themselves . She bought nothing , really , no makeup , no new clothes , maybe just a pair of sweatpants from the Gap on clearance . Shun cut his own hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight months , never had it highlighted like her friends . And pedicures : Oh . My . God . Pedicures . How she loves them-the foot massage , the vibra ting chair , the lush feeling of total self-indulgence . If she had money , she would get one every week . Every week . That would be success to Heather . That 's how it would feel to her , a thirty-dollar pedicure every week . That and a new place to live , of course , their own house , not too large , say eighteen hundred square feet-a place where more than one person could go potty at one time . And a little bit of travel maybe , as long as she 's on the subject . She grew up thirty-five minutes north of San Francisco . The first time she saw the city , she was sixteen . Total list of places she 's been in her life : Oregon , Mississippi , Texas , Arizona . She 'd love to go to the East Coast . To New York . To Maine . To New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe when I 'm a doctor I 'll make enough money so we can do some of that stuff , she thoughtto herself , commutingto work , applying lip gloss as she inched along the exitramp . And then she thought , One thing 's for sure : I 'm never gon na not have an income again . Not after what happened this time . I 'm too anal for that . I need more control . And then she started thinking about medical school , about where she might go , how she might pay for it , how it would play out ... and that 's when it hit her : her student loans ! College and grad school : $45,000 . She 's supposed to start paying them off this year . Oh . My . God . Note to self : apply for extension of forbearance , due to economic hardship . At 2 percent interest , why hurry ? Now , in the condo , home early from work , meaning fewer hours this week , less money , Heather spies the gift-wrapped box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shun raises an eyebrow . " Something for you . " She takes a seat in the glider rocker . He sets the heavy , cube-shaped package on top of the ottoman . She looks at him archly : " It 's not a KitchenAid , is it ? " Totally busted : " You 're smarter than the average bear . " " You keep asking me to make you cookies , " a slightly condescending-tone , you fcig'gn/oof . She pulls off the wrappingpaper , confirms her suspicion . Her lips tighten with disapproval . " But not just any KitchenAid , " Shun sings brightly , ta da , playing the pitchman , trying to keep the applecart upright . " It 's ... a refurbished KitchenAid . " " Refurbished ? " " Like new . " " From Overstock.com ? " " Amazon . " She turns the box over , reading each side . Some of the writing is in espafiol . " Why are you trying to read the box ? " Shun asks , annoyed . " I just told you where it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color it is , " she snaps back . " It 's green . What do you think ? It 's harvest gold . " She opens the top . " It 's black , " she says , obviously tickled . " To match the coffeemaker . " He aims his face toward hers , seeking eye contact : " Just like you always wanted , right ? " Now Jackson comes over to inspect the box . Heather removes the mixer . It is a huge thing , sleek and black , as if made from the same material as a stealth bomber . Heather pats her son on the butt with a cupped palm , lets it linger there . " With this machine , Jackson , you could make cookies all by yourself . " Jackson 's face crumbles . " I do n't wan na make cookies by myself ! " She pulls the five-quart bowl out of the box , places it on the cradle . An upbeat , mommy voice : " All you do is put everything in there and then press the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't wan na make cookies by myself ! " At last she meets her husband 's eyes . " Thanks , Shun . " " Sure , babycakes . " He gives her one of his big , big smiles . But then he notices . Something 's not right . She does n't look happy or thankful . Not one bit . " What 's wrong ? " he asks . " I thought we were n't gon na get each other any presents . " " It was cheap . " " How cheap ? " He straightens himself , voice deep and confident . " The original price was $300.1 got it for $174 . " She eyeballs him . " That 's not cheap . " " How much you wan na bet ? " " One hundred and seventy-four dollars . " She pronounces each word clearly . " On a mixer . " " Yeah ... " he says , his tone uncertain . " On a mixer for you . " " My hand can do $174 worth of mixing . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can . " " Mommy ? " " Yes , Jackson ? " " Can we make cookies now , Mommy ? " " Not right now , Jackson . " She puts the KitchenAid back in the box . " Mommy 's gon na go take a shower . " Bedtime now , one month later , 9:00 on a Sunday night . There are two bedrooms upstairs in the condo and one full bath , small enough that you can spit in the sink while sitting on the toilet . All of the Ducksworths are wearing their jammies . Jackson is in the master bedroom , eleven by thirteen feet , playing on the computer . Everyone else is in the smaller room that the kids share , Jackson 's big-guy bed along one wall , Addison 's crib along the other . For the past three weeks , while Shun 's parents were visiting from Soso , Heather and Shun were sleeping here in the kids ' room , on a queensize AeroBed . On the penultimate night of their exile , the AeroBed sprang a leak . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing with toys , which means putting first one thing in her mouth and then another . In a couple of minutes , she will pull herself up by the crib 's leg and start making her way via handholds around the room-a sign she is almost ready to walk . Next household project : childproofing . It will be the last time . Shun had the snip a few months ago . As part of their childproofing efforts , Heather has ordered something for Addison 's crib called a bumper . It serves the same purpose as the padding around a goalpost . One side effect of the cruising stage is a lot of falling down . Addison has two big welts on her forehead ; Heather keeps making nervous jokes about somebody calling Child Protective Services , which is what she sometimes has to do in her capacity at the hospital . Included with the bumper , which was ordered online , is a matching dust ruffle , another of the many and varied household necessities that Shun does n't understand the need for-as if that mattered . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disassembled . That job was his . Now Heather is bent over the reassembled crib , tying the little ribbons from the bumper around the slats . Shun is on his knees , folding laundry , putting it away in drawers . As she works , Heather is talking about the future , a subject she very much enjoys . Heather is a planner . She wants to know who , what , where , and what time-as far in advance as possible . She wants to put it on her calendar , in ink , so she can be certain of what to expect next ; in this way , she can be sure to arrive her usual ten minutes early . Shun is just the opposite . Invariably , when they 're drivingsomewhere in their Odyssey mini van , on a longish trip , there will come a moment when the kids will finally be asleep and Heather will ask , " Where do you see yourself in five years ? " Shun always has the same answer : " Do n't bother me while I 'm drivin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crib , Heather is talking about her vision of the future , this one involving possible renovations to their condo . A washer and diyer would make life easier ; it 's disgusting to wash your clothes in a machine where strangers ' underwear has been . Another idea is to finish the attic ; some people in their complex have built lofts up there , adding to their square footage by nearly SO percent . The only problem : You 'd need a ladder to get to it . " I 'm thinking that might not work , " opines Shun , folding one of Addison 's little shirts with his big hands , laying it carefully in the drawer . Heather shrugs dismissively . " In two years , I wan na move out of here anyway . Three tops . " Shun looks up at her from his place on the floor . There is a hurt expression on his brown , papa-bear face . " What ? " Heather asks , clueless . " There you go again , " he says . " What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how far to push . For the most part , these last few weeks have been pretty okay . School was out ; his parents were here to help take care of the kids . It was good to see them , especially his dad . who 'd had a heart bypass two months before Shun got fired . When Norman got sick , it hit Shun hard . For the first time , it dawned on him : He was less than eight years from forty . Man , the time really goes quick . Meanwhile , Heather 's job prospects continue to look good . She has been subbing mostly at one hospital now , getting five full days a week . Combined with the money she makes doing the books at the chiropractor 's office-the people keep begging her to stay-they are doing all right financially . And more good news : After eight months without health insurance , Heather and Shun have finally been accepted by Blue Cross , S350 a month , with no restrictions on treatment for Heather 's allergies and asthma . Overall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more dollars in their pockets now than they had when Shun was working . The only real negative thing that has surfaced is Shun 's grades : one B , one C , two D 's . The D in psychology was his second in the same course ; he 'd taken it previously , hoping to get a jump start on his freshman workload . The other D was in criminal justice , which is what he was thinking of majoring in , though he does n't need to declare a major until the beginning of his junior year . The problem is , you do n't get credit for D 's . He 'll have to take both courses again . All that time and money , completely wasted . When Heather first went online to check Shun 's grades-he had n't shown any inclination to check them himself-she was very surprised , to say the least . There had to be a mistake . She was like , " You went every day , you attended classes , you participated in class discussions-is n't any of that taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she thought , a point or two somewhere to be found , enough to get him up to a C , so he could get the credits and move on . E-mail your teachers , she urged him . Tell them about your situation . It 's called grade grubbing , she explained-a very important part of college academics . " The worst they can do is say no , " she said . " I asked him , " Do you wan na go back to work ? Do you want to find a job ? ' " Heather says . " But he 's like , " No , I do n't . " And I said , " Well then , you better figure out how you 're gon na continue in school , because you ca n't take a semester off , because then it 'll take you even longer . And you ca n't really go to work because I 'm working and we do n't want the kids in daycare . ' I told him , " We all have something to hold up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my end of the deal here . You 're not holdingup yours . ' " Shun 's reply : " I know Heather has a point , but I think that 's my problem and stuff . I know it 's just a simple e-mail she wants me to write and stuff , hut 1 still have n't done it . I do n't know why . It 's not that I 'm putting it off . I 'm not even ... well , it 's just not a priority for me . Maybe I should , you know , but I just do n't . I do n't feel like I should piss and moan about my grades . I feel like I should have done better , and that 's it . " I 'm still committed to the college route . It 's not like Heather 's forcing me . It 's something I 've always wanted to do . If you ask me about my biggest regret in life , it 's that I did n't go tocollege . It was just that after high school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You should really go to college . ' Then I had the whole break from school , the Marines . Trying to get back into college mode was hard for me . There 's a little pressure . It 's tough with the kids . " By getting a degree , I 'll be able to support my family better . That is my first priority . I still want to go the criminal-justice route , but I do n't want to do anything that 'll be too hazardous . Like , part of me wants to be a cop . I could see myself-I mean , I would n't mind falling back into that hole military-type role . I would probably still be in the Marines if it was n't for Heather ; she did n't want to live that life , and I ca n't blame her . I could go into forensics . That 's pretty cool : CSI , you know . Or corrections : I could work in a prison-though you have to literally stay in the prison for several days at a time . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway . That 's the thing-the kids . I used to work all the time , so I missed them and stuff , but I did n't really know them . Now I 'm used to seeing them every minute . I 'm attached . I do n't like to miss out on stuff . So it 's kind of like a big catch-22 . " Now , back in the kids " room , Heather is staring down at her husband , upon whose dark and handsome face is probably the most deflated , defeated , wrenchingly vulnerable expression she has ever seen grace his countenance . She feels her throat catch : " What ? " she beseeches . " What is it ? " He looks at her reproachfully . " You said / . " " What do you mean ? " " You said : " In two years , 7 wan na move out of here . ' ' " " And ? " " And ... " " Do you want to be living here in two years ? " " You said I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband of almost six years . Stacey LaShun Ducksworth : the guy who refused to do it with her because she 'd had too much to drink . Her only lover since she was eighteen-though she did kiss a guy once in Tijuana , another marine , a black guy , no less , when she and Shun were temporarily broken up . It was the only other time she had known Shun to cry . Such a good man , she thinks . A great husband , agreat dad . He does so many things right . He just does n't have the-she does n't know what to call it , the thing he 's lacking . The drive to compete , maybe , the drive to be better than others , to run in front of the pack instead of in the middle . For him , it 's always like , Status quo : Great , this is working for us . For her , it 's always like . No , it 's not . How do we make it better ? Says Heather : " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband and a dad . You ca n't do everything for everyone else . You ca n't be okay with that . Every person needs somethingof their own , agoal to accomplish that does n't have anything to do with anyone else . You have to do stuff for yourself . That 's my thing : What 's your goal ? " Heather smiles at him , you biggahot . " I 'm sorry . I did n't mean to say I. " " Well , you did . You do it all the time . " They look at each other for a moment , considering , and then Heather laughs . " I do not do it all the time , " she says dismissively . like maybe she knows she does but is not about to let on . She bends back down over the crib , proceeds to tie the remainingbumper ribbons . Shun returns to folding clothes , putting them in the drawer , grumbling silently to himself- Yeah , right-as husbands do , knowing full well you ca n't get into trouble for things you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Shun challenges . The kids are asleep . There is a large , goofy , cat-ate-the-canary smile on his face . " You did , " Heather says , somewhat dubiously . He looks at her with hooded eyes . " Okay , sonowl'mlyin ' ' ? " " No ... it 's just like ... you make it seem like I came to you with a ring and stuff . " " Who asked who first ? " Shun repeats . " You said , " If you ask me to marry you , then I 'll ask you . ' ' " " Who asked who first ? " " So I said , " Fine , will you marry me ? " " " Who asked who first then ? " " I asked you . " " Exactly . You asked me to marry you . " " But I did n't ask you in a formal manner , " Heather clarifies . " It do n't matter , formal or informal . Who asked who first ? " " Jeez , Louise ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fiiiine . " Long pause . Then Shun speaks : " So tell me : Who asked who ? " " I did n't deny it . " " Exactly .
