<p> Over the past half-century , this hard-driving entrepreneur has built a $374 million-a-year organization from scratch , a group with a staff of 24,000 and a sleek , new headquarters . <p> Yet check the fine print in the annual report : His salary is a mere $30,595 . His wife and co-founder gets another $19,975 . The couple drives two aging Lincolns , donated by friends . They have never owned a home , instead paying rent on a company-owned condo . He donates all his book royalties to charity . <p> The man who combines this business acumen and personal frugality is Bill Bright , the layman leader of Campus Crusade for Christ - a figure arguably as important to America 's evangelical Protestant movement as his famous friend , the Rev. Billy Graham . <p> If Graham has been the movement 's star , Bright has been its director , the less visible but all-important master behind the scenes . <p> The 82-year-old Graham and 79-year-old Bright - both with serious health problems - are the lone survivors among the leaders who energized postwar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Graham conserves his strength to speak at two of his " crusades " a year , Bright 's career , and indeed his life , are coming to a close . <p> Next weekend , 5,000 U.S. staffers attending a training camp at Colorado State University will celebrate Campus Crusade 's 50th anniversary and pay tribute to Bright as he passes the presidency to his chosen successor , the Rev. Steve Douglass . <p> The emotion will surely be heightened by the fact that Bright is dying from incurable pulmonary fibrosis . Bright has lost 60 percent of lung capacity and is perpetually connected to an oxygen tank . <p> But he 's unfazed by his condition . <p> " A Christian ca n't lose , " Bright says in an interview at his Orlando home . " If we live , we go on serving him . That 's an adventure . If we die , we 're in heaven with him , and that 's incredible . " <p> Raised by a churchgoing mother and skeptical father on an Oklahoma ranch , William Rohl Bright was a self-described " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1947 . <p> It happened through the ministrations of the First Presbyterian Church of Hollywood and its noted youth worker , Henrietta Mears , who later coaxed Vonette , Bright 's fiance , into commitment to Jesus as well . <p> One night the young couple literally signed a contract with God , agreeing to surrender all their possessions and seek to evangelize the world during their lifetimes . <p> The very next day , Bright recounts , God gave him the vision for Campus Crusade , which began as a small effort to evangelize students at nearby UCLA but quickly prospered and spread to other campuses . <p> Bright 's empire has since swept into 190 countries ( some clandestinely ) , and foreign nationals now constitute a large majority of the staff . <p> Besides the original college effort , there are now Crusade units targeting high school students , school board members , racial minorities , singles , athletes , politicians , diplomats , business executives , lawyers , health professionals , parents , women , children , prisoners and the entertainment industry . <p> Other Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evangelistic Wal-Mart seemingly covers everyone . Though the overlap has irritated some ministries , Bright figures there 's plenty of work for everyone and gladly provides resources to other groups . <p> Also , the other ministries usually have multiple purposes , while Bright focuses tightly on winning new converts and teaching them Christian fundamentals . <p> Crusade has held some mass training sessions , but evangelizes mostly through intimate groups and one-on-one contacts , not Graham-style telecasts and arena revivals . <p> The raspy-voiced Bright admits , " I have never been a particularly dramatic or highly entertaining speaker . " His son , Brad , adds " Crusade has never been about personalities . It 's been about getting the job done . " <p> Crusade 's best-known tactic originated in 1957 when Bill boiled the Christian message into 77 words , the " Four Spiritual Laws . " <p> Fundamentalists grumped because his pitch did n't start from human sinfulness - and intellectuals scoffed . But Bright 's drummers found the tract helpful in gaining followers and Crusade says copies have been distributed by the billions . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Found It ! " signs across U.S. cities for months , followed by the revelation that " it " was faith in Jesus . <p> By 1979 , Crusade released a two-hour film titled " Jesus , " funded by billionaire Bunker Hunt and since dubbed in 654 languages . <p> The organization , which tabulates everything it does , says cumulative audiences total 4.3 billion and 140 million viewers have registered commitments to Jesus . Some of the group 's 2,757 film teams lug portable generators for showings of the movie in the remotest corners of the planet . <p> The film was central to " New Life 2000 , " Crusade 's typically grandiose goal of working with other organizations to give everyone on earth the chance to say " yes to Jesus " by New Year 's Day , 2001 . <p> Bright ca n't say that happened , but believes God imparted this " tremendous challenge to accelerate everything we 're doing . " <p> Forever trying new ideas , Bright recently co-authored his first novel even as he fought against illness . <p> " Blessed Child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It tells the story of a boy with the power to perform healing miracles who encounters a dying evangelist - a character Bright describes as semi-autobiographical . Bright says the purpose is to show that " the God whom we worship is still a miracle-working God . " <p> In the time that remains , Bright will also record lectures for The King 's College , a non-accredited , Crusade-owned school that rents quarters in New York 's Empire State Building . The goal is to make it a suburban university for 2,000 students , offering coursework for another 10,000 worldwide via the Internet . <p> Bright will also promote fasting as a spiritual discipline , an end-of-career enthusiasm funded by the $1 million Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion , a sort of Nobel Prize for his field , that he won in 1996 . Graham was the 1982 honoree . <p> Bright 's ambitious vision has sometimes outpaced his grasp , and at one point bankruptcy loomed . But the worst crisis came in 1967 when his 13 top aides confronted Bright , not always the most congenial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Bright says the dissenters wanted younger leadership and would have turned Crusade into a church competing with conventional denominations . He staunchly disagreed , and refused to quit or change policy . Eventually , the key dissenters left . <p> His employees could n't gripe about salary disparities , since Bright pays everyone - himself included - on the same parsimonious scale . <p> Workers must raise their own salaries by soliciting donations that are sent to Crusade 's Orlando headquarters . Some foreign mission boards operate this way , but it 's highly unusual for most Protestant agencies . <p> The method guarantees that staff expansion funds itself . Gifts from 550,000 trained volunteers and 325 members of " History 's Handful " ( $1 million lifetime donors ) go toward special projects . <p> " We ask for our needs , not our greeds , " explains Bright , still a Presbyterian . <p> Successor Douglass , a 55-year-old Southern Baptist , plans no change in Crusade 's financial setup . Individual fund-raising motivates the staff and supporters , Douglass maintains , and the egalitarian pay scale " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent . <p> Douglass says Crusade helped re-energize his own faith during years at MIT and the Harvard Business School . <p> His master 's degree project was an analysis of Crusade 's administrative successes and struggles with rapid growth . When he graduated in 1969 , Bright invited him to join headquarters and apply his findings . He 's never left . <p> Douglass expects to greatly expand Crusade 's evangelism through cyberspace . Observers also figure he wo n't hobnob with high-ranking Republicans and political conservatives as regularly as Bright , whose office hallway is a Democrat-free zone of photos with Presidents Ford , Reagan and Bush the elder , who attended Bright 's 75th birthday party . <p> Douglass ' succession draws another contrast between Bright and Graham , who has designated his son to take over his organization . <p> Bright 's older son , Zac , says he never had the yen for administration . He happily pastors a Hispanic Presbyterian church in Irwindale , Calif . <p> Brother Brad , as his father once did , planned on a political career . He worked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics does n't change people where they live " and joined Crusade 's staff in 1989 . <p> From what he 's seen of the pressures on Bill Bright , Brad says , he 's never aspired to the top job . " Who in sane mind would want it ? " he wonders . <p> Certainly , Bright 's calling has been a demanding one . But , he says , it 's been worth it . " Jesus is worthy of every ounce of allegiance we can give him , " he says , " our love , our devotion , our obedience , our trust .
