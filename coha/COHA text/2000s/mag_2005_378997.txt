What explains the appeal of suicide attacks in Iraq ? For one thing , using oneself as a weapon can be a relatively effective tactic against an enemy with far superior firepower . And extremist Muslim suicide bombers believe that their sacrifice guarantees them " martyrdom " and a passport to paradise . ( That said , suicide attacks are n't unique to Islamist insurgencies . Sri Lanka 's mostly Hindu Tamil Tigers have probably conducted more such attacks than any other single group . ) <P> In Iraq most suicide attacks are thought to have been carried out by foreign fighters . Insurgent commanders tend to view Iraqi fighters as more valuable alive : they have extensive support networks and know the home terrain . " Why waste such a valuable resource on a single mission when you can use him for a number of other important tasks ? " says Navy Commander Fred Gaghan , who investigates bombings in Iraq . These days , however , more and more Iraqis like Marwan Abu Ubeida are signing up to kill themselves . That is happening , Iraqi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now involve deploying a large number of such attackers , which is depleting the supply of foreign volunteers . <P> Robert Pape , author of a book about suicide terrorism , Dying to Win , says the tactic has historically been used when two conditions are met : first , insurgents feel they are fighting foreign troops in places they regard as their homeland ( Osama bin Laden , for example , has railed against U.S. bases in the Arabian Peninsula ) ; and second , when the occupiers come from a different religious background , insurgents are able to paint them as subjugators of their faith and its followers . Those conditions , it turns out , co-exist prominently in the Muslim world today , particularly in the Middle East .  --  With reporting by Aparisim Ghosh
