Spend a few hours with Hollywood producer Jennifer Klein , and you might want to pop a Valium . Or slip her one . From the moment she rises at 7 a.m. in the Sunset Boulevard home she shares with her husband , she 's a fidgety , demanding , chattering whirling dervish of a task juggler . Right now Klein , 41 , whose credits include Pearl Harbor and Armageddon , has 15 film and TV projects in development  --  all of them requiring constant nudging and nurture . Her strategy for managing that and several overflowing In boxes : never do just two things at once if you can possibly do four or five . <P> " I 'm an obsessive and addicted multitasker and gadget user , " Klein cheerily concedes . A typical moment at her office finds Klein reviewing a screenplay by phone with its writers and jotting notes while glancing at an incoming e-mail on her BlackBerry , motioning signals to her assistant and firing off an instant message to a studio exec . " Here 's how bad it is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right before the plane lands , before the seat-belt sign goes on , I get the BlackBerry out and put it in front of me in the seat-back compartment . That way I can turn it on as soon as I land and see that little light flashing . " <P> Actually , it gets worse than that for a woman known to do her daily sit-ups during a conference call . " While I 'm driving , I 've got the cell phone out . I 'm drinking a cup of coffee , checking the Palm Pilot for the number and then calling , " boasts Klein . Yup , got that all done while stuck in traffic . <P> Like many other modern workers , Klein takes pride in being a master multitasker , zipping through her daily to-do list : " I see the red lights go on or hear the beep , and I love it . " But she has noticed some drawbacks and even some side effects : impatience , irritability and ( gasp ) some inefficiency . " Sometimes when e-mail goes down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on something , " she says . She finds herself angry and snappish when callers make poor use of her endless availability . Although she feels anxious when her In box is empty , she feels no better when it 's full : " When I wake up in the morning and have 15 e-mails , I get a nervous stomach . " <P> Klein 's action- and anxiety-packed work style may be extreme , but she 's really only a couple of juggling pins ahead of most of us . By now every modern officeworker  --  from the mail-room clerk to the CEO  --  knows that the gadgets designed to lighten our loads also ensnare us . And the dinging digital devices that allow us to connect and communicate so readily also disrupt our work , our thoughts and what little is left of our private lives . <P> What sort of toll is all this disruption and mental channel switching taking on our ability to think clearly , work effectively and function as healthy human beings ? Do the devices that make it possible to do so many things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spin our wheels faster ? Over the past five years , psychologists , efficiency experts and information-technology researchers have begun to explore those questions in detail . They have begun to calculate the pluses , the minuses and the economic costs of the interrupted life  --  in dollars , productivity and dysfunction . More important , they 're exploring what can be done about it  --  how we can work smarter , live smarter and put our beloved gadgets back in their proper place , with us running them , not the other way around .
