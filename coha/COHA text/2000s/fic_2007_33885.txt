Who 's a Putz ? My name is Roseanna Plow , and I came down the birth canal sideways . All my life , this is the way my mother has introduced me to strangers . She 's never described my birth with malice , only with wonder . It is the wonder of my mother 's life that when I left her womb , some thirty-two years ago , I made the decision to enter this world broadside , oblivious of the discomfort this might cause her , my benevolent baker , my main sponsor . My mother would hug me hard to her curvy side as she explained my arrival once more for new ears . " She came down the canal sideways , " she 'd tell the surprised listener , and I 'd feel the pokey bone of her hip against my cheek and imagine myself arriving on Long Island on some sort of gondola , no one at the helm , the boat floating sideways , smashing into everything else in the narrow channel . Always there was a beat of silence when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were waiting for the school nurse , the new neighbor , my first grade teacher to offer some reason why I might have chosen to do this . Sideways down the canal . It is an apt metaphor for the many collisions I 've had in my life-the constant clashing of horns with my mother , my now-deteriorating marriage to my husband , Teddy , which my mother had anticipated ( " Marry someone respectable , " she had said , whenshe showed me the navy blue pantsuit she planned to wear at my wedding , " and I 'll consider wearing a dress to the church . " ) , the way I 'd upset my father during college by shortening my name from Pulkowski to Plow . Last week , my husband sat me down at our kitchen table and told me in a calm voice that he was in love with another woman . Not just any woman , he explained , but my best friend , Inga . Then , as if in compliance with my mother 's prediction of his worthlessness , he packed a bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for dinner tonight , my first guest since Teddy 's departure . She is coming alone , leaving my father at home with his pot roast and his beer . She is planning , I suppose , one of those woman-to-woman talks I 've gotten used to now . On the stove in my small apartment 's kitchen , I 'm simmering a nice spaghetti sauce . It 's my mother-in-law 's recipe , of which my mother will undoubtedly disapprove . Just the same , I 'm glad for her company . It 's been eight days and three hours since Teddy packed the small Champion gym bag-tenderly tucking his iPod in last-and left our apartment . In that time I 've imagined him in the arms of my best friend , Inga . I 've imagined them in her bed , in her bedroom , which I 've seen a thousand times . The patchwork quilt made by her grandmother . The white wicker shade on the bedside lamp . The prim smell of lavender emanating from her drawers and closet . There is a little wooden plaque , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Inga on her thirtieth birthday . the f in friend means forever , it says . Now at night , when my wine bottle is almost empty , when the last chocolate chip cookie is eaten , when I 've cried as much as my body allows , the plaque seems funny to me . Inga , my F'in-friend . " I never liked that lantern jaw , " my mother grumbled on the phone , when she 'd gotten the gist of how it was that Teddy had left me . I could feel her fidgeting on the other end , one hand buried deep in the pocket of her pleated brown slacks , the other squeezing the receiver . " That broad needs a good shot in the head , " she said . So rough my mother can be , like a moll in the Rat Pack . I wondered what my father was thinking as she said this . After I 'd shaved all those letters off my last name , my father stopped talking to me for a while . My mother never had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day I first breathed my new name into the dormitory phone . " Why not Steamroller instead of Plow , for the way you 've run over your father 's heart ? " " Ma , " I pleaded , but a cold silence whistled back at me through the wire . I could read her thoughts . Sideways , she was thinking . Everything half-assed and sideways . She has a mouth like a sailor , my mother . She 's tough , despite her slender body and pixieish face . She 's Donna Reed on drugs , Shirley Partridge with an attitude . She was forty-two when I was born . She 's seventy-four now and she still smokes . While my friends were having their nice seventies and eighties childhoods , I grew up in a fifties nightmare , with tuna casseroles and Jell-O molds where suspended things floated , with a mother who believed that Kraft Miracle Whip could be used in anything . Back in the fifties , according to my Aunt Sophie , my mother used to open doors for men . Heavy glass bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train station . She would swing them open violently with one thin arm , staring down boxy men in their thick-lapelled suits and ordering them through with a little half smile . " Go ' head through , " she 'd tell the men , and they went . They felt her eyes on their backs as they walked ahead of her . We all do . My mother stopped sending me care packages after I changed my name to Plow . No more home-baked cookies and Tetley tea bags . No more crackers with orange cheese that squirted like shaving cream from a can . She was outraged when the college sent home word of Roseanna Plow 's making dean 's list . My 3.8 grade point average meant nothing to her . She saw only the missing vowels and consonants . The next time I went home , I found my dean 's list certificate tacked up over my father 's workbench . Someone had put little carets between the letters of my truncated name , adding the u and the k and the ski . I knew it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a little chubby and I stood in the garage and saw how I had n't worked out for her , how she 'd wanted me to be everything she wasn't-better educated and yet submissive . It was a puzzling paradox , considering how I 'd been raised by this strong , proud woman , a woman men did n't fuck with , even back in the fifties . My mother calls my father Pulkowski , as in : " Pulkowski , crack me open a beer , " and " Come over here and light my cigarette , Pulkowski , " and " Pulkowski ! Put the kid to bed and watch the ball game with me . " Never an ounce of Cinderella in her , ever . How I wish I 'd been a bit more like her this past terrible year of my marriage , where Teddy 's back has been a cold marble wall dividing our bed in two . Even when my parents dressed up for a party , my mother smothering us in her cloud of Evening in Paris , wearing her wide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her red lipstick , even then , she 'd wink at my father in his good suit and say , " Nice threads , Pulkowski . Now help me with this goddamn zipper . " How I wish I could have ordered Teddy around with the same confidence ! Hold me in your arms , Stracuzza ! Kiss me , goddamn you ! The way my mother talks to my father dazzles me still and makes me jealous . The way he responds is the main reason I changed my name from Pulkowski to Plow . When I left home and heard my name aloud in other people 's mouths , I felt like my father being pushed around by Helen Pulkowski . I 'd hear someone say " Pulkowski " and there was my mother , cigarette dangling between her thin red lips , eyes twinkling seductively at her man . No article in Cosmo has ever , remotely , suggested my mother 's techniques for seducing a man . At ten to seven , as I 'm seasoning my sauce , I listen for the sounds of my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening , then the soft flopping of her jacket over the back of the couch . She 's arrived early , as she tends to do when she deems an event formal . She sighs , clears her throat , and finally calls her greeting . " Good evening , Madame Butterfly . " " I 'm in the kitchen , " I call from my steamy little corner , but my mother 's footsteps recede instead of moving closer . She 's heading for my bedroom . She 'll peek through there , open a few closets , maybe go through the medicine chest , searching for confirmation of Teddy 's departure . Soon enough she 's standing beside me with her thin wrists crossed , a cigarette caught between the fingers of one hand . She 's wearing a crisply ironed oxford shirt and blue polyester slacks . She 's studying me , looking for signs of damage . " Hi , Ma , " I say , looking up from the sauce . She nods once , like a store clerk . I feel her heated thoughts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 'll give him such a lump . I swirl my spoon around and around in the sauce , my wrist moving like I 'm rowing a boat . " What 's the matter ? You nervous ? " she says . " Give me the spoon , before you scrape a hole in the bottom of the pot . " She slips her cigarette into one side of her mouth before she pulls the wooden spoon away from me . " Move , " she says , knocking me lightly with her hip from my spot in front of the stove . Her Salem Light dangles over our dinner . " Ma , your ashes . . . , " I warn . " Yeah , yeah , my ashes . " She stares into the sauce . " Let me just tell you something , Miss Ashes . There 's no shame in your husband leaving if he was a nudnik to begin with . " " Ma ! " I say , grabbing the spoon back from her . We can only talk if we 're stirring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell the sauce . My mother snorts a little , stretches her open hands in front of her . " Teddy 's a putz , " she explains calmly . " And now he 's left you . Case closed . " I squeeze the spoon so tight my knuckles crack . Something about my Yiddish-speaking Catholic mother decreeing my husband a putz reminds me of another time . When I was a kid , she used to load me into the Plymouth station wagon and drag me off to Bascome Brothers Photographic Studio for an annual portrait . Mr. Bascome would seat me on a little mound of beige carpeting and then pull down screens behind me that looked like window shades with pictures on them . One moment , I was posed beneath the boughs of a cherry blossom tree . Then-a tug again-and there was a Christmas tree over my shoulder , a fireplace to my left . One last pull and I was floating in azure blue clouds , as if I 'd died and Mr. Bascome was photographing me now up in heaven . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my head and changed my world . This is what my mother did with her short , snitty proclamations , spelling out my life in her singular opinions . " Ma , " I say , still stirring wildly , sauce spilling over the sides of the pan , sizzling onto the range . " You do n't understand anything . " " I understand this , " she says , grabbing the spoon and pointing it at some imaginary chart that hangs above us . " Even Oprah does n't bother wasting an hour on My husband left me for my best friend ' anymore . It 's that predictable ! It 's that uninteresting ! It 's so " - my mother is pointing the spoon at me now- " beneath you , Rosie ! You went to college ! You were on the dean 's list ! " The sauce plops on my white tile floor like perfect drops of blood . " Your problems should be more educated than some putz leaving you for a bottle blonde . " " Ma ! Put the spoon down ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold techniques I 've learned in my work for keeping the autistic safe . I take a deep breath , try to restore calm in the room . " Everything is n't about TV ! " I cry . " I 'm sorry my problems are n't trendier , but did it ever occur to you that this separation might just be temporary ? " " Please ! " my mother snorts , and a cloud of smoke , or maybe steam , exits her mouth . " Ma ! " I yell , waving the dripping sauce spoon like a baton . " The point is you do n't know enough ! You ca n't call Teddy a putz if you do n't know enough ! He 's my husband . It 's my marriage . I decide who the putzes are . I decide . " I drop the spoon , reach above the stove into the cupboard , and start pulling out dishes . My mother is uncharacteristically silent beside me . I 'm pulling out the salad bowl when I feel her fingers gently pinching the exposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muses , " most women lose weight when their husbands leave . " " Ma ! " I whirl around , slamming the bowl down too hard on the countertop . " Hey , " she says . " Hey , hey , hey . " She pats me gently on my cheek . " It 's only a few pounds . " She runs her fingers through a thick tangle of my long hair . " You 're a beautiful girl , my Rosie , " she croons . " Look at you , with your father 's gorgeous chestnut hair . " She flicks her cigarette into the sink . I take a step back from her , give her my chilliest look . " I ca n't believe you are evaluating my life on an Oprah scale . " " It 's not on the Jerry Springer scale , that 's for sure , since you 've never hauled off and walloped the putz . Which I have wanted to do about a hundred times . . . " " Enough ! " I announce , running cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner now . " Something about my proclamation silences her . " May I set the salad bowls ? " my mother asks sweetly . We eat my mother-in-law 's spaghetti sauce in silence . After dinner , when my mother finally leaves for her 10.29-mile drive back to Commack , down the Veterans Highway , then a little ways west on Jericho Turnpike , I sit at the table and stare at the salt shaker . My mother is right , of course . Teddy is a putz . But he is the putz I married , four and half years ago . And marriage is a sacred thing . Even my mother believes this . I head for the refrigerator and uncork a half-full bottle of Pinot Noir . Is it really so wrong to try to work things out with my own husband ? I pour myself a nightcap , then pull out the Chips Ahoy ! from the cupboard . Helen Pulkowski , of all people , should appreciate the sanctity of marriage . I 'm scrubbing sauce off the range when I discover the wine bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself on the couch . I plump up the cushions before moving into the corner , shoes off , feet tucked beneath me like a sunbathing cat . I hum a little-the way I do when I 'm sort of loaded . I lift the phone receiver : white , lightweight , shaped like a bar of soap . I inhale deeply , exhale , and punch in the number . Eleven merry tones . The phone rings once , twice , and when I hear someone picking up , I almost slam down the receiver . But then I do n't . Why should I ? Who would wish to hurt me ? My best friend ? My husband ? Of course not . A second later , a female voice is speaking . " Hello ? " It 's Inga . I recognize her slightly whiny voice , the Olive Oyl tones that used to make Teddy and me laugh . Oh ! Popeye ! we 'd whisper , behind Inga 's back , then zip our lips again when she turned around . I hear myself giggling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying to control myself . There is not a sound from the other end . " Roseanna Plow , " I say . Now Inga gives a little sigh . " Formerly Pulkowski , " I go on . " Now Mrs. Stracuzza , " I hiss . " Are there any other Stracuzzas around I might actually speak to ? " I laugh merrily , like all of this is just good fun . I do this for Inga , my last little gift to her . " Roseanna , " she says , " it 's ten o'clock . " " Thank you , " I tell her , " for that update . " " Roseanna , " she says , " it 's late . " I squeeze the phone as if to throttle it . " Get him . " The phone clunks down like it 's been thrown . I rub my arm as though I 've been bruised . Someone 's put a hand over the receiver , so that they can talk about me without my listening . This is what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they treat me . So why have I called again ? What is the pretense , I mean . I know I 've called because my mother has planted this image in my mind of Teddy as putz , and I 'm anxious to be rid of it . But how could a phone call help ? Teddy is a putz . I slap my face lightly with my free hand . Focus ! What was the bogus reason for this call ? Teddy picks up the phone just as I remember . " Yes ? " he says , his voice so formal that I glance down at myself to see if I 'm completely dressed . " It 's ten o'clock , " he continues . " Your adulteress has pointed this out to me . " Coldness billows out of the little holes in my earpiece . I squeeze a mauve couch cushion , try again . " I 'm just calling to let you know that our Visa bill 's come in . " ( I love using this word our when I know she 's standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the phone and her cheek brushing his . ) I continue : " You know those sheets we bought for our bed at Macy 's last month ? " " Sheets you bought , " he corrects . " For our bed , " I point out . " Roseanna , " he sighs , " you 'd better start paying off the credit card expenses that are yours . Because I must inform you , I 'm closing those accounts . Visa , American Express , Discover . . . there 's another one , is n't there ? " He 's silent for a second . " Yeah . First Bank MasterCard . " " You 're closing them ? " I say . " What do you mean , you 're closing them ? You ca n't just close things . . . " " Roseanna , those are my cards . You can get your own cards . You have your own income . " He is referring to my work as a job counselor for the developmentally challenged and other handicapped workers . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of an income , not to mention a career , in the past . Moron management is what he 'd called it during one awful fight . Still , the money 's been steady , and Teddy has n't turned away a cent of it . And we 've always shared the cards , all of them in his name , all of them half-paid off by me . " Teddy , " I say . " Be reasonable . " My heart is squeezing like a sponge . " We 're married , " I say . " We 've got stuff together . Bank accounts . Cars . Sheets . " I 'm reciting the meat of our married life as though it 's a shopping list . " Now , I know you and Inga are having this . . . thing . . . right now , but we ca n't start dividing up our lives all of a sudden . We have to talk . . . . " I hear what I have just said and it stops me momentarily . Even through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am drunk-dialing a man who 's left me for my best friend . I sit up straighter , determined to end this unfortunate phone call immediately . " Roseanna , " Teddy says before I can do this . " There 's something I think you ought to know . Inga and I are buying a house . " Little bursts of light , like popping flashcubes , dance before my eyes . A house ? Has he gone mad ? He has a house , which I am sitting in right now . This is our house , or , at least our apartment . It 's the one we 'll move out of when we buy our own house , after Teddy makes partner at his law firm and I get pregnant . He 's promised me this , he 's promised me . " A house ? " I manage . Teddy is silent . I gaze around the empty living room , where everything is suddenly pink . The window , the door , everything . The inside of my brain is pink . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't buy a house with Inga ! You live here , in this apartment . You have a wife . . . " " Roseanna , " he says firmly . " I will speak to you again when you can be civil . " Clunk ! goes the phone , and I yell , " Goddamn you , Stracuzza ! " I yell it so loud , I think I see the individual fibers of my carpet shaking . But he does n't hear me ; he 's hung up . Just like a putz.
