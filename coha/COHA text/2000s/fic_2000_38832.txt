KATERINA , MY LAZY daughter , has just tripped over a tree root . She wo n't get up . She lies there , sobbing , pinned under her heavy pack like a rat caught in a trap . " Stop sniveling , " I tell her , " and stand up . We do n't have time for this . We have a lot of ground to cover before evening . " <p> " Ground to cover ? " she sobs . " You do n't even know where we 're going ! " <p> " We 're not going anywhere , " says Sofia , my spiteful daughter , fanning herself with her hand while she shifts from one foot to the other . " Nowhere at all , except on a wild goose chase of Mother 's . " She scowls at me and says , " There 's no witch at all , is there ? There 's no one out here who 's going to make us beautiful enough for the prince . just you , Mother : just a wrinkled , crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they thought I was the most beautiful woman in the world . I feel my eyes filling with tears , but I will not let my children see me cry . Sofia learned her spite from me . She learned it from hearing me mock that other one , my husband 's daughter . " So go back , " I tell her . I 'm an old woman who 's traveled as far as they have ; my back feels broken in two and my feet are one throbbing mass of blisters and I 've fallen too , today , more than once , and forced myself to get up each time . But then , I know what I 'm running away from , even if I do n't know where I 'm going . " If you 're so sure I 'm crazy , go home . " <p> " We ca n't go home ! " Katerina says , raising her head . One cheek is smeared with dirt ; twigs and leaves cling to her brown braids , and snot trails from her nose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action does little to improve her looks . " We do n't even know where we are . How can we go home ? " <p> " If you were smarter , " I tell the two of them , very glad they are n't , " you 'd have trailed rocks behind you , or bread crumbs . As it is , I suppose you 'll just have to stay with me . Anyway , you do n't want anyone back home to see you like this , do you ? As dirty and ragged as Ella 's ever been , with a mere day left before the Ball ? Ella gathering jewels and satin , and you two wearing mud ? That would make a fine picture ! " They glare at me ; Katerina starts to whimper again . I nod at them , satisfied , and say , " Sofia , help your sister . " <p> " You help her , " she says . <p> In the end , we both do . I grab one of Katerina 's arms and Sofia grabs the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaden sacks of meal , reluctantly upright again . I had to lie to get them to leave . I woke them at dawn , when I knew they 'd still be groggy and less inclined to argue . I 'd already packed food and blankets , and fresh water - safe in its wax-sealed jars - from the stream outside the cottage . <p> Katerina and Sofia did n't want to get up , of course , much less burden themselves with packs and set out into the forest . That was the kind of work we 'd always made Ella do . " When one of you is a Queen , " I told them briskly , " none of us will need to carry anything ever again . But for one of you to become a Queen , you must be more beautiful than Ella is . She has magic on her side : very well , we will enlist magic too . There is a witch who lives in the forest . She has promised to help us . But you must come with me now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the witch has said . " <p> My talk of magic roused them . We had all seen the birds fluttering around Ella , bringing her jewels and clothing . Katerina had tried to lure the birds with bread crumbs , but they only took her food and flew away , leaving nothing in return ; Sofia had tried to trap them with snares , but her traps always came up empty , the bait eaten . <p> I knew , and did not tell my daughters , why the birds only brought gifts for Ella . I knew - because Ella had told her father , who told me as we undressed for bed one evening , early in our marriage - that every day she prayed at her mother 's grave . The birds were heaven-sent , surely , for by all accounts , Ella 's mother had been a saint . I was not , and my daughters were not . Had they had any inkling that killing me and praying over my grave was the way to get lovely dresses , they might just have done it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor could I bear to admit that Ella 's mother , even in death , had more power to help her daughter than I had to help either of mine . Sofia and Katerina were not loving or obedient children , but they were the only ones I had , and they were my only route back to royalty . I was no longer young and beautiful enough to marry a prince ; one of my daughters would have to do so for me . Only then would all three of us be able to return to the ease and luxury we craved , far away from that cramped farmer 's cottage at the edge of the forest . <p> How we hated that cottage , all of us ! How glad we were that Ella was there , lonely and grieving , hardly able to fight us when we bullied her into service . How we jeered at her for living in the past , crying for her mother every evening instead of joining us in our cards and gossip , our sweets and scheming . I hated that dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never fill , the woman whose widower always loved her more than he loved me . And I hated myself , for marrying him merely to have a roof over my head and food on the table . <p> We 've stopped for the night , at last , after stumbling about the forest for hours . Every time I find a path that looks as if it might lead us out of the woods , to some other town or some other castle , it dwindles into thorns and dead branches , and I curse my own fear and foolishness . How could I have left with no idea where we were going ? How could I have left without even the simplest map ? <p> Sofia and Katerina stumble after me , alternately cursing and whimpering . " There 's no witch , " Sofia tells me . " You 're lying ! You do n't know where we 're going ! " <p> " The witch is testing us , " I tell them , and Katerina moans . <p> When we finally stop , just before dusk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build a fire , spread our blankets and pillows on the cold ground . Instead of thanking me for warmth and food , my daughters whine and complain . The ground is too hard and too rocky , and the fire is too smoky , and they want something hot to eat , some soup or some tea . <p> " Be quiet , " I tell them , for the thousandth time today . Every time I hear a rustle beyond our fire , my dread of wolves and bears deepens , but I say nothing to my daughters , lest they panic and desert me . " Think about living in a castle again , " I tell them . " That will be worth everything , wo n't it ? " <p> The old charm works ; they sigh in unison . I miss the castle , " Katerina says longingly . " I never had to lift a hand there , never had to wait for anything , for I had many servants , not just one , and they dared not disobey me . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I never had to learn to play , for my servants played for me , every moment that I was awake . Oh , when shall I be a lady of luxury again ? " <p> I do not answer . The servants who played music for her were those other two sisters , their eyes pecked out by birds , their toes sacrificed to the knife and the gleaming glass slipper . Unable to see , barely able to walk , they were fit only to play the harpsichord and the flute . Katerina will learn to play music soon enough , if I can find no other place for us . <p> " I miss the castle , " Sofia says bitterly , her eyes glittering . " I miss the parties where my gowns were always the most splendid and my jests always the wittiest . I miss dancing and flirting and seeing all the folk of the village pass through our halls . I miss my falcon and my fine steed ; I miss the thrill of the chase . Oh , when shall I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not answer . The music to which she danced came from the fingers of women once as worldly as Sofia ; she will be as blind and lame as they , if I can find no other place for us . <p> And the meat Sofia brought back from her hunts was cooked by the servant they have forgotten , the hag in the kitchen , forever minding the hearth . She is the one who handed her daughters the knife ; she is the one who told them to lame themselves . Thanks to her , I never dressed a roast after leaving my father 's house . But I will turn the spit soon enough , if I find no other place for us . <p> MY DAUGHTERS HAVE never known about my childhood , because I never told them . They have never known that I grew up in a cottage like the one we just fled , and that I spent those years doing endless chores . How could I tell them that I spent my girlhood scrubbing floors and peeling potatoes , weeding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them that once upon a time I was grimy and had no shoes and wept bitterly at the cruelty of my stepmother and her two daughters ? My pride could never bear that my own daughters learn my origins . And so they do not know that , once upon a time , I was the golden-haired girl in the kitchen , waiting and dreaming , rejoicing when love and magic came at last . <p> By the time Katerina and Sofia were old enough to have understood my story , even had I chosen to tell it , I had grown bitter and my prince , now the obscure king of an unimportant realm , had grown bald . No matter : there were music and dancing and visitors , a world for my daughters to conquer , although none left for me . I contented myself with ordering our servants about as I had once been ordered , and with grumbling because no good or faithful servants could be found . All the help left us , except those three : the blind , lame musicians and their mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her sight had dimmed , and whenever she saw me she reached out a wrinkled , gnarled hand and mumbled a curse , drool running down her chin . <p> The story circles back ahead of you : <p> Unless you stir yourself , you 'll stir the stew . <p> I told myself she was mad , and I did not mourn her when she died of the same illness that claimed her grieving daughters and , mere days later , my husband . Soon after that it claimed the village below the castle , the peasants whose rents had sustained us . Penniless and terrified of plague , I left the castle , setting out into the world with my two girls behind me . Soon enough , and far enough away for health , we met a kind farmer and his meek daughter , and soon enough I married him . <p> When did I realize that I was still living the same story ? I awake at dawn , feeling as if I 've hardly slept : rocks and sticks poke me in the back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillow I brought from home in favor of a pile of rotting leaves . My mouth tastes like dust and poison . I moan , raise myself on one elbow to check on Sofia and Katerina - still fast asleep , Sofia on her back with her mouth gaping open and Katerina on her stomach with her limbs flung out as if in flight - and gingerly force myself upright . I forgot to bring a trowel , and there is no outhouse here : I will have to make one myself . So I stumble into the undergrowth and find a clear spot and a branch to dig with , and as I crouch , doing what I need to do , I send up a fierce prayer : to God , to the spirit of that toothless hag in the kitchen , to whomever might hear me . I know where not to go . Now show me where to go . Show me what to do , damn you ! Even basting the roast would be better than this ! <p> As I emerge back into the clearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her blanket wrapped around her shoulders . Her hair is tangled ; a leaf pokes from behind one ear . " Well , Mother , " she asks coldly , " have you had a vision ? What joyous journey are we taking today , pray tell ? " <p> I want to tell her to journey wherever she wants , as long as it is far from me , but I hold my tongue . Sofia is more likely than her sister to marry a prince , since she possesses what passes for wit and looks more shapely in a busk . " We will continue the journey we began , " I tell her , and she snorts . <p> " I 'm hungry , " Katerina says , her voice muffled by the blankets around her face . " Mother , what 's for breakfast ? " <p> " Dreams and delusions , " Sofia says . " Our mother has gone quite mad , Katerina . There is no witch , nor ever has been . Do you know , Mother , I think you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're jealous . You could n't stand to see us being courted by noblemen when your husband is only a wretched farmer . What do you say to that ? " <p> I want to hit her , but I keep my voice calm . " I say this , Sofia : scoff at witches if you will , but Ella 's birds have brought you no gifts , for all your traps and tricks . When you perfect your own magic , you may scorn mine . " <p> " Brave words , " she says , and laughs , but Katerina , looking grumpy , pokes her head out of the blankets . <p> " Mother ? Mother , I 'm thirsty , and my water jar is empty . " <p> " Well , then , take another , " I tell her , but Sofia favors me with a thin smile , and when I check the water-jars I packed so carefully yesterday morning - years ago , it seems now - they are broken and empty on the ground , barren shards scattered among rocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste . <p> " You , " I tell Sofia , enraged . Stupid girl ! " You did this when I was sleeping- " <p> " Oh , Mother . I wanted you to have less to carry . Surely your witch will give us water - and if she does n't , why , we 'll just have to go home , back to the stream , wo n't we ? If we start now , we might even get back in time for the ball tonight . " <p> When did I realize that I was still living the same story ? <p> The day before we left , I ransacked the house , trying to find where Ella had hidden the gifts the birds had brought her , the jewels and fine clothing . I found nothing except Ella herself , chopping vegetables in the kitchen and cringing when she saw me , because she expected to be pinched . I stood there , watching her , smelling onions and carrots , and remembered how much I had loathed the same work when I was her age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a doorway like this one and glaring at me , just as I glared at Ella now , and quite suddenly I seemed to be standing in both places at once , and then there was a third figure there , too : the crone , the old woman with her singsong voice whispering her curse . The story circles back ahead of you ; unless you stir yourself , you 'll stir the stew . And at that moment I realized that she was my future , that old woman , just as the girl was my past , and with a shudder - for I had always hated and feared the crone - I realized that she had not been cursing me at all . She had been warning me . She had been trying to save me from her own fate . <p> And so the next morning , I ran , and took my daughters with me . But now we have no water , and we are lost , and I am afraid . For there is no witch to save us , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left ? <p> It should not be so hot in the forest , for hardly any sunlight reaches here , through the thick leaves above us ; below them , we are enmired in thorns and branches , through which we have struggled all day . I feel myself burning with thirst and fever , although I should not be so parched so soon ; behind me Katerina moans and sobs , and Sofia whispers continually , " Mother , take us home , Mother , there is a stream there . Home , Mother , home to water , home to the Ball . Mother , take us home . " <p> But I can not . I do not know the way . And so we hack through dry branches and tear our skin on thorns , and as we bleed our thirst increases , and I find myself wondering if my daughters could be any worse off having their eyes torn out by birds than they are now , here , with me . Katerina plucks at my arm with a burning hand , begging me to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Sofia says hoarsely , " We must have water . Mother , we must . Mama , I 'm thirsty ! " <p> And even though she is the one who spilled the water out , something stirs within my ribcage when she calls me Mama , for she has not called me that for years , not since she was tiny and I sang lullabies while cradling her in my arms . " Mama , I 'm thirsty too , " Katerina moans , and I remember her voice waking me at night , although my husband the king always snored on soundly . Mama , I had a bad dream . Main a , I 'm thirsty . I want water . <p> My daughters . My babies . I must find water for them . I take another step and another , pushing aside dead branches , fighting for my daughters ' lives and my own . And at last the thorns clear away ; we stand in a circle of grass now , and there , look , across the grass : berries . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squeeze half the juice into Sofia 's mouth , half into Katerina 's . Their mouths gape and they beg wordlessly for more , and I pick handfuls and handfuls of berries until my daughters are sated . <p> And now I must have juice too : but there is none left . I have picked all the berries for my children , and surely I will die . I shudder and begin to weep , the first tears I have cried in front of my daughters since their father 's death . " Mother , " Katerina says , plucking at my sleeve , " Mother , I hear water ! " <p> And Sofia pushes me , urging , " Just a few steps . Here is the stream . A few more steps and you can drink , Mother , Mama - " <p> I stumble forward in a daze , peering ahead . Yes : here is a stream at last , a stream like the one we left behind , a stream like the one we crossed to get away from the cottage , to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have tricked me . They have led me back to the cottage , and we will go to the Ball tonight after all , and nothing will change . I will hand them the knife , and the birds will peck their eyes out . They will become lame and blind , musicians for the king 's daughters , and I will become the hag in the kitchen , and all three of us will die , unshriven , of fever . <p> And now they are pulling me into the water , my two girls . They are pushing my face down and they are going to drown me , I know it ; but I am not drowning I am drinking instead , drinking and drinking until I must burst . When at last I raise my head , I see that Katerina and Sofia have crossed the stream ; they are on the other side now , walking away from the banks , toward that place that looks so familiar . <p> " Come back ! " They must not go there . They must not go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want them to be blind and lame ; I do not want them to suffer . That is not why I dragged them through thorns and squeezed berries for them ; that is not why I braved the darkness and the beasts that live within it . <p> " Come back ! " I call again , but they do not even turn . And I realize , stricken , that I must tell them the truth : I have no other weapons now . If I tell them the story , maybe they will come back . If I tell them the story , maybe I will be able to save them . " Look at me , " I shout at their retreating backs . " Look at me , your ugly mother do you know who I am ? Look at me . " <p> And at last they turn , wide-eyed , astonished by my violence . " I 'm Ella , " I shout at them , " I was Ella , forty years ago I was beautiful too , oh , damn you - " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself now or at them , at Ella scrubbing pots in her father 's kitchen or at the crone , stirring the stew by my husband 's hearth . Tears blind me as I wade across the stream , desperate to rescue them , desperate for some sign that everything I have done , everything I have lived through , has not been in vain . <p> But when I set foot on the opposite bank , emerging onto this place where I know I have stood before , it is not the cottage I see , but a grassy mound , surrounded by fruit trees and topped with a simple cross . I hear birdsong , and I hear Sofia saying , " Mother , whose grave is that ? " And I remember . <p> I came here every day after she died , because I hated my father 's new wife . I came here every day , and every day the birds brought me gifts : flowers , fruit , small things that cheered me . Every day I prayed : Mother , Mother , help me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that mean woman and her daughters . Oh , Mother , I miss you . And so the birds began to bring me jewels , and stuff for a fine gown , and indeed I got away , all the way to the castle . I got away , and I buried my memories as deeply as my own mother was buried , nay , more deeply even than that . Fleeing the bad , I left the good behind as well . <p> I fall to my knees . I remember her voice now , before she died . " Your eyes are more beautiful than dancing flames , " she told me , " and your heart is more precious than ruby or pearl . You are my own treasure , no matter what you wear and no matter what you become . " And I believed her , and with that spell I enchanted both myself and the prince . <p> " Thank you , " I say aloud . I thank my mother for showing me what I could become and I thank that other mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not want to be . " Thank you . " <p> " Is this the witch ? " Sofia asks , puzzled . " The witch who 'll make us beautiful ? " <p> " She 's dead , " Katerina says , frowning . " This is a grave . I do n't understand . " <p> " Yes , " I tell them . I am more tired than I have ever been in my life . " This is the witch . And she 's still alive . Everything is going to be all right . " And as I speak there is a flutter of wings overhead , and something falls into my lap : a feather , brown and soft . <p> All three of us look at it . When I touch it , it becomes a small pile of seeds . <p> " They are n't jewels , " Katerina says . <p> " No , " I answer . <p> Sofia grunts . " What are they for ? What does the witch want us to do with them ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and above us , the birds break into a jubilation of song . <p> We eat from the fruit trees and drink from the stream , and then we sleep . I wake at dusk to find Sofia and Katerina plucking at me . " Mother , " Katerina says , her voice hopeless , " we 're missing the Ball . And we are n't beautiful yet . " <p> " You 're missing nothing , " I tell her , shaking myself awake . <p> " Mother , " Sofia says sadly , " are we ever going home ? " <p> " We are home . We 're home now . Come , help me build a fire . " <p> They help me , although I know it is only because they are afraid of the dark . They are both weeping now , grieving their lost chances . They huddle around the fire , and I let them cry . " I 'm ugly , " Katerina keens , rocking herself by the fire , " ugly , ugly , I have no beautiful clothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirty , and oh Mother , I 'm too fat , my hair 's too brown , no one will ever love me , Mother , Mother . " <p> " I love you , " I tell her , and take her in my arms and stroke her rough brown hair , that hair she hates so . " When you were born , my sweet first baby , you were as red and wrinkled as a raisin . You were bloody and howling and hungry . You were n't lovely , but you were alive and you wanted to live , and to me you were the most beautiful thing I had ever seen . And you still are . Only your sister is as beautiful to me as you are , of all the creatures in the great wide world . Your brown hair is the color of ale , of nuts , of solid sheltering wood : you are all healthy , merry , sturdy things . I love your strong body because it will carry you through all trouble and illness , through hardship , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What of me , " wails Sofia , as she rocks herself , sobbing , " what of me , I 'm not fat and healthy , Mother , Mother , I 'm as skinny as a pole and my knees are two knobs and my hair is coarse and black , Mother , Mother , no one will ever love me . " <p> " I love you , " I tell her , and take her in my arms and stroke her thick dark hair . " When you were born , my sweet second baby , I thanked God for you , because I had been ill when I carried you and I was afraid you would be born ill too . You were red and wrinkled as a raisin , and much smaller than your sister had been , but you howled hungrily because you were alive and wanted to live . I knew then that you were tough and strong , for all that you were little , and that your strength would carry you through any trial life could offer . Only your sister is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the creatures in the great wide world . Your black hair is the color of the plucky crow , of deep midnight which always contains within it the promise of dawn , of the pitch that holds homes together : all tough , tenacious , surviving things . " <p> And as I speak , I find that I believe my words , as fully as my own mother believed in my own beauty . My daughters stop crying and shiver , gazing into the flames . " Mama , " Sofia says , " how can we be home ? How can we live here ? What prince will have us ? " <p> " We will build a house , " I tell her , " and we will have each other and ourselves . " I know she does n't understand me , but I also know that if we give ourselves to princes , we will find ourselves living their lives , not our own . <p> " Mama , " Katerina says , " what will we eat , and how will we cook it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We will garden and hunt , " I tell her . " The forest will sustain us , and we will work to sustain ourselves . I will learn how to work again , and I will teach you , for work is not such a terrible thing , my Katerina . " <p> I know she does n't understand me ; she still dreads struggle . But I also know that when we cease our efforts , we give away our lives . And I will not teach them to do that . I will not watch their eyes be pecked out , and I will not hand them the knife and tell them to cut off their toes . My daughters are not expendable : not for this story , or any other . <p> And neither am I. <p> At length they fall asleep again , embracing each other as they have not done since they were babies . I look toward my mother 's grave , toward the cross dimly glimmering there in the firelight . I am still afraid , for now we are well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tomorrow we must begin to chart a new wilderness , a place without paths : the unknown regions of a story that has never yet been told . <p> Author Affiliation
