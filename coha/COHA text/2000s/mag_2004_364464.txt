One casualty of the war in Iraq and the way it has dominated the nation 's attention is President Bush 's legislative agenda . Nearly all his initiatives have either stalled or run into trouble in Congress . His immigration-reform initiative , which would give illegal immigrants guest-worker status , appears to be going nowhere . Conservatives spurn it as a reward for illegal activities , while liberals complain that it does n't go far enough . A welfare-reform bill , which would toughen work requirements , got caught in a tussle over whether to raise the minimum wage . Meanwhile , even with gasoline prices rising , the energy bill that was once a top priority for Dick Cheney is now limping along ; some Democrats are trying to break it up to pass the salvageable parts , like measures aimed at preventing another blackout . The one major bill that has moved through both houses lately  --  a measure to expand and repair the nation 's highways  --  is in trouble with the President himself . He 's called both the House and Senate versions too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Bush opponents , who say the Administration is too scattershot and is n't working hard enough to get bills passed . " They just seem to have trouble keeping their attention on one bill , " says Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle . Administration officials , in response , point to such Bush legislative successes as the Medicare prescription-drug benefit and a bill imposing additional criminal penalties on those who harm fetuses while committing certain crimes . The President will continue to push for his legislation , but White House officials recognize that , with the election approaching , it wo n't get any easier .  --  By Matthew Cooper
