Musculoskeletal injuries are one of the most frequently encountered problems in pediatric practice , with fractures accounting for a surprisingly large percentage of these injuries . A fracture occurs when bone is subjected to more energy than it can absorb . Pediatric healthcare providers must have a good understanding of normal bone growth and development and must recognize common mechanisms of injury and fracture patterns seen in children . Nearly 20% of children who present with an injury have a fracture , and it is estimated that 42% of boys and 27% of girls will sustain a fracture during childhood ( Wilkins , 1996 ) . The immature skeleton has several unique properties that directly affect the management of fractures in children . <p> The vast majority of pediatric fractures can be treated successfully in a closed manner and do not require surgery ( Figure 1A-C ) . However , pediatric Healthcare providers must he aware of potential problems that can arise when treating these fractures and must be able to recognize the young patient that may be a victim of nonaccidental trauma or child abuse . Nurse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a thorough understanding is essential . This three-part series will review basic orthopaedic anatomy as well as the diagnosis and management of common pediatric fractures . Part I will include a review of anatomy , early development/ embryology , fracture healing , and recognition of nonaccidental trauma ( abuse ) in children . Part II will review the diagnosis and management of several common pediatric upper extremity fractures . Part III will review the diagnosis and management of several common pediatric lower extremity fractures . Teaching strategies and guidelines that will enable the advanced practice nurse to educate parents , families , and other healthcare providers caring for these young patients will be reviewed . Review of Anatomy <p> To correctly diagnose pediatric fractures , the healthcare providers must understand common terminology and anatomic landmarks . A subtle difference in the anatomic site of a fracture or injury often has a major impact on acute treatment and potential long-term complications . The major anatomic regions of a growing bone include the epiphysis , physis ( growth plate ) , melaphysis , and diaphysis ( Figure 2 ) . The epiphysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long bones ; it is separated from the rest of the bone by the cartilaginous physis . At birth , each epiphysis is completely cartilaginous , with the exception of the distal femur . Throughout childhood , secondary centers of ossification form and enlarge until the entire cartilage skeleton has been replaced by the bone . The multiple physes ( which are radiolucent on X-ray ) and un-ossified epiphyses in young children can make fracture identification quite difficult ( Eiff &; Hatch , 2003 ) . <p> Bony tenderness in a child with open physes is the hallmark sign of a growth-plate fracture even if X-rays appear normal . The metaphyseal region is at the end of long bones ( the contoured flare at the end ) , and the diaphysis is the central shaft of the bone . The most common fractures in children occur in the upper extremity at the distal radius ( wrist ) , elbow ( supracondylar ) , and clavicle ( collarbone ) ( Landin , 1997 ) . Most fractures occur when the child sustains a fall while playing . However , the incidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the school-age and adolescent population . Embryology and Early Development <p> Skeletal development occurs through a process known as osteogenesis or ossification . Just 26 days after fertilization , the upper limb begins to take form as a slight elevation on the ventrolateral body wall . The lower limb bud appears 2-3 days later , just caudal to the umbilical cord . Between the fifth and eighth weeks , the limbs begin to extend and take on a definite shape ( Dietz &; Morcuende , 2001 ) . Bone growth , however , is more complicated than simple elongation or enlargement . Most long bones add width on the outside by a process referred to as subperiosteal apposition ( layers added to those already existing ) , while losing bone on the inside by endosteal resorption ( breaking down and reabsorbing material ) . The majority of the skull bones and the clavicle develop through intramembranous ossification , in which the bones are formed directly from an embryonic tissue known as mesenchyme . All other bones in the body , however , develop by endochondral ossification . In this process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then gradually replaced by bony tissues . Endochondral bone formation occurs at the physis and is responsible for the elongation of long bones . Once all of the physes are fused ( become bone ) , longitudinal growth is complete . Differences in the Pediatric Musculoskeletal System <p> A child 's musculoskeletal system is different from that of an adult in several important ways . These differences gradually diminish with age , so that fractures in adolescents are generally similar to those in adults . The most obvious difference between immature and mature bones is the presence of a physis or growth plate . Injury or fracture of the physis constitutes approximately 20-25% of all skeletal injuries in children ( Eiff &; Hatch , 2003 ) . It is important to recognize physeal fractures because they can adversely affect subsequent growth . There are several different classification systems for physeal injuries ; however , the simplest and most widely used method of classification is the Salter-Harris system . Fractures involving the growth plate are divided into five categories based on pattern ( Figure 3 ) . The system classifies physeal fractures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I and II do not cross the epiphysis and will rarely cause a growth arrest disturbance . Salter-Harris III , IV , and V fractures have a higher incidence of growth alteration . Type II fractures ( metaphysis into the physis ) are the most common and represent approximately 50% of all growth-plate fractures in children ( Peterson , 1996 ) ( Figure 4 ) . The most common growth disturbance after a physeal injury is a premature partial arrest of growth . Complete growth arrests may result in significant limb length inequality , while partial growth arrests more commonly cause angular deformities . The most important factor affecting the likelihood of developing a growth arrest is the severity of injury to the physis . In general , fractures that involve the growth plate should be referred to a pediatric orthopaedic surgeon for definitive management . It is important to educate the family/parent early in the course of management about the possibility of growth disturbance following a physeal injury . They should be advised of the likelihood of growth disturbance ( based on the Salter-Harris classification and severity of injury ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth-plate fracture , and that consistent follow-up is necessary to monitor the bone growth ( Eiff &; Hatch , 2003 ) . <p> An immature bone also has the ability to bow rather than break in response to force , which can lead to torus or buckle fractures , which are extremely common in children ( Figure 5A and B ) . This type of fracture is not seen in the adult population . In a buckle fracture , stability of the bone is maintained , and casting is done mainly for patient comfort . The metaphysis is a point of decreased strength in the bone and is a frequent site of buckle fractures in children . A force applied to the side of a long bone may disrupt one cortex while merely bending the other to produce a greenstick fracture . This type of fracture always should be referred to a pediatric orthopaedic specialist because it is notorious for causing angular deformity and requiring closed reduction and/or manipulation . <p> Ligaments and tendons are usually stronger than immature bones . Therefore , fractures are more common sprains in young children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ femoral physis fracture , whereas an adult may sustain a collateral or cruciate ligament injury of the knee given the same mechanism of injury . Another key difference in the immature bone is that there is a thicker , more vascular , and stronger periosteum ( outer covering of the bone ) . The thicker periosteum in children is much more resistant to disruption and often imparts a certain degree of intrinsic stability to a fracture . The periosteum is also more metabolically active in children . The increased metabolic activity contributes to more rapid healing and remodeling that is commonly seen in young patients with a fracture ( Staheli , 2001 ) . A disadvantage of healing in young children is that displaced fracture fragments become immovable much earlier than in adults , which necessitates earlier treatment . <p> Fractures in children generally heal much more quickly than those in a skeletally mature adolescent or adult . The growth plate and periosteum allow for faster healing and shorter immobilization limes . Delayed union and nonunion are rarer occurrences in children . In addition , pediatric patients tolerate casting and immobilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complications . Physical and occupational therapy is generally not needed following uncomplicated cast treatment of fractures in children . <p> The normal process of bone remodeling can correct malalignment , making near-anatomic reductions much less important in children than in adults ( Figure 6 ) . The remodeling process requires a functional physis ( growth plate ) and infact periosteum . Remodeling of the bone results from appositional periosteal formation on the concavity of the deformity , resorption on the convexity , and asymmetrical physeal growth ( Murray , Wilson-MacDonald , Morscher , Rahn , &; Kaslin , 1996 ) . Angular deformity in the midportion or diaphysis of long bones is usually not acceptable and will not remodel very well . In children under the age of 8-10 years , angulation near the joint or growth plate is much more acceptable and has greater potential for remodeling . The age of the child , the distance of the fracture from the growth plate , and the amount of angulation are the primary considerations when deciding on appropriate management . Healing of Fractures : General Principles and Guidelines <p> Fracture healing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fracture healing is initiated very shortly after the injury occurs , with bleeding , inflammation , and swelling . During the reparative stage of fracture healing , the bone ends become joined and stabilized . The cells of the body that are capable of changing into bone cells ( pleuripotential mesenchymal cells ) are activated and start laying down new bone ( soft callus ) . Greater subperiosteal hematoma and stronger periosteum in children contribute to a more rapid formation of callus ( healing bone ) . Strong periosteum is vital to fracture healing in children and should be preserved as much as possible . Large segments of bone will often regenerate and remodel as long as the periosteal sleeve is left intact ( Price , Phillips , &; Devito , 2001 ) . The soft bone is then replaced by harder woven bone ( Einhorn , 1996 ) . Perhaps the most unique property of an immature bone is its capacity to remodel over time . The potential for remodeling depends on the number of years of growth remaining , the proximity to the physis , the magnitude of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to adjacent joints ( Perona &; Light . 1990 ) . The end goal of fracture healing is to have a bone that is , in the child 's words " as good as new . " Red Flog : Fractures of Abuse <p> Because child abuse or nonaccidental trauma is a potentially lethal condition , pediatric healthcare providers should consider this possibility in every infant/young child who presents with a fracture . In 1962 , Kempe and colleagues introduced the phrase " battered child syndrome " ( Heller &; Kempe , 1968 ) . They helped bring much-needed multidisciplinary medical attention to the problem of child abuse , which led to mandatory reporting laws that now exist in all 50 states . Some studies have shown that majority of fractures in infants , less than 1 year of age , are caused by physical abuse , and that a significant percentage of fractures in children under 3 years of age is the result of abuse ( Cramer &; Greene , 1998 ) . However , not all fractures in the first 3 years of life can be attributed to abuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year of life , McClelland and Heiuple ( 1982 ) found that 44% of fractures were from documented accidental and nonabusive etiologies . Recognition of abuse is extremely important in order to protect the involved child as well as any siblings from further injury or abuse . When the diagnosis of abuse is missed , recurrent injuries occur in about half and are lethal in 10% of infants and children ( Staheli , 2001 ) . Although all children are at risk for maltreatment and abuse , first-born children , premature infants , stepchildren , and children with learning or physical disabilities are at greater risk . Lower socioeconomic status is perceived to be an increased risk factor for child abuse ; however , this may be due to underreporting in middle- and upper-income families . It is important to remember that child abuse is a problem that crosses all age , sex , ethnic , and socioeconomic groups ( Capelleri , Eckenrode , &; Powers , 1993 ) . Child abuse is also more common in families in which the parents are involved in a violent interpersonal relationship . Adults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become abusive parents . Other vulnerabilities for abuse are lack of social support , drug or alcohol abuse , or mental illness of the caregiver . <p> It is the responsibility of all healthcare providers to report any suspected cases of child abuse to the appropriate agency . In fact , it is now legally mandated that all healthcare providers report any suspected cases of abuse to the slate ( appropriate agency or child protection team ) to allow them to investigate the suspicion . Other mandated reporters include teachers , school counselors , social workers , daycare providers , babysitters , and law-enforcement officers . Submitting a report indicates that child abuse or neglect is a possibility ; it does not represent a definitive diagnosis . Healthcare providers who report a case of suspected child abuse in good faith are protected from legal action or lawsuits . Pediatric healthcare providers should recognize the physical signs of child abuse . Some of these signs include bruises , swelling , scars , welts , or burns over any part of the body . Whenever evaluating a child with a musculoskeletal injury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possibility that the injury was not accidental . The healthcare providers should obtain a detailed history of the event and must assess for any signs of evasiveness , vagueness , or changing details of the circumstance of the injury . <p> Although there is no predominant fracture pattern in child abuse , certain types of fractures should raise suspicion . For example , a child presenting with multiple fractures in different stages of healing , femur fractures in pre-ambulatory children ( younger than 12-14 months of age ) , corner or " chip " fractures of the metaphysis around the knee ( distal femur ) , skull or rib fractures , scapula fractures , and ulna " nightstick " fractures ( midshaft ) should alert providers about the possibility of nonaccidental trauma ( Figure 7 ) ( Pressel , 2000 ) . <p> The role of imaging in cases of child abuse is to identify the extent of physical injury when abuse occurs , as well as to exclude other possibilities of alternative diagnoses . A skeletal survey should be considered in l he evaluation of a young child who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pediatrics ( AAP ) ( 2000 ) has published detailed recommendations for diagnostic imaging in cases where child abuse is suspected , A skeletal survey is the preferred radiographic study and is considered standard for all children younger than 2 years of age with a suspected nonaccidental injury . A bone scan is a useful complementary study and is often used as the principal imaging tool beyond 1 year of age ( Nimkin &; Kleinman , 2001 ) . <p> In summary , abuse should be suspected and appropriate investigations initiated when the injury , clinical history , or the findings on diagnostic imaging studies suggest the possibility of child abuse or nonaccidental injury . The investigation may be distressing to the parents and the families ; however , it may also be the difference between life and death for a young child . ( Patterson , 1998 ) . Conclusions/Major Points <p> Fractures are very common in pediatric patients and occur when the bone is subjected to more energy than it can absorb . The major anatomic regions of a growing bone include the diaphysis , metaphysis , physis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pediatric fractures include the presence of a physis ( growth plate ) , the ability to bow rather than break through cortex of bone ( torus/buckle fracture ) , thicker periosteum ( outer covering of the bone ) , faster and more successful healing ability , and the great potential for remodeling .
