<p> With fears of anti-American terrorist attacks being revived because of ongoing violence stemming from the U.S. war against Iraq , several top NBA players who have been named to the U.S. Olympic team are having second thoughts about representing the United States in the 2004 Summer Games in Athens , Greece . <p> Players such as Karl Malone , Jason Kidd , Jermaine O'Neal , Tracy McGrady , Kevin Garnett and Allen Iverson are n't directly voicing their fears about terrorist attacks . They would prefer to use fatigue , injuries , family and personal problems as reasons for withdrawing from the team or declining invitations . <p> Lakers star Kobe Bryant perhaps has the most legitimate reason . He withdrew because of the uncertainty of his future . He will spend the summer fighting rape charges that could put him in prison for life . Others can claim injuries . <p> The U.S. found out in 2002 what can happen when it does n't send its very best players to international competition . A pretty good team that included Paul Pierce , Elton Brand , Baron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished sixth in the 2002 FIBA World Championships in Indianapolis . That finish required the United States to qualify for the Olympics , which it did by going undefeated ( 10-0 ) in last summer 's Americas tournament in San Juan , Puerto Rico . But several NBA players charged that security was lax in Puerto Rico , suggesting it may not be much better in Athens . <p> We are concerned about security for all our athletes , and we will do all in our power to make them as secure as possible , " NBA operations chief Stu Jackson said . Unlike in Puerto Rico , where the players were kept in a hotel , in Athens they will be housed in the Queen May II a luxury liner docked in the bay . It will be well-guarded . " <p> Outspoken Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban echos concerns of other owners when he opposes having his best players risk their health and his investment in them in international competition that has nothing directly to do with his franchise . The NBA , on the other hand , simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world and send its best . Unfortunately , the NBA 's best are the world 's highest-paid and most precious athletes . <p> In a current Sports Illustrated survey listing the world 's 50 richest pro athletes , 24 were NBA players . Younger and less expensive players like Amare Stoudemire , Shawn Marion , LeBron James , Dwyane Wade , Ben Wallace and Ron Artest could still win a gold medal under Pistons coach Larry Brown , who will be running the team . But although the U.S. team had the most talented players in that FIBA tournament two years ago , they did not mesh well enough to play the best team basketball . So they lost . <p> Ben Wallace <p> A scout 's view of the Detroit Pistons ' 6-9 starting power forward : Here is one of the greatest success stories in NBA history . Here is a guy who was not drafted by anybody . He made it into the NBA because of his tremendous athleticism . Then he worked hard to make such a productive role player out of himself that he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regularly among league leaders in rebounding and shot-blocking and has made the last two All-Star teams . In his rookie season he averaged just 1.1 points and 1.7 rebounds . But he has improved in all areas the last seven years . This season he averaged 9.5 points , 12.4 rebounds , 3.0 blocked shots and 1.8 steals . His main positives are his brute strength , his extraordinarily quick , adhesive hands and his tremendous jumping ability . But under Pistons coach Larry Brown , he has developed a reliable jumper within 12 feet and also has become a better passer . <p> tipping off <p> " Everybody should be a Ginobili fan . He does whatever it takes to help his team win . He makes an imprint on the game . A lot of guys play without leaving an imprint . Ginobili always leaves his . ... He may be wild , but he has a great understanding of the game .

Mission accomplished . <p> Their second concern was the availability of their MVP for the season , Kobe Bryant . Mission uncertain . <p> A May 27 hearing has been added to the sex-assault case against Bryant , and either Game 4 or 5 of the Western finals will be scheduled for that night . If the Lakers are playing in Minnesota , it would be more difficult for Bryant to make the hearing and get to Minneapolis for a 7:30 p.m. game . <p> Lakers coach Phil Jackson marvels at how well Bryant continues to play while commuting from criminal court to basketball court . <p> " Kobe 's ability to let what 's gone by stay in the past and what 's at the present be the moment and live in the moment is an experience that you see on the court , " Jackson said . " That 's really the wonderful lesson that he gives us watching him play . He 's undaunted by what happened 8-10 hours earlier . He can let that go and be completely playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play this game with . " <p> THE RILEY PRINCIPLE : During his 21 years of NBA coaching , Pat Riley was feared and revered as the most rigorous physical fitness taskmaster in the league . His players would be in tip-top shape and would post 19 straight winning seasons with superior execution and stamina . <p> Although he has resigned from coaching the Miami Heat and remained as team president , coaching successor Stan Van Gundy retained Riley 's conditioning philosophy . It has paid off . His team of limited basketball talent simply outworks most of its opponents . <p> " A lot of people , I think , were scared because they heard of that grueling workout program and things like that , " newcomer Lamar Odom said . " It 'll do nothing but make you better . It makes us tougher as a unit . It makes us feel like we can get through anything . I do n't see why someone would n't want to come and live in Miami for six months .

In the East , 57 percent picked the New Jersey Nets to advance to the Finals and 19 percent picked the Indiana Pacers . <p> The grapevine <p> *If the Lakers go all the way this season , expect 40-year-old starting power forward Karl Malone to announce his retirement .

He says he wants to pursue other options . The Knicks will still be paying him for two more seasons anyway . <p> 2-2 Numbers game <p> For the first time in NBA history , all four conference semifinal playoff series were tied 2-2 after four games , making a powerful statement confirming competitive parity within the conferences . Although the Indiana Pacers ( 61-21 ) had the NBA 's best record , the champion is still expected to come from the West for a sixth straight season .
