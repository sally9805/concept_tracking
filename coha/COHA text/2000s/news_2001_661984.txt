<p> Amid the grim accounting of the dead and injured from the airborne onslaught that toppled the World Trade Center and blasted the Pentagon , authorities said Wednesday they believed the terrorists had had other targets - the White House and Air Force One . <p> " We had specific credible information that both were intended terrorist targets , and that the plane that hit the Pentagon may have been headed for the White House , " said Sean McCormack , spokesman for President Bush 's National Security Council . <p> The revelation came on a day when investigators pursued leads to Canada , Massachusetts , Florida and beyond , spurred by the horrors that continued to unfold in the ashes of New York and suburban Washington . <p> The financial capital remained closed after the attacks . Federal officials partially lifted a ban on air travel , allowing flights that had been diverted on Tuesday to finish their journeys and empty planes to be moved around . All other flights remained grounded . <p> On Wednesday morning , Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said there were 41 known deaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead - and 1,700 known injuries . He said 259 uniformed officers , including police and firefighters , remained unaccounted for . <p> " The best estimate we can make is that there will be a few thousand ( victims ) left in each building , " he said . <p> The mayor said rescuers were in contact with one person buried in the rubble . Three police officers and a woman had been taken alive from the wreckage , Giuliani said . <p> Authorities gave reporters their first close-up look at the site , and this is what they saw : Only about seven stories of the north tower remained , its girders bent outward . The south tower was a two-story-high heap of rubble . <p> Progress was slow . Cranes and heavy machinery were used , but only gingerly , for fear of dislodging wreckage and harming any survivors . Searchers with picks and axes worked slowly , too - sometimes when they opened pockets in the debris , fires flared . <p> President Bush declared the attacks " acts of war . " He said he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation . <p> The announcement that the White House was believed to be a target explains why Bush did not immediately return to Washington from Florida on Tuesday to take charge of crisis operations run from the White House basement . Instead , he went to Louisiana and Nebraska before returning home . <p> The focus of the investigation was on Islamic terrorist Osama bin Laden , who denied involvement , though he " thanked Almighty Allah and bowed before him when he heard this news " of the attacks , according to a Palestinian journalist . <p> But sources told The Associated Press that investigators were looking into the possibility that four different terrorist cells were involved . <p> " This could have been the result of several terrorist kingpins working together . We 're investigating that possibility , " one law enforcement official said . <p> Attorney General John Ashcroft said authorities who reviewed intelligence had " numerous credible leads . " <p> FBI agents searched a room at the Westin Hotel in Boston 's Back Bay ; they said the room was vacant , but they found information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hijacked flights . They would not identify the man . <p> Law enforcement officials were said to be looking at possible bin Laden supporters in Florida . They were aided by an intercept of communications between his Florida supporters , and harrowing cell phone calls from victims aboard the jetliners before they crashed . <p> A Venice , Fla. , man who was interviewed by the FBI said agents told him that two men who stayed in his home while training at a local flight school were the hijackers . Charlie Voss said the agents identified the men as Mohamed Atta and someone known as Marwan . <p> The FBI in Miami issued a national bulletin for law enforcement agencies to look out for two cars . Records with the Florida Division of Motor Vehicles show that one of the vehicles the FBI was pursuing - a 1989 red Pontiac - was registered to Atta . <p> Federal officials , speaking on condition of anonymity , also said they were investigating whether one group of hijackers crossed the Canadian border at a checkpoint and eventually went to Boston 's airport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center took off . <p> Tuesday 's assault on American government and finance led the president to place the military on its highest state of alert . <p> Smoke still drifted from the ravaged Pentagon , and authorities said they did not expect to find more survivors . <p> The government went back to work Wednesday , its political leaders , diplomats and soldiers leaving no doubt the terrorist assault will be answered . " We will go after them , " Secretary of State Colin Powell vowed . <p> The Navy said the aircraft carrier USS George Washington was in position Wednesday off the coast of New York . The United Nations was evacuated for a time Wednesday morning after receiving a threat . <p> Americans remained on alert . Baseball 's major leagues canceled all games scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday . And Les Dorr , a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman , said passengers could expect tough security measures at reopened airports , suggesting that they arrive two hours early for flights . <p> At Boston 's Logan Airport , aviation director Tom Kinton said the FAA is requiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including : banning the sale or use of knives , including plastic ones , at the airport ; evacuating and sweeping all terminals with K-9 teams ; increasing security personnel ; increasing ID checks ; and discontinuing curbside check-in . <p> On Tuesday , as workers poured into Wall Street , a hijacked jet tore through one of the 110-story twin towers . Another followed , striking the other tower in a fireball 18 minutes later . By 10:30 a.m. , both towers had collapsed in horrifying clouds of gray smoke . <p> A third jet struck the Pentagon at 9:40 a.m . A fourth hijacked airliner plummeted to earth about 80 miles southeast of Pittsburgh . There was speculation that the hijackers intended to take the plane elsewhere but were thwarted by passengers . <p> In a phone call from the air , passenger Thomas Burnett told his wife , Deena , " I know we 're all going to die - there 's three of us who are going to do something about it . " Then , Burnett told his wife , " I love you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priest , the Rev. Frank Colacicco , told the San Francisco Chronicle . <p> The final death toll may not be known for weeks . The four planes alone had 266 people aboard . Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said the estimates that 800 had died at the Pentagon were probably too high ; sources said 100 military men and women were missing . <p> In New York , firefighter Rudy Weindler spent nearly 12 hours trying to find survivors and only found four - a pregnant woman sitting on a curb and three others in the rubble of a building in the trade center complex . <p> " I lost count of all the dead people I saw , " Weindler said . " It is absolutely worse than you could ever imagine . " <p> U.S. officials said the attacks were carried out with military precision . Like Burnett , a few people on the hijacked planes managed to make cell phone calls , in which they said terrorists armed with knives were taking over the jets . <p> The planes were each on cross-continental routes , and thus carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings high up and on the corners , stymieing firefighters ' ability to contain the blaze and blocking escape for some tenants . <p> Three top fire department officials were among those who died . One of them , Ray Downey , chief of special operations command , led a team of New York firefighters to Oklahoma City in 1995 after the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building . <p> The 1,350-foot-tall towers , which withstood a terrorist bombing in a basement parking garage in 1993 , were reduced to a pile of stone and steel . A hazy , brownish-gray cloud was all that could be seen where the gleaming rectangular towers used to loom . <p> On Wednesday morning , the smell of natural gas and the sound of portable generators hung over the site . A coarse , sawdust-like powder - pulverized concrete , insulation and paper - made it hard to breathe without a mask . It covered the streets with a gray blanket , inches thick . <p> Tons of paper documents lay everywhere . Expense accounts , jotted memos and ledger sheets covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body parts by the thousands , " said Angelo Otchy , a mortgage broker who came in with a National Guard unit from Dover , N.J. , to help dig through the debris . <p> Normally 50,000 people work in the twin towers , but the first attack came when many workers were not yet in their offices . Officials estimated that 10,000 to 20,000 people were in the buildings when the first plane crashed . Many fled , rushing down dozens of flights of stairs before the second jet hit and the towers collapsed . <p> Much of lower Manhattan , a center of world finance that includes Wall Street and the stock exchanges , was cordoned off . Every aspect of daily life in the city was disrupted , from phone service to subways . <p> The Empire State Building - along with schools and many offices - was closed Wednesday as a city filled with world-famous landmarks came to grips with its vulnerability . All they had to do was look at the gap at the lower end of Manhattan , once filled by two massive towers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not identify , reported that authorities had seized a car at Logan Airport that contained Arabic-language flight training manuals . The source said five Arab men had been identified as suspects , including a trained pilot . <p> At least two of those men flew to Logan on Tuesday from Portland , Maine . Gov . Angus King said the two men apparently were using New Jersey driver licenses but little else was known about them . They left behind a rental car that was impounded in the Portland area . <p> The luggage of one of the men who flew to the airport Tuesday did n't make his scheduled connection . The Boston Globe reported the luggage contained a copy of the Quran , an instructional video on flying commercial airliners and a fuel consumption calculator .
