The King of Saudi Arabia , Abd-Al-Aziz ibn Saud , had authorized a team of American engineers to explore the trackless desert bordering the Persian Gulf , an arid landscape marked only by the occasional palm-fringed oasis . He hoped they would find water . A tribal leader with precarious finances , Ibn Saud believed the Americans might discover places where he could refresh his warriors ' horses and camels . But the team , from Standard Oil of California , had something else on its mind . Oil had been discovered in other countries in the region , and the engineers thought they would find more in Saudi Arabia . Over several years , they drilled more than half a dozen holes without result . In desperation , they decided to dig deeper at well No. 7 . They plumbed to a depth of 4,727 ft. and finally hit what would turn out to be the largest supply of crude oil in the world . <P> The King did not appear to appreciate the news fully at first . It was an entire year after the discovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 400 automobiles at the pumping station of Ras Tanura to witness the first tanker hauling away its cargo of Saudi crude . Henceforth the King would no longer rely for income on the pilgrims arriving in Mecca , Islam 's holiest city . And his kingdom 's petroleum wealth would emerge as a crucial factor in Middle East politics and the bargaining over global energy supplies .  --  By Adam Zagorin
