Start with our at-home treatments and then , if needed , call in the reinforcements . In no time , you 'll be set to strip off the layers with confidence . THE PROBLEM : KERASIS PILARIS Rough , bumpy skin on the backs of your upper arms , butt , and thighs is the hallmark of this very commonand completely harmless-condition . Although keratosis pilaris ( KP ) looks like tiny pimples , it 's actually a buildup of dead cells around individual hair follicles , says Mary Lupo , MD , a clinical professor of dermatology at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be treated but not cured , KP frequently-and inexplicably-improves during the summer and sometimes even gets better with age . AT HOME Regular use of a body scrub , which sloughs dead cells from the skin 's surface , can help rub out the problem within a couple of months . To keep follicles from replugging , use a lotion with an exfoliator such as retinol , salicylic acid , or alpha hydroxy acid daily , suggests Anne Chapas , MD , an assistant clinical professor of dermatology at New York University School of Medicine . Look for one that 's also formulated with urea , a moisturizer that softens the toughest of skin . IN OFFICE Microdermubrusion , a treatment that uses tiny particles to lightly sandblast the top layer of skin , leaves you noticeably softer and smoother . You 'll see a significant improvement in KP after two or three weekly treatments , which run about $150 each . If residual redness persists , intense pulsed light therapy-which uses high-intensity pulses of light to target pigment in the skin-may help destroy the redness that creates the polka-dot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll probably need at least three sessions . The pain is bearable , and any subsequent irritation fades within a few days . THE PROBLEM : CHERRY SPOTS Good news : These bright red spots ( cherry hemangiomas , in medical speak ) are harmless . Bad news : They tend to grow in number and size with age-though they rarely become larger than a pencil eraser . Exactly what causes cherry spots , a proliferation of capillaries that commonly appear on the chest , stomach , and back , is a mystery , says David Duffy , MD , a clinical professor of dermatology at the University of Southern California . They are , however , thought to be hereditary . AT HOME There 's no effective overthe-counter treatment for cherry spots , but concealer can help camouflage them . Duffy recommends using a heavy-duty opaque cover-up , such as Classic CoverMark ( $22 ; cover markufsa.coni ) . If your skin tone is fair to medium , applying self-tanner or dusting on bronzer can also reduce the color contrast between the spots and vour skin . IN OFFICE A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body-with the pulsed dye laser ( PDL ) , which zeros in on blood vessels to knock out redness . Although you 'll shell out $100 to $300 a PDL session ( two or three are recommended ) , the results are worth it : In a 2001 study , cherry spots improved in 97% of those treated , and 14% saw their spots vanish entirely . Expect some slight stinging and minimal bruising that lasts a few days . THE PROBLEM : STRETCH MARKS Like a rubber band that eventually snaps when pulled too far , stretch marks occur when the skin is extended to the breaking point . Usually the result of a pregnancy or dramatic increase in weight , the unsightly streaks appear when collagen ( which supports the skin ) and elastin fibers ( which provide elasticity ) break apart . Technically considered scars , stretch marks-which most frequently appear on the abdomen , hips , and breasts-initially look pink or purplish and may be slightly raised . With time , they usually assume a thin , sunken appearance and fade to white . AT HOME If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to red nee wrinkles , it may help ever so slightly to dab some on your stretch marks as well-especially if they 're less than 6 months old . " Retinoids help form new collagen and elastin , which can make stretch marks more similar in appearance to your normal skin , " says Duffy . According to a University of Michigan Medical Center study , 80% of patients with fairly new stretch marks treated with a retinoid cream for 6 " months saw the length of their marks decrease by an average of ' ' 14% and the width by 8% . You can also try retinol , the less-potent retinoid available in OTC cream . " It 's definitely worth a try , but the best results are seen on newer stretch marks , " says Duffy . IN OFFICE Consider a new laser treatment called Fraxel , which stimulates collagen production by heating the lower layer of the skin . In a yetto-be-published study of 18 patients conducted by NYUs Chapas , five Fraxel treatments at 2- to 3-week intervals were found to fade even old stretch marks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very thin beam of infrared light that makes thousands of microscopic wounds over only 20% of your skin-the surrounding tissue is left untouched . This " fractional " approach allows the skin to heal much faster than if the entire area were treated at once , says Roy Geronemus , MD , a clinical professor of dermatology at NYU Medical Center . It also means that side effects-including pain-are minimal ; mild swelling and redness subside in a few days . The drawbacks : Each treatment costs about $500 , and up to five sessions are necessary to see optimal results . THE PROBLEM : SPIDERVEINS These weblike clusters of red , blue , and purple streaks , each about the width of a hair , affect about 50% of women . Spider veins , or telangiectasias , are dilated capillaries that become visible because they 're situated so close to the skin 's surface . Though the exact cause is unknown , risk factors include hormonal changes from menopause and trauma to the skin , such as bruises . Women who spend a lot of time on their feet are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces the capillaries to fill with blood ) , as are those who habitually cross their legs or are even a few pounds over their ideal body weight . at home DIY solutions include covering spiders with heavy-duty concealer ( a quick fix if you only have a few to hide ) or applying self-tanner to minimi/e the contrast between your skin and the colorful vessels . To prevent them , avoid prolonged periods of standing or sitting . Another smart move : wearing tight-fitting support stockings , which decrease pressure that accumulates throughout the day . IN OFFICE A dermatologist can exterminate spider veins with a simple " lunchtime " procedure called sclerotherapy , during which a solution is injected into the vein via a very fine needle . The solution irritates the lining of the vessel , causing it to swell and stick together and eventually collapse in this closed position . Over a period of weeks , the vessel turns into scar tissue that 's absorbed by the body , becoming barely noticeable or invisible . Though not an instant fix , sclcrotherapy-which does n't require anesthesia-usually clears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or four monthly treatments , says Huffy . Discomfort is minimal and includes some stinging at the site of injection and possible muscle cramping that subsides after about 15 minutes . Cost : $250 to $750 per session , depending on how many squiggles you have . THE PROBLEM : INoOWN HAIRS After shaving or waxing , the curly hairs in your bikini area sometimes get trapped inside the follicle or grow back into the surrounding skin , causing painful , red , pimplelike " bikini bumps . " AT HOME Gentle use of a body scrub or washcloth every other day will help dislodge trapped hairs and prevent their return . I1Or a chronic case , try a product such as Tend Skin , which contains an exfoliant that keeps bumps at bay by eliminating the dead cells that hinder hair from growing out of the skin . Then dab on a pimple medication containing benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid to reduce inflammation and stave off bacteria that cause infection , says Cindy Barshop , owner of Completely Bare , a New York City-based spa that specializes in hair removal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your doctor for a prescription-strength antibiotic lotion to kill bacteria and a steroid cream to quell swelling and redness . If you 're especially prone to bikini bumps , consider laser hair removal , which makes them a thing of the past ( for more information , see below ) . 6 THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT LASER HAIR REMOVAL 1 . LASERS WORK BEST ON DARK HAIR AND LIGHT SKIN : The light is attracted to color , so it wo n't be as effective on white , gray , blond , or red hair . The treatment is most effective on the bikini line and underarms . " The average woman has coarser , thicker , darker hair in those areas , and that 's what is needed to be highly successful , " says Deborah S. Sarnoff , MD , a clinical associate professor of dermatology at NYU Medical Center . 2 . YOU NEED MULTIPLE TREATMENTS : Hair cycles between two dormant phases and a single growing phase , and only hairs in the growing phase will be receptive to the laser 's zap . As more hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one a month for 5 months . Studies show that a series can reduce hair counts by up to 75% , with results lasting as long as a year or more before a touch-up is necessary . 3 . YOU DO N'T GET INSTANT RESULTS : " It can take a week to 10 days for treated hair to fall out , " says Sarnoff . Unlike waxing , you do n't have to grow out hair for several weeks prior to lasering-a little stubble is all that 's needed to attract the light . 4 . IT CAN HURT : The treatment 's gotten less painful thanks to cooling tips on the laser and the use of topical anesthetics but can still feel like rubber bands snapping your skin . 5 . THERE CAN BE SIDE EFFECTS : The most common are changes in pigmentation , either a lightening or darkening of the skin . To minimize risk , have the treatment done by a physician or physician-supervised technician , advises Sarnoff. 6 . IT 'S STILL NOT CHEAP : Prices have dropped considerably over the years , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or chin to $1,500 for the bikini line .
