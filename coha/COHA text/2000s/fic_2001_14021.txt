( Lights come up slowly to reveal a very spare , very plain , almost somber backyard on a low hillside that might be a bit more vivid looking in spring or summer , but is very grey and chilled looking on this faded November day . There are two old-fashioned wooden lawn chairs that appear to have weathered several winters in the yard . There might be a bare clothesline or a garden hose , swirls of fallen , dead leaves , but any plants that might have bloomed earlier have been turned brown by a killing frost . ) ( Everything is cold and damp . ) ( A single figure is alone in the unrelenting grey light . This is LEN . He is leaning against one of the chairs , staring out at the faded , dreary valley in the distance . Though the air is frigid , he is wearing no coat , only a suit . His tie is undone . We can see that he is cold , but he still does n't move . ) ( In the distance there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roar of a passing truck . A mill whistle . Len does not react . ) ( At the far side of the yard , another figure suddenly appears . This person is bundled up in layers of sweaters , a down vest , heavy work boots , heavy gloves , a dark watch cap pulled low . There are cardboard placards tied around the person 's chest and back , which we soon see are picket signs . The person walks briskly , purposefully , not noticing Len . ) ( Hearing something , Len turns , sees the figure , and immediately reacts . ) LEN Hey ! Hey ! Get out of here ! Go on ! Get out of this yard ! Goddamnit , get the fuck out of here ! ( The other person finally notices Len , removes the watch cap to reveal earphones under the cap . The person removes the earphones . We soon see that the person is a woman , CELIA . Her hair has now fallen loose . She stares at Len. ) p. 3 CELIA Sorry . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuck off  --  CELIA Okay . Okay . I 'm going . ( She starts off , then stops : ) Len ? Is that  --  Len ? LEN Yeah . What do  --  CELIA It 's Celia . Celia . LEN Really ? Celia ? CELIA Hi . LEN Hi . CELIA How are you ? I mean . I was sorry to hear about your  --  LEN It 's okay . CELIA Your father never seemed to mind when I took a shortcut across the backyards so  --  well , I did n't think anybody 'd be here . Sorry . LEN No . No . It 's fine . I just thought  --  vandals or something . Neighborhood kids . There 's been some crime lately . That 's what I was told . I really do n't know . CELIA You 're all right ? LEN Yes . CELIA Funeral all over ? LEN Yes . It 's all done . ( She unbuttons her jacket and peels it and the picket signs off , fans her face a moment with the signs. ) p. 4 CELIA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beat ) So the funeral  --  was  --  nice ? I mean , you 're doing all right ? LEN Yes . CELIA Going to sell the house ? LEN What ? CELIA House . Gon na sell it ? LEN I  --  well , I do n't know . I guess . CELIA Maybe you could rent it . To a family . You know . LEN Would n't get much for it . CELIA Well , people ca n't afford to pay much these days . There 's not much work . Not since the mills closed . I mean , there 's work . A little at GM . Some out on the Interstate . Cleaning motel rooms . Mechanic at the truck stops . But  --  not much of anything else . So people ca n't afford much . But you could rent it . LEN Not worth the headache . CELIA I hate to see you give it up . LEN Why ? ( Beat ; she looks at him a moment . He says nothing more . ) CELIA Well . Cold out here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back inside . p. 5 LEN Uh . No . That 's  --  that 's okay . CELIA ( beat ) Talked to your dad last week . He was pulling out the purple mums he had over there . In the corner . Frost got them . LEN Oh . Yeah . CELIA Putting in bulbs , too , I think . We talked . He was always interested in what was going on down at work . So we 'd talk once in a while . Who retired , who 's getting married , who 's being a son of a bitch . You know . LEN Uh-huh . CELIA He seemed fine . LEN It was sudden . So . You 're on the line then . CELIA Yep . I put the buttons in Chevy pickups . When I 'm not laid off . Which is more often than not . Let me give you a piece of advice . Do n't drive an American car . Probably built by someone who had a six-pac for lunch . LEN I do n't . CELIA Wait . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German . CELIA ( beat ) You look really cold . You want this jacket ? ? LEN No . Thanks . p. 6 CELIA I do n't need it really . Got about six layers on . Just needed it when I was standing around . LEN No . CELIA You ought to go inside . LEN Uh . I need the air . CELIA Oh wait . Wait . I 've got something to warm you up . ( She pulls a pint of cheap bourbon out of her jacket pocket . ) I took this off Bob Castro on picket duty . LEN Bobby ? Bobby Castro ? He 's still around ? CELIA Oh sure . Where would he go ? Ten o'clock in the morning and he 's downing major alcohol after God knows how many shots he had before he even showed up . I thought , fine , get drunk , who cares , but not with a picket sign glued to your front , you know ? I mean , I think it looks bad . People think you 're picketing for more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle ) Go ahead . Have a swig . Warm up . Gon na get pneumonia , standing around out here . ( Len reluctantly drinks from the bottle . ) LEN You 're on strike ?  --  or  --  I mean , I did n't hear about a strike . CELIA Just an informational picket . Some of the groceries want to cut their checkers back to a few bucks over minimum wage . Hiring non-union . The usual pattern . p. 7 LEN Oh . So you get stuck standing there in the cold , huh ? CELIA Once in a while . That 's life . My life . LEN So Bobby 's still raising hell . CELIA Oh yeah . Making himself miserable . As usual . ( Len takes another drink , hands Celia the bottle . She drinks and hands the bottle back . ) LEN Good ole Bobby . Here 's to you , B.C. ( Len looks out across the yard , down into the valley , takes another drink . ) God , this place is a pit . CELIA Oh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much cinder block . I mean , have you ever been anywhere where you 've seen so damned much cinder block . Cinder block houses . Cinder block garage . Cinder block liquor store . Cinder block church . Streaks of greasy soot melting down the sides of the cinder block . The strip mine 's better looking than the main drag . This is an armpit place . This is a nightmare place . This is somebody 's idea of a very bad joke : build a town to resemble a missile testing site in Nevada . It 's not even that interesting actually . CELIA Nevada 's warmer . LEN Look at that . Lawns shaved within an inch of their life . Stunted little bushes , one here , one there , no flow to the branches , just regimented little rows of ugly little shrubs . p. 8 CELIA Yep . Cracked driveways . Greasy bricks . LEN Beer signs . Beer signs . How could they go out and find the ugliest rattiest beer signs in American and hang them up . I 've seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colors . Everything 's the color of rust . CELIA Rust and motor oil . LEN Even the trees . Even the leaves . All the color of dead rust and dirty oil . Everything 's dead . Everything 's decayed . CELIA Everything 's old . People are old . LEN Well , at least there are n't any hulks of ancient rotting Buicks or godknowswhat lying around up on blocks . CELIA Look again . LEN Huh ? CELIA The Chesters ' yard . Look again . That 's half a Fairlane . LEN Jesus Christ . All rotting . CELIA The valley was carved by glaciers . It 's ancient . It wants to return to its primitive form . So it starts to consume things , oxidize . One day everything here will be a pile of iron ore . LEN The sooner the better . CELIA Could be . Could be very soon . Cast the beer signs out . Sprout a tree . p. 9 LEN Never happen . CELIA Return to the forest primeval . Trees the shape of men with gnarled arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distorted scary faces . CELIA Scary only to those who ca n't see . Bonfires lit by unknown beings , burning silently at clearings in the woods . LEN Oh I see , I see , to replace the furnaces of the mills . CELIA Uh-huh . No cinder blocks . LEN No beer signs . CELIA No orange plastic drums full of highway sand . LEN No ugly stuff . Nothing that was n't at least once alive . CELIA No . LEN We should celebrate it . A toast . ( He hands her the bottle . She drinks . Then he drinks . ) LEN What 's that noise ? Trucks from I-80 coming too close ? CELIA Probably a freight train . Oh . It 's the bass . LEN What ? CELIA My headphones  --  Just the bass . I forgot to turn it off . p. 10 LEN Let me have that . ( He puts on the earphones , messes with the knobs . ) CD  --  radio  --  here we go , Rock'n'roll classics . The Doors . Oh . Here 's grunge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dance music . CELIA What is it ? LEN I 'll lead . You guess . ( He pulls her toward him , starts dancing . ) CELIA It 's a slow dance . LEN And she 's bright , too ! CELIA How am I supposed to know what we 're dancing to ? I ca n't hear it . LEN Watch me . Hint : oldies , but goodies . Super oldies . I mean super super . CELIA Red Sails in the Sunset . LEN No . CELIA Harbor Lights . LEN What is this with the boats ? And the 1950s music ? CELIA My father has a collection . Um  --  Since I Fell for You . ( He looks at her a long time . ) LEN Jesus , Celia . You were my best girl . First love . CELIA You , too . p. 11 LEN It 's so good to see you . CELIA Yes . LEN I ,  --  uh  --  usually ca n't stand to come back here . You know ? Ca n't stand to look at the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong , then I come back , and it feels even worse . And this time  --  well . It 's just so good to see you . CELIA I know . LEN God , you know , you , you deserve better than this , you know ? You should be somewhere else , somewhere that is n't dying right in front of you . You look lost here . CELIA Maybe some people get lost when somebody they counted on leaves them behind . LEN What 's that supposed to mean ? CELIA Look , sorry , let 's just drop  --  LEN Fuck , are you serious ? So I 'm the reason you 're stuck here , huh ? Fuck that ! I 'm the reason your life did n't work out ! Me ? That 's great . That 's fucking terrific ! Great . Yeah . Good . Blame me . Go ahead . I 'm used to it . Yeah . CELIA Oh stop it , Len . LEN No ! No . I get it . You 're one of them , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for wanting something , for going after something , for leaving them behind . I go to college  --  I 'm sorry ! I go to law school  --  yeah , I 'm sorry ! I do n't buy my dad a new house ! I 'm not here to fix his car , I 'm sorry ! I 'm fucking sick of it ! I 'm sick of apologizing for being who the hell I am . What does everybody want me to do , drool and walk with a limp ? Will that make everybody happy ? Will that even up the odds ? I 'm not drinking myself to death like Bobby Castro , I did n't drop out of college like you , I do n't live in a house with the back porch falling off . I 'm guilty . Fuck it . I 'm sick of it . p. 12 CELIA Will you shut up ! LEN Go ahead . Lay it on me , Celia . Tell me how I abandoned you and ruined your life . CELIA Nobody ruined my life but me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No wait a minute . Wait a minute . No , you just stop . Stop it . Oh Jesus , what am I saying ? My life is n't ruined . What 's wrong with me ? This is my life . It is n't ruined . I chose it . I chose it . Hear that ? LEN I counted on you , Len , I 'm lost cause of you , Len . CELIA I did n't mean that . I did n't mean it . Shut up . Okay , I said it , but I did n't mean it . I did n't . ( Beat ) Look . I was just angry at you . I 've been angry . And that came out . I  --  I did n't expect you to carry me along with you all your life . I 'm not mad you left . I 'm  --  I  --  I was just  --  was mad cause you did n't even say goodbye . I never got a kiss goodbye . That 's all . That 's all I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) This is such an ugly place , Celia , I hate to see you h  --  CELIA Oh . It 's ugly . Sure . But one thing about an ugly place : an ugly place never expects too much out of you . Ugly place lets you know who you are . Ugly place does n't make you feel you are n't fit to live there . And when something good turns up in an ugly place , you do n't have any trouble noticing . Do n't have trouble recognizing it at all . ( Beat ) I chose to be here . You did n't . That 's all . Len . That 's all . Honest . p. 13 LEN Celia . ( Len pulls her close to him and kisses her , a long kiss . She responds . They stand there a moment , in each other 's arms . ) ( Finally : ) CELIA It 's cold out . You 're just wearing this light jacket . LEN Oh . Yes . CELIA Do n't you want to go in ? Len @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go of her , steps away . ) LEN Uh . No . The air . Uh  --  no . ( She nods her head ; gathers up her things ; their moment has passed . She turns to go , heading across the lawn . ) CELIA Oh . By the way . Where are you living now ? LEN Uh . Sonoma . CELIA California ? Oh . Where they make the wine ? LEN Yes . CELIA Oh . ( Beat ) Must be very pretty . ( She gives him one last look and turns to go . The lights fade on Len alone in the yard. )                                                                                @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
