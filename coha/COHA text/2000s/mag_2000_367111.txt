Visions of the 21st Century <P> The arrogance shown by your theorizing about the future of space and science VISIONS 21 , April 10 was staggering . Who can say what discoveries will be made in the next 25 years that will fundamentally alter our perception and understanding of the universe ? Time and again , history has proved we are not as clever as we think we are . DEREK RAMM Toronto <P> Congratulations ! Finally a major publication has taken the giant leap into the outer world , answering the great challenge of the new millennium . It is incumbent upon Americans to show the way . So that all humanity can benefit , we must take the leadership role as explorers , pioneers and innovators in seeking new worlds . " Up , up and away ! " should be the new battle cry . GEORGE H. GEORGERIAN Haverhill , Mass . <P> In the future will we be able to live on Earth ? Be able to explore one-zillionth percent of the universe ? Be able to provide water for all people ? Morally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LANGENDONCK Heverlee , Belgium <P> One more mind-boggling question : Will we ever get a TIME magazine with complete pagination ? LIBOR BROM Barrington , Ill . <P> ... Will we still exist ? ERIC BERNHARDT Kindhausen , Switzerland <P> Thank you for a most entertaining and imaginative issue . One of your articles addressed the question " Will We Discover Another Universe ? " I am a big believer in alternate universes as an explanation for lost items . Somewhere in a parallel universe , another Alan Perlman is scratching his head and wondering why the devil he suddenly has three identical brown belts and two CDs of Bill Evans at the Village Vanguard . ALAN M. PERLMAN Highland Park , Ill . <P> The exploration and mining of resources in space are hugely important to the future . There are literally millions of asteroids containing material and energy resources floating in our solar system just for the taking . We need to appreciate the energy resources within our reach if we merely look up . WILLIAM HUBBELL Buenos Aires <P> In this newborn century  --  in which accumulating evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own included , are continually created and die  --  your cosmic analysis can be summed up with some very brief words : What a lot of crap ! JAMES C. RITCHIE Glasgow <P> New Sources for Energy ? <P> In your article " will Someone Build a Perpetual-Motion Machine ? " VISIONS 21 , April 10 , you stated that the theories of inventor Joseph Newman are " considered nonsensical . " Having assisted Newman in his work for 17 years and edited his book The Energy Machine of Joseph Newman , I find your assessment to be inaccurate . A special master appointed by a U.S. district court found overwhelming evidence that a prototype of Newman 's invention showed that " the output energy exceeds the external input energy . " Newman 's discovery has extended the law of the conservation of mass-energy into a new electromagnetic domain . Such extensions of natural law into new domains are typical in the history of scientific progress . Newman has produced a revolutionary electromagnetic technology for the 21st century .
