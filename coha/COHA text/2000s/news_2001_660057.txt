<p> Rebecca , Helen , and John , three teenagers from Sudan , were glued to the television , something they 'd seen for the first time only a few months ago . I wanted to talk with them , so to break the ice , I grabbed an inflatable globe that was on the floor and showed them where I was from , pointing to the northwest corner of Oregon , and pointed to where they 're from , southern Sudan . I told them I 'd grown up on a farm , hoping to find some common ground . They just stared at me . This was n't going to be easy . I had come to visit the recently arrived Sudanese refugee siblings to see how they were adjusting to life in their new country . They , however , did n't seem to want anything to do with me . Which is understandable , given what they 'd been through . Rebecca , Helen , and John are just three of the more than 400,000 Sudanese refugees , according to the UN High Commissioner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 million of their countrymen have died , many of them Christians , as the country 's Islamic government has been locked in a civil war with Christians and animists in the south . The Dinka ( the group to which these teens belong ) and Nuer tribes have been devastated by the fighting , with families being torn apart . The result : thousands of uprooted kids . The children banded together in the late 1980s and roamed hundreds of miles over the searing sands of Sudan , Ethiopia , and Kenya - avoiding bombs , soldiers , and wild animals . Lions picked off stragglers , malaria attacked others . But to John , the war is not about military factions or government policies . " They the ruling class are brown . We are black , " he says , staring straight ahead . " They want to kill all who are black . " These teens were part of a group referred to as the " Lost Boys " of Sudan - about 12,000 boys , along with a handful of girls . They ate whatever they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You just eat it , " John says of their limited diet . " It keeps you from not to die . " In 1992 , most of the children arrived at Kakuma , a refugee camp in Kenya , a " city " of about 33,000 refugees . Finally their lives had some stability . Still , it was far from normal because the camp lacked security . Residents would wake up to find neighbors slaughtered outside their huts . There was no way , the three teenagers said , to find the culprits . " We could not sleep comfortably , " Rebecca says quietly of their six years in the camp . They talked matter-of-factly about that part of their life and showed no emotion . I , however , had knots in my stomach hearing the horrors they went through . They still have nightmares about life there . Unexpected noises at night - like one evening when their American foster mother hung pictures on the wall - still startle these light sleepers . When Rebecca heard the pounding , she was afraid to leave her room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , " John says the people at Kakuma told him , " and we do n't care about the camp . " Still , camp workers gave them photographs of friends taken in the camp , " so we would n't forget , " Rebecca says . " They block a lot of things out , " says Pam , their new foster mom , whose last name - like the teens ' - is withheld because of privacy regulations by the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service , which is overseeing the refugee resettlement . " They do n't want to think about it . They just want to move on . " Pam , a Sunday school teacher and single woman who works for a high-tech company , opened her doors to the three siblings after reading " White Oleander , " a book dealing with foster care in America . While the first wave of refugees left Kenya Nov. 6 , John , Helen , and Rebecca made it out in late December . They - along with 3,600 to 4,000 other refugees - were granted resettlement rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the UNHCR , made the decision , given the impossibility of resettlement in war-torn Sudan and the fact that Kenyan officials would not allow the children to resettle there . After a long , bewildering plane ride , the trio arrived at Boston 's Logan International Airport to a world that looked like it had been buried in frozen sugar . " We asked Pam what is the problem , " John says . " She said it came from the sky . " To combat the cold , one of their first tasks was to pick out clothes donated by the Division of Social Services . Pam told them to take what they liked , and the rest would be given to other refugees . But they hesitated , concerned about making sure the new Sudanese kids were well dressed and had enough - a trait burned into them from years of sharing the little they had . Adjusting to life in America after years in a developing country has been no easy task . Everything is so new to them they do n't bother asking what it is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We do n't know the names , but we just eat it , " says Rebecca . " They 're very good at finding things out , " Pam says . The alarm clocks by their beds were mysteries . So they read the instruction manuals to figure out how they worked . They wondered if they were going to eventually eat the pet guinea pig and were leery of toothbrushes . They were n't sure such new implements would clean their teeth as well as the sticks they used from a particular tree in Africa . In many aspects , they are not like the stereotype of typical American teenagers : They mop the kitchen floor without being asked and clean the bathroom . After a recent trip food shopping , the girls put away the groceries without prompting . Another difference : their remarkable politeness toward strangers . For lunch one day , they poured a steaming stew over rice and included me in their meal . John made me lip-curlingly sweet tea , a sign , says Pam , that he was warming to me ( she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week ) . Before lunch I had wandered upstairs to talk with the girls about their Dinka language . They were more than willing to teach me the lilting , gulping language . Soon , the cloud of awkwardness that had hung over the room dissipated . I watched how they pronounced the words , but it did n't help ; my mistakes delighted them , especially the throaty sounds . Helen buried her face in a pillow , gushing with laughter . Rebecca could n't stop giggling . Now that we had loosened up , they cranked up the battered audiotape they had brought from Africa . " Who 's this ? " I ask . " Koffi , " answers Helen . " Have you heard of him ? He 's from Zaire . " The girls started dancing , throbbing and singing to the music . What had been an awkward exchange had just turned into a frolicking party . Dancing at home is one thing , dancing at school is quite another . At a recent school dance , the girls waved off interested boys . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , her nose ring twinkling . " I just dance with Helen . " " We do n't dance like that in Africa , " John chips in . Only a few of the Sudanese refugees have been girls , and that means frequent phone calls from refugee boys . When the phone rings , Rebecca answers . She giggles and sprints for her room just like an American teenager . The phone calls from all over the the US have been so frequent , Pam got the teens their own phone line . John , quiet and pensive , often comes up with the most insightful answers and questions . Pam was concerned when he first arrived because he was withdrawn , always watching TV and not talking much . When they went out to McDonald 's , John sat at a table by himself while the girls gabbed and ate hamburgers with Pam . During a reunion with other refugees , he talked with no one . But at times , it 's as though a window cracks open and Pam sees into his world . He asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and how the school system in America works . Before his first day of high school , he asked Pam if kids smoked cigarettes at high school . When she said not everyone did , he seemed relieved . Out of the blue one day , John asked me if the blacks on TV are American . I explained to him that their ancestors were African , but I 'm not sure how much he absorbed about American slavery . Yet this sometimes-brooding boy surges with vitality , and it 's evident that US culture is seeping in . Television , America 's great " acculturator , " has its grip on all three . They are fond of the Discovery Channel , the Cartoon Network ( they love Tom and Jerry ) , and Black Entertainment Television ( BET ) . But some things continue to shock them . Helen recoils when she sees near-naked women on BET and does n't understand why women wear such tight pants in the United States . " We do n't like these fashions , " she says . John sings along to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wow , a 13-year-old rapper ( but admits he ca n't understand all the words ) . While in the grocery store lingering over the magazine rack , he points out Jennifer Lopez on the cover of " In Style . " While the kids assimilate into American culture , Pam slowly glides into motherhood . She melts when they call her Mom , and is still getting a crash course in " Parenting 101 , " as she calls it - driving kids around , organizing schedules , taking the girls to get their hair braided ( an all-day affair ) . " What would I have been doing on this particular weekend if the teens were n't there ? " Pam wonders . " Chores , errands ? There 's this whole added dimension you get with a family . " What 's one thing that surprises her about being a mom ? " How quickly , " she says , " I 've fallen in love with the kids .
