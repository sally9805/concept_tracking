The strikers cheered as the tractor dragged the ancient Chrysler Newport in front of the main gate . Virgil Stemler , his long skinny arms straining with the effort , sloshed gasoline all over the car from a dented metal can . Mack Sanders followed closely behind him , jittery and playing to the crowd as he tossed a lit match onto the hood , then another , then another , jumping backward with each attempt , until whoosh , the rusty car burst reluctantly into flames . Sanders threw the matchbook to the ground and whipped around to accept our applause as the fire swelled behind him . There was something scary about his enthusiasm , and I wondered how many were like me , clapping only because I did n't want Sanders to pick me out of the crowd . Tom and I watched , along with half the population of Borden , Indiana , as a streak of greasy black smoke climbed straight into the sky , almost high enough to be seen beyond the heavily wooded walls of the valley that surrounded us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pedaled around the edges of the crowd on our dirt bikes . It was August 1979 , the second week of the strike , just before the start of ninth grade and high school . Like almost every other kid I knew , my dad worked at the plant , but I had somehow up to that point been unaware of the tectonic forces that had pulled and pushed us into our respective roles that summer . My ignorance met its end at about the same time that doomed Chrysler did . Before the summer was over , I would learn the differences between management and labor , scabs and thugs , and see the most amazing gunshot of my life . <p> My best friend 's full name was Thomas Jefferson Kruer . I 'm Andrew Jackson Gray . That 's not as strange a coincidence as it might seem outside the valley ; I had many friends named for the heroes of democracy . I also knew an Elvis , an Aron , and a Presley , a smattering of John Waynes , and two grown men who went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when Tom and I were n't friends , and we had been around each other so much that I often knew his thoughts , and he more often knew mine . That 's not to say Tom could n't surprise me . Frequently he would suggest an idea so crazy or so dangerous that I would stare in disbelief as he grinned and waited for me to come around to his way of thinking . <p> Tom and I wheeled around the outside of the crowd to get a better look , popping wheelies as we went . There were quite a few other kids from school there . I waved to Steve Koch , a classmate whose brother had died in Vietnam when we were all in kindergarten . I remembered him proudly showing us a set of dog tags in the cafeteria . Steve was laughing and wrestling Mark Deich , who was tossing Steve around like a rag doll . Mark had for some unknown reason a droopy , half-paralyzed face , but despite that affliction he was the undisputed strongest kid in our class , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I spotted Taffy Judd at the edge of the crowd , as always in her faded Pink Floyd T-shirt , the one with the rays of light coming out of the prism . I wanted to get a better look at her , but she was moving quickly along the perimeter of the crowd , almost as if she did n't want anyone to get too good a fix on her location . Taffy and I sat next to each other in second grade , and were for a time madly in love with each other . When we were given an assignment to write about what job we wanted when we grew up , I guaranteed myself weeks of unmerciful teasing by scrawling in crayon that I wanted to be a doctor , with Taffy as my nurse . Taffy agreed with that vision of the future , and drew a neat picture of herself in white holding hands with a smiling Dr. Gray . Our brief romance ended the next week when she caught me sharing my sandwich with Theresa Gettelfinger and hit me in the head with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends still occasionally gave me shit over Taffy . That was one of the reasons I tried to be subtle as I watched her . <p> As we got older , Taffy got harder and harder to spot in a crowd , lingering in the background as she did on the picket line , elusive and on the edges of the action . She lived in a trailer on a sliver of swampy land between Muddy Fork and Highway 60 . Her dad , Orpod Judd , worked at the plant when he was n't faking workmen 's comp injuries or doing time for some variety of drunken mayhem . Poverty was easy to hide in Borden , where even the very few of us who were certifiably middle class chose to live simply . Taffy had all the telltale signs , however , even beyond the limited wardrobe and the run-down trailer home : she did n't have to drop change into the pie plate for her school lunch every day , she seemed to fight the same cold all winter without a doctor visit , and in the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids of Borden . It was the number of the pay phone in front of Miller 's General Store , the common phone for those in the nearby trailers who could n't keep one of their own turned on . <p> " It 's already junk , " Tom said critically of the burning car , snapping me out of my thoughts about Taffy . It was true . Even as they reveled in their unfamiliar roles as labor fire-brands , my flinty German neighbors would no sooner destroy a functioning automobile than they would torch a church . Besides , along with strawberries and Christmas trees , junk cars in Borden were always a surplus crop . I followed him up to a rough-looking trio of older strikers in lawn chairs , all with Local 1096 ball caps and bulges of Skoal in their lips . They used the sticks of their picket signs to push themselves noisily backward as the fire grew too hot . <p> " Why are we burning a car ? " he asked them . His directness impressed me . I was afraid to admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like me , Tom was shirtless , tanned to a dark brown , and wearing shorts made from last year 's jeans . His young body was on the verge of carry ing knotty , showy muscle like his father , and he looked athletic and efficient , his body honed by exploring every corner of our valley with me every day , on bike and on foot . His hair was bushy and long , not because that happened to be the fashion of the moment , but because his mom could n't get him to sit still on the front porch for the twenty minutes she needed to give him a proper trim . His eyes were bright and alert , more so than mine , a giveaway to the reasonably perceptive that he was the smarter one of our pair . Other than that , on those rare occasions when we ran into strangers , they often thought we were brothers . So I guess we looked alike . <p> " Why are we burning a car ? " Tom asked again . The old men looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't think of a good reason themselves . <p> " That Sanders kid is nuts , " said one of the men in what was not quite an explanation . <p> " He ai n't been right since the accident , " said another . We all took a moment to be thankful for our intact testicles . <p> Tom persisted . " So why are we burning a car ? " " To keep the scabs out ! " said the third man , as if the official answer had suddenly dawned on him . He looked to his friends for affirmation and the bills of their caps dipped in agreement . I did n't know what a scab was , but it did n't seem to me that we were in any danger of being overrun by them . The parking lot of the Borden Casket Company was empty , except for the old Ford truck that belonged to Don Strange , the plant 's general manager . I presumed he could see the car 's flames from somewhere inside the empty factory , though we could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the strike . He shared with me each term he picked up  --  that morning he had explained " cost of living " to me . He knew by heart his father 's shifts on the picket line as well , six hours every day and a half . I could n't help but feel the sting of being left out when he talked about that . For reasons that had not yet been explained to me , my father was never on the picket line . <p> " Will the sheriff come ? " he asked . I was curious about the same thing . Sheriff Kohl was famously stern  --  he once ticketed New Albany High School 's basketball coach for cursing during a sectional championship game . I , too , was surprised that he would allow car burning in broad daylight along our busiest road . At the same time , the sheriff was a mysterious source of tension inside my home . I would not have brought the matter up on my own . <p> The striker threw a gap-toothed leer to his friends at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ai n't you Gus Gray 's kid ? " <p> " Yes , " I said . <p> " The sheriff wo n't come here . Do n't you worry about that . " <p> He was right . That old Newport burned right down to the wheels and Sheriff Kohl never came . <p> I was well into adulthood before I realized just how isolated we were up there in Borden , deep in the Hoosier Valley , at the edge of Clark and Washington counties . The rest of Indiana had been scraped clean by an advancing glacier during the last ice age , leaving the land geometrically flat and ready to divide into rectangular fields of beans and corn . Right at the Washington County line , the glacier stopped and retreated , so the primeval hills to the south were spared , all the way down to the Ohio River . Like parallel rows of barbed wire , the hills wrapped us up tight in protective layers of rolling , incon ve nient geography that kept road-pavers and subdivision-builders at bay . When I doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figment of my imagination , an idealization of a rural childhood when the size of my world was limited by how many miles I could ride my dirt bike , I remind myself of some of the creatures that Tom and I used to trap , shoot , and pull from the floating snares we made out of milk jugs and treble hooks . There were critters in Borden you just would n't see anywhere else . <p> Silver Creek wound back into the hills across giant banks of freshwater mussels . I do n't mean one or two lonely shells clinging to rocks ; I 'm talking about sheets of the things , thriving generations crusted on top of one another in porous layers that the water ran through with a distinctive , high-pitched sizzle . At Indiana University , in Bloomington , not all that far from Borden as the crow flies , I read once that freshwater mussels were endangered . I laughed out loud right there in the Main Library  --  Tom and I used to fill our backpacks with the empty shells and pretend they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Silver Creek widened and slowed , and on still summer days freshwater jellyfish paraded by , almost invisible to the untrained eye  --  they looked like pieces of Kleenex drifting just beneath the surface . Boys at school brought giant caterpillars stuffed into Mason jars for show-and-tell , behemoths as big around as Coke cans , with orange horns and elaborate fake eyes imprinted on their backs by the Creator . Between our steep hills sat small , deep , wedge-shaped ponds , home to croaking amphibians we called " mud puppies , " and slime-covered primitive fish with twitchy , stunted legs . My parents had spent good money , they periodically reminded me , on the set of red junior Encyclopedia Britannica s in my room . They stood in regal alphabetical order above my Springfield M6 rifle in its gun rack , my two most valuable possessions displayed on the same windowless wall . Those encyclopedias showed in exquisite color plates the grotesque Sargassum fish from the Red Sea , and Hawaii 's beautiful Moorish idol , but none of Borden 's local wildlife . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued below our feet . The valley was riven with limestone caves . Some were roped off , domesticated , and turned into tourist attractions for the Louisville families not worn out by their daylong harvest of what ever U-Pick crop was in season . Each had its own unique attraction . The tour of Marengo Cave finished in a chamber where visitors were encouraged to throw coins straight up , where they would stick in a muddy ceiling sheathed by years of captive pennies and nickels . Wyandotte Cave featured the footprints of prehistoric Indians leading to cold fire pits . Most spectacularly , Squire Boone Caverns contained the bones of Daniel Boone 's brother , Squire Boone , who had asked to be interred in the cave he had discovered . Every year of grade school we field-tripped there , where somber teachers warned us in vain to be respectful as we passed the dusty coffin . I 'd made the trip so many times I knew Squire 's epitaph by heart : My God my life hath much befriended , I 'll praise him till my days are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summer of the strike was that these were n't isolated , distinct caves , each with its own exit turnstile and gift shop . The whole thing was a system , a giant network of caves that ran wild throughout the region , connecting the tourist traps , the National Forest 's caves , and the pristine caves opening in the middle of the woods that only Tom and I knew about . There was really just one giant cave . Inside it lived a community of giant white crickets , albino crawdads , and even eyeless white fish , creatures mutated to complete blindness by eons of dark isolation . I could n't help but feel sorry for them . <p> Exploring the caves had become a passion of Tom 's that summer , and he seemed to find something almost magical in the way they could lead us from one end of the valley to the other . When the Chrysler began to smolder , and boredom returned to the picket line , he suggested we head underground . The thought of that cool , dry air was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursue . I turned to get a last look at Taffy as we left , but she was gone . <p> Excerpted from Over and Under by Todd Tucker . <p> Copyright 2008 by Todd Tucker . <p> Published in 2008 by St. Martin
