Kenneth Y. Tomlinson 's tenure as chairman of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting has been sponsored by the letter c , for controversy . In 2003 he became the head of the board , which oversees and funds public TV and radio . Since then , the Republican has fought what some conservatives consider PBS 's liberal bias and been accused of partisanship . PBS has had a string of culture-war flare-ups , including a spat over an episode of the kids ' program Postcards from Buster that featured two lesbian moms . Prominent Democrats last week called for Tomlinson 's resignation , while some House Republicans tried to slash the CPB 's funding by $100 million . <P> Tomlinson , 60 , a former Reader 's Digest editor with a soft Appalachian drawl , tells TIME he had hoped to bring quiet change . " I worked for a year and a half inside the system to rectify " the bias issue , he says . Yet his moves  --  hiring a G.O.P. activist to monitor the political balance of the news show Now with Bill Moyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conservative Journal Editorial Report onto air  --  rankled some within and outside public broadcasting . John Lawson , president of the Association of Public Television Stations , says the problem is not the CPB 's bringing in conservative voices , since " balance is in their mandate . " But , he says , " what we will fight to the end is when CPB or anyone else starts telling producers or journalists how to report stories . " <P> Democrats too have questioned the propriety of those actions : the Now researcher was paid more than $14,000 , and Tomlinson worked with a White House official to design the ombudsmen posts . But Tomlinson denies that he is advancing Republican interests . " Every time Bill Moyers goes on the air , " he says , " it helps the G.O.P. in the red states . " <P> Public TV fans cheered last week when the House rejected the proposed $100 million cut to the CPB 's budget . ( About $102.5 million for kids ' programming and technical upgrades is still cut from the House budget , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight is sure to continue , especially after Tomlinson last week helped secure the election of former G.O.P. co-chair Patricia de Stacy Harrison as CPB president . <P> The CPB is charged with shielding public broadcasting from political interference . And Tomlinson , who was first named to the CPB board by President Clinton , says that has been exactly his intention . " We needed balance for the sake of public broadcasting , " he says , " so that Republicans and conservatives would take it more seriously . " His critics counter that he just wants to pressure it to lean right . Says Jeff Chester , executive director of the liberal Center for Digital Democracy : " The idea that a schedule filled with the Newshour with Jim Lehrer , Antiques Roadshow , children 's programming and British mystery classics is a shrill liberal bastion is absurd .
