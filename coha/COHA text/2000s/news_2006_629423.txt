A Return to Collegiality Thank you for your strong endorsement of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops ( Current Comment , 12/8 ) . It should be noted that in recent years the Vatican , operating on a narrower understanding of episcopal collegiality , has limited the authority of such conferences . At the same time , after a quite public campaign against the pro-collegiality policies of the so-called Bernardin era , conservative leaders succeeded in drastically reducing the U.S.C.C.B. budget and staff . In the wake of the recent election , conservative leaders have signaled a renewed attack on the U.S.C.C.B. document Faithful Citizenship and the collegial approach it represents . Readers might consider doing something to support episcopal collegiality , shared responsibility , the U.S.C.C.B. and the consistent ethic of life by speaking up and by joining such groups as Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good . David O'Brien Professor Emeritus College of the Holy of her return to Catholicism , Called Out of Darkness ( Book Reviews , 12/1 ) , I grew worried to discover that Rice " concludes her spiritual memoir by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart of her fiction and at the center of cultural and religious debates , namely conflicts over gender and sexuality . " I feared the story of another returnee to Rome who immediately begins railing for the exclusion of others , forgetting his/her own long journey and misgivings on the way back to the church . How refreshing to read instead that Rice finds the heart of Catholicism in its aesthetic and sensual elements , rather than in clinging to the tangles of church law or an angry theology of exclusion . She is a writer of extraordinary sensitivity , one who could do much to help estranged Catholics in a way that a more defensive apologetics never will . Jacob Powers El Segundo , Calif . Method to Madness In your comments on the television show " Mad Men " ( Current Comment , 11/17 ) , you failed to recognize a secular spirituality expressed in the show that is rooted in the lives of laity raising families and making their living in the workplace . Beyond the " Catholic sensibility " referred to , there is much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our living God . I am sure there is much in " Mad Men " to criticize . But for me , one who raised a family of seven and worked in the " real world " of corporate management for 35 years , the show rings true . And if we believe in a caring and loving God , the scripts speak to how God touches lives in so many subtle ways - ways often not recognized by the church , but authentic just the same . Art Maurer Pensfield , NJ . Promises , Promises While I agreed with most of " Mr. Obama 's Promise " ( Editorial , 1 1/17 ) , I was extremely upset that you did not even mention Obama 's other promise : that the first thing he will do as president is to sign the Freedom of Choice Act . This act will bring back partial-birth abortion and could invalidate all the state laws for which pro-fife groups ( I am a member of several ) fought so hard . Leaving this promise out of your editorial was a serious omission . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clowns I found Franco Mormando 's review of the recent art exhibit of the works of Georges Rouault ( " Of Clowns and Christian Conscience , " 11/24 ) a forceful one , in which art was closely linked with prayer . Thank you for reintroducing me to an artist who has always been on the edge of my consciousness but now will be fully present . Charles Novo Houston , Tex . Sing for Your Supper Many thanks to James J. DiGiacomo , SJ. , for his beautiful thoughts on Advent in " We Should Have Seen It Coming " ( 12/1 ) . I agree that Advent is a time to be watchful for goodness , to embrace those who are different , to smile and bring compassion , understanding and mercy to those who are hurting . Also , it is a great time to teach children to be generous by encouraging them to write notes to soldiers or distant relatives , to pray around the Advent wreath , to prepare crafts for decorating and to " sing for their supper " with all those beautiful Christinas songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gregory D. Foster 's argument for selective conscientious objection for soldiers ( " One War at a Time , " 1 1/17 ) will become required reading for my high school theology students . As a teacher and pastoral minister , I find it impossible to encourage students to join the military , because there is no recourse to selective conscientious objection . The pope and the U.S. Catholic bishops argued that the invasion of Iraq would not be morally justifiable . What is a Catholic soldier to do ? She/he is put in the untenable position of having to be faithful to the guidance of the church or to the orders of his superiors . Foster 's article clearly reiterates what the bishops have already said , but does so from the perspective of a man with extensive military experience . Perhaps the bishops should join their voices with new urgency on this important issue . Tony Marinelli Westbury , N.Y . Preferential Option Kudos for your special issue on military chaplaincy ( 11/17 ) . Any priest who feels the call to minister among people living in poverty should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an awful lot of poor people serving in our armed forces . Jeffry Odell Korgen Montclair , N.J. Loud and Clear I agree with Drew Christiansen , SJ. , that the documents of the U.S.C.C.B. are not widely disseminated or read despite the important , often prophetic insights they can contain ( Of Many Things , 10/20 ) . But by facilitating a narrow discussion between themselves and a few experts rather than a broad , fully engaged Catholic debate about serious ethical issues in the political arena , the U.S. bishops have undercut their own role as teachers and pastors . More seriously , they have failed to hold the United States ( including all of us who are citizens ) to account for failing to follow the billion a year ; how can it be that the bishops are not furious over the $800 billion we now pour yearly into those same coffers ? Similarly , in 1973 and 1983 the bishops agreed to the " strictly conditioned " possession of nuclear weapons by the United States , but 3 5 years later those conditions have not been met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nuclear deterrence ? A third example is the current war in Iraq , which the bishops quite clearly said did not meet the criteria for a just war ; but why , once the war began , did they not make that assessment crystal clear to policy makers , Catholics and the general public ? Not all bishops are called to be prophets , perhaps ; but as teachers , pastors and religious leaders , they should have a voice that can be heard . Marie Dennis Washington , D.C. Synergy ? In Doris Donnelly 's interview of Mary Ann Glendon ( " Soft Power and Hope , " 1 1/24 ) , the U.S. ambassador to the Holy See sees the three visits of Pope Benedict XVI with President George W. Bush in little over one calendar year as " outward symbols of the close correspondence between the president and the Holy Father " and thinks that there has never been " more synergy of interest between the United States and the Holy See than there is now . " What does Glendon have in mind ? Is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor , a just minimum wage , medical coverage for all and respect for civil liberties and human rights ? Or is the synergy of interest about an unjust war , secret renditions , spying on one 's own citizens , subverting the U.S. Constitution , politicizing every department of government and abetting the pollution of the environment ? Since Glendon appears eager to minimize the significance of the Bush administration 's torture policies by comparing them to the presumed behavior of other countries , we are left to wonder about the answers to these and other questions .
