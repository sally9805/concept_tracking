" If someone poured a glass of ice water down your back , youd instantly assume good posture , " says physical therapist Ben Crawford . Think ofthat happening often enough , and you 'll make better body lines a habit . Photograph // If you spend most of your time hunched over a desk and slouching through other activities , here 's a good bet : Clothes do n't fit you well , you 're often a little breathless , you know you do n't make a super-strong first impression and you 've yet to find a sport you 're particularly good at . The simple powerful solution ? Stand up straight . Good posture changes how you breathe , how your clothes fit , the physical impact you make on others and how well you move in daily activities and sports , says Kevin D. Plancher , MD , associate clinical professor in orthopedics at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City . You appear taller and more confident too . Just think of how ballet dancers and professional runners walk . Easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute or two ; slumping seems to come naturally . " Changing habits is key , " says physical therapist Ben Crawford of the Texas Back Institute , a spine clinic at the Presbyterian Hospital of Piano . " So be creative . For instance , each time you take a sip of water , correct your posture . After a few weeks , it will be a habit . " The simple exercises ahead can help make sad-sack body lines a thing of the past too . You 'll also get the benefit of improved breathing-the result of lifting and opening your chest instead of letting it cave in . Better breathing means more oxygen flowing through your muscles , says Crawford . This lets your muscles work more efficiently , much like a car operates more smoothly when it is well-tuned . And good posture fights back pain , adds Aaron G. Filler , MD , PhD and author of Do You Really Need Back Surgery ? " When patients come in with neck and shoulder pain , often they do n't need a massage or an MRI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plancher . STRAIGHTEN UP ! " There 's an optimal position for the body , a true vertical alignment , with your body neither hunched forward nor leaning back , so that the spines natural structure supports you without a great deal of work from the back muscles , " says Filler . " But if you always hold your body in a way that strains the muscles-for example , stooping over so that the back muscles have to work to support you-you can end up in chronic pain . " Step one means strengthening three areas of the back and shoulders-specifically , says Plancher , the muscles in the upper shoulders and behind your neck ; the muscles between your shoulder blades , which help lift your chest up ; and the muscles that support your shoulders . It 's also important to work the " core , " says physiologist Beth Ribblett , fitness director of the Ochsner Clinic Foundation 's Elmwood Fitness Center in New Orleans . The core includes your stomach , lower back and pelvis . Most people concentrate on their abdomen and ignore the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which pulls your chest down and brings your shoulders and head forward , leaving you with rounded shoulders-a hallmark of poor posture-instead of having both chest and back opened up , Ribblett says . But you can fix all this in very simple , gentle ways , as you 'll see in these exercises . Crawford recommends doing these strengtheners and stretches twice per day at first . After several weeks , switch to once a day . Then after several more weeks , reduce to every other day . POSTURE BOOSTERS ? Can your shoes improve your posture ? Yes , say the folks at Masai Barefoot Technology who produce these MBTs . When walking in conventional footwear , the back of your heel strikes the ground first , then the ball of your foot . But the MBT has an extreme " rocker sole , " so the middle of your heel lands first , then you rock onto your forefoot . " MBTs effectively use the muscles of the heels , legs and buttocks , " says William Faddock , DPM , training director for the Foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lean forward as much to balance as you do in regular shoes , so you maintain a more erect posture . However , scientific data to support these claims is sparse . And Faddock says store training in the shoes is critical-it takes practice to get the hang of them , but then people often find them addictive . MBTs cost about $230 a pair and include a video .
