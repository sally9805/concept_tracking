Section : food &; nutrition appetites The best antidote that does n't involve wearing a muumuu <p> In my opinion , bad-hair days do n't hold a candle to feeling-fat days . You open your eyes in the morning and feel sick to your stomach . Then you remember last night 's dinner : fried onion rings , pizza with pepperoni and four kinds of cheese , and bread pudding with orange sauce for dessert . ( Was there anything green on your plate ? You ca n't recall . ) <p> You sit up and gaze at your middle . A groundswell of flesh is drifting toward the fluffy area that used to be your stomach . You haul your legs out of bed , and as you waddle to the bathroom , your thighs rub together . You catch a glimpse of yourself in the mirror . Bad mistake . Your eyes are swollen , your wrinkles have procreated during the night , and your skin is lackluster from a lifetime of not drinking eight glasses of water a day . Only 5 minutes have passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it 's time to go back to bed . <p> On bad-hair days you can wear a hat , but because body bags are not an option , on feeling-fat days you have to find an alternative way to put yourself together . After living through many of these days , I 've come up with a few tricks that I 'd like to pass on to you . They are : Wear red and wear a belt , preferably at the same time . Now , I know these might sound a bit trite , given the gravity of expanding flesh and thighs that seem to have taken on a life of their own , but trust me , they work . Red Does Wonders <p> Have you ever noticed that certain colors make you feel a certain way ? Green , for instance , can calm you down . Yellow can lift your spirits and bring a shot of joy into your heart . And red can work magic because it is the color of courage , strength , and power . And believe me , when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courage helps a lot . <p> Only yesterday I was feeling grumpy , pudgy , and tired . I took off the beige shirt I was wearing and slipped on a red blouse instead . Just looking at it made me feel more alive . It was n't an instant cure , but it did remind me that strength and power are qualities I already possess , qualities so near that I wear them literally on my sleeve . <p> My mother says red is a happy color . Red also evokes bravery and the ability to separate from what 's keeping you stuck , which is important to do on a feeling-fat day . The truth is , feeling fat has less to do with last night 's bread pudding than it does with your old beliefs about the connection between fat and self-worth , and between the size of your body and what you feel you are allowed to do or say or be . <p> Wearing red supports the idea that your past does not rule your life . It is a message to your psyche that says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my stomach is awash with ripples today , I am still allowed to be strong and powerful . I am still allowed to be loved and love myself . So pipe down . " <p> If you 've avoided everything red because you are convinced that wearing this color makes you look terminally ill , the word on the street is that with the proper shade of red , anyone 's skin will glow . Consider magenta , burgundy , fuchsia , or ruby . Or try shades that sound like romance novels : cherries in the snow , forever berry , or russet moon . But if you are steadfast in your anti-red stance , or if you need to wear sober uniforms to work , remember that you can adorn your toes , nails , and lips with red . As those who have spent years in retail therapy know , the operative word is accessorize , accessorize , accessorize . Belts and Reality Checks <p> I realize that on feeling-fat days , you want to hide . You wish you could call in sick to work or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venture outdoors , you will probably be wearing a muumuu-like article of clothing that you believe hides last night 's eating escapades . But in my experience , the best thing to wear on a day like this is a belt . A belt reminds you that you have a body and that it actually has a shape . <p> After working with tens of thousands of women in my workshops , I 've come to understand that most women have no idea what size their body truly is . Ask a friend to demonstrate how big her stomach is , and she will extend her arms 2 feet past her abdomen . Ask a group of women to describe the size of their thighs , and they will draw a verbal picture of hulking mounds with no resemblance to physical anatomy . We are hopelessly out of touch with reality when it comes to body size . <p> My friend Maria called me today . She told me that after getting some terrible news about her job , she went straight for the cookies , and after that , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She started talking about her stomach and how she was sure that none of her clothes would fit her today . I gave her my standard feeling-fat advice . Wear a belt , I said . She asked me if I 'd lost my mind . " My stomach is walking in front of me when I walk down the hall , " she said . " How can I wear a belt ? " I told her to get one of those cinch belts , the kind with elastic in them . <p> A few hours later , she called to say that she had on a red belt with a wooden buckle . " I have a waist ! " she shouted . " I guess it did n't disappear after all . " Reminding herself that she has a waist and that her feelings about her body size are different than her actual size allowed Maria to step out of her misery and come back to reality . ( And because she felt so much better about herself , she was less likely to turn to food again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple , concrete way of physically defining yourself . It allows you to circumscribe your body , to touch its boundary line . Despite what you ate last night , despite how fat you may be feeling at the moment , wearing a belt offers a reality check . It gives you a chance to distinguish between your ideas about how big you are and your actual body size . It serves to remind you that you and a small cottage are not the same size . And that is a good thing . If all else fails ... <p> When you have a fat-and-ugly attack , wear the most luscious thing you have , even if you 're just washing dishes . Pick something that makes you feel graceful . Break the barrage of self-insults by treating yourself as if you deserve your own loving attention now . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Waist definer-a belt <p> By Geneen Roth <p> <p> Geneen Roth is the author of six books on emotional eating and a memoir , The Craggy Hole in My Heart and the Cat Who Fixed It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
