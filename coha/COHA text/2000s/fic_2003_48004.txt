I 'VE JUST STAGGERED through the nine o'clock show and I 'm back in my dressing room when Morrie comes in . The postman always rings twice , but Morrie does n't even bother to knock . Morrie 's my agent , a.k.a . That Bloodsucking Leech . I like that in a guy . Badum-DUM . <p> " Kris , baby , what in hell was that out there ? " Morrie says , homing in on the nearest piece of furniture and sitting down without looking where he 's planting that fat ass of his . " You died , man ! You fucking died ! " <p> " Tell me something I do n't know . " <p> " Oh , now you 're funny ? " Morrie runs one hand through his thinning hair , accidentally yanking a few strands out of that pathetic little ponytail he wears . Why does n't he just have someone tattoo GEEK on his forehead ? " I got news for you , man : You 're a little too late . " <p> " This is news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's me . " I give him the Punchline Smile , the one that 's usually the turning point of my routine , the moment when no matter how cold the audience reaction has been up till then , they all wake up and laugh . <p> It works about as well on Morrie as it did on the zombie-wannabes out there tonight . <p> Morrie shakes his head . " Kris , " he says . " Kris , Kris , Kris , what is your problem ? Fear of success ? Come on , you can tell me ; it 's nothing to be ashamed of , it 's a very common psychological condition . " <p> A common psychological condition . Right . Meaning that the little chippie Morrie is presently shtupping read an article about it in Cosmopolitan . <p> " Look , Morrie , " I say . " I do n't have a problem , okay ? Everyone has a bad night now and then . It 's par for the course . Quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus . " It 's a cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trotting out the old Classical education , but it 's the one thing I have always been able to count on when I want Morrie to shuttus the hell uppus . <p> Tonight it does n't work . Figures . <p> " Huh ? What 's that supposed to mean ? " Morrie demands . Usually , when I bop him over the head with a Latin tagline , he just nods and tries to look smart , like he knows exactly what I 'm talking about . Then he changes the subject faster than a crooked CEO at a stockholders ' meeting . " Stop being such a fucking snob , Kris ; you know I do n't speak French . " <p> I also know when I 'm beat . " What it means , Morrie , is ' Even good old Homer nods off from time to time . ' " <p> " Well , sure he does . All those pork chops Marge feeds him , no wonder . But what 's The Simpsons got to do with you ? " <p> Oy , Morrie . Kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I sigh and say : " Not a thing . I 'm just saying that tonight I came onstage with the deck stacked against me . Did you get a load of the act I had to follow ? Some bimbo who stole Roseanne 's old Domestic Goddess bit , only she spruced it up with a couple of SUV gags and some crap about the Zone Diet . The skank could n't find ' original ' in the dictionary , but that 's okay by the bozos out front because she 's a gorgeous blond with big tits who also could n't find a working bra in Victoria 's Secret . Every time she slams a punchline she jumps up and down , so she looks like she 's packing two sacks of mozzarella cheese in an earthquake ! " <p> " Mmmmmm , " says Morrie . " Cheese . " And this dreamy smile transforms him so he no longer looks like a toad . Now he 's a horny toad . " Nice kid , I gave her one of my cards . Shows a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was showing ? Once you get her to sign on , you can book her as the only broad in the business with three big boobs on her chest . " I expect Morrie to get mad and storm out of my dressing room . In fact , I 'm banking on it . <p> Banking 's not what it used to be . I 'm old enough to remember when they used to give you a free toaster or a broiler oven or even an electric blanket for opening up an account , instead of just crappy interest rates and sappy kittens-and-daisies check patterns . Shoot , I 'm even old enough to remember when you got a personal note of thanks from one of the Medici boys at First Firenze National , though the penalty for early withdrawal in those days was usually a heaping helping of arsenic-and-calamari casserole . <p> Ba-dum-d - Oh , the hell with it . <p> " Dude , forget the blonde , " Morrie says . Like he could . " You 've had bad spots in the lineup before this and still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Frisco ? Atlanta ? Chicago ? You killed , Kris ! You totally killed ' em . So how come you had to lay a shit egg tonight of all nights ? Tonight when we got the Hollywood suits out there waiting to see your chops ? " <p> " Hey , they do n't wear suits and I do n't like chops , " I say , trying to derail the Little Agent That Could ( But Should n't ) . " And I really do n't like st - " <p> The bastard does n't let me finish . He 's blinded by the sight of lots and lots of dollar bills growing little cartoon wings and flapping their way back to La-La Land . <p> " You know how long I have waited for a chance like this ? " he shouts at me . " All those years of booking one no-hoper after another , every class clown who ever got the other morons to laugh when he made cole slaw shoot out his nose ; every punk who decided he was Noel Coward because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the dinner table ; every wimpy zhlub who thought he was the next Woody Alien because he was short , whiny , and ugly ; every corn-fed time-waster who was convinced that if he just kept talking and talking and talking about the fine folks out in Bunghole , West Dakota , that made him the new Garrison Keillor , God spare us all , and now - " ( Poor son-of-a-bitch is about to pass out if he does n't catch his breath , but he is by hell going to finish this monster sentence. ) " - now when I 've got my hands on someone with real talent and a fresh act , now you go and choke on me just when success is within my - I mean , our grasp ? You ca n't do this to me , Kris ! I 'll see you dead first ! " <p> Morrie is upset , or he would n't leave me alone with a straight-line like that . I show a little class and leave it lie . Sometimes you just got ta let the fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's cruel to take advantage of a man who 's not thinking before he speaks , if he 's thinking at all . <p> " Do n't blame me for your pipe dreams , " I tell him . " The whole Hollywood deal was a no-go from the start and we both know why . Want me to explain it to you one more time , so maybe it 'll finally penetrate ? Nothing fancy , just a quick round of ' What 's Wrong With This Picture . ' " <p> I grab his lapels and yank him to his feet before he can say a word , dragging him to stand beside me at the dressing room mirror . I 've been wanting to do this since the moment that big clod sat himself down on my coffin without a by-your-leave . What does he think , it 's a prop ? Do I look like Carrot Top ? As I hoist the mook , his heels smack against the side of the casket , putting an ugly scratch in the finish . Damn . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touchup later . I 've got more important things to do , like getting my agent to return an e-mail from Reality . <p> " There ! " I say , holding Morrie by the scruff of the neck and shoving him forward so there is no way he can claim that the greasy smears on the glass are my reflection . The only image the shiny surface reproduces is his own . " Look close , try to see Kris Spiridion . Try . Whaddaya see ? I 'll tell you what ! You see bubkes , is what . And when anyone tries to take a picture of me , or shoot me on film or videotape , whaddaya get ? Likewise bubkes . I 'm as visible as a Republican at a Gay Single Mothers for Gun Control fundraiser ! " <p> " Yyyyeah . " Morrie admits to the truth , but slowly , and only when he gets it shoved in his face . Of course right away , he tries to put his own spin on it . " If you tried what I suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I betcha that little problem of yours would - " <p> I jerk Morrie away from the mirror . " Sweetie , cookie , baby , jackass , this is the first time since the reign of Alexander the Great that I 've heard anyone refer to my habit of draining the blood of the living as my ' little problem . ' More fiber , you want I should get ? I do n't think Metamucil dissolves real good in A-Positive . The technical reason for why I do n't cast a reflection or show up on film is because I have no soul . None . Not even a little one . Say it with me : I am the anti-James Brown ! Why do you have such a hard time accepting that ? I 'm a vampire : V like in vein , A like in aorta , M like in my God , that guy who plays Spike on Buffy is hot , P like in pulse , I-R like in I.R.S. , E like in the letter that comes after D-is-for-Dracula . Get it ? Got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulseless , soulless member of the undead ! " <p> I have seen barnacles with less stick-to-it-iveness than my agent . " Kris , " he says patiently . " Gahdfahbid I should ever do or say anything to disenfranchise you from your undeadhood . I fully respect your proud heritage as a Post-Interment-American . Okay , a naturalized American , but who am I to judge ? Do I sound like I come from one of the First Families of Virginia ? So you 're heartless , pulseless , soulless , fine . You wan na be jobless , too ? Keep screwing up for the Hollywood suits , you 'll get there , believe you me . " <p> " Hollywood , " I mutter . " Speaking of heartless , pulseless and soulless . So whaddaya want out of my afterlife , hanh ? That I should wow these Tinseltown Schmucks so they give us a big , fat sitcom contract ? " <p> " Yes , " he says , like it 's gon na be a cakewalk . Not that Morrie ever walked past a nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? " I ask . " So say they like my stuff , they make with the contract , I sign on , and we all go out to California - sunny freakin ' California , no less ! - to shoot this puppy , is that how you see it ? " <p> Again Morrie makes with the cool , serene , **29;1155;TOOLONG " Yes . " <p> " So as long as you 're seeing things , Morrie , you mind telling me how in hell you see them filming me ? " <p> " Oh , " he says . I think he 's got it . By George ( and Elaine , Jerry , and Kramer ) , I think he 's got it . Finally . Poor bastard looks like all Santa left him in his stocking was a freshly severed foot . <p> Yum . <p> " Is-is that why you screwed the pooch at the nine o'clock ? " he asks . " On purpose , so they would n't find out what you really are ? " <p> " Yeah , Morrie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel sorry for him . I ca n't tell him the real reason I flopped at the nine o'clock - he 'd go Dark Ages on my ass if he knew - so I lie like an incumbent rug . " I did it with prior intent and malice aforethought and like that there , so the suits would n't give me a second look . Why set myself up for heartbreak ? If they liked what they saw and signed me , the truth would come out the minute they rolled tape . Not only would I be fired , I 'd be history . I was history , one time back during the French Revolution , and believe me , it 's not pretty . " <p> " You could always go back to doing live standup , " Morrie says . He 's an optimist . Any man who used to manage Marcia the Amazing Juggling Cow has to be . <p> " ' Live ' ? " I echo . " Morrie , right now the only live thing about me is my career . How long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm undead ? " <p> " Who 's gon na let word get out ? " <p> " In Hollywood ? Please tell me you did n't ask that . Everyone out there 's got ta take the E.S.L. test ' cause their native tongue is fluent Gossip . At best - which never happens - I 'll lose my audience on the club circuit because I 'll have the stench of flop sweat clinging to me like bimbo on a billionaire . At worst I 'll spend the rest of my afterlife being dogged by gothgeeks . " <p> " Hey , let 's not paint things blacker than we got ta . " Morrie smiles . Easy for him ; it 's not his future we 're gambling . " I tell you what , kid : I 'm going out there to talk to the suits and convince them to stay for your eleven o'clock show . You go out there at eleven and do n't hold back . Give it everything you got , straight up . Pull no punchlines , take no prisoners . Either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate you , no harm done , back to business as usual , your secret 's safe . If they love you - Well , I 've been thinking , and you know what ? If they love you - I mean really , really Hollywood love you - they 'll find a way to work around your little , um , substance abuse issue . I mean , if they decide you look like a bigtime money maker , they 're not gon na let a little thing like vampirism get in the way ; not when there 's serious cash at stake . " <p> " You wan na rephrase that ? " I suggest , shuddering . " Without the S-word ? " <p> Morrie 's oblivious . He 's fast in the thrall of Hypocrisalia , the Muse of Bullshit . " So whaddaya say , huh ? You 'll at least try at the eleven o'clock ? For me ? " <p> I know when I 'm beat . " Sure , Morrie , right , yeah , whatever you want . " <p> " Super @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides of my face , then finishes the job with a finger-pistol shot right for my heart . " You 're beautiful , baby ! Do n't ever change . " <p> Like I could . <p> Well , at least he 's gone . I 'm finally alone in my dressing room , alone with my thoughts . Most of them are about Morrie and the Hollywood suits , with some interesting co-star work involving manacles , red hot fireplace pokers , big jalapeno peppers , and ferrets with bad attitudes , but business before pleasure . I 've got to think about whether or not I 'll actually follow through on what I promised Morrie . Do I really give the suits the best I 've got or do I take another dive ? <p> The trouble is , I know what I want to do : I want to go out there and slay them . I want them to see me , hear me , love me . I want the applause . I want to make them want me . I ca n't help it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression , and it 's been there since back in the days when I actually had blood that was n't lend-lease , back before I called myself Kris Spiridion , back when I first read for the part of Herakles in The Frogs and made Aristophanes himself laugh so hard he did a spit-take with a mouthful of retsina . <p> I want to make them laugh . <p> I want to . I ca n't . I mean , I can , but I do n't dare . <p> Life was complicated enough , but when did death get to be such a hassle ? I 'm still staring into the empty mirror when Eric comes in . <p> " Kris , darling ! " he cries , grabbing me from the back and giving me a big hug and a kiss that explodes loudly in my right ear . " I saw you out there tonight . You stank ! I ca n't tell you what that means to me . " He spins me around and gives me a second kiss on the mouth that plumbs the depths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Good thing I no longer need to worry about silly little mortal things like , oh , breathing . <p> " Um , sure , Eric , sure , " I say , as soon as I can , when the only tongue in my mouth in my own . " You know , about tonight - " <p> Eric does n't let me finish . " All those times you said you loved me , I did n't really believe you . I mean , duh ! You 've been alive for , like forever . How many times have you said you loved anyone and meant it ? How could you , knowing they 're going to die on you and stuff . But this - ! Man , this , like , so totally proves you really do love me . Wow ! Coolness . " <p> He tosses his head back so even the cheap dressing room lights play up his sparkling green eyes , thick black hair , perfect white teeth , skintight leather - Say , is it hot in here ? That gorgeous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's standing still , damn it . No surprise : He was working as a part-time model , full-time rentboy when I found him . Being a vampire 's mortal slave does n't pay as well as pouting for the cameras , but it 's steadier work and I throw in free dental . <p> The trouble is , these days it 's kind of up for debate as to which one of us is the slave . Ladies , gents , a word of advice that will serve you well : Never play with your food . <p> The reason I deliberately screwed up out there at the nine o'clock had nothing to do with the suits or the phantom sitcom contract or the fact that I do n't show up on film . The real reason , like you have n't already guessed it , was Eric . He asked me to throw the show . <p> Asked ? More like told . <p> I can still see his eyes brimming with tears as he said , " Darling , I know this sounds totally selfish , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you do go out there and do good they 'll take you away to Hollywood and it 'll be all over between us and I 'll never see you or speak to you again ! " <p> To which I replied : " But Eric , if I go , you come too . " <p> " Well , whoop-de-shit , " he said , all of his tears suddenly gone , evaporated in the blast furnace of a blistering pout . " As what ? Your accessory ? Your boytoy ? Your portable honor bar ? While all of those sweet young West Coast love monkeys are snuggling up to you at the industry cocktail parties , what do I do for small talk ? " <p> Eric 's got one hell of a gift for mimicry , even when he 's only imitating himself . Before I could blink he 'd turned it on full force , making like he had a Black Russian in his right hand and a Blond Airhead at his left elbow . " ' Hi , I 'm Eric . I 'm Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's crudite wrangler ? Only imported French sea salt for her celery stalks ? Wow . Oh , you want to know what I do ? My job ? The reason for my existence ? What goes on my resume ? I get drunk . In every sense of the word . ' " <p> I made a big mistake : I tried reasoning with him . " Baby , you know I do n't drink your blood anymore . I already did it twice - once when we met and once when we were at that party after the Halloween parade down in the Village - " <p> I stopped . Even though he was royally pissed at me , Eric and I still exchanged our special smile . I know it sounds goopy , but we always had to do the old blush-wink-grin bit whenever the subject of that post-parade party came up . It was the first event we attended as a couple . We both thought it 'd be fun ( to say nothing of cheap ) if we switched roles for the holiday , so he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to play his boytoy , chewtoy , whatever . We were a real hit with the crowd , to say nothing of being a mutual turn-on and - and <p> Well , and I kind of got carried away and bit him . Look , for a vampire , that 's always gon na be the number one biggie in the Complete Guide to Carnal Thrills . Everything else we do - and I do mean everything - is like drinking your sister through a screen door . <p> " So anyway - " I went on . " Anyway , I ca n't bite you again or you 'll turn into a vampire . Third time 's the charm . " <p> " When did I say I did n't want to become a vampire ? " Eric demanded . " It 'd be cool ! " <p> " Trust me , it 's more like tepid , " I told him . <p> " Why ? Because you do n't want me to do it ? Because you 're afraid of being stuck with me for all eternity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my eyes . " Because if I never died , you could n't go shopping for a new coffin-bunny ? " <p> I rolled my eyes . " Eric , I put up a good front , but unnatural existence for untold centuries is not the midnight picnic you think . It 's like - like living with a raspberry seed permanently stuck between the two front teeth of your soul ! " ( Hey , I 'm a stand-up comedian , not an analogist ... metaphorologist ... similian ... guy who does that kind of A-is-like-B language thing . ) <p> " Yeah , only vampires do n't have souls ! " Eric countered . " So where 's that raspberry seed stuck now , huh ? If eternal existence is such a pain in the ass , how come I do n't see you throwing yourself on a shish kebab skewer , or running chest-first into a low-hanging pointy branch , or going out to Sunnydale and looking up Buffy 's phone number ? " <p> ( You know , I 've tried to convince Eric that Buffy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes back at me with : " Ha ! That 's what they wanted us to believe about about Mulder and Scully too ! " so I gave up . ) <p> " Eric , what can I say ? " I held up my hands , helpless . " Existence is tenacious . No matter how much I might long for the peace of eternal sleep , there 's always something inside me that holds me back from taking the final step into the abyss . " <p> " Abyss , schmabyss , " Eric replied . " You 've got a million excuses for everything . And what do I have ? Nothing . Nothing except how much I love you . " He started crying again . The kid had flip-top tear ducts ! <p> I do n't know what made me give him what he wanted . Maybe it was the tears , maybe it was his simple , passionate declaration of devotion , maybe it was just my own deep , fervent desire never to have to hear a word like schmabyss uttered again , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I promised Eric I 'd throw the show . <p> But I never promised I 'd throw every show . <p> So that 's how I wind up here in the dressing room , about to tell Eric I 've changed my mind yet again , that I 'm not going to screw up the eleven o'clock show the way I botched the nine . This is going to get ugly . <p> I take a deep breath . Dead man walking . <p> IT 'S HALF PAST eleven and I 'm sitting in the open-all-night diner a couple blocks from the comedy club , sucking the insides out of an order of cheese blintzes , when Patsy notices I 'm there . Patsy 's my favorite waitress and she tells me I 'm her favorite customer , but I bet she says that to all the undead . Patsy 's a genuine Goth as opposed to a gothgeek , though she 's much too much of a Goth to actually call herself a Goth because if she did , that would make her a gothgeek instead , if you follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . She explained the whole megilla to me once and I still do n't get it . <p> Anyway , Patsy can call herself a cantaloupe for all I care . She 's a nice kid and that 's what counts in the long run . Believe me , I know from the long run . <p> " Hey ; Kris , " she says , coming over to give me a refill on coffee even though I 'm not seated at her station . Tonight she 's going for the Classic look : Matte black hair , clothes , shoes , fishnet stockings , everything black , black , black , except the regulation white diner apron and the pink and blue Hello Kitty tattoo high on her right cheekbone . The guy who manages this joint does n't care how she dresses as long as the Health Department does n't have an PDA-approved cow . On the graveyard shift , most customers would rather get their coffee poured by Morticia Addams than Britney Spears anyhow . <p> " What are you doing here ? " she asks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Mnyeh , " I reply . I do n't wan na talk about it . <p> She frowns . Then she happens to notice the flattened blintzes on my plate and she scowls hard enough to turn her tattoo into Hello Kitty Litter . ( I chose my seat deliberately when I came in here , avoiding Patsy 's station on purpose , knowing that once I gave her my order , she 'd refuse to turn it in . Too bad I did n't eat faster and get my waitress to clear the plate before Patsy saw it . ) As Eric would say , I am , like , so totally busted . <p> " What the hell do you think you 're doing , eating that ? " she demands . " You trying to kill yourself ? For real , this time ? " <p> " Patsy , you know all that crap about vampires only surviving on the blood of the living is , okay , crap . " ( I told you I was n't a similian ! ) " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got spread around in the sixteenth century . Coincidentally , it sprang up right after the Spanish brought chocolate to Europe . You wan na know what I think ? I think the old vampires started the whole ' Ve nefer dreenk .. . wine ' con job to keep the dead-come-lately newbies from muscling in on the hot cocoa supply . " <p> Patsy makes a face . " I 'm not talking about you eating food , fool ; I 'm talking about you eating that food ! Cheese blintzes ? You told me you 're lactose intolerant . You know you 're going to regret it tomorrow . It 's damned hard to light a match inside a coffin . Or do you want to die in the gas chamber ? " <p> I push the plate away , if only to acknowledge that she 's right . It 's an empty gesture otherwise , done too late to do me any good , so I also make a mental note to stick a heavy duty air freshener inside my coffin lid before sunrise . " I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Yeah , or else you 're thinking too much , " she counters . Putting down the coffee pot , she leans across the counter and murmurs , " It 's Eric , is n't it ? " <p> I do n't know what it is about that simple little question that makes me spill my guts . Maybe it 's the way she asks it , like she already knows the answer . Maybe it 's how her voice gives away how much she pities me , so much in love with Eric that I 'm willing to drop all my dreams just on his say-so . Maybe it 's the second question , the one she does n't ask because she does n't need to , because I can hear it clear as a bell without her having to put it into words : <p> Kris ... is he really worth it ? <p> Hell of a question . Damned if I know the answer . Damned if I do n't , too . <p> I tell her the whole story , Eric and Morrie and Hollywood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm done , she says , " Okay , so he said that if you really loved him , you 'd blow off the eleven o'clock show entirely , right ? Not even show your face , just skip out ? " <p> I nod . <p> " No matter what that 'll do to your career ? To your reputation ? To your standing as a professional ? " <p> I nod again . <p> " That 's what he said you 'd do if you really loved him , " she says . " So tell me , Kris : What would he do if he really loved you ? " <p> And there it is . Simple as basic black . Amazing I did n't think of it myself , after having lived this long . Well , that 's what I get for sleeping through Intro Philosophy class , though I 'm telling you , old man Plato could send furniture into hibernation when he got to yammering on about the Perfect State . <p> Suddenly , everything falls right into place . I 'm no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by desire . I know just what I 've got to do . <p> I check the clock and leap to my feet . " All right , I can still make my slot ! Great ! A couple minutes late , but - " I start fumbling for my wallet to pay the tab , only Patsy leans all the way over and gives me a shove . <p> " Come back and pay up after , " she says . " Now move your undead ass ! " <p> I race back to the club , getting my game face on , working myself up so I 'll give the best performance of my afterlife . I 'm halfway there when I check my watch and discover that the diner clock 's ten minutes slow . Shit ! That means I 'm going to be more than just a couple of minutes late . I start praying that Morrie 's had a word with the M.C. , got him to hold off taking me out of the batting order , as it were , or even persuaded him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start running through some Sorry I 'm late , folks , but a funny thing happened to me on the way to the theater ... material as I sprint through the streets . <p> I barge into the club the front way instead of by the stage door , to save time . I 'm in such a goddam hurry I crash into a busboy . Everyone laughs . Okay , fine , I can use this , work with it , nothing wrong with a little slapstick , some good old-fashioned <p> Then I realize that they 're not laughing at me . <p> Someone else is up on the stage , under the lights , taking my time slot . He 's wearing a long black cape , an all-black outfit , and he 's looking into the audience , giving them the Punchline Smile . <p> My Punchline Smile : The one I use after I 've started the act with a few jokes so unbelievably lame that it 's a sure thing some wiseguy out front will holler , " You suck ! " <p> Which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows off my fangs so clearly that you ca n't miss them even if you 're that guy in the Coke-bottle bifocals all the way back in the cheap seats . I flash the fangs and I say something like " You got that right , " or " Well , duh ! " or " You must work for the government , Einstein ! " and that 's it , that 's the moment when I segue into the You Think You Got Problems ? Try Being Undead in This City/Economy/Dating Scene/Administration ! routine . That 's when they all fall right into my hands . <p> Only tonight they 've fallen into the wrong hands . Someone else is up there , wrapped in one of my spare capes , using my material , showing off a pair of plastic neck-jabbers that are an embarrassment to the whole Haemophagic-American community and getting my laughs doing it . <p> " Eric , you son-of-a-bitch ! " I scream from the back of the house . " So that 's why you did n't want me to go on ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross between Bambi and Count Chocula . I go bounding up the aisle , right past the table where Morrie and the Hollywood suits are still laughing over the act Eric swiped wholesale from me . <p> What follows next is a blur . I hear myself calling Eric every name in the really filthy book . He 's giving back as good as he gets , though the fake fangs kind of get in the way of bad language and good diction . The first two rows of tables are drenched in spit , but they do n't care : They 're laughing too hard at what sounds to them like just another lovers ' quarrel gone ballistic . It 's always funny when it 's someone else 's dirty laundry flapping in the breeze . <p> Finally Eric yanks out his fangs and stamps on them . " You moron ! " he shouts at me . " Do you even realize why I did this ? It 's for you , dammit ! You 've got a solid gold act and a cardboard cutout delivery ! You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not as much as they would if they ever heard your act performed like it deserves . You are , like , so dead that if someone jabbed a wooden stake through your heart no one could tell the difference . You make Dick Cheney on tranqs look like Robin Williams on double-shot espressos ! " <p> " And you make a horse 's ass look good by comparison ! " I yell back . " The funniest thing you ever said in your life was ' I am an ac-torrrrr ! ' " <p> " Oh , like you are ? " Eric sneers . <p> " Every time I fake one with you , baby . Every single time . " <p> Eric kicks over the high stool they leave onstage in case one of us wants somewhere to leave a cup of water or a prop for the act or something . He kicks it so hard that one of the legs splinters off . <p> " Man , you are such a glory-hog ! " he rants , stamping his foot . " Would it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait : There 's only one thing that will kill you . " <p> And the little turd makes a grab for the busted-off piece of wood from the prop stool . The audience goes wild . It 's like they 're all caught up inside an Anne Rice novel ghost-written by Judy Tenuta . <p> I go wild , too . Eric 's blatant treachery turns me inside out , burns me worse that a thousand sunrises . All of a sudden I realize how much his professions of love really meant . There 's only room for one person in his heart , which means he wo n't hesitate an instant before ramming a stake through mine . <p> The hell he will . <p> I grab hold of his cape and jerk back hard . Eric chokes and pratfalls right on his tight little butt . His leather pants make a whoopee-cushion sound on the stage floor . The crowd applauds . I pick up him by the throat with one hand , grab the stake with the other , and I give the paying customers the Smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tell them , holding the stake on high . " I 've been doing standup so long , the only thing that can kill me 's a schtick through the heart . " Ba-dum-flumpf . They groan . I do n't blame them ; that one needs a rewrite . <p> A rewrite ... <p> Slowly the full picture dawns on me ( and trust me , that is not an image we vampires find appealing ) . All those things Eric said , the stuff about how I 've got a great act but I should n't be the one doing the delivery , now I know exactly how he saw our future : The suits would fall in love with him tonight , not me . They 'd give him my sitcom and Morrie would n't do a thing , except maybe get Eric 's signature on an exclusive contract so fast it 'd leave scorch marks on the paper . Everyone would be a lot happier : Eric 's prettier than me , he 'll attract a bigger , younger viewer demographic , and it 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film . <p> And after the pixie dust settles , where does that leave me ? <p> As the writer . Eric 's writer . Eric 's Hollywood writer , dung-beetle to his butterfly . <p> That bastard . <p> My eyes go red . Before , I was only going to smack the little shit upside the head with the stake he meant for me , but now - now it 's out of my hands . I 'm no longer responsible for my own actions . I have not been so consumed by primal , berserk , ravening bloodlust since the Dodgers hauled their sorry turncoat asses out of Brooklyn . A captive of my own rage , I feel all rational thought slip from my grasp like quicksilver as my thirst for vengeance swiftly transforms itself into a more basic thirst . I can not think beyond the moment , and the moment screams REVENGE ! Did this miserable mortal creature in my grasp actually have the brazen , boldfaced temerity to deceive me , defy me , deride me , to try to turn me into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will make him pay . <p> Just before I plunge my fangs into Eric 's throat , I look out at the audience and cheerfully say , " Remember , folks , do n't drink and drive . Flying 's another story . " <p> I 'm still draining him dry as a week-old bagel when the suits storm the stage and get me to sign the sitcom deal while the rest of the audience continues giving me a standing O. <p> So I see by the trades that the network 's anted up for an additional thirteen episodes of Byte Me ! ( The wacky adventures of a couple of computer nerds who just happen to be vampires . ) This , after the whole first season went by without my face ever showing up once on the TV screens of our devoted fans . You 'd think that 'd be a problem , but no . Morrie was right : Love will find a way , and so will Hollywood , when there 's enough money involved . <p> C.G.I . technology ... who knew ? It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( I mean , he 's cute , but not my type in any sense of the word . ) It 's been a long time since I 've been able to check out my reflection in a mirror , but Morrie assures me that my image looks just like me , plus it gives the show its special " hook , " having the two nerd vampires show up as computer-generated characters . <p> Well , that and the fact that we made the mistake of storing our coffins in the basement of an all-girls high school in Malibu . <p> And that all the girls are Phys . Ed . Majors with a required course in Advanced Trampoline . <p> And that some of them are exchange students from Sweden . <p> And that Eric 's character 's a virgin . <p> Ah , yes : Eric . He 's happy now . He finally got his big break in showbiz and all it took to seal the deal was giving up his immortal soul and making a full-time commitment to draining the blood of the living . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As for me , I 'm happy too , though I got ta tell you , some of these scripts they give me , I would n't use ' em to line a hamster cage . The suits said they liked my original act , but once they got me out here , they changed everything . They 're downplaying the whole vampire angle and playing up Eric 's virginity like he never did , and as for any mention of us being gay ? Fahgeddaboudit . Not until Will and Grace goes off the air or Ellen comes back from the dead . Plus they 're dicking around with my image so I 'm gradually morphing into the lovechild of Brad Pitt and Russell Crowe . I do n't know how they 're gon na deal with it when I have to show up in the flesh for the Emmys , but I 'm sure they 'll think of something . <p> Hell , I 'm terrified they 'll think of something . <p> Maybe I ought a just throw over the whole sitcom package , ditch the world of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to doing standup , back to being my own corpse . Shoot , I 'm already booked to host Saturday Night Live , if the Irony Police do n't stop me . Once I 'm back on the Right Coast , why could n't I just stay there ? <p> I could do it , I could get back in the game . All that stuff I told Morrie about how it 'd be impossible to go back to doing standup , that was just smoke and mirrors to cover up the whole mishegaas with Eric . Why should I care if I do pull in the gothgeeks and the Byte Me ! groupies and the trendoids who 'll go see anyone whose name they recognize from People magazine ? An audience is an audience , as the Christian said to the lions . All I need is some new material . Hey , how 's this sound for openers ? <p> Good evening , folks , I just flew back from L.A. and boy , are my wings tired . A funny thing happened to me on the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proof breath staggers up to me and says he has n't had a bite in days , and so - No , I did n't bite him . I nefer dreenk ... winos . ( Ba-dum-DUM ! ) Hey , anyone from Jersey in the audience ? Sorry to hear it . <p> Just kidding , I love Jersey . It 's good to know there 's somewhere worse to spend your daylight hours than a coffin . In fact , I love you all so much , I could just eat you up . So lie back , push away that garlic pizza , pull down those turtleneck sweaters , relax and enjoy the show . <p> Oh , and do n't forget to nip your waitress . <p> Author Affiliation
