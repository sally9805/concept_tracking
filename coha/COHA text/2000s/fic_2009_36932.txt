I <br> <p> May 5 , 2007 ; 2:00 p.m . <p> So this is how it starts : <p> I 'm watching Chase Latham lift up the edge of my cousin 's skirt beyond what can be considered polite or appropriate , and I 'm just starting to regret introducing them to each other two years ago at that bar in Philadelphia when I see the horse stumble , before buckling at the knees and then collapsing  --  dead  --  in an equine pile of hoofs and hair and teeth . Unfortunately for the horse , at that particular moment every man in the Latham , Scripps , Howard , LLP tent is quietly wishing he was one of Chase Latham 's sly , tan fingers , and every woman is fantasizing about being a patched square on Annalee 's madras skirt , so time ticks by for a languid three minutes before anyone notices that the unlucky beast has died . <p> A man 's voice crackles and breaks over a loudspeaker and when the feedback finally clears he announces that a horse named Prep School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gay Ol ' Time has shown , and Light of Our Lives  --  who was trailing in seventh place  --  has failed to finish due to sudden death . A wave of low murmurs passes throughout the tent and its exterior and when  --  thirty seconds later  --  it 's quieted , it 's been publicly decided that Light of Our Lives was blessed with a fine life and has died honorably : for God , for country , for Gold Cup . I sip my gin and tonic and watch , half curious , half drunk , as a small cluster of girls in pretty flower dresses and boys in navy blue blazers with shiny buttons starts gathering at the rail closest to the horse 's lifeless body . After a few minutes , the congregation of eight-year-olds grows and multiplies to about thirteen mourners who vigorously debate the cause of the horse 's debilitated state ( " sleeping , " " tired , " " horsey heaven " seem to be receiving the most votes ) . It 's a funeral service of sorts , I suppose . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are undoubtedly the best-dressed second graders in northern Virginia : brass buttons just polished and bows freshly tied . They 're not grieving , that 's true , but I 'm sure that if they knew any better , they would be , and besides , the Gold Cup is this lavish affair , a celebration of sorts , and if there 's a way to go , this is probably it , among the hats and the cigars and the pearls . <p> But then a fly lands on Light of Our Lives ' black marble eye and the first of the eight-year-olds lets out a long , bellowing wail , which causes a mother to stop whispering about Annalee 's lifted skirt long enough to intervene and disband the flock ( " sleeping , " it 's decided , is the most probable cause ) . And I shake my head and I look at a single melting cube of ice in my empty cup as , around me , the world continues apace with some universal metronome whose beat , at least today , I 've been unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , see , and I 'm tripping through a tango . <p> Maybe it 's the bow tie , I think . After all , I 've never worn one before and this one ( pink seersucker ) is n't even mine , it 's Chase 's , and the lesson he gave me in tying it was hurried and unsatisfactory , at best . I could loosen it , maybe , give my neck a bit of slack , some breathing room . But on second thought I 'm not sure how these things work and a little slack could cause the whole thing to unravel and fall apart all together . And I 'd ask Chase for his advice , but his hands are otherwise occupied . <p> Or maybe it 's the empty cup . Yes . That 's it . That 's what it is ; it 's this sudden lack of gin , which I 've always thought vaguely tastes of pinecones but for some reason seems to be more distinguished , classier , than vodka . No matter it 's likely that intoxication has played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first place . At least if I 'm blitzed I 've got something else on which I can place blame for my disheveled hair and ill-fitting khakis  --  something other than myself . <p> Latham , Scripps , Howard , LLP 's tent is situated inconspicuously along an endless row of white cabanas that are hard to distinguish from one another , if distinguishable at all . In the Tanqueray + sun haze , I wander back into the tent 's populated interior ( " LSH Welcomes You to Gold Cup : Eat . Drink . Race ! " ) , which , if a person did n't know any better , he could easily mistake for a modern re-creation of Versailles , circa 1665 . I stumble through the throngs of plunging necklines and correctly constructed bow ties and make my way to the bar that , surprisingly , is empty , which I take as a sign of providence so I order another gin and tonic . As the bartender lets the Bombay waterfall into a clear plastic cup ( one finger , two fingers , three fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become matted with humidity and sweat , away from my forehead and lean against the bar 's high , wood countertop . The bartender  --  a young man about my age wearing a white dinner jacket  --  hands me my drink and gives me a nod . <p> " So , where 's your money for the next race ? " I say as he rearranges a series of bottles . We could be friends , this man and I  --  buddies . Both intruders in this club of modern nobility . <p> " There 's no formal betting at Gold Cup , sir , " he says with a sneer . " Enjoy your fifth gin and tonic . " Then again , maybe not . <p> I finish the drink in a single prolonged chug and order another before leaving the bar . Sixth gin and tonic , thank you very much . Comparisons to Versailles may be unfair  --  exaggerated , I think , as I make my way through the crowded space . After all , there are no kings here , no divine monarchs or bejeweled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sedated middle class . <p> " And so I said , Madam Pelosi , my apologies , but my cuff links are being polished , so you 'll have to settle for a shirt without French cuffs . But it 's flattering that my reputation precedes me . " Chase 's father  --  tall , impeccably dressed , Kip Latham 's voice cuts above the din of the crowd . I spot him in the tent 's opposite corner , surrounded by a sea of fans who erupt with laughter after each of his sentences . Kip thanks them by flashing a smile that 's been crafted by an intimidating team of orthodontists and dentists from only the best practices along the eastern seaboard . For the past two and a half decades , Latham 's been crafting his reputation as the District 's most prominent Republican lobbyist . And from the looks of it , his blueprints have proven to be one of the more booming examples of social construction . The man 's a caricature of success . His hair , flecked with streaks of silver that reflect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't changed tones in twelve years . He has a collection of loafers that has received pictorial treatments in Washington Life , Capitol File , and Esquire . To date , he 's the only man I 'm aware of who possesses a preternatural knack for bullshitting that 's actually feared , if not actively avoided , on both coasts and in portions of the Midwest . A lunch , a night at the theater , a Nationals game , eighteen holes ; they all meant the same thing to a Republican congressman : he was about to be Kipped . He was about to be had , about to be convinced , beguiled , manipulated  --  even if not for a single second he believed any of the words swimming gracefully from the man 's mouth and into the open air . If Mr. Latham had been operating when Jesus was preaching his monotheistic madness , there would have been no cross or martyrdom or moving rocks . There would have been a misunderstanding ; something that could be smoothed over with a little bread and a little wine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancing . No one would 've had to share a cup . <p> And so maybe Versailles was n't far off , after all . <p> Standing next to Kip like two silent Mazarins are the Pauls  --  Scripps and Howard , respectively . If Latham hosts the palace feasts , these are the men who kill the boars and stuff the pheasants . They 're stoic , I think , as I watch them maintain tight lips and stern faces through Kip 's raucous ( and likely inappropriate ) jokes . Specimens , really ; some kind of nod back to an old guard that I thought , at least before today , was a dying breed . They wear their graying hair  --  which is n't nearly as brilliant or as coiffed or as godlike as Kip 's  --  in the same plantation-inspired southern " swoosh . " Word is they both came from the Hill , where , a decade ago , they worked as chiefs of staff for two senators who had rhyming names . Kip managed to get ahold of them in a skybox at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lobbyist , and since then both Pauls have narrowly escaped indictment on four separate occasions ( one of which involved the death of a puppy ) . To soften their image as political assassins , both have had their wives ( Bunny and Kitty ) featured three times ( holding puppies ) in Southern Living . While Chase 's father has spent the past fifteen years sculpting the face of an empire , these two men have been building the gears and pulling the strings and flipping the switches that make shit work . It 's impressive , if not menacing and intimidating and  --  according to Chase  --  likely illegal . <p> And so I move , careful not to attract the Pauls ' laser gazes , toward the mahogany table set at the center of the tent and start to forage as politely and inconspicuously as my current state of intoxication will allow . For the most part , the spread 's what you 'd expect at an event like this : expensive cheeses , fresh fruits , scallops wrapped in bacon that are kept warm on an elaborate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heat I ca n't quite comprehend . At the center of the table are two large pewter platters featuring mountains of dark caviar . I stare at the tiny eggs . Thousands and thousands and thousands of them . Murder , I think , before piling a large mound onto a tasteless cracker ( spilling at least half down the front of my white oxford ) and directing it into my mouth . Absolute murder . At least an entire generation of sturgeon has been wiped out . If only the little bastards could know how delicious they are . The Pauls start looking at me . <p> " Do n't let the feds get ahold of that shirt , champ . " I stop picking the tiny beads off my shirt and look up to see Chase ( sans Annalee , hands respectfully in pockets ) . His lips start curling at the corners to form that Cheshire-cat smile . " Evidence of that caviar could get you five to ten . " I stop chewing and consider spitting the roe out while trying to mentally calculate how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't know how those sons of bitches do it , " Chase continues , " but they do . Dad says something like ' would n't it be great if we could get our hands on something none of the other tents will have , something a little edgy . ' And fucking voila ! The next day the Pauls show up with ten goddamned pounds of illegal fish eggs from Iran  --  this shit the UN 's actually banned . Can you believe that ? Fucking illegal caviar . From Iran . Iran ! Ten fucking pounds of it . Awesome . " Chase pauses for a moment to reflect on the power and the beauty and the contraband , and then starts noticing how much of those ten pounds are staining my shirt and how my eyelids have started dropping a little more than they should in the early afternoon and adds , " Well , it looks like someone 's been having a good time . " <p> A man in all white carrying a tray of champagne flutes walks by and Chase grabs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my chest . " Tough gig , huh ? " he says , motioning toward the field . A pickup truck has pulled close to the track and Light of Our Lives ' dead body lies in its bed , covered by a green tarp . " I bet Vance Alexander fifty bucks that fucker would win , and then he has to up and die on me . Goddamned horse . " The truck rumbles , then jolts , and then drives slowly through a crowd of spectators who nod to the deceased beast in deference . He gave it his best shot . <p> Even though the champagne 's become lukewarm , I finish the glass in two swallows before asking him where Annalee has gone . ( I half expect him to tell me that she 's waiting for him  --  madras skirt off ; a crumpled ball of orange and red  --  in an empty bus on the outskirts of the field . ) <p> He laughs . " She 's fine . She 's with her friends . Look . " He points to another corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who look just a little too much like her are talking in a circle that 's as tight as their large hats will allow them to form . Big hats . Everywhere . We wave and she waves back . " Man , I thought Californians were supposed to be laid back ! Maybe you should be the one we 're worried about , huh ? " He gives me a playful punch on the shoulder that , in my opinion , is a little too hard , a little too brash , coming from someone who 's fucking my cousin . But he 's mostly right , I think . He 's mostly right because I 'm the one who just moved here ( forty-eight hours ago ) and I 'm the one who took a year off and went back to California after Chase and I graduated from Penn and I 'm the one who 's in a new place , new city , new job . I 'm the one who 's becoming increasingly aware of my own displacement . Annalee 's been living comfortably and happily in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her two years older than Chase and me . She 's a pretty girl , I think , as I watch her awkwardly adjust the floral arrangement that 's been strapped precariously to the top of her blond head . Stunning , almost . Though , really , she 's never known it . <p> The flawless product of a mother whose obsessions include Vogue and cayenne pepper-based diets and a father who 'd wished for an Aston Martin  --  not a daughter  --  Annalee spent most of her childhood staring into a mirror scrutinizing whatever inadequacy had been pointed out to her that day . ( Too thin , too fat , too many freckles , not enough freckles , too much Gwyneth , not enough Gwyneth , etc. , etc. , etc . ) It was n't a particularly uplifting activity , though it was one at which she certainly excelled . While many young girls spend their days committing Hannah Montana songs to memory , Annalee could  --  without stuttering  --  give you a rundown of the stats surrounding her blemishes : this mole 's grown 0.18 inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ split since breakfast yesterday . When we were younger , I 'd found it impressive , if not entirely disconcerting . <p> As kids in Southern California , we 'd always gotten along well , Annalee and I. Our parents  --  namely , my father and his brother  --  lived close enough to each other to allow for at least one playdate each week . We 'd spend these mornings and afternoons and nights on the beaches of Orange County , dodging not only the Pacific 's crashing waves but also her mother 's attempts to convert us to whichever fad diet she 'd read about that week . ( During one such excursion , I 'd returned home and had announced to my own mother that I had pledged my digestive tract to veganism . She responded to my proclamation by cooking veal for dinner and telling me that if I wanted tofu , I was more than welcome to eat it with the rest of my burlap-sack-clad friends , but that while I was living under her roof , I 'd best check my dietary restrictions at the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family moved to Chicago . My uncle , who had slid comfortably into personal wealth after inventing an obscure ( yet highly expensive ) bike lock used by nearly every East European cycling team , cited business needs and promptly plucked his wife and daughter from their comfortable California lifestyle and set them down in the wild , wild Midwest . He bought a sprawling mansion in Lake Forest  --  a decision that at once pleased his wife ( thanks to the house 's sheer size ) and horrified her ( thanks to the house 's location in a region of the country known for its meat-and-potatoes approach to dieting ) . <p> " Business needs , " as it turned out , though , translated roughly to " abandonment . " After the move , Annalee 's father was all but present , opting to spend time with his family solely on long weekends and national holidays and the occasional birthday celebration  --  visits during which he 'd forgetten his daughter 's name after four fingers of scotch and two illegal cigars that he 'd obtained during his latest international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her monthly letters and during our weekly phone calls , but she had faith it 'd get better . Although he 'd never said it , although he 'd never expressed it , she was certain that she was still his princess , still his little girl . Because , really , that 's all she 'd ever wanted . She was right , I 'd tell her , even though it hurt my stomach to do so . He was just a busy man . Always traveling . Always working . What with the bike locks and all . <p> Despite the infrequent visits from her father and the constant harassments of her mother  --  despite all that  --  Annalee turned out all right . She passed through adolescence with unprecedented grace and crystal-clear skin , luck that my aunt would attribute to specific portions of kale she ate during her third trimester of pregnancy . Upon graduating somewhere in the top quarter of her high school class ( she was n't the brightest in our family  --  though she certainly was n't the dumbest ) , she attended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my part , she traded her judgmental mother in for sixty judgmental sorority sisters . <p> She took the hazing in stride , though , and laughed when the older sisters wrote " FAT " across her visible ribs with a red marker during pledging . ( " They obviously have n't met my mother , " she said during one of our weekly phone calls  --  a tradition we maintained through her time in Durham . ) Four years later , she graduated , sandwiched somewhere in that same top quarter of her class , except this time she was armed with a Bachelor of Arts in cultural anthropology  --  a weapon , my brother claimed , that would be less useful than the paper on which it was printed . <p> And it was . Or it was n't , depending on how you look at it , I suppose . Using an article she had written on the cultural significance of colored loincloths among tribes in Papua New Guinea , Annalee managed to land a job as a " fashion assistant " at a Washington lifestyle magazine whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be more than three digits . Together we laughed at the prospect  --  at this job  --  and she told me that it 'd just be a stepping-stone until she found something she deemed more worthy . <p> But this was when we were still talking weekly , before Chase had met her and had called her princess for the first time , before Belize . <p> I catch her eye again , and this time we share a smile and she rolls her eyes at me as she points to the bouquet strapped to her head . <p> Chase finishes his champagne and tosses the empty flute to the ground and as he calls me " champ " it dawns on me that I ca n't remember the last time he called me by my real name . " Let me explain Gold Cup to you . First , you 've got the south gate . " He points to the left . " It 's for folks coming from towns like Lynchburg and God-knows-where-else . Towns where people wear , like , J. Crew and American Eagle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Great Falls , Virginia . Or McLean . I 'm talking about Virginia Virginia . You got me ? " I do n't have him but I nod . " Good . Then , you 've got the north gate . " He points to the right . " That 's where the D.C. folks generally come in . But  --  and my bet is you 'll learn this sooner rather than later  --  not all D.C. folks are created equal . " He laughs at his own joke . " For instance , you 've got the kids who split the cost of a party bus to get them out there , throw on their only pair of Nantucket reds , pack a picnic , and call it a good time . " He pauses . " It 's cute . It 's nice . And there 's always some hot ass over there . State school girls . But it 's not us , champ . It 's Gold Cup purgatory . You 've managed to escape hell with the Virginia trash , but you 're still sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You follow ? " This time he does n't wait for my response . " Then , you 've got us . " Chase makes a wide , sweeping gesture with his arm as if he 's some feudal aristocrat showing some guest his plots of land . And I 'll admit , amid the madras and the seersucker and the tans , the plots are impressive . " Every year , Dad manages to throw together the best private tent at Gold Cup . Check out the Cap File this month , I 'll bet you a night of drinks that there 's a write-up on it , sans mention of the Iranian delight , if you know what I mean , compadre . " <p> " What about the actual races ? " I ask . <p> " The what ? " <p> " The horse races . " <p> He throws his head back and howls . " You kidding me , champ ? No one watches the races . No one . Think about the Derby . You think Jessica Simpson goes down to Kentucky to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She goes to wear some hat that cost her a grand and throw back a few mint juleps . I swear , " he says , shaking his head , " sometimes you kill me . Absolutely kill me . " And then : " C'm on . Let 's introduce you to the masses . " <p> If I was n't exaggerating , and if the Latham , Scripps , Howard tent is , in fact , a castle and Kip is its reigning king , Chase its dauphin , and the masses their loyal subjects , then I am the distant relative who 's a product of inbreeding gone very , very awry . By any legal standard I 'm drunk . My shirt 's covered in illegal caviar . I forget the name of every Susan , Bryce , Hunter , Valerie , etc. , whom Chase introduces to me almost before I shake their outstretched hands . And then I step on a six-year-old . I manage to spill the remainder of my gin and tonic down the front of an LSH associate 's wife 's Lily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the cocktail forms a sticky river of booze and lime and carbonation that runs through the bronze canyon created by her mostly inorganic breasts . <p> I 'm embarrassed . For her . For me . And in a moment of selfawareness , I worry that this situation , that this scenario and I may not be the best fit . <p> But Latham Jr . does n't flinch ; he does n't blink . He 's confident and cool and smooth . Standing at a perfectly proportionate six two , Chase Latham looks like he 's carved from marble and walks like he skates on air . He keeps that Cheshire-cat smile and continues introducing me to a sea of pastels and Polos that seems to worship him only slightly less than his father . Each introduction is prefaced with a series of disclaimers : This man  --  a prominent right-wing pundit  --  is rumored to have made a habit of receiving oral sex in the men 's sauna at the Sports Club L.A. That woman  --  who used to be a Democratic strategist but has since jumped ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which landed her a six-figure job at LSH . These three girls all slept with the same White House press secretary ( " twenty years older than they are , a Dem , and not the least bit attractive " ) . <p> It 's impressive , I tell Chase , how much he knows about these people and their skeletons . <p> " Currency , " he says , grinning . " Secrets are currency . " He points a tan finger into my chest . " The sooner you learn that , the better . " And I 'm reminded of my first semester at Penn , and the seven terms thereafter , when Chase taught me the difference between Andover and Exeter , loafers and lace-ups , pink vs. salmon , etc. , etc. , etc . ( " These things are important , champ , and you 're not going to learn them in a classroom , I can guarantee you that . " ) <p> We continue to bob and weave and cheek-kiss and high-five our way through the crowd . But such are the politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I watch him shake hands with a twentysomething in green pants with tiny blue whales embroidered on them . He could be publicly disrobing your cousin , who passes for a female Forrest Gump on her smartest days , and you could be on the verge of throwing him under the hooves of a stampeding horse , but then he slips his arm around your shoulder and he gives you the patented smile and he convinces you that his world , which is really a mirage that you 've been on the verge of touching for six years , spins entirely around you . And then suddenly you forget about your cousin 's lifted skirt , and that overpowering urge you have to protect her by telling her how many times Chase had gonorrhea sophomore year ( four ) . You forget about the time you invited Dianne DeWitt to your senior spring formal  --  after that whole Caroline mess  --  only to find her , an hour after the event had ended , snorting cocaine out of the creases in Chase 's abdominals in a booth at that club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are both about 93 percent heterosexual , you suddenly become a little jealous of your cousin and how she 's blessed enough to be intimate with Chase on a daily basis . <p> So he 's a drug , really . Grade A , uncut , pure , top of the line . Served up by only the slickest dealers in high-class clubs . Sure , he 's a little dangerous . And yeah , there 's a hangover  --  mornings and days and nights wondering why and telling yourself it 's not going to happen again . But rehab 's a joke . It only works for something like 12 percent of addicts , anyway , and you 're certain beyond any kind of doubt that you fall safely in that other 88 percent . <p> I wander around , high and happy in Chase 's orbit , until I 'm standing with him before his father and I become sincerely concerned hat a Latham overdose may be in my cards . <p> " Taylor ! " Kip slaps me on the back . " So glad you got in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pauls , who have since collected their wives , are n't smiling . They 're staring at the brown specks on my white oxford . <p> " He 'd originally planned to move two weeks from now , but I convinced him otherwise , " Chase says . <p> " Well , we could n't be happier . " Kip turns to his associates . " Mr. Mark was a classmate of Chase 's at Penn . Inseparable fromday one . In fact , they lived together all four years , two of whichwere spent in the Phi Delt house , my old stomping ground . " Hesmiles , but more for himself than in honor of our shared past , andthe Pauls nod knowingly , as if they 've heard this story countlesstimes before . " In any event , Mr. Mark just spent a year in SouthernCalifornia , which "  --  the smile  --  like father like son , " certainlyexplains his tan . " <p> " Welcome to the District , " Paul Scripps ( or is it Howard ? Andmoreover , does it matter ? ) says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Howard . " Damn . " And this is my wife , Bunny . " He putshis hand on the back of the woman standing next to him , who , forlack of a better adjective , is blond  --  just very , very blond . <p> " I just love Californ-i-a , " Bunny sings in some southern accentthat I ca n't quite place but that most likely falls somewherebetween Columbia and Charleston . " Is that where you 're from , Taylor ? " <p> " I am . From Laguna Beach . " <p> " Oh ... how exotic . " <p> " Not particularly . " <p> " Taylor spent the past year at home taking care of his mother , " Kip chimes in , the bass line in Bunny 's song . " This young man'sgot character . " <p> " Well , now . Is everything all right ? " Bunny puts her hand toher chest . <p> " It 's getting there . " I sigh . " She was n't doing well for a while . " The Paul , who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul . <p> " Oh , dear , I 'm sorry to hear that . May I ask what 's wrong ? Isshe ill ? " <p> " I suppose you could say that . " <p> " Is it ... cancer ? " <p> " Divorce . " <p> Bunny and Kip nod , as if to say sometimes that can be even harder . <p> " You know , a girlfriend of mine in Nashville got divorced two years ago , " Bunny says , as if the crumbling of marriages was a rare thing , as if more than half of American matrimonies do n't end in legal fees , therapists , and **35;1116;TOOLONG , as if it was , in fact , cancer . " And I do n't know how your mother 's coping , and I do n't mean to impose , but Candace , my girlfriend , she really turned to Jesus . " She smiles . Out of the corner of my eye I see Chase swallow his laughter and mouth " more champagne " to one of the servers . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . " I decide against telling Bunny Howard that , for Katie Mark , my mother , the word God is spelled P-R-O-Z-A-C and that His Holy Son , contrary to popular belief , is named Glenfiddich . A matter of semantics , I figure . <p> The introduction reaches that awkward point where neither of us has anything more to say about divorce or cancer or religion , so I 'm relieved when Paul Scripps leans in and tells Bunny that the next race is about to start , and that her favorite horse , a mare named Pretty in Pink , is running . She squeals and claps , and she mentions something about Molly Ringwald changing her life back in ' 86 before she begins making her way toward the rail . <p> " So , Taylor , when do you start your new job with Congressman Grayson ? " Kip asks , after Bunny and a Paul move closer to the course . Chase answers for me . <p> " Tuesday , " he says , handing me a champagne flute . " Champ becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 'll be great . Just great . John "  --  Kip catches himself  --  " sorry , Congressman Grayson , is such a close friend of mine . I 'm so happy that it all worked out . " He grins and allows me to recognize that I 'm indebted to him for my current state of employment . Which , indeed , I am . Three months ago , between driving my mother to therapist appointments , to the pharmacy , and to Neiman Marcus , I slowly  --  and then instantly  --  lost grip on my own sanity . And then , finally , after ten months , there was that night with the pot and the broken wrist and Jack White and I finally broke down and explained to my mother that I 'd be leaving California ; that I was too young , that it was too early for me to be playing nurse in a convalescent home for one . Against her best wishes , she understood , she had to , so we made an arrangement with my aunt and I began for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penn , I had majored in political science and French literature , and while the latter captured a greater portion of my interests , in-depth knowledge of Camus  --  while impressive at Ivy League reunions and UN receptions ( neither of which I 've attended )  --  is not exactly a marketable trait on the job market . So I brushed off this unopened copy of the Federalist Papers that had been assigned reading in at least six classes and set my sights on Washington . It 'd be good , I thought , rewarding ; an exercise in service and duty . I called Chase the next day , asked if his father had any connections ( a pointless query , but a formality nonetheless ) , and precisely thirty minutes later I had a job with Congressman John Grayson , of California 's Forty-first Congressional District . They say that good timing is everything , and indeed it is , because an assistant legislative aide was going to be attending law school in the fall , and had decided to spend the remainder of her free life teaching art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't care about the details , as he excitedly relayed the news to me over the phone on a warm February morning .

" I nod and say yes , yes , it 's wonderful  --  really wonderful , but silently I 'm thinking how , truthfully , it 's not such a mind-blowing convergence of events ; that , really , Kip is close friends with the entire Republican caucus . <p> " Yes , sir , " I say and take a sip of the champagne . " I 'm very excited for the opportunity . " <p> " Enough with the ' sir ' nonsense . " The king pats me on the back again . " You 're like a second son to me . Like a second son .

I pick methodically at the green blades , which is truly the only action that seems to suppress the mixture of champagne and gin and bile that 's mixing in the back of my throat . <p> " And Moscow was absolutely gorgeous , which I did n't really expect from a country that used to be Communist . " I have no idea where this girl has come from , nor an inclination why she thinks I 'm in any mental state to hear about whatever time she 's spent in the former Soviet Union . " It 's just a fantastic opportunity  --  doing advance for the vice president . " If I could just get my hands on some water , I think , that 'd help . And where has Chase gone ? " What people do n't realize about Cheney is that he 's really like a big teddy bear . A great big teddy bear . He loves to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Paternal is the word she keeps using . <p> " Yeah . I really get that vibe . " And Annalee ? Where 's Annalee ? <p> " He did n't mean to shoot that friend of his . Mr. Whittington just got in the way of Dick 's gun . I mean , Christ "  --  she lights a cigarette  --  " it was an honest mistake , really . " <p> " So , " I say , tired of hearing about the vice president 's honest mistakes with guns and lawyers , " how do you know Chase ? " <p> " Chazy ? God , I 've known him forever , " and I 'm suddenly sorry I 've asked . " Kip and Daddy both worked for ExxonMobil , in government relations , at the same time . Then Kip left to start LSH and Daddy stayed on board with Exxon . Chase went to St. Alban 's and I went to the National Cathedral School . You 've heard of NCS , right ? I was two years above him . He dated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends when we were in high school , and then of course he went to Penn "  --  she gives me a nod  --  " and I went to Princeton but we just stayed the absolute best of friends . " She stops abruptly . " I 'm surprised he never mentioned me to you . " <p> But I 'm not in the mood to hurt any feelings so I assure her that it 's likely he did and that I 'd just forgotten . So many names , you know . <p> " Oh , I know exactly what you mean . Just the other day I was at this happy hour at Daily Grill that was arranged by Princeton 's D.C. alumni association , and I was utterly appalled at how many names I 'd forgotten in a span of three years . I mean , D.C. is small and all , but you really do n't run into as many people as you think you would . I suppose it 's a matter of  --  " I cut her off and ask her if she knew my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year before her . <p> " Nathaniel  --  what 's your last name ? Mark ? Nathaniel Mark ... hmm . Was he in an eating club ? " She stops and feigns embarrassment . " Ugh . I absolutely despise asking that about people . ' Was he in an eating club ? ' It 's just so juvenile and faux pretentious . " The girl 's penchant for speaking in italics , combined with the thought of my family , begin to mix disagreeably with the Veuve/gin/bile cocktail , so I tell her that I 'm not sure if Nathaniel belonged to a club or not  --  which is a lie  --  and I excuse myself from the conversation . <p> Standing , though , does n't prove to be as easy as I had expected , and I sway and teeter before the gin takes over and I crash in slow motion to the ground . I apologize to the girl , who is now staring at me in italics , and I hoist myself up and brush off my khakis ( now stained with green patches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . My father always used to tell me that a man did n't get a second chance to make a first impression , which I always chalked up to him taking fortune cookie advice a bit too far . " They 're like business cards for twenty-year-olds , " he told me over steaks at a small restaurant in Laguna Beach the night before I left for Penn . " Your generation does n't understand that . They think that being on The Real World is somehow going to impress people . " He poured himself another glass of pinot noir . " Well , it 's not , Taylor . It 's just not . I do n't care what coast you 're on , or who you 're dealing with ; nothing impresses someone more than looking him in the eye and giving him a firm handshake . Ask Nathaniel . He 'll tell you the same thing . " He hesitated , and then poured me a glass as well . " Do n't tell your mother . " <p> I run over the conversation again and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can I uncover the part where my father explained the importance of caviar or grass stains or nine gin and tonics . These are the obstacles , though , that parents do n't disclose when they give their lectures on What Makes the World Go Round . Dad never mentioned the Pauls or Kip or St. Alban 's School for Boys . There was a handshake , and a bit of eye contact , and a world of eternal respect . <p> But then again , look how he turned out . <p> I make my way back to the tent and take post against one of the steel beams that 's propping up the taut white canvas . There 's a possibility that the beam wo n't bear my weight , I suppose ; there 's some likelihood that , thanks to me , all this will come crashing down on the hats and the glass flutes and whatever 's left of the felonious hors d'oeuvres . But thanks to my grand jetT in front of Ms. Princeton a few moments ago , it 'd appear that my feet are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gin and me , of keeping us up , so I roll these dice and take my chances . Water . That 's what I 'm searching for : water ; something to detox my thoughts and provide some clarity . Or some trace of Chase and Annalee , whom I have n't seen since the third race ( the sixth and final steeplechase is about to start ) and who seem to have been consumed and digested by the mob around me . <p> " Excuse me , young man , " a lithe finger taps my shoulder , " you would n't happen to have a light , would you ? " I turn around and am greeted by one of the more spectacular pair of breasts I 've encountered in my twenty-three years of breast-scoping . They 're large , but not unnaturally monstrous . Real , that 's for certain . Not a trace of silicon or salt water or whatever it is doctors are pumping into mammary glands these days . What 's attached to the heaving mounds is no less impressive : five feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I  --  in her thirties , maybe . Dark hair falling down past her shoulders in rolling waves . I reach into my pocket for my Bic lighter  --  a cheap orange number whose flame does n't seem to be glamorous enough for this woman 's cigarette . She takes a drag and exhales a steady stream of smoke . <p> " Thanks . " <p> " Taylor . Taylor Mark . " <p> She smiles . " It 's a pleasure . " She extends a hand and I ca n't decide if I should shake it or kiss it , so I do neither . " God , do n't you just hate these things ? " She looks out over the crowd . <p> " Absolutely . They 're the worst . " She could have told me the world was as flat as a pancake and I would have agreed with her . With this woman , no questions asked . She lets out another stream of smoke , as if to tell anyone who will listen that the PSAs are all wrong , that smoking is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a woman like her . " Can I get you a drink ? " She laughs and her breasts heave up above her dress 's plunging neckline . <p> " That 's nice of you to ask , but I think I 'd better sit this next round out . Lord knows what I 'd say to these women if I got any more vodka in me . " She motions over to Bunny and Kitty , who have started taking notice of our conversation , and have , in turn , started spinning a conversation of their own . " I forgot to wear a hat today , and apparently these women consider that a capital offense . " It 's true : she is the only woman under the tent 's canopy lacking some oversize headpiece . All things told , her attire is , at first glance , rather understated : a simple and unassuming white linen dress . But then , after watching her for a moment more , after watching the hair and the figure and the way the streams of smoke seem to finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say she chose the gown without those two particular adjectives in mind . " It 's not that I mind , per se . " She drags in on the cigarette . " I mean , Jesus , can you imagine carrying on a conversation with one of these women for longer than two minutes ? You 'd start sounding like some goddamned Jane Austen character . " Another plume of smoke escapes her lips . <p> " Oh , I do n't know , " I say , shoving my fists into my pockets . " They do n't seem all that bad . I met Mrs. Howard . She seemed nice . " <p> She throws her head back and laughs . " So tell me , Taylor , is this your first time at the Gold Cup ? " <p> " Yes . Yes , it is . " <p> She taps the ash off the end of her cigarette and nods slowly and smiles . <p> " And are you enjoying it so far ? " She eyes my shirt . " It looks as though you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hard not to . I 'm afraid I may have drunk too much gin , though , to be honest with you . " <p> She laughs again and tosses her hair to one side . " You 're fine , I 'm sure . " She nods to Kitty , who is attempting some sort of handstand in what can only be a two-thousand-dollar dress . " You could be in worse shape . " She drops the Dunhill to the floor and crushes it beneath a high , thin-strapped sandal . " But you 're obviously not from around here . " She looks me up and down . " Your bow tie needs a bit of work . " <p> " It 's my first time wearing one , " I say , fingering the edge of the seersucker cloth . " It 's falling apart . " <p> She grins . " Let me help you . " She leans her body against mine and wraps her two tanned arms around my shoulders . As her fingers work to untangle the tie , her lips graze my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my cheek sends my groin into electric frenzies . After a few moments that seem to linger dangerously long , she backs away from my sweat-drenched body , holding the bow tie . <p> " I never liked these things , anyway , " she says , folding the tie into a small square and placing it into a small gold clutch she 's holding . " Well , " she says with a grin , knowing exactly what she 's done and exactly what will not be happening . " I suppose it 's time for that drink . It was a pleasure , Taylor . A real pleasure . " I watch her walk out of the tent and down a patch of grass , her hips swaying with the attitude of a woman who knows that ( a ) she does n't belong at an event like this in the first place and ( b ) that if it were n't for the way white linen hugged the figures of women like her , moments like this , moments where young men were reduced to pubescent catastrophes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 's beautiful , is n't she ? " I turn to see Bunny Howard , who has suddenly materialized as some pink and green and bedazzled juggernaut spilling champagne and eyeing the crotch of my khakis , which now features a small bulge that my fists ( which are still in my pockets ) are trying to conceal . <p> " Yes , Mrs. Howard . She 's very attractive . " <p> Bunny nods . " It 's nice to see that you 're getting along with all of Congressman Grayson 's family . I 'm sure that 'll be helpful in the office . " <p> " Is that his daughter ? " <p> " No , " Bunny says , giving me a flute of champagne that 's been topped off to the brim . " That 's his wife . " <br> <p> The races end and I still have n't found any water . I 'm standing with Chase , who has missed a smudge of lipstick on the left side of his mouth and whose shirt is unbuttoned to a point that lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very un-Latham move . With one hand , he holds up Annalee , who is giggling and drunk and basically just this messy rag doll , and with the other hand he starts directing the guests back toward the LSH fleet of chauffeured Lincoln Navigators that are parked at the edge of the grounds . Thanks to alcohol and noise and general confusion , it 's slow going . When we finally make it back to the cars , Chase , Annalee , Ms. Princeton , another guy I have n't met , and I climb into one . <p> " Taylor , " Chase says once he 's slammed the door shut , " this is John Alexander Buchanan . Call him Jack . We went to St. Alban 's together . " Jack shakes my hand with little interest and forgoes any attempt at learning my name . " He writes that gossip column for Politik , so watch where you 're dropping your pants , if you know what I mean . " Chase laughs and edges me in my rib , which causes my stomach to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BlackBerry out of his back pocket and starts typing . <p> " What are we doing tonight ? " he says once he 's sent his message . " We could do something different . Like the Black Cat or something . " Princeton ( whose name I still do n't know ) manages to force at least one italic word into the sentence . <p> " Too many fags and hipsters , " Chase says . Annalee giggles . Jack rolls his eyes . <p> " Yeah , you 're right . All ugly people in black . " <p> " Let 's just hit up SP . You know that 's where everyone 's going anyway . " Ms. Princeton nods her consent . " Hand me that bottle of Veuve . " <p> " Chazy , you ca n't be serious . " <p> " C'm on , Caitlin , we got to pregame . We 'll be the only sober ones at Smith Point . " Caitlin . I make a mental note of it . <p> " We 've been pregaming since ten this morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , postgame . Whatever . We 've got to game , " he responds . <p> " And seriously , I hardly think any of us are sober . " We all eye Annalee , whose head is drooped at an awkward angle and who may or may not be drooling . <p> " Speak for yourself , babe . I could drive a school bus of Down syndrome kids with one eye closed . " Annalee lifts her head and points to her empty glass . " See ? We 're fine . We 're all fine . " Caitlin sighs . Chase wins . She reaches into a cooler branded with LSH 's logo and produces a sweating bottle of France 's finest . The driver keys up the ignition and Chase fumbles with the wiring choking the Veuve before he finally removes it and pops the cork . Bubbles shoot up like geysers . <p> Annalee gasps and champagne drips like amber tears from the ceiling . As Chase fills each glass I ca n't help but think of how the sound of the cork exploding from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and how the low growl of the Navigator 's engine rapidly accelerating sounds eerily like the grunts of strain and adrenaline at the beginning of a horse race . And I think back to Juliana 's lips brushing against my cheek , and then back to Light of Our Lives and his black marble eyes , and I start wondering if he had it right all along . <p> Copyright 2009 by Grant Ginder <br> Continues ...
