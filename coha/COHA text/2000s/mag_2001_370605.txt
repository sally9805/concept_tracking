Never had we imagined that the smile could get any bigger . But it did last March , on Oscar night . She accepted her award and the lips parted from ear to ear , from sea to shining sea , even as her memory grew dim . In her now infamous , rambling , exuberant , **26;13272;TOOLONG acceptance speech , she unfortunately failed to thank , among others , the real Erin Brockovich , the legal eagle whose fight for justice had inspired the movie that brought the star to the podium . Not even the desperate time signals from orchestra conductor Bill Conti could slow her down . " I was having an existential moment , " she explains , months later . " I forgot people and I feel bad . But I do n't wish I had written anything down . You ca n't go back in time , you ca n't fix it , you ca n't change it . I did write Bill Conti a little note thanking him for his patience . But I do n't believe in ' If only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roberts believe in regret ? For the gods have not only blessed her with a $20 million smile , they 've been smiling on her ever since 1985 , when she graduated from high school in Smyrna , Ga. , and headed to New York City to be with her big sister Lisa . " The whole point of me moving was to reunite with her , " says Roberts . Acting was an afterthought  --  " something that I could attempt to do in New York "  --  but fate saw her coming . On the count of three  --  Mystic Pizza , Steel Magnolias , Pretty Woman  --  Roberts was a star . Now , at age 33 , with an Oscar and a recent string of hits that includes the summer of ' 99 doubleheader Notting Hill and Runaway Bride , Roberts is flying higher than any full-grown actress ( yes , we are aware of Shirley Temple ) in history  --  a salary equal to her male peers and the ability to get behinds the world over into seats on opening weekends . <P> " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , raising an eyebrow and narrowing her eyes at a journalist . " That 's your job . " Duly noted . Since 1990 , Roberts has generated nearly $1.5 billion in domestic ticket sales . But even as she has become a regular part of our Friday nights at the movies , she 's become an integral part of our weekdays at the water cooler  --  most recently because of her breakup with actor Benjamin Bratt , her boyfriend of nearly four years . ( They actually split not long after the Oscars , but she still calls him " the greatest guy . " ) We follow her personal travails because we project our dreams onto movie stars , and so we want her to live happily ever after . A decade ago , as Pretty Woman 's naughty-but-nice hooker , she became a sex symbol for the safe-sex era . But we resisted her in less glamorous roles like Mary Reilly 's grim-faced maid .
