THE SLOW AWAKENING // In 1981 , when I was in my midtwenties , I climbed Mt . Albert Edward , one of the highest peaks on the verdant island of New Guinea . Although only seventy-four miles from Papua New Guinea 's national capital , Port Moresby , the region around Mt . Albert Edward is so rugged that the last significant biological work conducted there was by an expedition from the American Museum of Natural History in the early 1930s. // The bronzed grasslands were a stark contrast to the green jungle all around , and among the tussocks grew groves of tree ferns , whose lacy fronds waved above my head . Wallaby tracks threaded from the forest edge to the herb fields that flourished in damp hollows , and the scratchings and burrows of yard long rats and the traces where long-beaked echidnas had probed for worms were everywhere . Many of these creatures , I later discovered , were unique to such alpine regions . // Downslope , the tussock grassland ended abruptly at a stunted , mossy forest . A single step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the pencil- thin saplings on the margin were so festooned with moss , lichens , and filmy ferns that they ballooned to the diameter of my waist . In the leaf litter on the forest floor , I was surprised to find the trunks of dead tree ferns . Tree ferns grew only in the grassland , so here was clear evidence that the forest was colonizing the slope from below . Judging from the distribution of the tree fern trunks , it had swallowed at least thirty yards of grassland in less time than it takes for a tree fern to rot on the damp forest floor-a decade or two at most . // Why was the forest expanding ? As I pondered the moldering trunks I remembered reading that New Guinea 's glaciers were melting . Had the temperature on Mt . Albert Edward warmed enough to permit trees to grow where previously only grasses could take root ? And , if so , was this evidence of climate change ? My doctoral studies were in paleontology , so I knew how important changes in climate have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first evidence I 'd seen that it might affect Earth during my lifetime . The experience left me troubled ; I knew there was something wrong but not quite what it was . // Despite the good position I was in to understand the significance of these observations , I soon forgot about them . This was partly because , as I studied the various ancient ecosystems that our generation has inherited , seemingly bigger and more urgent issues demanded my attention . And some of the crises did seem dire : The rain forests that I was studying were being felled for timber and to make agricultural land , and the larger animal species living there were being hunted to extinction . In my own country of Australia , rising salt was threatening to destroy the most fertile soils , while overgrazing , degradation of waterways , and the logging of forests all threatened precious ecosystems and biodiversity . To me these were the truly pressing issues . // Whether we are crossing the road or paying the bills , it is the big , fast-moving things that command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a sideshow . The Y2K bug is one such example . Around the globe many governments and companies spent billions to prepare themselves against the threat , while others spent nothing ; and 1999 gave way to 2000 with barely a hiccup , let alone an apocalypse . A skeptical eye is our greatest asset in dealing with this type of " problem . " And deep skepticism has a particularly important role to play in science , for a theory is only valid for as long as it has not been disproved . Scientists are in fact trained skeptics , and this eternal questioning of their own and others ' work may give the impression that you can always find an expert who will champion any conceivable view . // While such skepticism is the lifeblood of science , it can have drawbacks when society is called on to combat real dangers . For decades both the tobacco and asbestos industries found scientists prepared publicly to be doubtful about discoveries linking their products with cancer . A non-specialist can not know whether the view being presented is fringe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that there is a real division in the scientific community on these matters . In the case of asbestos and tobacco , the situation was made worse because cancers often appear years after exposure to carcinogenic products , and no one can say for certain just who , among the many exposed , will be struck down . By creating doubt about the link between their products and cancer , the tobacco and asbestos companies enjoyed decades of fat profits , while millions of people met terrible deaths . // And many people have reacted with rightful caution to news about climate change . After all , we have in the past got things badly wrong . // In the 1972 publication The Limits to Growth , the Club of Rome told us the world was running out of resources and predicted catastrophe within decades . In an era of excessive consumption this imagined drought of raw materials gripped the public imagination , even though no one knew with any degree of certainty what volume of resources lay hidden in the earth . Subsequent geological exploration has revealed just how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back then , and even today no one can accurately predict the volume of oil , gold , and other materials beneath our feet . // The climate change issue is different . It results from air pollution , and the size of our atmosphere and the volume of pollutants that we are pouring into it are known with great precision . The debate now , and the story I want to explore here , concerns the impacts of some of those pollutants ( known as greenhouse gases ) on all life on Earth . // Is climate change a terrible threat or a beat-up ? A bang or a whimper ? Perhaps it 's something in between-an issue that humanity must eventually face , but not yet . The world 's media abound with evidence to support any of these views . Yet perusing that same media makes one thing clear : Climate change is difficult for people to evaluate dispassionately because it entails deep political and industrial implications , and because it arises from the core processes of our civilization 's success . This means that , as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be created . The stakes are high , and this has led to a proliferation of misleading stories as special interest groups argue their case . // What 's more , climate change is a breaking story . Just over thirty years ago the experts were at loggerheads about whether Earth was warming or cooling-unable to decide whether an icehouse or a greenhouse future was on the way . By 1975 , however , the first sophisticated computer models were suggesting that a doubling of carbon dioxide ( CO.sub.2 ) in the atmosphere would lead to an increase in global temperature of around five degrees Fahrenheit . Still , concern among both scientists and the community was not significant . There was even a period of optimism , when some researchers believed that extra CO.sub.2 in the atmosphere would fertilize the world 's croplands and produce a bonanza for farmers . // But by 1988 climate scientists had become sufficiently worried about CO.sub.2 to establish a panel , staffed with the world 's leading experts , to report twice each decade on the issue . Their third report , issued in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and industry leaders were slow to take an interest . Because concern about climate change is so new , and the issue is so multidisciplinary , there are few true experts in the field , and even fewer who can articulate what the problem might mean to the general public and what we should do about it . // For years I resisted the impulse to devote research time to climate change . I was busy with other things , and I wanted to wait and see , hoping an issue so big would sort itself out . Perhaps it would be centuries before we would need to think intensively about it . But by 2001 , articles in scientific journals indicated that the world 's alpine environments were under severe threat . As I read them , I remembered those rotting tree fern trunks in Mt . Albert Edward 's forest , and I knew that I had to learn more . This meant teaching myself about greenhouse gases , the structure of our atmosphere , and how the industrialized world powers its engines of growth . // For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an average surface temperature of around 57 ? F. On the whole , this has suited our species splendidly , and we have been able to organize ourselves in a most impressive manner-planting crops , domesticating animals , and building cities . Finally , over the past century , we have created a truly global civilization . Given that in all of Earth history the only other creatures able to organize themselves on a similar scale are ants , bees , and termites-which are tiny in comparison and have concomitantly small resource requirements-this is quite an achievement . // Earth 's thermostat is a complex and delicate mechanism , at the heart of which lies carbon dioxide , a colorless and odorless gas . CO.sub.2 plays a critical role in maintaining the balance necessary to all life . It is also a waste product of the fossil fuels that almost every person on the planet uses for heat , transport , and other energy requirements . On dead planets such as Venus and Mars , CO.sub.2 makes up most of the atmosphere , and it would do so here if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within bounds . Our planet 's rocks and waters are packed with carbon itching to get airborne and oxidized . As it is , CO.sub.2 makes up around 3 parts per 10,000 in Earth 's atmosphere . It 's a modest amount , yet it has a disproportionate influence on the planet 's temperature . Because we create CO.sub.2 every time we drive a car , cook a meal , or turn on a light , and because the gas lasts around a century in the atmosphere , the proportion of CO.sub.2 in the air we breathe is rapidly increasing . // The institutions at the forefront of climate change research are situated half a world away from my home in Adelaide , so for a time I flew frequently across the globe . One night when en route from Singapore to London , as we crossed the great Eurasian landmass , I looked out of the cabin window at a city illuminated below . Its network of lights stretched from horizon to horizon , and the lights burned so bright-with so much energy-as to alarm me . From a height @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathable part of it lay 16,500 feet below our aircraft . I asked the airline steward where we were . She gave me the name of a city I did n't know . With a jolt I realized that the world is full of such cities , whose fossil-fuel-driven lights cause our planet to blaze into the night sky . // By late 2004 , my interest had turned to anxiety . The world 's leading science journals were full of reports that glaciers were melting ten times faster than previously thought , that atmospheric greenhouse gases had reached levels not seen for millions of years , and that species were vanishing as a result of climate change . There were also reports of extreme weather events , long-term droughts , and rising sea levels . // For months I tried to fault the new research findings and discussed them at length with friends and colleagues . Only a few people seemed aware of the great changes under way in our atmosphere . And some people I loved and respected continued doing things-such as buying large cars and air conditioners-that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the year , however , glimmers of hope were beginning to emerge , with almost every head of government in the developed world alive to the issue . But we can not wait for the issue to be solved for us . The most important thing to realize is that we can all make a difference and help combat climate change at almost no cost to our lifestyle . And in this , climate change is very different from other environmental issues , such as biodiversity loss and the ozone hole . // The best evidence indicates that we need to reduce our CO.sub.2 emissions by 70 percent by 2050 . If you own a four-wheel-drive and replace it with a hybrid fuel car , you can achieve a cut of that magnitude in a day rather than half a century . If your electricity provider offers a green option , for the cost of a daily cup of coffee you will be able to make equally major cuts in your household emissions . And if you vote for a politician who has a deep commitment to reducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you alone can achieve so much , so too can every individual and , in time , industry and government on Earth . // The transition to a carbon-free economy is eminently achievable because we have all the technology we need to do so . It is only a lack of understanding and the pessimism and confusion generated by special interest groups that is stopping us from going forward . // One thing that I hear again and again as I discuss climate change with friends , family , and colleagues is that it is something that may affect humanity in decades to come but is no immediate threat to us . I 'm far from certain that that is true , and I 'm not sure it is even relevant . If serious change or the effects of serious change are decades away , that is just a long tomorrow . Whenever my family gathers for a special event , the true scale of climate change is never far from my mind . My mother , who was born during the Great Depression-when motor vehicles and electric lights were still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whom are not yet ten . To see them together is to see a chain of the deepest love that spans 150 years , for those grandchildren will not reach my mother 's present age until late this century . To me , to her , and to their parents , their welfare is every bit as important as our own . On a broader scale , 70 percent of all people alive today will still be alive in 2050 , so climate change affects almost every family on this planet . // A final issue that looms large in discussions is the one of certainty . Four nations are yet to sign the Kyoto Protocol limiting CO.sub.2 emissions : the U.S.A. , Australia , Monaco , and Liechtenstein . President George W. Bush has said he wants " more certainty " before he acts on climate change ; yet science is about hypotheses , not truths , and no one can absolutely know the future . But this does not stop us from making forecasts and modifying our behavior accordingly . If , for example , we wait to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do nothing until we are dead . Instead , we take medication or whatever else the doctor dispenses , despite the fact that we may survive regardless . And when it comes to more mundane matters , uncertainty hardly deters us : We spend large sums on our children 's education with no guarantee of a good outcome , and we buy shares with no promise of a return . Excepting death and taxes , certainty simply does not exist in our world , and yet we often manage our lives in the most efficient manner . I can not see why our response to climate change should be any different . // One of the biggest obstacles to making a start on climate change is that it has become a clich ? before it has even been understood . What we need now is good information and careful thinking , because in the years to come this issue will dwarf all the others combined . It will become the only issue . We need to reexamine it in a truly skeptical spirit-to see how big it is and how fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources in ways that matter . // What follows is my best effort , based on the work of thousands of colleagues , to outline the history of climate change , how it will unfold over the next century , and what we can do about it . With great scientific advances being made every month , this book is necessarily incomplete . That should not , however , be used as an excuse for inaction . We know enough to act wisely . //
