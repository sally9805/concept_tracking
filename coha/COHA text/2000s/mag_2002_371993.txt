This unusual off-Broadway theater piece explores the case of Susan Smith , the South Carolina mother who drowned her children by letting her car roll into a lake , then lied to police that the kids had been abducted by a black man . Joe Morton , playing the imagined culprit , and Sally Murphy , as Smith , alternately recap news reports on the crime and give voice to Eady 's poetic riffs on race and stereotyping . It 's sober , well-intentioned evening ( with evocative music by Diedre Murray ) that , unfortunately , gives short shrift to the most intriguing questions about the crime ( like why Smith did it ) and fails to engage us dramatically . <P>  --  By Richard Zoglin
