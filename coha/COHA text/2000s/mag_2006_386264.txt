A SIMPLE 4-WEEK PLAN Headnote No drastic changes - just 31 tweaks for a healthier , happier you ! BY AVIVA PATZ // Getting and staying healthy does n't have to be completely overwhelming - or take huge chunks of time out of your already hectic schedule . In fact , changing just a few little things can have a big impact on your overall health and well-being . To get started , try taking one of these steps every day , and by the end of the month you 'll have more energy , less stress - and you may have even dropped a few pounds in the process ! 1 Eat a more satisfying breakfast . Instead of running out of the house with a cup of coffee , take 10 minutes to eat breakfast Your best bet ? Jazz up ordinary oatmeal by topping it with antioxidant-rich raspberries or blueberries ( use frozen if you ca n't find fresh ) and 2 tablespoons of ground flaxseed , which contains mood-boosting omega3 fatty acids , possible safeguards against hypertension and heart disease . Not only will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost half the fiber you need each day in a single meal . 2 Just say no . Resist the peoplepleasing urge that plagues most women ( and often leaves us angry and resentful ) and politely turn down someone 's request today . Whether you decline to take on the lion 's share of a group project at work or to watch your neighbor 's kids , " adding one no a day reduces the anxiety and stress that come from being overcommitted , overscheduled and overwhelmed , " explains Rutgers University social psychologist Susan Newman , Ph.D. , author of The Book of No : 250 Ways to Say It - and Mean It ( McGraw-Hill , 2006 ) . 3 Snack at the vending machine . Sounds surprising , right ? It turns out that you 're better off getting treats - healthy or not - out of the vending machine man out of a stash in your desk . According to research from Cornell University , people who kept a dish of chocolates on their desks ate almost twice as many as they did when they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of sight and you 'll be more likely to hit the vending machine ( or refrigerator ) only when you 're truly craving something . 4 Switch your salt for a healthy heart . Trading in your regular salt for a low-sodium , potassium-enriched substitute - also called " light salt " - may decrease your risk of heart disease by up to 40 percent , according to a study of nearly 2,000 people published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition . Adding more potassium to your diet ( present in bananas , orange juice , beans and potatoes ) and trimming sodium can help regulate blood pressure , says study co-author Wen-Harn Pan , M.D. Another way to slash sodium intake : Swap herbs and spices for salt when seasoning dishes . 5 Prevent period pain without over-the-counter drugs . Skip the ibuprofen , and relax . Take a walk , do some yoga or indulge in a juicy novel during the first two weeks of your cycle to keep monthly cramps at bay . Research in the journal Occupational and Environmental Medicine found that high stress levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspiration . Do you find yourself turning green when you see women who are in great shape or who seem to be able to juggle a thousand tasks with a smile ?

" Rather than envy her , find out how she did it , and try her tips . " 7 Plan a trip ( and be sure to leave your BlackBerry at home ) . People who take a vacation each year have a lower overall risk of early death by almost 20 percent and a reduced risk of death from heart disease by as much as 30 percent , according to a study from the psychiatry departments at the University of Pittsburgh and the State University of New York at Oswego . When you take time off , do n't stay home to catch up on errands . Experts say travel distances you , literally and figuratively , from your burdens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or that hiking adventure you 've always dreamed of . 8 Get high on knowledge . A recent report in the journal American Scientist suggests that learning - those satisfying " aha " moments - triggers a cascade of biochemicals that gives the brain a hit of what amounts to natural opium . The greatest hit comes when you expose yourself to something new . Read that long article you skipped in the newspaper today , promise to do a crossword puzzle on your computer ( bestcrosswords . com ) or get through one round of sudoku . All these activities will help forestall age-related memory loss . 9 Get vaccinated . If you 're 26 or younger , talk to your OB-GYN about the new cervical-cancer vaccine , Gardasil . It helps ward off infection from the human papilloma virus ( HPV ) , which could lead to genital warts and cancer . 10 Sneak calcium into your diet . Many women consume less than half the recommended daily dose of calcium ( 1,000 mg ) , and 1 in 2 will suffer an osteoporosis-related fracture in her lifetime . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or drink a glass of lowfat milk Also make sure you get 400 to 1,000 IU of vitamin D a day to aid your body 's calcium absorption and to strengthen your bones . 11 Order in Vietnamese - tonight High in nutrients and low in calories , Vietnamese cuisine is typically created around lean meats , fish and vegetables that have been grilled or steamed rather than panfried . Commonly used seasonings include cilantro and red chili pepper , both of which are rich in cancer-fighting antioxidants - and delicious ! Steer clear of popular dishes such as deep-fried fish cakes and stuffed chicken drumettes , which are high in fat , cholesterol and calories . 12 Live in the moment . By practicing mindfulness ( concentrating on what you 're doing right this second instead of everything on your must-do list ) , research shows that you 'll destress and possibly even improve your immune system . A University of Wisconsin study found that all 25 participants who-focused on happy moments produced more antibodies to a flu vaccine than those who focused on negative memories .

Skip the vaccine altogether , however , if you have a severe egg allergy ( the vaccine contains a small amount of egg protein ) or if you have a fever ( wait until your symptoms go away ) . 14 Put aside your work so you can socialize more . Have n't talked to your best friend or sister in weeks ? What about that lunch date with your co-worker you keep postponing ? Make it a point to stay in touch with your old friends and add some new ones to your social circle . According to research published in the American Sociological Review , women today have fewer confidantes than they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're more stressed , anxious and depressed . 15 Stressed ?

But stressed animals who did not receive probiotics did . Supplements are available at health-food stores and in some supermarkets ( many are in the refrigerated aisle ) and should be taken as directed . Yogurt is also a good source of probiotics . Check the label to make sure it contains live active cultures - not all brands do . 16 Beat stress by holding hands . Sounds a bit hokey , we agree , but a new study from the University of Virginia and the University of Wisconsin-Madison shows that married women under stress were soothed by holding their husbands ' hands .

So put a handful of garbanzo beans into your salad , toss some pinto beans in with your rice , make a pot of minestrone ( mix kidney beans in with broccoli , kale or your favorite cruciferous vegetable ) - all contain beneficial compounds that protect against cancer . 18 Assess what 's in your medicine cabinet . A recent nationwide survey of more than 2,000 people found that nearly half have unknowingly taken a medication past its expiration date . Make a point to check dates before you take anything ; it 's easy to lose track . Better yet , when you buy a drug , highlight or circle the expiration date right on the package , so it 's instantly visible each time you reach for a pill . 19 Take a 10-minute power nap for instant get-up-and-go .

According to a study from Southwestern University in Georgetown , Texas , a moderate dose of caffeine could jump-start your libido . Researchers studied animal behavior and discovered that caffeine likely stimulated the part of the brain regulating arousal , which motivated females to have sex more frequently : A similar effect in humans is probable only in women who do n't drink coffee regularly .

We tend to blame " mommy brain " for the fuzzy-minded chaos that comes from life with kids , but new research on animals indicates that caring for children actually makes women smarter .
