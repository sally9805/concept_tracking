THE LAST PLACE I SAW WAS Venice . He said he wanted it to be somewhere special - and it was . The memories are so perfect , and whenever I want , I can take them out of the cupboards of my mind and look at them . The malachite green canals , the greenish blue of the Italian skies , the gleaming domes , the white pigeons . And my husband , standing brown and smiling , his eyes full of pride in me , and love - and , yes , sexual love as well . How thoughtful he was . They were a magical two weeks . <p> Our holiday was marred only by one brief episode . I do n't know why I think of it , but sometimes I do . To belong to our Sect of course sets us apart . All persons of deep convictions experience these odd occasional slights . One must n't dwell on them or feel bitterness , because bitterness does no one any good . <p> But there . She was a young woman in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were . Impulsively I went up to her , and asked if she would take a photo of us , my husband and 1 . 1 could imagine him , in the future , looking at it fondly , remembering our delight and oneness . But the girl edged away a little . Firmly she said " No . " And then , blushing and frowning , to cover her bluntness , " I 'm no good with cameras . Excuse me . " Then she hurried off . <p> My husband , seeing I was slightly upset , at once found a man , who was much more amenable , and took the shot of us , which I 've seen . It 's a nice photograph . Perhaps the girl was only truthful and did n't want to let us down . Yet .. I think she had realized we were people of a sect , our particular Sect , and , our beliefs offended her . And somehow , now , I sometimes see her face , with my mind 's eye , its blush , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So , using my special computer , I 'm trying to explain . <p> THERE WAS ONE other thing about Venice , and other places we went through . I did feel so sorry for the older women , the married ones . I noticed especially , their eyes were so dull and heavy and troubled . But I have n't been much outside our Town , and so I 'm used to our own married women , whose eyes are always clear and sparkling . <p> When I was a child , a lot of girls , including me , used to pretend to be married . My mother sometimes told me off for using so many of her scarves , and losing them in the woods . That was before we started Domestic Classes . Then , of course we had to practice properly . There were a few accidents , the worst one when a girl fell down the school steps and broke her ankle . Otherwise we laughed so much . But soon you get very proficient . I was , well , I 'm boasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And it 's stood me in good stead . Later , once they 've allocated your house in Town , for a month before you marry , you have individual training . My husband told me I was an absolute star , but then I showed off to him . I demonstrated what I could do . We sneaked in the house alone , when we were n't supposed to , you see . I think quite a few people guessed , actually . His smile did n't help , it was so broad afterward you could count all his white teeth ! <p> The only thing I never had quite right was the cooker - I 'm still working on that , but the splash-screen gets pretty dirty . just so you know , I 'm not saying I 'm faultless at anything - heaven forbid . <p> Some people , I 've heard , sometimes ask why . I mean , why we do this . <p> It 's so obvious that it 's quite hard to explain . It 's that thing about bitterness again . Bitterness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do anything about - and then hurting others , worrying others , making a mess . And then - you 're left with nothing . <p> We marry for life . Marriage is sacred . And everyone wants to be happy . My mother had the bluest eyes . I used to stare and stare at them , so clear and darting as she spoke to me . Aquamarines . I can still see them , though she died last year . it was a sad time . Dad may marry again , though . He 's still strong and young-sounding . I take flowers to her grave , and once I tripped , and this young girl , about twelve , ran over and helped me up . I could almost hear Mom laughing . And you such a star ! She was sweet , my mother , but she was very down-to-earth , too . <p> I can recall quite well what she said to me , when I was about five , and she explained . So maybe I should just use her explanation , instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are so sensitive , darling . They have to be . They have to be aware what a man wants , what their children want . They have antennae all over them , whiskers of feeling . And unfortunately that has a down side . It means they get hurt so easily . And then they doubt . And soon they just ca n't believe . She 'll say to her husband , ' You do n't love me anymore . I can see it in your face.Maybe he 's just tired - or maybe his love is tired . But she 'll read something so awful into it , And then she 'll nag and rave on , and drive him crazy . And in the end he wo n't be able to stand it . He 'll slap her - or worse , he 'll leave her . And what good will that do her ? And men , you see , honey , sometimes they do little things ... little things it 's better for a wife not to know . It 's much nicer if she need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you remember that silly son &; " Lipstick on your Collar " ? Well , the women here in Town do n't ever have to bother about that . Most of all , the thing they always see , with the eye of the heart , is how he looked at them last . All that wanting and care , that love . And when he tells you he loves you , why , he does . Oh darling , we 're so lucky . " <p> When we came back from Venice , I went straight into our hospital . I had the loveliest doctor . He was the kindest man . He assured me , there is n't a single sear , and he let me feel , so I know . " You 're pretty as a picture , " he said . He even flirted , and I must have looked nothing at all after the op . " Your eyes are green as grapes , Missy . I could look and look at those green eyes . I could eat them up . " <p> My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he just insisted . They are truly beautiful , I cried out when I saw them , in their velvet box . We displayed them with the wedding presents . I 'm sorry to say I think there was a bit of jealousy here and there . Well , I 'm sorry to say I enjoyed it , too . <p> And now we live so happily-all but for the cooker ! Never mind . I 've got years and years to master that . <p> In my mind , I can see my husband as clear as a painting , and the love and wanting in his face . And when he kisses me , that 's what I see , that 's what I 'll always see . <p> Oh , I know there are people out there , deluded people who perhaps even mean well , who try and try to get us stopped , or hounded out of the state , but if only I could tell them how wrong they are . Though I 'm blind now , because I 'm blind , like every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be afraid . <p> It was my twenty-first birthday last week , and my husband was a little bit late - only an hour or so . And I might well have started to worry , searching his face , trying to trap him in some lie .... But no , he was n't lying about all that at the office . I only have to remember his face , the way he looked in Venice . And I take his hand , and his lips are warm . <p> After all , as my mother said , " What the eye does n't see , the heart does n't grieve over . " <p> And I 've some wonderful news to give him when he gets back tonight . I 'll wait up , even until three or four in the morning . I 'm pregnant . <p> I wonder if it will be a girl ? <p> Author Affiliation
