The country of the tribes of Gaul extends from the sere and rugged cordillera of the Pyrenees in the west to the grandeur of the snow-capped Alps in the east , from the dank fogbound coast of the northern sea to sunny southern reaches where the balmy tang of the Mediterranean can be smelled drifting up through the mountain passes . But in truth , the lands of the Edui and the Arverni , the Carnutes and the Belovaques , the Turons and the Santons , and all the rest , their farmsteads , their cities , their pastures , are but islands in an ocean of trees . For it is the mighty green forest , cresting over hills and rolling down valleys , that fills the greater part of their world ; it is the oak that reigns supreme , not man . Deep within this endless oak forest is a round clearing , its grass sprinkled with wild flowers , mushrooms , mossy rocks . Waiting silently just within the ferny undergrowth fringing its margin is a circle of leaders of a score and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside a pole bearing aloft the sigil animal of his tribe -- boar , hawk , bull , bear , stag , wolf , and the like -- roughly carved in wood or cast in subtly modeled bronze or silver . In the center of the clearing , illumined by the bright noonday sun , stands Guttuatr , Arch Druid of all Gaul , a tall , slightly stooped man in early old age . His hair and neatly trimmed beard are silvery gray . He wears a white robe with no tribal colors . The cowl of the robe is drawn over his head , but does not hide his face , with its hawk-beak nose and its deeply set green eyes that seem to lookthrough this world and into another . He bears , but does not lean upon , a gnarled oaken staff as tall as he is . Atop the staff is fixed a fallen star , a roughly spherical piece of dark-gray pockmarked iron twice the diameter of an apple . He looks up at the sun , then down at his own shadow , severely foreshortened as the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-handed , the fallen star now a quarter of a man 's height above his head . From the four quadrants of the wind , their white robes trimmed in the many colors of the tribes of Gaul , druids emerge silently past the vergobrets and into the clearing . They form an inner circle around the Arch Druid , then stand immobile . Guttuatr grounds his staff once more upon the earth . No one moves . No one speaks . And then the ghostly-pale midday moon begins to move across the face of the golden sun . The vergobrets gasp as a shadow begins to cross the clearing and the forest beyond , as the sky slowly turns a deeper blue . The Arch Druid Guttuatr speaks . " As in the heavens , so upon the earth . The gods of night seek to conquer the day . Those who serve the dark war against those who serve the light . As upon the earth , so in the heavens . " The moon , like a mouth open wide , swallows an ever-growing portion of the golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tribal leaders moan and shuffle their feet in distress . The druids stand silent , knowing eyes fixed upon Guttuatr , as if waiting for some signal . Nothing is to be heard but the shuffling feet and softer and softer moans of the vergobrets , then the confused cries of day birds returning to roost and night birds awakening and the faint far-off baying of dogs and wolves , as the blood-red light of false sunset falls upon the forest . Then the night itself descends . The sky turns black and the stars appear , but the sun is still visible , its face a void of darkness , but rimmed in a gauzy light like hair and beard aflame or the fiery crown of a celestial god . " The night destroys the day ! " Guttuatr shouts , and brings forth cries of terror from the men beside their tribal standards . " The dark devours the light ! " And the druids begin a stately circling round him . Guttuatr begins a slow chanting . " But the Great Wheel turns and we turn with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is eternal , that which passes ... " " As in the heavens , so upon the earth ... " " As upon the earth , so in the heavens ... " " Let the Great Wheel turn with us ! " Guttuatr shouts , raising his staff high above his head as if to command the heavens . " Night into day ! Darkness to light ! Let the Great Wheel --  " Suddenly vergobrets and druids alike cry out , a great collective shout not of terror but of wonder . The druids abruptly cease their circling , and turn to stare at something above and behind Guttuatr . All at once the solemn spell is broken , and an unruly crowd is pointing at the sky , shouting and babbling . Guttuatr himself whirls around , looks up to see -- A point of light emerging from nothingness , growing brighter , and brighter , and brighter . A new star being born . Guttuatr 's jaw drops slack , and his eyes widen in awe , as those of a man beholding the visage of a god . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Druid whispers . The vergobrets do not move , but the druids crowd close to him , and one of them dares to speak . " What means this , Arch Druid ? " With enormous reluctance , Guttuatr slowly turns from this mighty portent . " This is the sign of a Great Turning , " he tells his fellow druids uneasily . " This Great Age will die to give way to the next . " " But what will --  " " No man of the age that is passing can see clearly into the age that is to come , " Guttuatr says quickly and more firmly . " We have conjured more than those of the world of strife should know . We must finish the rite before the heavens finish it for us ! " And he raises his staff aloft once more . " Behold ! " he shouts . " The heavens themselves declare their favor ! Light from darkness ! Day from light ! The Great Wheel turns ! " The druids hastily and somewhat clumsily resume their circling and chanting . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round , and round .... " " Let the Great Wheel turn with us ! " Guttuatr commands . And , as if to obey , the moon begins to disgorge the light it has eaten , and the sky begins to brighten in a gloriously luxurious purple-and-gold false sunrise . The forest awakens , and blue skies and bright sun once more look down upon a world of verdant green . The rite has succeeded . Or so it might seem . Half a dozen roasting boar and as many sheep dripped their fat on crackling log fires , perfuming the air with deliciously pungent smoke . Boys pulled planks of steaming loaves from the ovens and set them out to cool . Peasants brought in wicker baskets overflowing with ripe red apples , white turnips , and dark-green nettles , savory and freshly picked . Bards toyed with their harps , and here and there servants sang with them . It was the happiest day of Vercingetorix 's young life , trotting to keep up with the mighty strides of his father , Keltill , as they crossed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunshine . It was the day of the great feast to be given by Keltill to celebrate the inauguration of his year as vergobret of the Arverni . Though robust and brawny , Keltill was but of average height for a Gaul , yet , in the eyes of his fourteen-year-old son , he was a giant . His lands and his riches and his rule might have been passed down to him by the will of the gods , as the druids proclaimed , but what Vercingetorix saw in the eyes of his father 's people was something no god could bestow . Nor were the smiles that greeted him bought solely with the gold coins he tossed with gay abandon into the air , as if they were so many sprigs of mistletoe . Keltill was loved by his people . Keltill grinned and made a great show of smacking his lips as they approached the brew master 's cart . Seeing this famous enthusiast of his wares , the balding , fat-bellied fellow drew two foaming horns of beer from two different barrels . " This one I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , offering the horn in his left hand , then raising the one in his right . " But this one has a bit stronger spirit . " Keltill quaffed the first , then the other . " Well , which one do you favor ? " asked the brew master . " When did I ever taste a brew I did n't favor ? " said Keltill . He laughed , then grinned at Vercingetorix . " What do you say , Vercingetorix , would you care to favor us with an opinion ? " Like any boy of Gaul , Vercingetorix was familiar with watered-down beer , given when hot weather made milk curdle or cows went dry . But this would be his first taste of the full-strength manly brew . He took a hesitant sip of the " more flavorful " beer . It was thick and sweet . Under the watchful eye of his father , he took a more manly gulp . Now a bitter aftertaste emerged , which he found less than pleasant . " Well ? " asked Keltill . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Keltill handed him the second horn . This time , Vercingetorix took a full adult mouthful straightaway , and made a show of rolling it around in his mouth thoughtfully before he swallowed . Less bitter , less sweet too , and not as thick . " Even better ! " he declared sincerely . " Like father , like son ! " Keltill said , fetching him a mighty clap on the shoulder . " My sentiments exactly ! You heard our beer-taster , we 'll have twenty barrels -- of each of them ! " " Of each ? " said the brew master , eyeing Keltill skeptically . " About the money ... " " Name your price ! I 'll pay you double whatever it is when we 've both died and gone on to the next world in the good old Gallic fashion ! " " Very generous , Keltill , but if I , my family , and my brewers do n't eat in this world , we 'll find ourselves there for a good long while before you , so , if you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be that way about it ... " Keltill said impishly , reaching into the leather pouch from which he had been so freely dispensing largesse , and extracting but a single coin . The brew master was not amused . Keltill laughed at his sour expression . " Come along , then , " he said . " There 's plenty more where that came from ! " He held the coin , which Vercingetorix knew bore Keltill 's own portrait , closer for the brew master 's inspection . " Handsome , are they not ? " They passed through a gate in the wooden palisade that enclosed the inner courtyard . Within was the great round house , with its well-hewn plank walls caulked with wattle , its tall conical roof freshened with newly cut thatch for the occasion , and still redolent of earth and hay . The roof , as always , was crowned with a carved wooden bear , sigil animal of the Arverni , but now a bear cast in bronze stood on a pole before the doorway -- the standard of their new vergobret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already been set up and servants were setting out benches , dressing the tables with platters , and piling up logs for a bonfire . Keltill crossed the courtyard to a wooden shed . Vercingetorix had been inside and so knew what to expect , but the brew master did n't . Two artisans were beating lumps of soft gold into sheets with heavy , broad-faced iron-headed mallets , and two more were stamping out coins from the sheets with round-faced dies and tossing them into big leather sacks already brimming with the fruit of their labors . Keltill led the gaping brew master to one of the sacks . " Take what you consider just , " he said . " No more and no less . " The brew master gave Keltill a look of amazement , which transformed to greed . He dipped both hands in the sack and came up with as much as he could carry . He froze . He looked at Keltill . Then he slowly dribbled half his load of coins back into the sack and departed . " You just trusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I trusted his honor . This is our way , Vercingetorix . Honor is to be trusted . Fortune is to be shared . Else what are we ? " He scooped up a great handful of coins and stuffed them in the leather pouch tied to his belt . " Of course , it does not diminish a man 's reputation for generosity that his likeness appears on his largesse , so that those who receive it never forget whence it came , " he said . Then he laughed . " Not every notion of the Romans is foolish . " Keltill picked up another handful of coins and held it up before Vercingetorix 's eyes . " On the other hand , the way they whore after this stuff to the point where they will even let it buy their honor is pitiful ! " " Pitiful , Father ? " " Indeed ! They forget what gold is for . Do you know , Vercingetorix ? " Vercingetorix could only shake his head . " Consider , " said Keltill . " You can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not ride it , you can not even forge a sword from this pretty but otherwise useless metal . " " But you can buy food and drink and horses and swords and more with it ! " " Exactly ! " cried Keltill . " Life is not to be spent in the making and hoarding of money ! Meat is to be eaten ! Beer is to be drunk ! Horses are to be ridden ! A year as leader of your tribe is to be celebrated freely ! " With a wild laugh he tossed the whole handful of coins into the air . " Money is to be spent on the pleasures of living ! " By the time the sun had set , the festival had begun , and it could fairly be said that much money had indeed been spent on the pleasures of living . A horde of guests had arrived . Most were Arverne nobles , their families , and warriors , and the ordinary folk of Keltill 's holdings who had been favored with admission to the outer courtyard for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Gaul ; some fewer still were druids , who had the right to invite themselves to any feast , anytime , anywhere , in the lands of the Gauls . The drinking of beer was already well under way . Everyone had a foaming mug of copper or pottery , open barrels had been set out everywhere , and the fumes alone were enough to make the very old and the very young lightheaded . Not that they were relying on their noses to get the beer to work its happy magic . Nor , having savored his first true taste , did Vercingetorix fail to quaff his fair share and then some . The torches seemed to him haloed , the final handful of coins tossed by Keltill cascaded through the syrupy air like flurries of golden snow , and the music and voices melded into the wordless song of a burbling stream . Keltill 's entry was greeted by a collective cheer . And though this was not lacking in wholehearted affection for the man himself , stomachs spoke as loudly as hearts when Keltill strode up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keltill made a grinning show of hesitation . " Surely , my friends , you have not yet drunk enough beer to truly whet your appetites ? " he said . " Best we wait a bit longer before going on to the meat . "
