Playing Pilgrims " Christmas wo n't be Christmas without any presents , " grumbled Jo , lying on the rug . " It 's so dreadful to be poor ! " sighed Meg , looking down at her old dress . " I do n't think it 's fair for some girls to have lots of pretty things , and other girls nothing at all , " added little Amy , with an injured sniff . " We 've got father and mother , and each other , anyhow , " said Beth , contentedly , from her corner . The four young faces on which the firelight shone brightened at the cheerful words , but darkened again as Jo said sadly ? " We have n't got father , and shall not have him for a long time . " She did n't say " perhaps never , " but each silently added it , thinking of father far away , where the fighting was . Nobody spoke for a minute ; then Meg said in an altered tone , " You know the reason mother proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to be a hard winter for every one ; and she thinks we ought not to spend money for pleasure , when our men are suffering so in the army . We ca n't do much , but we can make our little sacrifices , and ought to do it gladly . But I am afraid I do n't ; " and Meg shook her head , as she thought regretfully of all the pretty things she wanted . " But I do n't think the little we should spend would do any good . We 've each got a dollar , and the army would n't be much helped by our giving that . I agree not to expect anything from mother or you , but I do want to buy Undine and Sintram for myself ; I 've wanted it so long , ' said Jo , who was a bookworm . " I planned to spend mine in new music , " said Beth , with a little sigh , which no one heard but the hearth-brush andkettle-holder . " I shall get a nice box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Amy , decidedly . " Mother did n't say anything about our money , and she wo n't wish us to give up everything . Let 's each buy what we want , and have a little fun ; I 'm sure we grub hard enough to earn it , " cried Jo , examining the heels of her boots in a gentlemanly manner . " I know I do , teaching those dreadful children nearly all day , when I 'm longing to enjoy myself at home , " began Meg , in the complaining tone again . " You do n't have half such a hard time as I do , " said Jo . " How would you like to be shut up for hours with a nervous , fussy old lady , who keeps you trotting , is never satisfied , and worries you till you 're ready to fly out of the window or box her ears ? " " It 's naughty to fret , but I do think washing dishes and keeping things tidy is the worst work in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so stiff , I ca n't practice good a bit . " And Beth looked at her rough hands with a sigh that any one could hear that time . " I do n't believe any of you suffer as I do , " cried Amy ; " for you do n't have to go to school with impertinent girls , who plague you if you do n't know your lessons , and laugh at your dresses , and label your father if he is n't rich , and insult you when your nose is n't nice . " " If you mean libel I 'd say so , and not talk about labels , as if pa was a pickle-bottle , " advised Jo , laughing .
