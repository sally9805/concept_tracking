Chapter One " Tell me your most secret fantasy . " Micki Carmichael swiveled in the surprisingly plush leather seat , nearly sloshing the contents of her complimentary orange juice over the sides of the cut-crystal glass . She 'd never flown in first class before . She 'd never been on an airplane , period . Made sense she 'd be nervous , right ? Made sense that she 'd jump like a red-handed pickpocket when her friend Danielle , whom she 'd thought had zonked out the minute she 'd buckled her seat belt ten minutes ago , threw out such an intimate topic of conversation . Secret fantasy ? How about making it from takeoff to landing in one piece ? " Go to sleep , Danielle , " Micki answered . " This is going to be a long flight . " Danielle pressed a button in the arm of her chair , extending a footrest hidden beneath the seat and lowering the backrest until she was nearly fully reclined . Micki imagined that before Danielle had run away from home , she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Micki had n't ditched her home with her grandmother , great aunt and twin sister ten years ago at age fifteen , she never could have afforded to fly in such luxury . The chair she would occupy for the next eight and a half hours was more comfortable than the moth-eaten mattress she 'd recently called her bed . " Oh , yeah . This is going to be a real chore to travel , " Danielle said with a luxurious yawn . She peeked one eye open when the flight attendant approached with another tray of assorted juices and coffee . " Add some vodka to that O.J. , would you ? " she requested . Micki instantly held up her hand . " She 'll take it straight , thanks . " " The vodka ? " the flight attendant asked , eyeing Danielle warily . Micki chuckled . No doubt , Danielle would have preferred only the vodka , but with Micki as her designated watchdog , she 'd have to make do with the orange stuff alone . " No , the juice . Thanks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rancid look her way . Instead , she smiled politely and accepted the glass from the flight attendant , then immediately placed it , unsipped , on Micki 's tray . Mumbling , Danielle unhooked her seat belt so she could dig through the bag she 'd stored at her feet , rising triumphantly when she extracted a collection of papers haphazardly bundled together . She shuffled through them , pulled one out by its frayed edges , scanned it , then tossed it beside her drink . " Read it , " Danielle ordered . Micki complied . " This is your birth certificate . " " Yes . And if you 'll make note of the line near the center , you will see that you are not my mother . " Micki shook her head . Her pal was notorious for going to great lengths to prove a point . Unfortunately , she had forgotten one important detail . " And if you 'll look at the line near the top , you 'll see that you 're not yet twenty-one . " " Bitch . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into snickers and chuckles , which only got worse when the flight attendant walked by again , a little pale after hearing their earthy exchange . God help the strangers who tried to understand the dynamic between Micki and Danielle . Hell , they did n't even understand it . When they 'd met five years ago , the differences between them had been so pronounced , Micki could n't remember why or how she 'd hooked up with the kid . Danielle had been fifteen , Micki twenty . Though they 'd both lived on the streets of Chicago , Micki had been close to kicking her bad habits and working up her courage to attempt a reconciliation with her family . Danielle , on the other hand , had just escaped her parents , a rich Michigan couple completely out of touch with their daughter . Micki had had a hard time understanding why Danielle had bolted from a house that sported two swimming pools and a full staff , but figured Danielle had had her reasons as much as Micki 'd once had hers . While Micki knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer than she 'd planned , looking out for Danielle had also kept her on the straight and narrow . And so far their connection had also kept hardheaded Danielle out of a coffin . Micki never could have guessed that she 'd morph into a guardian angel when , just ten years ago , she 'd been just like Danielle - young , alone and on her own in a world that enjoyed chewing up and spitting out misguided teenagers searching for independence . Independence . Micki rolled her eyes , then checked the seat belt again . Running away from home at fifteen had indeed put her on her own , but the word independence had taken on a whole new , more significant meaning now that she 'd finally gone home - or at least , since she 'd renewed contact with her twin , Rory . And with her twin 's help , Micki now had a decent place to crash and a job lined up . For the first time in a decade , Micki could make choices based on her deepest desires , not on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into an apartment in order to explore new experiences and improve herself , not to escape mutant cockroaches or to avoid an angry landlord chasing her down for rent money she did n't have . But as bright as the future seemed , Micki could n't really focus on her tomorrows until she put her yesterdays to rest . First and most important - she needed to deliver Danielle to the care of her brother , the enigmatic venture capitalist , Sebastian Stone . He 'd arranged for top-notch , professional care to address his sister 's addictions . And he 'd seemed more than willing to accept the responsibility for his sister 's care . According to Danielle , her much older brother had also run away from home , though Sebastian had done so by going to college at sixteen and becoming a millionaire in his own right before his twenty-first birthday . Micki could n't understand how Danielle could idolize a brother she spoke with less than twice a year , but she did . The kid rarely respected anyone more than a minute older than she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accept the help she needed , it was " Bastian , " as Danielle called him - although according to her , everyone else simply called him " Bas . " Micki had had to move heaven and earth to get the man 's phone number . She 'd even gone as far as paying Mr. And Mrs. Stone an unexpected visit . When Danielle 's parents had refused to intervene for their daughter , dismissing their child 's addiction to cocaine as just a " phase , " Micki had exploded . She 'd pulled every bullying tactic out of her extensive arsenal , figuring William and Dorothy Stone would either call the cops or help Micki contact the brother . Since they feared scandal above all else , they 'd given her the phone number and then had the butler politely escort her to the door . Sebastian Stone had been in China when the call went through , yet only thirty minutes after she 'd contacted Danielle 's brother from a pay phone just outside of the ritzy Lansing neighborhood where he 'd grown up , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her sister 's place in Chicago in the stretch Cadillac sure as hell had beat the bus . And when Micki had finally arrived at Rory 's apartment where she 'd left Danielle for safekeeping , Sebastian 's attorney had been waiting for her with first-class tickets to Paris and instructions as to when and where to meet Bas . Sebastian had even sent along a brochure of a beautiful rehabilitation facility in the countryside north of Paris and had included enough spending cash to break the bank . Not that she needed it . Micki could make do with very little , but money had been Danielle 's downfall , even after she 'd run away . One trip home with a sob story , and the Stones took their daughter back into their mansion , dressed her in designer clothes and ignored whatever troubles had led her to the streets in the first place . Usually less than two weeks later , Danielle had turned back to the streets in Chicago , armed with a wad of cash swiped from her parents ' safe or with bounty from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bracelet . Each and every time , she 'd steal enough to live on , with plenty left so Danielle could get high , no matter how Micki begged , threatened and bullied her friend to stop .
