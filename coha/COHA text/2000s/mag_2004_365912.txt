Taking Nexium , Prevacid or Prilosec  --  the so-called proton-pump inhibitors widely prescribed for heartburn  --  can keep acid-reflux disease in check . But a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association says they may put you at risk for pneumonia . Dutch researchers studied more than 360,000 patients and found that users of the powerful acid-fighting drugs were 89% more likely to develop pneumonia than people who no longer took them . Less potent acid reducers such as Pepcid and Tagamet also raised the risk of pneumonia , by 63% . Doctors say such drugs are so good at knocking out the stomach 's germ-killing acids that they make patients  --  especially the elderly and people with chronic lung illness  --  more vulnerable to the bugs that cause pneumonia .  --  By Sora Song
