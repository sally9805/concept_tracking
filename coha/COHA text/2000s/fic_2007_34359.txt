Part I A Red-Haired Man London , 1756 The Society for Appreciation of the English Beefsteak , a gentleman 's club Lord John Grey jerked his eyes away from the door . No . No , he must n't turn and stare . Needing some other focus for his gaze , he fixed his eyes instead on Quarry 's scar . " A glass with you , sir ? " Scarcely waiting for the club 's steward to provide for his companion , Harry Quarry drained his cup of claret , then held it out for more . " And another , perhaps , in honor of your return from frozen exile ? " Quarry grinned broadly , the scar pulling down the corner of his eye in a lewd wink as he did so , and lifted up his glass again . Lord John tilted his own cup in acceptance of the salute , but barely tasted the contents . With an effort , he kept his eyes on Quarry 's face , willing himself not to turn and stare , not to gawk after the flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Quarry 's scar had faded ; tightened and shrunk to a thin white slash , its nature made plain only by its position , angled hard across the ruddy cheek . It might otherwise have lost itself among the lines of hard living , but instead remained visible , the badge of honor that its owner so plainly consideredit . " You are exceeding kind to note my return , sir , " Grey said . His heart hammered in his ears , muffling Quarry 's words-no great loss to conversation . It is not , his sensible mind pointed out , it can not be . Yet sense had nothing to do with the riot of his sensibilities , that surge of feeling that seized him by nape and buttocks , as though it would pluck him up and turn him forcibly to go in pursuit of the red-haired man he had so briefly glimpsed . Quarry 's elbow nudged him rudely , a not-unwelcome recall to present circumstances . " . . . among the ladies , eh ? " " Eh ? " " I say your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bid me send her regard and discover your present lodgings . Do you stay with the regiment ? " " No , I am at present at my mother 's house , in Jermyn Street . " Finding his cup still full , Grey raised it and drank deep . The Beefsteak 's claret was of excellent vintage , but he scarcely noticed its bouquet . There were voices in the hall outside , raised in altercation . " Ah . I 'll inform her , then ; expect an invitation by the morn- ing post . Lucinda has her eye upon you for a cousin of hers , I daresay-she has a flock of poor but well-favored female relations , whom she means to shepherd to good marriages . " Quarry 's teeth showed briefly . " Be warned . " Grey nodded politely . He was accustomed to such overtures . The youngest of four brothers , he had no hopes of a title , but the family name was ancient and honorable , his person and countenance not without appeal-and he had no need of an heiress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sending such a draft across the room as made the fire in the hearth roar up like the flames of Hades , scattering sparks across the Turkey carpet . Grey gave thanks for the burst of heat ; it gave excuse for the color that he felt suffuse his cheeks . Nothing like . Of course he is nothing like . Who could be ? And yet the emotion that filled his breast was as much disappointment as relief . The man was tall , yes , but not strikingly so . Slight of build , almost delicate . And young , younger than Grey , he judged . But the hair-yes , the hair was very like . Lord John Grey . " Quarry had intercepted the young man , a hand on his sleeve , turning him for introduction . " Allow me to acquaint you with my cousin by marriage , Mr. Robert Gerald . " Mr. Gerald nodded shortly , then seemed to take hold of himself . Suppressing whatever it was that had caused the blood to rise under his fair skin , he bowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Your servant , sir . " " And yours . " Not copper , not carrot ; a deep red , almost rufous , with glints and streaks of cinnabar and gold . The eyes were not blue-thank God ! - but rather a soft and luminous brown . Grey 's mouth had gone dry . To his relief , Quarry offered refreshment , and upon Gerald 's agreement , snapped his fingers for the steward and steered the three of them to an armchaired corner , where the haze of tobacco smoke hung like a sheltering curtain over the less-convivial members of the Beefsteak . " Who was that I heard in the corridor ? " Quarry demanded , as soon as they were settled . " Bubb-Dodington , surely ? The man 's a voice like a costermonger . " " I-he-yes , it was . " Mr. Gerald 's pale skin , not quite recovered from its earlier excitement , bloomed afresh , to Quarry 's evident amusement . " Oho ! And what perfidious proposal has he made you , young Bob ? " " Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is all . Must you shout so loudly , Harry ? " It was chilly at this end of the room , but Grey thought he could warm his hands at the fire of Gerald 's smooth cheeks . Quarry snorted with amusement , looking around at the nearby chairs . " Who 's to hear ? Old Cotterill 's deaf as a post , and the General 's half dead . And why do you care in any case , if the matter 's so innocent as you suggest ? " Quarry 's eyes swiveled to bear on his cousin by marriage , suddenly intelligent and penetrating . " I did not say it was innocent , " Gerald replied dryly , regaining his composure . " I said I declined to accept it . And that , Harry , is all you will hear of it , so desist this piercing glare you turn upon me . It may work on your subalterns , but not on me . " Grey laughed , and after a moment , Quarry joined in . He clapped Gerald on the shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of discretion , Lord John . But that 's as it should be , eh ? " " I have the honor to serve as junior secretary to the prime minister , " Gerald explained , seeing incomprehension on Grey 's features . " While the secrets of government are dull indeed , at least by Harry 's standards " - he shot his cousin a malicious grin- " they are not mine to share . " " Oh , well , of no interest to Lord John in any case , " Quarry said philosophically , tossing back his third glass of aged claret with a disrespectful haste more suited to porter . Grey saw the senior steward close his eyes in quiet horror at the act of desecration , and smiled to himself-or so he thought , until he caught Mr. Gerald 's soft brown eyes upon him , a matching smile of complicity upon his lips . " Such things are of little interest to anyone save those most intimately concerned , " Gerald said , still smiling at Grey . " The fiercest battles fought are those where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what interests you , Lord John , if politics does not ? " " Not lack of interest , " Grey responded , holding Robert Gerald 's eyes boldly with his . No , not lack of interest at all . " Ignorance , rather . I have been absent from London for some time ; in fact , I have quite lost . . . touch . " Without intent , one hand closed upon his glass , the thumb drawing slowly upward , stroking the smooth , cool surface as though it were another 's flesh . Hastily , he set the glass down , seeing as he did so the flash of blue from the sapphire ring he wore . It might have been a lighthouse beacon , he reflected wryly , warning of rough seas ahead . And yet the conversation sailed smoothly on , despite Quarry 's jocular inquisitions regarding Grey 's most recent posting in the wilds of Scotland and his speculations as to his brother officer 's future prospects . As the former was terra prohibita and the latter terra incognita , Grey had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to other things : horses , dogs , regimental gossip , and other such comfortable masculine fare . Yet now and again , Grey felt the brown eyes rest on him , with an expression of speculation that both modesty and caution forbade him to interpret . It was with no sense of surprise , though , that upon departure from the club , he found himself alone in the vestibule with Gerald , Quarry having been detained by an acquaintance met in passing . " I impose intolerably , sir , " Gerald said , moving close enough to keep his low-voiced words from the ears of the servant who kept the door . " I would ask your favor , though , if it be not entirely unwelcome ? " " I am completely at your command , I do assure you , " Grey said , feeling the warmth of claret in his blood succeeded by a rush of deeper heat . " I wish-that is , I am in some doubt regarding a circumstance of which I have become aware . Since you are so recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspective , which I must necessarily lack by reason of familiarity . There is no one . . . " He fumbled for words , then turned eyes grown suddenly and deeply unhappy on Lord John . " I can confide in no one ! " he said , in a sudden , passionate whisper . He gripped Lord John 's arm , with surprising strength . " It may be nothing , nothing at all . But I must have help . " " You shall have it , if it be in my power to give . " Grey 's fingers touched the hand that grasped his arm ; Gerald 's fingers were cold . Quarry 's voice echoed down the corridor behind them , loud with joviality . " The ' Change , near the Arcade , " Gerald said rapidly . " Tonight , just after full dark . " The grip on Grey 's arm was gone , and Gerald vanished , the soft fall of his hair vivid against his blue cloak . Grey 's afternoon was spent in necessary errands to tailors and solicitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an effort to fill the empty hours that loomed before dark . Quarry , at loose ends , had volunteered to accompany him , and Lord John had made no demur . Bluff and jovial by temper , Quarry 's conversation was limited to cards , drink , and whores . He and Grey had little in common , save the regiment . And Ardsmuir.
