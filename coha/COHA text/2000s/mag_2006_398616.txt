Section : Iraq He can deal out death through his black-clad followers and roil the government any time he chooses . Why Moqtada al-Sadr may end up deciding America 's fate in Iraq <p> ONE WAY TO UNDERSTAND Moqtada al-Sadr is to think of him as a young Mafia don . He aims for respectability , and is willing to kill for it . Yet the extent of his power is n't obvious to the untrained eye . He has no standing army or police force , and the Mahdi Army gunmen he employs have no tanks or aircraft . You could mistake him  --  at your peril  --  for a common thug or gang leader . And if he or his people were to kill you for your ignorance , he would n't claim credit . But the message would be clear to those who understand the brutal language of the Iraqi Street . <p> American soldiers who patrol Sadr 's turf in Baghdad understand . They can spot his men . " They look like they 're pulling security , " says First Lt. Robert Hartley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mahdi Army in the Iraqi capital . The Sadrists use children and young men as lookouts . When GIs get out of their Humvees to patrol on foot , one of the watchers will fly a kite , or release a flock of pigeons . Some of Sadr 's people have even infiltrated top ranks of the Iraqi police . Capt . Tom Kapla , 29 , says he knows who they are : " They look at you , and you can tell they want to kill you . " <p> Sadr is a unique force in Iraq : a leader from the majority Shiites who has resisted American occupation from the start . He 's a populist , a nationalist and an Islamic radical rolled into one . Part of his power is simply that he 's powerful . Large numbers of impoverished Shiites view Sadr as their guardian  --  the one leader who is willing not just to stand up for them but to strike back on their behalf . " People count on the militias , " says Lieutenant Hartley , who deals with Sadr 's thugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mob  --  they keep people safe . " <p> The longer Sadr has survived , the greater his prestige has grown . Iraqis and foreigners who meet him are impressed by the transformation . He 's more diplomatic and commands more respect . He used to greet visitors at his Najaf office sitting on pillows on the floor . Now he has a couch set . His concerns are high-minded : he speaks of fuel shortages and cabinet politics . In the past , Sadr was shrugged off as a rabble-rouser and a nuisance . Now he is undeniably one of the most popular leaders in the country . He is also its most dangerous , for he has the means to wage political or actual war against any solution that is not precisely to his liking . He is driven by forces America has long misread in Iraq : religious sentiment , economic resentment and enduring sectarian passions . <p> And he is now a primary target of Sunni insurgents bent on provoking all-out civil war . Last Thursday , Sunni militants carried out their deadliest attack since 2003 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 200 people in Sadr City , a Shiite slum of 2 million people in Baghdad that is dominated by the Mahdi Army . Shiite forces responded immediately by firing mortars at a revered Sunni mosque in Baghdad , and by torching other holy places . Only the presence of U.S. troops  --  and a wide curfew over the city  --  prevented far bloodier revenge attacks . <p> More than anyone , Sadr personifies the dilemma Washington faces : If American troops leave Iraq quickly , militia leaders like Sadr will be unleashed as never before , and full-scale civil war could follow . But the longer the American occupation lasts , the less popular America gets  --  and the more popular Sadr and his ilk become . <p> To many , Sadr 's brand of Shiite politics  --  homegrown , populist and ruthless  --  seems a natural outgrowth of the ruin left in Saddam Hussein 's wake , and a powerful part of what Iraq has become . The United Nations calculates that an unprecedented 3,709 Iraqi civilians were killed in October . Death squads connected to the Mahdi Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , capture and execute civilians in cold blood , sometimes dragging them out of hospitals or government ministries . Corpses turn up on the street with acid burns on their backs , or electric-drill holes in their knees , stomachs and heads . Among ordinary Iraqis , the United States bears much of the blame for the bloodshed  --  just for being there . As Sadr put it to NEWSWEEK earlier this year , " The occupation is the decision maker . any attack is America 's responsibility . " <p> The story of the U.S. confrontation with Moqtada al-Sadr is , in many ways , the story of American folly in Iraq . It 's a story of ignorance and poor planning , missteps and confusion . Key policymakers often disagreed about the importance of Sadr and about how to deal with him . The result was half-measures and hesitation . But the story is n't just about past failures . It also contains lessons  --  and warnings  --  about the future . LITTLE MORE THAN ' MULLAH ATARI ' <p> MOQTADA AL-SADR DID NOT APPEAR on anyone 's radar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although he came from an important clerical family he was seen as a weak figure . Moqtada 's father , Muhammad Sadiq al-Sadr , had been a leading ayatollah , a rival to Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani and other top clerics . But gunmen  --  assumed to be working for Saddam  --  murdered the elder Sadr along with two of his sons in 1999 . Moqtada was 25 at the time . <p> On the evening after his father 's funeral , Moqtada presided over a memorial service at the Safi al-Safa Mosque in Najaf . A storm was raging outside . At about 8 p.m. , three men wearing suits and ties swaggered into the mosque . Their jackets bulged where handguns were holstered . They were smirking , recalls Fatah al-Sheikh , a family friend who was present . Everyone in the mosque knew they were Saddam 's men . One of the visitors offered Moqtada a package : a brick of bank notes wrapped in crisp white paper . " It was a message from Saddam Hussein , " Sheikh recalls . " They wanted to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They wanted to see if Sayyid Moqtada could be bought . " <p> Moqtada declined the money , refused to shake hands and told the men to leave the mosque . A cleric followed the men out , apologized on Moqtada 's behalf and accepted the money  --  knowing that to refuse it would mean a death sentence . Fearing immediate retribution anyway , Moqtada cut short the memorial and canceled two days of official mourning . <p> Sheikh says that for the next four years , Saddam 's secret police followed Sadr wherever he went . One hot summer day , Sheikh recalls seeing Sadr leave the Imam Ali Shrine in Najaf . Sheikh walked up and said hello . Sadr squeezed Sheikh 's hand tight and opened his eyes wide . " He was trying to give me a signal . " Then Sheikh saw why : two men dressed in dishdasha s , standing behind Sadr and near a Toyota with tinted windows , were watching . <p> Saddam kept a close eye on Sadr because the young man inherited a wide network of mosques , schools and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was focused on the impoverished masses of Iraqi Shiites  --  the sort of people other religious and secular leaders did n't have much time for . Even some educated Shiites dismissed Moqtada as a zatut , or ignorant child . Some called him " Mullah Atari , " because he apparently enjoyed videogames as a kid . He certainly lacked his father 's stature : in his theological studies , Moqtada never reached beyond the level of bahth al-kharij ( pregraduation research ) , according to a study by the International Crisis Group . But it 's clear now that most everybody underestimated him . THE TIME BOMB STARTS TO TICK <p> TOP AMERICAN OFFICIALS MAY HAVE been misled , as in so many other things , by depending heavily on well-heeled Iraqiexiles for advice . The outsiders , who had lived for many years in London or Washington or Tehran , disagreed vehemently with each other on what an invasion would mean . But some told Americans what they wanted to hear : you will be greeted as liberators , especially by the Shiites and Kurds long oppressed by Saddam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-known scion of a secular Shiite banking family . Another prominent exile was Abdul Majid al-Khoei , who was supposed to be a key guide to the Shia religious community . Both had been away from Iraq for many years , and were strangers to the place they had left behind . <p> Al-Khoei paid with his life . The London-based exile returned to the holy city of Najaf , where he was born and raised , under U.S. military protection . He quickly organized a local council to get electricity and water flowing again , apparently with CIA money . ( The CIA declined to comment . ) But al-Khoei 's father had been Iraq 's top ayatollah  --  and a bitter rival of Sadr 's father  --  during Saddam 's rule . Now the sons were competing for power and influence . Sadr castigated al-Khoei as a U.S. agent , and demanded that he turn over the keys to the tomb of Imam Ali , the Prophet Muhammad 's son-in-law . A gilded cage surrounding the tomb contains a box for pilgrims ' donations , a huge and vital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a colleague visited the shrine on the morning of April 10 , 2003 , an angry mob attacked them with grenades , guns and swords . " Long live Moqtada al-Sadr ! " the mob cried out . Al-Khoei was stabbed repeatedly , then tied up and dragged to the doorstep of Sadr 's headquarters in Najaf , where he was still alive . A subsequent investigation by an Iraqi judge found that Sadr himself gave the order to finish him off : " Take him away and kill him in your own special way . " <p> Yet it was n't clear at the time of the killing what Sadr 's personal role was , and " we did n't want one of our first acts in country to be taking out one of the most popular leaders , " says a U.S. military officer familiar with Army intelligence on Sadr . The officer , who did not want to be named discussing intelligence matters , says the Army was worried about provoking riots . When Sadr 's father was killed in 1999 , Saddam violently crushed protests by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands would take to the streets in Nasiriya , Karbala and Baghdad . It always comes back to that  --  not enough guys on the ground . " <p> One courageous Iraqi judge , Raid Juhi , doggedly investigated the case . He exhumed the bodies of al-Khoei and his colleague , and wrote up a confidential arrest warrant for Sadr in August 2003 . " From that moment through April 2004 , the issue was whether we were going to enforce the arrest warrant , " says Dan Senor , a senior official in the Coalition Provisional Authority at the time . <p> The CPA , the Pentagon and the military on the ground were in disagreement . The Marines in southern Iraq were particularly wary of stirring up trouble . As it was , the United States was preparing to hand off the area around Najaf to a multinational force with troops from Spain and Central America . Still , the Coalition had a secret arrest plan , and momentum toward nabbing Sadr was building . " The pivotal moment was Aug. 19 , 2003 , " says Senor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ensuring that the operation was seen as Iraqi , executed on an Iraqi arrest warrant . I remember it was late afternoon and we had just received a snowflake from U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld . with nine different questions , rehashing how we were going to do this , to make sure it was not seen as an American operation . " ( A " snowflake " was a Rumsfeld memo . ) <p> Suddenly word came that insurgents had detonated a massive truck bomb at the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad . Senor recalls rushing to the scene with Hume Horan , a top U.S. diplomat and Arabist . Horan leaned over to Senor and said , " We should take down Sadr now , when no one 's looking . " But there was enough chaos to deal with already . The U.N . bombing was " a huge distraction , " says Senor , " and the Sadr operation was forgotten . " TAKING ON IRAQ 'S NEW TALIBAN <p> THE U.S. INVASION HAD DESTROYED AN economy already crippled by years of international sanctions . Countless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent change but also poor and fearful . They wanted to be part of the new order  --  whatever it would be . The country was also awash in guns and other weapons , including those looted from Saddam 's vast and unsecured arms depots . The Sadrist network was perfectly positioned to capitalize on the situation . Sadr himself was determined to lead a national movement  --  using a potent mixture of anti-occupation militancy and millennial preaching about the coming of the mysterious 12th imam , who Shiites believe will save mankind . " Moqtada is absolutely hooked on the concept of the reappearance of the Mahdi , " says Amatzia Baram , the director of the Ezri Center at Haifa University . <p> The first sighting of black-clad militiamen identifying themselves as part of Mahdi Army seems to have come in September 2003 in the southern town of Kufah . " I do not care what the Americans have to say about this , and I never did , " said Sadr when asked about the new militia by reporters later that month . " Only the Iraqi people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The U.S. military , fighting an ever-growing insurgency by the minority Sunnis , who had lost power with Saddam 's downfall , did n't want to instigate a two-front war . But that left the United States without a strategy . If American forces were n't going to fight Sadr , it made sense to try to entice him into a political process . But other Iraqi leaders , including prominent Shiites , may have opposed that idea . <p> In the winter of 2004 , a senior adviser to Ambassador Paul Bremer , the American proconsul in Iraq , was traveling in the south , meeting with friendly clerics and community leaders . " I could see how frightened they were of Sadr and his Mahdi Army , " recalls the aide , Larry Diamond . " I was driven past an area , a kind of compound where his black-clad army was training for the upcoming revolution to seize power and take over . It just dawned on me that these people were going to make this place an authoritarian hell of a new sort , Taliban style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process . " <p> Diamond went to Bremer and gave him his assessment : the United States urgently needed to act against Sadr . Bremer responded that he was waiting for a new plan from Coalition forces . " I first wanted to go after him when he had probably fewer than 200 followers , " Bremer recalled in an interview with NEWSWEEK last week . " I could n't make it happen . the Marines were resisting doing anything . " But in the meantime , on March 28 , 2004 , Bremer suspended publication of Sadr 's newspaper after it ran an editorial praising the 9/11 attacks on America as a " blessing from God . " <p> The response was swift : mass demonstrations , which led to the first of two Sadr uprisings in 2004 . In a final meeting between Diamond and Bremer on April 1 , Diamond pressed the point that the United States needed more troops in Iraq . It was around 8 p.m. , and Bremer 's dinner was sitting on a tray un- eaten . He looked exhausted . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Diamond . " In retrospect , I think he had gone to the well on this issue of more troops during 2003 , had gotten nowhere . and had just resigned himself to the fact that these troops just were n't going to come . I think the tragedy is that everyone just gave up . " <p> When fighting did break out , American forces hammered the Mahdi Army in Baghdad and Najaf  --  first in the spring and then again , after a broken ceasefire , in the late summer . Some of the worst fighting came in August , as Sadr 's militiamen made their stand around the Imam Ali Shrine in Najaf . They turned the area into a no-go zone , sniping at any sign of movement . U.S. forces retaliated by laying waste to large swaths of central Najaf . In the end , Ayatollah Sistani brought his influence to bear on the renegade cleric and encouraged a ceasefire . Attempts to enforce the arrest warrant against Sadr and several aides were dropped , and Sadr 's forces disarmed in Najaf or headed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ militants were shellshocked . Others bragged about how they had fought back tanks with AK-47s , or disabled Humvees with a single grenade . Scores of militiamen were dead , but Sadr 's prestige was , if anything , enhanced : he had fought the mighty United States to a stalemate . GETTING SADR INSIDE THE TENT <p> SADR NEEDED A NEW STRATEGY , HOWEVER . He was n't strong enough to defeat the occupier head-on , nor could he eliminate his Iraqi rivals . So he took up what he calls " political resistance "  --  working from within the system . Chalabi played an important role here . Washington 's favorite Iraqi had found that he had little popularity in his homeland , so he was seeking alliances . Chalabi also felt , as did many other Iraqis and Americans , that it was better to bring Sadr inside the process than to have him trying to destroy it . " Sadr is respected because of his lineage and because he speaks for the disenfranchised , the scared and the angry , " says a Chalabi aide , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the subject . " In that sort of situation , it makes absolute sense to try to get him inside the system . " <p> Sadr made the most of the opening . Politicians in his Sadr bloc won 23 of 275 seats in the January 2005 elections and , after fresh voting nearly a year later , now hold 30 seats . In both cases , because of divisions between other large Shiite , Kurdish and Sunni parties , Sadr was able to play kingmaker . Two prime ministers since 2005  --  Ibrahim Jaafari and the current Iraqi leader , Nuri al-Maliki  --  have depended on his swing votes for their majority . But Sadr himself stayed out of government , and kept his distance . That way he could pursue a dual strategy  --  rebuilding his militia even as he capitalized on his control of key ministries , like Health and Transportation , to provide services to the poor and jobs to his followers . <p> The Sunni insurgents were pursuing a new strategy , too . In early 2004 , U.S. forces had intercepted a worried letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to Osama bin Laden . Zarqawi fretted that his fight against American forces was going poorly . But he had a plan : " If we succeed in dragging the Shiites into the arena of sectarian war , it will become possible to awaken the inattentive Sunnis as they feel imminent danger , " he wrote . <p> Throughout 2005 , Sunni insurgents launched increasingly vicious attacks on Shiite civilians and holy places . Sistani regularly called on his followers to exercise restraint , which they did with remarkable forbearance . But Sadr , who had long positioned himself as an Iraqi nationalist  --  and who had cooperated with Sunni fighters in the early stages of the insurgency  --  now publicly called for Sunnis to disavow Zarqawi . New battle lines were being drawn . <p> The turning point came on Feb. 22 , 2006 , when assailants bombed the golden-domed Askariya Shrine in Samarra . This was the burial place of the 10th and 11th imams , and one of the holiest sites of the Shia faith . After the Samarra bombing , many Shiites felt compelled to lash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they decided that they 'd rather have a dirty brawler in their corner ( like Sadr ) than a gray-bearded holy man ( like Sistani ) . " We have courage , large amounts of ammunition , good leaders , and it is a religious duty , " says Ali Mijbil , a 26-year-old mechanic who serves in the Mahdi Army . " So why do n't we fight them ? We 've been kept under Sunni rule for more than 14 centuries . It is the proper time to rule ourselves now . " <p> Sadr still insists his main fight is with foreign invaders . He 's the one Shia leader who has opposed the U.S. occupation from the beginning , and who has continued to call for a strict timetable for American withdrawal . An overwhelming majority of Iraqis now agree with him . A September poll by WorldPublicOpinion.org found that 63 percent of 501 Iraqi Shiites surveyed supported attacks against Americans . Even in Baghdad , where ethnic tensions are worst , Shiites agree with Sunnis on one thing : the poll found that 80 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within a year . That number has changed dramatically in a matter of months . A January poll found that most Shiites wanted U.S.-led troops to be reduced only " as the security situation improves . " <p> In Washington , some politicians still talk about " victory , " while others aim only to stabilize the country and leave with some semblance of dignity . Many in the U.S. capital are dusting off yesterday 's proposals for tomorrow 's problems  --  more training , more troops , disarming the militias , more stability in Baghdad . The GOP presidential front runner for 2008 , John McCain , would prefer to increase the number of U.S. troops in Iraq by 20,000 , at least temporarily . He has also called for Sadr to be " taken out . " But it may be too late . <p> The movement may now be more important than the man . Sadr " is faced with a common problem , " says Toby Dodge of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London . " He ca n't control the use of his brand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elder followers of Sadr 's father have broken away , disillusioned with the son . And some young toughs seem to be freelancing where they can . Renegade factions could eventually threaten Sadr 's power . If he were to fall , " you 'll end up with 30 different movements , " says Vali Nasr , a scholar and author who has briefed the Bush administration on Iraq . " There are 30 chieftains who have a tremendous amount of local power . If you remove him , there will be a scramble for who will inherit this movement . It 's a great danger doing that . You may actually make your life much more difficult . " HOW THE MAHDI ARMY WORKS <p> FOR NOW , SADR AND HIS MAHDI ARMY have the initiative . They can stir up trouble without much fear of retribution . A case in point : When kidnappers grabbed an Iraqi-American translator in Baghdad last month , U.S. soldiers sealed off the Sadr City neighborhood where they believed he was being held . But Prime Minister Maliki  --  who depends on Sadr for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roadblocks . Maliki has also forced the U.S. military to release men picked up during raids in Sadr City on suspicion of belonging to Shiite death squads . <p> When the U.S. fails to respond to provocation , it loses credibility . And when it does respond , it can also lose . Last week , before the massive car-bomb attacks , U.S. and Iraqi forces carried out a pinprick raid in Sadr City to get intelligence on the kidnapped military translator , Ahmed Qusai al-Taayie . Like so many other U.S. military strikes in Iraq , however , it came at a price . American forces captured seven militiamen , including one who might have information on al-Taayie . But police said a young boy was among three people killed in the raid . A member of Parliament from Sadr 's movement promptly showed up at the morgue , and held the corpse of the boy in his arms as he railed against the American occupation . <p> U.S. forces have tried hard to win hearts and minds . They 've spent $120.9 million on completed construction projects in Sadr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines  --  and projects worth an additional $197 million are underway . But the United States does n't always get credit for the good works . When the Americans doled out cash to construct four health clinics in Sadr City during the past year , Sadr 's men quickly removed any hint of U.S. involvement . They also put up signs giving all credit to their boss , according to Lt. Zeroy Lawson , an Army intelligence officer who works in the area . <p> The Mahdi Army has other sources of cash . It 's taken control of gas stations throughout large parts of Baghdad , and dominates the Shia trade in propane-gas canisters , which Iraqis use for cooking . Sometimes the militiamen sell the propane at a premium , earning healthy profits ; at other times they sell it at well below market rates , earning gratitude from the poor and unemployed . <p> A key source of Sadr 's income is Muslim tithes  --  or khom s  --  collected at mosques . But his militiamen also run extortion and protection rackets  --  demanding money to keep certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tough neighborhood , who did not want to reveal his name out of fear , says he pays the local Mahdi Army the equivalent of $13 a month for protection . <p> Analysts believe that Iran has also provided support to Sadr , but not much . Tehran began supplying Shia insurgents , including the Mahdi Army , with a special type of roadside bomb , using a shaped charge , in May 2005 . These are often disguised as rocks and are easy to manufacture locally . But diplomats say they are made to the exact design perfected by Iranian intelligence and supplied to Lebanese Hizbullah in the 1980s . <p> Yet Tehran 's main Shiite clients in Iraq are rivals of Sadr , who is often critical of Persian influence . Sadr worries that Iran may be trying to infiltrate his movement , and he 's almost surely right . Fatah al-Sheikh , who is close to Sadr , says the boss sent a private letter to loyal imams around Baghdad in the past two weeks identifying 10 followers he believed were suspect . They had been using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really tools of Iranian intelligence , says Sheikh . <p> Sadr has tried to distance himself from atrocities , insisting that they 're carried out by renegades or impostors . Many Sunnis , to whom Sadr has become a dark symbol of Shiite perfidy , do n't buy it . " If he says , ' Kill Alusi , ' I will be killed , " says Mithal al-Alusi , a moderate Sunni member of Parliament . " If he says , ' Do n't kill Alusi , ' I will not be killed . Nobody can go against his orders or wishes . " The Association of Muslim Scholars , which is loosely linked with Sunni insurgents , says the Mahdi Army has attacked some 200 Sunni mosques , and killed more than 260 imams and mosque workers . <p> All the killings will be remembered , and it will be a miracle if they go unanswered . Memories of martyrdom  --  and the desire for revenge  --  can last forever . Last Friday marked the anniversary , on the Islamic calendar , of the killing of Muhammad Sadiq al-Sadr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bombings , Moqtada told government officials that he was out of the country . But that seems to have been a feint  --  to keep possible enemies off balance . In fact , he appeared at the Kufah Mosque , where his father used to lead worshipers in chants of " No , no to America ; no , no to Israel ; no , no to the Devil ! " <p> As word spread that Moqtada would lead prayers , people crowded into the mosque , most of them clad in black as a sign of mourning . Sadr asked worshipers to pray for his dead relatives , and also for those who had been killed in Sadr City . He again called for the United States to set a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq . He urged a top Sunni sheik to issue three fatwa s : one against the killing of Shiites , another against joining Al Qaeda and the third to rebuild the shrine in Samarra . He compared his father 's followers to those of the Prophet Muhammad . " After the prophet died , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his teachings , and the same has happened with followers of my father . " The " cursed trio "  --  Americans , British and Israelis  --  were trying to divide Iraq . " We Iraqis  --  Sunnis and Shia  --  will always be brothers . " <p> No one in Iraq talks about arresting Sadr for the murder of al-Khoei anymore . That seems like ages ago  --  back when Sadr 's armed supporters were estimated in the hundreds , compared with many thousands today . Now diplomats speak of trying to keep Sadr inside the political system , hoping he can tame his followers . He 's a militant Islamist and anti-occupation , they say , but he 's also a nationalist , and not as close to Iran as some of his rivals . Nobody knows whether Sadr is dissembling when he speaks about Iraqi unity , or preparing for all-out war . What is clear  --  more today than ever before  --  is that it 's time to stop underestimating him . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Days of wrath : A sermon for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11/24 Friday prayer services <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Underestimated no more : Some educated Shiites dismissed the young cleric as a zatut  --  an ignorant child .
