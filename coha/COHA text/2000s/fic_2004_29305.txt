Chapter One LIEUTENANT CHRIS HUNT rarely talked about his past , but the men he served with had gathered a few clues from his demeanor . The first was that Hunt had not grown up in some backwoods hillbilly haven and used the army to see the world . He was from Southern California . And , if pressed , Hunt would volunteer he was raised in the Los Angeles area , not wanting to disclose that he grew up in Beverly Hills . The second thing the men noticed was that Hunt was a natural leader-he was neither patronizing nor put on an air of superiority , but neither did he try to hide the fact that he was competent and smart . The third thing the men found out today . A chill wind was blowing down from the mountains into the Afghanistan valley where the platoon under Hunt 's command was breaking camp . Hunt and three other soldiers were wrestling with a tent they were folding for storage . While the men were bringing the ends together longways , Sergeant Tom Agnes decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the side of the tent so Agnes could fold it into halves . " Sir , " Agnes said , " rumor has it you graduated from Yale University-that true ? " All the men were wearing tinted ski goggles but Agnes was close enough to see Hunt 's eyes . A flicker of surprise , followed by resignation , flashed quickly . Then Hunt smiled . " Ah , " he said quietly , " you 've found out my terrible secret . " Agnes nodded and folded the tent in half . " Not exactly a hotbed for military recruiting . " " George Bush went there , " Hunt said . " He was a navy pilot . " " I thought he was in the National Guard , " Specialist Jesus Herrara , who was taking the tent from Agnes , said . " George Bush Senior , " Hunt said . " Our president also graduated from Yale , and yes , he was a National Guard jet pilot . " " Yale , " Agnes said . " If you do n't mind me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hunt brushed some snow from his gloves . " I volunteered , " he said , " just like you . " Agnes nodded . " Now let 's finish breaking down this camp , " Hunt said , pointing to the mountain nearby , " and head up there and find that bastard who attacked the United States . " " Yes , sir , " the men said in unison . Ten minutes later , with fifty-pound packs on their backs , they started up the mountain . IN A TOWN where beautiful women abound , at age forty-nine Michelle Hunt still caused men to turn their heads . Tall , with hazel hair and bluegreen eyes , she was blessed with a figure that required neither constant dieting nor endless exercise to appear trim . Her lips were full and her teeth straight , but it was her doelike eyes and flawless skin that gave the strongest visual impression . And while she was a beautiful woman , that was as common in Southern California as sunshine and earthquakes . What drew people closer to Michelle was something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , honed through dress or manicure , or developed through ambition or change . Michelle had that thing that made both men and women like her and want to be around her-she was happy , content and positive . Michelle Hunt was herself . And people flocked to her like bees to a flower in bloom . " Sam , " she said to the painter who had just finished the walls in her art gallery , " you do such nice work . " Sam was thirty-eight years old and he blushed . " Only my best for you , Ms. Hunt , " he said . Sam had painted her gallery when it had opened five years before , her Beverly Hills house , her condo in Lake Tahoe and now this remodel . And every time she made him feel appreciated and talented . " You want a bottle of water or a Coke or something ? " she asked . " I 'm okay , thanks . " Just then an assistant called from the front of the gallery that she had a telephone call , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's a lady , " Sam said under his breath , " a lady . " Walking to the front of the gallery , where her desk faced out onto Rodeo Drive , Michelle noticed that one of the artists she represented was coming through the front door . Here her amiability had also paid off in spades-artists are a fickle and temperamental lot , but Michelle 's artists adored her and rarely changed galleries . That and the fact that she had started her business fully funded had contributed greatly to her years of success . " I knew today was going to be good , " she said to the bearded man . " I just did n't know it would be because my favorite artist would be paying me a visit . " The man smiled . " Just let me take this telephone call , " she said , " and we 'll talk . " Her aide corralled the artist toward an area with couches and a wet bar off to one side . As Michelle slid into her desk chair and reached for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order and a few seconds later began packing ground espresso into the machine to draw him a cappuccino . " Michelle Hunt . " " It 's me , " a gravelly voice said . The voice was one that needed no introduction . He had swept her off her feet when she was a young woman of twenty-one , freshly arrived from Minnesota , seeking a new life of fun and sun in 1980s Southern California . After an on-again , off-again relationship , necessitated both by his inability to be bound to a relationship , as well as his frequent absences for business , she had borne his son at age twenty-four . And though his name never appeared on the birth certificate-nor had Michelle and he actually lived together before or since-the pair had remained close . At least as close as the man allowed anyone ever to come . " How are you ? " she asked . " I 've been okay . " " Where are you ? " It was the standard question she asked him to break the ice . Over the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Tahiti . " Hang on , " the man said easily . He stared at a moving map on a forward wall near the cockpit of his jet . " Six hundred and eighty-seven miles from Honolulu on the way to Vancouver , British Columbia . " " Going skiing ? " she asked . The sport was something they had enjoyed together . " Building a skyscraper , " he answered . " You 're always up to something . " " True , " he noted . " Michelle , I called because I heard our boy has been sent to Afghanistan , " he said quietly . Michelle had been unaware-the deployment was still secret and Chris had not been able to disclose his destination when he 'd been dispatched . " Oh my , " she blurted , " that 's not good . " " That 's what I thought you 'd say . " " How 'd you find out ? " Michelle asked . " I 'm always amazed by your ability to ferret out information . " " It 's not magic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many senators and other politicians in my pocket I 've had to buy larger pants . " " Any word on how it 's going ? " " I guess the mission is proving harder than the president envisioned , " he said . " Chris is apparently leading a hunter-killer squad to locate the bad guys . Limited contact so far-but my sources claim it is cold and dirty work . If he does n't contact you for a while , do n't be surprised . " " I 'm afraid for him , " Michelle said slowly . " Do you want me to put in a fix ? " the man asked . " Have him pulled out and sent stateside ? " " I thought he made you agree never to do that . " " He did , " the man admitted . " Then do n't . " " I 'll call you when I know more . " " Are you going to be down this way soon ? " Michelle asked . " I 'll call you if I am , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting to get static on the satellite line . Must be sunspots . " " Pray our boy is safe , " she said . " I might do more than that , " the man said as the call ended . Michelle replaced the receiver in its cradle and sat back . Her ex-beau was not one to show worry or fear . Still , his concern for his son had been palpable and personal . She could only hope his worry was misplaced , and that Chris would come home soon . Rising from the desk , she walked toward the artist . " Tell me you have something good , " she said easily . " Outside in the van , " the artist said , " and I think you 'll like it . " FOUR HOURS AFTER sunrise , one thousand feet higher up the ridge from the camp where they had spent the night , Hunt 's platoon met a determined enemy . The fire came from a series of caves just above and to the east . And it came all at once . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rained down . The enemy dynamited the mountain to create rock slides , pelting the ground below , and they had mined the ground where Hunt 's troops sought refuge . The enemy 's goal was to wipe out Hunt 's team all at once-and they would come close . Hunt had taken refuge behind a series of boulders . Bullets were ricocheting off the rocks to all sides , sending chips flying through the air and striking his men . There was nowhere to hide , no way to advance , and their retreat had been cut off by a rock slide . " Radio , " Hunt shouted . Half his team was twenty yards ahead , another quarter ahead and to the left . Luckily , his radio operator had stayed close to the lieutenant . The man edged toward Hunt on his back to protect the radio . For his effort he received a wound to his kneecap when a bullet grazed his raised knee as the man pushed himself closer . Hunt dragged him the rest of the way . " Antencio , " Hunt shouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of Lassiter 's wound . " Antencio scurried over and began cutting away the radio operator 's pants . He found the opening was not deep and began to wrap a bandage around the knee as Hunt flicked on the radio and adjusted the dial . " You 're going to be okay , Lassiter , " he said to the radio operator . " I 'm going to get us some help in here posthaste . Then we 'll have you medevaced . " The fear in the soldiers ' faces was obvious . For most of them , as for Hunt , this was their first time in battle . As their leader , he needed to take control and form a plan . " Control , Control , Advance Three , " Hunt yelled into the microphone , " need positive support , grid three zero one eight . Taking heavy fire . " " Advance Three , " a voice said immediately , " report situation . " " We 're pinned down , " Hunt said , " and they have the high ground . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking . A dozen bearded men in flowing robes were starting down the hill . " Get some fire up there , men , " he screamed to the forward half of his team . A second later a volley of shots rang out . " Advance Three , we have a Spectre two minutes out and inbound . Four whirlies-two carriers and two gunships-will be off the ground in three . It 'll take them another ten minutes to reach your site . " Hunt could hear the whine of the massive propeller-driven gunship racing up the canyon miles below them . He peeked over the rock to see eight of the enemy still advancing down the hill . Raising himself , he shot off a rocket-propelled grenade . A whoosh then a thump as the charge flew through the air and ignited . He followed up with a volley of automatic weapon fire . " Advance Three , acknowledge . " " Advance Three , affirmative , " Hunt yelled into the microphone . Where there had been eight there were now just four . They were only twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and locked it in place . The forward team seemed paralyzed . They were young , unseasoned and about to be overrun . A mortar landed close to the boulders and exploded . The area was showered with powdered rock and dust . From higher up the mountain another group of the enemy started down the hill . Hunt stood up and started firing . He sprinted the twenty yards ahead to his men and met the advancing enemy head-on . Three 's a charm , and that 's how many Hunt shot dead in the gut . The last one he bayoneted , as his clip was empty . Tasking his sidearm from his holster , he finished the man off , then slid to the ground , replaced his clip and rose and started firing again . " Back it up , men , " he shouted , " behind the boulders . " Two by two his men retreated to the relative safety of the boulders to the rear , while the men remaining kept fire on an advancing enemy . The enemy was high on distilled poppy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were chewing . The slope was red with the blood of their fallen comrades but still they advanced . " Advance Three , " the radio squawked . Antencio reached for the radio . " This is Advance Three , " he said . " Our C.O. is away from the radio , this is Specialist 367 . " " We 've located a B-52 at another target , " the voice said . " We 've diverted her to assist . " " Affirm-I 'll tell the lieutenant . " But Antencio would never have a chance to relay the message . Only Hunt and a grizzled old sergeant were left at the forward site when the AC-130 arrived on station . A second later a wall of lead began pouring from the 25- , 40- and 105-millimeter guns that poked from her sides . The sergeant had seen a Spectre live-fire before and he wasted no time . " Let 's back it up , sir , " he shouted to Hunt , " we have a few seconds of cover . " " Go , go , go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushing him toward safety . " I 'm right behind you . " The Spectre crabbed sideways from the recoil of her firing guns . A few seconds later the pilot pulled her up and out to turn and make another pass through the narrow canyon . As the gunship ended her turn and lined up for her second run , seven of the enemy still advanced . Hunt covered his sergeant 's retreat . He killed five of the enemy with a combination of a rocket-propelled grenade and a concentrated field of fire . But two made it close to Hunt 's position . One shot him in the shoulder as he turned to retreat . The second one slit his throat with a wicked-looking curved knife . Starting down in the dive for the fire run , the pilot of the AC-130 saw Hunt being killed and radioed it to the other aircraft . Hunt 's troops saw it as well-and the sight removed their fear and replaced it with rage . As the AC-130 lined up for the pass , the troops rose and charged another wave that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pushing forward as a team , they reached their fallen leader and erected a protective circle around his body . They waited for the enemy to advance , but as if by magic , or sensing the fury of the American troops , the enemy began to turn and retreat . TWENTY THOUSAND FEET above them and less than ten minutes from the target , the pilot of the B-52 flicked off the microphone and replaced it in its cradle . " Did you all hear that ? " he said quietly on the intercom to his crew . The plane was silent save for the drone from the eight engines . The pilot did n't need an answer-he knew they 'd all heard what he had heard . " We 're going to turn this mountain into dust , " he said . " When the enemy comes for the bodies , I want them to need to collect them with a sponge . " * * * FOUR MINUTES LATER the helicopters came for Advance Three . Continues ...           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
