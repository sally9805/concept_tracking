Singer Tyrese hits the weight room and runs whenever he gets the chance . // FOR most of us , there are not enough hours to get everything done . Work . Home . School . Kids . By the end of the day , you 're looking for the bed , and staying fit becomes the last thing you worry about . But if America 's best minds , men and women who run media empires , medical associations , make our laws and manage chart-climbing singing careers , can find a few minutes a day to do something healthy , so can you . We asked some of your favorite celebrities and politicians what they do to stay in shape despite a very busy work schedule . And their answers ranged from the high-energy to the calm and simplistic . Oprah Winfrey , talk-show host , chairman and CEO of Harpo Inc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After discovering the exercise technique , she dedicated an entire show to yoga , complete with renowned yogi Rodney Lee and a live studio demonstration . Winfrey now loves yoga so much she started a company-sponsored yoga class each week , giving employees the chance to relax , tone up and destress . " When I discover something good , I love sharing it with everybody , " Winfrey says . " And I love yoga so much that I brought it to work . Harpo has a class every week . " For Tyrese , the 22-year-old singer whose sophomore album , 2000 Watts , is climbing the Billboard charts , running is the key , even if it is n't that often . Touring and promoting the new album has cut the singer 's exercise routine from three to five times a week with a trainer to once , maybe twice a week . Still , the former MTV " veejay " known for his rippling abs and topnotch physique says that running gives him a chance to get away and relieve stress . " I just get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When I feel it , I stop . " Running is also an exercising staple of Dr. Rodney Hood , president of the National Medical Association . Dr. Hood , 55 , has a 3.5-mile route that he runs with his wife , Robyn , an interior designer , whenever he 's home in Washington , D.C. But with his busy schedule , running may amount to only one or two days a week . " Well , this year as president , usually every week I 'm traveling , " Dr. Hood says . " I 'm here in my office for the first time in 10 days . Sometimes I 'm not here at all . I 'm usually on the road . " To combat the stress and fatigue of such a hectic schedule , the NMA president meditates twice a day for 15 to 20 minutes . He says he started meditating about 10 years ago , using a combination of breathing and relaxation techniques to keep him more attentive and less agitated during the day . " I think when I go without it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to want to drink more coffee . I get tired easy . It just makes it easier to get through the day . I feel much more at peace , much more attuned with what I 'm doing . " Dr. Hood says his diet also plays an important part in staying healthy amid the ruckus . He eats multiple servings of fruits and vegetables and very little red meat . His inspiration is that of any father 's : his daughter , Ariannah . The 8-yearold became a vegetarian two years ago after Hood hired a vegetarian babysitter . Since then , Ariannah has eaten chicken and fish only on rare occasions . " But she has never gone back and touched any red meat , " Dr. Hood says . " Most of the time , she 'll just eat vegetables . And this is totally on her own . " Photograph Congresswoman Donna M.

Christian  --  Christensen ( delegate-Virgin Islands ) , chairperson of the Congressional Black Caucus ' Health Braintrust , stays in shape by eating healthy and walking every day . On some days , it 's all she has time to do . " In terms of going to a gym , I 'm really not consistent with it , " she says . " But what I do during my workday is make sure I go out of my way to put in extra walking and not scrimping by riding on the capitol 's train between buildings . " And how does one deal with that stressful a life ? Prayer and spirituality . " When things get really crazy , I think turning to God and prayer is what really helps me get through it , " the congresswoman says . " And in thinking about walking , I would say that the best walk I do is the walk into church on Sunday morning .

But she found a new love in weightlifting in order to tone up her physique . " It 's killing me , but I enjoy it , " Price says . " I like the way it makes me feel .

Price will participate in a celebrity charity basketball tournament in July , hosted by fellow singers , N'Sync . " I 'm trying to get myself in shape . I got ta brush up on my skills .
