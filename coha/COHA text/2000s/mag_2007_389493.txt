While her boyfriend waited at home with a ring , Kelsey Smith shopped for a present for him  --  and never returned from her trip to the mall . Maybe her cell phone was n't working , they thought . Maybe she was too busy shopping to pick up . Maybe there was a good explanation for why Kelsey Smith , 18 , did n't answer when her boyfriend , John  --  who was waiting at her parents ' home to give her a promise ring he 'd been carrying around in a little box in his pocket  --  sent her a text message asking " Where are you ? " Maybe , they all thought , hoped  --  maybe . But being out of reach for even a few minutes just was n't Kelsey 's way , and that 's how her loved ones knew something was wrong . It took four days for their worst fears to be realized . On June 6 police in Jackson County , Mo. , found Kelsey 's body in a shallow creek bed in the woods near Longview Lake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the married father of a 4-year-old son , and charged him with kidnapping and strangling Kelsey on June 2 . She had just been shopping at a Target near her home in Overland Park , Kans. ; she bought a pho-to box for John , for all the cards and pictures they had traded in seven months of dating . Hall , who has a history of violence , followed Kelsey into Target , then waited in the parking lot for her to come out . Once she did , say police  --  who are n't revealing what led them to the eventual suspect  --  he pushed her into her 1987 Buick and drove off , returning the car to the parking lot of a Macy 's across from Target about two hours later ( a surveillance video captured the abduction ) . Police also say there is no evidence that Kelsey had previously known Hall , who could face the death penalty if convicted of murder and kidnapping . Hall 's lawyer declined to comment on the case . Like the families of the dozens of children who are kidnapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will now do everything they can to see that she is not reduced to a statistic . What they will do is remember . Remember how Kelsey would eat Skittles only in pairs  --  " and how each pair had to be the same color , " says her father , Greg , 47 , a former police officer who now works in security . Remember the way she organized her nachos , " with every nacho tucked in and facing the same direction , " says her boyfriend , John Biersmith , 18 . Remember how she loved the color blue , so much so that when her friends staged a vigil after her death , they tied blue ribbons around their wrists and released blue balloons into the sky . " Kelsey would have hated it , " says her sister Lindsey , 20 . " She 'd have thought the balloons would end up killing deer . " Everyone who spoke about Kelsey in the days after her death agreed there was something very special about her . " My grandfather was never a baby person , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says her mother , Missey , 41 , a drug-program staffer . Growing up , Kelsey  --  the middle of five children  --  always seemed in charge . She cut everyone 's hair , even her parents ' ' . She painted the nails of her older sisters Lindsey and Stevie , 23 . She mothered her sister Codie , 12 , and brother Zach , 10 . " Actually , " says Missey , " she mothered everyone . " At Shawnee Mission West High School , she sang in the chorus , and one of her dreams was to make a run at American Idol . Yet her confidence had an edge to it , and she could be challenging . She liked to belch loudly to get a rise out of people , and she thought nothing of changing her clothes while driving her friends around . " She loved to embarrass people , " says sister Stevie . " If you were in a fight with her , she 'd suddenly lick your face . " When her mother saw that someone had drawn a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had died , she thought , " That 's not Kelsey ; Kelsey was no angel , " says Missey . " She was headstrong and opinionated . It was never easy raising Kelsey . But it was a tremendous honor raising her . " Above all , Kelsey was conscientious , and she stuck to the big rule laid down by her father : If you 're running late , you call home . She had been out of touch for only an hour on June 2 when her boyfriend and sisters and even her grandparents went looking for her . At 9:30 that night , her grandparents found Kelsey 's car parked outside Macy 's ; her purse and a Target bag were inside . That 's when Greg Smith called the police . Over the next four days , her friends printed flyers , started a " findkelsey " Web site and went door to door . They called themselves Kelsey 's Army . Dozens of volunteers worked day and night . In the end it was her cell phone , pinging with the sound of unanswered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much later Hall was under arrest : Overland Park Police Chief John Douglass would only say the arrest was " the result of thousands of hours of investigation . " Hall , an orphan , was 7 years old when Don and Carol Hall of Emporia , Kans. , took him in . But at 15 , he threatened the Halls ' young daughter with a knife , and they returned him to the custody of the state ( his juvenile record also includes charges that he stole his father 's truck and allegedly hit a boy in the head with a bat ) . " You think you can give them love and all the things they did n't get , " Carol Hall told the Emporia Gazette after Kelsey 's murder . " It works with some , but with him it did n't .
