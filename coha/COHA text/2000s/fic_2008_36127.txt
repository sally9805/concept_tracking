PROLOGUE <p> HELSINKI <p> SEPTEMBER 21 <p> Kirov ! <p> No , it could n't be Kirov , Jennings thought frantically , as he ran down the dock . Kirov was dead . Pavski had given him his word that the stories were all lies . He 'd laughed and said that a ghost could n't kill . <p> And the person behind him was no ghost . It did n't have to be Kirov . Jennings had made a lot of enemies in his life , and any one of them might be the man behind him . <p> But there was no one behind him now . A quick glance behind him revealed an empty dock . His heart slowed as he drew a deep , relieved breath . He 'd lost him . Maybe it had only been a thief . Yes , that was it . It was a lousy section of town , and the man had just targeted his wallet . <p> Not his life . <p> He should n't have panicked . But after he 'd heard about Lantz 's death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be glad to be done with this business . His pace slowed as he approached the pier where the sub was moored . The Silent Thunder lay still and lethal as if crouching , waiting for prey , waiting to take another life . <p> Prey . He tried to suppress the shiver that went through him . He only had to get on the sub and do what Pavski had asked him to do . Nothing was going to happen . It was no more a death ship than Kirov was a ghost . <p> But , God , he did n't want to go on that sub , he thought desperately as he reached the end of the block . He should have never listened to Pavski and stayed undercover . No amount of money was worth this  --  <p> A leather noose slipped around his neck from behind ! <p> Pain . He struggled wildly to turn his head to see the man who had stepped out of the shadows . He only had an impression of height and broad shoulders as he started to black out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck . <p> The sub <p> He could see the Silent Thunder before him , patiently waiting , ready to take him to hell as it had all the others . His vision was fading , and he could see nothing but that monster of a sub . He was going to die , he realized incredulously . No ! He struggled harder . <p> " Stop it . " The order was a soft murmur in his ear . " I do n't want to kill you yet . They say you might still be useful . " <p> Kirov . My God . Damn you , Pavski . Lies . Lies . Lies . <p> Kill the bastard . His hand closed on the knife holstered on his left arm . <p> " Well , actually I do want to kill you now , " Kirov said . " Thank you for giving me the excuse . " <p> He twisted the garrote , jerked backward , and broke his victim 's neck . <p> Excerpted from Silent Thunder by Iris Johansen and Roy Johansen <p> Copyright 2008 by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Martin
