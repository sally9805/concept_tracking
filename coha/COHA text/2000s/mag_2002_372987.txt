He drank heavily for decades and reportedly still likes a whiskey or two , Churchill-like , at age 77 . He takes pain-killers for his knees and has trouble with his bladder , liver and one remaining kidney . He is said to take a three-hour snooze every afternoon . He is given to interminable silences and sudden bursts of poetry , and not infrequently falls asleep in meetings . <P> Atal Behari Vajpayee , then , does not seem like the first choice to control a nuclear arsenal . But for four years , the Indian Prime Minister 's hands have been the grandfatherly restraint holding back the warmongers in his nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party ( B.J.P. ) . <P> Increasingly , Vajpayee 's hands are looking far from safe .

But Vajpayee still insists on an evening libation . And in the family cottage at Manali in the Himalayan foothills , his diet retreats when he does  --  nothing can keep him away from deep fried trout . Says an aide : " He promises to stick to his diet with doubled rigidity once he leaves , but the trout he must have .
