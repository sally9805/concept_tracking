<p> TIMOTHY McVEIGH 'S bombing of the federal office building in Oklahoma City seems as if it happened less than 10 years ago , but its 10th anniversary , which happened a week ago , seems as if it did n't happen at all . And for practical purposes it did n't . Lots of stories made a bigger ripple in the week 's zeitgeist  --  some of them understandably ( new pope chosen ) , some less so ( on " American Idol , " Anwar 's journey ends ) . <p> This attention deficit is partly explained by what took place in Lower Manhattan six years after the bombing . Osama bin Laden 's atrocity dwarfed Timothy McVeigh 's along several dimensions  --  more Americans killed by more killers with a larger political base . Though the McVeigh bombing seems not so long ago , it also seems like part of a simpler era , before we knew real danger . <p> But letting the memory of Mr. McVeigh fade has its own dangers . In a crucially instructive sense he and Mr. bin Laden represent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm guessing they would n't have hit it off ) , both were empowered by a force that will empower tomorrow 's terrorists even more . Unfortunately , it 's a force that the Bush administration has a deep aversion to confronting . And there 's no better illustration of this aversion than one of the many people who got more press last week than Timothy McVeigh : John R. Bolton , Mr. Bush 's choice for ambassador to the United Nations . <p> The force I 'm darkly alluding to is technology , and , to be sure , it 's been much discussed since 9/11 . Productively , even . Lots of people now see how stubbornly the threat from weapons of mass destruction grows . Progress in biotechnology , for example , will put more bioweapon tools and ingredients within reach of more people at pharmaceutical companies , universities , and so on . There 's also more appreciation of how advances in information technology help terrorist groups hatch plans and orchestrate them , and even help these groups form and grow in the first place . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how ecumenically they abet terrorists , we 'd keep Mr. McVeigh 's image not just alive but right next to Mr. bin Laden 's . And we 'd see the tolls the two men took  --  more than 150 in 1995 , nearly 3,000 in 2001  --  as the first two entries in an ominous sequence . Timothy McVeigh may seem primitive ( a bomb made of fertilizer ? ) , but he 's primitive in the classic sense of the word : he represents an early phase in a natural growth . <p> Even in the spring of 1995 , microelectronics was helping extremist groups coalesce and harden . They circulated videotapes like " Waco : The Big Lie , " a McVeigh favorite . It was incendiary and dishonest , like an Al Qaeda recruiting video , just not distributed online . After Mr. McVeigh accomplished his mission , the far right used shortwave radio to tell the faithful that the American government had done the deed in order to discredit their cause . ( Sound familiar ? ) <p> Similarly , Mr. McVeigh 's fertilizer bomb may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials we fear Al Qaeda has , but it falls into their lineage once you reduce all three to their basic source : growing ingenuity in the concoction of lethal force ; wider availability of the ingredients in an ever-more-industrialized , interconnected world ; and growing access , via information technology , to the knowledge needed to use them . <p> Of course , Osama-era technologies are more menacing than McVeigh-era technologies . That 's the point . What today 's Internet is to shortwave radio and mailed videotapes , tomorrow 's Internet will be to today 's . As streaming video penetrates the most remote parts of the world , every Web-cam-equipped terro-vangelist will have global reach . And information technologies , like the advancing weapons technologies whose use they make more likely , are equal-opportunity empowerers : radical Islam , radical environmentalism , neo-Nazism , whatever . <p> Yet America 's war on terror defines the threat more narrowly : out there in the " Muslim world " or the " Arab world , " things need to change . <p> And of course they do . But that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that in 15 years , " Muslim rage " has evaporated . If we have n't addressed the generically growing part of the terrorist threat  --  the technology and its consequences  --  we still wo n't be secure . Whether the next unprecedented trauma comes from right or left , from abroad or at home , 9/11 will fade to sepia , as Oklahoma City did after 9/11 . <p> Not everything about America 's antiterrorism policy is Muslim-centric . The administration 's homeland security policy pays attention to nuclear power plants and biotech labs . But leaving aside whether it does so adequately ( short answer : no ) , you ca n't secure the homeland by focusing only on the homeland . As President Bush has stressed , we have to worry about weapons of mass destruction abroad , given how hard it is to detect every vial of germs , or even every suitcase nuke , that enters America . Yet his most salient approach to the problem  --  invade a country if we suspect it has such weapons  --  is too costly ( in various senses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an option , there is ultimately no alternative to international arms control . It will have to be arms control of a creatively astringent , even visionary , sort . And achieving it will be a long haul  --  incremental , halting progress , over many years , through a series of flawed but improving agreements that are at first less than global in scope . But for now the details do n't matter , because the Bush administration opposes the basic idea . <p> Why ? Because John Bolton is not just the undersecretary for arms control , but the guiding spirit , so far , of the administration 's arms control philosophy . To get other nations to endure intrusive monitoring , America would have to submit to such monitoring . People of Mr. Bolton 's ideological persuasion insist that this amounts to a sacrifice of American sovereignty . And they 're right ; it 's just a less objectionable sacrifice of sovereignty than letting terrorists blow up your cities . <p> Weeks before 9/11 , the Bush administration antagonized much of the civilized world by rejecting an arduously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have put teeth in the treaty , making member nations , which forswear the possession of bioweapons , open their soil to inspectors . <p> Would 9/11 and the ensuing anthrax attacks soften the administration 's opposition ? Or  --  since the protocol was no doubt imperfect  --  might the administration at least suggest an alternative international inspections regime ? Two months after 9/11 , Mr. Bolton told a gathering of member states that the answers were no and no . ( Who needs inspections ? Mr. Bolton told the assemblage that the existence of Iraq 's bioweapons program was " beyond dispute . " ) <p> Mr. Bolton 's signature arms-control achievement is the " proliferation security initiative , " which encourages the interdiction of ships suspected of carrying illicit munitions . Mr. Bolton says there have been interdictions under the pact . What he does n't say is that they could have happened without the pact , because it grants no new powers of interdiction . Any such powers would have to apply not just to foreign merchant ships but to ships sailing under an American flag  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of American sovereignty . <p> If the world 20 years from now is to be safe from the technology of 20 years from now , we 'll have to address not just the supply of illicit weapons but the demand for them . The upshot of the technological trends that empowered Timothy McVeigh and Osama bin Laden is that over time hatred will morph into lethality with growing efficiency . Dampening hatred is a disconcertingly vague challenge , but there are things we can do at home and abroad . <p> At home , this is an argument for civil discourse , since you never know when there 's an excitable boy , a potential Timothy McVeigh , tuned in . Abroad , it 's an argument for exercising power with grace . Sometimes you have to antagonize the world to do the right thing , but more than ever we should avoid antagonizing the world gratuitously . Why is the prospect of John Bolton representing America at the United Nations again springing to mind ? <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com
