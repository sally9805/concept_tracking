Personal Statement Blanche , white night of my dark day . My sister , my self . Blanche : a cry building behind sealed lips , then blowing through . First the pout , then the plosive ; the meow of the vowel ; then the fricative sound of silence . Shhhh . Blanche is sleeping . She has been sleeping for fifteen years . I can tell you the exact moment I knew she was waking up . But allow me a day 's grace . Let me remember that last afternoon , unimportant in itself , wonderfully unimportant , when I was still Nora , just Nora , Nora Olney , Nora alone . The flags lining Market Street from Church to Castro flexed and snapped , showing sometimes one , sometimes two linked rings . The stop signs shuddered on their spines . The wind had picked up in the late afternoon , as usual , and now the whole sky seemed to be toppling sideways over the Twin Peaks , carrying with it whorls of smoke from the incinerators and pure white spooks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the tickets I 'd gone there for , joggling two oranges in a plastic bag and going over my excuses . Blanche was sleeping . Of course she was . I dropped into the gutter to skirt some crowd-control fences ganged in readiness against a streetlight , and our heads collided . A distant , confused echo of her pain overtook and lost itself in mine , but her breathing stayed steady and deep . I was threading my way along the curb . The sidewalk was already thronged with out-of-towners , already dressed for Pride in brand-new T-shirts with rubbery silk-screened slogans , " One 's Company " and " 22 " and " YESIAMESE . " They were strolling in twos and threes and fours of varying molecular structure , exchanging glances of appraisal and nervous pleasure . The singletons anxious to understand , to be seen understanding . The twofers beaming , indecently grateful for one weekend of sanctioned self-satisfaction . Tomorrow they 'd all be here : Siamese and Siamystics , conjoined and joiners , doppelgangers and gruesome twosomes , double-talkers , double-dealers , twice-told tale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks of curiosity and sympathy , like the birthday child in a leukemia ward . The twin amplifiers flanking the temporary stage back at Eighteenth Street retched , rid themselves of five beats of that ubiquitous " We-R-2-R-1-4-Ever , " went dead . No we 're not , I thought , reflexively . I pulled one hood of my hoodie farther over Blanche , but her blond hair spilled out , catching a rogue ray of sun , and the tourists gave each other quick digs with their elbows . It 's Sleeping Beauty ! As for the hag with the two-faced apple in her pocket , everyone knows how the story goes . Sooner or later she 'll have to turn the other cheek . " Repent , " advised the wizened lady in the plastic visor who protested every day at Market and Sixteenth . Today her hand-lettered sign read " GO BACK TO SIAM . " " Oh , I do , " I said , fervently , hand on hearts . She slit her eyes at me , suspicious . Let me be clear , while I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to call a Siamese twin , though I prefer " conjoined , " with its faint echo of the alchemists ' conjunctio and those copulatives copulating in grammar books . I 'm the one on the left , your right . Blanche is on my right , your left . I  --  oh , say it : we  --  have strong cheekbones , long earlobes , hazel eyes , and dirty-blond hair , which is also usually dirty blond hair . Glamour is not very important to me , and it seems goofy to groom Blanche , like trimming my pubes into a heart . But I 'm not really a hag . I am stern , though , and wear the marks of habitual sternness , while Blanche is smooth as soap . I never used to need a mirror to see what I looked like , I just turned my head . But we have grown apart , Blanche in her beauty sleep and I. Dicephalus dipus dibrachius . That 's two heads , two legs , and two arms : standard-issue twofer . Aside from that pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much different from yours . Novelties include the short third collarbone we share between us ; a spinal column that begins to divide in two around the sixth thoracic vertebra , flaring the upper chest ; two windpipes , two and a half lungs , and a deuce of hearts . Audrey says vampires also have two hearts , one good , one bad . While the good heart beats , the vampire is as capable of kindness as any human soul , but when the good heart stops , the beat of the bad heart strengthens in the dying breast , and makes a decent woman rise from her coffin to prey on everyone she once loved best . The blood of kinfolk wets her chin . If this is true of twofers too , I know which heart is mine . I cut around the flower stall at the corner , vaulting a white bucket in which a single sunflower was privately flaunting itself , filling the whole bucket with a secret glow . My shadow eclipsed it for the duration of a blink . Blanche 's head jerked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there to steady it . In the lee of the stall , I suddenly felt the lingering warmth of the June day . My temples prickled . The smell of smoke and roses rose around me . The light strengthened , the streetcar tracks shone like new scars , and I thought of the young woman recently killed by a streetcar on Church  --  " Decapitated , " Trey had reported with relish , though you could n't believe everything he said  --  and let go of Blanche 's neck . " Nora ! " Across the street , a duplex figure in a festival T-shirt waved a fluttering pink flyer . Cindi and Mindi ? I could not remember their names , but I had a feeling they rhymed . Twofer names so often do . Jane and Elaine , then , or Mitzi and Fritzi , were passing out flyers with both hands next to a leaning cutout of RubiaMorena , this year 's Pride queen . Knowing it was futile , I kept my face lowered as I crossed , as if trying to read something in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible as a Rorschach blot . Continues ...
