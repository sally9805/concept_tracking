Mike May ? s life was near perfect when , on February 11 , 1999 , he made his way to the dais in the ballroom of San Francisco ? s St. Francis Hotel . // The forty-six-year-old businessman had been invited to present the prestigious Kay Gallagher Award for mentoring the blind , an award he ? d won himself the previous year . Dozens in the audience knew his history : blinded at age three by a freak accident ; three-time Paralympics gold medalist and current world record holder in downhill speed skiing ; entrepreneur on the verge of bringing a portable global positioning system ( GPS ) to the blind ; coinventor of the world ? s first laser turntable ; mud hut dweller in Ghana ; husband to a beautiful blond wife ( in attendance and dressed in a tight black top , short black skirt , and black high heels ) ; loving father ; former CIA man . // People watched the way May moved . He walked with a quiet dignity , effortlessly negotiating the obstacle course of banquet tables and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the way . There was more than mobility in his step ; his gait seemed free of regret , his body language devoid of longing . Most of the people in this room worked with the blind every day , so they knew what it looked like for a person to yearn for vision . May looked like he was exactly who he wanted to be . // He was accustomed to public speaking , and his messages were always inspiring . But every so often a member of the audience would turn on him , and it usually came at the same part of his talk , the part when he said , " Life with vision is great . But life without vision is great , too . " At that point someone would stand and jab his finger and say , " That ? s impossible ! " or " You ? re not dealing with your inner demons , " or " You ? re in denial . " The objections came from both the blind and the sighted . May was always polite , always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warm but definite way in which he ? d spoken since childhood , he would say , " I don ? t mean to speak for anyone else . But for me , life is great . " // That , however , would not be the message for this evening . Instead , the tall and handsome May spoke glowingly about the award winner , about how much it had meant to him to win the Gallagher , and about the importance of mentoring . He seasoned his talk with jokes , some tried and true , others off the cuff , all to good effect . Then he presented the honoree with a plaque and a check and returned to his seat . When he sat down , his wife , Jennifer , told him , " You made me cry . You look beautiful in that suit . And that was a lovely talk . " // May and Jennifer stayed at the hotel that night . Ordinarily , they would have awoken and made the seventy-five-mile drive to their home in Davis , California , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact lenses had been bothering her , so she had scheduled an appointment with a San Francisco optometrist  --  not her regular eye doctor , but a college friend ? s husband who had been willing to see her on short notice . Though May was itching to get back to his home office , he agreed to accompany Jennifer to the appointment . The morning was glorious as the couple strolled San Francisco and enjoyed that rarest of pleasures , an unhurried weekday breakfast at a streetside caf ? . // The optometrist ? s office was nearby , so May and Jennifer , along with May ? s Seeing Eye dog , a golden retriever named Josh , walked up Post Street to make it to the morning appointment . Jennifer assured him that the visit would take no more than thirty minutes . May had never accompanied his wife to an eye appointment and was pleasantly surprised to learn that they would be out so quickly . // The waiting room grabbed Jennifer ? s attention straightaway . An interior designer , she lived in a world of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May : the direction the chairs faced , the narrowing of the hallway that led to the exam rooms , the taupe of the wall behind the receptionist  --  " whose cheekbones are stunning , by the way . " It intrigued May that he had married a woman whose universe was so dominated by the visual , and it delighted him that she felt so passionate about sharing it all with him , even about the beautiful women . // A few minutes later Mike Carson , the optometrist , greeted May and Jennifer and led them to an office . Carson examined Jennifer , recorded some measurements , and told her he would write her a new contact lens prescription . May was glad that things had gone so quickly  --  this would allow him to get home in time to pick up their sons from school . // Carson finished making his notes and flipped on the light . He looked at May for a few seconds , made another note in Jennifer ? s file , then looked back at May . He asked how long it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // " At least ten years , " May replied . // " How about if I take a look ? " Carson asked . " That ? s a long time to go without seeing a doctor . " // " You want to examine me ? " May asked . // " Just for a second , " said Carson . " Let ? s just make sure everything is healthy in there as long as you ? re here . " // May thought about it for a moment , then said , " Sure , why not ? " // May and Jennifer switched places so that May now was in the examining chair , the one with the chin holder and instrument that looks like the pay-per-view binoculars on top of the Empire State Building . // " I think you ? re going to find that I ? m blind , " May joked . // The doctor leaned in and immediately saw that May had a blue-colored prosthetic left eye . His right eye , his natural eye , was nearly opaque and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or color could be seen at all . Some blind people wear dark glasses to conceal such an eye , but May had never felt the need to do so . His eyelid drooped a bit , leaving his eye mostly closed , so no one reacted badly to it . // Carson stepped away and sat on a stool . // " Mike , " he said , " I wonder if you ? d mind if my partner , Dr. Dan Goodman , takes a look at you . He ? s an ophthalmologist , one of the best in the country . I think he ? d be interested . " // May glanced toward Jennifer with just the slightest quizzical look . Jennifer was already wearing the same expression . // " I guess it can ? t hurt , " May said . // Carson left the room . For a moment neither May nor Jennifer said anything . Then each said to the other , " That ? s interesting . " // A moment later Carson returned with his partner . Dr. Goodman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? d lost his vision . // " It was a chemical explosion when I was three , " May replied . // " Do you have an ophthalmologist ? " Goodman asked . // " He died about ten years ago . He ? d been my doctor since the accident , " said May . // " What did he tell you about your vision ? " Goodman asked . // " He tried three or four corneal transplants when I was a kid , " May said . " They all failed . After that , he told me that I would never see , I ? d be blind forever . He was supposed to be a great ophthalmologist . I knew he was right . " // " Who was he ? " Goodman asked . // " Dr. Max Fine , " May replied . // Goodman ? s eyes lit up . // " Dr. Fine was a legend , " Goodman said . " He was my teacher . I sought him out when I was young and asked to do surgery with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great ophthalmologists in the world . " // May and Goodman spent a minute reminiscing about Dr. Fine . Then Goodman asked , " Mind if I take a look ? " // " Not at all , " May replied . // Goodman dimmed the lights , stepped forward , and , using the thumb and forefinger on one hand , opened the lid of May ? s right eye . The stillness of the touch startled May . Goodman ? s hand stayed absolutely motionless , absent the vaguest hint of tremor . May had felt that kind of touch only once before , from Dr. Fine , who had held his eye open in just the same way . // Goodman peered into May ? s eye . He saw the massive corneal scarring that trademarks a chemical explosion . He shone a penlight into May ? s eye , which May could barely detect ( most blind people have some vague light perception ) . But when Goodman waved his hand in front of the eye May could not perceive the movement . Goodman conducted a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had used . It took only moments for him to see that May was totally blind . // The exam lasted perhaps five minutes . Goodman turned on the lights and pulled up his stool . // " Mike , " Goodman said . " I think we can make you see . " // The words barely registered with May . // " There is a very new and very rare stem cell transplant procedure , " Goodman continued . " It ? s indicated for very few types of cases . But a chemical burn like yours is one of them . " // Jennifer leaned forward . She wasn ? t sure whether to look at Goodman or her husband . What was Goodman saying ? // " Despite your horrible corneal disease , it looks like there ? s good potential for vision in your eye , and that it can benefit from a stem cell transplant , " Goodman said . " I ? ve done maybe six of these procedures . Most ophthalmologists in the world haven ? t done any . It ? s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t know of anyone who has done one on a patient who has been blind for as long as you ? ve been . But it could work . " // All May could think to say was " That ? s interesting . " // " If you ? re interested you need to come back for something called a B- scan , " Goodman explained . " That ? s an ultrasound designed to look into the back of the eye to make sure there ? s no gross pathology or abnormality . But if the B-scan is clean , there ? s a good chance this could work . " // Goodman ? s words sounded surreal to May . His body and brain agreed simultaneously that it was impossible , that once Goodman ran the tests he would see what Dr. Fine had seen  --  a patient beyond repair . Still , the newness of the science intrigued May  --  he ? d never before heard the term " stem cell " used in connection with vision  --  and he fashioned this thought : " I ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time . Why can ? t vision technology change , too ? " // " Is it complicated ? " May asked . // " The stem cell transplant is complicated , " Goodman said . " By itself it provides no visual benefit . But it sets the stage for a cornea transplant three or four months later . If all goes right , the two surgeries add up to vision . " // May appreciated that Goodman spoke clinically and directly , and without trying to inspire him . To Jennifer , something seemed amiss . Vision had always been impossible for May , not because science hadn ? t caught up to him but because something fundamental was missing or unfixable. // Jennifer watched May for his reaction . There was no hallelujah . There were no cries of " Oh , my God ! " Rather , May pursed his lips slightly and gazed up and to the right a bit , the way he always looked when he was considering the theoretical rather than the wonderful . // " I ? d like to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May said . // " Of course , " Goodman said . " Take your time . Call my office if you ? d like to go ahead with the B-scan . It was very nice to meet you . " // Goodman shook hands with May and Jennifer . And with that he was out of the room . The encounter had lasted less than ten minutes . // After the appointment May and Jennifer were walking back to their red Dodge Caravan , which was still parked near the St. Francis Hotel . The weather was bright and brisk , and reminded Jennifer of the couple ? s newlywed days living in San Francisco , when they walked miles for just the right Chinese takeout and talked about their future on the way . // " Do you and Wyndham have soccer practice tonight ? " Jennifer asked , unlocking the Caravan ? s doors . // " Not tonight , " May said . " Good thing , too . I ? m already behind on a bunch of business calls . It ? s amazing  --  just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from under your feet . " // Josh climbed in and sat on the floor of the passenger side , between May ? s feet . Jennifer found her sunglasses , started the ignition , and pulled out onto Post Street . With good traffic they would be in Davis in an hour and a half . May opened his cell phone and began to return business calls , simultaneously making certain that Jennifer didn ? t miss the turnoff to Route 80 . Though May could not see , he possessed a collection of uncannily accurate mental maps  --  it was that kind of skill , and others , that caused many to consider him a kind of super- blind man . // Once across the Bay Bridge , the couple relaxed a bit . For a few miles neither said anything . Then Jennifer looked over at May and remarked , " Well , that was fascinating . " // " It sure was , " May said . " It doesn ? t sound real , does it ? " // Jennifer hesitated for a moment . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the implications of Goodman ? s offer , but she knew this much : something big had happened , and whatever it meant it was certain to be an intensely personal issue for her husband . For that reason she wanted to say nothing , to simply let him process it for himself . But she also needed to hear him talk . // " So , hypothetically , " Jennifer finally said , " and we don ? t know if this would even work , but just for fun , what would it be like ? What might you like to see ? " // In twelve years of marriage they had never discussed what it might be like for May to see , not even in the playful way in which they allocated imaginary lottery winnings . Since early childhood , May himself had not thought about what it might be like to see , a fact that struck many who met him as inconceivable . The concept of vision simply was not part of his existence . Just the sound of Jennifer ? s question felt otherworldly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it very clear that I would never see in my lifetime , so it ? s probably not possible , " May said . " But just for fun . . . " // Jennifer kept her eyes on the road . // " I think I ? d like to see panoramas , especially at Kirkwood , " May said , referring to the family ? s favorite ski resort . " And I ? d like to see beautiful women . " // " That makes sense , " Jennifer said . " You ? re always thinking about those things anyway . " // " Panoramas and women are two things I love but can ? t go around touching . They can ? t really be adequately described to me . Those are two things you really have to touch with your eyes in order to fully appreciate . " // " Where might you go to see these beautiful women  --  other than your own home , of course ? " she asked . // " Saint-Tropez . Straight to the topless beaches . " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mind if I go with you ? " // " If you don ? t mind me gawking. " // " You ? ve been gawking since I met you . What else ? " // May thought further . He told Jennifer he might like to see the Eiffel Tower or the Statue of Liberty or the Gal ? pagos Islands , all places to which he ? d already traveled . Definitely the Golden Gate Bridge . //
