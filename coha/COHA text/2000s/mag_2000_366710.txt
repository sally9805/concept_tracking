WHAT DRIVES BUSH <P> After I read how George W. Bush won the South Carolina primary CAMPAIGN 2000 , Feb. 28 , it was clear that John McCain 's ads comparing Bush to Clinton were right on target . Rather than continuing to whine , Bush should do a bit of soul searching with Jerry Falwell or Pat Robertson . Taking the Clinton " I 'll do anything to win " road to Washington is nothing to be proud of . The only thing Bush will bring to Washington is hot air from a different party . SHARON FLECK HERMAN Lindenhurst , Ill . <P> Bush is a man who gets results , speaks from the heart and believes passionately that his policies are the best way to keep this country great . McCain is an egotistical hypocrite who will turn himself into anyone to get power . Bush is the man who will do the most for my children , and he 'll get my vote . DARCY LINN San Francisco <P> The Republican establishment is looking for a certain image in its presidential candidate , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is happening or does n't care . Whichever it is , do we really want a man who is oblivious to reality in the White House ? PAUL ROWLAND DeKalb , Ill . <P> If Bush becomes president , I just hope he does n't start spending our tax dollars the same way he 's been going through his campaign money . Tax money is the people 's money . As a conservative Republican , Bush should show that he is a responsible spender . MARC PERKEL Springfield , Mo . <P> Anyone who wants to return to party bosses in back rooms ( smoke filled or otherwise ) selecting the nominee should vote for Bush . This campaign is mostly about control . Pick the candidates , flood ' em with squashing amounts of money and send ' em forth . Round up the cadre to provide a flying wedge . Anyone not on board had better consider himself dead meat as far as the party is concerned . George W. Bush is merely the cover boy in this campaign ; the Republican Party bosses are the real candidates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that is driving Bush 's campaign , it needs an overhaul . SAUL KAHAN Los Angeles <P> Powerful interests are protecting their $70 million investment with a candidate they consider a winner because of little more than his name-recognition value . We are headed for business as usual and a choice between two bought-and-paid-for candidates . DONNA S. TRAVERS Santa Monica , Calif . <P> CHINA BATTLES THE NET <P> Karl Marx said religion was " the opium of the people , " but the real opium is ignorance . By trying to choke the spread of the Internet in China WORLD , Feb. 28 , the Communist Party is stopping the spread of knowledge . Despite their attempts , communist leaders will find that China 's Iron Curtain will eventually break down under the forces of freedom .
