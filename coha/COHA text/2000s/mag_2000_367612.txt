If memory serves , I saw the original , Richard Roundtree version of Shaft in Jackson , Miss. , with a group of college students who had volunteered for Charles Evers ' quixotic campaign to become the first black Governor of the most racist state in the nation . Even by the standards of blaxploitation flicks it was n't a great movie , but back in 1971 it seemed just right for the tumultuous times . The original Shaft was n't merely " the private dick who 's a sex machine to all the chicks " or " the man who wo n't cop out when there 's danger all about . " Like Evers , he was a tough guy caught up in the movement for black freedom , a cocky straight shooter with equal disdain for bad cops and for dope-pushing mobsters  --  in short , the kind of hero who would have pursued the new Samuel L. Jackson incarnation of Shaft and nailed him for police brutality . <P> If only the Rev. Al Sharpton were a movie critic ! If only Johnnie Cochran could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hollywood did not have such an exploitative view of the young black urban audience this gratuitously violent and graceless remake of Shaft is meant to attract ! The problem is not just that Jackson , normally as good an actor as they come , is to Roundtree what George Lazenby , who played James Bond in the deservedly forgotten On Her Majesty 's Secret Service ( 1969 ) , is to Sean Connery . It 's that instead of updating the heroic Shaft of the ' 70s to fit the ambiguous racial climate of the new century , the makers of this disgraceful film have pulled the character inside out and transformed him into a thug . If this Shaft were a real-life member of New York City 's Finest , he would n't be tracking bad guys . He 'd be the overaggressive cop who stops , frisks  --  and beats up  --  people just because they look suspicious . This new film invites young black moviegoers to applaud the kind of police abuse they protest against in the streets . <P> Unlike the original , the new , ersatz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaking the nose of a handcuffed prisoner in full view of the police commander . He relishes the line " It 's Giuliani time ! " as he prepares for the film 's final showdown  --  a reprise of a cruel reference to New York City 's hard-line mayor that was famously and falsely attributed to the cop who tortured Abner Louima . If that is n't enough , contrast this Shaft 's vulgar behavior toward a black woman in the film 's only romantic sequence with the original Shaft 's tender , though hardly exclusive relationship with his girlfriend . The new Shaft is neither a heroic knight errant nor a sex machine ; he 's just another ego-tripping homicidal misogynist . <P> Which , of course , is standard fare for the cookie-cutter action movies Hollywood cranks out by the dozen . But I had hoped that a director as noted as John Singleton and an actor with Jackson 's talent would produce something more challenging than a cinematic gangsta-rap song . The original Shaft  --  one of the first black movie heroes to talk back to the Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blacks like me who came of age during the ' 70s . We could use another hero like that now . Instead we got the shaft .
