Chapter One DEREK STRANGE GOT down in a three-point stance . He breathed evenly , as his father had instructed him to do , and took in the pleasant smell of April . Magnolias , dogwoods , and cherry trees were in bloom around the city . The scent of their flowers , and the heavy fragrance of a nearby lilac bush growing against a residential fence , filled the air . " You keep your back straight , " said Derek , " like you 're gon na set a dinner up on it . You ai n't want your butt up in the air , either . That way you 're ready . You just blow right out , like , and hit the holes . Bust on through . " Derek and his Saturday companion , Billy Georgelakos , were in an alley that ran behind the Three-Star Diner on a single-number block of Kennedy Street , at the eastern edge of Northwest D.C. Both were twelve years old . " Like your man , " said Billy , sitting on a milk crate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his meaty hand . " Yeah , " said Derek . " Here go Jim Brown right here . " Derek came up out of his stance and exploded forward , one palm hovering above the other , both close to his chest . He took an imaginary handoff as he ran a few steps , then cut , slowed down , turned , and walked back toward Billy . Derek had a way of moving . It was confident but not cocky , shoulders squared , with a slight looseness to the hips . He had copied the walk from his older brother , Dennis . Derek was the right height for his age , but like all boys and most men , he wished to be taller . Lately , at night when he was in bed , he thought he could feel himself growing . The mirror over his mother 's dresser told him he was filling out in the upper body , too . Billy , despite his wide shoulders and unusually broad chest , was not an athlete . He kept up on the local sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pinball machines , cap pistols , and comic books . " That how Brown got his twelve yards in eleven carries against the ' Skins ? " said Billy . " Uh-uh , Billy , do n't be talkin ' about that . " " Don Bosseler gained more in that game than Brown did . " " In that game . Most of the time , Bosseler ai n't fit to carry my man 's cleats . Two weeks before that , at Griffith ? Jim Brown ran for one hundred and fifty-two . The man set the all-time rushing record in that one , Billy . Don Bosseler ? Shoot . " " Awright , " said Billy , a smile forming on his wide face . " Your man can play . " Derek knew Billy was messing with him , but he could n't help getting agitated just the same . Not that Derek was n't a Redskins fan . He listened to every game on the radio . He read the Shirley Povich and Bob Addie columns in the Post whenever they saw print . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chuck Drazenovich , halfback Eddie Sutton , and others . He even tracked Bosseler 's yards-per-carry . In fact , he only rooted against the ' Skins twice a year , and then with a pang of guilt , when they played Cleveland . Derek had a newspaper photo of Brown taped to the wall of the bedroom he shared with his brother . With the exception of his father , there was no one who was more of a hero to him than Brown . This was a strong individual who commanded respect , not just from his own but from people of all colors . The man could play . " Don Bosseler , " said Derek , chuckling . He put one big , long-fingered hand to the top of his head , shaved nearly to the scalp , and rubbed it . It was something his brother , Dennis , did in conversation when he was cracking on his friends . Derek had picked up the gesture , like his walk , from Dennis . " I 'm kiddin ' you , Derek . " Billy got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on the diner 's back stoop . " C'm on , let 's go . " " Where ? " " My neighborhood . Maybe there 's a game up at Fort Stevens . " " Okay , " said Derek . Billy 's streets were a couple of miles from the diner and several miles from Derek 's home . Most of the kids up there were white . But Derek did n't object . Truth was , it excited him some to be off his turf . On most Saturdays , Derek and Billy spent their time out in the city while their fathers worked at the diner . They were boys and were expected to go out and find adventure and even mild forms of trouble . There was violence in certain sections of the District , but it was committed by adults and usually among criminals and mostly at night . Generally , the young went untouched . Out on the main drag , Derek noticed that the local movie house , the Kennedy , was still running Buchanan Rides Alone , with Randolph Scott . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father had promised to take him down to U Street for the new John Wayne , Rio Bravo , which had people talking around town . The picture was playing down at the Republic . Like the other District theaters on U , the Lincoln and the Booker T , the Republic was mostly for colored , and Derek felt comfortable there . His father , Darius Strange , loved westerns , and Derek Strange had come to love them , too . Derek and Billy walked east on the commercial strip . They passed two boys Derek knew from church , and one of them said , " What you hangin ' with that white boy for ? " and Derek said , " What business is that of yours ? " He made just enough eye contact for the boy to know he was serious , and all of them went on their way . Billy was Derek 's first and only white playmate . The working relationship between their fathers had caused their hookup . Otherwise they never would have been put together , since most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colored boys and white boys did n't mix . Was n't anything wrong with mixing , exactly , but it just seemed more natural to be with your own kind . Hanging with Billy sometimes put Derek in a bad position ; you 'd get challenged out here when your own saw you walking with a white . But Derek figured you had to stand by someone unless he gave you cause not to , and he felt he had to say something when conflict arrived . It would n't have been right to let it pass . Sure , Billy often said the wrong things , and sometimes those things hurt , but it was because he did n't know any better . He was ignorant , but his ignorance was never deliberate . They walked northwest through Manor Park , across the green of Fort Slocum , and soon were up on Georgia Avenue , which many thought of as Main Street , D.C. It was the longest road in the District and had always been the primary northern thoroughfare into Washington , going back to when it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lined the strip , and folks moved about the sidewalks day and night . The Avenue was always alive . The road was white concrete and etched with streetcar tracks . Wood platforms , where riders had once waited to board streetcars , were still up in spots , but the D.C. Transit buses were now the main form of public transportation . A few steel troughs , used to water the horses that had pulled the carts of the junkmen and fruit and vegetable vendors , remained on the Avenue , but in short order all of it would be going the way of those mobile merchants . It was said that the street would soon be paved in asphalt and the tracks , platforms , and troughs would disappear . Billy 's neighborhood , Brightwood , was mostly white , working- and middle-class , and heavily ethnic : Greeks , Italians , Irish Catholics , and all varieties of Jew . The families had moved from Petworth , 7th Street , Columbia Heights , the H Street corridor in Northeast , and Chinatown , working their way north as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following World War II . They were seeking nicer housing , yards for their children , and driveways for their cars . Also , they were moving away from the colored , whose numbers and visibility had rapidly increased citywide in the wake of reurbanization and forced desegregation . But even this would be a temporary move . Blockbuster real estate agents in Brightwood had begun moving colored families into white streets with the intention of scaring residents into selling their houses on the cheap . The next stop for upper-Northwest , east-of-the-park whites would be the suburbs of Maryland . No one knew that the events of the next nine years would hasten that final move , though there was a feeling that some sort of change was coming and that it would have to come , an unspoken sense of the inevitable . Still , some denied it as strongly as they denied death . Derek lived in Park View , south of Petworth , now mostly colored and some working-class whites . He attended Backus Junior High and would go on to Roosevelt High School . Billy went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which had some coloreds , most of whom were athletes . Many Coolidge kids would go on to college ; far fewer from Roosevelt would . Roosevelt had gangs ; Coolidge had fraternities . Derek and Billy lived a few short miles apart , but the differences in their lives and prospects were striking . They walked the east side of Georgia 's 6200 block , passing the open door of the Arrow cleaners , a business that had been in place since 1929 , owned and operated by Bill Caludis . They stopped in to say hey to Caludis 's son , Billy , whom Billy Georgelakos knew from church . On the corner sat Clark 's Men 's Shop , near Marinoff-Pritt and Katz , the Jewish market , where several of the butchers had camp numbers tattooed on their forearms . Nearby was the Sheridan Theater , which was running Decision at Sundown , another Randolph Scott . Derek had seen it with his dad . They crossed to the other side of Georgia . They walked by Vince 's Agnes Flower Shop , where Billy paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Margie , and the Sheridan Waffle Shop , also known as John 's Lunch , a diner owned by John Deoudes . Then it was a watering hole called Sue 's 6210 , a Chinese laundry , a barbershop , and on the corner another beer garden , the 6200 . " Stagger Lee " was playing on the house juke , its rhythms coming through the 6200 's open door . On the sidewalk outside the bar , three young white teenagers were alternately talking , smoking cigarettes , and running combs through their hair . One of them was ribbing another , asking if his girlfriend had given him his shiner and swollen face . " Nah , " said the kid with the black eye , " I got jumped by a buncha niggers down at Griffith Stadium , " adding that he was going to be looking for them and " some get-back . " The group quieted as Derek and Billy passed . There were no words spoken , no hard stares , and no trouble . Derek looking at the weak , all-mouth boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " about it , only had to be one . At the corner of Georgia and Rittenhouse , Billy pointed excitedly at a man wearing a brimmed hat , crossing the street and heading east . With him was a young woman whose face they could n't see but whose backside moved in a pleasing way . " That 's Bo Diddley , " said Billy . " Thought he lived over on Rhode Island Avenue . " " That 's what everyone says . But we all been seein ' him around here lately . They say he 's got a spot down there on Rittenhouse . " " Bo Diddley 's a gunslinger , " said Derek , a warmth rising in his thighs as he checked out the fill of the woman 's skirt . They walked south to Quackenbos and cut across the lot of the Nativity School , a Catholic convent that housed a nice gymnasium . The nuns there were forever chasing Billy and his friends from the gym . Beyond the lot was Fort Stevens , where Confederate forces had been repelled by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fort had been re-created and preserved , but few tourists now visited the site . The grounds mainly served as a playing field for the neighborhood boys . " Ai n't nobody up here , " said Derek , looking across the weedy field , the American flag flying on a white mast throwing a wavy shadow on the lawn . " I 'm gon na pick some porichia for my mom , " said Billy . " Say what ? " Derek and Billy went up a steep grade to its crest , where several cannons sat spaced in a row . The grade dropped to a deep gully that ran along the northern line of the fort . Beside one of the cannons grew patches of spindly plants with hard stems . Billy pulled a few of the plants and shook the dirt off the roots . " Thought your mama liked them dandelion weeds . " " That 's rodichia . These here are good , too . You got ta get ' em before they flower , though , ' cause then they 're too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get something to drink . " Billy lived in a slate-roofed , copper-guttered brick colonial on the 1300 block of Somerset , a few blocks west of the park . In contrast with the row houses of Park View and Petworth , the houses here were detached , with flat , well-tended front lawns . The streets were heavy with Italians and Greeks . The Deoudes family lived on Somerset , as did the Vondas family , and up on Underwood lived a wiry kid named Bobby Boukas , whose parents owned a flower shop . All were members of Billy 's church , St. Sophia . On Tuckerman stood the house where midget actor Johnny Puleo , who had played in the Lancaster-Curtis circus picture , Trapeze , stayed for much of the year . Puleo drove a customized Dodge with wood blocks fitted to the gas and brake pedals . On the way to the Georgelakos house , Derek stopped to pet a muscular tan boxer who was usually chained outside the front of the Deoudes residence . The dog 's name was Greco . Greco sometimes walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was known to be quick , loyal , and tough . Derek got down on his haunches and let Greco smell his hand . The dog pushed his muzzle into Derek 's fingers , and Derek patted his belly and rubbed behind his ears . " Crazy , " said Billy . " What you mean ? " " Usually he rises up and shows his teeth . " " To colored boys , right ? " " Well , yeah . " " He likes me . " Derek 's eyes softened as he admired the dog . " One day , I 'm a get me one just like him , too .
