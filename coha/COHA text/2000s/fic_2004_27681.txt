Chapter One The cramps woke Morgan at 3:30 a.m. , startling her out of a deep slumber . She 'd been immersed in a dream about a little girl on a swing set , her long brown hair flowing on the breeze . She knew without a doubt that the child was the baby she was carrying . The cramps offered a stark warning , as if her anxiety had shaped into a blunt instrument that bludgeoned her hope . She sat up , her hand pressed over her flat stomach , and looked at Jonathan , who slept peacefully next to her . Should she wake him to tell him she was cramping , or just be still and wait for it to pass ? She had taken the home pregnancy test yesterday morning , then followed up with a blood test at her doctor 's office that afternoon . Jonathan sat in the examining room with her , fidgeting and chattering to pass the time . When the nurse came back with the verdict , he sprang to his feet , muscles all tense , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you the results , I need to know if I 'm bearing good or bad news . " Jonathan glanced at Morgan , and she knew he was way too close to calling the woman a smart aleck and warning her not to toy with them . " Come on , just tell us . " " But do you want to be pregnant ? Is good news a yes or a no ? " Before he could grab the nurse by the shoulders and shake the playfulness out of her , Morgan blurted out , " Yes ! More than anything ! " " Are we going to have a baby or not ? " Jonathan asked . " Congratulations ! " The word burst out of the nurse 's mouth , and Morgan came off the table , flinging herself into his arms , and they yelled like kids as he swung her around . They agreed not to announce it until today , so they could share that first night of giddy excitement , crushing the secret between them . They waited until Caleb , their eighteen-month-old foster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street to Hanover House 's private stretch of beach . They giggled and danced under the May moonlight , to the music of the waves whooshing and frothing against the shore . When they 'd finally gone to bed , they lay awake until close to midnight , wondering if it would be a girl or a boy , and how soon they would be able to see their child on a sonogram . Jonathan held Morgan and whispered about soccer games and ballet , piano lessons and PTA . Finally , they had both fallen asleep , and now she did n't want to wake him . It was probably nothing . Just something she ate last night . She would have to be more careful now . But as the moments dragged on the cramping grew worse , and she could n't ignore it . She folded her arms across her stomach and slid her feet out of bed . She sat up and realized it was worse , even , than she thought . There was blood . " Oh , no . " The words came out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at her in the night . " Baby , what is it ? " She turned on the lamp . " Oh , Jonathan ... " He looked at her with an innocent , terrible dread , expecting something , though not clear what . Slowly , he sat up . " What ? " A sob rose in her throat as she pointed to the mattress . For a moment they both just stared at it , the blood-spot of a dream dying . Their unformed , barely real , secret baby dying . Then he jolted out of his stunned stupor and sprang out of bed . " Are you okay ? " " I 'm losing it . " The words bubbled up in her throat . " Jonathan , I 'm losing the baby ! " " We 're going to the hospital . Maybe it 's not what you think . Maybe they can stop it . " He pulled on the jeans hanging over a chair by the bed . Maybe he was right . Maybe the baby was still there , nestled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose in her . Or if not , maybe the medical staff could ward off danger , stop the impending doom , give her some magic pill to make it hang on . She quickly got dressed while Jonathan woke Sadie-their seventeen-year-old foster daughter and Caleb 's sister-to tell her of the emergency and ask her to listen for her little brother in case they were n't back when he awoke . Then Jonathan helped Morgan out to the car as though she were a sick woman who could n't walk on her own . She tried not to make sudden moves , not to walk too hard , not to cramp so tightly . But it all seemed out of her control . " It 's okay , baby , " Jonathan said as he drove at breakneck speed across the island . " We 'll be in Savannah in no time . " Was it already too late ? The drive from Cape Refuge to the closest hospital was too far . She cried quietly , staring out the windshield , praying that God would intervene . " God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he drove . " He has to . " Morgan 's face twisted . " Her ... you said her . " She looked over at him and saw the tears on his face . " You think it 's a girl ? " He did n't answer . " God , please ... " She sobbed as he drove , her hand pressed against her stomach . What kind of mother am I ? I could n't keep it safe for a day ? Her tears were cold against her face in the breeze of the airconditioner . Jonathan 's lips moved in some silent monologue-a desperate preacher 's prayer of faith and hope-or the angry railing of a seaman who saw terror coming and believed he could head it off with enough threats . His hands clutched the steering wheel , and occasionally he reached over to touch her with fearful reassurance . Finally , they reached St. Joseph 's , and Jonathan pulled up to the emergency room door . He got out and ran to Morgan 's side , helped her out . There was blood all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had soaked into the seat . " I need help here ! " Jonathan helped her through the sliding glass door . " Please , someone help ! " But Morgan knew there was no help for her baby . It was already too late . Chapter Two Two hours later , they rode home in silence , each mired in their own despair . As she 'd known he would , the doctor confirmed her fears . She had miscarried her child . Guilt and anguish ached through her body . How would Jonathan ever forgive her ? They both wept quietly as the sun rose over the Atlantic , heralding a day that others would find beautiful and welcome . But she would do anything to turn the clock back to this time yesterday .
