Single Green Frog seeks his princess . Do you believe in fairy tales ? One kiss and it 's happily ever after . No smokers , please . PETA members preferred . <p> WE MET NEAR A POND , OF course . " I loved your ad , " I said after we 'd finished our introductions . Sharon , meet Jerry . Frog , meet human . " But I have to admit I was n't expecting an actual amphibian . " My companion shrugged what would have been his shoulders , if only he 'd had some . The result was a rippling quiver of the skin just behind his sleek green head . Jerry was an attractive frog , really . Striking . he had iridescent green skin dappled with bronze , and a splendid crimson vocal sac below his broad froggy smile . Behind each golden eye was a perfectly round black spot , which I took to be purely decorative until a hazy memory surfaced from junior high . We 'd dissected frogs in eighth grade biology . Tympanums , I thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a genuine PETA member either , " Jerry said . " That was just a bit of frog humor . " He did n't croak . His voice was a smooth and pleasant baritone , surprisingly low for a creature the size of my fist , and his diction was perfect . The red vocal sac swelled to impressive proportions as he spoke . I looked down at the Starbucks cups between us on the picnic table . I 'd brought two vanilla lattes to our rendezvous , gambling that my date would be a coffee drinker . He was n't . " I 'm not a member anymore , " I confessed , " ! stopped contributing after they asked the town of Hamburg , Pennsylvania , to change its name to Veggieburg . " " You 're joking . " " No , it 's true . Years back they asked a town called Fishkill to change its name to Fishsave , but that did n't get as much publicity . " I shut up and sipped my coffee , embarrassed by my own babbling . It strikes me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own species . Glib to gibbering in two seconds flat . After a moment 's awkward silence I forced myself to meet ferry 's shining eyes again . They were bulging , but kind . He smiled . I smiled back . " So how did it happen ? If you do n't mind me asking . " He waved a forefoot in a dismissive gesture . His front feet had four toes each , while the heavily webbed hind feet had five . " I find it unnatural if someone does n't . It suggests either an excess of politeness or an appalling lack of curiosity , would n't you say ? " He hopped a few lengths away from me along the tabletop , pausing to stare out across the water . Following his gaze , I noticed the lily pads for the first time : a flotilla of round emerald leaves , a scattered few captained by luminous white flowers . I wondered how they looked through Jerry 's jewel-like eyes . A promised land ? A prison ? " I was married , once upon a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like a child I closed my eyes to listen . " To a rich man 's daughter . When we met she had everything and I had nothing , and that attracted us both madly . We were polar opposites . " " Like magnets , " I murmured . " Magnets in love ? " he sounded amused . " But you know what happens to magnets when the polarity of one is reversed . " In place of attraction , repulsion . Yes , I knew . " She loved me . I do believe that . But she 'd never lacked for anything in her life , and she wanted all the luxuries she was accustomed to - things I could n't afford to give her on a middle manager 's salary . So she 'd take them as gifts from her father , against my wishes , or run up our credit cards impossibly high , and then we 'd argue . Bitter fights half the night sometimes . We did n't leave any marks , but we did n't take any prisoners either . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less of a man . And with every shiny , expensive thing she wanted that I could n't give her , I felt her drawing farther away . At the end she would physically recoil from me in bed at night , as though she 'd touched something horrible and slimy . " I opened my eyes . " She left you because you became a frog ? " " Oh no , " he said with surprise . " I became a frog because she left me . " Now there 's a self-esteem problem , I thought . But it happens to us all , does n't it ? Whether you 're a beauty or a beast , when someone you love rejects you , your mirror turns mean . You stand in front of it crying , " Mirror , mirror , what 's wrong with me ? Why was n't I good enough for him to love ? " And the damn mirror shows you . Suddenly every line and flaw is magnified , - suddenly every year shows . Those extra ten pounds , that too-prominent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boobs too small - the cold glass reflects it all . Jerry probably started out as a nice presentable guy with eyes that bulged just a little , before his wife and his self-confidence disappeared through the looking glass . " But at least you 're getting out there now , " I said finally , in what I hoped Jerry would consider an encouraging tone . To my own ears it sounded appallingly like my mother 's voice , trying to cheer me up after my disastrous senior prom . " Dating . Trying to get back to normal . " Jerry 's green head bobbed in a nod . " Trying , yes , " he said . " But not succeeding very well so far . It 's difficult enough for normal , attractive people to find love these days , Sharon , never mind a guy who 's ... well , not exactly Prince Charming . " I snorted . " Nobody is Prince Charming , Jerry . Prince Charming does n't exist , and ugly stepsisters need love too . Are you sure you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go ahead and have it . Caffeine makes me jumpy . " He winked one golden eye . Laughing , I toasted him with the Starbucks cup . " You do n't know what you 're missing . I 've got to have my coffee every day or I 'm absolutely Grimm . " Jerry groaned - and that did come out as a croak , a silly wavering croak that broke in the middle like a pubescent boy 's . We both succumbed to a fit of the giggles then , human laughter mingling with bursts of frog song . The first shared laugh with someone new is always a shining moment , an instant of connection that warms you inside even if you 're not wildly attracted to your date . Sometimes I get from a first date to a second on laughs alone . That 's not such a bad thing , either ; it beats the hell out of getting there on desperation . I 've done that too , I 'm sorry to say . " That 's better ! " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerry . That 's why your ad caught my eye : it was funny and optimistic . " He hopped closer and looked up intently into my eyes . His pupils were n't vertical or horizontal like most frogs " eyes , they were round like a person 's . It gave him a wide-eyed , earnest look . " Is that what made you answer it ? " " I suppose so . It certainly was n't because I believe in fairy tales . " A rueful smile turned up the corners of my mouth . " Not the ones with happy endings , anyway . But I was impressed that a guy who described himself as a " frog " still had the confidence to hope for a happily-ever-after . It sounded a little naive , maybe , but sweet . And I figured a sweet guy who did n't consider himself a handsome prince might overlook me not being much of a princess . " Jerry 's vocal sac swelled and deflated , swelled and deflated . I took this to be the froggy equivalent of being at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerry , " I said . " I know I 'm no beauty . " It was the truth . When I work at it , as I 'd worked at it that day , I clean up well . I 'm tall and slender ; my hair is a glossy natural auburn ; I 've been told I have a lovely smile . But no amount of expensive tailoring or makeup can disguise the fact that my shoulders are too broad , my cheekbones too flat , my jaw square , my nose long . I 'm a handsome woman when I try , but it would take more than plastic surgery to make me a beautiful one . Jerry 's eyes distended ; he looked alarmed . " Sharon , do n't say that . For pity 's sake , I 'm a frog - you ca n't believe I 'm sitting here making judgments about your appearance ! I 'm grateful , so deeply grateful , that you 're still here speaking with me at all . You 're - you 're the most beautiful woman I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jerry . " The red balloon of his vocal sac emptied in a sigh . " All right , I confess you 're also the only one . But believe me when I tell you that you look lovely to me . Certainly much more attractive than I must look to you . " I felt my cheeks grow pink . " Uh , well , you 're very - " " Sharon . " It was my turn to sigh . " Okay . As a frog you 're drop-dead gorgeous , hon , but as a guy you just are n't my type . " I ached for him as the words registered . His whole body seemed to shrink with disappointment . He looked so small and miserable , so crushed . The strange thing about not fitting the world 's narrow definition of beauty is that you never quite accept it inside . No matter how squarely you face facts in front of your own bathroom mirror , no matter how hard you struggle to make peace with yourself and live happily inside your own skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflected in another person 's eyes . Why ? God only knows . It 's just how we 're made . We ca n't tickle ourselves , and we ca n't deal our own egos a mortal blow . Not like another person can . At least we can pleasure ourselves . There 'd be a lot more suicides in lonely apartments if we could n't . " I 'm sorry , Jerry , " I said softly . Leaning closer to him , I was stricken to see his eyes welling up with tears . " Oh , Jerry ! Do n't - please , it 's not worth it , please do n't - " His mouth opened , but not to speak : to sing . Not in laughter this time , but in pain . The sound was larger than Jerry , larger than both of us . Its mournfulness echoed across the park , its longing rippled across the water . My ears were filled with it . My bones ached with it . Each note reverberated with all the misery his small green body had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lipless mouth in a wordless , universal song of sorrow . Wordless , yet it spoke . I am a stranger alone in a strange land , his song said to me . I am a beautiful creature trapped behind other eyes . I love but am not allowed to love , I long for all I can not have , I lust with loins that never cool , I Love ! I love ! I love ! It was his song , but it could have been mine . By the time he sang the final notes , tears were streaming down my face . When the final echoes faded , I picked Jerry up in trembling hands and brought his mouth to mine . Hands still shaking , I set him gently down again . He was unchanged . I put my head down on the picnic table and sobbed as though my heart were breaking . It was . " Sharon . " Jerry 's cool , moist head nudged my bare arm . " Shhh , Sharon , it 's all right . Please do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My name is n't Sharon , it 's Stephen . " " Oh . " There was a moment 's silence . " Stephen , then . Please do n't cry , Stephen . You did a marvelous thing for me . " I raised my head reluctantly . I knew I had to be a mess with my nose all red and runny , eyes swollen , foundation streaked . More than that , I felt exhausted emotionally and physically , aching from my head to my size eleven Prada pumps . " You 're still a frog , Jerry , " I said miserably . " I did n't do a thing except hurt you . I 'm so sorry . " But Jerry did n't look hurt . His golden eyes were alight with a new glow , and when he spoke his voice was jubilant . " You kissed me ! Even though I 'm a slimy amphibian , Sharon - Stephen - you kissed me ! " I sniffed and dabbed at my face with a Starbucks napkin . " So what ? Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slept with you too , for all the good it would do . You 're still a frog , Jerry . I 'm not your princess . I 'm nobody 's princess . I 'm just a freak in women 's clothing , dreaming of the day he gets his willy lopped off . " Jerry winced a little at that , but not as much as a man would have . Frogs do n't have penises . " If you 're a freak , " he said gently , " then what am I ? Stephen , you gave me the first ray of hope I 've had in seven months . You kissed me . You were n't the right one to transform me - you said it yourself , I 'm not your type - but you did kiss me . That means it 's not hopeless after all . I 'm not so repulsive that no one will ever touch me again . " Do n't you understand ? I 've been terrified that even if I did meet the right woman , my princess , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run from me , you kissed me ! " I shook my head in disbelief . " Jerry , I 'm glad I made your day . But if your idea of a successful relationship is your date not running away screaming - " I stopped as my own words registered . " Hmm . Come to think of it , that 's my idea of a good date too . " For the second time that afternoon we laughed together , but I was still weighed down with the sorrow of his song . My head was aching , and my Wonderbra was digging sharply into my chest in a way that felt anything but wonderful . All I wanted was to go home , put on pajamas , and drown my sorrows in a pint of Cherry Garcia . I gathered up the Starbucks litter and took it to a nearby trash barrel , then returned to the picnic table to make my farewells to Jerry . He was still beaming from tympanum to tympanum . " It 's been a pleasure , Sharon . " I picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to call me Sharon anymore . But thank you . " " You are Sharon , " he replied , " and you are beautiful . I 'll never forget you . " I smiled wryly . " I have to say you 're going to stick in my mind for a while too , hon. Thank you for a very ... memorable date . " I bent down and gave him one more for the road , right on top of his dappled green head . " You take care now . I hope you find your princess . " " And you your prince , sweet Sharon . " Still haunted by his beautiful , terrible song , I was all the way home and halfway naked before I discovered why my padded bra had suddenly gotten so uncomfortable . Mirror , mirror , on the wall . I had breasts .
