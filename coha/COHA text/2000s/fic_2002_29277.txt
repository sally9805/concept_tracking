She was wearing a straw hat , pulled down over her forehead , a short flowered dress , no stockings and white high heels . A lot of blond hair showed under the hat . Her face was nearly angelic and looked about 15 , though the fact that she wore a wedding ring made me skeptical . She marched into my office like someone volunteering for active duty , and sat in one of my client chairs with her feet flat on the floor and her knees together . Nice knees . " You 're Mr. Spenser . " " I am . " " Lieutenant Samuelson of the Los Angeles Police Department said I should talk to you . " " He 's right , " I said . " You know about this already ? " " No , " I said . " I just think everybody should talk to me . " " Oh , yes . . . My name is Mary Lou Buckman . " " How do you do Mrs. Buckman . " " Fine , thank you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't quite sure what she should do next . I did n't know either , so I sat and waited . Her bare legs were tan . Not tan as if she 'd slathered them with oil and baked in the sun-tan as if she 'd spent time outdoors in shorts . Her eyes were as big as Susan 's , and bright blue . Finally she said , " I would like to hire you . " " Okay . " " Do n't you want to know more than that ? " " I wanted to start on a positive note , " I said . " I do n't know if you 're serious or if you 're laughing at me , " she said . " I 'm not always sure myself , " I said . " What would you like me to do ? " She took a deep breath . " I live in a small town in the foothills of the Saw Tooth Mountains , called Potshot . Once it was a rendezvous for mountain men , now it 's a western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with money , who 've moved there with the idea of getting their lives back into a more fundamental rhythm . " " Back out of all this now too much for us , " I said . " That 's a poem or something , " she said . " Frost , " I said . She nodded . " My husband and I came from Los Angeles . He was a football coach , Fairfax High . We got sick of the life and moved out here , there actually . We run , ran , a little tourist service , take people on horseback into the mountains and back-nothing fancy , day trips , maybe a picnic lunch . " " ' We ran a service ' ? " I said . " I still run it . My husband is dead . " She said it as calmly as if I 'd asked his name . No effect . I nodded . " There was always an element to the town , " she said . " I suppose you could call it a criminal element-they tended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the Dell . There 's an old mine there that somebody started once , and they never found anything and abandoned it , along with the mine buildings . They are , I suppose , sort of contemporary mountain men , people who made a living from the mountains . You know , fur trapping , hunting , scavenging . I think there are people still looking for gold , or silver , or whatever they think is in there-I do n't know anything about mining . Some people have been laid off from the lumber companies , or the strip mines , there 's a few left over hippies , and a general assortment of panhandlers and drunks and potheads . " " Which probably interferes with the natural rhythm of it all , " I said . " They were no more bothersome than any fringe people in any place , " she said , " until about three years ago . " " What happened three years ago ? " " They got organized , " she said . " They became a gang . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his real name . He calls himself The Preacher . " " Is he a preacher ? " " I do n't know . I think so . I do n't think he 's being ironic . " " And there 's a problem , " I said . " The gang lives off the town . They require the businessmen to pay protection . They use the stores and the restaurants and bars and do n't pay . They acquire businesses in town for less than they 're worth by driving out the owners . They bully the men . Bother the women . " " Cops ? " " We have a police chief . He 's a pleasant man . Very likable . But he does nothing . I do n't know if he 's been bribed , or if he 's afraid or both . " " Sheriff 's Department ? " " The sheriff 's deputies come out , if they 're called . " she said . " But it 's a long way and when they arrive , there are never any witnesses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " She shifted in her chair , and pulled the hem of her skirt down as if she could cover her knees , which she could n't . She did n't seem to be wearing any perfume , but she generated a small scent of expensive soap . " They killed my husband . " " I 'm sorry , " I said . " He was in the Marine Corps . He played football in college , " she said . " He was a very courageous man . An entirely wonderful man . " Her voice was flat and without inflection , as if she were reciting something she 'd memorized . " He would n't pay the Dell any money , " she said . " So they killed him . " " Witnesses ? " " No one has come forward . " " How do you know it was the , ah , Dell ? " I said . " They threatened him , if he did n't pay . Who else would it be ? " " And you want me to find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they go to jail . " " Can you pay ? " " Yes . Up to a point . " " We 'll come in under the point , " I said . She shifted in her chair again and crossed her legs , and rested her folded hands on her thigh . " Why did n't you just sell and get out ? " I said . " Move to Park City or someplace ? " " There 's no market for homes anymore . No one wants to move there because of the Dell gang . " " And you knew Samuelson from your L.A. days . " " His son played for Steve . . . my husband . " " And you asked him about getting some help and he suggested me . " " Yes . He said you were good and you 'd keep your word . " " A good description , " I said . " He also said you were too sure of yourself . And not as funny as you thought you were . " " Well he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But no need to argue . " " Will you do it ? " Okay , " I said . " Just like that ? " " Yep . " " What are you going to do ? " " Come out and poke around . " " That 's all ? " " It 's a start , " I said .
