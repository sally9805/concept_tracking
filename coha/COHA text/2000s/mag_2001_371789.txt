It was one of those moments when you forget all the trash for which television has been responsible , and give thanks for a technology that pumps words and images into a billion living rooms . By now the world knows what Osama bin Laden looks like , and most of its inhabitants , perhaps , decided long ago what they thought of him . But with a quick nod to those who remain convinced that the whole performance was a fake , there 's no substitute for the real thing . The videotape shown last week of bin Laden , his colleagues and a visitor from Saudi Arabia discussing , with evident pleasure , the attacks of Sept. 11 provided a peek into the world of terrorism of a kind that can be matched by no other form of reporting . <P> Everyone saw the same tape , but each saw it in a different way . Experts on terrorism scrutinized the video for what it might tell them about the structure , methods and support of al-Qaeda . For most viewers in the Western world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dreams , the thanks and praise to Allah , whose name was repeated about as often as a teenager says " cool " in a typical conversation . In the Islamic world , by contrast , the central mystery of the tape had little to do with its content and more with the process by which it had been made public . Why had the Americans produced it now ? And so the tape became the perfect example of a wider truth : technologies like television may have shrunk the world , but they have not given it a common understanding . <P> Speaking the day after the tape was broadcast , President George W. Bush said he had wrestled with whether to release it at all . Bush first saw the tape toward the end of November and discussed its message with Karen Hughes , his counselor . The President was nervous about its effect on the families of victims , some of whom , when they heard of its existence , argued that it should be kept under wraps . But Bush said he thought the tape amounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all but the most blinkered of viewers , it does . Bin Laden boasts of a detailed prior knowledge of the Sept. 11 attacks . Talking in a relaxed fashion with a Saudi visitor whose identity was a matter of some debate , he discusses the team that pulled off the hijacks , the moment he was told of the day the attacks would take place , and his estimates of the likely effects of the crashed planes on the World Trade Center . For Bush , this self-incrimination was worth the renewed pain it might cause those who lost loved ones . So more than two weeks after the tape was discovered , it found its audience .
