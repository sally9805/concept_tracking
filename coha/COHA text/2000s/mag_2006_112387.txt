St. Louis ( 23 ) 5.30 29 +14 7 1.04 22 58 // Rarely have the best teams in each league been more obvious heading into the postseason than they are this week -- and not in a half century have both those favorites been from New York . Whether or not Bud Selig , Fox TV executives , fans in the Heartland and John Rocker want to hear it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick pastrami on rye : pure New York and difficult for an out-of-towner to stomach . ? At week 's end the Mets and the Yankees were at the top their leagues in wins ; first in the NL and second in the AL , respectively , in run differential ; and -- this does not go unnoticed in a year in which a new revenue-sharing system is being negotiated -- had their leagues ' largest payrolls . Says one National League general manager of the teams ' financial advantages , " It 's fantasy baseball . It 's a joke . " // In 2000 , when the Yankees and the Mets met in the first Subway Series since the Bronx Bombers beat the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1956 , the upstart , wild-card Mets bowed in five games . The rest of the country largely ignored the Series ; TV ratings fell 22.5% from the Yankees-Braves Fall Classic of the previous season . Only the Giants-Angels series in ' 02 and the White Sox ' sweep of the Astros last year have drawn smaller audiences . // These Mets , though , have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investments in free agents over the last several winters ( pitchers Tom Glavine , Pedro Martinez and Billy Wagner , and centerfielder Carlos Beltran ) , they blew unchallenged through a weak league . " I do n't think any team other than the Mets can knock off the Yankees , " the NL G.M. says . " I know it 's baseball and anything can happen , but put it this way : It 's New York 's World Series to lose . " // Says an AL G.M. , " The Mets should come out of the NL , but that league is playing for the right to lose the World Series . I do n't see enough dominant starting pitching out there for anybody to shut down the Yankees . " // With an unrelenting combination of patience and power on offense , the Yankees are so deep that manager Joe Torre will not pinch-hit for any of his nine regulars . That puts his lineup in a class with that of Cincinnati 's 1976 Big Red Machine , which swept the Yankees in the World Series without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' 53 Dodgers , who lost the Fall Classic in six to the Yankees without replacing any of its eight position players for offensive purposes . // Who has frontline , experienced pitching to thwart the Yankees ? The staffs of their likely AL obstacles -- the Tigers , Twins and A's -- are 4 -- 7 combined in playoff starts , with A 's lefty Barry Zito accounting for three of those wins . Moreover , the closers for those clubs have a total of one save and 5 2/3 postseason innings . " If we play our game , I 'll take our chances , " Yankees G.M. Brian Cashman says . " We have a very talented and a very motivated team that 's a lot more balanced than the last few we 've taken into the postseason . We run the bases better , play better defense and find more ways to score . " // Similarly , the Mets figure to dominate their half of the bracket . Their most glaring flaw is a vulnerability to lefthanders . But if Philadelphia does n't seize the wild card , the Mets would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 43-year-old David Wells of the Padres. // For all that , fans west of the Hudson River should n't tune out yet . The three-round postseason format , which debuted in 1995 , introduces so much unpredictability that half of the last 12 World Series teams did n't even win their own divisions . And of the last six Series champions , three did not finish in the top third of their league in run differential . Dismayed at the idea of a Subway Series ? Here are some limbs you might go out on . // Mariano Rivera 's right forearm The Yankees ' lineup is at once arguably the most menacing in baseball history and overrated -- at least when it comes to October baseball . In the book Baseball Between the Numbers , Baseball Prospectus studied every playoff team from 1972 through 2005 and concluded , " There is literally no relationship between regular-season offense and postseason success . " It found that the three most important postseason factors are a team 's ability to strike out batters , its defense and its closer ( chart , left ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs matters more than the accumulation of runs . The Yankees ' chances , therefore , hinge less on their lineup than on the health of their closer , Rivera , who missed most of September with forearm soreness . Torre loves to deploy him in the eighth inning during the postseason , but he ca n't do that if Rivera has n't fully recovered . // Johan Santana 's left arm The Twins ' ace is the best starting pitcher in the postseason , and he 'll go twice in a five-game , first-round series . Santana can shut down any offense , leaving the less imposing trio of Carlos Silva , Boof Bonser and Matt Garza to win one of the other three games . Silva and Bonser , however , have pitched well in September , and with their hard-throwing , shutdown bullpen , the Twins rate as a better postseason pick than the Yankees when the Baseball Prospectus formula is applied . // While not as dominant as Santana , Zito would have to play a similar role for Oakland , though he has struggled against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With his high strikeout rate and low batting average against , Rich Harden , Oakland 's ace when healthy , is an intriguing possibility as a shutdown starter . But after missing three months with right-elbow trouble , Harden 's sharpness and durability are in question . // Pedro Martinez 's right calf Like Harden , the Mets ' No. 1 starter will have only three tune-up outings after incurring a strained right calf . But with their deep , ground-ball-crazy bullpen and productive offense , the Mets do n't need Martinez to be dominant . " All we need is six good innings or so , " G.M. Omar Minaya says . Still , Martinez , who restored credibility to the franchise when he signed after the 2004 season , is an emotional touchstone for the team . New York 's vincibility increases if he gets cuffed around because he ca n't push off the rubber or finish his pitches . // The Phillies ' left arms At first glance the Phils , who led the NL in runs through Sunday but were 12th in runs allowed , appear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baseball Prospectus , 20 teams made the playoffs from 1972 through 2005 with below-average run prevention . Sixteen of those 20 teams lost in the first round , and only two reached the World Series ( the 1982 Brewers and the ' 93 Phillies , both of whom lost ) . But that profile is somewhat misleading : Lefthanders Cole Hamels , Jamie Moyer and Randy Wolf made only nine starts in a Philadelphia uniform before the All-Star break . Hamels and Moyer have pitched better than the league average in most key categories since the middle of August , when the Phillies took off . Then there 's righty Brett Myers , who 's the kind of flamethrower capable of running a postseason table the way Josh Beckett did for the ' 03 Florida Marlins. // Which brings us to the power of the timely hot streak . The 2002 Angels hit a scorching .320 in the postseason . The 2004 Red Sox , after being down to their last licks , ran off eight wins in a row . The 2005 White Sox , who nearly squandered a 15-game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 -- 1 tear in October . // That 's why even the Phillies , who were 16 1/2 games out of first place with a barely .500 record on Sept. 2 , could strut around last Friday night with nearly as much confidence as the fat-cat Yankees and Mets . After hitting his 58th home run and slipping into a Deacon Jones NFL throwback jersey , first baseman Ryan Howard declared , " We 're more relaxed than ever . We 're having fun out there . " // Added shortstop Jimmy Rollins , " I keep quoting Jay-Z : ' I will not lose . ' " // It 's that time of year when anything seems possible -- even if nothing 's more likely than a New York --  New York World Series . // The Secret Sauce // A BASEBALL PROSPECTUS analysis of every playoff series since 1972 revealed three factors -- what BP calls the " secret sauce "  - -  that most reliably predict postseason success . The sauce 's ingredients are 1 ) a staff 's strikeout rate , or Equivalent K/9 ( EqK9 ) , which adjusts for a team 's league @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fielding Runs above Average ( FRAA ) , an estimate of the runs a team 's fielders have saved or cost their pitchers relative to the league average ; and 3 ) strength of closer , or Win Expectation above Replacement ( WXRL ) , which measures the wins a team 's closer has saved against what a replacement-level alternative would 've done . These indicators pointed to the matchup between the Astros and the White Sox in last year 's World Series , as well as to the unlikely titles of the 1990 Reds and 2002 Angels . Here are the secret-sauce rankings of the nine contenders at week 's end , with their overall place among the 30 MLB teams in parentheses .
