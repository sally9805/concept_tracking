Chapter One Part I The Early Years 1864-1881 When I was little , I loved playing in the mud and shaping tiny people out of it . I made a mama , a papa , a little girl , and a little boy that looked just like Paul , curly hair and all . One day it suddenly began to pour torrents , the way it always rains in Villeneuve , and all my little people began to melt . I stood there watching as they grew smaller and smaller and finally flowed away in the flood . It made me cry so hard I could n't stop , and I was glad when Maman pulled me away from the mud , even if she did send me to bed without any supper . As I lay in bed and seethed , I determined to make new little people the first thing in the morning . It had felt so good I wanted to do it always . Before anyone one else was up I crept into the back yard . It was spring . The rain had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Villeneuve lingered in the air . I discovered that the thick red dirt was harder than it had been yesterday and had changed color . Now some whitish streaks showed through it . I knelt by the mud hole I 'd made the day before and grasped fistfuls ofdirt in both hands . It felt chalky and stuck together . I rolled it between my hands until it became a solid ball , and joyfully clutched it against my woolen jumper , forgetting what Maman would say about dirtying my clothes . I held the ball up to my nose and sniffed its fragrance all the way down to my tummy , and held my breath as long as I could . The rich red earth smelled so flesh I wanted to lick it , but I did n't because I was afraid of what Maman would do if she found out . Then I dug into my mud ball with a frenzy and began to mold the little figures again , I pressed here and there , now indenting it to form the eyes and mouth , now building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with my fingernails or a flat stick I 'd saved from the fireplace . Suddenly I saw that the figure I called Maman had large , sad eyes . It amazed me that she looked stern and duty-bound , just like she really does . I , Camille Rosalie Claudel , had made a real little person , all by myself ! I could n't get over how true to life she looked . First there was nothing but mud , and then there was a real little person . If there is a God , I ' 11 bet he felt like that when he made Adam . But I was n't as satisfied with the Papa character . No matter how hard I tried , I could n't keep him from looking angry . Maybe that 's because he always is . I liked my figure of the little boy better ; he was handsome and serious , like the thinker Paul always was . While even to my biased eyes , the image of my little vacant-eyed sister was beautiful . The sun was now overhead and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chalk . I spit on my people so I could keep on working . I was so absorbed with making the little figures come alive that I did n't hear Papa come up behind me until he shouted , " Camille ! " I started shaking because I was scared he 'd lecture me like he always does . But he did n't . Instead he stopped short with the strangest expression on his face , kind of screwed-up as if he 'd tasted a lemon , like the time when I drew a picture of the ocean and he said I was a little Rembrandt . Then he knelt by the mud hole and reached out with both hands for the Maman . Lifting it up as carefully as if it were one of her precious champagne glasses , he turned it from front to back and side to side over and over again . His eyes filled with tears . " Camille , " he said , swallowing hard , " these are very good . I 'm going to try to find you some real clay to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can with it . " " Oh Papa , I will ! I will ! " " Good . If you do as well with the clay as you have with this mud , I 'm going to show your statues to Alfred Boucher , the famous sculptor in Nogent-sur-Seine . Would you like that ? " " Oh Papa , yes ! Thank you ! I 'm so happy ! " I threw myself into his arms . He hugged me back , slimy hands , muddy boots , dripping dress , and all . I ran into the house singing a strange chaotic melody I 'd made up , a kind of prayer of thanks to the universe that came into my head when life pleased me , only to find Maman sitting by the window with her head in her hands . She was crying . She 's always crying . I knew it was no time to tell her about my little people and Papa 's plans for me . She never had any feeling for what I thought was important ; she just did n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's the matter ? " I asked dutifully , even though I already knew . She sat rocking back and forth in her tapestried chair and moaning . " My baby , my baby . " " Maman . " I said impatiently . " Henri died a long time ago , before I was in your tummy . " " It does n't matter ! " she shouted . " I will never get over him ! He was the love of my life , my first child . He was only fifteen days old when he died . " " I know , Maman , " I said grumpily , " when I was born the next year you were so disappointed I was n't a boy that you called me Camille , a name that can be given to either a boy or a girl . " But she continued as if she had n't heard me . " And then Louise arrived fourteen months later , before I had a chance to ... " " ... be a mother to me . I know all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you always wanted . Your beautiful , obedient Louise ! " " What are you saying , Camille ? You speak this way to your mother ? How dare you talk to me like that ! You do n't deserve to be in this distinguished family . Henri would never have behaved like you . I had hoped you would be like him , but you turned out to be a violent , vicious child ! It is your fault this family is always fighting . You know just how to set everyone against each other . Hold your tongue , or you will go to bed without your supper again ! " She was being unfair , as usual . What I said about my little sister Louise was one hundred percent correct , as any sensitive child would have picked up . She was born when I was only a year and two months old . I do n't remember it , of course , but I 've been told and told and told the story . Maman loved her right away . If she could have picked a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have chosen Louise , who was named after Maman , and seemed to know from the start she was destined to be her carbon copy . She was completely dependent on our mother and had no mind of her own . I loved to taunt her with it , and said to her once , " What will happen to the copy when the original is gone ? " Louise was what Maman valued above all else , a good baby . On the other hand , I 'm told that I cried every time she came near me , as if I knew in the womb that Maman did n't want me . I did n't take to her the way babies usually attach to their mothers , or let her comfort me . To make matters worse , when la bonne Hlne or Papa came into the room , I was all smiles , I think Maman has never forgiven me for that . In retaliation , she made it quite clear from her nasty comments that she could n't stand me . She got a sullen , pinched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if she suddenly smelled a skunk . I used to watch Maman and Louise with their heads together talking like girlfriends . Why did n't she ever talk with me like that ? Whenever I came near her she 'd move away . She never had two words to say to me that were n't a criticism . She ached for Henri , adored Louise and Paul , and skipped me altogether . Sometimes I wonder how much she would have loved Henri had he lived . Another reason she never loved me , although she 'd deny it from now to Kingdom Come , is that I was born with one leg a bit shorter than the other and I walk with a slight limp . Even though people say they do n't notice it , I do n't believe them . My rhythm is a bit off , so that my gait goes ump-up-ump-up , instead of ump-ump-ump-ump , like that of normal people . I 've always been self-conscious about my walk . When I pass people on the street , I check to see if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me cross the road , I think they 're being nice because I 'm lame . I wonder if anyone ever can really love a cripple . I used to believe that if only I walked like everybody else , my mother would be me . That must be why I 'm so fascinated by balance in my work . My figures , like those in La Valse , manage extraordinary feats of equilibrium , even if I myself stumble all over the place . I believe one reason I was a perfectionist in my work is that if I did n't have a completely intact body , I could always try for perfection in the bodies I sculpted . I guess that 's why I really never liked my perfect sister . My feelings are obvious in the statue I did of her when she was twenty . I call it Jeune fille aux yeux clos ( Young girl with closed eyes ) . She looks beautiful , but her eyes are closed , because she really sees nothing . Her expression is benign on the surface , but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underneath her faint smile . That 's not so strange , for she was jealous of me from the moment she was born . Unlike my other work , looking at this piece gives me nothing , just like Louise . The story in the family is that soon after she arrived , Papa said , " Camille , shall we keep her or send her back ? " I said , " Send her back . " He thought that was very funny , but of course Maman did n't , and has never let me forget it . The birth of Paul , which is my first real memory , was quite different . Papa put this sweet-smelling little bundle on my lap and said , " You have a little brother , ton petit Paul . " I put my finger in his hand and he closed his tiny fist around it . My heart pounded and my eyes teared up . I fell in love with him right then , and have loved him ever since . Another thing about Maman . She has n't had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand anybody who does . She 's just like all the other women she knows . Paul and I got the giggles when our tutor told us that her maiden name was Louise-Athanaise Cerveaux . As everyone knows , " cervean " in French means brain , mind , or mastermind , which Maman certainly is not . If I believed in God , I would think he had a great sense of humor and selected her name as a celestial joke . Being so conventional , she objects whenever I show any imagination or think anything that has never occurred to her . Maman is a perfect example of someone who values good form above all else and has no use for my way of thinking or my art . And of course Louise has never had an unconventional idea in her life . It 's a good thing for me that we had Hlne , or I would really belong in this den of iniquity I 've lived in for thirty years . I learned a lot about maids when I eavesdropped on the weekly chatting circle of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me or their husbands spending all their free time with buddies at the cafes , they mostly complained about the impossibility of getting good work out of their servants . I learned as the women sat at their embroidery and chitchatted away that they thought the bonnes were good-tempered and well-mannered , but insensitive to the subtleties of French cooking and the fine care of a household . Because the bonnes came from peasant stock ( Hlne is Alsatian ) they understood nothing about the art of maintaining a lovely home . They could not be taught to cook , except when constantly watched , nor could they be trusted to handle china or glass such as Maman 's fragile crystal ware without breaking it . They burned the food Maman nursed along for hours to reach the required state of perfection . Even if a maid had done something well a hundred times , let the mistress turn her back once , and the bonne was sure to do it wrong the hundred-and-first time . Most important of all , the housekeepers whispered over their stitching , when there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to the intelligence and knowledge of the lady of the house , namely the woman doing the complaining , ( usually Maman ) . It 's true that these women were scientific house administrators and able to run their households with far more skill than their servants . But the bonnes were very clean and excellent at hard work like digging in the garden , cleaning the outhouse , fetching water , fattening up poultry , washing down the buggy , harnessing the horses , making butter , and carrying heavy logs . They were a delight to have around because the harder they worked the louder they laughed and sang . What a contrast to Maman 's grouchy griping ! Hlne had gentle , far-reaching eyes that took in everything and a quiet , amused smile . Whatever the season , she tied a kerchief around her shoulders and wore a grey bonnet , a petticoat she had spun herself from the wool of sheep and dyed red , and an apron over her long woolen skirt . She was naturally polite and kind , and did things like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice soap and Calisson when she went to visit her family . I only saw her upset once . When I was about seven years old , I heard a sobbing in the back of the kitchen . I ran in and it was Hlne crying bitterly . I knelt at her feet , saying , " What is it , Hlne ? What 's wrong ? Did Maman scold you again ? " Papa must have heard me and came in and put his arm around me . He said , " Let her alone , Camille . Something terrible has happened . " " What is it Papa ? What 's the matter with Hlne ? " " You know we 've been at war with the Prussians . France has lost , " he said sadly . " Hlne 's home in Alsace is n't part of France anymore . The government says she 's now a German . Her nieces and nephews wo n't even be allowed to talk French in their school after today . " I did n't understand how Hlne could be French like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cry too . But in a few days she was back to her pleasant self and nobody ever talked to me about it again . Except sometimes at night I heard her crying in her bed . I really liked my bust of Hlne . Every time I looked at it , my first impulse was to laugh , but when I looked again it made me sad . It 's as if she were smiling her warm crooked smile to keep away the tears . It said she knew what life was really about , and had no need to blab about it all the time like Maman and her accomplices . Although Hlne understood that life can be awful and lonely and sad , she loved it anyway . Strong and wise like the giant stones on the moor , she never fooled herself . I learned from her how to be direct and honest , and I would not trade those lessons for all the degrees of the Sorbonne . Hlne was a wonderful woman . How I wish she were with me now . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , that we had Hlne . Everyone in our family was always fighting : Maman with Papa , Maman with the children , Papa with the children , Louise with Paul , Paul with me , and worst of all , Louise and me . We fought over everything , which one got a larger slice of pie , who sat next to Papa at the dinner table , whose dress was prettier . I remember once my godfather brought me and my sister some candy . The two pieces were wrapped festively in colored paper and were identical , except that the paper around one was pink and the other blue . Would you believe we both wanted the pink one ? Or maybe it was the blue , I do n't remember . I only know we wanted the same piece . We fought for an hour over which one would get the coveted candy , slapping and kicking each other until Maman took both pieces away . We never saw them again . ( Did you eat them , Maman ? ) When we kept on fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " If you 're going to kill each other , do it outside . I 've just finished cleaning . " Hlne was the only one who could get us to stop quarreling . She had only to look at us firmly and crinkle her forehead to make us stop . With her tranquil personality , she was our shelter in a stormy household . As usual when Maman hurt my feelings , I rushed outside to my favorite spot in the whole world , Le Geyn , a stunning moor filled with huge weird rocks that had been left on the outskirts of Villeneuve by glaciers eons ago . It was known as la Hotte du Diable , The Devil 's Basket . According to local myths , the hill of rocks had been formed by the devil who agreed to build a convent overnight in return for the soul of the contractor . The devil crammed a huge basket with gigantic stones and proceeded to build Le Geyn . We never heard what happened to the contractor , but the rocks remain like frozen giants throughout eternity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , marvelous caves to curl up in , and mythological beings like in legends and fairy tales . Paul and I had a fairyland for a playground , and I had the finest sculpture matres in existence to teach me the basics of my art . ( Continues ... )
