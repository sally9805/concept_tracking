Section : Executive Edition Forget a quiet game of golf . Some folks make business networking a real adventure <p> Stephanie Forte , a marketing consultant in Las Vegas , was trying to get down to business with a client not long ago , and it was n't working . <p> The client , the owner of a company that helps produce trade shows and films , was launching a new business line and negotiating a partnership . He wanted to get Forte 's input on some big-picture issues . But a steady flow of phone calls and other interruptions stalled the conversation . So Forte , a skilled rock climber who had met her client while scaling nearby Mount Charleston , suggested they reconvene for an early-morning climb . <p> " It worked perfectly , " she says . " My client was able to detach , and we were able to come to some conclusions about his company 's plans . " <p> Business people used to head to the nearest golf club when they needed to network or get colleagues and clients away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for executives and entrepreneurs who are too active and overscheduled for a leisurely and time-consuming day on the fairways , adventure sports are a better fit . <p> " There is still a need for social , interactive activities outside of the office that allow for relationship building . But golf takes a lot of time , and you do n't get much exercise , " says Maurice Schweitzer , an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania 's Wharton School , who studies business relationships . " People are more active , more health conscious , and more individualistic today . They want to do things that reflect their own personality . And adventure sports can give you an intense experience without taking the entire Saturday . " <p> These sports have become more mainstream , accessible , and upscale in recent years , making them more conducive to being used for business . Americans ' participation in kayaking grew 23 percent between 2003 and 2005 , according to the Outdoor Industry Foundation , a trade group . Rock climbing was up nearly 6 percent , hiking 5 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more than half of the Americans who participated in outdoor sports in the United States in 2005 were older than 35 , according to the foundation , and 27 percent had household incomes that exceeded $80,000 a year , compared with only 10 percent in that group in 1999 . <p> Some of these folks are discovering adventure sports as adults , but many pursued them when they were younger and have n't given up being active as they 've grown older . They also do n't feel the need to fit a certain mold the way all those men in gray flannel suits did once upon a time . " I do n't feel like because I hit a certain age I have to become a grown-up and play golf instead of climbing , " says Forte , 39 , who learned to climb while spending a few years after college working at a resort and snowboarding in Aspen , Colo . <p> No distractions . The sports that provide the best opportunities for networking and relationship building share one common aspect with golf . They buy people time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about business on a deeper level . They might even do a better job than golf does of getting people away from the petty distractions of the office , the cellphone , and the BlackBerry . As Paul Schaye , 54 , the managing director for Chestnut Hill Partners , a private equity firm in New York , puts it , " You 're not answering your cellphone when you 're going downhill on a bike at 40 miles per hour . " <p> For many executives , that 's a good thing . Cathey Finlon , 60 , the CEO of McClain Finlon , an advertising agency in Denver , has always been active and outdoorsy . Her husband plays golf , but she finds it " too slow " and instead prefers skiing and bike riding . She 's taken a series of long-distance rides during vacations where she 's met other business owners and executives . On one ride in Vietnam from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi , she hit it off with another entrepreneur whose cycling pace matched her own , and she recalls , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were reading , decisions we were making , ideas we were working on . " <p> But the attraction for some is that you do n't have to be away for days at a time on a distant continent to have a satisfying experience practicing these sports or to use them to grease the gears of your business relationships . A climber with a mountain nearby can get out of bed early , do a series of short climbs , and still be in the office at 9 a.m . A surfer in Southern California can catch a few waves on the way home from work to release the day 's stress and run into other surfers doing the same thing . <p> Additionally , these sports are highly individualistic , require discipline , and tend to inspire intensity in their adherents . So practitioners see them as not just things they do but reflections of who they are , and they readily identify with others who share their passions . <p> Forte settled in Las Vegas so that she would have mountains nearby and went into business for herself so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever she wanted . She says her clients who are also climbers understand her lifestyle choices more easily than those who are n't , and thus " a significant chunk of my business are people I meet through climbing . " <p> Schaye recounts a weekend in the Hamptons on Long Island , N.Y. , when he saw someone cycling alone and invited him to join his group . It turned out to be another banker whom he 'd talked to on the phone but had never met . " We talked and got to be friends , and by the end of the ride we said we should find a way to work together , " he recalls . They have n't ridden together since , but they did reconnect during a few investment deals their firms shared . And when Schaye wanted to start Chestnut Hill a few years later , this fellow rider persuaded his firm to put up the seed money . <p> Trust . Then there 's the team-building aspect of adventure sports . " We interact with more strangers and have to get to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Maybe after 10 years of golfing with you I 'll feel a great bond with you , but it might only take two rappelling trips or a handful of rafting trips to feel really close with someone . " <p> The bonding happens so quickly , he says , because whether someone is helping you change a flat bicycle tire in the middle of nowhere or holding your belaying ropes on a cliff face , " you 're relying on the other person to keep you safe . That builds instant trust , and the trust transcends the experience . " <p> Bill Hinz , the CEO of Western National Bank in Phoenix , excels at creating these kinds of experiences for his employees and clients . He and other members of the local Entrepreneurs Organization have mountain biked in Colorado , ocean kayaked in California , and shot along zip lines way above the jungle floor in Mexico . " When you push yourselves to the limit in these situations where you have to trust each other , " Hinz says , " you break down barriers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . " <p> These situations also let you know quickly what a person is made of and if you want to do business with him or her . " I 'll see someone fall off a wall and start yelling at their belayer and blaming the sun or the weather or the equipment instead of just admitting they need to focus better or practice more , " says Forte . She will steer clear of that person both as a climbing buddy and as a business associate . <p> Similarly , Schaye says his rule is " on a long-distance ride , if I start with you , I finish with you . I do n't leave anyone behind " when a tire pops , gears fail , or there 's an injury . If fellow riders " leave you in the lurch to finish a bike ride , what are they going to do in a business situation when stuff really hits the fan ? " he asks . <p> But aside from the character factor , there 's also the sheer intensity of experience these sports provide . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking any recreational time out , even if they 're mixing business with pleasure . <p> " Golf is structured in such a way that there is no chance anything incredible will happen during a round , " says Hinz , so while he grew up playing the game in Arizona , he aims higher when he wants to impress someone . The CEO , whose bank puts together real-estate investment deals , brought several investors together last winter to buy land in Utah . To give them a look at the property , he flew them there in a small plane and had snowmobiles waiting . There was 3 feet of snow on the ground , and while it took these Sun Belt business people an hour or so to get the hang of the vehicles , once they did , " they were zipping around the property at 60 miles an hour and talking about it for days afterward , " Hinz recalls . " I guarantee they 'll be investors in anything else we do from now on . " <p> It 's become easier to do these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bones , both of which appeal to business people . <p> Andrea Nierenberg , the author of Million Dollar Networking and a consultant on building business relationships , routinely brings business cards with her when she hikes and-no surprise-has struck up several business relationships that way . But she usually does her trekking during spa weekends around the country . <p> When Hinz 's group of entrepreneurs went to California last year , they spent their days ocean kayaking and hiking along seaside cliffs . But at night they rested their weary bones in featherbeds at the Ritz-Carlton , Half Moon Bay . <p> " I make it a point to budget a considerable amount of my income toward these activities , " he says . " We 're not trying to suffer ; we 're just trying to put together events that are active and memorable and amazing . " <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : NO PHONES .
