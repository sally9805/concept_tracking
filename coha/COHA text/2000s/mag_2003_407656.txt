My seven-year-old still ca n't ride a two-wheeler . She ca n't play chess and she 's never been downhill skiing . I feel miserable about this wildly deprived state of affairs . But how can I possibly teach her these things above the din of a four-year-old 's cries to " make me a house , " and despite a two-year-old 's efforts to take apart the cordless phone , and in conjunction with an infant who never seems to break suction from my breast ? Every morning I wrestle with how to keep such a diverse set of ages entertained , educated and challenged . Surely there are strategies for keeping all the kids stimulated  --  at the same time . As a matter of fact , there are . And finding a way to integrate everybody in something shared is not only the unavoidable choice  --  it 's the best one . Anna Kirova , assistant professor of education at the University of Alberta , explains that mixed-age groupings are good for children 's learning because of the intellectual and social demands they make of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mixed-age setting , it 's a good idea to expose her to younger and older kids occasionally  --  for the same reasons . ) " If everybody is at the same level of understanding of something , they do n't challenge one another when they ask questions , " says Kirova . " And to explain something to a child who is younger than you , you really have to know what you 're talking about . " Janette Pelletier , assistant professor at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education at the University of Toronto ( OISE/UT ) , takes this notion further , suggesting that parents discuss and even celebrate their kids ' different ages and stages . Older kids find the child-development stuff fascinating , she says . " You 're observing their stages of development and finding it interesting , so why not share it ? " says Pelletier . Read on for tips on activities with mass appeal . Routine Solutions When Valerie and Drew Ellis moved with their four daughters to a new subdivision in Aurora , Ontario , last year , the youngest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cleary , Teghan and Braedyn were dying to get outside and explore their new surroundings . But the subdivision was so new that there were no lawns or sidewalks yet , and Valerie had to insist her kids stay indoors . " The older ones wanted to go off riding their bikes , but I could n't supervise them because of the younger one , " she recalls . " I had to really pull them in . That was a very long summer . " The lawns and sidewalks are in place now , and so is Ellis 's solution for how to simultaneously address the needs of her different-aged children  --  devising a routine and sticking to it . Her part-time job gets her home just before the kids . When they pile in , they do homework straight away . At four o'clock , she feeds them dinner to stave off the usual witching period with full bellies . Afterwards , and on the weekends , Ellis guides them through " together " activities like arts and crafts at the kitchen table . The predictable rollout of activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accept what demands she can  --  and ca n't  --  meet . Just Do It The very idea of managing four kids in a pool leaves some parents all wet  --  but not Carolyn Madonia . This Toronto mom does n't hesitate to take her brood of bathers  --  Jacob , eight , Nicola , six , Nathan , four , and Evelyn , two , for regular dips . The oldest two are competent swimmers . Nathan swims with a life jacket or a bathing suit with built-in floats . Mom supervises Evelyn . In the winter , they all go skating , too , and the kids take turns pushing Evelyn around the ice in her stroller . " I do n't let stuff hold me back , " says Madonia . " It 's just a matter of doing it . You can make anything happen . " Because Madonia 's all-for-one attitude is presented as a day-to-day reality in her family , her seven-year-old does n't question enjoying time with his baby sister . Back home , the group regularly gravitates toward the Duplo set . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas , and which still captures the imagination of the entire family . " We have some really cool Duplo that even Jacob will still play with . " Or they might all slip down the basement to push some Brio trains around the track . Bridge the Gap Madonia 's no-fuss attitude meets with Sara Dimerman 's approval . The director of a parent education resource centre in Thornhill , Ontario , says there 's no need to fret about how to blend different stages . Parents , she says , should realize that some activities are not restricted by age . When Dimerman 's 11-year-old daughter , Talia , put on a CD recently and informed her mother and three-year-old sister , Chloe , that she was going to be the dance instructor and they were the students , everyone got into the act . For the next 20 minutes , the eight years separating the children disappeared . Dress-up , says Dimerman , is another good bet for her daughters . Even a three-year-old can pull on costumes , she says , and then everybody can put on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeding the younger one lines . At craft time , Dimerman spreads an array of materials on the dining table  --  from fatter crayons for smaller hands to fine liners for more adept fingers  --  and lets the kids at it . If they wander into the kitchen in search of mom , she might get them baking . " It 's kind of messy , " says Dimerman , " but you can assign different tasks to children depending on their level of ability . A three-year-old can pour chocolate chips into the mix ; an 11-year-old can help blend the batter with an electric mixer . " If it 's a more structured game they 're after , the girls might pull out the Twister mat . " Twister 's great , " enthuses Dimerman . " It teaches the younger children colours and the older children dexterity . " You can also play board games in teams , pairing less-skilled with more-skilled players . And some companies have fastened on to the divergent-ages dilemma and make single puzzles with large and small pieces so the entire family can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still , advises Dimerman , do n't become so obsessed with finding clever age-bridgers that you overlook simple stuff , like going out for ice cream or reading . In fact , as Toronto teacher Kyla Lightfoot has found , some pursuits that cater to different ages bloom out of everyday life with kids . On bath night , Lightfoot will spill a bag of foam letters into the water with her seven-year-old daughter , Ashmir , and her three-year-old daughter , Karensa , and then watch as Ashmir starts working through the letter sounds with her little sister . " A big thing is letting them have time to develop the relationship , " Lightfoot says . " We always think that one or the other is going to be bored . We plan playgroups and activities that put each of the children with their own peer groups . But if we 'd just give them time and space together , I think we 'd be surprised at what they can do on their own . " Making Adjustments Beverley Cathcart-Ross would agree . The Toronto parent educator says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mom and dad need to lower their standards a little . She believes parents often delude themselves about how neatly all the pieces of their perfect , planned family activities will fall into place , and then beat themselves up when the older kid begs off to be with friends , or the little one complains of boredom . Expecting a family game of Monopoly to follow every letter of the rules , for example , is probably an exercise in frustration . Instead , make some alterations . Have your four-year-old play banker so he gets to hand out the houses and hotels , put the money in the jackpot and hold the property cards for his parents . " If you give them a job , they feel they can contribute and that they were noticed , " says Cathcart-Ross , who has four children . Sure , this kind of approach changes the dynamic of a games night , but , she adds , parents might be amazed at how much their kids are willing to adapt . " It 's not like four 12-year-olds playing a game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Experiences Part of the value of doing things together as a family is to provide some common ground for conversation later on . Everyone can enjoy a family trip to the zoo or to a fireworks show , and then talk about it back at home . " It just gets conversation going , " says Janette Pelletier . " I 'm not against watching family television together , either . That also provides an experience that you can share and talk about . " Back at my house , we 're sharing the view of my two-year-old son , Finn , as he storms the fort my daughters Kenya and Malindi ( seven and four ) have made out of wooden blocks for their guinea pigs . The scene ends , as so many do , in tears . " Let 's try again , " I holler over the din . I suggest that Kenya and Malindi claim all of the red and blue blocks , and that Finn gets the yellow ones . We watch as Finn picks only the yellow pieces from the wreckage . Kenya and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a third structure , and to suggest they all create a three-room guinea pig mansion . Finn is delighted to be included , and starts stacking . No one knocks any one else 's edifice down and , for a moment , peace settles on our family room . And then nine-month-old Kai , still trying out her crawling legs , makes a trip through the entire construction site and destroys the family idyll  --  just as she does the guinea pigs ' shelter .
