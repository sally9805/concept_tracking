The Return of a Millennial Social Movement // EVER SINCE SEATTLE erupted into a freetrade fighting zone during the World Trade Organization 's 1999 meeting , the very scheduling of a global economic gathering has become a provocation to activists worldwide . What happened suddenly in Seattle has been transformed into rituals of resistance like that enacted in Quebec City at the 34-nation Summit of the Americas in April . Whether these rites have helped make the global economy more sacred or less profane is disputable . They have at least demonstrated that the party of globalization has a potent opposition , or perhaps that economic globalization itself has matured into a two-party system . The opposition party is scattered and wide . You could call it a big church , and indeed quite probably the most phenomenal piece of it is a largely faith-driven movement of protestors with their own rituals . They probably would n't whack down a chain-link fence like the one erected to keep out demonstrators in Quebec City , but they love putting on chains to symbolize the bondage of poor nations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masked anarchists did in Seattle two years ago , but they did burn a laptop computer outside a rich-nation summit in Okinawa last summer . These are debt campaigners , who collected the world 's largest petition-signed by over 24 million supporters of debt cancellation for the most desperately poor countries . More than that , they dragged rich nations into pledging more international debt relief than anyone could have imagined possible a few years ago . And they did so while intoning obscure verses from the Hebrew Scriptures calling for debt forgiveness every " seven times seven " years-among other social deeds aimed at restoring economic equilibrium . Now , the debt  --  relief . forces , having been ' animated by the biblical tradition of the jubilee year , are arrayed for a new engagement , possibly on the wider stage of global finance and trade . But there 's also the possibility that the Cinderella coach that drove this improbable millennial band really turned into a global pumpkin at the ring of midnight , Dec. 31 , 2000 . Seattle 1999 has defined the broader , so-called " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the myth of mass origins is Birmingham , England , 1998 . That is where 70,000 of them formed a human chain to hoist external debt onto the international agenda during the summer meeting of the Group of Seven industrialized nations . " They were mainstream politically , and in fact , many were fairly conservative . And that really struck the decisionmakers who were present there , " recalls Adrian Lovett , who directs a new campaign called Drop the Debt , based in London : ground zero of jubilee mobilization . " These were not Seattle-style young people , though we certainly had a lot of young people . By and large , they were the churchgoing public of the middle classes . And that of course is a very powerful constituency when it 's mobilized . " // The rituals were striking and somewhat curious even to Lovett , who came to the Jubilee 2000 movement from political rather than religious precincts , as a 20-something former Labor Party legislative aide and before that , a disc jockey . ( He describes himself as a baptized Catholic who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that year before Birmingham , Lovett had trekked to one jubilee debt event after another in villages around England . " And it always seemed to involve chaining up the local vicar , " he said with some amused detachment earlier this spring in London , where we met up at The Wesley Cafe at Methodist Central Hall , Westminster . There were many sorts of shackles , real and paper-made , to symbolize debt bondage . Speaking at the closing celebration of Jubilee 2000 in London 's Trafalgar Square late last year , Lovett felt moved to note that in the course of the campaign , he had " seen more vicars in chains than is probably healthy . " One irony of the biblically motored jubilee bandwagon is that it took off and caught on sensationally in the United Kingdom , which has been largely de-Christianized over the past few decades . While Quebec City was this year 's Mecca of global resistance , for debt relievers it will be Genoa , Italy . That is where fleets of them are expected to come and call for an ultimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on July 20-23 , with provisional member Russia added to the rich seven . ( Last year in Okinawa , jubilee activists were furious when the G-8 deemed the " digital divide " a more respectable item of deliberation than poor  --  nation debt . So in a heretical gesture against the digerati , they torched a laptop . ) Campaigners want the World Bank and International Monetary Fund , basically controlled by the seven , to wipe clean the debt slate of the worst-off countries . G-8 leaders say they and their institutions have forgiven quite enough debt-up to one-half of the amount owed to them by 22 hard-pressed countries . Actually , the more realistic figure is a bit under one-third , which represents the effective cut in debt-service payments . At any rate , " It 's just not enough , just not commensurate with the scale of human suffering in those countries , " insists Henry Northover , a policy analyst with the Catholic relief agency CAFOD , headquartered in London 's downcast neighborhood of Brixton . He and other Genoa-bound campaigners have a point . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative , on average they will still put out more in debt payments than they spend on health care or education . Meanwhile , countries will face in return stricter financial " conditionalities " of the kind embedded in International Monetary Fund-designed Structural Adjustment Programs , which often include-among other adjustments-charging citizens prohibitive " user fees " for primary schooling or basic health care . Many developing-world campaigners are livid to the point of smelling a debt-relief hoax . How much steam the jubilee debt-relief engine has left in it is hard to judge . It is , after all , a millennial movement , and a successful one at that . By the end of last year , it had rightly come to be regarded as the world 's most successful single-issue campaign since the struggle that toppled the apartheid system of racial subjugation in South Africa . Scarcely anyone thinks that serious relief would have flowed back to many impoverished countries without Jubilee 2000 . If the debt campaign 's Cinderella coach did n't shrink into a pumpkin at year 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millennial theme is a quickly " diminishing asset " - as readily acknowledged by Lovett , whose organization , Drop the Debt , is designed as a short-life successor to the Jubilee 2000 organization . On that , he would get no argument from the LM.E or World Bank . Officials of the latter especially.have saluted the " historic contribution " of Jubilee 2000 to combating world misery , as a policy aide , Anthony Gaeta , allowed by telephone from Washington . " Historic , " through , is the shrewdly operative word in that praise . Essentially , the World Bank is calling on jubilee battalions to declare victory and go home , or move onto something else , like child poverty . Gaeta and other officials argue that the third world debt is now sustainable , meaning it no longer hinders development and social well-being . Of course , they said that in the mid-1990 's , when the debt burden was clearly catastrophic . Still , the load has been lightened , and admittedly there is much else to do , like beating back the internal demons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Genoa , what comes of jubilee intensity in a post-jubilee time ? Does it follow the letter of Leviticus , the prime biblical text calling for absolute debt forgiveness ( along with the freeing of slaves and return of land lost to indebtedness ) ? Or is that a case of financial fundamentalism , as some intimate ? Do the millennial forces regroup on the broader battlefield of globalization ? How ? Much of this is still to be revealed . At the New Economics Foundation , a London think tank , Ann Pettifor is mustering a new initiative called Jubilee Plus , another official successor to Jubilee 2000 , which she directed . Jubilee Plus is fixing to highlight the root causes of the debt crisis-which in Pettifor 's understanding are the bitterly unjust structures of international finance that are stacked in favor of creditors , investors and shareholders . She wants to stretch the jubilee year analysis , of a piece with the Sabbath and every-seven-year sabbatical traditions , in that broad direction . In ancient Israel , the exhortations included letting land rest and sharing whatever it yielded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notion of discipline that defies the near anarchy of globe-trotting finance . Other jubilee stalwarts are pushing down other trails . In Washington , at the U.S. Catholic Conference and Bread for the World ( an ecumenical Christian anti-hunger lobby ) , this year 's most favored poor-nation issue is American foreign aid , not debt . That is chiefly because the United States ranks dead last among rich countries in its dispersal of international development assistance . Yet that choice also betrays doubt about whether 100 percent debt cancellation-the Drop the Debt agenda-is morally imperative . In Britain , relief agencies , including CAFOD , are propelling that agenda but also looking beyond Genoa to complex questions such as free and fair trade . This appears to be the dual direction of the Vatican , where Pope John Paul II clearly feels the debt crusade is not over . There are ready explanations of why the jubilee contingent has made strides where others have made only noise . All have something to do with being issue  --  focused , non-ideological and faithbased . These virtues led to a preposterous coalition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congressmen , while sparing us the woollier critiques of global capitalism . Jesse Helms and others could see the face of debt , the Africans and Latin Americans aided by agencies like CAFOD and Catholic Relief Services , the thousands of children who die every day because of notoriously preventable illnesses . After a wholly unexpected debt  --  relief triumph in Congress last fall , David Bryden of Jubilee 2000 USA remarked on one lesson to be learned from the cause : that " we should not be so cynical that we no longer rely on moral arguments to win support from politicians . " Cast further , debt-relief disciples have not been afraid to ride this once-arcane policy debate , this affair of international finance , onto some stretch of transcendental terrain , some ground of ultimate concern . It is hard to think of a squishier sentiment from any Realpolitik perspective , yet it is equally hard to picture a spunkier start for a far-reaching , faith-rooted movement of global engagement , if that is to come . Author Affiliation WILLIAM BOLE , a journalist living in Lowell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center at Georgetown University in Washington , D.C. // <p>                     @x Sitting down to eat his lunch at a neurological hospital in Lyon , France , where he was conducting research , Dr. Will Clower could hardly believe what he saw . " There was a cask of red wine , " he recalls , " with free refills for the doctors . " <p> For him , the scene proved a perfect illustration of the difference in the way the French view wine , compared with most Americans . In France , wine is not seen primarily as an intoxicant -- first and foremost , it 's food . And its moderate but regular consumption may be one of the reasons the French fare better on a number of measures of health , despite their love for foods that we would typically view as unhealthy . <p> Resveratrol , a highly active compound found in the skin of stressed red grapes , is a key player in protecting against heart and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking red wine can result in numerous health benefits , says Dr. Joseph Maroon , a professor of neuroscience at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and the longtime team neurosurgeon for the Pittsburgh Steelers . He details the studies in his new book , The Longevity Factor : How Resveratrol and Red Wine Activate Genes for a Longer and Healthier Life . <p> Dr. Maroon says scientific studies suggest resveratrol , a substance found in red wine and a number of other foods , can protect against heart disease , cancer , and neurological diseases . It can also help prevent some infections ; serve as an antiviral ; reduce obesity ; protect against some forms of diabetes ; and slow the effects of aging . He 's among the increasing number of scientists who believe resveratrol to be a primary factor in the French paradox : the puzzling low rate of heart attack deaths in France when compared with the United States , even though the French on average eat many more grams of fat a day -- 60 percent more cheese , three times more pork , and four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physician , but this is really the future , " says Dr. William Gruss , a Florida cardiologist and internist , and author of A Cardiologist 's Guide to Anti-Aging , Antioxidants &; Resveratrol . He sees benefits to the heart , vascular system , brain , nervous system , and skin , as well as the possibility of cancer prevention . What 's more , he adds , consumption of red wine and resveratrol is by and large compatible with most traditional medicine . " If you can find something that will not hurt you and will probably help you , and not interfere with traditional medicine , I 'm all for it . " <p> How It Works . Put simply , resveratrol protects humans because it protects plants . The substance is produced when a plant -- in this case , a grapevine -- becomes stressed , perhaps by weather , but often by fungus or other disease . Resveratrol collects in the skin of the grape , helping the grape to ward off the stressor . <p> The reason resveratrol levels are highest in red wine as opposed to white is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a much longer portion of the winemaking process . It 's what makes red wine red and allows more resveratrol to remain in the finished product . <p> Among reds , resveratrol levels tend to be highest in pinot noir . Why ? As actor Paul Giamatti 's character in the wine flick Sideways explained it : " It 's thin-skinned , temperamental , ripens early . " With its thin skin , the pinot noir grape must produce more resveratrol to protect itself . So must the grapes produced in higher altitudes , as are many used in the wines from Chile , the Burgundy region of France , and the Finger Lakes region of New York , Dr. Maroon says . <p> Resveratrol , he explains , appears to activate what are known as the sirtuin genes -- sometimes referred to as scarcity or longevity genes . Research in the 1980s found that yeast colonies lived significantly longer if scientists restricted the amount of glucose that they fed on . Subsequent studies suggested that this scarcity caused the sirtuin gene to kick in , resulting in greater longevity . The question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genes in humans without reducing calorie consumption ? <p> Resveratrol is among a number of substances that have recently been labeled sirtuin-activating compounds . Most of these substances are **26;11261;TOOLONG also found in such foods as dark chocolate , green tea , onions , apples , and other fruits and vegetables . " In a bottle of wine there are 1 to 3 milligrams of resveratrol , but also hundreds of other polyphenol compounds that are also very health-providing , and many of which also activate the sirtuin gene , " Dr. Maroon says . <p> Is It Necessary to Drink Wine ? Not surprisingly , given the benefits associated with resveratrol , supplements are starting to flood the market . According to Dr. Maroon , more than 200 supplements with resveratrol are out there , and pharmaceutical companies are searching for ways to mimic or amplify the benefits through drugs . <p> Supplementation makes it possible to ingest resveratrol at higher levels than can be found naturally . Even wines with the highest levels of resveratrol may deliver only a couple of milligrams a day to the person who drinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the answer to the French paradox , even that small amount may be beneficial . <p> On the other hand , animal studies of resveratrol supplementation have involved much larger doses with few apparent ill effects and many benefits . As Maroon points out , many researchers studying in this field take supplements themselves , " voting with their actions . " <p> That is certainly preferable to consuming wine at levels beyond moderation . " The most important thing is moderation , " says Dr. Michael Ozner , a cardiologist and author of The Miami Mediterranean Diet . That means up to a 5-ounce glass per day for women , or up to two glasses per day for men . <p> Consumption at those levels , Dr. Ozner adds , is linked to a host of benefits . " Unfortunately , there 's a dark side of alcohol , which is what makes us as physicians hesitant to recommend alcohol to people who do n't drink . " Beyond the obvious perils of addiction and the risks of auto accidents and violent crime , overindulgence in alcohol is linked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain cancers -- virtually the opposite of the positive effects of resveratrol . <p> In any case , he says red wine is just part of the diet required to make a difference in health . <p> Dr. Clower , director of Mediterranean Wellness , agrees that what is important is approaching food with the right attitude . " You can eat anything on the planet as long as it 's a food , and you have it in control . " In France , wine is considered a food ; therefore , " when you eat food , of course you have wine . " <p> But that means food in moderation , too . " When they choose food , they choose high-quality and a lower quantity . They taste -- they do n't gobble , " Dr. Clower says . Red wine fits that philosophy nicely , because people are more likely to sip rather than guzzle . As for the doctors in the French hospital cafeteria that served red wine , " I never saw anybody going back for seconds . " <p> By Steve Kaelble <p>     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
