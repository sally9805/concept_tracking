<p> Donalsonville  --  It was only a matter of time before the veneer of racial civility faded away in places like Seminole County , where parents and children have dusted off age-old claims of racism and retribution . <p> It comes as no big surprise , given the General Assembly this year emasculated Georgia 's Confederacy-honoring flag and replaced it with a more innocuous , yet still divisive , banner . <p> Many Georgians vowed in January to protest the new flag , which they insisted diminishes their rebel-steeped heritage . All they needed was a chance . <p> They found it in this southwest Georgia county between the Chattahoochee and Flint rivers . <p> Nine students from Seminole County Middle/High School joined lawyers with the American Civil Liberties Union in Atlanta in suing the school board over its prohibition of T-shirts emblazoned with the Confederate flag emblem . <p> The lawsuit is also perceived by many as a thumb-in-your-eye swipe at the new state flag . <p> " It all started when the flag was changed , " says Billy Shingler Jr. , a ninth-grade plaintiff at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thought that since the flag was changed , they can have our T-shirts banned . " <p> Seminole Principal Jesse McLeod , strained and a bit nervous from all the hullabaloo , said last week he received complaints from about 10 students and four teachers , all black and all insistent the shirts were offensive . <p> Christal Moore was one of those students . <p> " The majority of African-American students feel that flag represents enslavement and they feel uncomfortable with it , " says Christal , the class valedictorian who 'll attend Georgia Tech next year . " The Confederate battle flag was carried into war and they are basically carrying that war into school and we do n't appreciate that . " <p> William Shingler Sr. , an attorney and municipal court judge in Donalsonville , was incensed by the school board 's action and contacted the ACLU . He is now vilified by many of the town 's blacks . <p> " If you do n't stand up and fight for your rights , you will lose them , " he says . " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racist issue . " <p> One day , Billy Shingler and his pals could wear without trouble their deer-hunting , cockfighting and bull-riding shirts gilded with Rebel flags . <p> The next day , they were hauled to the principal 's office . It all happened within a week of the General Assembly 's blitzkrieg assault on the former flag . <p> Each time students wore flag-adorned T-shirts , they were told to change it or turn it inside out . The principal says all students complied , readily and without lip . He fears the worse , however . <p> " You can tell there 's tension from six months ago to now , " says McLeod , in charge of 965 students in the combined middle and high school split evenly between whites and blacks . " Some people are not as friendly as they used to be . . . . We certainly have not had any instances to happen . But if this thing continues , there 's a possibility something will happen . That 's my gut feeling . " <p> It may seem odd for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love of the racially divisive Confederate banner . But the civil liberties group puts its passion for free speech above most else , and has even represented the Ku Klux Klan . <p> The lawsuit filed last week in federal court labels the school 's ban on Confederate flag clothing " an impermissible restriction on free expression " and an " arbitrary imposition of censorship . " <p> It further states the school system can document no evidence the clothes have been disruptive ; the school 's attorney admitted as much . The suit points out that kids wore the clothing last year without reprimand . <p> " They 're changing the rules as they go along , " says Mason Mosley , 15 , whose Confederate Bull Riding shirt got him in trouble . " If I want to be a racist , I 'd come with a KKK shirt on . " <p> Adds Dell Shingler , Billy 's mom : " These are just Southern country boys . It 's what they all wear . They did n't offend anybody before . " <p> They have now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Kenyon White , a black eighth-grader . " They may not think they 're offending me or hurting other people . But they are . " <p> The school 's handbook says clothing " that might be offensive to others " is prohibited . White , Moore and other black students and teachers point out that shirts with likenesses of Malcolm X and other African-American leaders were banned at Seminole a few years back  --  at the insistence of offended whites . <p> It is an irony not lost on some Seminole blacks who note that whites are now clamoring for the courts to defend an icon of their own . They also note that the state of Georgia , to some extent , seems to sanction the wearing of Confederate clothing . <p> The new state flag , for example , with its smaller yet still visible Confederate portion , flies in front of the school . It was n't until last week that the old state flag was removed from the school 's cafeteria . <p> " This had n't been an issue until Gov . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Ella Moore , Christal 's mother , who has taught 30 years at Seminole . " It 's like ( the plaintiffs ) are retaliating because the flag was changed . It 's like , ' We 're not going accept it . We 're going to rebel . ' " <p> Whites , blacks , parents , teachers , attorneys  --  they all agree the flag change fueled the revolt . <p> " Unfortunately , that emblem remains on the official Georgia flag . And it still sends the same message , " says Gerry Weber , legal director of the ACLU , which nonetheless supported the change . But " the school system 's own display of the very image they 're trying to censor makes the case particularly compelling . " <p> The ACLU has monitored the slew of Confederate flag confrontations between Georgia students ( and parents ) and school systems since the flag was changed in late January . Most have occured in Georgia 's rural belt stretching from Savannah to Donalsonville . <p> In Richmond Hill , a middle-schooler defied the clothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle school principal said Confederate shirts sparked " rumors of threats and impending fights . " In Cairo , 50 students were ordered to change their shirts , prompting flag-waving parents to picket the school board . <p> Rep. Tyrone Brooks ( D-Atlanta ) , who sponsored the flag-change bill , is n't surprised by the spate of Confederate flag flaps . <p> " There is a small segment of the population that will continue to be in opposition and be very vocal and do whatever they can to use the flag issue as a wedge and divisive symbol , " says Brooks , who stands fully behind the new design . " The vast majority of the people of Georgia accept the new flag . " <p> That 's less true , though , the farther from Atlanta one drives . And the discussions over heritage-versus-hate take on particularly mean tones in Donalsonville ( pop . 2,796 ) . <p> At a recent school board meeting , the senior Shingler invited those offended by the Confederate flag T-shirts " to leave the state , " according to the Donalsonville News @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page geared to black readers . ) African-Americans in attendance hooted Shingler down . <p> At a subsequent City Council meeting , the Moores and others demanded Shingler be relieved of his judgeship . They are also upset that Shingler is , in essence , forcing the school board to spend taxpayer money to defend the lawsuit . <p> Seminole Middle/High School , though , bears the brunt of the uneasiness . Clusters of white teachers huddle on one side of a hallway , black teachers on the other . History and Character Education classes become tense when discussions turn to shirts and flags . <p> It almost got ugly in April after a handful of white kids donned their Rebel flag T-shirts while visiting Atlanta . Kenyon White says he kept some black kids from beating up a white kid in the bathroom of the Cyclorama  --  a Civil War musuem . <p> The Confederate flag battle has even reached New York . The CBS Early Show ( with Bryant Gumbel ) is considering a segment . <p> Forgotten , almost , are the students . While most admit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of violence . <p> " I do n't think there 'll be any trouble among students , " says Billy Shingler . " It 'll be mainly among adults . " Seminole Middle/High School in southwest Georgia banned T-shirts with the Confederate flag . In response , the ACLU filed suit last week , decrying the ban as a " restriction on free expression .
