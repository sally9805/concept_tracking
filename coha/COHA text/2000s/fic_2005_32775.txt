U.S.S. TITAN , STARDATE 57137.8 " No ! ! " Deanna Troi bolted upright in bed . For a moment she felt adrift in the dark , in a void whose emptiness chilled her bare flesh . She was n't sure where she was , or even who she was . She felt terrible fear , but did not know why . But then she felt his arms embracing her , bringing her home . Will . Her imzadi . Her husband . Her captain . Her anchor . When he touched her , she was never lost . She relaxed against him , and they stayed that way for a precious moment . Then he spoke softly . " The nightmare again ? " " I 'm not sure , " she said . " The same sense of ... intrusion ... yet different . Not as malevolent . " Talking about the recurring nightmare brought unwelcome flashes of memory . It had been over three months since Shinzon of Remus and his viceroy Vkruk had raped her , using Vkruk 's telepathy to place themselves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although the nightmares came less frequently of late , her memory of the event remained as vivid as ever , and she knew it always would . What made it worse was that it had been her second telepathic sexual assault , the first being at the hands of the Ullian historian Jev nearly a dozen years ago . He too had usurped Will Riker 's place in her perceptions , forcing her to relive an erotic memory which he twisted into a violation . It was a testament to Deanna 's love and faith in Will that she was still able to take joy and comfort from his touch today . Sometimes it took a little work , though . Reliving those memories intensified the fight-or-flight impulse the dream had triggered , and suddenly she felt a desperate need for personal space . She clambered out of bed and moved to the windows , not stopping to don a gown first . Over the past few months , Will had grown accustomed to her occasional need not to be touched , so he did n't follow . " Not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You seemed pretty scared . " Deanna stared out at the stars , gathering her thoughts . " I do n't remember . It was as though ... something else 's fear was being forced into me . " " Something ? Not someone ? " " It felt very alien . Yet ... somehow distantly familiar . " She shook her head , giving a slight , nervous chuckle . " Never mind . It was just a dream . A bit of undigested chocolate . " " You sure of that , Ebenezer ? " She did n't have to turn to see the smirk on his face . " You 've been contacted through dreams before . Eyes in the dark , " he intoned in a spooky voice that made her laugh . " Anything 's possible , I suppose , but there 's too little to go on . " She gazed out at the stars . " Something alien , but familiar ... probably some symbol my brain pieced together , representing anxiety at the unknown . A natural enough response , considering our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission that lay before them , and she shared it even without her empathy . Titan and her crew had been meant for pure exploration , but had been forced to defer that mission when Starfleet had assigned them to head a diplomatic task force to Romulus , assisting with the rebuilding efforts following Shinzon 's bloody coup and subsequent self-destruction . Right afterward , Titan 's aid in the search for a lost Romulan fleet had led to a fall down an extradimensional rabbit hole into the Small Magellanic Cloud , over 200,000 light-years from home . In theory , that had been an explorer 's dream come true , but dealing with the destruction caused by the Red King entity and the rescue of the Neyel from their disintegrating homeworld had left no chance for real exploration . And then it had been back to Starbase 185 for two weeks of repairs and debriefing , and another two weeks and change moving out beyond Federation space , past Beta Stromgren , past Kappa Velorum , and finally , last night , past the farthest benchmark laid by Olympia on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point on , nobody knew what lay ahead . It was not an unusual experience for an explorer , of course , and it was a welcome one ; yet it naturally brought trepidation too , as any new undertaking did . Perhaps that was all there was behind her sense of alien-yet-familiar dread . Maybe it was heightened because from here on , they were completely on their own  --  no real-time contact with Starfleet Command , no starbases to offer rest and replenishment , no other starships able to reach them in a hurry . She had gotten a taste of that during their recent sojourn in the galaxy next door . But in an odd way there was something even more daunting about doing it on purpose . She felt Will 's gentle skepticism , reminding her that she sometimes overanalyzed , an occupational hazard . " Probably , " he said aloud . " But keep a mental eye out , just in case . " Now she did turn to him . " Aye , aye , Captain , " she said with an insouciant salute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thoroughly out of uniform . " Must be cold over by the windows . Wan na come back to bed ? " " No , thanks , " she replied after a moment . Somehow she did n't feel chilled anymore ; it must have been a relic of the dream . " I do n't think I could get back to sleep right away . Maybe I 'll go for a walk to clear my head . " " All right , then . " She sensed the disappointment that he quickly reined in . She knew he regretted that he could n't always be the one to make her feel better , to take care of her . But she also knew he understood how it was for her . Not long before her ordeal with Shinzon , Will had suffered his own ordeal , held hostage and tortured by the dictator Kinchawn of Tezwa . He still had his own occasional nightmares , and though he 'd cherished her comfort and support , still there were times that he needed to deal with them on his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , degraded and depersonalized , it was healthy to reassert one 's independence , to find one 's own inner strength . Deanna went to the closet , slipped on a light blue wrap and a pair of sandals , and headed out the door . She sent a light mental caress Will 's way , only to find that he 'd already drifted off again . Still , his serenity in slumber was a pleasant sendoff . Strolling the corridors of Titan felt somewhat like an exploration in itself . It was still a fairly new environment to her  --  a new class of ship , a new set of crewmates . More importantly , that crew was the most diverse one in Star-fleet 's history , including many species Deanna had never personally met before . The Federation had always striven for diversity in principle , but in practice had tended toward fairly segregated crews . It was n't a formal policy ; people generally just preferred to work among those with similar customs , outlooks , and environmental needs . Even in the absence of outright prejudice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impulse to seek the familiar . So maintaining true equality took conscious effort , and sometimes the effort fell prey to other priorities , or to simple neglect . There had been occasional attempts to challenge that status quo , most notably Wil-lard Decker 's Enterprise experiment of a century before . But reconciling the needs and attitudes of radically different species posed many challenges , and with the loss of Decker on his crew 's maiden voyage , some of the impetus for greater diversity had been lost . The technology for balancing so many species ' environmental and medical needs had been less advanced then as well . So over the ensuing years , things had settled back into a less challenging status quo . Certainly some progress had been made ; during Deanna 's tenure on the Enterprise-D and -E , over a dozen species had been represented among the crew . However , it was still fairly unusual for humanoids and nonhumanoids to crew together routinely . The minds behind Titan 's mission had wanted to change that . This new generation of Luna-class explorer ships  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shift toward more combat-oriented starships  --  had been revived after war 's end , promoted as a reassertion of Starfleet 's core ideals of peaceful exploration and diplomacy . For years , Starfleet had been forced to focus on mere survival , and many of its ideals had needed to be compromised in pursuit of that goal . Some had been compromised without so great a need  --  as Deanna and Will knew better than most , after their experiences on the Ba'ku planet and Tezwa . Many in Starfleet felt it was essential to reaffirm a higher set of values than survival alone , to remind the peoples of the Federation that it was more important to live for something than simply to stay alive . Hence the ambitious new mission of Titan and its eleven sister ships  --  emissaries to the unknown , questing out in all directions , hands extended to friends not yet met . But if these ships were to represent the Federation , it was resolved , then they must represent it in all its diversity . If they stood for peaceful coexistence with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eager coexistence among the Federation 's members . Hence the Great Experiment was spawned , reviving Willard Decker 's dream and going it one better  --  or twelve better . Will Riker had been a natural choice to carry forward that dream  --  even aside from the striking similarity of their names and aspects of their life histories . For as long as Deanna had known him , William Thomas Riker had been a passionate xenophile , not merely tolerant of others ' differences , but positively delighted by them . He took an unabashed , childlike glee in learning about other cultures , sampling their cuisine , their customs , their music , their art  --  and in his bachelor days , their sexual customs as well . ( Which did n't trouble Deanna in the least ; on the contrary , his range of experience in that regard had benefitted her greatly . Though she could n't always say the same about his experiments with alien music or cuisine . ) The chance to captain a crew with so many different species on board , many of which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come true for him . Will had been a gregarious first officer on the Enterprise , popular with his crewmates , organizing poker games , dinner parties , and other crew activities . So far , after a hesitant start and a little prompting from Deanna , he had proven a gregarious captain as well , as fascinated by his crew as by the unknowns that lay outside . It made for high morale among the crew , and Deanna was gratified by that . However , it also gave her a lot of work . Eager to learn about his crewmates ' diversity , and to prove it was an asset to a starship crew , Will had encouraged the expression of cultural idiosyncrasies that a more conservative captain might have discouraged in the name of discipline . To be sure , Titan 's personnel were all professionals , all perfectly capable of self-discipline , and did not use that liberty as an excuse for irresponsible or outrageous behavior . Still , with so many different value systems interacting , some friction was bound to arise . Deanna 's wanderings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall . Glancing inside through the windows inset in the doors , she resisted an urge to recoil at the sight within : the predators were feeding . It was hard enough for the members of a single species to agree on what constituted appealing cuisine and acceptable table manners , let alone the members of multiple species . But this was particularly so when several of those species were obligate carnivores . In the first weeks of Titan 's mission , Dr. Ree , the ship 's dinosaurlike Pahkwa-thanh chief medical officer , had asserted his predatory identity by putting on flamboyant public displays of his rather savage approach to ingesting large , bloody chunks of raw replicated meat ( and sometimes real raw meat , courtesy of the Klingons whose vessels had accompanied Titan on the Romulan mission ) . It was a bold gesture of the kind Deanna would expect from a predator , a forthright assertion : This is what I am , and if you wish to accept me you must adapt to it . It was also typical of the doctor 's cutting sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shocked people for their own edification . And at first it had just been accepted as one person 's eccentricity  --  although Deanna had noticed that many in the crew took careful note of Ree 's routine and sought to schedule their dining at different times . But then the ship 's other predatory crewmembers , including the Caitian lieutenant Rriarr , the Betelgeusian ensign Kuu'iut , the S'ti'ach counselor Huilan , and the Chelon biologist Kekil , had begun to join Ree , making something of a ritual out of it , and a very messy one at that . Among most predatory species it was not only socially acceptable but virtually obligatory to play with one 's food ; not only was there the instinct to play as practice for the real thing , but the metabolism of a hunter was geared toward a period of intense physical activity prior to feeding . ( Back on the Enterprise , Data had discovered that playing with his cat Spot before dinnertime often improved her appetite . Worf , who had inherited Spot after Data 's death , had adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Worf had been reluctant to take the cat at first , since Klingons as a rule were not fond of cute , furry things ; but lately he seemed to have changed his tune . " The cat 's soft appearance is deceptive , " Worf had told her in a recent letter . " Spot is in fact fierce , cunning , uncompromising , and supremely self-assured . What she wants , she demands , or simply takes . She has the heart of a warrior , " he had concluded  --  high praise indeed from him . ) The predators ' dining ritual gave literal meaning to the term " mess hall , " and made many other crew members increasingly uncomfortable  --  particularly those from herbivorous species , some of whom saw it as a deliberate act of intimidation . Huilan himself , one of Deanna 's assistant counselors , had worked out a solution , rearranging shifts so that the predators would have their mealtime at the quietest part of the night shift , and have the mess mostly to themselves . It had alleviated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It seemed too much like the kind of " good fences make good neighbors " policy that this ship and crew were intended to challenge . But there were practical reasons for it , and at least it was an acceptable stopgap until something better came along . Deanna felt she should stop in for a few minutes and say hello  --  watch them eat , maybe even try joining in as Will had once or twice . It was something she 'd have to do if she wanted to overcome her own revulsion at the sight , and come closer to truly connecting with these crewmates of hers . Yet when she saw them tossing bloody chunks of meat and bone at each other , wrestling them into imagined submission and tearing into them with their fangs and beaks and tusks , it was all she could do not to become physically ill . In the wake of her nightmare , the sight seemed to inspire in her a sense of identification with the prey , a visceral urge to flee and hide . Letting out a shudder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait for another time , and briskly strode away . Maybe she was being a bit of a hypocrite , but she was off duty and it was the middle of the night , so that was her prerogative . Besides , she thought , the bloodstains would never come out of this wrap . She wandered the corridors aimlessly for a time , greeting crew members when they went by but not seeking conversation . There were more people out than she was used to seeing on a starship 's " night " shift ; but then , there was a greater range of diurnal cycles represented among the crew . Some species slept only every few standard days ; aquatics like Ensign Lavena slept infrequently , generally with only half the brain asleep at a time ; and several of the predators were adapted for short-burst activity and needed extended sleep periods . It had been a challenge reconciling duty cycles . From around an intersection just ahead , coincidentally enough , Deanna heard the distinctive gurgle of water draining from the entrance lock to Lavena 's water-filled quarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not the Pacifican flight controller , but Dr. Xin Ra-Havreii , Titan 's designer , and now her chief engineer following the death of Nidani Ledrah during the Romulan affair . The Efrosian was wearing a robe and toweling off his long , white , dripping-wet hair and mustache , and Deanna realized he must have been engaged in an affair of another sort . She would have turned away and left him his privacy , but he spotted her and gave a wide , unabashed smile . " Counselor Troi , what a welcome surprise to see you ! " " Doctor , " she replied , keeping her tone casual . " I hope you 'll pardon my appearance . Ensign Lavena and I were having the most intriguing ... discussions . Selkies have such lovely speech , do n't you think ? So musical , so nuanced , much like Efrosian languages . You ca n't truly appreciate it out of the water . " " Yes , so I 've heard . " She was not that surprised to see him emerging from a female crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include the concept of monogamy , and he was an attractive , charismatic individual . She was sure that Lavena was not the first to reciprocate his wide-ranging interest in the ship 's female crew members . But she was gratified that Ra-Havreii had demonstrated a tendency to be discreet about his liaisons ; if she wished to satisfy her curiosity about how an air-breather could engage in sexual relations with the water-breathing ensign , she could always ask Will . ( Well , that was n't quite right ; Lavena had been in the amphibious phase of her life cycle when Will had known her nearly two decades ago . In a sense , Will had been in a different life stage then as well , and today he was more uneasy about the tryst than Deanna was . ) That aspect of Ra-Havreii 's behavior , at least , was not typical of Efrosians ; a people with an extensive oral tradition , they tended not to consider an event fully real until they 'd spoken of it to someone else . Ra-Havreii was evidently willing to accommodate more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though she had no doubt he kept a detailed audio journal of his encounters . But that was not something she wished to dwell on . " Actually I 'm glad I caught you , " she said . " I 'd been hoping we could schedule a talk in the near future . " He spread his hands wide . " I 'm at your disposal , Counselor . If you 'd like to accompany me back to my quarters , then once I get changed I can offer you a drink and we can discuss whatever you like . " " That 's very gracious , Doctor , but I was thinking of a discussion along more formal lines . " Ra-Havreii grimaced , without losing his good humor . " In your office , no doubt . I saw quite enough of counselors ' offices following the Luna incident , thank you . They 're all so calculatedly nonthreatening , so self-conscious in their attempts to put one at ease that they become oppressive . " Ra-Havreii , Deanna knew , had blamed himself for some time after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time she had been concerned that Ledrah 's death from an engine-room explosion would have reignited the doctor 's guilt , but instead he seemed to have handled it constructively , embracing his new post as an opportunity to make amends for his past and move forward with his life . The problem now was that it was n't the only thing he was interested in embracing . " If you wish to discuss my personal life , where better than in my personal abode , where I can truly feel at ease ? " he asked in a reasonable yet jaunty tone . " And where I will do my very best to make you feel equally at ease . " Deanna did n't need her empathy to sense the seductive undercurrent in his words . " Doctor , you know perfectly well that I 'm a married woman . " " A condition which the Betazoids I 've known have been rather flexible about . " " Well , I 'm not one of them . And you 're not fooling me , you know . " " Ahh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I not fooling you about , my dear ? " " Efrosian or not , you know better than to seriously try to seduce the wife of your own very human captain . You 're only trying to distract me . " " Perhaps I 'm only trying to distract myself . Even without serious intent , flirtation with a lovely , intelligent lady is a worthy entertainment in its own right . " " If you say so , " she told him . " But taken to excess , or where it 's unwelcome , it can be disruptive . Lately your flirtations have been growing more frequent , and there have been one or two complaints . From Ensign Panyarachun , for example . She has to work with you every day , and she 's told you more than once that she finds your attentions distracting . " " Ahh , but would she be so distracted by them if she were n't intrigued ? I 've made it clear there 's no pressure on her to respond . I 'm simply ... expressing my admiration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than just her looks . " " And she is ! I find her skills to be exemplary . I would n't be so intrigued with her otherwise . If I only wanted a beautiful face and body , the holodeck is at my disposal . " " Then if you respect her mind , Doctor , you should respect her wishes as well , and keep your relationship strictly professional . " " As you do with the captain ? " At her glare , he said , " I meant no disrespect , dear Counselor  --  I simply have trouble determining where you think the line should be drawn . It 's a strange way of thinking to me . Where I come from , it 's considered somewhat rude not to flirt with someone of your preferred sex . And the concept of a professional relationship being asexual by definition ... well , back home we feel very differently . Sex among colleagues is encouraged ; it 's an excellent way to learn to respect each other 's needs and work together for mutual gain . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surely you 've been in Starfleet long enough to know that . " " Long enough to find that the lines are more ambiguous than is generally claimed . Besides , is n't this ship all about encouraging cultural exchange , getting past the dominance of human ways of doing things ? Who 's to say my way is n't worth trying , hmm ? " he asked with an impish leer . " It seems to work well enough on the command level . " " Maybe your way would be worth trying , if everyone agreed to it . But for now , just leave the ensign alone . " " All right , " he agreed grudgingly , " but I guarantee you she 'll regret it . " He furrowed his snowy brows . " On the other hand , maybe there 's something to be said for playing hard to get . It might get her to chase me . And nobody could object to that , could they ? " He stopped at a doorway , which slid open on his approach . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can end this fascinating discussion on coworker sexual relations , or you can come in so we can explore the issue in greater depth . " " In that case , Doctor , I 'll leave you alone with your thoughts . " He clasped her hand in a gentlemanly manner . " Rest assured , my dear , they will be mainly of you . " She smirked . " So long as they 're about what I said , not what I 'm wearing . " " I daresay clothing will not enter into them at all . " Glaring at him , she extracted her hand from his . " Good night , Doctor , " she said , and strode away . Once she heard the door slide closed behind her , she dropped the stern act and let out a chuckle . She 'd actually found his flirtations rather amusing  --  purely as entertainment for their own sake , as he 'd said  --  but she had n't wished to encourage him . The chuckle turned into a long , massive yawn , and Deanna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will . I think I 'll file this conversation under doctor-patient confidentiality , she said to herself . Will might be very tolerant of cultural differences , but there were limits . And this was supposed to be a quiet , late-night stroll , she thought . Serving on this ship is going to be quite an adventure . Continues ...
