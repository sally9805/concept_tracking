Chapter One Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters . Pride and Prejudice , Chapter 61 On the day Miss Elizabeth Bennet wed Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy , she did not mind dividing with her elder sister , Jane , the notice due a bride . Indeed , she had been delighted when Jane chose to marry Mr. Charles Bingley in a double ceremony . It seemed only right that two sisters and two men who were themselves particular friends should all embark on their new lives together , and she hoped the event presaged many happy hours spent in each other 's company in the years ahead . Elizabeth did mind , however , sharing the stage with Mr. Bingley 's sister Caroline . The new Mrs. Darcy glanced across the drawing room of Longbourn House . Miss Bingley and her fianc , Mr. Frederick Parrish , sat beside each other on the sofa , monopolizing the attention of half the wedding guests . Their immediate spectators included two of Elizabeth 's younger sisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Louisa Hurst . The couple 's chatter had also drawn the observation now her son-in-law , Mrs. Bennet , like many of Darcy 's acquaintances , yet found him a formidable man . Elizabeth observed Miss Bingley listening to Parrish with rapt attention . He cast his fiance a warm smile , then broadened it to include the rest of his party . Monts Joyeux . She searched her rudimentary knowledge of French for a rough translation . Joyful Hills ? The image of a home so named somehow suited the attentive , amiable man . But Miss Bingley was another matter . " I 'm astonished that she consented to marry an American , " she said . " One ca n't imagine her living in the United States . She 'd consider it uncivilized . " " Maybe the size of Mr. Parrish 's inheritance influenced her , " Jane said . " It must be a very grand estate . I understand , however , that he plans to buy another property here in England . " She lowered her voice so that it reached only Elizabeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pemberley at last , Lizzy , now that she knows she 'll never have yours . " Anticipation swept Elizabeth at the mention of Mr. Darcy 's home in Derbyshire-now her home , too . Before Darcy became engaged , Miss Bingley had been obvious in her aspirations to one day cross Pemberley 's threshold as its mistress . Apparently , she 'd experienced more disappointment over failing to secure the estate than its owner , for no sooner had Darcy and Elizabeth set their wedding date than Miss Bingley embarked on a whirlwind courtship with Mr. Parrish . Somehow , in the space of mere weeks , Caroline had managed to win the affections of a very eligible bachelor . Sensing someone 's gaze upon her , Elizabeth raised her eyes to meet those of her new husband . Darcy stood some distance away , enduring the effusive congratulations of Mr. Collins , who had apparently found himself unequal to the effort of holding his own tongue long enough to overhear Mr. Parrish 's words , and had therefore chosen to confer upon one of the bridegrooms his felicitations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clergyman continued his discourse unabated , completely insensible of the interruption in attendance to his soliloquy . Though Darcy had cropped his dark brown hair a little shorter than usual for today , unruly curls yet wisped round his head . Short side-whiskers lent prominence to his strong jaw , while the lapels of his double-breasted coat accented the broad shoulders that so capably bore the weight of many responsibilities . Not of brawny build , he nevertheless exuded puissance , the noble virility of a classical marble bust come to life . He towered over her cousin , his stature enabling her to see every nuance of his countenance . The man who could quell observers with the rise of a single dark brow bestowed upon her a look of infinite tenderness before returning his gaze to Mr. Collins . " Miss Bingley can have every acre of Pemberley , " she said softly . " I have the real fortune . " She glanced once more at her husband . Poor Darcy-stuck in the corner with Mr. Collins , and no end to the interview in sight ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , she headed for it , intending to relieve Darcy 's suffering by interrupting the conversation to offer refreshment . No sooner had she poured coffee to take to the gentlemen , however , than Miss Bingley and Mrs. Hurst approached the table . " I 'm positively parched . " Miss Bingley took one of the cups from Elizabeth 's hands . Mrs. Hurst took the other . " Yes , it is very dry in this room . " Elizabeth forbore suggesting that perhaps Miss Bingley 's thirst derived from having spent the morning talking excessively about herself and Mr. Parrish . Instead , she commented on that safest and most meaningful of all topics-the weather-observing that there had been little rainfall of late . " A providential circumstance for your wedding , " Mrs. Hurst said , " particularly since it was held in the country . Otherwise , you would have risked dragging the hem of your gown through mud on your way into church . " " And what a charming little church-not at all like the large London ones where so many in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so snugly seated . " Miss Bingley 's voice held all of the usual smugness with which she addressed any of the Bennets . " Altogether a nice little affair from beginning to end . Do you not agree , Louisa ? How fortunate you are , Eliza , to have had your mother to guide you in the planning . " Elizabeth ignored the poorly stifled snicker that erupted from Mrs. Hurst . The Bingley sisters had never managed to mask their disdain for her mother , had seldom even tried . In moments of self-honesty , she conceded that their criticism was not without foundation . But their rudeness was . Mrs. Bennet might lack restraint and good judgment , but her silly behavior had at its root the sincere wish of seeing her five daughters securely settled , and maybe even happy . The Bingley sisters , in contrast , had demonstrated by words and deeds that they ultimately had no one 's interests at heart but their own . " Mrs. Bennet must have taken particular pleasure in preparing for today , since she was unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Hurst said . " Yes-how is Mrs. Wickham ? " Miss Bingley asked . " She is well , " Elizabeth responded civilly . In other words , Lydia was still infatuated with the wastrel she 'd married , and therefore as happy as a flighty , thoughtless , self-absorbed girl can be . Though Elizabeth loved her sister , the remembrance of last summer 's scandalous elopement yet pained her , and she felt guilty relief that when Wickham 's previous misconduct toward the Darcy family rendered it impossible to include him on today 's guest list , Lydia had chosen to remain with her husband at his military post in Newcastle rather than attend the nuptials . " Have you any advice for those of us who will soon follow you down the aisle ? " Miss Bingley pressed , casting a conspiratorial smirk at Mrs. Hurst . Louisa leaned forward for Elizabeth 's response . " With your own taste to guide you , I am sure your celebration could derive no further benefit from my opinions . " The Bingley sisters returned to their party , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The American 's distinct accent seemed to entertain its listeners independent of whatever he had to say . Elizabeth poured more coffee and carried it to Darcy and Mr. Collins . " Forgive the interruption , gentlemen , but I thought you might appreciate something to drink . I 've been informed that it 's dry in here . " Darcy 's look of gratitude had nothing to do with the refreshment . " Cousin Elizabeth , your eagerness to serve your new husband does you credit . " Mr. Collins accepted the coffee but could not leave off talking long enough to taste it . " Do allow me to express once more my most heartfelt wishes for your future happiness . Though , as I was just expressing to Mr. Darcy , it grieves me that you entered into the matrimonial state without his aunt 's permission . You will , I am sure , be gladdened to hear that her ladyship still tolerates the mention of your husband 's name in her presence , an omen which leads me to believe that if you applied to Lady Catherine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her rank is entitled , she may in due course yet condescend to approve the match . " " What a relief ! I know not how Mr. Darcy and I will get on until we obtain her approbation . " " Thank goodness you realize the seriousness of the situation . I had feared you were insensible of the grave insult you have paid her ladyship- " " Mr. Collins , " she said as if addressing him in confidence , " I have just come into the knowledge that there is another couple here who could benefit from your insights on marriage . " She directed his attention toward the sofa . " Miss Bingley and Mr. Parrish have just announced their engagement , and only moments ago , the lady was seeking my counsel on planning the ceremony . Certainly you-longer married than I , and a clergyman besides-could offer her valuable instruction . " Mr. Collins nodded enthusiastically . " I could indeed . There is so much a betrothed couple ought to consider- " " And they should consider it all . " " Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " " Why delay ? " Elizabeth asked . " There is an empty seat near Miss Bingley . This is the perfect occasion to share your knowledge . " The clergyman wanted no further encouragement . " You are right , cousin Elizabeth . Wisdom can never be imparted too early . If you and Mr. Darcy will excuse me ? " " Of course . " Mr. Collins hastened to Miss Bingley 's side , eliciting an expression of horror from that lady and a charge of satisfaction from Elizabeth . " I had no idea I married a woman capable of such cruelty to another of her sex . " She met Darcy 's smile . " I merely thought that someone so desirous of attention and someone so generous in extending it should be united in conversation . " " Somehow , I doubt Miss Bingley agrees . " " I can call him back , if you wish . " " Do not dare . " Spotting Charlotte Collins approaching the tea table , she contemplated how much luckier she was than her friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect . Charlotte had gone into her marriage fully sensible of her husband 's oddities , and managed Mr. Collins skillfully , but Elizabeth nevertheless preferred her own definition of happiness . Darcy followed her gaze . " I am glad your friend Mrs. Collins could be here . Have you had much opportunity to visit with her ? " " Very little . I 've been trying to devote a bit of time to each of our guests . As a consequence , I feel I 've spent the morning talking ceaselessly but saying nothing . " " Then you shall fit right in with the haut ton . " She looked up at him , this man with whom she was now joined . " Everyone wants a few minutes with the bride , " she said quietly , " and all I want are a few minutes with you . " " Only a few ? I had counted on a lifetime . " Her mischievous spirit returned . " Did you not realize ? I took you on probation . " " And how have I acquitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Beyond every expectation . Not that there was ever much doubt of my keeping you , but a man willing for my sake alone to bear the conversation of Mr. Collins has no equal . " Their social obligations compelled them to part . Darcy went to the Gardiners , while Elizabeth met Mrs. Collins at the tea table . She embraced her friend , noting immediately her thickened waist . " Charlotte , I must tell you again how pleased I am that you managed to come . " " I would not have missed it . Had Lady Catherine withheld permission for Mr. Collins to attend , I would have urgently wished to visit my mother once more before my confinement , or developed a craving for cream that could be satisfied only by the Lucas Lodge dairy My husband is so nervous about my ' delicate state of health ' that he would not dare refuse me . " As Charlotte tucked a stray lock of hair behind her ear , Elizabeth noted that a few strands of grey had emerged amid the auburn since she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Very , despite her ladyship 's insistence that I behave as an invalid-when I 'm not attending to matters she deems more important , of course . " She poured tea for herself and Charlotte . " I wonder that Mr. Darcy 's aunt spared her clergyman leave to attend a wedding she herself has denounced . " " I suspect she approved our being present so that she could demand an account of all the sordid details upon our return . " " And what will you report ? " " Let 's see ... " She cocked her head , studying Elizabeth with keen blue eyes . " Mrs. Darcy looked radiant in a full dress of Brussels lace over white silk , with a low yet modest neckline , high waist , short sleeves , and a wreath of orange blossoms securing her veil . " Her gaze darted across the room . " Her bridegroom wore a dark blue dress coat , white waistcoat , highly starched cravat , and- " She turned back to Elizabeth . " Really , are gentlemen 's clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ featured eight courses and three wines . And so on . But those are the particulars her ladyship will enquire about . What she wo n't ask , but what I shall endeavor to reveal , is that her nephew appeared as happy as his new bride . " " Despite having ruined his great family with disgraceful connections ? " Elizabeth mocked Lady Catherine 's contemptuous tone . " She will not be pleased at the knowledge . " " I am . I hoped for this event when you visited us last spring , you know . Perhaps in time her ladyship will come to accept you . " " I am told that if I grovel sufficiently , such felicity may be mine . " Charlotte stirred milk into her tea , her expression turning serious . " I shall surely miss your visits otherwise . You must write often , and tell me about your new life . Do you plan a honeymoon trip ? " " Not immediately . Jane and Mr. Bingley have invited us to stay at Netherfield tonight . We 'll depart for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With Christmas approaching , we want simply to get settled at Pemberley before the Gardiners join us three weeks hence . Perhaps we 'll go away in spring . " She lingered long with Charlotte , conscious that circumstances surrounding their respective marriages meant that this could be her last opportunity to see her friend for quite a while . Periodically , laughter and exclamations erupted from Miss Bingley 's party , drawing their gazes in that direction . Elizabeth had expected the assembly to disperse upon Mr. Collins 's arrival , but Mr. Continues ...
