HONORING OUR DO-NOTHING CONGRESS <p> Since Bill Clintons reelection , pundits have spent the better part of his lameduck term mulling his legacy . But less noted has been that of his co-conspirators-the equally lame Republican-controlled Congress that has run the country for the last four years . The 105th and the 106th were supposed to be the full flower of Republican action and vision , the completion of the work begun by the Contract With America . Instead the nation has endured , with the help of listless Democrats , a Do-Nothing Congress that managed to rename National Airport in honor of Ronald Reagan but was left too spent to ever soar to such legislative heights again . <p> Only two years ago , Newt Gingrich was believed to be the most powerful House speaker in history , and an innocent nation was making the acquaintance of Miss Monica Lewinsky . How time flies  --  clips of the impeachment circus are already looking scratchy . Now , with all eyes on the great presidential race , it may be too easy to forget that at the root @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most witless convention of ditherers in our history . <p> The only amazing thing current members of Congress can claim is their own reelection two years ago . In the meantime , wheels have spun , and meaningful legislation-the national tobacco settlement , campaign finance reform , gun control-died in committee . But just because nothing 's been done , does n't mean that nothing happened . There were moments that were weird ( Texas Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee yelled at a staffer who failed to reserve her a limo : " You do n't understand . I am a queen , and I demand to be treated like a queen ! " ) . And on the other hand there were moments that were deeply weird ( while impeaching the president Gingrich was sleeping with a mistress who looks like she was separated at birth from Hillary ) . So , it seems only fitting to honor the more outstanding custodians of our democracy with the same distinction bestowed upon other underachievers whose only talent is self-perpetuation  --  an awards pageant . Open the curtain upon the First Biennial Diddlies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The envelopes , please . The Award for Best Prop in a Congressional Performance <p> Thomas Barrett ( D-Wis . ) , David Obey ( D-Wis. ) , and Ron Kind ( D-Wis . ) : The trio dressed up a staffer as a cow and presented Wisconsin Senator Herb Kohl with boxing gloves to encourage him to " keep up the fight " for dairy subsidies . <p> Dennis Hasterr ( R-Ill . ) : The new House speaker was to have participated in a publicity stunt by standing next to a horse on the Capitol grounds  --  demonstrating that Republicans were " workhorses , " not " show horses . " Hastert canceled , Hill rumor has it , because he 's scared of horses . <p> Billy Tauzin ( R-La . ) : Tauzin , whose district is largely swamp , dressed in George S. Patton helmet and medals to videotape a motivational message for Republicans depressed that Clinton 's popularity continued to rise following the impeachment vote . " Stop your whining ! " General Tauzin barked into the camera . <p> Senator Barbara Boxer ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered for sale , " Boxer Shorts . " <p> J.C . Watts ( R-Okla . ) : Watts joined with other gung-ho Republicans to encourage the dour GOP leadership to try an underused prop : the smile . According to a report in Roll Call , Republicans devoted a secret meeting to discuss this new strategy . " It really will not break your back if you smile around this place , " Watts told the group . On the other hand , Texas Senator Phil Gramm explained to Cokie Roberts one morning why he should n't smile : " I did n't go to the dentist until I was 16 " <p> AND THE WINNER IS : Billy Tauzin . The Louisiana Republican trotted out the Patton garb again this year to spur GOP fundraising efforts . " If you do n't like soft money , if you think it 's dirty , ' Tauzin huffed , " collect it and bring it to us . We know how to use it . " The Billy Carter Award for Most Amusing Political Relative <p> Randall Todd Cunningham : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cunningham ( R-Calif. ) was convicted for possession of 400 pounds of marijuana . In court , the congressman cried and pleaded for mercy , explaining that his son " has a good heart . He works hard . He 's expressed to me he wants to go back to school " While out on bail , the hardworking son tested positive for cocaine use three times ; when an officer tried to apprehend him following the third positive test , Randy hurled himself out a window and broke his leg . Still , the congressman  --  who has denounced Clinton 's " soft-on-crime liberal judges " and railed against " reduced mandatory-minimum sentences for drug trafficking  --  won for his son the mercy denied so many others . Randy got 30 months  --  half the federal " mandatory " minimum sentence . <p> Claude Shelby : The son of Richard " Death Penalty for Drug Kingpins " Shelby ( R-Ala. ) was arrested in Atlanta for possession of 13.8 grams of hash . He was fined a $570 " administrative penalty .

" She 's done little else to glorify her departed 's political legacy : Last November , she freaked out constituents by telling TV Guide that Sonny died because he was a drug addict whose affection for painkillers more than likely clouded his vision the day he went skiing . <p> AND THE WINNER IS : Mary Bono . In between votes , the merry widow has been spotted in the Rayburn Room , just off the House floor , making out with her new flame , drummer Brian Prout of the band Diamond Rio . The Award @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hakuta : On the eve of the Judiciary Committee vote to impeach , the founder of AllHerb.com FedExed members of Congress a sampling of Horny Goat Weed .

You make me sick . You need to be shot . You need to be executed . " Devine left his name and phone number on the machine . <p> AND THE WINNER IS : Dennis Hopper . He also pledged to the former speaker , " When you want to run for president , I will be there . " The Rank Hypocrisy Award <p> The Entire Republican Party : The GOP , which popularized the English First movement , announced that it would broadcast its weekly radio address in Spanish .

How great you are with your children . " A handout at the event reminded attendees : " Many Mexicans joined the U.S. armed forces after Pearl Harbor in gratitude .

The CCC 's members understandably thought of Lott as one of their own : His dues were regularly paid ; their leadership had been entertained in Lott 's Capitol office ; a column by the senator had been published in their newsletter ; and the CCC happily distributed a photograph of Lott speaking before its members . As for knowing their " agenda " even the dimmest Mississippian would get the pun : CCC , KKK . <p> AND THE WINNER IS : Trent Lott . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senators in a vote to condemn Nation of Islam spokesman Khallid Muhammad for calling the pope a " cracker .

" The Award for Best Election Story <p> Mike Pappas ( R-N.J . ) : In July 1998 , Pappas went onto the House floor and sang , without irony , the following lullaby : TABLE <p> He lost . <p> Mark Neumann : In order to ridicule Senator Feingold 's support of a study of methane gas emissions , his Republican challenger ran an advertisement featuring a scientist in a lab coat and rubber boots running behind cows with ajar . The voice-over noted , " This scientist is hard at work spending your tax dollars . " He lost . <p> Rick Hill ( R-Mont . ) : Hill trashed his childless opponent Nancy Keenan for not being as family-values oriented as himself , a father . Keenan had been forced to undergo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chenoweth-Hage ( R-Idaho ) : The rightwinger , whose concern for biodiversity is best summed up by her claim that " white Anglo-Saxon males are an endangered species , " was supported by an unlikely coalition of Idaho greens in her reelection campaign against an environmentally shaky Democrat . Why ? In the words of Ron Mitchell of the Idaho Sporting Congress , " Chenoweth poses no danger because she is incompetent and has no credibility with her peers in Congress . " Chenoweth-Hage , who prefers being called a congressman , won . <p> AND THE WINNER IS : Mike Pappas , whose opponent 's highly successful 1998 campaign against him consisted almost exclusively of running the audio of Pappas ' congressional concert on the radio .

Cunningham later apologized with an excuse that breathes fresh meaning into the term non sequitur : " I just get upset when people start bashing our military " <p> Merrill Cook ( R-Utah ) : One of Utah 's trio of representatives derisively known as the Three Stooges , and the millionaire owner of a dynamite company , Cook was enraged that a party ad had neglected to mention him and exploded at the state 's GOP leadership : " Fuck the Republican Party !
