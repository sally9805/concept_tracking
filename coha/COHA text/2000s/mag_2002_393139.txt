Compass bearings // To the child , the savage and the Wall Street operator everything seems possible , hence their credulity . - Eric Hoffer Ever since the Enron Corporation disappeared early last winter in a cloud of shredded paper , the promoters of the faith in fairy gold have been staging a diligent search for the fabulous instrument known to President George W. Bush and the editors of the Wall Street Journal as America 's lost " ethical compass . " Although nobody could say for certain what the thing looks like , or whether it was first seen aboard the U.S.S. Constitution in the spring of 1812 or somewhere on the field at Gettysburg in the summer of 1863 , everybody knew that it was very precious and very old , that it points corrupt accountants in the direction of the nearest church , leads irresponsible corporate executives away from the temptation of low-cost stock options , guides the United States Air Force to noncivilian targets in Central Asia . The first search parties that set forth in late January were small and not yet desperate ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the equity markets , three or four elderly economists consulting maps and the notebooks of John Maynard Keynes ) ; by the last week in July the Dow Jones industrial average was down 2,300 points , and what had begun as a tentative exploration had become a massive Easter egg hunt joined by several thousand volunteers-politicians armed with subpoenas , lawyers bearing lanterns , eminent historians quoting the aphorisms of Ronald Reagan , a rabble of television cameramen and FBI agents struggling with dogs . The gathering of so large a host spoke to the increasingly forlorn hope of finding the financial equivalent of true north , also to the even more pressing need to preserve the belief that God wants every good American to become as rich as Bill and Melinda Gates . The Enron bankruptcy had been followed by the demolition of Arthur Andersen and the wreck of Global Crossing , and for the next six months every day 's dawn brought word of something else gone rotten in one or another of the country 's corporate boardrooms , the loss of shareholder assets indicating levels of fraud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a desolate set of numbers : // The numbers supplied the bleak outline of the story ; the tabloid press filled out the narrative with lurid anecdote  --  swinish executives paying themselves salaries of $150 million a year as a reward for destroying the business and watering the company stock ; Merrill Lynch fined $100 million for milking its customers with self-serving lies ; crooked auditors setting up dummy corporations as hollow as Hollywood movie sets ; countless employees discarded as carelessly as gum wrappers , robbed of their savings and their pensions ; the Xerox Corporation padding its revenues by the comfortable margin of $2 billion , countless investors shorn like sheep or peeled like grapes . Sure that the missing compass was there somewhere , carelessly misplaced by a clerk in Alan Greenspan 's office or temporarily on loan from the Library of Congress , the search parties in the months of April and May chased down leads in cyberspace , convened congressional investigative committees , sent scouts to make discreet inquiries of the offshore tax havens in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands . More than once they came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they lowered floodlights , called in the ambulances , hugged one another with shouts and tears of joy . Their despair was awful to behold when , on opening the bank vault or turning over the rock , out crawled a grinning Martha Stewart or a wet  --  nosed L. Dennis Kozlowski with a golf ball in his mouth . No more than a year had passed since the nation 's business leaders had been seen as godlike figures descending from corporate helicopters as if from Mt . Olympus , but the long season of heavy rain in Wall Street had changed a good many princes back into frogs . The editors at Fortune and Business Week preferred the term " bad apples " ( a few of which must be expected to fall from even the healthiest of trees ) ; if a collapsed stock price could n't be attributed to thievery or fraud , the magazines depicted the chief executive officer as a well-meaning but bewildered fool , helpless in the hands of charlatans ( invariably younger men , arrogant and cruel ) who mystified the old gent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian girls whose language he did n't understand . The sudden turning of once gilt-edged names to mud ( among them Kenneth Lay , A. Alfred Taubman , and Gary Winnick ) followed from the recognition that folly is easier to excuse than crime and supported the theory developed nearly fifty years ago by the economist John Kenneth Galbraith to account for the stock market crash of 1929 . Bubbles float and bubbles burst , said Galbraith , and in both good times and bad American corporations hold " an inventory of undiscovered embezzlement . . . it should perhaps be called the bezzle . " When money is plentiful and cheap , the Bezzle grows ; when " money is watched with a narrow , suspicious eye , " commercial morality improves , and " the Bezzle shrinks . " The Wall Street Journal endorsed the explanation ; so did the Business Roundtable , the banking committees of Congress , and every retail broker licensed to sell raffle tickets on the New York Stock Exchange . Why yes , of course , the Bezzle-the Bezzle , a few bad apples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman 's office practicing his putting stroke ; join these unfortunate circumstances with the occasional run of plain bad luck , and we have the answer , all too human and perfectly understandable , for the otherwise inexplicable loss of moral direction . Which is where the quest for the fabled compass might have been abandoned had it not been for the simple error in arithmetic reported on June 25 by the management of WorldCom , Inc . The company accountants somehow had confused earnings with operating expenses , with the result that its balance sheets over the last two years attested to the presence of nonexistent revenues in the amount of $3.8 billion . The chief executive officer did n't fail to issue the customary expression of complete surprise , but the stock market reacted poorly ( off 200 points in the next twenty-four hours ) , and the childish simplicity of the scam ( no mail drop in Switzerland , no complex maze of fictional transaction ; not even a holiday distribution of bribes to government officials in Washington or Jackson , Mississippi ) compounded the injury of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of capitalist philosophy discerned symptoms of popular mistrust possibly dangerous not only to the body but also to the spirit of the national economy ; they warned of " a deadly threat to public confidence " and observed that " it was not enough to trust to the innate honesty of the brokerage community . " Senators both Republican and Democratic rushed to the microphones on Capitol Hill to insist that " people go to jail . " Paul Volcker , former chairman of the Federal Reserve , appeared on C-SPAN 's Washington Journal and ABC 's Nightline to say that the country 's economic engine needs clean filters ; Paul O'Neill , the secretary of the treasury , advocated the public hanging of criminal chief financial officers " from the very highest branches " ; Henry A. McKinnell , vicechairman of the Business Roundtable , cautioned against the making of foolish generalizations on the evidence of " eight or ten companies who allegedly behaved in ways that are incomprehensible ... and deserve what they 're getting . " The dean of a business school in Maryland informed the cameras from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearby prisons , there to hear the confessions of businessmen doing time on various counts of racketeering-to hear their confessions , learn from their mistakes , take heart from their acts of penance and contrition . The fanfare of indignant outrage and the chorus of bland reassurance served as overture to President Bush 's coming to the wicked city of New York on July 9 to make the crooked straight and the rough places plain . Before a crowd of wealthy pharisees assembled in the ballroom of the Regent Wall Street Hotel , the President dressed up his remarks in the language of a sermon and placed a wreath of platitudes at the golden feet of Mammon . " The business pages of American newspapers should not read like a scandal sheet , " he said ; the time had come to " usher in a new era of integrity in corporate America , " to " end the days of cooking the books , shading the truth , " to know and remember that " there 's no capitalism without conscience ; there is no wealth without character . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner similar to that of a television evangelist recalling the faithful to the paths of righteousness . Together with threats of punishment ( " the full weight of the law " deployed to " expose and root out corruption , " longer jail sentences for wayward executives , the Securities and Exchange Commission to be equipped with a strike force comparable to a police department SWAT team , etc. ) he distributed uplifting thoughts and earnest exhortations : Corporate America must learn to distinguish between " ambition and destructive greed , " to inspire trust and promote transparency , to show God and Paul Volcker that markets " can be both dynamic and honest . " " Our schools of business must be principled teachers of right and wrong and not surrender to moral confusion and relativism . " Good corporate citizens must " set a moral tone by showing their disapproval " of bad corporate citizens . Careful not to mention any names , either of individuals or corporations , the President spoke for nearly half an hour , and for the first twenty minutes it was possible to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to the Washington Monument , the words meant to be appreciated as ceremonial salutes fired from a battery of Civil War cannons . They drifted across the podium like puffs of smoke , and to try to invest them with meaning was to be asked to believe that Mr. Bush knows nothing about the history of the United States , the temperament of the American people , the workings of capitalism , or the sources of his own fortune . How else does the federal government compose its budget if not by " cooking the books " ; by what means other than " shading the truth " does anybody sell a car , a parcel of real estate , or a politician ? Begin the story of America 's triumphs with Thomas Jefferson 's dictum that " money , not morality , is the principle of commercial nations " and where in the record of the last 200 years do we find much evidence to refute the proposition ? In the gallery of national heroes who stands higher in the hearts and minds of their countrymen than the grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earliest fur traders selling liquor to the Indians , to the land speculators moving west in the 1840s with the hope that they could " get in , get rich , and get out , " to the late nineteenth-century Wall Street financiers ( among them John D. Rockefeller , Cornelius Vanderbilt , and J. P. Morgan ) of whom it was said , usually with envy and admiration , " When they speak they lie , and when they are silent , they are stealing . " How else did Mr. Bush acquire both a baseball team and the office of the presidency if not as gifts from self-interested corporate executives unable to detect a significant difference between " ambition and destructive greed " ? If not with the promise of " something for nothing , " who would know how to monetize the great truth that every true American is entitled to everything he or she can get away with ? What was impressive about the President 's speech was the way in which he managed to sustain the tone of disappointment and surprise ( " We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the making and now coming to light . ... We 've learned of CEOs earning tens of millions of dollars in bonuses just before their companies go bankrupt ... , " etc. ) ; before he reached his peroration I understood that he had adopted the familiar persona of the idiot CEO-the President of the United States revealed as just another good-natured , holy fool , a block of polished wood at the head of the boardroom table , helpless in the hands of charlatans ( irresponsible and un-American ) who mystified the SEC with numbers that not even Vice President Dick Cheney could understand . The line of argument did n't inspire confidence among the bond brokers in the ballroom , but neither did it evoke laughter , and it was not without its uses or its merits . Who else but such a president , as guileless as the unicorn and as innocent as Forrest Gump , could have retrieved the fabled ethical compass from the swamps of moral confusion and the wilderness of debt ? And where , pray tell , did he stumble upon the precious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in vain ? Why , nowhere else but in the breasts of " the leaders in this room . " It had been there all along , hidden in their compensation packages , and if only they would take the trouble to read the small print , they would know that the nation respects them not for their wealth but for their integrity , and that they had it in their power " to restore the people 's trust in American business . " Wonderful and important news , of course , but the stock market was slow to grasp its significance , and it arrived too late to rescue the mathematicians at WorldCom from the pit of relativism . The Dow Jones industrial average dropped another 1,500 points during the ten trading days subsequent to the President 's speech , and on July 21 WorldCom declared a $107 billion bankruptcy , the largest number ever posted on the leader board of American entrepreneurship . Fortunately for the health of the republic , the responsible corporate executives who heard the speech recognized the long-term benefits certain to accrue from the safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive officer of a supermarket chain in Idaho , spoke for the grateful majority of his peers when he told the New York Times that Mr. Bush " hit the nail on the head .... He stood up as CEO of this country and said the whole issue of integrity needs to be higher on the scale of awareness . " Equally relieved to know that what was lost had now been found , the editors of the Wall Street Journal were quick to point out that American businessmen , having regained the instrument of moral navigation , once again were capable of regulating themselves , without the interference of Washington politicians determined to sap the energy of the free-enterprise system by writing ignorant and restrictive laws . But in all the happy throng rejoicing in the President 's discovery , the happiest of all were the generals at the Pentagon planning the invasion of Iraq . It 's no good going to war without an ethical compass . The Navy shells the wrong beaches , the Army does n't know which Arabs to shoot , the Air Force bombs targets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
