Nana always said the Lord works in mysterious ways . Every time she would say that , I would think of Darrell Foskey . If it had n't been for Darrell , I do n't know where I might 've ended up . Probably tossed around in a system of Foster homes just like the clothes did in the dryer the night we first met Darrell . He came into our lives thanks to a jammed quarter at the Laundromat . As the night manager , Darrell saved the quarter and won my mama 's heart all at the same time . I was eight that summer day in 1971 when he moved to the apartment with us . The window air conditioner made a rattling sound as it fought the heat that Darrell let through the door . He put down a water-stained box filled with records long enough to snatch the G.I. Joe figure from my hands . The smell of his soured tongue rolled over me the same way he rolled G.I. Joe 's head between his fingers . " Boy , what you doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when he smiled I saw the chipped tooth that he claimed was a sign of toughness . " Hey , just kidding , big guy . " When Darrell flung the action figure , I jumped to avoid being hit by G.I. Joe . Little did I know then how I 'd keep on jumping to avoid Darrell . Mama was as shocked as I was seven weeks later when Darrell quit his job at the Laundromat and announced he was taking us out for supper . " Daddy , that 's what I love about you . You just go with the gut , " Mama said . She nibbled his ear and talked in that baby way I hated . " That man said he 'll be at JC 's party tonight with a new stash . Let 's go on down there , Daddy . " They did n't see me roll my eyes big as Dallas right in front of them . He sure was n't her daddy , and I 'd throw up before I was fixing to call him any such thing . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my room , I heard Mama giggle . " Boy , go on in there and get ready , " Darrell yelled . " You gon na get yourself a steak dinner tonight . " Darrell was still going on about Canada and all the good jobs he could get working the pipelines . The pretty waitress reappeared and put another drink before him . Although I could n't bring myself to look her directly in the eye , I liked the way she smiled and winked at me . Darrell licked the juice remaining on the steak knife and washed it down with a loud smack . More than usual I was nervous around Darrell tonight . Not so much because of his erratic behavior  --  I was getting used to the outbursts . But the restaurant was too much . Casting my eyes across the room , I watched a group of women Nana 's age laugh while one of them opened brightly wrapped gifts . I could n't help wondering how they would take Darrell if he got on one of his " spells , " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darrell consumed , the more he bragged about all the gold he could find in Canada . " There 's an ol ' boy who used to work with me already up there . They tell me he 's making fifteen dollars an hour on that pipeline . " Darrell licked the excess from the A-1 bottle top and slammed it on the table . I flinched and looked over at the ladies , who were so caught up admiring a gift of crocheted dinner mats that they did n't notice . The pretty waitress appeared again and poured tea into my glass . " Boy , you best leave off the tea and go to studying your plate , " Darrell said with a point of his knife . The waitress glanced at Darrell and then smiled back at me . " Go on , Brandon , and eat your steak now , " Mama said . She lit a cigarette and gazed across the restaurant . " Do n't start no problems . " Picking at the slab of meat surrounded by pink juice , I rested my case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined and ordered steak for all of us . " I 'm not very hungry . " " I 'm not very hungry , " Darrell whined and squinched up his ruddy face . " What 's the matter , this place ai n't good enough for you ? Not good enough for the little king ? " I stiffened my back and dug my nails into the vinyl seat . Trying to gauge how to respond , I looked at Mama , but she was staring at her reflection in the tinted window and flicking the ends of her newly blonde hair . " Just eat the steak , Brandon . " " We ai n't leaving until you eat ever bit of that steak , you hear me . " Elbows planted on the plastic red-and-white tablecloth , Darrell enforced his message with another point of the knife . " It 's got icky stuff coming out of it . " I followed the tip of the knife up to the brown eyes . It was that look . The same vengeful stare that Mama excused as the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Justice of the Peace plus the four she had let in without signed papers . The same dark side that made Darrell throw plates , punch holes in our apartment wall , and kick in my bedroom door . Mama blew cigarette smoke at the plastic gold lamp dangling above the table . " Brandon , just do n't , okay . " Darrell threw his napkin on the plate and steak juice stained the once white material . " Most kids 'd be happy to eat at a nice restaurant , but no , not you . Not the king . You little no good piece of ... " " Oh , Daddy , do n't . Do n't get all riled up . Not tonight . He 's just being a kid . " Mama leaned into Darrell and whined , " Come on , shug ...
