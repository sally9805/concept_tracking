<p> OF all the reasons to visit my friends with small children , grilled cheese sandwiches may be the best . <p> Sure , I treasure the toddler rituals of dumping everything out of Aunty Melissa 's purse , watching out the window for passing trucks ( " Look ! Elliot ! Garbage truck ! " ) , and playing dress up and hide-and-go-seek . But just as much , I love lunchtime , when almost every mother I know asks , " Who wants grilled cheese ? " The loudest voice in the yes chorus is unfailingly mine . <p> Most childless grown-ups I know do n't bother making grilled cheese at home . They tend not to have the requisite ingredients ( American singles , white bread ) in the fridge . And is n't grilled cheese , along with tuna melts , turkey clubs and breakfast specials , why they invented diners ? <p> But after a fun-filled but grilled-cheese-less visit to a friend 's house , during which her exceptional twin 21/2-year-olds happily consumed garlic-sauteed broccoli , I realized I felt deprived  --  even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprinkles . <p> It occurred to me that I do n't necessarily have to procreate or make play dates as an excuse to eat grilled cheese . Why not just make it at home for myself ? Since the only finicky palate to appease is my own , I would n't be tied to yellow cheese and white bread . And really , would n't grilled cheese be just as good or even better when made with slightly more sophisticated , grown-up ingredients , like stinky cheese and grainy bread ? <p> So I started experimenting , keeping the basic technique of frying the sandwich in copious quantities of butter so that the exterior surface of the bread gets crisp and lacy and brittle , while inside the cheese melts into lava , gluing the two slices . <p> I dug out the very best cheese I had , a nutty and intense aged raw milk Comte from the Essex Street Cheese Company . It was certainly flavorful enough to use on its own between slices of whole-wheat bread . But since I was aiming for something super-grown-up , I decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bread with a light smear of a mustard-cornichon dressing . It was enough to cut the richness of the butter , but not obscure the earthy nuances of the cheese . <p> The result  --  crunchy , buttery , tangy and tantalizingly complex  --  immediately made up for that broccoli-laden lunch . <p> When the grilled cheese craving struck a week later , I was passing by my local bagel shop . I thought of a bagel and cream cheese and wondered if I could fry it like grilled cheese . But no , cream cheese does n't have the gooeyness factor of aged cheese , and would simply ooze out in the pan . Bagels and cream cheese made me think about lox , and lox brought to mind Barney Greengrass , a store on Amsterdam Avenue that has the most amazing horseradish Cheddar spread . How would that be on a toasted bagel ? <p> The bagel shop did n't have the spread , but it did have actual horseradish Cheddar . So I bought some with my poppy seed bagel . <p> Waiting for the bagel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered an old friend who would fry her salami before making it into a sandwich . And why not ? I fried a few slices and added them to my cheesy bagel along with rounds of red onion for cool crunch . Spicy , rich and fatty with a meaty edge from the salami , it was definitely as good as regular grilled cheese and nearly as good as bagels and lox . <p> The next time I thought about grilled cheese , it was again because of a visit with friends and their children . But this time , they were coming over and I was cooking . Was there a grilled cheese variation that would not only please both the children and adults , but also pair well with cocktails ? <p> The answer was quesadillas . These soft tortillas filled with mild cheese , then broiled until crisp and molten-centered , were gobbled up by the younger guests . On the side , I served a bracing papaya and avocado salsa for grown-up dunking . Everyone was delighted . <p> And now there 's a grilled cheese sandwich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GRILLED CHEESE WITH CORNICHON SPREADTime : 10 minutes2 tablespoons whole grain mustard2 tablespoons mayonnaise2 tablespoons finely chopped cornichons or other pickles4 slices whole-grain bread1/4 pound Comte cheese , sliced2 tablespoons unsalted butter.1 .
