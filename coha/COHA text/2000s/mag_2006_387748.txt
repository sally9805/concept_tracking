Dear Dr. Cory : I have a problem with my weight . I am 48 inches tall , weigh 100 pounds , and I am eleven years old . I 'm also a very picky eater , and I spend a lot of time watching TV and play video games . Do you have any suggestions on how to change my habits to have a healthier lifestyle ? Ashley Chicago , Illinois Dear Ashley : Here are some ideas to try . Remember , the amount of calories you take in should balance with the amount of energy that you use . 1 Fast walk , swim , dance , skate , or ride a bike for twenty minutes each day for a week . After a week , increase your activity amount to thirty minutes each day ... then forty ... and by the end of the month you will be up to an hour each day . 2 Join a club sport ... they often include all levels of athletes and allow you to ease into the sport while helping you to increase your activity goals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( cereals , brown rice ) and low-fat dairy foods that you like . Then list what you have been eating each day and choose what healthy foods you will substitute for the less-healthy foods . Start out small ... choose an apple , orange , or low-fat yogurt for your after-school snack instead of a cookie . 4 Talk with your parents about planning the family meals and discuss what fruits or vegetables that you would like to add to the menu . Help with the family grocery shopping so that you can help choose healthy foods . Choose at least one fruit with each meal and a vegetable , such as carrot sticks , with lunch and dinner . 5 Take a cooking class so that you can learn to prepare food the way that you like it . Schools , hospitals , or community centers often offer such classes . They are fun and you can learn a lot about nutrition at the same time . 6 Finally , ask your parents if you can sit down with your doctor , dietitian , or other healthcare provider to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They will help to encourage you and keep you on track . Dear Dr. Cory : My eyes have gotten worse during the school year of 2006 . I do n't know what 's wrong . Whenever I try to see the board , I have to squint , and I 'm not even that far from the board . I really do n't want to get glasses , but in order not to get glasses ... my eyes have to get better . Some people tell me that eating fish eyeballs makes your eyes clearer . Are there other options ? Almost Blind Queens , New York Dear Reader , We are not aware of any research showing that fish eyeballs help with this type of vision problem . However , fruits , vegetables , and whole grains are rich in vitamins , minerals , and other nutrients that help keep eyes healthy . And , omega-3 fats found in fish , such as salmon , as well as flaxseeds and walnuts may protect the eyes from age-related macular degeneration-the leading cause of blindness in older people . Children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision problem called myopia , or nearsightedness . It is often an inherited condition . One of your parents may have had this problem around the same age . With myopia , the shape of the eyeball is too long , making it hard to focus on distant objects . Glasses are usually recommended to treat this vision problem . Contact lenses may also be an option , but they require more care . Whether they are right for you is something to discuss with your parents and your eye doctor . Healthy eye tip : Smoking or being around smoky rooms is harmful to the eyes ... another good reason for people to never start smoking and to avoid second-hand smoke . See you next issue !
