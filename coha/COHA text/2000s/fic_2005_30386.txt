All the Flowers Are Dying LP Chapter One When I got there , Joe Durkin was already holding down a corner table and working on a drink  --  vodka on the rocks , from the looks of it . I took in the room and listened to the hum of conversation at the bar , and I guess some of what I was feeling must have found its way to my face , because the first thing Joe asked me was if I was all right . I said I was fine , and why ? " Because you look like you saw a ghost , " he said . " Be funny if I did n't , " I said . " The room is full of them . " " A little new for ghosts , is n't it ? How long have they been open , two years ? " " Closer to three . " " Time flies , " he said , " whether you 're having fun or not . Jake 's Place , whoever Jake is . You got a history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is . I had a history with the place before it was his . " " Jimmy Armstrong 's . " " That 's right . " " He died , did n't he ? Was that before or after 9/11 ? " That 's our watershed ; everything in our lives is before or after that date . " After , " I said , " by five or six months . He left the place to a nephew , who tried running it for a few months and then decided it was n't the life he wanted for himself . So I guess he sold it to Jake , whoever Jake is . " " Whoever Jake is , " he said , " he puts a good meal on the table . You know what they 've got here ? You can get an Irish breakfast all day long . " " What 's that , a cigarette and a six-pack ? " " Very funny . You must know what an Irish breakfast is , a sophisticated guy like yourself . " I nodded . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eggs and sausage . " " And grilled tomato . " " Ah , health food . " " And black pudding , " he said , " which is hard to find . You know what you want ? Because I 'll have the Irish breakfast . " I told the waitress I 'd have the same , and a cup of coffee . Joe said one vodka was enough , but she could bring him a beer . Something Irish , to go with the breakfast , but not Guinness . She suggested a Harp , and he said that would be fine . I 've known Joe for twenty years , though I do n't know that ours is an intimate friendship . He 's spent those years as a detective at Midtown North , working out of the old stationhouse on West Fifty-fourth Street , and we 'd developed a working relationship over time . I went to him for favors , and returned them , sometimes in cash , sometimes in kind . Now and then he steered a client my way . There were times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a career criminal never sat well with him , while his attitude after one vodka too many did n't make me relish his company . But we 'd been around long enough to know how to make it work , overlooking what we did n't like to look at and staying close but not too close . Around the time our food arrived , he told me he 'd put in his papers . I said he 'd been threatening to do so for years , and he said he 'd had everything filled out and ready to go a few years ago , and then the towers came down . " That was no time to retire , " he said . " Although guys did , and how could you blame ' em ? They lost their heart for the job . Me , I 'd already lost my heart for it . Shoveling shit against the tide , all we ever do . Right then , though , I managed to convince myself I was needed . " " I can imagine . " " So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did anything useful in those three years I ca n't remember what it was . Anyway , I 'm done . Today 's what , Wednesday ? A week from Friday 's my last day . So all I have to do now is figure out what the hell to do with the rest of my life . " Which was why he 'd asked me to meet him for dinner , in a room full of ghosts . It had been over thirty years since I put in my papers and retired from the NYPD , and shortly thereafter I 'd retired as well from my role as husband and father , and moved from a comfortable suburban house in Syosset to a monastic little room at the Hotel Northwestern . I did n't spend much time in that room ; Jimmy Armstrong 's saloon , around the corner on Ninth between Fifty-seventh and Fifty-eighth , served as a combination of living room and office for me . I met clients there , I ate meals there , and what social life I had was centered there . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because that 's what I did back then . I kept it up for as long as I could . Then I put the plug in the jug , as the old-timers say , and began spending my idle hours not at Jimmy 's joint but two blocks north of there , in the basement of St. Paul the Apostle . And in other church basements and storefronts , where I looked for something to put in the empty places alcohol used to fill . Somewhere along the way , Jimmy lost his lease and moved half a block south and a long block west , to the corner of Fifty-seventh and Tenth . I 'd kept my distance from the old place after I sobered up , and I avoided the new one for a while as well . It never did become a hangout , but Elaine and I would drop in for a meal from time to time . Jimmy always served good food , and the kitchen stayed open late , which made it a good choice after an evening at the theater or Lincoln Center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funeral parlor on West Forty-fourth , where someone played a favorite song of his . It was " Last Call , " by Dave Van Ronk , and I 'd first heard it when Billie Keegan played it for me after a long night of whiskey ...
