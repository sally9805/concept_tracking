Unbecoming Behavior By Stephanie Rowe Dorchester Publishing Stephanie Rowe What in the world was a total hottie doing sitting in the office next to mine ? I barely caught a glimpse of dark hair and some broad shoulders as I walked by . Too obvious to walk back by and take another look ? Probably . It was a law firm after all . Must always be circumspect . Too bad being lawyerly and dignified was n't my best attribute . Probably a good thing I was n't actually a lawyer , huh ? Much to my parent 's dismay . But hey , I was twenty-four . Hardly had to be living out my parents ' dreams now , did I ? Especially since I 'd promised myself that I 'd be living my own dreams by the time I was twenty-five , which left me less than two months to figure it out and accomplish it . At least I 'd finally broken up with Max . That was a start . " Morning , Isabel . " I nodded at my secretary as I walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would know . " Who 's my next-door neighbor ? Office was empty when I left on Friday . " Isabel looked a little frazzled , even for a Monday morning at seven-thirty . " Blaine Hampton . New partner they hired from outside . " " Partner ? " He 'd looked way young to be a partner . " Already ? " " Comes from money , " she whispered . " Lots of connections . Ah , excellent . Just my parents ' type . Perhaps I should cozy up to him and make him my newboyfriend . Would n't that do a lot to get me back in the McCormick family good graces ? Had n't been there since I dumped my ex , who they all thought was my ticket to respectability . " Bad news , " Isabel continued . " Your event on Friday night ? Cancelled . Place had a fire on Saturday night . " " Cancelled ? " I felt my heart start to do weird little palpitations , as it always did when I felt an encounter with the firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an event for Friday ? " The culmination of the first week of the summer interns . Always a huge event . Cancelled ? Visions of tearing out my hair and racing through the halls screaming and hurling things at random people popped into my head , but I immediately dismissed the idea as dangerously close to that " unbecoming behavior " standard the firm was always using to justify firing people . It was a nice , vague term , infinitely useful for tweaking to fit any situation the firm did n't think was up to par . Seeing as how I was but a lowly social director , I did n't bring enough value to the firm to be able to get away with any unbecoming behavior . So instead of freaking out , I smiled and said , " Can you make some calls and see if you can find another venue ? " Excellent , Shannon . Way to keep your voice calm . See ? I could be a lawyer . Totally able to handle stress . " Ahem . " Ahem ? Who ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing behind me . Early thirties at most . Kick ass blue eyes . And to think I complained regularly about working in a law firm . I took it all back . " I 'm Shannon McCormick . Your next-door neighbor . " He looked at me blankly . Okay , so he was a literal guy . He 'd never get my oh-so-witty sense of humor . So , I pointed to my office . " My office is next to yours . " " Oh . I 'm Blaine Hampton . " " Nice to meet you . " When I shook his hand , I actually felt my stomach do this little somersault . Blaine was totally hot . Terrible name , but very hot guy . " Isabel is your secretary ? " he asked . " Yep . " " How much of her time do you usually take ? " Did n't like the attitude behind that question . Defenses : armed . " As much as I need . " Smokin ' -hot-next-door-neighbor pursed his magnificent lips . " Well , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will require pretty much all of her time . Can you try to limit your use of her ? " My mouth gaped open before I could stop it . " What ? " " My deal . I need Isabel . " I glanced at Isabel , who shrugged apologetically . " You two are my split . " Blaine turned to go back in his office , not even waiting for answer . Yeah , right . Just because I did n't have a law school degree on my office wall did n't mean I was some unworthy pond scum . " Excuse me ? Blaine ? " He paused in his doorway . " Yes ? " " I have a lot going on this week . I run the intern program , and they arrive in a half-hour . My event for Friday night got cancelled , and I need Isabel 's help to make all the arrangements for everything else this week . It 's not like I can just not have these things done . " My parents might think lawyers were better than social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let some partner walk all over me , even if he was drool-worthy . He lifted an eyebrow . " You 're welcome to take it up with Otto , but somehow I think he 'll opine that a six billion-dollar merger is more important than your interns ' lunch plans . That 's why I have you as my split . Because my work can take precedence . " Was he kidding ? The **57;1321;TOOLONG wanted me to take it up with Otto Nelson ? The managing partner . Seventy-three , totally old school , believed it was a lawyer 's prerogative to be an ass to every single person who worked with him , from junior partners all the way down to secretaries . He scared the crap out of everyone . Including me . Oh , except , apparently Blaine , who had somehow gotten Otto his side . With Otto in his corner , Blaine could indulge in all the unbecoming behavior he wanted and he 'd never be held accountable . Jerk . Blaine flashed me a dimpled smile that would have brought me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the neck and throw him out the window . Then he shut the door in my face . I closed my eyes and pictured his head a punching bag . Did a few quick jabs , then slammed my foot into it . Hah . Not smiling so much are you now , Blaine ? " Shannon ? " Right . Standing there still facing a closed door with my eyes scrunched shut probably was n't quite the professional and together look I usually strove for . I turned back to Isabel . " Okay , so can you help me find a place for Friday ? " She gave me an apologetic smile that sent waves of terror thudding through my body . " I 'll try to find some time , I promise . Otto introduced him and told me his work took priority . You know I want to do your stuff , but ... " But Otto 's a bastard who would think nothing of carving you up into little pieces and you do n't want to risk that kind of a miserable death by arranging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I gritted my teeth and smiled . It was n't Isabel 's fault . " No problem . Just keep me posted on what you can do . " Isabel shot me a grateful smile , picked up a file that was n't mine and walked into Blaine 's office . Excellent . Perhaps if I became some ornery bitch , then people would be afraid to piss me off , and then I might actually get some respect around here . Yeah , right , the only way I could get away with being a bitch is if I had a J.D. and brought in buckets of money , neither of which applied in my particular case . Besides , my job was about being fun and nice and approachable and beloved . Keep those interns well fed and pampered , and make sure their stories about their summer outshone the stories of all their classmates who interned somewhere else . That was my job . A professional entertainer . Swallow your pride . Keep everyone fat and happy , and you may survive to see another summer . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self esteem issues . Never . I did n't have time for such ridiculous emotions . I had twenty-seven minutes to make sure the breakfast buffet was set up and the interns all had their name badges . I dropped my briefcase on the floor of my office , glanced at the note from Isabel that Friday night 's event was a bust , deleted three voice mails from my ex , tried not to wish I could crawl under my desk and hide , smoothed my bun , straightened my suit and marched into the hall to put on the Shannon Show . Some days I really loved my job . ( Continues ... ) by Stephanie Rowe
