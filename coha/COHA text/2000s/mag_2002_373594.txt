Back in the 1960s , Suzette ( Goldie Hawn ) and Vinnie ( Susan Sarandon ) were rock-'n ' - roll groupies . You know  --  lots of sex , dope and bad hairstyles . An increasingly disheveled Suzette still hangs on to the old lifestyle , while her pal  --  they are n't really sisters  --  has gone rich , suburban , uptight . Suzette visits Vinnie , looking for a loan , and manages to loosen up both her and her family . Writer-director Dolman 's comedy is n't exactly a barrel of emotional surprises , but its great cast underachieves admirably . There are worse ways to pass 94 minutes .  --  By Richard Schickel
