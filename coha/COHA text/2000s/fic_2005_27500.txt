Paintball in the Wild Michael Ortiz wiped the steam from his eyeglasses and turned off the iron . He held up the top of his military uniform . The creases in front were sharp . He felt pleased with himself , a cadet in seventh grade and with the rank of corporal . He had been in cadets only since the beginning of school and by October he already had two stripes , plus three ribbons for drill , hall patrol , and conduct . The conduct one was special because he used to be moody before he joined cadets . In sixth grade he sat through all his classes with his chin in his hand , his eyes half closed , and a yawn from boredom building up at the back of his throat . His grades were Cs and Ds . Sometimes he got into fights , but he usually thought they were just too much trouble . Now he was a year older . His body said so . He was two inches taller . " Sharp , " he said to himself . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of steam . He hung the shirt over his pants , already ironed , and pinned his ribbons back onto his uniform . He undid them when he noticed they were a little crooked over his shirt pocket . He petted the ribbons . He fogged the bars with his breath and polished them with a Kleenex , careful not to undo the creases on the front of his shirt . When he heard his mother holler from the kitchen , he turned away from his uniform . " Miguel ! Miguel , tel-f-onooooo ! Aprate ! Ya ! Tenemos que comer . " Michael , born Luis Miguel , wished that his mom could speak English , but she was in her own world , a world that remained rooted in Mexico . He loved her deeply and would never tell his mother to please learn English like hisfather had . His father was so proud that he would stop at telephone poles just to read posters aloud in an accented mutter . " Voy , Mami , " Michael answered back . He hurried out of his bedroom and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he smelled breakfast-papas and huevos con weenies . The little weenies were marching in the fry pan . Breakfast was almost ready . " Hey , " Miguel said . It was Trung , his classmate from Jackson Junior High and a corporal like himself but with one more ribbon than him-a bivouac ribbon because his platoon got to go camping and learn how to use a compass . Miguel made no bones that he was jealous of that extra ribbon on Trung 's shirt . He had repeatedly told his friend that he would have gone on the weekend bivouac except his mother did n't like him staying at anyone else 's house . When he 'd tried to explain that they were camping outdoors , she still remained firm . That evening he pouted in his room with the lights out . Not even the sight of his uniform could perk him up . " You gon na be ready ? " Trung asked . They were going to a paintball war in the foothills outside Fresno . He was going to tell their teacher , Mr. Mitchell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would count as a bivouac . " Nine-thirty , " Michael said . His eyes looked up at the clock over the refrigerator . " You gon na lend me the stuff ? " The stuff was a gun and goggles . " Yeah , like I said . " Trung reminded Michael that it cost twenty-five dollars , plus there were paintballs you had to buy . At least a thousand rounds were needed for the day . He also reminded him to bring drinking water . " I got water , " Miguel answered . Earlier in the week he had biked across town to an army surplus store and bought an authentic canteen . He liked that it was dented and imagined that bullets had ricocheted off its side . " And I got the money . " A rich uncle from Los Angeles had sent him fifty dollars for his birthday . Michael hung up the telephone . He stared at the frying pan , then at his mother , who asked , " Dos huevos ? " He held up two fingers , then saluted his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military boy . Michael sat in the back of Trung 's father 's truck , with his knees up to his chin . Although it was a sunny morning , he was cold in the whipping wind . He was wearing only a flannel shirt , flecked with paint that he figured would work as camouflage . His tennis shoes were also flecked with paint . He turned to Trung . " It 's cold . " " You should have brought a jacket , " his friend answered . The collar of his own jacket was flapping like a sail . " You did n't tell me . " But Michael knew that was a poor defense . A cadet , he knew , should be prepared for all kinds of weather conditions . He was glad that he had brought water . He patted his canteen and touched the front pockets of his pants , where he had stashed candy bars and pumpkin seeds . He closed his eyes , wrapped his arms around his chest , and rode out the cold . A half hour later the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Trung 's brother , Truc , and his friend Tran , were in the cab , each of them cradling the gun barrel with one hand and fingering the trigger set on safety with the other . Truc said something in Vietnamese to Trung . Their father said something , too , and it sounded like he was angry . " What did your father say ? " Michael asked . They were approaching the paintball war ground called No Man 's Land . " He said be careful . " To Michael it sounded like a lot of words just to say be careful . In Spanish it was simply cudate . When the truck stopped , the two boys gathered their equipment and jumped out of the back , landing like ninjas . Michael felt ready for combat and was already searching the trees for snipers . " Thanks , sir , " he called to Trung 's father , who was going fishing while the four boys went to war . Bright fishing lures hung from his vest like war medals . Trung 's father said something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and showed his ruined teeth . The truck pulled away , stirring up dust over the gravel road . The taillights flashed like gunfire when he braked at the end of the road . Then the truck turned left and was gone . " What did your dad say ? " Michael asked . " He said that his father died in the war . " Trung had shouldered his equipment . It was too late to say that he was sorry . He did n't know that Trung 's grandfather had been in the Vietnam War . He saw Trung in a new light . Maybe Trung deserved that bivouac ribbon after all on account of his grandfather getting killed . Michael 's own grandfather had gotten his foot crushed by a forklift , but that did n't count as much . " Let 's go , " Trung said , with his hand already in his pocket , searching for the twenty-five-dollar admission . They approached the front office . A woman with a tattoo of a butterfly on her throat sold them tickets and six cartridges that held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . The butterfly on her throat seemed to flap its wings when she spoke . Her breath was anything but candy . It smelled sour . Michael knew that the candies were overpriced . And he already had some candy in his pocket , enough to give his blood a good blast of energy . But he wanted to be friendly and said , " Okay . " He bought a Milky Way . Their hands were stamped and the four boys entered the gated area , where they walked down a dusty trail . At the end of the trail they came across three white men wearing T-shirts that said VIETNAM VETS . They were sitting on top of a picnic table , loading their guns . The men locked hard stares on the four boys .
