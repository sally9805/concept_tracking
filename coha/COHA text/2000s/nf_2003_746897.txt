Section : FEATURES <p> The presence of trihalomethanes ( THMs ) in potable-water sources is an issue of great interest because of the negative impact THMs have on human health . The objective of this study was to correlate the presence of trihalomethanes with more routinely monitored parameters of water quality , in order to facilitate THM control . Water samples taken at various stages of treatment from a water treatment plant were analyzed for the presence of trihalomethanes with the Fujiwara method . The data collected from these determinations were compared with the values obtained for free-residual-chlorine and **26;2917;TOOLONG levels as well as standard physico-chemical and microbiological indicators such as chemical oxygen demand ( by the KMn0sub4 method ) , total chlorophyll , conductivity , pH , alkalinity , turbidity , chlorides , sulfates , nitrates , nitrites , phosphates , ammonia , calcium , magnesium , heterotrophic bacteria count , Pseudomonos spp. , total and fecal coliforms , and fecal streptococci . The data from these determinations were compiled , and statistical analysis was performed to determine which variables correlate best with the presence and quantity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water seem to correlate directly with levels of combined residual chlorine and nitrates , and inversely with the level of free residual chlorine . Statistical analysis with multiple linear regression was conducted to determine the best-fitting models . The models chosen incorporate between two and four independent variables and include chemical oxygen demand , nitrites , and ammonia . These indicators , which are commonly determined during the water treatment process , demonstrate the strongest correlation with the levels of trihalomethanes in water and offer great utility as an accessible method for THM detection and control . Introduction <p> Trihalomethanes ( THMs ) are compounds derived from methane that incorporate three halogenated atoms . Of particular public health interest are THMs derived from bromine and chlorine , especially chloroform ( CHClsub3 ) , dichloro-bromomethane ( CHClsub2Br ) , chlorodibromo-methane ( CHClBrsub2 ) , and bromoform ( CHBrsub3 ) . Many substances act as precursors of these compounds ; humic acids have been widely studied for this reason ( Li &; Sun , 2001 ; Singer , 1999 ) . Formation of THMs becomes very important during the process of chlorination , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by-products ( Garcia Villanova , Garcia , Gmez , Garcia , &; Ardanuy , 1997 ; Rathbun , 1997 ) . <p> THMs have diverse negative effects on environmental and human health , including toxicological , mutagenic , and carcinogenic effects , as well as induction of congenital malformations and retarded fetal growth ( Boorman et al. , 1999 ; Bove , Shim , &; Zeitz , 2002 ; Lvesque et al. , 2002 ) . For these reasons , the containment of even small levels of THMs is very important . Alternatively , water may be disinfected with oxidative reactants other than chlorine ( Camel &; Bermond , 1998 ; Paune , Caixach , Espadaler , Om , &; Rivera , 1998 ; Razvigotova , Budinova , Petroy , &; Minkova , 1998 ) . IHM content should be evaluated periodically , even in waters of generally good quality . No systematic monitoring system is , however , currently in place to serve this purpose in waters of acceptable quality . It would be very useful to know which of the already habitually monitored variables could also serve as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examine the relationship between THMs and the parameters more commonly determined in the control of chlorinated water . The objective was to identify the variables that could best indicate the presence of THMs . The information could subsequently be incorporated into current monitoring systems . Methods <p> This study was conducted with 50 water samples from the drinking-water treatment plant of Granada ( Spain ) . Of these samples , 16 were taken from pretreatment water ( and therefore were not chlorinated ) , and 34 were taken from water during and after treatment with coagulation-flocculation , clarification , filtration , and chlorine gas . <p> The amounts of free residual chlorine ( FRC ) , combined residual chloride ( CRC ) , and total residual chlorine ( TRC ) present in samples were determined with N , **26;2945;TOOLONG , following the DPD ferrous titrimetric method ( American Public Health Association APHA , 1989 . Quantities of trihalomethanes were detected through the Fujiwara reaction ( Huang &; Smith , 1984 ) . In this test , 10 milliliters ( 10 mL ) of pentane is added to a volumetric flask containing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tested . The flask is sealed and agitated for three minutes , then left to rest until two separate layers become apparent . The pentane layer is removed and added to a tube containing 2 mL of 50 percent sodium hydroxide ( NaOH ) and 3 mL of pyridine . This tube is placed in a water bath at 45C for 30 minutes to facilitate the evaporation of pentane . Next , the temperature of the bath is raised to 55C for 45 minutes , then raised again to 95C for another 45 minutes . Immediately following this step , 2 mL of the pyridine layer ( which has developed a red color ) is removed and transferred to a 1-centimeter glass cuvette . Without the solution being allowed to cool , the absorbance is measured in the spectrophotometer at 550 nanometers ( 550 nm ) . To create a calibration curve for this test , 1 mL of bromoform and 1 mL of chloroform are added together to 1,000 mL of methanol . The total concentration of THMs for this solution is 4.37 milligrams per milliliter ( 4.37 mg/mL ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and 0.4 mL of the initial 4.37 mg/mL THM solution , and each one is diluted to a final volume of l L with distilled water . These solutions are then processed in the same manner as the water samples . <p> The chemical oxygen demand ( CODsubMn ) of the solutions was determined with the potassium permanganate ( KMnOsub4 ) - based method , by boiling in an acidic medium ( Rodier , 1978 ) . Total chlorophyll was determined through extraction by sonication in methanol and spectrophotometric determination ( Espigares , Ferez Lpez , Fernndez-Crehuet , &; Glvez , L996 ) . Conductivity , pH , alkalinity , turbidity chloride , sulfate , nitrate , nitrite , phosphate , ammonia , calcium , and magnesium were all determined by the usual procedures ( APHA , 1989 ) . The saturation index ( SI ) was calculated theoretically from the conductivity , alkalinity , pH , and calcium values ( Espigares Garcia &; Ferez Lpez , 1999 ) . The aerobic bacteria count at 22C and 37C was determined with the pour plate method , with tryplone glucose yeast agar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agar tergilol-7 , and were incubated at 37C for total coliforms and 44C for fecal coliforms ; fecal streptococci were quantified through membrane filtration and incubation in m-Enteroccocus agar ( APHA , 1989 ) . The presence of sulfite-reducing clostndia was determined by quantification of spores in an anaerobic iron-sulphite-glucose agar medium . The Pseudomoncis plate count was conducted in a Pseudomoncis base agar ( Oxoid ) supplemented with centrimide , nalidixic acid , and glycerol ; following incubation at 37C , the plate was developed with 0.5 percent N , N , N ' , N ' **36;2973;TOOLONG dichloride to differentiate oxidase-positive colonies . <p> The statistical treatment of the data was accomplished with the SPSS for Windows software package ( SPSS , Inc. , Chicago ) . A basic statistical analysis of the data was performed , and a model for the THM content as a function of other parameters was evaluated through simple and multiple regression analyses . Results <p> The water in this case was subjected to prechlorination with a mean value of 1.54 mg of chlorine per liter and postchlorination with 0.4 mg of chlorine per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the parameters before and after treatment . The statistical test for independent means shows that only characteristics of water implicated directly in treatment processes differ significantly between the two groups of samples . <p> Table 2 gives the simple-linear-regression equations for the parameters that demonstrate a significant correspondence with the THM content of the water samples ; the linear regression for the rest of the parameters is not significant . The multiple-regression models that demonstrate a significant statistical correlation with THM content are given in Table 3 . These models were calculated for the parameters that displayed a significant simple linear regression or that improved either the value of R- or the level of statistical relevance for the regression . Discussion <p> As may be deduced from the results shown in Table 1 , the water analyzed for this study was of high quality both before and after treatment with coagulation-flocculation , clarification , filtration , and chlorination . Treatment significantly altered only the variables directly implicated in these processes . The pH value of the water dropped slightly as a result of disinfection with chlorine gas and consumption of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CODsubMn and microbiological parameters demonstrate that before treatment the water had minimal fecal contamination , which was further reduced through the treatment . Because the samples of treated water were drawn directly following filtration , the reduction of organic material and microbiological components was incomplete , despite partial prechlorination . The process usually terminates during the storage time post-chlorination . The efficiency of the clarification treatment is confirmed by a statistically significant reduction in turbidity . The treatment process also produced statistically significant changes in the level of chloride , which was increased by the addition of chlorine , and in the level of magnesium , which decreased slightly . The saturation index had a mean value of 0.33 before treatment ( an SI &gt;0 indicates that calcium carbonate will precipitate ) . Following treatment however , the SI mean value was - 0.12 , which showed the water to be weakly corrosive . <p> THMs were detected in untreated water at a mean concentration of 149 micrograms per liter ( 149 g/L ) ; this value increased following chlorination treatment . The treated-water samples produced a greater value for THMs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values exceed the maximum contaminant level for total THMs of 80 g/L set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( U.S. EPA ) , as well as the maximum contaminant level set by European legislation at 100 g/L ( Consejo de Europa , 1998 ; U.S. EPA , 2002 ) . Nevertheless . 66 percent of the samples examined in this study had a THM level below 100 g/L . A mean value of 70.1 micro ; g/L is obtained when only samples that contain FRC ( indicating that they are sufficiently chlorinated ) are considered . <p> Of the parameters studied , only those listed in Table 2 demonstrated statistical significance in linear regression . In contrast to other published results ( Rathbun , 1996 ) , pH did not significantly correlate with THM levels , and the model in Table 2 shows that the content of THMs decreases as the concentration of free residual chlorine increases . In addition , no statistically significant regression was obtained for chlorophyll as in previously reported models ( Golfinopoulos &; Arhonditsis , 2002 ; Golfinopoulos , Xilourgidis , Kostopoulou , &; Lekkas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exists between the concentration of THMs and the microbiological or chemical indicators of fecal contamination . Of the models included in Table 2 , it is interesting to note the correlation of THMs with CRC . a parameter routinely determined in the control of disinfection , indicating the presence of organic substances that arc not completely oxidized by chlorine . On the other hand , it is known that the THM content is related to the presence of organic substances such as humic and fulvic acids in water ( Singer , 1999 ) , which are generally derived from sediment runoff containing organic compounds . This fact could explain the significant relation between nitrates and THMs ( Table 2 ) . <p> To define the best-fitting models , the authors completed statistical analysis with multiple linear regression , incorporating two or more independent variables . The models that demonstrate a significant statistical correlation are displayed in Table 3 . These models were calculated for the parameters that displayed a significant simple linear regression or that improved either the value of R- or the level of statistical relevance for the regression . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chlorine and nitrates ( Rsu ; = .543 , p &lt; .001 ) and the one incorporating CODsubMn and nitrates ( R = .539 , p &lt; .001 ) show the best fit . In general , as can be seen in Table 3 , the statistically significant models of multiple linear regression include the following independent variables : CRC ; nitrogenated inorganic substances ( nitrates , nitrites , and ammonia ) ; and CODsubMn . The level of significance increases with the number of variables taken into consideration . Equations with three independent variables ( CRC , nitrite , and nitrate Rsu ; = .615 , p &lt; .001 or nitrite , nitrates , and ammonia R = .764 , p &lt; .0011 ) and equations with four independent variables ( nitrite , nitrate , ammonia , and CODsubMn R = .768 , p &lt; .001 ) - adequately explain the THM content . Conclusion <p> Some substances routinely identified in drinking water may act as indicators of the presence of THMs . Through analysis of water samples with intermediate levels of THMs , starting with a simple linear model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model with four independent variables such as nitrite , nitrate , ammonia , and CODsubMn this study has found that these regression models have potential as a system for the detection of trihalomethanes . <p> Acknowledgements .
