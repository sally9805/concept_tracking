<p> NEW YORK  --  In a happy accident of timing , automakers are unveiling an array of SUVs designed for improved fuel economy just as the SUV-loving USA is being whacked with high fuel prices . <p> Beyond that , the SUVs on display at the auto show are significant as representatives of the next step in the evolution of sport utilities . They move even further from the appearance and rugged capabilities of traditional truck-style SUVs . <p> " A whole new breed  --  what I call ' capable cars , ' " says auto consultant Dan Gorrell at Strategic Vision . " They 're not true off-roaders . They 're tall cars , so they are more useful , and they have the advantages of all-wheel or four-wheel drive for ( bad ) weather , " he says . " People are seeing they do n't need a ( Ford ) Explorer or other traditional truck-based SUV . " <p> Explorer sales the first three months this year were down 25.4% from the same period a year ago , according to Autodata , despite a redesign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect Explorer to hold its title as best-selling SUV as buyers switch to more refined and now more graceful-looking and sporty-driving crossover SUVs . Though Explorer barely retained the No. 1 SUV spot the first three months , it was outsold by the likes of Ford 's about-to-be-discontinued Taurus sedan . <p> Acura and Mazda showed icons of the new-generation crossover SUVs . Not only do they look like cars , they offer high-performance engines and crisp handling . Even the Jeep Wrangler Unlimited unveiled here  --  inarguably a true off-road SUV  --  has been made more habitable . It 's longer and roomier than the conventional Wrangler and has , for the first time , four doors . <p> A look at those and others unveiled here : <p> Acura Acura RDX : This is the first showing of the production version of the 2007 compact SUV from Honda 's luxury brand . The marquee feature is the turbocharged four-cylinder engine . <p> It 's the first Honda turbo engine sold in the USA . It 's rated 240 horsepower and 260 pounds-feet of torque , easily matching Honda and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fuel-economy rating of 19 miles per gallon in town , 24 on the highway . <p> It 's also a tech showpiece . For example , the all-wheel drive is a version of the SH ( for Super-Handling ) system from the Acura RL flagship luxury sedan . It comes into play during vigorous cornering to keep the car aimed right and applying full power , as well as providing extra traction for slick roads . Real-time traffic reporting in major metropolitan areas also is cribbed from the RL . <p> RDX , on sale this summer , will be priced $30,000 to $37,000 . <p> It will be built at Honda 's Marysville , Ohio , factory on the same line as the Acura TL sport sedan . <p> Acura MDX : It 's billed as a concept vehicle , but it 's a close harbinger of the 2007 version of the brand 's popular MDX midsize crossover-utility vehicle . <p> The front is blunter , the wheel wells bulge more , and the stance is wider than the current version . Acura says it 's supposed to somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , real-time traffic reports and a high-end audio system are similar to those features in the Acura RL , the brand 's high-tech flagship sedan . <p> Honda was parsimonious with details . The ' 07 MDX will have a V-6 , as the current model does , but Acura would not give details on the engine or disclose other specifics about the vehicle . <p> Those will come nearer the fall on-sale date , the company said . <p> Mitsubishi Mitsubishi Outlander : The compact SUV is completely made over for 2007 . You can think of it as a Mitsubishi Lancer sports sedan done as an SUV , because it is built atop the platform to be used for the next-generation Lancer and super high-performance Lancer Evo . <p> Not in showrooms until November , the ' 07 Outlander gets a power boost from a standard 3-liter V-6 engine rated 220 horsepower and 204 pounds-feet of torque , which is teamed with a six-speed automatic transmission . Starting price will be about $23,000 , Mitsubishi says . <p> Premium options include navigation system and Rockford Fosgate stereo . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partial zero-emission vehicle . In other words , it is nearly pollution free . A ZEV would be an electric car that has no tailpipe emissions . <p> Front- and all-wheel-drive models will be offered . <p> Mazda Mazda CX-9 : The CX-9 looks like an enlarged version of the CX-7 , also on display here and shown at other shows earlier this year . <p> But Mazda has taken pains  --  a special announcement sent to journalists , for instance  --  to insist that the CX-9 is not a big 7 , nor is the 7 a small . The 9 uses " all-new platform architecture , " the company says . It will not be on sale until early next year . <p> The CX-9 has three rows of seats , accommodating seven passengers . Drivetrain is to be a new 3.5-liter V-6 and six-speed automatic transmission . Front- and all-wheel-drive versions will be available . Standard safety features will include anti-skid and anti-rollover systems . <p> Mazda says it will provide prices and more details closer to the on-sale date . <p> Mazda CX-7 : The five-passenger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a 2007 model . Power is from a 2.3-liter , turbocharged four-cylinder rated 244 horsepower and 258 pounds-feet of torque . Mazda forecasts a fuel-economy rating of 23 mpg in combined city-highway driving . <p> The curvy styling is intended to make you think of an SUV executed as a sports car . <p> Anti-skid and traction-control systems are standard . Front- and all-wheel-drive versions will be available . <p> Starting price is about $25,000 and the 7 probably will be popular enough at first that you 'll likely pay the full window-sticker price , according to online car-shopping site KBB.com . <p> Jeep Jeep Patriot : Patriot looks like a smaller version of the Grand Cherokee and will cost about $17,000 less . Jeep has n't released the price yet , but says it will be less than the $15,985 Jeep Compass . <p> Patriot takes its design cues from Cherokee , the recently departed iconic Jeep . It will be available in two-wheel drive , four-wheel drive and a trail-rated version that is capable of going off-road . <p> While critics argue that Patriot will water down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers who have n't been able to afford a Jeep . <p> " We feel there is a marketplace for people that have been interested in Jeep but have n't made it in " to the showroom , says Frank Klegon , executive vice president of product development for Chrysler Group . " It 's an expansion of Jeep , bringing in customers that may not have looked at us before . " <p> The Patriot comes with a 2.4-liter engine that produces 172 horsepower . <p> Jeep Wrangler four-door : In an attempt to broaden the market base for the traditional Wrangler , the two-door SUV that looks more comfortable on the beach than on the road , Jeep is rolling out a four-door version . <p> It 's aimed at buyers who need a fully functional back seat . " We wanted more room in the back seat so we could attract younger families , " Klegon says . But he acknowledges that the four-door version might end up cannibalizing sales from Jeep Liberty , which is also aimed at families . <p> It comes with a 205-horsepower V-6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has more cargo space than the 2006 Hummer H3 , 2006 Nissan Xterra and 2007 Toyota FJ Cruiser . <p> For parents who feel a little iffy about putting Junior in an SUV equipped with roll bars and a soft top , Jeep offers a hard-top version and makes electronic stability control and electronic roll mitigation standard equipment . <p> The price has not yet been announced . <p> Suzuki Suzuki XL7 : The biggest  --  and expected to be most expensive  --  Suzuki ever is the seven-passenger XL7 , built on a stretched-out chassis it shares with Chevrolet Equinox . <p> Fuel economy should be about 23 miles per gallon highway , which would be slightly better than the less-powerful V-6 in the previous version . <p> It 's due in showrooms late in the year , ranging from $23,000 to $29,000 with front- and all-wheel-drive versions . <p> Suzuki SX4 : So carlike it 's a car , although Suzuki labels it a sport-compact crossover , a description that hits all the hot buttons . Sport compacts are the small , front-drive cars favored by youthful , urban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls it a hatchback , a term that has negative connotations in the USA , where it implies a cheap small car . <p> SX4 goes on sale the third quarter as an ' 07 model , priced $15,000 to $18,000 . The powerplant is a 2-liter , four-cylinder rated 143 horsepower , 136 pounds-feet of torque . <p> All-wheel drive is standard . Suzuki calls it a three-mode system . The driver can select front-wheel drive , all-wheel-drive automatic or all-wheel-drive lock . In lock mode , 30% to 50% of the power is sent to the rear wheels . In auto mode , the system shifts power among the wheels for best traction and handling , up to a 50/50 split between front and rear . The lock mode is meant for lower speeds and challenging conditions . It shifts to all-wheel-drive automatic at 36 mph . <p> Suzuki predicts a fuel-economy rating of 24 mpg in the city , 30 mpg on the highway . <p> PHOTO , B/W , Mazda PHOTO , B/W , Mitsubishi PHOTO , B/W , Suzuki PHOTO , B/W , DaimlerChrysler via AP
