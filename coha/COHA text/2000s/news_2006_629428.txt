<p> Chip Beresford says he feels torn . <p> On one hand , he feels loyalty to the business in which he has prospered : the funeral industry . <p> On the other , he thinks he has suffered an injustice from funeral homes that he says have hurt him because they consider his prices too low . <p> Now Beresford - owner of The Pine Box in Houston , one of the largest distributors of caskets in Texas - is considering whether to join an antitrust lawsuit that aims to reduce funeral prices nationwide . The lawsuit , if it succeeds , could force the nation 's largest funeral businesses to refund billions of dollars to consumers . <p> Beresford says he has been on the receiving end of some of the anticompetitive behavior alleged in the lawsuit . Some funeral homes that are unhappy about his prices , which often are hundreds of dollars less than theirs , refuse to use his caskets , he says . <p> " They disparaged me , " he said . " They disparaged my product . " <p> Nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Casket Co. , Inc. of Whately , Mass. , in a lawsuit that has been combined with lawsuits filed by consumers . <p> The combined lawsuits accuse the world 's largest funeral-service company , Houston-based Service Corp . International , of conspiring with competitors , independent funeral homes and the country 's largest casket maker to fix prices and drive independent retailers such as Beresford out of business . <p> It alleges that the defendants have overcharged consumers by " hundreds of millions , if not billions , of dollars . " <p> Beresford , a licensed funeral director who once ran a funeral home , said joining the lawsuit would feel like " suing my brother . " <p> " I 've been through the same school , the same experiences , " he said . " Yet , I open this business up - which is legal to do , according to the rules of the industry - and they fight me , tooth and nail . And it 's all over greed . " <p> The consumers and Pioneer Valley are asking U.S. District Judge Kenneth Hoyt of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of consumers and independent casket retailers , respectively . <p> The nonprofit watchdog group Funeral Consumers Alliance , headquartered in Burlington , Vt. , is the lead plaintiff in the consumer lawsuits . It alleges a conspiracy to fix casket prices by SCI , competing funeral-home chain operators Alderwoods Group Inc. and Stewart Enterprises Inc. , and the country 's largest casket maker , the Batesville Casket Co . <p> " I would expect and hope ( the lawsuits ) would open that market and it would make competition for the sale of caskets more open and free , " said Joshua Slocum , Funeral Consumers Alliance executive director . <p> SCI spokesman Terry Hemeyer said , " The allegations in the case are contrary to SCI 's policies and training , and we expect to vigorously defend this matter . " <p> Alderwoods and Stewart did not respond to requests for comment . A spokeswoman for Batesville parent company Hillenbrand Industries , also a defendant , declined to comment . <p> Pressure tactics alleged <p> The lawsuits allege that the three national chains and independent funeral homes are pressuring Batesville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Matthew Cantor , one of the lead attorneys for the consumer lawsuits , says Batesville 's restrictions prevent retailers from selling its caskets , the most popular brand , thus making it easier for funeral homes to mark up casket prices by as much as 650 percent . <p> Doggett Whitaker - past president of the National Funeral Directors Association , which the retailers ' lawsuit accuses of aiding the conspiracy - said Batesville has a long-standing policy of selling only to licensed funeral directors . <p> " I ca n't say whether it 's a good policy or a bad policy , but I can say these companies have a right to decide who they want to sell to , " Whitaker said . <p> He also questioned whether the Batesville brand is important to consumers . " I have never had an individual walk into my funeral home and specifically ask for a named casket , " he said . <p> The lawsuits also accuse funeral homes of disparaging caskets sold by independent retailers , telling customers the handles will fall off or the bottoms drop out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Jessica Mitford wrote " The American Way of Death " in 1963 , accusing many funeral homes of taking advantage of grieving families to pile on expensive and unneeded services . <p> In " The American Way of Death Revisited , " published in 1998 , two years after her death , Mitford described a largely unreformed industry that had outfoxed the Federal Trade Commission . <p> She singled out SCI , accusing it of pumping up prices for caskets and funerals . <p> The consumer lawsuits mirror some of Mitford 's claims , saying many funeral homes are violating the FTC 's " funeral rule " to pile on expensive services . <p> Refrigeration fees <p> Plaintiffs Gloria Jaccarino Bender and Anthony Jaccarino accuse a Staten Island , N.Y. , funeral home of selling them a casket for $2,095 even though they asked to have their mother 's body cremated . <p> Slocum , the Funeral Consumers Alliance director , said some funeral homes charge $75 to $400 per day for refrigerating a body , although the cost to a funeral home is about $3 per day . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funeral rule , designed to halt such practices , that went into effect in 1984 . <p> " There is no excuse , 20 years after the funeral rule , for these rampant violations , " Slocum said . <p> Consumers are finding similar practices in Houston , said Derrick Wayne , a board member of the Funeral Consumers Alliance of Houston . <p> Corporate and independent funeral homes alike engage in practices such as charging as much as $1,495 for embalming , although it can be done for $200 , Wayne said . <p> He noted that , in many cases , funeral directors fail to mention that Texas law does not require embalming . <p> An old accusation ' <p> In response to lower prices offered by independent casket retailers , funeral homes are charging less for caskets but boosting the prices of other services to make up the difference , Wayne said . <p> Scott Gilligan , National Funeral Directors Association general counsel , said most funeral homes do not take advantage of their customers . <p> " It 's an old accusation , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends on repeat business . No industry is impacted more by reputation than the funeral industry . " <p> He also denied funeral homes make unfair profits . <p> " The fact of the matter is that funeral-home profits have fallen steadily , " Gilligan said . " They used to be 9 percent . Now they are down to around 7 percent . " <p> Profits are falling because there are too many funeral homes , said Lamar Hankins , a San Marcos lawyer and Funeral Consumer Alliance board member who helped prepare the antitrust lawsuit . <p> " The death rate just does n't support the funeral homes that we have , " Hankins said . " They are apt to charge these big prices for everything to pay the bills they get . " <p> Moved to Houston <p> Before landing in Houston , the antitrust lawsuit was filed in San Francisco earlier this year . SCI successfully moved to consolidate cases and transfer them to Houston after five nearly identical lawsuits were filed in other parts of the country . <p> At SCI 's request , Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco and one from Brownsville , the only Texas lawsuit . <p> Attorneys say the legal wrangling probably will drag on for years before coming to trial . Jenelle Welling , an attorney for Pioneer Valley , says the lawsuits strike so directly at SCI 's core business practices that a settlement is unlikely . <p> " They think their business model is critical to their survival , and I 'm essentially asking them to change their business model , " Welling said . <p> DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS <p> The Federal Trade Commission 's funeral rule was created to protect consumers in dealings with funeral homes . The rule tells consumers : <p> 1 . You have the right to refuse costly funeral packages and choose the goods and services you want , with the exception of the basic service charge . <p> 2 . The funeral provider must state this right in writing on the general price list . <p> 3 . If state or local law requires you to buy any particular item , the funeral provider must disclose it on the price list , with a reference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not refuse , or charge a fee , to handle a casket you bought elsewhere . <p> 5 . A funeral provider that offers cremations must make containers other than caskets available . <p> 6 . The funeral provider must offer a price list and give prices over the phone if asked . <p> 7 . The funeral provider must disclose in writing that embalming is not required by law . <p> 8 . The funeral provider may not charge a fee for unauthorized embalming . <p> Source : FTC consumer guide <p> NOTES : harvey.rice@chron.com STEVE UECKERT : CHRONICLE @x Opportunity Missed As a religion teacher and a head coach at a Jesuit high school ( and an amateur athlete myself ) , I was excited to receive the Oct. 20 issue with the cover photo and headline The Soul of Sports . " Unfortunately , I was disappointed by what I found inside . None of the articles addressed the essential issue alluded to on your cover . What is the proper role of athletics in Catholic schools , especially Catholic universities ? The lack of discussion was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ featuring two AfricanAmerican basketball players . On so many Jesuit campuses , minority students are woefully underrepresented , except in our athletic departments . The tremendous amount of money that Catholic universities accrue as a result of these " amateur " student athletes raises weighty issues about race , class and privilege . The Oct. 20 issue also failed to explore the impact that sports figures have on our culture . The young people I teach and coach are astonishingly aware of the exploits and accomplishments of athletes at the professional and collegiate levels . We live in a culture where athletes are heroes . Finally , Patrick Kelly , S.J. , spends much of his article " Sports and the Spiritual Life " discussing the idea of " flow . " But there was very little about the educational and spiritual formation that can be brought about by physical fitness and competition . The fundamental question we must ask ourselves is this : How will we measure success ? At the end of the season , were my boys more loving than when we began ? Were they more generous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did they simply run faster and win more than in past seasons ? What can we do to help student athletes develop their physical and spiritual abilities ? Working with them to make and deliver sandwiches for the hungry , having senior captains offer the Gospel reflection at a team liturgy , praying with our rivals before a race-all of these moments are profound opportunities for our students to see that the spiritual life is not lived simply on retreat , during Sunday Mass or in their one hour of religion class each day . When they can bring their faith to all aspects of their lives , their religious imagination and our entire faith community are enriched . Chad Evans San Francisco , Calif . Study War No More I appreciated the recent articles concerning war and military chaplaincy ( " Showing God 's Face on the Battlefield , " by John J. McLain , S.J. , The Chaplain 's Dilemma , " by Tom Cornell , and " One War at a Time , " by Gregory D. Foster , 11/17 ) , but I was concerned by Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes that Christ is present on the battlefield , but he fails to mention that where he is most vividly present is in the dying people who are directly affected by the destruction of war . I agree that it is essential to " minister to those who need God . " Such ministerial duties involve evangelization-speaking messages like " do n't kill " and " love your enemies " while denouncing messages like " kill other people " and " destroy your enemies , " both favorites of the military . The church might well consider many women opting to have an abortion as candidates for those " most in need of God , " yet I wonder how many chaplains are sent to minister in abortion clinics , where Christ also can be found ? Dan Cosacchi Chestnut Hill , Mass . Caesar and God Re Tom Cornell 's article on military chaplaincy ( " The Chaplain 's Dilemma , " 11/17 ) : By about 30 A.D. , the Roman army had conquered much of the th enknown world . They were n't nice guys , and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boy Scout camp . Nevertheless , when a Roman centurion reached out on behalf of his dying slave , Jesus acted and saved the slave . The Gospel of Luke reports that Jesus was amazed at that centurion 's faith . The Lord judged the individual soldier , not the whole army . Similarly , Catholic chaplains are needed to help individual service members who are struggling to serve both Caesar and God . Michael E. Kennedy Groton . Conn . A Writer 's Life Thank you for a beautiful tribute to Jon Hassler ( " The Last Catholic-Novelist " 11/3 ) . Having lived and worked on the Saint John 's University campus in Collegeville , Minn , for 30 years , I felt honored to know Jon as a friend . We often talked about his forthcoming novels . When asked how he chose names for his characters , he told me he walked through cemeteries and read names on tombstones . I once asked him how he got his plot ideas and , with a quiet chuckle , Jon said , " I sit in greasy spoon restaurants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next boodi . " I believe that is what made Jon 's characters so real . I will always remember Jon as a softspoken , humble and beautiful individual . It was sad to watch his health deteriorate so fast as he spoke of the many novels he yet had to write , stories that we will never get to read . Dolores Schuh , C.H.M. Davenport , Iowa Author , Author As I read the wonderful article on Jon Hassler ( " The Last Catholic Novelist " 11/3 ) , I kept thinking that one truly Catholic writer is not mentioned , one whose sacramental imagery surprises and delights and even awes the reader , and that is the author of the piece , the Rev. Andrew M. Greeley . Bravo and many thanks to Father Greeley for the writings he has given us , where grace is to be found and celebrated and lavishly , freely given . Gene Szarek , C.R. Chicago , Ill . Early Evidence I think Tom Cornell raises some good points in " The Chaplain 's Dilemma " ( 11/17 ) . Chaplains should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their conscience while serving in the military . As a conscientious objector myself , I am very thankful for the support I received from my base chaplain many years ago . His understanding of my decision and the reasons for it served to confirm the underlying principles of my convictions . The fundamental problem with chaplaincy , however , is the witness it gives to the world ; it gives the impression that military service is objectively compatible with Christian faith . According to the Catechism of the Catholic Chimb , it is , of course ; but I question whether that teaching can be reconciled with the church 's earliest teachings on war . All the earliest evidence points to an ultimate reverence for the image of God in humanity and a total prohibition of bloodshed . St Paul criticized the Corinthians for suing one another in court ; what would he say about Christians lolling each other in defense of their nation-states ? Jonathan D. Lace Montclair , N.J.
