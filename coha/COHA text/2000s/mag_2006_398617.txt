Section : Music Multimillionaire business exec Shawn Carter  --  Jay-Z to you  --  is 36 and still has n't lost his street cred . How 'd he manage that ? <p> No flashbulbs go off when Jay-Z enters the small downstairs lobby of Soho House , an exclusive hangout looking down on Manhattan 's trendy meatpacking district . In fact , no one really even notices the 6-foot-2 guy in droopy jeans and zip-up hoodie until coming face to face with him in the elevator . " Jay ! " shrieks a surprised passenger . The passenger 's with a shorter friend who 's stunned into silence . If only they 'd known they 'd meet the premier music mogul , entrepreneur and hip-hop MC of their generation  --  they would 've worn their good sneakers . The taller one chatters nervously about some club in Jersey , as his stout buddy 's face settles into a frozen smile . Jay-Z puts them at ease with a few simple interjections . " Really ? " " Yeah , that 's cool . " By the time they reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shake hands with him . They even give him a slap-on-the-back goodbye . <p> No civilian could ever get that close to Diddy  --  let alone dare touch him . But Jay-Z , a.k.a . Shawn Carter , is not your average hip-hop high roller . Carter , 36 , is so conspicuously bling-free and so consistently pleasant that you wonder if he morphs into a megalomaniacal tyrant behind closed doors . At dinner  --  for which he 's dressed in shell-toed Adidas , baggy Rocawear jeans and a Ferragamo blazer  --  he orders a $615 bottle of wine at dinner , then looks uncomfortable throughout the **36;1070;TOOLONG routine . He appears more laid-back than ambitious , more warm than studied , charismatic but not aggressive . He even raps in his own natural speaking voice  --  unlike almost any rapper you can think of . It 's not that there 's no distinction between the star and the man  --  it 's that he navigates between them so gracefully . <p> There must be something burning beneath Carter 's low-key exterior . How else does a high-school dropout from Brooklyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suites ? Carter is now worth an estimated $320 million , runs the seminal hip-hop label Def Jam and dates probably the hottest woman on the planet , Beyonc Knowles . And he 's got a brand-new CD about to come out  --  his 10th in 10 years  --  " Kingdom Come . " It 's his first since he " retired " as a rapper in 2003 , and judging by the buzz , it should be one of his most successful . This month , in partnership with the United Nations , he appears in an MTV documentary about the water crisis in Africa . Whatever is at work in him , it 's made him one of the most compelling figures in the music business . <p> Carter still sees himself as an outsider  --  the street-smart guy in the boardroom , the black man in a roomful of whites , the rapper convening with the secretary-general . " I do n't look at myself as part of that executive club , " he says . " I look at myself as the oddball who made it here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my back , ' How 'd he get here ? ' I know my story 's an uncommon story . I 'm amazed at it still . I just played Poland and they knew all the words to my songs . Poland ! They were singing the B-sides . I 'm like , ' What is this ? Who am I ? ' " <p> That 's been the question at least since Carter was a teenager obsessed with rhyme and rapping . " Before I started recording I had this green notebook that I used to write in incessantly , " he recalls . " I would walk through the Marcy projects , where everyone 's playing basketball , with my notebook , and that was not a cool thing . You went to school because you had to , but you did not carry books . " As a raw rapper , he could n't get any label to give him a record deal , so in 1995 he and now-estranged business partner Damon Dash started Roc-A-Fella Records with Kareem Burke , and quickly established the label with seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outsider intuition is redefining Def Jam 's roster . He 's proved adept at timing the label 's releases , promoting records and finding talent . ( Of course , his own records make money , too . ) Since coming onboard two years ago , he 's brought in Kanye West  --  offering hip-hop its newest hope  --  as well as the highly respected Roots , his old rival Nas and such lucrative discoveries as Young Jeezy , Ne-Yo and Rihanna . His oddest choice was the scrappy Lady Sovereign  --  white , British , rapping in barely decipherable slang  --  Britain 's female Eminem . " Ah , the biggest little midget , " he says with a smile . " Sometimes you got ta give the outsiders a chance . " <p> Carter 's been given a scary one at Def Jam . " It 's the biggest hip-hop label of all time , " he says . " If that thing falls apart , it 's on my head . I was naive enough to believe I can do it . " And according to Doug Morris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's put Def Jam back on the map . Everything he touches gets cooler . " Morris does n't seem to mind that Carter 's been concentrating his cool-making powers on . Jay-Z . His collaborators on the new CD are the best in the business  --  West , Dr. Dre , Coldplay 's Chris Martin  --  and Jay 's wordplay is as inventive and associative as ever : " Sellin ' blow in the park this is knowin ' my heart/now I 'm so enlightened I might glow in the dark/I been up in the office you might know him as Clark/ just when you thought the whole world fell apart I/Take off the blazer loosen up the tie/ Step inside the booth Superman is alive . " It 's clear why some people think he 's hip-hop 's greatest MC . " There has to come a day when I stop making records , " he says over dinner . " I think it would have been easier 10 years ago , because even though I had the inclination and talent , I did n't love it passionately . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> He 's so in love , in fact , that he 's still messing with the tracks , only weeks before the record 's release . In the limo on the way to the studio , he 's already in a working trance , replaying and replaying five bothersome seconds ; what 's wrong is detectable only to him . Much of his success comes from such attention to detail  --  and a sense of how great a difference subtleties can make . This is why , he says , it 's so hard to copy such true rap innovators such as OutKast . " You have to make ' Hey Ya ! ' with 100 percent integrity , " he explains , as if he were using a PowerPoint flow chart to make himself clear . " There 's very little margin of error in that song . If you miss it by half a degree , it 's Weird Al Yankovic wacky karaoke music . " Satisfied that he can remedy the problems he 's heard , he flips on the radio and Beyonc 's " Irreplaceable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carter jokingly mimics her high notes , each with a little squeak and a laugh . It 's the only time he acknowledges  --  and then only tacitly  --  their relationship . <p> " The funny thing , " Carter says , " is that I never wanted to be famous . When I was making money dealing drugs , I had the sense of being famous before I was famous . " Now that he 's making megamoney  --  enough to own at least one Manhattan skyscraper and a stake in the New Jersey Nets basketball team  --  his next dream is to bring the Nets to his old ' hood . He 's part of a $2.5 billion Brooklyn renovation project that includes moving the team to the borough and housing it in a Frank Gehry-designed stadium complex . Many area residents are n't happy about the prospect of more traffic and higher real-estate prices . " It 's a switch for me to be on this development side of things , " Carter says . " You just have to know in your heart that you 're doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Brooklyn ? It would bring so much pride  --  forget about it ! I might cry the first day if it ever happens . You know how people from Brooklyn get about Brooklyn . " <p> Not everyone buys into the idea of Jay-Z as regular guy and reluctant celebrity . When the veteran rapper and actor LL Cool J 's last Def Jam record tanked , he cut loose backstage at the MTV awards : " I think Jay-Z does a very good job , " he reportedly said . " Of promoting Jay-Z . " Cool J will leave Def Jam after his next record . Anyone who thinks that Carter took on his job at Def Jam simply to be a nurturing mentor has n't been paying attention . Though he 'd had plenty of experience at Roc-A-Fella helping artists in and out of the studio as well as running a business , there 's no doubt that Jay-Z is largely about expanding the Jay-Z brand . Those are his hands starring in the newest Hewlett-Packard laptop ad . ( This may be closest HP will ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his new album debuted as part of a " Monday Night Football " Budweiser Select commercial . <p> One of Jay-Z 's biggest challenges now is how to continue this march into the mainstream without losing his street appeal . Dash , the ex-partner who has since severed his ties with Jay-Z by selling his entire stake in Rocawear and Roc-A-Fella , ran into a suit-wearing Jay-Z in an elevator recently . He later told Rolling Stone , " I do n't even know that guy anymore . " But judging by the excitement around the new album  --  and all the kids who still wear Jay-Z 's Rocawear clothes in clubs  --  he 's still got his credibility . " We 've seen rappers killed , or just fall off , " says Island Def Jam chairman L. A. Reid . " Now we 're watching the biggest rapper remain the biggest rapper . We 've never seen this movie before . " Amazingly , Carter has largely dodged the label of sellout . " The only backlash I feel is from being too big , you know ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I get it  --  the gift of discovery is everything with the cutting-edge kids . But as far as the culture goes , I bring hip-hop where I go . " <p> Including to the United Nations . Before his tour of Africa earlier this year , he wanted to do something to help the troubled continent , so he visited the United Nations , learned that the mounting water crisis was a top priority and approached the secretary-general . It 's unlikely that Kofi Annan worried about the issue of Carter 's street cred when they met , but the secretary-general certainly knew that people under 30 are more likely to listen to Jay-Z than Kofi-A . The result of their meeting is the new MTV documentary called " The Diary of Jay-Z : Water for Life . " Carter traveled to impoverished villages throughout Africa , bringing with him the gift of clean water . " I 've given money and written checks , " he says , " but when you 're on the ground and you turn on the faucet and the village get water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> But even movers and shakers get tired . Tonight , in the car on the way home after another long day , Carter looks exhausted . He 's been up since 5 , done three radio interviews and a photo shoot , and made , give or take , a million executive decisions . It 's now 10:30 p.m. , and he still has to go over some final album tracks when he gets home . He spots a copy of GQ tucked in the back of the seat . " You know I got voted ' Man 's Man ' ? " He rubs his closely shaved head . " I was number ten , Clooney was number one . I 'm not sure what magazine it was , all I know is that I 'm a manly man , " he says , flexing an arm and laughing . Carter 's laughter is clearly spontaneous : his voice often cracks like a kid 's . It seems improbable that someone with so much ambition could be so uncalculatedly endearing . So is that what the calculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all ? <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Visionary : Carter got his first taste of fame growing up in the projects <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Jay 's World : With Prince Charles , Bill Gates , Nets , Beyonc <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Low-key king : This is one superstar so laid back he even raps in his own natural voice <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By Lorraine Ali <p>
