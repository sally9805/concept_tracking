When First We Met Monday , December 10 , 1842 North Carolina Chang-Eng , " the children chanted . " Mutant , mutant . " Now and then the little innocents sprang from the dust cloud chasing our carriage to cry my name and Chang 's . The path we traveled cut through a droughty careworn field , and to either side of us a fast-passing scene of blond grass and dead milkweed thirsted under the burnt sky of sunset . My ear tingled with the nearness of my brother , who picked lint off of my shoulder and knew not to bump my head as he did so . His dark eyes showed little reflections of me . I was thirty-one . My life was about to begin : I was entering North Carolina . My brother and I did not know that love was soon to deliver us . But twenty-one children and three decades later , how obvious it seems that everything to follow was a consequence of that evening . When you know you are dying , self-deceptions fly from your bedside like embers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final chance to bind together circumstances that have made you a peasant who sells duck eggs on the Mekong one day and the South 's most famous temperance advocate the next , you see a curtain open onto the landmark moments of your past . When Chang and I arrived in North Carolina , we were coming to the end of yet another tour , exhibiting the bond that the public could not see without assuming we two were so very different from everybody else . The halfwit we 'd hired drove at a quick pace . And now , jounced insidea rickety carriage that had the legend THE SIAMESE TWIN in chipping yellow paint on its doors , I was trying to nap beside Chang . My eyes were not closed for long . My brother tapped my shoulder . " Eng ? " I knew better than to ask him to quiet when he was in one of his talkative moods . " Maybe , " Chang said , " you read out loud ? " He spoke in a soft voice whenever asking me for something . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes more tightly . " I 'd prefer not . " " A Shakespeare speech from your book , make the trip go faster ? " There was a shiver in his words from the bustle of our ride . I felt his half of our stomach spasm . " Let me please catch a little rest , " I said , opening an eye . " Why do n't you read it yourself ? " " Me ? You joking . " The listlessness in Chang 's smile suggested what it is to spend three decades within five to seven inches of one another . " Eng ? " Reporters love to mention that I am the " less dominating member of the pair . " A man may be quiet , does that mean he is not assertive ? " Eng ? " That we had n't eaten in hours spoiled his breath . I shut my eyes tight again . Nailing down a personality is about as easy as pinning marmalade to a wall . I faked a snore . " Eng ! " he said , patience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I know you not asleep . " The dust of riding whisked us into Wilkesboro , the last stop on this junket of somersaults and smiles that had spanned the eastern seaboard . I could not have imagined that in Wilkesboro we would meet the women who wouldfor all the kings I 'd met and the nations I 'd beenmake up the kingdom in which I 'd walk . Chang had the driver bridle our two horses to a stop in a grassy square near the center of town : a little commons that had not yet changed its name from " Union Square " to " Westwood Park . " This open space was blotchy with killed grass , its unused flagpole stood without purpose in the wind . A line of four threadbare trees gesticulated like marionettes behind the flagstaff . Townspeople rushed at us from every direction . Dozens of unkempt children and their unkempt parents gathered round our carriage , pointing fingers . The rest of the population climbed on roofs for a better view . My brother grinned at them all . He delivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a casual flick that his hand is clean on both sidesthe motion Queen Victoria used to greet her masses . " Come down , carriage man , " my brother called out to our driver , wetting my face with spittle . " Will you please open door ? " The driver muttered at us from his buckboard . I asked this idiot , " Did you say something ? " He let us out , his well-shaved cheeks pink as Mekong tuna meat . He said , " Nothing , sirs . " " You are addressing Eng alone . " I accepted the man 's hand , stepping from the carriage with my brother close on my left . " Do you hear my twin talking ? You must say , Nothing , sir . ' " I was tired and irritable . " When you speak to Eng , you speak to one sir , ' not two . " Far away , between the rough corners of Wilkesboro 's buildings ( small white Presbyterian church with no steeple , narrow white beer parlor , small white general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rows of sleeping blue mountains hid in shadow , each more blurred than the last . And the full moon had begun its crawl across the sky . Everything about this environment seemed animated by our arrival : the crowd gathering on all sides of us ; the bandy-legged old man in a white suit who limped across Union Square with a yellow rose in his lapel , and the pair of young girls who ran over and walked him arm in arm toward our carriage ; the slaves across the courtyard pitching straw and pretending not to look ; the dirty little white hands poking our ligament as we stepped from the carriage . Several reached for my face . " Chang-Eng ! " Even the dirtiest of children radiant like they 'd just been given candy . " Mutant , mutant ! " " Thank you , " Chang and I said as the dust gathered on our identical black suitstight and crisply English in cut , the very ones Barnum had bought for us . Strolling through the crowd , my brother and I were two complete bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven-inch-long ligament resembling a forearm . " Chang-Eng acknowledging you , good people " Chang said . We crossed Main Street side by side , in the calibrated rhythm of our united movement , arms sweaty over each other 's shoulders . Like Chang , I wore my hair in a black braid long enough to curl around my head . I tied it in a blue silk tassel that fell over my brother 's shoulder , as his fell over mine . North Carolina was a welcome change from Boston , Washington , Philadelphia , New York , that series of East Coast cities that even before the War of Yankee Aggression had become as vulgar as a row of women of easy virtue on a street corner . Some believe the war divided America 's history in one stroke , all at once advancing Northern manufacturing and the forward parade of Yankee progress . But by December 1842 the North had swelled so hastily it simmered with industry and crime and most of all too many people , while Southern towns like this remained in rural condition , natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were so numerous across the map of North Carolina they seemed like stars in the nighttime sky , before Reconstruction hobbled the South . My brother kept his smile and had n't quit waving to the townsfolk . Few returned his greeting . A yellow-skinned man and his conjoined twin may be admitted into a village in North Carolina , but will never be adopted by it fully . Main Street was rounded , with a humped center and sloping sides , and it led us across town . Chang and I were silent as we walked ; I rarely spoke to him . At all times , a wordless debate concerning the fundaments of movement traveled across our bond like a message across telegraph wire , and that was conversation enough . I called this the Silence , and I was comforted by it . The people of Wilkesboro had begun to follow us at a distance : here two blond schoolgirls crouched behind a craggy black oak tree to stare ; there , in the Law Office Building , under the pressed-metal facade , a few cheerful boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scampering off to giggle behind some wagons tethered to the Court House gallery ; across the street near a livery stable a woman froze in her tracks to gape at the Twins , her face turning pale as death . A few townsfolk , however , did smile openly at us as we passed , and let fly a friendly giggle whenever Chang waved . " Eng , " Chang said , crimping his eyes as he often did when he found his happy place in the world . " It is exciting , yes ? " With his free hand he smoothed the lapels of his jacket . " Brother , I do n't know what you mean . " Chang was taken off guard ; he always managed to discount that we were miles apart in temperament . " Well , " he said , searching my face , " this , I mean ! " Crooking our ligament , he drew himself in front of and even closer to me , and he looked over my shoulder at the now large crowd following at our heels . Chang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my brother striding backwardas he flung his hand in the air and waved at the people . Everyone clapped . Chang swung around to face forward again . It was this sort of pandering showmanship that I hated , and strove to avoid for most of my career . ( Like most everybody , I am proud of certain accomplishments : that we never participated in , nor were in any way associated with , an American circus ; my predilection for reading , which saved me from the manner of immigrant speech that Chang never lost . ) Main Street came to an end at the Yates Inn . A Southern community such as Wilkesboro , in its distant relation not only to the central government , but also to neighboring villages , believes itself an individual , free from all others . And yet , little inns just like this one were features of nearly all minor Southern towns , and by now Chang and I felt at home loitering by innyards , waiting to be admitted . Wilkesboro 's version of the Southern hostel was a two-story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chokecherry . A giant woman sat on the inn 's drooping front porch , fanning herself in the skeletal shade of leafless oaks . She was some five hundred pounds , if not more , this innkeeper . Moist patches of her scalp were visible under her thin gray hair , like peat bog spied through the reeds of a marsh , and her hairline gave way to a glistening forehead just as a marsh would open onto a river . My brother and I came to stand before her , resting our two free hands on the porch railing . The lady innkeeper scrutinized Chang and me in our unforgiving black . " A charming creature " her bassy voice wiggled the flesh hanging below her chin " just about as strange as they say . " I could not tell whether the woman 's face was friendly or taunting . She wore a homemade dress of gray cloth-stuff made with no thought to style . Her skin refused contour . Birds shrieked in the trees . I imagined this woman a courtier in His Majesty King Rama 's palace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husbands danced around her , runty men with short life spans . To her left stood a frowning boy in a straw hat with a crooked rim . To her right , a pair of blond womenher daughters , I guessed , though they were not so younglong-faced , flat-chested , and each with lip rouge on her front teeth . The taller one 's eyes flickered impatiently , like the wings of little birds . The way she did not turn away in horror gave me the urge to saw through my ligament . It was the light at that hour , or my fatigue pressing in , but I believed she was smiling at me . My brother 's skin was mucky as the Mekong itself , his breathing a gasp . The declining sun acted on the girl 's fine hair , cutting it into elements of gold and pink gold and shadow . She blushed and bowed her head , but she continued to peek at me from under her brows with eyes the color of blueberries . She bit her lip . A young lady was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could not fathom itlooking into my eyes ! I returned her stare , I do n't know where I discovered the courage . Only a few seconds passed , evidently , though I was sure the moment slipped from the calendar . For the seeming eternity I stood there , my heart pounded only once , a single thunderclap , echoing . This strange girl 's clear eyes looked like safe worlds in which to escape the circumstance of what I was . Chang 's heart , too , began to go frantic for this tall blond innkeeper 's daughterI felt it . Was it me the girl was fixing her gaze on , or the twin close at my side ? The whole time , the girl 's sister stood in shadow and chewed at her nails . But before long this one was looking up into my face , too , without smiling or frowning . The entire town had gathered behind us , watching everything . And the sisters ' large mother leaned forward in her groaning seat and straightened her dress , patted her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her boy . " Go get your father . " Daintily , she removed a little gnat that had flown into her mouth . " Tell him I found a pair of husbands for your sisters . " I swear the townsfolk cheered .
