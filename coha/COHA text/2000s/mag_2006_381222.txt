Every new parent knows that having a baby means weeks without sleep . Should it also mean weeks without a paycheck ? That 's the stark choice confronting Shannon Thomas , 21 , a preschool teacher in southeastern Massachusetts . Her employer , the Boys and Girls Club of Taunton , agreed to hold her job for about six weeks after her June 18 due date but did n't offer any paid maternity leave . " My rent , food , the hospital  --  those costs are n't going away , " Thomas says . So she quit her $500-a-week job three weeks ago and applied for state welfare assistance . " I 'd rather work , " she says . " But I had to get whatever help I could . " <P> As Thomas takes her improvised leave , lawmakers in her home state are hammering out what they hope will be a better alternative . The Massachusetts legislature plans to vote this week on a bill that would give all employees in the state 12 weeks of paid medical leave annually  --  100% of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold their jobs  --  to care for newborns or sick relatives . If passed , the bill would mandate the most generous paid-leave policy in the U.S. ; it is the first of 24 similar proposals pending this year . Family friendly and popular with female voters , most of the bills are enjoying wide , bipartisan support , says Debra Ness , president of the National Partnership for Women &; Families . " We 're seeing real movement toward more paid leave . "
