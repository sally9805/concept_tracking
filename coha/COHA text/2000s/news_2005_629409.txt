<p> LIKe any animal lover worth his salt , Jared Anderson takes in strays . <p> But his salvation projects do n't leave hairballs on the carpet or yap to the disturbance of his neighbors . Anderson 's strays are more of the type that just give most folks the willies . <p> Of the about 20 aquariums stacked around the interior of the reptile collector 's Spring house , 13 hold snakes , while inside the other containers are such exotics as a Leopard tortoise , frog-eyed geckos and bearded dragons . <p> Repugnant to some , these cold-blooded reptiles give Anderson the warm fuzzies . <p> " She 's a sweetie , " he said , cradling an iguana-looking creature called a bearded dragon that he rescued and nursed back to health . " I take her around a lot . They 're good pets . " <p> The number of reptiles he owns is ever-changing because Anderson , who catches nuisance snakes and other reptiles part time , is constantly getting new ones or placing old ones with new owners or back into the wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone had them as a pet and did n't want them , or could n't take care of them , and I take them and either house them until I can find a home or keep them , " Anderson said . <p> Love of reptiles <p> Born in Farmington , N.M. , his love affair with all creatures reptilian began early . Anderson 's father , who worked in the state 's abandoned coal mine fields , used to bring young Anderson to work with him . <p> " We 'd see snakes out there laying in the road on the way to work and we 'd get out and pick them up and check them out . If it was a nice-sized bull snake that was n't aggressive , we 'd take it home , keep it for the summer and right before winter take them back out and let them go , " Anderson said . " That 's how I got interested in them and it just blossomed into everything else . " <p> Today , Anderson 's pets include several species , which change often depending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trips for personal enjoyment . <p> Anderson 's wife , Christy , no fan of snakes when the couple met , has warmed up some since . She allows snakes inside their house , except venomous ones , which are often kept outside overnight and then returned to the wild . <p> Another ground rule is no snakes in the bedroom - caged or otherwise , a rule the missus wo n't budge on after once finding an escaped bull snake in her bathroom . <p> " I turned around to flush the toilet and I looked down and there he was , " Christy Anderson said . <p> Brisk business <p> Jared Anderson is gaining notoriety across Montgomery County , in part because of the white lettered advertising he has stenciled across his truck advertising his business , " Pet My Snake " Rescue and Removal . <p> His other calling card is the work he 's contracted through various law enforcement agencies . That gig began when a sheriff 's deputy spotted him driving slowly down a county road and became suspicious because Anderson was scanning the grass bordering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or doing anything else illegal , but when the reptile rescuer spotted a broadheaded skink - a type of lizard - he was after , he stopped his truck and darted into the woods in pursuit . <p> The deputy gave chase , only to realize he was n't running after a fugitive but a zealous herpetologist , or a type of zoologist concerned with the study of reptiles and amphibians including their classification , ecology , behavior and physiology . <p> " I told him we were out looking for snakes and he told me if I was pretty good at handling them , why do n't you call the department because they get calls all the time and none of the officers are trained or want to go deal with snakes . So whenever somebody calls with a snake problem , they get in touch with me , " Anderson said . <p> Now Anderson fields emergency calls dispatched to several agencies , including the Montgomery County Sheriff 's Department , Montgomery County Precinct 3 Constable 's Office and The Woodlands Fire Department . <p> " Probably 85 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snakes people do n't want are most of those . The scenario usually is they do n't want to feed it or take care of it anymore , " Anderson said . <p> Wild life <p> Anderson is n't the only Montgomery County resident charmed by snakes . Edwin Soundy of The Woodlands is another whose fascination with slithering serpents has also brought him work capturing nuisance snakes across the area . <p> " I 've been working with snakes for 24 years . I 've caught snakes in The Woodlands , Conroe , Willis , Huntsville and Bryan . I do it for free , " Soundy said . <p> Soundy said he has been contacted on and off , but would like to use his love and understanding of reptiles to do more removal type work . <p> " I just caught a timber rattlesnake in Willis , he was 5 or 6 feet long . He was almost like a boa ( constrictor ) , he was so thick . I love catching them . I 'm a wild man . People call me crazy and I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soundy said . <p> Knowledge of snakes <p> For his part , Anderson ca n't get enough of reptiles . He works in a veterinary clinic , picking up knowledge on husbandry , medicine and rehabilitating techniques . <p> " It 's a fun job , " he said . <p> The 22-year-old , who is also studying zoology with an emphasis on herpetology at Montgomery College , said he does get some nuisance snake cases and calls to extricate an escaped exotic from beneath someone 's porch or in their garage . <p> His biggest , a 12-foot-long reticulated python he wrestled from beneath someone 's porch in rural Montgomery County , was an escaped pet he tackled with gusto . <p> " I took a friend and we got it out . It took us awhile . It was cranky and sprayed musk all over and made everything stinky . Every once in a while I 'll get something like that , " Anderson said . <p> Taking precautions <p> Anderson embraces snakes , but he is n't foolish . He handles all his serpents either with tongs or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've been bitten before , but I do n't mind nonvenomous species , " Anderson said . <p> He also wears military-style , bite-proof boots of thick leather , and chastises snake charmers like Steve Irwin , the popular Australian TV personality who handles snakes cavalierly . <p> " You grab any snake by the tail and that 's just going to rile them up , " Anderson said . <p> Besides making them mad , Anderson does n't like to hurt snakes and hopes to eventually do field study and conservation work . <p> Anderson said most of the snakes he keeps are small- to medium-sized because he believes bigger snakes often become too hard to care for . <p> " I like some of the big snakes and a lot of the people have the time and resources , but I think you should have to have special permits to keep anything bigger than 8 feet , " he said . <p> The Woodlands allows common household pets such as dogs and cats , but requires approval of its design review committee for exotic pets such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrictions . They do n't want you keeping cobras or anything like that , " Anderson said . <p> Feeding frenzy <p> Anderson keeps most of his pets content with a freezer full of frozen mice , a tasty snake snack . <p> He can also spit out facts and figures about snakes . He knows their habitats and personalities and he revels in his uniqueness of being largely unafraid of snakes . Anderson knows he 's different than most people . <p> " I do n't have a fear of them . I 'll run and chase a rattlesnake , but you ca n't push it on people , " Anderson said . <p> Anderson once saw one man take a chain saw to a section of wallboard inside a house desperately trying to flush a rat snake from inside his walls after the snake kept poking his head through a hole . <p> " Most people are afraid . It 's a survival instinct , " he said . <p> By Anderson 's reckoning , there are only a few snakes people in Montgomery County need to be truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is the venomous snake I get called for the most . We do have coral snakes here , but it 's rare to find those because they spend 90 percent of their life underground , but they 're the most toxic . Water moccasins are one of the other venomous snakes we have here , " he said . <p> Anderson is more than glad to pass along his knowledge of snakes to anyone who will listen , a circumstance which often gets him cornered by the curious in social situations . <p> " It 's a good conversation starter , especially when you meet someone new and they ask what you do for a living . I 'm happy to sit there for hours and hours and talk to people about snakes , " Anderson said . <p> ... <p> SNAKE BEGONE <p> Need a reptile removed ? <p> Call snake handlers Jared Anderson of Spring at 281-253-3481 , or Edwin Soundy of The Woodlands at 281-367-0704 . <p> ... <p> LOTS OF SNAKES <p> There are more than 20 species of snake indigenous to Montgomery County . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Eastern rat snake <p> Mud snake <p> Eastern hognose snake <p> Common kingsnake <p> Milk snake <p> Texas blind snake <p> Coachwhip <p> Bull snake <p> Southern water snake <p> Diamondback water snake <p> Source : Texas A &M; University <p> ... <p> SNAKE SAFETY <p> If bitten by a venomous snake , do the following : <p> Wash the bite with soap and water . <p> Immobilize the bitten area and keep it lower than the heart . <p> Get medical help . <p> If a victim is unable to reach medical care within 30 minutes , a bandage , wrapped 2 to 4 inches above the bite , may help slow venom . The bandage should not cut off blood flow from a vein or artery . A good rule of thumb is to make the band loose enough that a finger can slip under it . <p> A suction device may be placed over the bite to help draw venom out of the wound without making cuts . Suction instruments often are included in commercial snakebite kits . <p> Source : American Red Cross <p> NOTES : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
